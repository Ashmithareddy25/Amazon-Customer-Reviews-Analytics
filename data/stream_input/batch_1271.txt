B0010SKUYM|4.0|Here's a story with grand potential if you're a patient lover of fantasy.  The Name of the Wind is the first installment of the Kingkiller Chronicle trilogy by Patrick Rothfuss and sets the stage for what could become an epic trilogy.  If I sound a little non-committal then follow me so you get the gist.<br /><br />Rothfuss is an excellent descriptive writer and his focus on building this story and series around his central character is the engine driving the story.  Kvothe, his main character, is a very complex whole made of many interesting and painful layers.  You'll be captivated by his resiliency as a youth through the many challenges and tragedies.  Kvothe's strengths and incredible fortitude demonstrated in the early years are a significant contrast to the man he's become while recounting his life-story to the Chronicler.<br /><br />Kvothe, the boy, had a genuine curiosity about the world around him and a sharp mind to absorb whatever knowledge he could feed it.  A son of troupers, the talented future hero was destined to travel the world's roads a gifted entertainer but along the way he would find divergent paths.<br /><br />First he encounters Abernathy, his first teacher who began to unlock the vast potential in Kvothe's mind and planted the seed that would eventually lead Kvothe to the Arcanum University many years later.  Second, Kvothe tragically encounters the evil and mythical Chandrian moments after they slaughter his family and troupe.<br /><br />Now, filled with mind numbing grief, Kvothe sets out on a completely different path.  From total physical and mental isolation, Kvothe emerges from the forest to become a street urchin and beggar who learns that adaptation is key to survival.  Finally driven by dreams of the University and his need to understand his nemesis, the Chandrian, Kvothe discovers that his challenges have only begun at the Arcanum.<br /><br />While many of the more negative reviews take exception with this nearly flawless youth who seems to meet every challenge no matter the overwhelming odds, seeing some of the subtle and obvious defects in his later life sparked my interest.  How did he fall so far and what could possibly break such a powerful man?<br /><br />Like his main character, the plot is also many layered.  You'll follow the life of the young Kvothe as told to the Chronicler over one day.  The interludes between tales give you that peek into the highs and lows of a feared and revered hero and villain who finally became a broken man in hiding.  There are multiple seeds planted to give the reader a glimpse of the great light and the great darkness within him but the questions mount, particularly how and why to each of these aspects of Kvothe.<br /><br />You won't get all of the answers in this novel, in fact you'll finish with far more questions than you might expect.  If you're looking for a stand-alone fantasy novel to pass the time then you'll want to pass on this one.  But if you're a patient reader and are willing to see this through the entire series then don't hesitate.  The groundwork Rothfuss lays is designed to give you enough understanding of the larger picture while enticing you with questions in order to pull you into the next book for some of the answers.<br /><br />I will definitely read his next novel and I have high hopes for the entire series as it seems to have incredible potential based on this first part.  On its own I would give this book four of five stars with the caveat that it would be best to gauge the series as a whole based on how this one was written.  If subsequent stories follow the foundation in the Name of the Wind, it could well be an important part to a five-star series.overwhelming odds, seeing some of the subtle and obvious defects in his later life sparked my interest.

B00030DEQE|5.0|I'm always leery when upgrading computers, especially when you're going to replace an original component. Especially older computers where one component doesn't meet the latest standard that you weren't aware of, or upgrading one component doesn't help because there's another bottleneck with one of the other components. You know the drill - all of a sudden you're up a creek without a paddle and nothing works, you can't connect to the internet, can't even boot sometimes. What should be a 10 minute upgrade in many cases turns into 4+ hours, in many cases because of some little issue that wasn't clearly explained or documented.  In this case, upgrading to the Intel Pro/1000 GT Gigabit NIC in my 2004 era Dell Dimension 4600 REALLY WAS only 10 minutes. Very easy, no hassles. Well, actually 30 minutes because I'm paranoid and read these reviews for advice before actually pulling the switch.  Here's the drill (Dell Dimension 4600 with original on-board 10/100 NIC, running XP Pro):  1.) Make sure you have the driver CD that came with the package ready.  2.) Unplug the power from your computer (and disconnect all other devices so you can open the box).  3.) Open the computer, remove the back cover plate from 1 of the empty PCI slots (you do have 1 empty PCI slot right?), and then shove this network card (firmly) into the PCI slot. Screw it down with the screw from the cover plate (that you can now throw away).  4.) Close the computer and plug everything back in (remember to plug your ethernet wire into your brand new Gigabit NIC (not the old one), LOL.  5.) Turn on your computer. After Windows has loaded, etc., insert the driver CD that came with the package and let it do its thing. It will automatically find the new hardware and install the appropriate driver.  6.) Voila, you're done!  *NOTE:  I did NOT have to de-activate, disable, or do anything with the original on-board 10/100 NIC.  Now I surf at noticeably faster speeds! I noticed an improvement in internet performancewhen I upgraded my router and switch to Gigabit, and now a big jump in speed as soon as I installed this Gigabit NIC. Next step is to upgrade my internet service from 25 Mbps to 100Mbps now that my infrastructure is ready! I suspect once I upgrade all my computers to 2012 era machines I'll see even greater speeds.  If you have doubts like I did about whether this upgrade can help speed up your internet, don't worry it definitely makes things faster. Even with 2004 - 2006 era PC's, as long as all of your other components are Gigabit ready, you WILL notice a definite improvement when surfing the net. In fact, for $30 I'm going to upgrade the NIC in all of my older computers.  NOTE that my current network includes a Gigabit router, Gigabit switch, and Cat 5 (4 pair) cabling. So everything is Gigabit ready. And yes you do get Gigabit network speeds over Cat 5 cable - as long as you have good 4 pair Cat 5 and all connections are terminated properly. You may not get quite as good performance as Cat 5e or 6 if you have a lot of electrical interference or very long runs, but for almost all home applications your Cat. 5 wire will give you a Gigabit network just like Cat 5e or Cat 6.

B005HSG3TC|5.0|This shell is exactly what it needs to be: lightweight and unassuming. Fire fits cleanly and snugly. Elastic closure is great so far, and time will ultimately be the test it will need to pass. Overall, price point feels a bit high for what you get, but so far very satisfied and recommendation fits five star rating.
1594744769|5.0|If you like crazy, completely out of the ordinary, twisty and turney novels you will LOVE this book. I had it on my wish list for a few months - ever since I saw the cover and read the excerpts - before I finally decided to buy it. And I LOVED it! I couldn't put it down! Sometimes I had to put it down because it was too much and I needed to breathe but otherwise I just had to keep reading.   If you have already gotten curious with the cover and the pictures DO NOT hesitate. Spend the money. It's MORE than worth it! One of the best books I've ever read! :c)
B00005N6KG|5.0|These are kind of an unusual style, and they work well. Light, comfortable, sound is good, and they don't cram into your ear like buds.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|The film is about a young boys relationship with his family and the world from the point of view as a middle aged man. A different look and feel than Fredrico's Fellini's Amacord and 81/2. At times having  the feel of 2001:A Space Odyssey. The Tree of Life is a wonderful film that is both beautiful and poetic. The visuals are stunning, the Digital copy looks great on a iPad. I have not see it on Blue Ray nor the analog DVD yet, but if the iPad is good they might be as well.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|This is a great movie. I know that there are those out there who don't agree, but at the end of the day, I enjoyed it. Does it remind me a little bit of \\"The Goonies\\" and \\"E.T.\\"? Sure, but it does not matter. The blu-ray looks and sounds great and the inclusion of the digital copy makes this a bonus buy.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Puts a face to the characters in the book. They did really well in choosing women to play the different characters. Loved the book and Love the movie. Shows us just how fickle and silly southern women were and how they kept the bonds of slavery tight around the ankles of the Black women of that time.

B005TPCQ5I|4.0|While the movies are never as good as the book, this is a very good adaptation and well-acted.  I don't know why it was panned.
1594744769|5.0|When I bought this book I really didn't know what to expect.  I bought the hardcover (something I NEVER do) rather then the kindle edition or waiting for it to come out in paperback.  I am so glad that I bought the hardcover, no one makes books like this anymore.  Under the dust jacket is a red bound book printed with gold leaf, like the books in my grandfathers collections, the inside is highlighted with decretive paper, and black and white photos of the \\"peculiar children\\".  I think a lot of this book would have been lost without these pictures, something has to be said for seeing some things rather then reading the descriptions.  Now, you can't judge a book by it's cover and the outsides are never as important as the insides.  I am very happy to say that the insides of this book filled me with as such wonder as the outsides.  I'm not sure what I was expecting when I bought this book on a complete whim but what I got was a fantasy, mystery, time travel, friendship, coming of age novel with a little bit of romance.  This is very far off from what I normally read (I'm a history teacher, so I tend to stick to books within my content area) but would tell anyone to give it a chance.  I'm not going to outline the plot (I hate that, just read the book!) or anything.  But please believe that this book is worth the time and effort to read...I read it in 4 days!
B002ZG977Y|5.0|This movie is just as good if not better than the original. It doesn't waste it's time with long stretches of dialogue.  It cuts right to the action.  It doesn't linger on, at only 90 minutes.  I liked the medusa scenes and especially the creature battle at the conclusion. If you liked the original, you'll certainly like this version too.  I noticed the actor Pete Postlethwaite looks like he's plays Perseus's father. He puts in a good performance that grounds the movie.<br /><br />The extras present a few good cut scenes that were good but would have otherwise dragged down the film.  If you can buy it for under $10, it's well worth it.
0439023483|5.0|This was one of those books that I had a hard time putting down once I started reading it.  The characters are living in a post apocalyptic culture where the governing authorities believe that children should be sacrificed in order to maintain order and intimidate the local people into submissions.  The adventure and intrigue are so engaging that even if your'e not a fan of science fiction I think you will still have a hard time putting this book down.
0061714402|5.0|I've read several of these rock 'n' roll memoirs at this point, and just below \\"The Dirt\\" by Motley Crue (which is my favorite for its sheer entertainment value) this is my second favorite. I am not a Megadeth fan and have actually only heard a handful of Megadeth songs; it's just not my thing. But I was always intrigued by Dave Mustaine because in interviews on MTV and VH1 he seemed like a genuinely smart, thoughtful guy. He definitely proves himself to be that, and more, in this book.  It becomes obvious in reading this that Dave is a genius, and I don't mean a musical genius or a business genius, although he is probably those. I mean his IQ has to be off the charts, into the 180s at least. I have a theory about drug use in the music world, after working in live entertainment and knowing a lot of musicians personally. I think there are three types of drug-using musicians: one is the type that gets exposed and gets hooked because drugs are, well, addictive, and that's what happens, but they aren't necessarily trying to escape or mask anything. The second type is the person who does have something wrong with their wiring - childhood trauma or an actual organic or chemical brain disorder and they self-medicate it with substances. The third is the addict like Dave probably is, and I would put Nikki Sixx in this category as well - they are super-smart and therefore super-sensitive and feel things at maximum volume; things like rage or grief or embarrassment or even concern about the world are felt about ten times more intensely than other people feel them, and they turn to drugs to \\"turn the volume down\\" on the intensity of the emotions they experience. Mustaine strikes me, after reading this book, as a guy who feels everything at maximum volume and turned to drugs - and also to an \\"I don't care\\" attitude - just to cope with life. It happens.  The number-one thing I liked about the book is hard to explain - it's that Dave reminded me so much of guys I have known who outwardly have a lot of swagger and a lot of cockiness, and say and do things that are very arrogant and self-centered, but inside they are actually very thoughtful - painfully so - and kind of socially awkward, and really they just want people to try to understand them. Dave is really blunt about his shortcomings - his weaknesses for drugs and women, his arrogance, his perfectionism, his disgust for weakness in others and in himself, etc. He does not pull any punches on anyone, but especially not on himself. I have to admire that.  I didn't expect to like this book as much as I did. There are some interesting rock-history tidbits in here, and a whole lot about the ongoing very famous push-pull between himself and Metallica, which Dave knows he would be advised to let go of. There's also quite a bit of talk about Dave's famous conversion to Christianity and what he thinks it does and does not mean for his career and his life in general. A lot of what he had to say about his faith and how it has helped him through his struggles really resonated with me; he is the exact opposite of the insufferable, proselytizing Christian, but instead he speaks from the heart and what he says speaks volumes about himself and his belief.  All in all, a great page-turning read. I recommend it for fans of autobiography, even if they don't like metal music.
0385534639|2.0|If Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds joined a gothic circus, it would be this book.  I feel bad writing this review, because Erin Morganstern is a new writer and getting a book published is a huge accomplishment. Creating a body of work takes monumental effort; it is much easier to criticize. The originality of the premise is what initially drew me in, also the fact that this story was developed during the Nanowrimo competition. If feeling transported to a place is the most important thing to you, than you may enjoy this book. I enjoyed the images the descriptions evoked at first, but after a while the descriptions of the circus, the clothes, and the smells seemed repetitive, overwrought and left me feeling overstimulated. The atmosphere could have been conveyed with a lot less words. Every room was cluttered. The black and white theme went a little too far. I felt like we were supposed to be as enamored with the circus as the 'reveurs' were, but it did not happen for me. I got a good sense of the place but I didn't feel the same sense of awe that the ticket-holders had. Honestly some of the attractions would have freaked me out. The contents of the various tents were creative and clever, but felt a little melodramatic. Each element was always described using the same language. In the end, I felt as if I was a character wandering aimlessly and endlessly through the circus, in a dream where I try to run away because nothing is happening but I can't. The competition, which should have driven the plot, seemed to take a backseat to the circus itself. We never quite knew what the competition was about, and in the end it just kind of fell apart. Prospero or the man in the gray suit could have ended it if they felt like it. What were they doing it for anyway? I couldn't quite see why Marco and Celia loved each other so much, other than the fact that they were bound by the rings. As others have stated I was waiting for a big duel at the end but it just didn't happen. In the endthis magical story felt more like a sleight of hand.
1400079144|4.0|Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon, protagonist of both \\"Angels and Demons\\" and \\"The DaVinci Code,\\" arrives in Washington, DC to fill in at the last minute for a lecturer who can't make a presentation arranged by Langdon's old friend and mentor, Peter Solomon. For this man Langdon would do anything - and the mysterious person who actually wants him in Washington on this night knows it, and has used Peter Solomon's name to get Langdon there. There is no lecture.<br /><br />Thus begins a roller coaster ride of a thriller, the best of Brown's work that I have read to date (and as far as I can tell I've read all of his books). High literature this isn't, but a good read it is; and mind candy is all I expect when I pick up a Dan Brown novel. I do have one problem with this one, though, despite enjoying it so thoroughly. The final chapters left me feeling I'd been listening to an earnestly delivered sermon. Which, after reading the book as speculative fiction - which means accepting its premise with suspended disbelief - came as an uncomfortable jolt.<br /><br />--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of 2005 science fiction EPPIE winner \\"Regs\\"
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|This is a gift that has not been given yet.  But the package arrived on time and in perfect condition.
B002NPCSJG|4.0|As a huge fan of SF - but not the sub-genre military SF - I went into this book with somewhat low expectations. I had also heard it was very similar to [[ASIN:0312536631 The Forever War]], a book I found a bit boring. But I ended up pleasantly surprised: The Old Man's War was a well written, fast paced, humorous and moving story more about one Man's journey through a new stage of his life than about war tactics and training.  Oh, and he just happens to be green and in excellent shape.  Recommended for anyone who wants a touching and entertaining read.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|Movie arrived on time.  My only complaint about this set is the digital movie is Ultra Violet, and you have to join another online site with another user name and password to access the digital copy.  Too frustrating and not worth the effort.  I miss being able to download the digital copy by entering a code, and then the digital copy is yours without having to access another member website.
0571283578|1.0|I love PD James mysteries. I love P&P. But this mix doesn't work.  It's an unwieldy hybrid and ends up being thoroughly ho hum. I am very sad to say I believe it is a waste of both time and money.  The characters do not have (or acquire) depth, and the plot line is contorted.  It may have been an interesting concept, but it does not play out well at all. Wait for it to show up at the library if you must read everything PDJ writes.  (That's my affliction, and I can only wish I had had the patience to wait.)
0743437497|5.0|There have only been three books that I've read in my life that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. This one, [[ASIN:0312195265 The Silence of the Lambs]], and [[ASIN:0143039989 The Haunting of Hill House (Penguin Classics)]].<br /><br />Of those three, The Shining is at the top. It is an amazingly scary and well written book. The description mentions that this title set the benchmark for King's work. I feel it sets the bar for all horror writers. So far no one else has topped it for me.

The texture and flavor are fantastic.  Our favorites are the Chocolate Crinkles and the Peanut Butter Pillows.    The book itself is darling as it is full of colorful pictures and descriptions of each cookie.  This book is a must have.

B005TPCQ5I|5.0|This is a fantastic movie with a traditional European approach to relationship, which is much deeper and poignant than typical American.  Compare Anne Hathaway & Jim Sturgess in this, to Justin Timberlake & Mila Kunis in \\"Friends with Benefits\\" and you'll get my point.  All of them hot and sexy but \\"One Day\\" slowly develops like sensual foreplay and fine wine, where \\"Friends w/ Benefit's\\" well, the title speaks for itself.  Both have their purpose but my husband and I were blubbering idiots at the end of this one, and made us remember what really counts in life.......and yes, we know, Anne Hathaway is American.......but you would never know by her brilliant performance.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I got this because of its ability to be attached to an iPhone without having to remove the case (which works wonderfully).  I need a charging adapter because my car stereo equipped with an iPod/iPhone interface won't charge the device on its own; a charging adapter is needed for this.  The dockStubz fulfills my needs.  Except...<br /><br />When I connect the iPhone 4S to the dockStubz which in turn is connected to the docking cable to my stereo, it makes a loud oscillating noise akin to a motorboat sound.  It charges correctly, I can control the iPhone via the head unit, but it's so noisy that I'm sure it's defective.  Amazon will only issue a refund and won't do an exchange (pretty lame policy IMO).  I've contacted CableJive to see what they have to say.  But if I can't get one of these that works correctly it'll be a one-star review.<br /><br />I should mention that I have a different brand of charging adapter that requires me to remove the iPhone case, and it doesn't make any noise while allowing the iPhone to charge.  Also, directly connecting the iPhone to the interface cable to the stereo makes no noise but doesn't charge the iPhone.  So if I want to get an adapter that 1) charges the iPhone; 2) doesn't require me to remove the case; 3) allows me to control the operation of the iPhone via my head unit; this is the best choice.  I hope they can get me one that works correctly.<br /><br />UPDATE: After contacting CableJive, they sent me a replacement dockStubz that works correctly -- no noise, and does everything they claim.  It fits even when I use my Apple bumper case and charges as it should.  CableJive provided a return shipping label for the defective unit too.  As a result of providing a working replacement quickly and demonstrating excellent customer service, I'm changing my review rating to 5 stars.

B005XIYLKO|5.0|This release expands upon the original album. Before you resume reading, the import CD/DVD set is explicit, though a \\"Parental Advisory\\" sticker is absent.  Jessie J's debut \\"Who You Are, quickly became a favorite of mine as a top album of 2011. Her music transcends R&B, going into Jazz, Pop, even a bit pf Reggae with \\"Stand Up.\\" But, for some, there wasn't enough there to seemingly appease everyone. This release includes 3 bonus tracks. \\"Domino\\" has been out here in the U.S. since August, so it's nothing new, but still nice to have here. She sings with such amazing vocals with a rock influenced track. Many criticized it for sounding too much like a Katy Perry track. \\"My Shadow\\" further deepens Jessie's R&B sound, with music and vocals a la En Vogue. \\"Laserlight\\" with master DJ David Guetta has a very electro sound, showing that Jessie J can perform dance music to a new extreme. The music, however, sounds like a remix of David's other song \\"When Love Takes Over\\" featuring Kelly Rowland. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it just seems like David Guetta's music is very limited.  The DVD contains all of Jessie J's iconic videos from \\"Who You Are\\" and the \\"Live in London\\" UK TV special. The DVD should work in all players, seeing as it's Region 0.  The discs are contained in a metallic gold digipack with stills from the \\"Nobody's Perfect\\" video. Inside of the new booklet, stills from the videos from \\"Nobody's Perfect\\" and \\"Who's Laughing Now\\" are inside, as well as a photo collage of Jessie's personal photo collection.  This release is a must own for any Jessie J fan, casual or hardcore!
B0063IH60K|3.0|DROID X. The gameplay is good and dropping the cards onto the right place I found to be great. Drawing the next card was a bit of hit or miss. I sometimes had to press 2 or 3 times to draw the next card and can't undo the missed card when it works as expected; in other words, it happens much too often and I found it to be a bit frustrating. The cards and overall presentation are nice but the cards tend to be on the small side. I found there to be a bit of unused space in landscape mode which could have been used to allow for bigger cards. Aces &quot;tray&quot; (for lack of a better term) should probably be moved to the top when in landscape. Also, please better utilize the space in &quot;draw card&quot; area as it all could be bigger.<br />Sorry, more frustrating than fun for me. DROID X (landscape mode)
B001E45XT4|5.0|When I saw these were on sale for $25 I could not pass them up. For one they were bigger than I thought they would be, pretty heavy and made very well. Sound great to, music and gaming sound wonderful with these. Recommend them for any gamer out there.
0740748475|5.0|A truly magnificent book that I will enjoy for many years to come. I thoroughly enjoy dipping into it at different times of the week.
B000AADYUI|5.0|Paul Kantner / Jefferson Starship / Blows Against The Empire (2005 remaster with Bonus Tracks):  I'll say it up front, this is one of my favorite albums of all time.  There is nothing about the album I don't like.  As to this CD, I usually stop playing it before I get to the bonus tracks.  The bonus tracks are actually very good, but having bonus tracks at the end of a concept album is like having a blooper reel added to the end of Hitchcock's \\"Psycho\\"...it ruins the effect of the movie.  This post-Hippie Science-Fiction fantasy is worthy of a Sixth star.  It is a Masterpiece.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|I really like the style of this case and it does what it is supposed to do.  I too wish the groove would be a little deeper so it would stand up easier.  I hope that the elastic band lasts, it's getting slack in it already.
B0018PJEYY|5.0|The Moody Blues/ A Question of Balance (1997 remastered):  This is the Moody Blues best album in their series of Great albums.  Far from being an expression of harmony, it comes across as the story of someone about to fall apart, which may be the edge it needed to become the Masterpiece it is.  The 1997 remaster has the original album and no bonus tracks (which is the way I personally like it).  There is a newer release that contains bonus tracks.  I think that having bonus tracks on a Moody Blues album does little more than distract from the album itself, but that is just my personal preference.  Whichever CD you prefer, you will be getting a Masterpiece.
B003Y5H57E|5.0|i bought this movie for rental ! a lot of people rent on this movie so i think this movie great !!!
B004EPZ06G|3.0|The first Hangover is one of the highest grossing R-rated movies of all time.  What makes people think the producers were going to change the formula for a sequel?  So, please watch this movie with the understanding that the plot is exactly like the first--only the locale is different.  So, it has some laughs, not as many as the first movie, but there are some laugh-out loud moments.  However, in this movie there is a lot more nudity (male, female, full-frontal), drug use, violence and atypical sexual situations.  This movie lives up to the R rating, so NOT for children under 17!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have been working with computers since 1977. For the person who wants to remotely see and function with your home computer, this is priceless. It does everything you can do remotely, even a CTR-ALT-DEL. It's like you are sitting in front of it. It even uses any shortcut keys you have set up at home. You can play all of the music, pictures, videos you have on your home computer remotely. I create Microsoft Office documents remotely and file or mail them anywhere. I am an old guy of 70, but when I visit your grandchildren it's great to show them anything I have on my computer at home, even movies of their 1st birthdays. And the biggest feature is it works as an App or on any other computer you have. So when I want to do something involved I can use my laptop from anywhere I can get a WiFi signal, my family room, bathroom, car, Mickey D's or anyone you visit who has WiFi. Easy to install, but Splashtop support is unreal; it's the best I have ever had. I know I sound like I own the company, wish I did, these people know how to run a business.

0345529057|5.0|Bought them because we were too lame to read the books before the shows came out. I got it for my husband as a gift and he literally cannot put the books down. I haven't had a chance to read them, but he loves them. Great box-set gift.
0470424656|5.0|I hate buying textbooks for class, but this is the one textbook that i'm going to keep after class. It is more like a handbook as it contains an incredible amount of useful information on valuation. WACC, ROIC, EP, DCF it is all here the list could go on and on and ..... The later chapters in this book are more useful than the beginning chapters for those who are established in the field. This book is considered the Bible of Valuation, it really covers just about everything.
B005Z271Y6|2.0|I was hoping that a concert recorded in this decade with the best filming and recording technology would produce a great experience.  I was hoping BLU-RAY would top it off.  Before I roast the producers and editors, I must point out that Adele was absolutely perfect.  Her voice was clear, strong, and full of emotion, conviction, and she sold every song.  After buying the CD and playing it a hundred times, I could not wait to hear her talk during song breaks.  Adele turned out to be the real deal.  She is charming, funny, and thankful for the audience and the opportunity to perform.  The video quality was \\"average\\" (lighting, clarity, etc).  The sound quality was average as well, lacking dynamic clarity.  The Dolby digital opportunity was missed by the sound engineers and the band sounded muted and mushy at times.  My only solid beef was with the videoghraphy.  The effects they use to dramatize a scene were overused to the level that gave me a headache.  The camera cut to the next camera every 2 to 3 seconds and the fade in and out of focus on top of that ruined it for me.  The contant sweeping pans and zooms were visually painful by the time the second song ended.  I realize watching a great concert with a single fixed camera is boring.  However, the OVER THE TOP constant camera effects were over done.  How can an artist who sings notes that last 10 seconds permit four to five camera changes in one note?  how can a artist who has absolutely awesome phrasing allow the video effects take away from her hard work and talent?  I really contenplated rating this with only one star.
B004G600A4|5.0|My two and a half year old daughter has fallen in love with Rapunzel!  She has so many DVDs, but usually only asks to watch a handful of them, same ones over and over...  We got Tangled and watched it, and now it is in regular rotation in the most-requested DVD pile at our house.  Totally worth it!!
B004LWZW4W|4.0|I rent yesterday here in Brasil the Blu-ray \\"Rise of the planet of the apes\\"<br />Excellent video and sound. Fantastic EXTRAS with the Blu-ray.<br />We are just another animal specie. The apes are just less inteligent than us.  There is NO GOD that created any animal or plant, or that control our lifes. Great movie.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele has the talent that so many other big name pop artists lack.  She can take any style of music from any time period, embrace it, and release a hit.  Her first album bought me as a lifetime fan and this album takes just as many risks and still comes out on top.  Adele has a sound that should be heard by all.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|Feel secure that your new kindle fire will be well protected with this cover. It is indeed very light weight. the cover can be flipped to the back to use as a prop when veiwing movies. Seems very durable.
B005KJZDW6|1.0|A nice album, but the pressing of the vinyl has issues. I have the same problem that others have had, terrible noise like static coming from the album. It is very evident on the first track and presents itself in many places through the album. Part way through the second side it was so bad I had to shut it off. I tried cleaning it, checked my cartrige and the tracking weight, but it made no difference.   Get the CD instead.
1843106698|5.0|As someone who likes ready owner's manuals, but rarely needs to do so, this is a spectacular book.  Neurotypicals should be envious that there probably is no equivalent book that can explain so much of their life experience and behavior so concisely.  Thank you Tony Attwood.  You've changed my life.
B0036S4CTS|1.0|Really disappointing.  I still don't understand what Emma sees in the guy, but I liked her.  Very engaging until the author reached a point and copped out.  I won't tell you what it was, but it was like he said, 'hmmm I have nowhere else to go with this how do I end it', and did the equivalent of 'and then he woke up...'.
0670022705|5.0|I expected to like this book based on the pictures. I was pleasantly surprised to love this book based on the words as well. The concept of making a history out of so few things intrigued me and I was blown away by the author's grasp of the Big Picture. Also, various experts in addition to author Neil MacGregor are consulted for their imput. And the \\"finish\\", going right up to 2010, added a wonderful tweak of humor and inventiveness.  Everyone should have a chance to look at this book.
014312093X|4.0|This novel reminds me of the knots I used to pick apart with tweezers and pins when I worked in jewelry.  People would bring in their twisted chains in tight knots and I'd sit down with a magnifier light and tools and start loosening the mess; one part would give way, only to lead to more if it was a real good knot.  Some could be done in a minute, some took a half hour -- this story is the longer kind. A muddled ball of chain in the beginning, and over time, the whole thing gets loose enough to straighten out. A good, but sad, ride with Smiley and Co.
B0064J6OMO|1.0|Not so great, really was mildly entertained and although funny at times, it was really just overly crude. I was expecting more from Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman.
B004EPZ06G|1.0|Horrible.  Ladyboy s*x = not funny.  If you want to find out what I mean by that comment, please, by all means rent this movie.  If ladyboy s*x with one of the main characters is not your thing, then run.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Just had to give a quick mini-review for Drive. My top film of the year. It's not for everybody though - it has a unique aesthetic and vibe about it. It's nod to the sounds of the 80's might irk some; and the violence is extreme and sudden. It's not an \\"action movie\\" or anything close to 'Fast Five.' It's a story about our nameless protagonist, the driver and how he becomes an unlikely hero. Full of memorable scenes, suspenseful moments and iconic characters. Superbly acted and directed, 'Drive' is amazing. Just don't expect it to be like every other movie. It flows with a unique pace all it's own - it's not afraid to let things slow down and to allow long, deliberate pauses between lines of dialogue.
0385738773|4.0|After reading other reviews I wasn't that eager to read the final book but what a pleasant surprise ending to a really great series. The death cure in my opinion was by far the best book out of the 3 . Twists & turns & a great new world outside wicked that gets explored in vivid detail & as always there will be some shocks & unexpected deaths but I suggest reading the book to find out.
B0066W1AZK|2.0|can't save game and return later. must have feature. If you get a call or have to switch between apps game over.
B0016BWACI|5.0|You know, I read several of the reviews and while I don't wish to be contrary or argumentative about anyone's opinions, it does seem that some people don't have anything else to do but go on and on about trivialities.  This was a great movie, it always has been and will always be.  Jim Henson was a great mind with the heart of a child and a wonderful love for mankind.  His foray into moviemaking was a blessing for us all.  The moral of the story and the telling of it is nothing short of magical.  I don't care about the colors, the music or anything that isn't as it was really.  Just the story and my own imagination running wild with these characters is enough for me.  I was thrilled to enjoy this movie on Blu-ray as the only other copy I had was an old VHS that was nearly worn out!  I consider this movie a BUY whether it is perfect or not.  Let your imagination do the rest!
B0049GYXDQ|5.0|This movie introduces a new Disney princess, and is very enjoyable for people of all ages.  It is set in New Orleans during the Jazz age, and features amazing characters.  It is great for both boys and girls.  I highly recommend it.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|I think this is the most economical and protective case I've seen.  For the price, it's hard to find anything better.  I have a white iPhone 4S and it fits perfectly.  I like that the back is clear.  I've inserted my business card between my phone and the case so someone who finds it will know whom to contact.  I bought another one of these for my son.

1419702238|4.0|I loved this book, and the only issue I had with it is that Greg Heffley is supposedly a 6th-8th grader, yet he still believes in Santa Claus!  I was able to roll my eyes and shake my head through those parts of the book, and loved the rest.<br /><br />The book is very funny, and highly entertaining.  There aree lots of laugh-out-loud moments.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|I absolutely love my new Kindle Fire but was worried about taking it with me when I travel.  This zip sleeve is wonderful.

014241493X|4.0|This is the last of the three John Green books that I read one after the other, and I'd say this is my favorite.  Typical high school angst, but I really wonder at how Margo could be too hung-up and self-absorbed to have done what she did.  This however was wonderfully offset by her friends' normalcy and I should mention, comedy.    There were a lot of hilarious scenes, just as there were a lot of thought-provoking ones too.  So yes, those thought-filled parts somehow reduce my wonderment about Margo being so hung-up.  It talks about kids who struggle at the threshold between  childhood and adulthood.  Kids doing many crazy stuff, the same kids who think about their future, who look after one another.  It's a high school story that will appeal to even those way past school age.
B003PIUBZS|3.0|This series is interesting enough but I am surprised it has so many five-star ratings.  I'll give my view on the good and the bad.  To help evaluate my review, I can say that I enjoyed Rome, Deadwood, Sopranos, 24, etc. very much, so I enjoy \\"action\\" series, but this one got a few things wrong in my view.<br /><br />-The plotting is quite good--in almost every episode there is some plot twist which caught me by surprise and which pushes the story in some new direction.  Well-done!<br />-But the actual dialog is not well written in my view; the dialog generally seems very wooden and dull to me.<br />-The violence is over the top and really gets a bit silly.  Digitized fountains of blood, plenty of neck-snapping head blows with blood spouting from bloodied lips, etc.  Over and over and over again. And then again.<br />-I think that most of the characters are a bit two dimensional and predictable, and the acting not that great (with the exception of Andy Whitfield, who had a real presence).<br />-There is more sex in this series than I expected, and not just the occasional bare-breasted slave...<br />-the biggest thing I didn't like about series is that it has a very low-budget vibe; watching the series \\"Rome\\", I felt like I was in Rome, but while watching Spartacus I felt like I was on a cheap movie set.  Lots of not very well done digital effects, lots of repetitive scenes, general skimping on original atmosperics.  For instance, the \\"battle\\" scenes in the first episode were almost laughable, maybe a dozen guys hacking at each other, and then the Roman \\"legions\\" appear, represented by another half dozen troops.  Hardly epic...  Similarly, a large part of the series is taken up by showing the gladiators in training, and yet they appear to be doing the same things over and over again (basically mock fights in the courtyard with wooden swords, etc.), not much originality.  They could just about get away with this in the first season, since 95% of it was set in the gladiator school or the arena, but I think it will be much harder to do Season 2 like this, since they will have to depict the battles of Spartacus' army vs the Romans, and I don't think it will turn out as well.<br /><br />In general, Season 1 was enjoyable and entertaining enough, but I can't say that it was a great production.  While I'm sure I'll end up watching Season 2, I am not sure if I will like it as much, for the reasons described above, and because of the loss of Andy Whitfield.
B005TBN3EU|1.0|One of the worst movies I've seen. Amazon was great, but this movie was not. Nothing like the first movie. The reviews you see online are accurate. For some reason, I thought they all couldnt be. Avoid this movie.
B0000046ZJ|4.0|The Oscar Peterson Trio,one of the best ever.The productions Verve did putting together with another one of their headliners,fantastic in most of the cases and really good in the others.  I have had this for so many years, I had forgotten about it, the jewel case I will replace the disc perfect.This was probably one of the first CD's I bought and will go in a box with the rest of Stans work.  Stan was a great artist and so much of his work has a timeless quality. And as time passes, I am playing more of his music and have discovered the work done at the end of his career has qualities his early work lacked.  I can say this the Verve Silver and MasterSeries contain some gems, enjoy.
B0053JJLLC|1.0|PLEASE!!!  I usually like Crichton's novels because they are on the edgy side of sci-fi, and have a basis in scientific fact, but this book is a real loser!  Very sorry I spent any money to buy this drivel.    For those of you old enough to remember \\"The Incredible Shrinking Man\\" you have this entire thing in a nutshell-- only we have a whole group of \\"shruken\\" people to root for against the horrific nature of beasts that surround them--GARBAGE!!!  At least when that movie came out, I was a kid and it was rather fun to watch what would happen as our hero tries to kill a huge spider with a knitting needle. Perhaps the writer of the aforementioned piece should sue these guys for copyright infringement?  Anyway, I just muddled through the last half of this piece of junk to try to get my money's worth--didn't work.  If you haven't already purchased this thing--DON'T-- pick it up when it comes to your library, and even then, you'll be sorry you wasted any time reading it.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I usually am not the sit down and watch the entire movie kind of mom.  I have a 7 year old son who couldn't wait to show me this movie!  I was listening to him as he watched this movie, and enjoyed it so much.  I had to sit down to watch, and I have to say this movie is outstanding, really.  Has alot of funny parts, and sweet parts.  Makes the kids thankful to have what they have, and I love the music too. :)  Over all a 5 star movie, you won't be dissapointed.
B000002UVZ|4.0|Suddenly a much heavier presence in a very literal way, both the guitars and vocals on \\"Lifes Rich Pageant\\" are amplified considerably when compared to REM's three previous full-length releases. Most of the fans I knew who'd listened to them over the long haul responded positively to their \\"rural electrification\\",and if you give the CD a few listens-through, it's not difficult to pin down the reasons why: Mike Mills still provided heavy, thrumming, melodic basslines for Bill Berry to synchronize and propel his percussion, Peter Buck's jangly, angular, arpeggiated guitar lines weave their way through most of the tracks (though with a more aggressive edge) , and Micheal Stipe's lyrics remained enigmatic in some places, politically charged in others, but with a newly-found clarity to his vocals as a result of having been brought to the front of the mix making what he was singing easy to decipher within the level of just processing it aurally (deciphering the lyrics is another issue, altogether!)    And because of the decision to make these alterations to the production values, some of the tracks have a rich, lovely, texture to them without necessarily abandoning their trademark sound; indeed,  \\"Cuyahoga\\", \\"Fall On Me\\", and \\"The Flowers Of Guatemala\\" positively resonate with it- the difference being that full amplification has brought a heavier edge to Buck's riffing, and a bottom end that has an aggressivity making the hooks on some tracks more larger and more fluidly progressive than what's come before, REM selling it to us from the Jump on \\"Begin The Begin\\" and bookending it with their infectious cover of \\"Superman\\".    Micheal Stipe's activist lyrical content began to emerge in earnest on this release as well, and much of it is focused on a somewhat timely critique of the aggressive foreign policy cultivated during the Reagan years, even if somewhat obliquely and tangentially (\\"The Flowers Of Guatemala\\", \\"What If We Give It Away\\", and \\"Underneath The Bunker\\")or in an expression of perceived righteous indignation (\\"Cuyahoga\\" and \\"Begin The Begin\\"). Now and forever, beginning with this recording, Stipe fully abandoned his mumbling or murky delivery, his husky vocalizing more than adequate; in fact, frequently impassioned.    \\"Lifes Rich Pageant\\" is rightly seen as the transitional release between the \\"old\\" and \\"new\\" REM, but the underlying structure of the melody and distinctive instrumental flourishes locate it in that \\"timeless\\" zone they were aiming for as far back as the release of \\"Murmur\\"; something that could have been recorded two decades before, or just during the previous week, that can't be identified through universal points of absolute demarcation - the only difference here is that the band began to plug in for virtually every song. It's one of their strongest releases, and well worth getting.

0439023513|2.0|I read all three novels in the span of three days after completing a semester of a Master's of English program and wanting to read something and not have to over analyze or write on it-- yet here I am, voluntarily writing about a book I had no intentions of even giving a second thought after completing it.  This is how upset I am.  The book came highly recommended my friends and family; I was admittedly hesitant to start a new teenie-bopper series after being sucked in to the Twilight Bandwagon Brainwashing a few years ago.  I read the first book in the series and fell in love with Collins' writing style, characters and plot development.  Stephenie Meyer can only hope to write as well as Collins does in the first two novels of this trilogy.  Of course it is a little juvenile as is expected because it is meant for the young adult crowd-- but it is GOOD.  Truly.  One of the better concepts I've seen in both the young adult and adult genres for modern literature.    This being said, I am upset by Collins' efforts in the third and final book.  It is as if she felt rushed to finish out the trilogy.  The whole vibe of the book is wrong.  Seriously.  From the first page it does not feel right.  You know?  Collins immediately loses the style, characters and plot I initially fell in love with.  It only gets worse from the first page.  To make a long story short, if I had known that Collins royally butchers the third and final installment leaving me perturbed and bewildered at her choices, I would have never started the series.
081297381X|5.0|I read and enjoyed this book a while back, but I neglected to review it. My thought was that it was far enough in the product's life-cycle that whatever can be said for it, good or ill, had already been said.<br /><br />I am writing now only quickly to say that this book is amazing. While my marginal notes show that I didn't completely agree with Taleb's method or conclusions, this book has amazing impact. I am, even at my young age, pretty ossified in my positions about how the market works for all participants. What this book did is make me reevaluate those positions that were once set in stone. I have to admit, this is no easy task. I even sought out, and bought (though not yet read) the book that was the biggest influence on Taleb, The Misbehavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Financial Turbulence. I look forward to seeing the basis for the thought in The Black Swan.<br /><br />I advise you to purchase this book to help you reevaluate your views on the market. Even if you don't agree with him, Taleb's book will make you stronger by forcing you to engage with his mode of thinking. I write this because I came across an unexpected and unqualified endorsement by another respected radical thinker: Daniel Kahneman in his recent Thinking, Fast and Slow. It seems counter-intuitive at first, but both men are in the same project but coming from different angles: How does the market fail, and why.
B00656C6KK|5.0|To say that Doris Day's music has been missed would be an understatement! After 17 years, she comes back with this album and is pure heaven to hear that voice that so many of us have come to love over the years. What is most noteworthy, I truly believe, is that Doris Day's singing is up at the top with the best of them...Sinatra, Fitzgerald, Streisand, Bennett, etc. Let's not even touch the rest of her talented career, because it is tremendous.   I have had this album since it was released in the UK in September. I play it every day and have ordered the U.S. release which has added an additional recording called, \\"Stewball.\\" \\"Stewball\\" adds just the right touch, as Terry joins his mother and harmonizes with her through the song.  In fact, the album is dedicated to Doris' son Terry Melcher, who was a singer in his own right and sings a song called, \\"Happy Endings\\" which is quite poignant and reminscent of how we once viewed our lives. Sadly, Terry Melcher passed away in 2004, leaving a vivid mark that he himself made in the music industry. \\"Happy Endings\\" then becomes one of the real treasures of the CD, as Doris introduces her son into her album. In several songs, Terry provides background vocal along with his mother, not to mention that he wrote some of the music as well.   The other treasures include a song from the title of the album, \\"My Heart\\" and other new unreleased material, such as \\"Heaven Tonight\\", \\"This Is The Way I Dreamed It\\", and \\"Disney Girls\\". There are other songs in the album made famous by other artists, but when Doris sings them, the song is completely HERS! She is one of the very few who can take someone else's material and make it her own. You hear that so vividly in her rendition of Joe Cocker's \\"You Are So Beautiful\\" and Lovin Spoonfuls' \\"Daydream.\\"   The album broke the top ten in United Kingdom, and it is hopeful that it will do more than that here in the United States. The album is climbing high on the charts here, at Amazon.  There are some other songs Miss Day released on former albums, and all of which have special meaning to her. When you finish hearing the album, you will know why.   Through Ms. Day's collective recording career, she has sung an array of songs that have become classics over the years. This is hardly no accident, as you listen how she hits perfect pitch every time in every song.  The presentation of this album is beyond the perfection of anything else she has ever done, and that says alot for a lady who has charmed our hearts over and over again.  \\"My Heart\\" will capture your heart the way it has captured mine!   For those who think admiring Doris Day and her music makes you part of some kind of \\"cult\\", all I can say to that is everyone should be so lucky! I wouldn't want to ever have been left out.  There is hope that more of her unreleased material might be released later on. All the proceeds from this album are going toward Miss Day's Animal Foundation, so if you are looking for a perfect Christmas present this year, this is the one to buy! This CD is a must have for any one who likes good music, and if you happen to like Doris Day, it is all that much more meaningful.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig, amongst others, are great in this Western meets Sci-fi flick. This movie is action packed and at times just hilarious. Definitely worth seeing, even purchasing. Great movie..
B002ZG9774|5.0|Small town girl moves to the Hollywood to make it big has been done and done.  Burlesque does it with great cinematography catchy songs and characters that you like, dislike and identify with.  Aguilera can sing AND act and well Cher is a legend who easily could have been the punchline of the drag queen joke but nobody can deny that she's still got it.  This is an EXCELLENT popcorn movie maybe the critics panned it because they thought that they were supposed to.  Whatever the reason they were all wrong.  The blu ray has a great picture and sound.  Highly recommended.

1439152799|3.0|This book should have been a great book. Ms. Morton has a wonderful story and I loved the way she leads the reader to believe one thing yet once we see the same event from another character's point of view we get a fuller idea of what actually happened. That being said at times her writing style was almost distractingly overwrought, dialogue was brilliant but there were far too many pages and pages of \\"telling\\" versus showing (an old writing axiom) and finally one of her plot twist/double turns bordered on the ridiculous.<br /><br />Just say no to adjectives:<br />I understood the first few pages were suppose to be from a novel written in the style of different time period, however Ms. Morton continues this at times for her more current passages. In one section she mentions the sound of another character's reaction \\"The horrid, guttural gasp, followed quickly by a series of rasping sobs that swamped the air...\\" The character was not being strangled, but opening a long lost letter. Another description: \\"A round pool meditated at the center and the pair of fat geese had launched themselves across the sun-warmed surface, floating regally now as ripples chased one another towards the flagstone edges.\\" (and yes, my punctuation is correct - that is all one sentence) I'm not sure how a pool would meditate, but I reckon fat geese launching themselves across it would wreck its chi. I found myself skipping forward in pages to avoid all this over-writing which was not good - as mentioned, the story was a good one!<br /><br />Logic matters:<br />Slight spoiler alert: toward the end of the book the main character finds a portion of a letter written in 1916ish. Now the letter is fairly sophisticated in its content and writing style: \\"Never before has your writing taken the reader on such a vivid journey... I couln't help noticing, however, as I read the manuscript...\\". Within a few pages you find out who wrote the letter, however something about it put the story off kilter for me. I realized from piecing together some of the convoluted dates and events that the letter was written by another character when she would have been about 10 years of age.<br /><br />One \\"twist\\" too many:<br />Last but not least, something thrown in that really did the whole story a disservice. I did enjoy how differing points of view gave the reader a better understanding of what happens throughout the book - those \\"ah hah!\\" moments were brilliant. However, the true reason one character ends up with mysterious blood stains on her blouse was far fetched and very dissappointing (this is revealed toward the end of the book).<br /><br />The story and its moving back and forth between the 1940s and 1990s was very well done. I have not read her first book and will absolutely do so. What I'm wondering is with Ms. Morton's previous success that her editors backed off on the copy editing, when she would have greatly benefited from some tightening and a bit of plot refining.ogether some of the convoluted dates and events that the letter was written by another character when she would have been about 10 years of age.

B005OCFGTO|1.0|Very disappointed in this set.  Realized it wasn't an ultimate edition, but I really thought it would at least have all the scenes that have been shown on tv.
1451627289|2.0|I have been reading Stephen King since the beginning.  I read most of his early works and loved them all.  \\"The Stand\\" is a masterpiece and it scared the hell out of me when I read it.  He is not only a great horror writer, but he writes about being human so well.  \\"Delores Claiborne\\" was a great story about a woman who did what she had to do to save her daugher's life.  King really understood this abused woman and his insight has always impressed me coming from a man.  Then there was \\"Different Seasons\\" which included Shawshank Redemption and The Body (Stand By Me). Some of the best tales ever told.  The last book of his I read before 11/22/63 was \\"Cell\\".  It was awful.   11/22/63 is ok.  I was disappointed with all of the political opinions.  Mr. King's political affiliation is obvious.  I liked that it wasn't the perfect, happy ending because that's not how life is.  I liked the idea of the butterfly effect, that our choices and actions ripple across time and space, some more than others.  I like pondering the simplicity of life before technology. All writers have a way of weaving a story and King's method hasn't changed in 30+ years.  It felt comfortable in one sense to follow the character development and read the dialogue that seemed familiar because King's characters are mostly similar from story to story and I liked the infusion of It and good old Derry, Maine...made me feel like I was listening to an old friend tell a story.  But, overall, for me, the story didn't grab me.  I could put it down and wasn't wondering what was going to happen next.  I wish I would have checked it out of the library instead of spending money on it.  I'd give it 2.5 stars but the Amazon rating system doesn't allow halves.
0395389496|5.0|The Polar Express is a beautifully illustrated, well-written book with a lasting message.<br /><br />Little kids can not really understand it. They love the story of the boy, the adventure, the happy ending, and the lovely pictures.<br /><br />Much more important: our children sense the wetness of their parents' eyes. The message is important to mom and dad, so it is important to them.<br /><br />This is a book to read year after year, until your child will read it to the next generation.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|I'm surprised by the low reviews this book is receiving!  The premise of a shrunken world is interesting.  The story is a bit Jurassic Park- a bit Hunger Games.  Get the book from the library-it's a good lowpriced read.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|Love this cd!  It contains Bella's Lullaby, which is my favorite.  Songs are conducive to wedding and forever after.  Wish Mr Pattinson had done one of the songs.

0307959856|1.0|A very aptly named book--it's a fatal attempt to draw on and take advantage of a novel and writer of such magnitude, but which is reduced to a something entirely inferior. The original, beautifully developed characters have all but died with the victim.  All the repetition contained in its 290 pages could almost be condensed to 50 without much harm done, and so could be got over sooner and with less trouble.

1400095204|5.0|Half of a Yellow Sun by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie gives the reader an incredible sense of place and identification with characters distant in both time and space.  Direct involvement with the political unrest (in late 1950's Nigeria) was not a requirement for the violence to reach everyone's doorstep either physically or by association.  Amid longstanding government corruption, (until the 1960's) subdued ethnic tensions (mainly between Northerners and Southerners), and bouts of extreme violence (distant at first but reached each character uniquely), everyone struggled to find comfort.  The author highlights each character's pursuit of happiness, personal reactions to both the war and other people's deceptions, and their desire to be both international and Biafra (instant void of colonial rule in Nigeria led to some disagreement on ruling government to be settled with warfare).  No matter the race, beauty level, or lineage(family money), the author shows knowing who to trust and love as the underlying goal of all the characters.<br /><br /> I would recommend this novel to anyone who has felt out of place somewhere familiar or familial, a great read!
B005KAH7QU|1.0|The movie seemed very interesting but ended up being just distasteful.  Interesting but full of just downright immoral sickness.  At the end of the movie i could only say .... that was sick and messed up.  There is a lot of just aimless and gruesome killing, as well as a cup full of liberal views.  They basically have multi-gendered people and very perverted people introduced and also a lesbian scene with the main character and another little girl who is suppose to be like 15 or 16.  Then there is the religious view mentioned almost in passing, as if you couldn't tell by all the other stuff, that nature brings us closer to god.... but not THE GOD but any god and whatever you believe in whether krishna or whatever. And the moral of the story is.... we dont know, but post modernism.  Anyway , would not recommend watching this movie if you plan to have a bad feeling in your stomach during the duration of the movie.  ANother question is how is this even considered pg-13, in what way shape or form?
145551389X|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2971EVHP58PYI]]While a lot of people may be getting tired of Lady Gaga's zany outfits and long music videos, I'm glad to see her still going. What I thought for sure was going to be a one or two hit wonder turned out to be a pop culture phenomenon. I'm not trying to jump the gun here, but it really does seem like it's Madonna all over again. I would've gladly accepted a photo book showing off Gaga's hundreds of outfits, but this is something truly special. It might not be one of the best photo books to come out this year, but when Lady Gaga is the subject matter, and she's all for not looking perfect in every shot, that makes for a very diverse book.  Lady Gaga is all over the place in the photos here. Glammed, bloodied, painted, you name it. The sneak peek she shared on her Facebook page really was just the tip of the iceberg. There were a few shots that even had me open my eyes a little wider because they looked so good. Richardson did a phenomenal job capturing Gaga's style. I'm sorry that the video portion of my review isn't as good as it could've been- the lighting was poor and I was worried about the binding since all the copies I found seemed to be a bit weak, so I didn't open the pages as far as I'd have liked. Any big fan of Lady Gaga should get this book though. Over 300 pages of gorgeous photos for this price? That's a great deal. The only things keeping it from getting a full 5 stars are the binding issue and that I would've liked more close-ups of her face. I think Lady Gaga has one of the most real looking faces today, reminding me of Amy Winehouse (she's even said she dies her hair blonde so no one confused the two at first).  As far as photo books go, Lady Gaga x Terry Richardson is very good, and I'm glad it didn't try to be something it wasn't. I appreciate that there were no essays going on about the work that goes into the shots or wardrobe. This is nearly all photographs with little text. I highly recommend picking this up in the chance that it goes out of print like so many others have lately.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|Nice but a wee bit too lightweight for me.  I am concerned with the longevity of the cover and how much real protection it gives. The spine seems rather flimsy.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|The video was of Pink Floyd Live in Earl's Court, London!!! What an awesome video to have!!! I am a huge Pink Floyd fan so for me this was an awesome show, standard definition, but great video quality.  I have been wanting this DVD for years, so Its a pleasure to have it in my collection!  It arrived way ahead of schedule, and I would definately do business with them again!
B001JNNE64|1.0|I'd really like to see the movie \\"Amadeus\\".  However, I am forced to watch the director's cut.  I'm sure someone decided this was a better version, but I really prefer the original.  There is a reason these scenes were cut.    At least give me the option to see the original on blu ray.  I don't want an extra 30 minutes that take the movie from amazing to 'overlong'.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Unless you're someone who hangs out at Star Wars conventions, you will have no complaints about this version.  Picture is top notch and the music/sound is absolutely incredible.  Watching with my kids for the first time and there are some subtle ties to the prequel series which are highly non-offensive if you ask me.
1451627289|1.0|I love time travel stories, and the premise of saving Kennedy from assassination was compelling. I bought the Kindle version (expensive) without looking at page count. Will this book ever end? I'm about 70 percent done and can barely slog through it. Loved the first part about time travel and changing the past/future. But his second visit to the past could have easily been cut by 200 pages without missing a thing. I'm now skimming paragraphs just waiting to get back to the Oswald part of the story. It's got to get better, right?  I can't recommend this book as it is sooooo long and goes on and on and on about the same details over and over and over. I no longer care about the characters, I'm just wanting to see how the Kennedy assassination plays out.   Wait for the movie. Get it on demand. Fast forward through the droll parts.

0316017930|4.0|Gladwell's keen eye for the obscure empirical information, available to many but only relevant to him, gives us more than a little to reconsider about our culture.   Academics will thrash his analysis of IQ Theory, Bell Curves and such, but it is hard to not doubt the generally accepted wisdom he pulled apart.  Since he excels at observation and writes so well, his examination of the unintended consequences lead me to question the general accepted conventions in the culture.   Does he need to go the nth degree to underline the advantages of ballplayers and hockey players given unfair advantages merely because of the month of their birth? No his ideas are good enough for me and I am sure more books will produce more ideas and more is better.  I recommend this book to understand the significance of deeper analysis of the culture and our need to question conventions always.
B004RLEBTY|4.0|I saw these guys live and decided to buy their album as I was pretty impressed with them, as musicians.  I think it carries over to this album as well.  There are some pretty great riffs on this album that keep me listening to it again and again.  A bit of a Sabbath vibe, as I have heard from others before.  If I was gonna give any complaints, my only problems were a few songs sounding too much like Queens of The Stone Age.  I understand that Red Fang is stoner rock and similar, but I would like to see them further branch out from that.  Also, in a few songs the lyrics sound like Rob Zombie, but I think it can be overlooked by the good songs on here.  I really like \\"Malverde\\", \\"Throw Up\\" \\"Painted Parade\\" \\"Number Thirteen\\", and \\"Human Herd.\\"  It is still a great album all the way through.  Great cohesion as a band.

B003Y5H4YI|4.0|Set in 1965 and 2003 \\"The Debt\\" develops two parallel stories about Rachel Singer (Jessica Chastian playing the character in the past and Helen Mirren in the present),Stephan Gold (Marton Csokas and Tom Wilkinson ditto) and David Peretz (Sam Worthington and Ciar&aacute;n Hinds ditto) three Mossad agents tasked with catching a Nazi war criminal Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christiansen)in East Germany that goes horribly wrong. In the present Rachel, Stephan and David must deal with the consequences of their actions in 1965 bringing these three unwilling participants back together for a final \\"mission\\".<br /><br />Director John Madden (\\"Proof\\") and writers Matthew Vaughn (\\"Kick-Ass\\", \\"X-Men: First Class\\"), Jane Goldman and Peter Straughan adapt the 2007 Israeli film  [[ASIN:B004VDA7ZA The Debt - Hachov- Israeli Hebrew Drama Movie (English Subtitles)]]give an edgy quality to their gritty remake. The film has terrific twists and turns that nicely keep viewers guessing and on the edge of their seats; did they grab the right person? Will Vogel's taunting trip them up or will one of them do something rash?<br /><br />The only flaws with the film is that the alternating storylines taking place in past and present tends to dissipate the tension as well as the fact that we really never learn what motivated the characters to become Mossad much less take on this mission (beyond the loss of Rachel's mother during World War II in a concentration camp).<br /><br /> The casting is terrific though with each actor doing a nice job of tailoring their performances so they seem as if they are playing the same characters. Aging the actors or using CGI to make them appear older would have distracted and pulled audiences out of the film (or at least me) and casting different actors that resemble each other to play characters 40 years later works for the film.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks quite nice with a nice, sharp presentation that's free of over processing. The presentation stays true to the theatrical presentation of the film--the greenish, cool tinge for the scenes set in 1965 East Germany adds to the oppressive look set behind the Iron Curtain. Fine detail is remarkably strong throughout in what was reportedly a 2K high def transfer.<br /><br />The lossless DTS audio impressively presents both the action and the quieter scenes that are dialogue driven.<br /><br />The special features include an audio Commentary with John Madden and Producer Kris Thykier where they alternate between giving us insightful observations about shooting the film, the characters and what they wanted to accomplish to merely describing the action.<br /><br />We get three featurettes including a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the film, an interview with Mirren discussing her character and \\"The Berlin Affair\\" which focuses on all three characters, their dynamics, etc.<br /><br />\\"The Debt\\" has some terrific performances and although the structure doesn't always work to the advantage of the film, it's well worth checking out.sh, cool tinge for the scenes set in 1965 East Germany adds to the oppressive look set behind the Iron Curtain.

B005FISBTO|5.0|UPDATE: This review is about the show itself, not the hackjob that Showtime did to the DVDs/Blu-rays, giving away the ending in the first two minutes.<br /><br />Finally, Dexter has to to confront religion.  Remember season 1, episode 1, where Dexter was murdering his first victim (that we saw), who was praying for help, and Dexter said, \\"That never helped anyone.\\"?  Well, that same Dexter, the same serial killer, now has a son about to go off to school, and he has to make some major decisions in his life.  Will he raise his son as a religious, Catholic boy?  Does Dexter himself need to further explore his own faith and beliefs?  Dexter truly becomes interested in religion in this season.  What does it mean?  Why do people worship a God?  And why should Dexter, a serial killer, have any kind of faith in a higher power?  These are all questions that Dexter explores this season with the aid of his growing son, his sister, Brother Sam, and the major storyline (Doomsday Killer).<br /><br />I watch a lot of true crime television, and I know that there are and have been plenty of serial killers who led normal lives on the side and shocked people when they were eventually discovered.  I am always curious as to the emotions that go through their head and what drives them, and Dexter kind of gives us a glimpse into that.  While of course the show is highly overdramatized for the sake of entertainment, there are flashes of real raw emotion from Dexter that makes me shudder and think, \\"there's a serial killer.\\"<br /><br />Like I said, this season is obviously focused on religion.  Dexter develops an odd bond and curiosity/suspicion with Brother Sam, a murderer/drug addict turned priest.  Brother Sam claims that God helped him \\"ease his dark passenger,\\" I guess you'd say, and Dexter becomes extremely interested in whether or not this is possible for himself.  Also, Dexter's sister, Debra (played by Jennifer Carpenter), is AMAZING this season.  She finally decides to open up to people, and her emotions are so raw, intense, and real.  Debra seriously wants to learn more about Dexter and become closer to him, and that is a recurring theme throughout the season.<br /><br />The main killer in this season is the Doomsday Killer, who especially targets women based on biblical text.  This is another method that forces Dexter to confront his feelings on faith and religion.  He even bluntly asks Batista, completely serious, why he believes in religion.  Dexter never really thought of these things before, but now with a son, he feels societal and fatherly pressure to make changes.<br /><br />Next season, please!people, and her emotions are so raw, intense, and real.

B001P06GX4|5.0|I absolutely love this game! My oldest son is 7 1/2 and I am so glad that the days of candy land and cootie are gone and the days of blockus are here!!!!! This game is so much fun to play.  I wasn't sure I would like it, but it had so many good reviews I decided to give it a try.  I was not disapointed.  The whole family likes it, but grandma, mom, and 7 yr old are completely hooked.  The strategy is addictive. I see the puzzle shapes in my sleep:) The more you play, the more strategy you pick up, but you don't even realize that until you've been playing for a while. I ordered qwirkle at the same time and we much prefer blockus! I especially like that it is basically self scoring. unlike quirkle, where you have to add up keep a running tally of your points.  Blockus is much easier for my 7 yr old to play with a friend or brother without adult assistance.    The only negative I have is that the best way to play is with 4 players.  You CAN play with 2,or 3, but then the players have to double up and be in charge of 2 colors.  I would not let this keep you from getting the game, but just something to consider.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Not sure which of the trilogy is my favorite or if I feel like the end gave me a sense of real completion, but the series gave me a passion for reading just like the twilight series, but in a nonvampire and post apocolyptic way. In other words, be ready to not sleep and read all three quickly! Great for readers of all ages.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am not usually a huge fan of Stephen King, but I fell in love with this story from the very beginning. The time traveling and stopping JFK's assassination is more the backdrop for the real story which is the personal journey of Jake Epping. This novel is well researched and is an interesting glimpse into an era long gone.
B0017CW5J4|3.0|The Complex Tour DVD is a much better concert than this release.  But the Complex is not Blueray and it plays on a smaller screen than my large flat screen.  So I bought this one, hoping it would be AT LEAST AS GOOD in High Def.  It is not, you will miss Venus Hum.<br /><br />A good point is that there are many interesting extras.  Overall, I found the main program a bit boring.  I guess I'm finally getting over the Blue Man Group.  Seen them 3x.
B002YMWPUA|4.0|\\"Hunger\\" is a difficult film to watch. Chronicling the final weeks of the life of Bobby Sands, the IRA activist who, while in prison, embarked on a hunger strike that killed him after 66 days, the film also depicts the brutal conditions endured by Sands and his fellow inmates. The deplorable conditions, merciless beatings, and abject hopelessness are portrayed in a startlingly bleak and powerful manner. Michael Fassbender's portrayal of Sands is utterly remarkable, and the 17-minute scene at the center of the film--in which Sands and his priest discuss the merits of the hunger strike and Sands' motives for going through with it--is both crucial to the plot and a strikingly simple yet bold cinematic gambit that delivers a profound thematic and dramatic punch. Filled with stark images and gut-wrenching performances, \\"Hunger\\" is a sad and remarkable film.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|I really had little idea what this film was about until I saw it.  I remember the trailer on TV some time ago and thought it would be interesting.  It is.  It has a sort of similar theme as \\"Inception\\".  It starts off a little hard to follow but becomes clear in the end (thank God).  I going to keep it and watch it again some day, so that's a good sign.  A movie like \\"Super 8\\" I would never watch again in my life and I will get rid of it at the first opportunity.  Sucker Punch is worth seeing and wondering what the heck is going on here.
B005FUTBWS|4.0|Kevin Smith's \\"Red State\\" ruthlessly satirizes just about every form of extremism that you can identify in contemporary American culture--religious fanaticism, governmental bureaucracy, political hypocrisy, sexual obsession, and homophobia, to name a few--and it does so in decidedly perceptive and entertaining fashion. Ironically, Smith himself has taken his cinematic style (well-known by his beloved fans) to similar extremes--the violence here is brutal and abundant, the hypocrisy is rampant, the fanaticism is unapologetically self-righteous--and the result is an all-too-plausible story of what could very well happen when a religious zealot is so thoroughly convinced that he alone understands what \\"God\\" wants, the government is so thoroughly convinced that it knows precisely how to handle religious zealots/domestic terrorists, and some horny teenagers get in the way. The script is intelligent, the directing is sharp and effective, and the performances--especially John Goodman, Melissa Leo, and Michael Parks--are outstanding. Don't miss this one.
1612130283|5.0|I have been reading her side fiction/fantasy work for a long while now, and when I heard she was going to be published, I hopped right on the train. Got sucked into her own world of fantasy with erotic and beautifully delicious moments, heart pounding scenes, laughter and then just heart-strings pulling tears. I am in love with both her novels! I recommend her books to people who will enjoy it like I did.  Who will fall in love with the characters and become part of the book instantly.

1612130585|5.0|I have been reading her side fiction/fantasy work for a long while now, and when I heard she was going to be published, I hopped right on the train. Got sucked into her own world of fantasy with erotic and beautifully delicious moments, heart pounding scenes, laughter and then just heart-strings pulling tears. I am in love with both her novels! I recommend her books to people who will enjoy it like I did.   Who will fall in love with the characters and become part of the book instantly.   Now, I am twiddling my thumbs waiting impatiently for the third to arrive.   Who is joining this journey? Cause it's one hell of a ride!
B004W89N72|4.0|I really like the Note Calendar.  It lets me make notes, as well as mark important days, \\"To do\\" lists, etc.  You can do reminders, and the vertical display lets you see each entry, including the items in the \\"To Do\\" lists.  Very handy for short-term scheduling as a non-computer option.  I picked it because it looks reasonably professional and because it doesn't have to sync with any website.<br /><br />I bought the $1.50 version, so I don't have any problems with ads.<br /><br />The only thing I can't figure out is how to delete a reminder. To save memory, I like to delete old notes, appointments, etc., when they're past.  If anyone knows how to delete a reminder, please add a review or comment.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This version of solitaire is fine. Just a basic version like what would come on a computer. It is no better and no worse than any other I have used. I like playing solitaire, so I like it. You can change the background, the picture on the back of the cards, and whether you turn over one or three cards at a time. It will score the \\"standard\\" way, \\"Vegas\\" or not at all. All seemingly pretty standard for a digital solitaire game. (I have played similar versions on personal computers.) This app is being used on a Kindle Fire. It is the first Android device I have used so I cannot give comparisons of this app's performance on it vs. on a phone or other tablet. Works fine for me and I have not noticed any problems with it. Also, it was free. If it's free and works, it can't be a bad thing.
0385535139|4.0|John Grisham is great when he writes about unscrupulous rich lawyers who take on mass tort cases against the tobacco or gun industry and use all kinds of improper tactics to win their case. Such lawyers appear in this fine, frequently humorous novel, but the main focus is on two incompetent lawyers who stumble on a mass tort case and join up with the expert rich mass tort attorneys. One is a man who has had two DUIs and is hoping he can control his drinking. He has also had four divorces. The other is an overweight failure. Neither one has ever handled a jury case. In fact they made their money as ambulance chasers who settle accident cases. The two are constantly arguing with one another. One day, a young Harvard graduate attorney who worked for a big firm for five years, but never went to court, stumbles drunk into their office and tells them he wants to quite his $300,000 a year job and work for them. The three become involved in a drug mass tort case where they and the mass tort lawyers are convinced the drug is killing people. Needless to say, they are over their head. They don't know how to behave in court or with their clients.
B002TOJHCM|2.0|The formatting isn't properly done, so there are pages with only the chord diagrams. Also, the text size jumps around, and the line breaks don't match the hard cover edition. They missed a huge opportunity to do this right, in keeping with the tradition of Hal Leonard chord books doing only the minimum necessary. A real disappointment.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I can't stop playing this game!  I should be studying for finals instead bit it is addictive.  Nice graphics and music.  They must have fixed the Fire problem because I have not had any of the problems other Fire users have.  Definitely worth paying for!
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This is a classic short Christmas film that everyone should see. Even though the dvd starts with a message that says it has been formatted to fit your screen, it is in the correct aspect ratio. The film was made and is meant to be in 1:33:1.  Anyone that enjoys watching all the classic holiday short films will love this picture as well.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|i loved the first two books and expected the same from this one. i felt like the book dragged on and the really picked up in the last two chapters. i wish it would have been less about the war and more about their lives and more drama. thats what i love about the books and i dont feel like that was shown in this one as much. its a must read to tie up the series though.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is easy to read and the story is original, and captivating from the first page to the end... and of course makes you want to read the next book.  The characters, and the environement where the story takes place is very well described. It seems real enough. I like how the author doesn't take the readers for fools, I was surprised by some of the events in this book. Of course some of it is predictable but still leaves me want to know more. I already recommended this book to all of my friends and have purchased the next one.<br /><br />On a sidenote, I am very excited for the movie coming out in march 2012... hopefully the book will be well reflected.  I already like the choice of actors so I think I wont be disapointed.
B004LROUNG|5.0|[[ASIN:B004LROUNG The Litigators]] by John Grisham is near the top of the list of legal tort books. At first, I thought, \\"Oh, no, is Grisham in a rut?\\" But it wasn't long before I was thoroughly immersed in Grisham's spellbinder. A mix of quirky characters, legal plotting, and courtroom circus makes this one of the most entertaining books I've read this year.    Thanks, Mr. Grisham.    Addendum 9/9/14- \\"The Litigators\\" was just as enjoyable the second time around. Crazy but credible. Highly recommended.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|I just watched the blue ray version of this concert and was very impressed! I have never seen Adele and really didn't know anything about her. After watching this dvd just once, I can tell you it is easily in my top five concert dvd's! It usually takes me a few times of watching a dvd concert to really start appreciating it. Not with this one! Adele connects with her audience at a level that is very rare in big concert venues. She takes the time to explain the motivation behind the lyrics. This insight into her music brought me to a whole new level of listening enjoyment. I was certainly taken back at first by her use of the \\"F\\" word, but by mid concert it didn't bother me at all. The sound quality was excellent! I watched this with my wife and we both had tears running down our face by the end of it. The emotion in this concert is like none other. Adele's voice is incredible! I highly recommend this dvd!

0439813786|5.0|In its tangible form The Invention of Hugo Cabret is like a thick dictionary. I wish this book was in Kindle form. I loved reading it. It has more illustrations in it than a typical Doctor Seuss book. Also the pictures were expertly drawn, no caricatures. I think that I would pay up to $15.00 for a kindle edition of the Hugo Cabret book. Whether it is digital or hardbound, get the Hugo book. The book was better than the movie. This is not to disparage the actors, but the way it is. There is more depth and characters in the Hugo book, plus I love the ending.<br />The story is about a boy who loses his father to a fire, loves movies and meets a girl who is an avid book reader. Hugo Cabret is a talented horologist (clock maker) who goes to work and fixes the automaton that is suppose to write a message or drawing. Read the book and enjoy the story.
B005LAIGFU|5.0|The director has taken a very unusual course here.  One that should be applauded.  Instead of trying to film the best selling book, which is also a five star effort, the screenplay recreates the book as a visual form of expression and storytelling.  It is one of the most visual films I've ever seen.  This also would have been a very hard novel to convert to film if you were going to follow it verbatim as it was entirely a series of letters from the wife to the husband after their son Kevin kills a bunch of kids at his high school. Letters are not used at all in the movie.<br /><br />Tilda Swinton as the mother has the lead role by a wide, wide margin here.  The others had a bit wider roles in the book but that's ok.  Swinton does an outstanding job and I am sure come Oscar time she will at the very least be a nominee for lead actress. One aspect conveyed in both the book and the film is that the mother and Kevin not only do not bond when he is young, but the mother also has a major case of untreated post partum depression for a very long time following his birth.<br /><br />Let's face it, when one of these mass murders happens in a school and the murderer is another kid, we all want to find something wrong with the parents to explain it. So do the people in this exclusive suburb and the mother is a pariah post murders. She gets her face slapped on the street, her house spray painted red, and her groceries ruined in the market, as just a sampling of daily life.  Prior to this, she was a wealthy world adventurer and author but you'd never know it afterwards. I'd say it was unbelievable she didn't change her name and move but the remarkable thing is that the parents in the real life cases do tend to stay put.  Both the Harrises and Klebolds are still in Littleton, Colorado, under the same names, for example.<br /><br />At the very least, one must admit that Kevin is strange. Not everyone can see it, of course, and certainly his father can't at all. Not to put too fine a point on it, he is a pretty disgusting child with absolutely horrendous habits. Many of us would need to be saints in order to parent Kevin. I couldn't do it. Faced with the doting father and this awful kid, I would just get a divorce and gladly give my husband sole custody of Kevin, which he would be only too glad to accept. Although they start moving in that direction when Kevin is in high school, I would have been moving in that direction when he was 3-5 instead.<br /><br />One odd point is that an extremely good looking young man, Ezra Miller, was hired to play Kevin as a teen. I'm not entirely sure that someone this beautiful could ever be easily be reviled by anyone.  History is replete with great beauty seducing the multitudes.  I've seen Miller before on series tv.  I'm always struck by his exquisite alabaster skin, beautiful bone structure, gorgeous hair and eyes.  It is a bit jarring to jump from the creepy little Kevins to Kevin the gorgeous teen. He also has a wonderful voice  No one else seems to notice this extreme attractiveness.  He was as creepy as a teen as he was as a child in the novel, by contrast. Fortunately, he is a good enough actor to convince you something inside is wrong after you get over the initial jarring effect of seeing him.  Ezra Miller is an excellent enough actor  to convince one over the long haul that he is twisted inside despite the beautiful exterior. I think he is a young actor to watch for the future.disgusting child with absolutely horrendous habits. Many of us would need to be saints in order to parent Kevin. I couldn't do it.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|I love a well written book. This is one of them. It is an amazing book about an amazing person. Granted, you will reach half way through the book and be convinced that Jobs is a jerk with every sense of the word. However, you'll know that he's a jerk who got things done.  The book took us down the path of the creation of Apple, the ouster of Jobs from it in the 1980's and his creation of NeXT and Pixar, and finally to his second coming to Apple. It explains clearly the stories that lead to Jobs's hate of Microsoft and his semi-respect for Bill Gates. Google and Eric Schmidt, Google's former CEO, started out as a partner of Apple and Jobs but turned to enemies towards the end of his life. He felt betrayed by Schmidt, who was also a board member of Apple, since he lead Google into competition with Apple when Apple stayed away from Google's territory-namely, online search. His hate for Google lead him to vow to destroy Android. Both his hate for Microsoft and Google stemmed from the same reason; that both, according to Jobs, stole Apple's ideas. The first being the graphical user interface and the latter being the iPhone design and the multi-touch user interface. Nevertheless, in the final days of his life, he did allow Google's founder and current CEO, Larry Page, to come to his house and did offer him some advice as to how to be an effective company leader-which was a nice gesture from Jobs's part. Sadly, the world did lose a great man last October who did make a positive impact on out lives.  The author, Walter Isaacson, does a great job in capturing the emotions of the periods and the stories he's telling us. Although the book is sanctioned by Jobs himself, it is surprisingly honest. For example, he explains thoroughly why Microsoft did not really steal anything from Apple and Isaacson tried to explain the two sides of the arguments objectively. Something tells me that this is not the last we have seen of Isaacson about Jobs. The book is too brief and there is definitely more that can be said about Jobs and his life. All in all, I had a great time reading this book and did not want for it to end.
0679879269|3.0|I'm just going to come out and say it, this book is a hot mess. But that's not to say that there weren't some very good ideas going on. I was hoping that things wouldn't slide completely off the table as it appeared to be with most of the Subtle Knife, but I was badly mistaken. I'm not sure whether or not Philip Pullman was on a tight schedule (which he probably was) but there are just so many disjointed, fragmented pieces of this book, it felt like he had the makings of masterpiece and dropped it, and the resulting book became the pieces he attempted to glue back together.   Let me preface this review by saying I have nothing against the heavy handed anti-religious overtones of this series. But subtlety is the key word, and there is nothing subtle about it in the Amber Spyglass. It was the way that it was conveyed in this book that bugged me, especially towards the end. If this is a young adult book, what kind of a message is it when you come right out and say that just because God doesn't exist, that you must then feel disconnected from the universe? Where is the heart in that? It almost felt as if the author might as well have stood on a soapbox and announced, \\"You're foolish for believing in God.\\" And that is just my problem with this particular book, as I didn't feel the atheist message was so bombastic in the first two entries. It feels like it has an agenda in this book, and that's when fiction stops being fun. Story tellers tell stories. What they don't do is tell us to think a certain way. But I'm not here to talk about that. I'll talk about the storytelling, as it seemed that Philip Pullman neglected keeping this all important aspect together.   To me, the series lives and dies with Lyra's presence. I personally felt the book dragged when Lyra was unconscious for most the first part. What you have left is Will, and I still feel his character's legs just aren't strong enough to keep things moving on his own. I was both thrilled and finally happy to see the return of Iorek Byrnison, and see that he played a crucial role in this novel. Serifina Pekkla on the other hand, is virtually written out of the story until much later. What she does for most this novel's time is anybody's guess, but I was profoundly interested to see how she would deal with Mrs. Coulter (the arrow she swore to put through her neck) and Pullman does nothing with it. How sweet would it have been to see the witch struggle to accept Coulter's change into a redeemable character? Especially her and Lord Asriel's confrontation with Metatron. It was a wasted opportunity.   There is supposedly a great war build up, but who exactly are we fighting here? On one side, there is Lord Asriel and his large army. On the other... The Authority? Oh wait, we don't even know if he exits (and when we do see he exists, he is no more a threat than an infant). Metatron is the enemy, but only because Lord Asriel turns out to admit his plans of destroying Dust was a lie in favor of taking down God instead. But as we learn, angels in this story are just... Wimpy. These are thousand year old beings, why then are they so easily defeated? There is a great battle near the end, but you never hear of the outcome. Who is the new Authority? Is there a new Authority? What purpose do the angels now have? Pullman simply forgets it ever happened.  The only reason I'm giving this book 3 stars instead of 2 is the significance of Lyra, Will and Mary Malone. While I found myself virtually skipping the parts of Mary learning about the Mulefa, I did feel that the idea of Dust as sentient knowledge inside giant seedpods to be very interesting. The Amber Spyglass allows her to study and understand this, but this is largely info dumped dialogue exchange (info dump dialogue and idiot lectures is a commonality in this entire series by the way) and spoon fed to us in dues ex machina fashion by Serafina Pekkla towards the end. Mary playing the role as the serpent and tempting Lyra with her love for Will and their ultimate decision to stay apart was the most heart wrenching aspect of this book. But what was really sad was Lyra splitting with Pan in the land of the dead.   I wouldn't call this a bad book by any means, but clearly, it was not taken through enough rewriting. My biggest complaint is how dreadfully disjointed it is. As anyone who reads a trilogy as big in scope as this, you want the author to stick that last landing. With a little more attention to cohesion, maybe Philip Pullman would have.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I went to see this movie in theaters, as I never read the book before I saw the movie. I personally just wanted to see what all the hype was about. When I left the theater, there wasn't a dry eye in the theater. Emma Stone is fantastic. The movie is filled with funny moments, sad moments, and touching moments. You won't regret buying this!
B006ANJ4BW|2.0|Was in the mood to watch and action flick, just wanted a descent dude movie, decided to rent it.<br />Yeah this is not a very good movie.<br />Cons:<br />Bad acting(Even for the genre)<br />Not amazing special effects<br />Not that much blood(Its Conan right?)<br />Cheesy<br />Zero depth and imagination on the story<br />Pros:<br />None...(Some might argue it has a few chest shots in it)<br /><br />Overall...This movie to me was a complete waste, aside that I spend only a buck to watch it, my overall thoughts where I just wasted how much of my life watching this movie? Save your time and watch a different action movie. Special effects where sub par same with the gore...its an action movie, we expect little in the way of story so the effects and gore need to be there, but it failed at that to me.<br /><br />Why remake a movie if your are going to do it worse?<br /><br />...just my thoughts.

B000HEWEJO|5.0|A must have for the movie rotation for the holiday season.  We watched this movie 2 or 3 times between Thanksgiving and Christmas, as we put together puzzles and ate homemade candy.  Had to have this to share with my family now that I'm all grown up.    If you've never seen it, it will touch your heart and make you remember that people once were children with lofty ideas that we often let slip away.
B000002UAI|4.0|This is The Beatles weakest album (except for Yellow Submarine which I don't regard as a real album).  It could have been improved dramatically by dumping \\"Mr.Moonlight\\" - their worst ever cover and replacing it with \\"Leave My Kitten Alone\\" a great cover recorded during the same sessions but left unreleased until the Anthology project.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|The wizarding world will be missed a great deal in this household so far as new story lines are obviously only the stuff of the faithful's imaginations. However, having the facility through films of revisiting the world of Harry, Hermione, and Ron with all of the characters with whom they were involved is wonderful. This last installment of the series is all I had hoped for...I recommend it without hesitation or criticism.

B003W5C0VM|5.0|This is the best video of Mick Taylor's guitar genius ever.  Mick Taylor made the Stones during their best years - Let It Bleed - Sticky Fingers - Exile - Goat's Head Soup -  Only Rock 'n Roll.  These are the Stones, nothing since compares.  This movie is the peak of rock and roll guitar.  Keith is the guitar front man, but Taylor provides the magic.  Fitting that he left, it had been achieved. This movie captures the greatest rock and roll music ever.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|A man sees his wife suffer a head injury, and then finds out that she had been unfaithful to him. He then sets out to find out about the man was that had been with his wife, while dealing his difficult children. When complications arise regarding the sale of the family land, due to the wife's affair, the man has an interesting dilemma. That keeps the movie from being simply a crowd-pleasing tear-jerker, and inserts an element of mystery as to how the man will proceed regarding his family's inheritance. This was a realistic look at how a sudden tragedy can impact a family, with some humor sprinkled throughout to keep the audience engaged. This viewer was fully engaged and completely engrossed in the fate of this family. Outstanding performances highlight this one and solidify it as one of the year's top films.
0756404738|2.0|I like to call this series \\"Magic for Accountants\\".  The books are fixated on accounting for every penny that the main character has in his possession, and how much he spends each day, down to the smallest monetary unit.  It is just tiresome.  I get it, he's poor, move on.  There are parts of this book which just gloss over sequences which would have made a better story than the things actually told.  For example, a thousand mile journey with piracy, shipwreck, fights, bandits, etc... explained in one sentence.  Yet, there are tremendous swathes of boring minutiae throughout.  My last complaint is that the main character is absolutely unlikeable.  He is vain, rash, and amoral.  It is hard to get into a story when there are few likable characters.  There is some good to be had.  Woven throughout, there is a good story.  But if I had it to do over, I would not spend my time reading this book.  There are plenty of other good books and authors in this genre.  Check out Brandon Sanderson for an example.
B004LWZW9C|3.0|Another film from Garry Marshall with many stars and several unrelated (and some related) storylines, this time surrounding New Year's Eve. This is a romantic- comedy that actually does contain a little of each, with a bit of depth in a couple of the performances. The stories each differ, and in some way members of the audience may relate to a particular one that somehow is relevant to their experiences. Due to the brevity of the differing plots, there is no strong emotional connection for the viewer with any of them, but for light entertainment on a holiday weekend, New Year's Eve is one that you might want to check out.

B0059XTUB8|4.0|An aspiring young filmmaker spent a short time in 1956 on the set of a Laurence Olivier and Marilyn Monroe film as an assistant director. He became close to Marilyn as many men had, and ended up a key figure in the production. Marilyn Monroe was notoriously difficult to work with in Hollywood and that is well-dramatized here. Michelle Williams IS Marilyn Monroe in this one and her performance highlights a realistic look at the difficulties that Marilyn had with trying to be a serious Hollywood actress while dealing with her insecurities and a prescription drug habit. This film was a pleasant surprise and another terrific movie to see during the holiday season.
B00005N6KG|3.0|UPDATE 7/2012:<br />Sadly, i am downgrading from 5 stars to 3.  I just ordered another one this month and the quality of the sound has remarkably declined.  In fact, before I ordered I was surprised I am ordering again this soon but thought maybe I pulled the cord or something.  After receiving this newest one I ordered I am convinced quality has indeed dramatically declined.  Very sad.<br /><br />ORIGINAL POST 12/2011:<br />It's been around that long and yet it is still being made available by Sony.  And people still buy them!  Me included.<br /><br />What I like best about this are:<br /><br />> it is not tight in the head, you almost don't feel you have one on your head. it's very flexible, too.  compare to some headphones which sit like tight headbands on the head which can almost give you headache<br /><br />> i sit in a cube at work so  when at work, i actually put this on facing the other way around (ie, left bud is on right side of face) and don't actually put the buds inside my ear.  i have the earbuds sit just below my temples, with the sound blasting towards my ear.  this way, i hear my music AND also hear noise around me, especially when someone comes over to talk to me.<br /><br />on the other hand, when i put this on the right way at just the right volume, i usually don't hear it when someone comes over or when my cube neighbor is talking loudly again (unless of course i put my volume very low).  so if this is what you want, yes, it can definitely block out other noise<br /><br />> i am very satisfied with the sound.  i have never bought those really expensive headsets so i can't really say how good this one compares, though if it matters i have bose in the house so perhaps you can say i have some exposure to good enough quality sound.  but this is definitely better than the free headsets you get.<br /><br />> i estimate one pair lasted me at least 2 years, if not more.  it's so inexpensive i don't really take care of it. also i just leave it lying around in the office as i have no fear of it being stolen.<br /><br />> this is very worth your money
B0034G4OQS|4.0|It is Christmas and Santa's gift delivery is a high-tech operation assisted by the elves. Arthur is his youngest son and is a bit if a misfit helper. After a child is missed during the gift delivery, Arthur sets out to make sure she gets her present. This is a fun movie with excellent animation and very effective 3D. The characters are endearing without pandering too much to the child audience. It also provides children some insight into how Santa is able to deliver gifts to millions of children around the world. The finale has some Christmas magic, and overall, this is a film that both the kids and their parents should enjoy.

B006C45CFG|4.0|I think that if you *want* to watch a movie called \\"Cowboys and Aliens\\", and immediately think when you hear the title, 'that sounds like fun', then you won't be disappointed. It's just a fun, well-crafted movie. Miles above something like  Laserblast [which I thought was conceptually awesome when I was a kid]. Sure, there were some things that didn't quite makes sense, and there were some definite lost opportunities [IMO everyone at the end should have ended up with \\"arm blasters\\", especially Emmet]. Still, it was fun to watch and genuinely engrossing for me. I'm a huge nerd - and fan of Favreau's work, so there you go.<br /><br />Just the fact that you have Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford shooting aliens makes it worth a viewing.

B005974CNA|4.0|This is basically a paraphrasing of a review from my own website...  Well this album has caused the expected scrabble amongst hardcore DT fans, those determined to love it, those determined to hate it and those who approach it with clinical objectivity. The one thing I guess I feel from the album, is that this album was written with for those who are already fans. While it may attract new fans without doubt, it is an album that says to the fans ... Look we acknowledge we are DT, in all of its light and dark musical forms, so not too much metal, sit down, here we are, back with balanced focus....  This, to me, is not Dream Theaters best album, but it is a strong album and shows definite hope for the future of the band. It shows a band playing back to its well balanced strengths. It is not perfect, there are definite flaws I have not touched on yet. The production is the best I have heard in years from this band. The instruments are all there and well balanced. The bass and keyboards really stand out as different from the last couple of albums. I give special kudos to Jordan Rudess, John Myung and James Labrie whom all sound much more natural and inclusive on this album. Obviously the drum production has, not suffered, ut been placed back a little in the mix for all this and I applaud that. The one area that I am not sure about is the guitars. While the tone on the leads u=is exceptional there is a little something, and this is a niggle rather than a criticism, it is almost like the note attack is not as crisp as usual, or some of the dynamic is missing and this reduces the colour palette somehow of the guitar. The other thing I guess is this album does not have a genuine song that just demands you listen as much as I'd otherwise expect. That may also be because I am getting used to it still, but normally there'd be a song that draws me in, and it just has not happened yet. Doesn't mean it won't though so I remain positive about that.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|This cover is solid if not the most attractive accessory ...I wanted a solid cover, not a sleeve.  The Fire is much heavier than my first Kindle so I didn't want to have to pull it in and out of a cover.  I would buy this cover again.
B004ZNARH4|4.0|Okay, to start this is only a sort of review. DSOTM is such a well known album that you would already have heard enough to have an idea of whether you would like it or not.  My goal here is really to try and give you an idea of whom I think this boxed set may be suitable for. After all, how many copies of the album do you really want to own unless you are a major fan?  And this is the thing, this release is really only for the most die hard fans. Clocking in at $110AUD it is certainly not for casual listeners.  The Good...  Well, the blu-ray audio. To have this album on SACD was special enough, and for me, the first time I really appreciated the album in the way a lot of fans already did. But the Alan Parson's quadrophonic is something else. It is proof alone that this album was written with a different sense of vision than many others. For those with a blu-ray player, you have the same things but with lower bit rate on a DVD audio. The blu-ray, to me, almost alone makes this worth the price of admission. The live shows and extra tracks are all good, but nothing that would normally justify the price. They are still nice however.  The Not So Good...  Four of the six discs have their cases as part of the box, while the blu ray and extra tracks CD came with a cardboard sleeve. Really? I personally believe that they all should have come in a sleeve/jewel case etc. I don't want to go opening and closing the box every time I want to listen to/watch something that it came with. Seems silly, and something likely to shorten the length of the boxes lifespan.  The Bad...  The gimmicks. The marbles. The scarf. I mean, really?? While the list of questions that they asked people while making the album for the samples that appeared on it makes sense, marbles and a scarf? Really?  Final Thoughts  If you are a major fan of Pink Floyd, like I am, then this is a must just to get what is, at this stage, the best quality release of the music. As an \\"immersion\\" addition, some of the extra content is good. Marbles and a scarf though, really? I would have preferred extra content for that price.  Having complained about the price I will say: There are many boxed sets coming out around this price range (hello Dream Theater!) that are nowhere near as rich in terms of worthwhile content. For this price I *expect* the highest quality release possible (Once upon a time I would have said SACD, but, well, I am resigned to it being a dead format now due to its restrictive controls amongst other reasons). I expect extra tracks etc.   In conclusion, a strong release let down by some questionable gimmicks, but worth the money for the hardcore fan compared to other boxed sets that are seemingly far less value but worth more money.  I desperately wanted to rate this with 5 stars, but in the end can only give it 4 due to the packaging and gimmicks.  The music alone is superb.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|I originally had this on my iPod Touch and was hoping to find something similar for my Fire, only to discover that the exact one was in the app store! It's the same game I know and love. I can play this game for hours without getting bored. Simple yet addictive.
B005HPA2XI|4.0|Initial thoughts  I was looking forward to this album even though I had not been much of a fan of the ban until I head Crack The Skye earlier in 2011. Since then I have also managed to track down Blood Mountain. So it was with a sense of trepidation that I heard about the release of \\"The Hunter\\". I knew I would buy it, but I did not know what I would think of it. Then the pre-release songs were released and while good, were nothing of the level of Crack The Skye. I had no problem with that as often individual tracks will be like that. It is the whole album that I look forward to. So on the first listen I sat there knowing I would not form a whole judgement on the album but rather get an idea on what I would like and what I wouldn't.  And so..  The Good..  This album sees Mastodon get spacier. And when they do, I love it. My favourite tracks are the spaciest. What you get is a band who are happy to write metal with space, with a ton of effects at times, and, most oddly, are not afraid of the G,B,E strings of there guitar. And yes, I mean the high E! Mix this in with the unique production that Mastodon have and yeah, it is a very unique mix and definitely left me wanting more of this style of music. Also, the use of multiple vocal parts is something I highly commend  The Hunter and The Sparrow are easily my two favourite tracks on this album. Both are just superb to my spacey ears. Hell, give me a whole album like this and I'd wear my CD player out. (Arcam, I still get a warranty if this happens? Right? RIGHT? Bueller?!) Stargasm is also worthy of a mention, and Creature Lives as well. Thickening is pretty good, as well, though one which was slow to catch on with me. Black Tongue is not bad as an upbeat more aggressive opener.  The in between...  Well, this is where most of the songs fall, in that 5 to 7 out of 10 area. This is not because they are bad, but possibly just because the quality of the good songs, above, is so damned high. These songs, while having their own unique personality, just don't have as much personality as those above. Curl of the Burl, for instance, is an okay song, but, it just doesn't have the sheer uniqueness and feel of the songs above.  The Bad...  I am happy to say there really is nothing that is hatefully bad. There are songs I skip, but that is just my impatience to get to the good songs.  Production  The production again is uniquely Mastodon. Think heavy in an almost fuzzy way. There are a lot more clean vocals than not, which I consider a good thing. There are more keyboards, which I do not have a problem with (look at my Music that I own page for proof).  The spacier sounding songs are fantastic though, a really good mix of all the instruments. I must say I love being able to hear a bass clearly and without competing with the drums.  Final Thoughts  This is a strong album. Not as strong to my mind as \\"Crack the Skye\\", which to me was a stunning album. It may be partially due to the lack of a concept here, or the feeling that a few of the songs could have had more development, but there is that slight level of difference, to me, that makes this album worthy of repeated listens, but not likely to be as long lasting as an album. The shorter songs on this album work in some places, but may have stunted some tracks of that little bit of development that could have taken it to that next level. Having said all that, these songs *may* work better live for those very same reasons. Oh, and for all the fans who mention commercial because of the clean vocals is my take. They would be more commercial, selling to a known fan base, than to chop and change as they do and continue to potentially alienate their fan base with each new album. This is something I actually commend them for as it is never without risk. While AC/DC can get away with making little changes over many years, I am glad that there are bands willing to be a little different all the time. Now my mini rant is out of the way, I will finish by saying this is a good album, but probably not a 2011 top 10. Which isn't really fair as there have been so many good albums this year, in any other year it may have made it.
B000000HRP|4.0|A few years back I had a fire in my apartment and my CD collection was a melted mess. I managed to pull out about a 100 or of them or so out of the cases and the ones that weren't warped amazingly played. Not having any track listings or anything I started looking online while I listened. These reviews on Amazon were a big help and added to the listening experience. Now I am cleaning out my closet and I found a bunch of CD's from the fire that I haven't played yet. This is one of them and while I play it why not review it.  \\"Nuclear Burn\\": Percy Jones and Phil Collins start the song out and then John Goodsall joins in. Robin Lumley has a small solo but it's mostly Percy and Phil. 5 stars   \\"Euthanasia Waltz\\": Robin plays some great piano and Phil is just great. You can't play fusion without a great drummer and Phil ranks among the best no matter the genre. Nice mellow jazz fusion tune. 4 stars.  \\"Born Ugly\\": The stars of this band are Phil and Percy and once again they prove it. Great piano again by Robin as well. Nice guitar solo towards the end. 4 stars.  \\"Smacks of Euphoric Hysteria\\": Calling this music just jazz fusion doesn't describe. It's not as intense as Cobham or Mahavishnu. They are a more mellow and much more bass and drum dominated. This tune is a good example of how all four of them can solo and keep coming back to the main idea. 5 stars.  \\"Unorthodox Behavior\\": This is a strange song with a tick/tock, tick/tock, beat. Robin and John play off each other against a constant drum and bass beat. Cool song. 5 stars  \\"Running of Three\\": The best one on the album. From start to finish an intense Progressive rock song. Wish it was longer. 5 stars  \\"Touch Wood\\": I don't man to diminish Robin and John's contribution to this album, they are both great musicians and the acoustic guitar in this song is as good it gets. Percy and Phil are just so damn good that it is hard not to give them most of the credit. 4 stars.  Summary: These are 4 great musicians and their sound is like no other. Nothing commercial about this one. I like it and recommend it to prog rock fans more than pure fusion fans. 4 and 1/2 stars.
B005NPLXJ4|4.0|Lou Reed has always been challenging. When The Velvet Underground first burst on the scene , the mass audience could not understand them. Their records were regarded by many as trash. Nearly 50 years later , they are regarded as classic and innovative.  Fast - forward to Lou's solo career. Again , many albums such as \\"Berlin\\" , \\"The Blue Mask\\" , \\"Songs For Dreela\\" , initially dismissed and now regarded as revolutionary,  The same can be said for \\"Lulu\\". At first , the listener is CHALLENGED by \\"what the hell is this ?\\"......It IS a disturbing work....but that is the point.  The subject matter is disturbing so how can the recording be not so ?  I will never be \\"comfortable\\" with this record , but I think that is the point....You are supposed to be put off , ill at ease , and challenged. It is Lou being Lou with one of the best Heavy Metal bands ever.  \\"Lulu\\" is the \\"Metal Machine Music\\" of the future....Check back in 30 years to see what the \\"experts\\" say !God bless Lou Reed
1423140591|5.0|I was already a HUUUUUGE fan of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, but when \\"The Lost Hero\\" came out, I was a little skeptical. I was knocked to the ground by the amazing plot of the  book, and overdosed on checking updates for the next book. With the end of the first book, I knew that this would have to begin, or mostly involve Percy. The title \\"The Son of Neptune\\" was an immediate confirmation, and I was glad to purchase it.<br />  The book arrived in perfect condition, thought the box was a little hard to get open, and it had no layer to protect it from rain or water damage. I immediately began reading, and was just astounded by how well I was still able to relate to Percy even in the slight omniscient third-person narration of the book. Frank and Hazel, at the beginning were a little sketchy. I couldn't tell whether I liked them or not, and my mind was dead set on Percy.<br />  I later found that Frank and Hazel were perfect characters to accompany Percy, the goofiness of Grover, with the intention and wisdom of Annabeth seemed to have both been bestowed onto the two (although its best not to think about it that way later in  the book. >.&lt;). Anyway, the book was a great read and I couldn't have asked for more. Thank you Rick Riordan, you've done it again.

B005TBN3EU|3.0|Yes, it is the EXACT same plot in almost every single way. This film is just another excuse for them, to continue the magic of first Hangover's success. Don't expect it to BLOW your mind with hilarity. But it definitely has its moments. Some very dumb moments too (Useless use of a helicopter, too.) But, I think its worth buying.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This is an amazing movie. I just finished watching it a few minutes ago and my emotions are still reacting to it. After hearing a commentator talk about it, I had almost decided not to watch it, but I'm glad I did. I'm old enough to have lived through the time period covered. What I observed as a small child was only the tip of the iceberg. This movie brought out so much more that I just hadn't noticed or thought about. While the movie itself was done in an entertaining manner, I just have a sick feeling. I don't think I'll ever forget some of the scenes.<br /><br />I recommend the movie, and that's the bottom line.<br /><br />Years ago I got my first job, downtown, when I was 16 years old. The job was too hard for me and after a couple of days I was let go. As I waited for the bus in the department store lounge with a dozen or so other people, I picked up the phone and called my mom. I could only blurt out the words, \\"Mom, I lost my job\\" and just started crying. Nobody else in that room said anything or reacted. A very large black woman jumped out of her chair and just came over and held me while I cried. She kept saying, \\"Oh, you poor sweet little child. You sweet little angel.\\" That woman was the first black person I had ever been close to, and I immediately loved her. She and her family are still in my prayers today, many years later. Now, after watching this movie, I have so many thoughts about what her life was like back then. She was in the same position as the women in this film. She had to know that I, a little white teenaged girl, had so many more job options than she would ever have, but she took the time to comfort me with everything she had to offer, and it was a great blessing to me.<br /><br />I'm going to be thinking about The Help for a long time. It hit me right in the gut! What an amazing movie!
B004SBQAN8|3.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, aside from seeing the previews.  The good points: no swearing, no sex, and no gore (although one scene was questionable).  So, it's family friendly.  The acting was okay, the special effects were good, but the story-line was lacking (I thought).<br /><br />I figured I might be disappointed when the opening credits mentioned \\"the sound track\\".  Maybe some teens are going to go to iTunes and buy the music, but really, I was just looking for an above average sci-fi movie...not a sound track.<br /><br />Some of the bad stuff...<br />#1 For aliens, John and Henri look and act too human.  #2 As for John keeping out of sight, he doesn't bother.  So, it lacks a believable story-line.  #3 If you want to lay low, then don't have a photographer for a girlfriend.  And the whole girlfriend thing seemed a bit rushed...and why would he do it?  It puts her life at risk and they can't stay together anyway...typical teen drama. #4 John and Sam's friendship should have been developed more. #5 How did John and Henri just happen to live in the same house that Sam and his father lived in?  It's far fetched. #6 The bad aliens were way over the top. #7 At the end, when the bully helps John, that just didn't fit.  Again, far fetched.<br /><br />I don't think it's a bad movie, but it isn't the kind of movie that I would watch again.<br /><br />Visit my Amazon wish lists to see my 4-star and 5-star DVDs:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2CNNZ3CSQQJEK/<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2Q448LUUQ70GI/
0393064476|5.0|This is a fascinating account of the impact of Christianity on Western thought and history. We are still digging out from under.
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|I love having all my apps stored in the Amazon app store so downloaded this...very disappointed to find it was an old version and uninstalled my newer one from the regular market.
B0055QYKQO|4.0|Great MB no problems with anything but the ethernet driver.  Make sure to specially install the driver yourself do not auto install all the drivers as i did the first time.  It didn't install it for whatever reason even though it showed as installed.  Did have to set the Voltage to get the RAM to 1600MHZ.
B006C45MRE|4.0|This is a fun movie with a cool premise....basically, aliens are attacking and stealing people in the old west. It falls on a posse of cowboys to try and track the aliens down to recover their loved ones and find out why the aliens are here and doing what they are doing. Daniel Craig makes a great hard-bitten cowboy. He is both a good guy and a hardened criminal, although he is also amnesiac, and wakes to find a strange bracer attached to his wrist. As seen in the commercials, the bracer is a piece of alien technology and a powerful weapon. Harrison Ford plays an ex-Colonel, and is also a hard-a^%. They essentially represent two factions forced to team up to track the aliens. Add Olivia Wilde, who is classically beautiful as always, and a bunch of other recognizable actors, and you end up with a pretty good cast.<br /><br />The story itself has some highs and lows. Some points of the plotline are a little hard to swallow, even with the fantastic nature of the movie. However, the development is paced well, and the fun outweighs the flaws. They even mix in some social messages regarding racism and greed into the equation. The aliens are pretty cool looking and the desert settings are really stunning at times.<br /><br />This was a good movie overall. It isnt very cerebral, but if you enjoy an action film with a little meat to the story, i think you will enjoy this. If you are highly critical of any movie that isnt Shawshank or some such, you should probably stay clear of this one.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B005RAO0GS|3.0|Florence has a haunting voice and sings interesting lyrics. This album picks up exactly where her last one left off. It's almost exactly the same as her last album.
B001GKJ2FC|5.0|I saw this movie at the theatre when it came out initially. I thought the same thing i do now...a really fun, action packed movie with some laughs and some intense moments. The bullet interplay is really cool, and the loom of fate is a great idea for incorporating assassins into a story line. James MacAvoy definitely steals the show, although this is also a good role for Jolie.<br />I bought this blu-ray (among others) on sale (for $8) recently to test out my new 3D/Hi-Def Plasma. This disc really shines on that t.v... The added features on the disc are cool also.<br /><br />Enjoy!
0307959856|2.0|Why bother debating all the fine points between Austen and P.D. James?  After the first ten pages -- if you last that long without nodding off -- such comparisons are mute. The book is a dud. If you can plow along, more power to you. Your chore will be made more dismaying by historical errors. Pity P.D. James and her publishers consider her too important for a sharp-eyed editor.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|The strong-voiced, inimitable Adele took the critics by storm already with her debut \\"19\\", for which she scored a Best Pop Female Vocal Grammy in 2009. This modestly good album prepared nobody for what was to come with \\"21\\". The X-factor contestant put out an offering literally FULL of first-rate songs with catchy hooks, which is an awesome feat in the era when pop stars rarely spend energy on more than a few decent tracks on one album. Including two massive number one smashes, \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" and   Someone Like You\\", \\"21\\" has much more to offer, with trademark Adele qualities particularly on display with flamboyant, energetic \\"Turning Tables\\" and \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\" or deceptively simple \\"Rumour Has It\\". There is no weak song here, any more words would be useless. Pop music can be thankful to Adele for saving its reputation.
B002ZG983M|3.0|Kick... is an entertaining movie I have some issues though with a Little Girl cursing like a sailor(hopefully not the stereotypical one that we know now)and being ultra-violent, I have no qualms with violence and violent movies but not when a Kid is the one,besides that and a horrible performance by Nicholas Cage I enjoyed most of it,except the beginning of course and that it was basically a bunch of dweebs.I have not read nor will Read the material it's based on,I think the re-do the whole superhero thing and make it like this ruins the Superhero Genre,yes the Superhero movie has been done to death sadly,and Hollywood is to blame but this is not the answer,it is different and that can mean good or bad I watched it and was not impressed.
B004LUHQ1G|4.0|Foo Fighters' best moments were more than one, but the 2011 \\"Wasting Light\\" is one large big thing. Nirvana's or grunge-in-general fans may differ in opinions, but anyone who likes good songs and welcomes rock arrangements at least occassionally, should definitely jump for this. Maybe too heavy on \\"White Limo\\" (which could well be omitted from tracklist, as it offers nothing this album is good for), much of the album boasts uncannily great hooks and good singing, as well as not-everyday-witnessed dose of emotions, unusual for this genre - although disguised in menace, like in \\"Rosemary, you're part of me... please pardon me... you ain't gonna change the way you die\\" on Dear Rosemary. The guys sound like real and accomplished artists and if you don't mind your music colored in darker and lightless hues, go for it. Music lovers have probably found out this is one of the year's best.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|This is an awesome concert!, I have been a fan of Adele since his first album, and she have become an amazing artist, that broke barriers of ages and genres. The sound and video edition is great, i would only have one complaint i would like that it has more extra material, but the concert itself is very unique and a very personal one, great concert!
1592402690|5.0|Wow, what a treasure trove of information for us Beatle nerds.I absolutely loved every chapter.What a career choice Geoff made at the age of..ready?...Fifteen.As far as the Beatles personalities i was a bit suprised to find out Ringo was a bit quiet and not really as extroverted as his public persona.I got chill's reading about John playing Strawberry for the group the first time.John later said he didnt like how it came out but i have always thought it was his best song ever, at least its my favorite \\"Lennon\\" song.Its clearly obvious that George felt overwhelmed in his early years trying to get his parts down in the studio but alas, who wouldnt be nervous playing Lennon/McCartney songs.But as Geoff writes, George overcomes and becomes an awesome guitarist,composer,producer and arranger of songs.I enjoyed all of the stories told here about the Beatles and Mr.Emericks studio adventures.Its easy to see he was into really getting the best sound for the Beatles and a lot of new innovation went into bringing out the Beatles magic.Like the music of the Beatles this book is fantastic and i highly reccommend it.Thanks Geoff for the music and the book.Peace!
B004EPZ06G|1.0|This movie  is what it is, a funny movie......SHAME ON AMAZON for allowing Warner Bros. market this movie as having a \\"digital copy\\".  ULTRAVIOLET calls it a digital copy.  IT IS NOT A DIGITAL COPY.  It's a STREAMING copy.  Not the same in my lexicon.  I use streaming all the time.  I do not confuse it with a digital copy.  OTHERWISE a funny movie and very entertaining.  Many times when I buy a movie, the \\"digital copy\\" option is a deciding factor. This is because I can view it on my iPad, or phone as well as TV or computer.  Streaming demands that your device has an unlimited data plan.  I have problems with the Ultraviolet 'streaming' method. If you decide you want to view the movie twice you're out of luck.  As far as I'm concerned, Warner Bros., as well as Amazon.com owes me a digital copy of this movie.
B000002N2Z|5.0|This was the first CD I ever bought and arguably the greatest as well. With Stephen Carpenter's raw, yet catchy riffs and Abe Cunningham's incredibly underrated drumming backing up Chino's diverse vocals, you have an unexplainable combination before you. Chino's ability to switch from primal screams to something you may hear in church has got to be the highlight of Adrenaline. He gets your blood boiling, cools you right down and brings it right back louder than ever. Almost every song on this record is on my iTunes FSU!!! playlist. When you need something to pump you up and make you shake, nothing is better than 'Nosebleed'. Key Tracks - 'Bored', '7 Words' and 'Engine No. 9'.
B000XGDO04|5.0|Ordered this CD for my wife (she asked for it for her birthday) but before I did I found a site that allowed me to play it first. I was pleasantly surprised and was even happier when she asked for one of Adele's other albums...21. So, after playing that album Adele now has TWO new fans. I also must add that Amazon.com made it so easy to order that I will probably pick up more CD's there.
B000006NPY|2.0|Maybe I'm just in love with the older style Smashing Pumpkins, but this wasn't really appealing to me. I know bands change styles and I'm not giving them crap for changing. Many groups change over the years and sometimes for the better. I just don't care for this more electronically and atmospherically oriented sound. It's not so much bad as it is just boring and repetitive. There were some highlights though in 'Tear' and 'Shame'. If you liked 'Tonight, Tonight', you'll love 'Tear'. The same type of melancholy orchestral atmosphere. And I don't really know what to say about 'Shame', it's just one of those songs that I've just loved from the second I heard it. Key Tracks - 'Perfect', 'Tear' and 'Shame'.
B006BXU2WQ|1.0|Where is the hard rock metal band that I have loved since the 90's. Some of the more recent albums have been a bit dissapointing,but this is not metal or hard rock Korn. The electronics techno stuff is crap !!! Please go back to your roots and give us a really good rocking metal album.
B005URRCUY|1.0|Totally commericalized Danger Mouse crap. If you took all the good songs from their last 3 albums you might be able to create their 5th best album but they haven't put anything worth buying since Magic Potion (since they went pop). Junior would rollover in his grave if he heard this stuff. Hopefully they make some money from this and decide to make some music again. If you have been a career listener, then this album is not for you. If you haven't heard anything before Attack and Release then you will probably think this is a good album. To me, this album is tied for their worst work.

B00664AM5C|5.0|This movie is not intended for those seeking the typical commercial weekend entertainment. Instead, it is quite realistic and all of those movie stars acting without make up just contribute to its realism (actually some of them I did not recognize at first, save for their voices). Despite its realism, this is not a documentary (at some point it is close but not as boring) but neither your typical science fiction flick (not much extrapolation from actual science).<br /><br />As a reference, the closest film to Contagion is [[ASIN:B001CT876M Outbreak [Blu-ray]]], but without the unnecessary drama or silly mistakes just to add more thrill, and no magical vaccine is brewed is less than 24 hours.  The entire movie faithfully follows a very plausible scenario, a \\"what if\\" world in which we were to face a new virus pandemic, closely resembling the recent scares with avian and swine flu, but more deadly than the Spaniard flu pandemic of 1918.

0452273331|1.0|I'm always amazed when anybody over the age of Twenty Five seems to think that THE FOUNTAINHEAD is a great book or that Ayn Rand was a serious philosopher. And I have read all of Rand's major works, fiction and non-fiction both, a number of times.<br /><br />Back in my early Twenties I attended a seminar where Her Nibs was speaking. If there is anything that will convince you that Ayn Rand is full of $&!%, it is listening to Rand berate her critics and belittle her supporters in equal measure. I came away from the experience realizing that Rand was an amoral huckster who made millions conning people into thinking she had something profound to say. She was also a woman who apparently sublimated her sex drive into sadistic humiliation. She practically glowed every time she uttered an insult, and they were constant. Her critics she dismissed as meaningless, and her fans she derided as being unable to think for themselves. But beyond a reflexive contrarianism she didn't seem to have much to say, other than to repeat all the stock phrases of Objectivism. In short, she was a very, very boring person to waste my time upon. (Spoken like a true Randian.)<br /><br />And so we come to THE FOUNTAINHEAD, a ponderous tome about a ponderous psychopath who lacks any kind of empathy or compassion. Howard Roark is a machine---albeit a flawless one---and the \\"villains\\" in this book all seem to be made out of banana pudding, a mass of subhumanity dedicated to feeding on each others' slowly necrotizing flesh. And those are the fun parts. Other than that, THE FOUNTAINHEAD just rambles colorlessly on and on like its creator, telling you it knows something you don't know.<br /><br />Objectivism isn't a philosophy, it's a structural framework for the justification of selfishness. Cold hard science has swept away Rand's idea of an objective reality separate from the observer. Her conceptualization of \\"rational self-interest\\" fails to go far enough to blossom into \\"enlightened self-interest,\\" an idea which includes the consideration of others' needs as well as one's own as part of creating one's existence as a complete whole. \\"Individualism\\" and \\"Egoism\\" are poorly developed concepts, suitable for a Piagetian manual on toilet training, but not applicable to the best that the human race can offer. Disagreeing with Rand does not, as she believed, make one an blithering idiot and agreeing with her does not make one a bootlicker.<br /><br />In sum, Rand tragically misunderstood human nature. Human beings such as Christ, Gandhi, Martin Luther King, and others of their ilk, were neither Howard Roark nor banana pudding. They were people whose individuation had progressed so far that they transcended their egos. They were willing to make sacrifices OF THEMSELVES for the benefit of others; Rand simply disbelieves this is truly possible. She just hates people. And so, it certainly isn't possible in THE FOUNTAINHEAD. Rand, a Russian-Jewish refugee emigre from early Soviet Russia, should have known better. She didn't, and that's a clue to her immense self-absorption.<br /><br />The twin tragedies of THE FOUNTAINHEAD as representative of Rand's work are that it could have presented a real philosophy had she ever gotten out of her own way, and that, just because this is simplistic, it is easy for those of little moral acumen to hijack it for their own purposes.<br /><br />Need to read a lengthy book by a Russian author in order to learn how to live a complete life? WAR AND PEACE is a far better choice.e consideration of others' needs as well as one's own as part of creating one's existence as a complete whole. \\"Individualism\\" and \\"Egoism\\" are poorly developed concepts, suitable for a Piagetian manual on toilet training, but not applicable to the best that the human race can offer.

B000001AKM|5.0|OMG!  It would be hard for me to be disappointed with anything from Lionel Ritchie.  I love him!!  Got all 4 CD's of his that I ordered in a timely manner.  I'm very satisfied and continue to be a repeat customer of Amazon.com.  Thanks for great service!
B003L77TZI|5.0|So I recently bought the album and when you open it it smells freaking amazing. The songs are great. The stand out songs on the album is \\"The One That Got Away\\".
B0063GORYU|4.0|it needs better reaction when u put the card on a different card and move it because I have to try it like 50 times. but the rest is pretty good
B005HSG3U6|5.0|After I reading all the reviews, I was hesitant to order it. I took a chance and it is really excellent.
B0026P3G12|4.0|Susan Boyle has a wonderful voice so I could not wait to hear her sing How Great Thou Art and Amazing Grace on this CD.  When it arrived I quickly opened it and began to listen.  She managed to sing all of the verses to Daydream Believer, Cry Me A River and other songs but only managed to sing the refrain to How Great Thou Art and only two verses to Amazing Grace.  With the magnificant voice that she has, it would have been wonderful to hear the complete versions of these two songs.
B001UV4XFG|1.0|I received this and it's not Spanish, it's French! Returned... Description is wrong, thanks NETDEALZ, NOT!!! Garbage not worth my time.
B006KNDV5W|5.0|Anomalies are opening up simultaneously all over the world and Jess is barely able to keep enough teams out to handle them all. James Lester lends a hand in the parking garage (a hilarious bit) while the ARC team takes down creatures and tries to stop Philip from destroying the world. It is a race against time as more and more anomalies open, prehistoric creatures attack and Philip proceeds at any cost to make his vision come true.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is good for what it is. If you want typical solitaire this game is for you. No.ads blocking gameplay. And its fun!
B004EPZ06G|1.0|I loved hangover #1, but the second one was not very impressive. the entire movie was a copy cat of #1 just in a different place. It probably would have been better if they came up with some new ideas, but they just kept with the same ideas, but shot in a different location. This was a waste of film and money.  Would not recommend it to anyone.
B002Q1YDLI|1.0|A  dissapointment. I liked \\" Something borrowed\\", but this was not worth reading.  I hold it for unlikely that at woman who is pregnant with twins, hooks up with her rich, and handsome doctor..... And the end - i guessed it at page 20.  Not worth the time, or money!
B004HX4RT6|1.0|Each time I open a game a white knight is missing.  I cannot play without it.  I'm out $2 for a game I can't play.  I want my knight!
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Brilliant! The storyline got darker as the series progressed. The characters progression through time showed their true acting talents. I can't wait for the extended versions.
B005POK858|5.0|Great game! will be buying the other by same company. Got this one free from Amazon. great deal even if you have to buy.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|The Logitech G13 Gameboard is small but overwhelming. Coming from the Belkin n52te (like others you may see mention in the reviews) the G13 is a broader overall unit compared to the n52te. It boasts 22 main use keys, 2 thumb keys, and a clickable thumbstick/joystick like a console controller. It might take your handle a little while to get used to the broad shape (it did for me as the n52te was very hand fitted while the G13 feels a bit more robust) it'll pay off greatly when yuou realize you're not scrambing for keys of differing functions in a game. The G13 gives you enough key mapping space and with fair muscle memory, you'll know where you placed whatever functions you need per game.  The G13 just like other gameboards allows for profiling so you can setup a key layout for a game and then attach it to a game (or program) .exe that it should auto-load to. You have the ability to map functions, macros and other matters by exploring the Key Profiler software that comes with it. The software is very easy to work with at its most base level and doesn't take long to config a profile as you like. You can also use multiple key layouts under a single profile with the ability to switch between 3 layouts for a single .exe, switched between the \\"M\\" buttons above your \\"G\\" keys (the main keys you map out).  The unit has a small built in LCD screen which can feed you info in varying ways. You can have it pick up certain games (or probably load other files to make it pick up and display data for more games), or use it to check time, computer resource status and other things. While it's not a feature I'm necessarily incredibly wowwed over, it still adds to the overall quality of the unit.  Overall the G13 is solidly built and firm. It doesn't feel flimsy in any way, it has a solid base, a slightly smoothened out wrist padding, and it feels properly ergonomic. It also uses back-lit keys so that is a total plus and in an off note compliments the Logitech Slim Illuminated Keyboard.The only issue I've ever had with the unit was that sometimes it didn't appropriately switch the profiles I associated between .exes or wouldn't read one but this was fixed with a simple restart of the program usually. Overall the G13 has lasted me over a year or so at this point and it shows no signs of major wear. I can't think of playing many games without it and recommend it if you play a lot of FPS, TPS, RPGs.  Games it's served me greatly on: Battlefield Bad Company 2, Call of Duty MW series, Dead Rising 2, Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Dragon Age series, Fallout 3 and New Vegas, Mass Effect series, Resident Evil 5, many more

B002RVZV9K|4.0|No question anyone who likes their rock music via guitar must see this film.  My only bit I wasn't happy with was the pick of Jack White, he lacks really  any deep creative flow with the guitar. He gets a kick playing the most beat  up guitars he can find and even better so a guitar out of tune seems to make  his mind a well of musical constipation. \\"Please\\" this doesn't make sense and the  2 pros take it in stride however you can see they look a little confused as to his  aproach on such an instrument.........To each their own but another pick would have  put a little more flame to the film. I should make it clear Rory Gallagher however  can pick any old junk guitar and make it sing to the heavens but you won't find him  when alive or in the heavens playing it out of tune.   I'm sure a few will rant but I don't care as I play guitar and understand at least  in how it should be aproached in terms of playing it, not with a bunch of food on the  strings.............
B00005JLKN|5.0|I just loved it!  Beginning to end, it was worth watching. There is a bonus feature of famed  FBI profiler John Douglas included, and that was the icing on the cake!
B000LC51TM|5.0|Never heard of this group until a few weeks ago. Looked them up and bought this item. They are great. Even though I don't understand German the music is good enough to listen to and watch it doesn't really matter that much. They put on a great show. I like how they show the crowd and their re-actions to the music and how the crowd is a big part of the show. The band rocks! If you like this band, this is one video you have to get!

B002NEFL8W|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moKXCJNCJJ5SLD]]I really like this battery grip for my Canon EOS 7D and keep it attached almost all of the time.  If you are like me you will want to get a chance to see it before you buy it so I made this short video of a virtual demo of the BG-E7.  I hope that it is helpful to you.<br /><br />CORRECTION:  I made a mistake when I mentioned that the power switch on the battery grip controled the battery power.  I should have said that it turns on and off the use of the grip's buttons and selection dial.  Sorry about that.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Can I give something six stars????<br /><br />How does one review a program like The Big Bang? I'm over 70, and sat down one night when my wife was out, and saw a clip. Then I sat and saw a segment. Then I sat and saw the show. Then I waited for my wife to come home, and we watched that over again. I don't remember what the episode was because we were immediately addicted.<br /><br />We watched 3-5 shows a night with On Demand and it didn't even seem to matter that they were out of order. It's only been six weeks, and we've seen them ALL. We're depressed even though there are a few new episodes coming this year.<br /><br />The characters do develop and have \\"quirks\\" in Season 2 and 3 that didn't exist in Season 1, but it doesn't matter. It's so funny that, once you know the characters, you just sit and prepare to be entertained. And as eccentric as the characters are, they're not \\"weird.\\" I even knew a few of these guys way back in the 50s when I was a zoology major, when I took courses in physics and never understood them though I sat next to people who thought it was too much like kindergarten. The only character I never met in the 50s (or 60s) was a girl like Penny! (With apologies to my wife who was way cuter.)<br /><br />If you want to talk \\"weird\\" it's the fact that we now watch \\"Nova\\" and stuff about string theory and my constant disagreement with the big bang theory (the theory, not the show), and we understand it. Who would have thought that Sheldon and Leonard and Howard and Raj could teach me anything?<br /><br />Not every episode is hilarious, but 80 percent of them require stopping the DVDR and rewinding either to catch our breaths, listen to a line or lines over, or just to take a break from laughing. Even the ancillary characters are gut busters. The writers have outdone themselves, and have seemingly given every character a sufficient number of laugh lines to make the entire seasons almost \\"democratic\\" even though Jim Parsons has the greater share - and deserved the awards he's gotten.<br /><br />The other thing is that it seems that the characters really like and enjoy each other in \\"real life,\\" and I've yet to see personality conflicts even in some of the more private outtakes - which are also hilarious. But unlike the atmosphere on such shows as 2 1/2 Men (which jumped the shark two years after Charlie did in real life), there is a camaraderie among all the characters and it shows through. At least I feel that way.<br /><br />The acting is superb. The whole show could be just \\"looks\\" and I'd laugh. For young actors - especially Kaley who's only 26 now - these are professionals. In reading their bios on Wiki, it would appear that they all have lives outside the show which just rounds out their personalities but, to show their professionalism, they put much of their real personalities aside and BECOME these eccentric, uber-smart, nerdy characters. (So much for my psychoanalysis: I'll leave the rest to Leonard's mother.)<br /><br />Whether you will enjoy this as much as I, well, we'll just have to leave that to Schr&ouml;dinger's cat.<br /><br />My kids (who are in their 40s) and I have ongoing jokes all based on these characters and the plots. They gave me this First Season on DVD. Unlike Seinfeld and Friends, THESE I can watch move than twice, three times if truth be told.<br /><br />If you don't, I'll be unhappy, and then you'll have to sing Soft Kitty to me. (P.S. I said that last week after a particularly negative session with my cable provider's rep when she asked if there was anything else she could do for me. After a moment's pause, she said, \\"You made me spit up on my mic and monitor!)ing is that it seems that the characters really like and enjoy each other in \\"real life,\\" and I've yet to see personality conflicts even in some of the more private outtakes - which are also hilarious.

B006C45CFG|5.0|Don't believe the critics and all the naysayers who say bad things about this movie. Yes, it's a very unconventional movie, and yes, it's pretty far fetched. But, all in all, it's a fantastic idea and great adventure movie, similar in feel the original Indiana Jones movies.   I loved it. It was fun and adventurous and action-packed, and it's a sci-fi action flick set in the old west with a stellar cast. If you go into this movie expecting perfection, you will be disappointed. But, if you watch it with an open mind and the willingness to say \\"That's pretty clever\\", it will prove to be a fun movie for kids 10+ and adults.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Lots of fun! I downloaded this application and have been addicted ever since. Was worth the time it took to download.
B0053YGYO4|2.0|The Rihanna song was the best in the album. This album wasn't recorded well or not mastered or something. Didn't sound like they spent much time on it. Maybe if they recorded all these in a LIVE fashion it would be better.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|You may feel like Martin wrote himself into a corner with the events STILL going on in Meereen. .. but get over it. This book is full of the character development and intrigue fans of the series know and love. The low ratings are not justified. The author is writing the series as he envisions it, and his ability to shock readers and deviate from the expected is what sets him apart. If you want a cookie cutter plot look elsewhere. By the end of this entry the plot lines of the last two books begin to merge and form a strong narrative that will no doubt explode in the next book. We just need to be patient. Dance with Dragons is not the best in the series but is still a solid read.
0385737955|5.0|For anyone who has read and loved the Hunger Games series, this is sort of like that. First of all, it's on a futuristic Earth, and many things have changed for the worse. Second, the characters have to make some huge stands for what is right and sacrifice a few friends along the way.    The Maze Runner was satisfying and I'm not even kidding when I say there is nonstop action, from page one to the very end. When everything seems safe and happy, suddenly some new challenge is presented to the characters. The epilogue is also freaky and ends with a cliffhanger.    I would recommend this to young adult reading levels or teenagers. However, to younger children, it's very gruesome and bloody and might make them sick.
1451627289|1.0|In this book King wandered into two genres he never should have touched: time travel and alternate histories.  Both have been done far better by other authors.  The narrative meanders all over the place - the protagonist never even gets to Texas until page 292, and most of the rest is spent in the small town of Jodie, not Dallas.     King also brought his own prejudices to this book, as he himself notes in the Afterword \\"Some people will protest that I have been excessively hard on the city of Dallas.  I beg to differ...I hold strong opinions on this subject...\\"  King was 15 or 16 at the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis and Kennedy's assassination - perhaps he has forgotten the mood of the entire country during that time.  I lived in Northern Ohio, and the populace there wasn't that keen on Kennedy either (except for some - not all - Catholics).  He was painted as being someone who would bring the end of the world.    King also writes: \\"There weren't many derricks in the area, but when the wind blew from the west, where the Permian Basin is, the twin cities stank of oil and natural gas.\\"  Hello-o-o...the Permian Basin is more than 400 miles from Dallas - molecules of air carrying the scent of anything wouldn't have a chance to last all that distance.    I usually follow the \\"Rule of 100\\" with a book - I give the author 100 pages to draw me into his work.  I used to be a fan of King, so I labored on to p. 523 before I finally became so irritated and bored that I gave up.    A waste of money.
B001VTTRC6|5.0|It is common knowledge that each of us reads a novel from our own unique perspective. Many reviewers have commented on Eastwood's faithfullness to the novel but I have never seen a book put to film seemingly from my own perspective until now. I have never been a believer in \\"channeling\\", but the notion fleeted across my mind when viewing this movie. Perhaps not all credit should go to Mr. Eastwood as whoever cast this movie chose actors that my \\"minds eye\\" seemed to invisage when reading the novel.<br />The actors performed incredibly, the score was excellent, just a tremendous movie to a surreal degree.

B0063IH60K|1.0|This app accesses your phone calls, and has an internet connection.  I can understand the internet connection for ads, since it is free.  But there is no way it needs to access your phone call records.  And the developers don't even mention any reason for it in their documentation/FAQ (at least, no place I found), so it seems very sketchy.  If you're willing to roll the dice with some unknown company having access to your phone call records - keep on playing.
B004ZJZPXY|5.0|I love dark comedies. I love anything British! This movie was the best of both in my opinion. There is a small town attitude that is really funny and subtle at first. I can't rave enough about this movie, but I really wanted to review this edition. This edition is a Blu-ray DVD with digital copy. The only thing that I did not like about it was the fact that you have to go to a website and download the digital copy. This should be included in the description because not all people have a high speed connection. I live out in the boonies and it is impossible to download a file this big. I will have to go into town to find a high speed wifi which is inconvenient. It is much better when companies include the disc on these editions. Another thing that I find unappealing is the fact that the digital copy can go out of date. My copy says that the code May not work after 12-31-2012. I have found that if you buy one of these and the code is out of date then try it anyway. I have had success with codes even after the expiration date, so it is worth a try.<br /><br />This edition has a few bonus features like<br />Outtakes<br />22 Deleted scenes<br />5 Feature commentaries<br />Special effects: Before and After<br />22 Video blogs<br />The Making Off<br />The Fuzz o meter that runs trivia during the movie<br />Storyboards

B000MNP2KI|5.0|In my humble opinion Daniel Craig is the perfect new-incarnation of Bond. Like a streamlined new millennium version of Steve McQueen he brings a harsh grittiness to the role that to me fits the original written works. There are enough reviews on here that hash and rehash the contents of the film but I think this kind of thing generally boils down to personal preference.<br /><br />So, why did *I* like this film? Well, as far as what to expect from Bond, right from the opening scene you *definitely* get the idea that \\"Dorothy, you're NOT in Kansas anymore\\"!!! Without \\"spoiling it\\" I can tell you that Craig as Bond is serious as a heart attack from minute one and has no time to waste with the sometimes silly one liners that have peppered Bond movies of the past. He shows a range and depth of raw yet reigned in emotion unlike ANY of his Bond predecessors. He also gives new meaning to \\"edgy\\" - in a particularly wince-worthy scene you begin to question if he is uncompromisingly hard as nails or more than just a bit crazy.<br /><br />The action sequences are some of the best I have ever seen; better than those of the Bourne series if you're looking for something to compare it to.<br /><br />Since the story/script had the daunting task of being true to THIS film yet still had to tie the ones to follow together, I think it did a great job of connecting the dots.<br /><br />This DVD set includes a second disk which has the \\"making of\\" Casino Royale.<br /><br />The best I can do is say that whether or not you are a fan of the Bond legacy, this is definitely a film worth watching.
0307888681|5.0|Max Brooks is greatly despised by much of the zombiphile community. His Zombie Survival Guide is clearly humor but is literally taken by preppers, who hold it accountable for tactical realities.   This book is a novel. It has a very nice \\"what if\\" premise with a wonderful development of the zombie apocalypse. I greatly enjoyed seeing the differing attitudes and strategies from the various countries around the world. The characters are diverse, coming from all walks of life in all kinds of settings. Max Brooks will never be labeled as a great author. But he is a good storyteller.

B003YCOIFY|5.0|The first time I watched this on t.v., I was simply blown away by the production and amount of time put into this mini series. From the acting, to the attention to detail of the tanks and weapons used by both the Axis and Allied armies. By watching this I have much more understanding of what the soldiers went through. From Normandy to Bastogne. When blu ray first came out I looked through everything that would look very good in stunning high definition. Considering that high definition didn't really come out until after the release of this series, I was skeptical as to how they would make this series pop in high definition. I was blown away by how they did it. This product is by far the best blu ray product I have with The Pacific coming in second. These two series are the defining point of cinematography as well as production value. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is willing to take the time. Not only the high definition part, but also the deep and emotional impact that the series provides the viewer.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I must say, this is the first album Metallica has put out in years that sounds and feels like their old work.  Not their earliest death metal, but that sweet period of awesome Metallica rock between Ride the Lightning and the black album that made them into the sensation they were.  And hopefully will be even more.  Oh, and Amazon got me my disk fast and in perfect condition.  5 stars for the album, 5 stars for Amazon.  Nice xD
0393338827|5.0|The Big Short was a fun read and I felt that I had a much better understanding of what Wall Street was doing that got us into the biggest mess I have ever seen in my lifetime.  This is not my first Michael Lewis book and it surely will not be my last. Now I am going to read his book Liar's Poker.  The biggest surprise for me was what a fun read it was.  Be prepared to get upset when you really see what is going on at many of these Wall Street firms. I think Mr. Lewis's book makes a good arguement for increased regulation in the financial world.  Until that happens I would not feel that I could trust my money in a managed fund.
B005VR9328|5.0|I don't think any CD has haunted me the way Undun has. The concept of the CD paired with the craftsmanship of the lyrics and music, along with the often cryptic and poetic nature of the lyrics has left an impression on me the way no other album has.   I think it is the fact that instead of describing the actual situations their character (Redford, a young street hustler who meets his untimely end) like in other concept albums like Jay-Z's \\"American gangster\\" or Master Ace's \\"Disposable Arts\\" and \\"A Long Hot Summer,\\" they choose to delve into the intimate thoughts, feelings, moods and ponderings of the character as he goes through the situation. It's a totally new and unique approach, one I have not ever seen done before on a rap album. It's fascinating and it sticks with you.  The Roots are simply the best that Hip-Hop has to offer, and have been for a long time.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This seems to be popular when my kindle fire is out of my hands.  Lots of fun and free time for me plus the graphics are very, very nice.
B0015AARJI|4.0|the dual shock wireless controller that i bought works superbly, it ajust as good as the once i have used before. great!
B005HSL626|5.0|My daughter made me get this and it has become a sensation with everybody! I find it enjoyable but hey...I want my kindle fire back. Cannot wait till they get their kindle fires for Christmas we are taking turns!
B006C45CFG|4.0|So it's not Avatar or True Grit, but I enjoyed the entire movie.  I considered it to be both a spoof of Clint Eastwood/spaghetti westerns and alien movies.  No one will win an oscar for this, but if you are a fan of Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford or Olivia Wilde, you will enjoy seeing them in very different roles.  Yes the plot is predictable and there are no life lessons, but the entire concept is unique and creative, and that is to be applauded.
B004GYY714|4.0|I got this and was impress with the large selection although some station's I was unable to obtain, either not supported on kindle fire or not at the time which is okay because the other availability makes up for the ones I cannot get at the moment. Provides past shows and from various places very nice!!!
B006C45MRE|4.0|Would have loved the movie a whole lot more if the streaming was better.  Sound was off from picture and the dubbing was terrible.  I tried everything to get it working at an acceptable rate.  Amazon really needs to work on this or leave it to Netflix as they always did a good job on my computer.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Really this is the only note-taking app you'll ever need. Voice notes are excellent. Looks and works great on Kindle Fire!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|After my great disappointment with &#34;The Dome&#34;, I wasn't too sure about purchasing this book, but I am VERY happy I did! I absolutely could not wait to turn the pages to see how George/Jake got thru everything and was pleased with how it all turned out. This book was a topic of many discussions regarding 'time travel' with family and friends. A lot of what ifs and maybes flying around.....sure had us thinking. Unlike some of Kings recent books, this was like the older books where after just 50 pages or so, you just didn't want to put it down. A great story!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Great app. Easy to use, and the ability to set multiple alarms is great. I use our every day. Thank you
0385534639|5.0|I loved this book, but I do want to say up front for fans of Fantasy fiction (ala Harry Potter, the Inheritance Series, and the adult equivalents of those kinds of series), that this is very different. It does involve magic, and it is very whimsical, but it is more of a romance perhaps than Fantasy fiction as it has been defined in this era. I think this is important because I do think this book isn't for everyone, and when I read some of the negative reviews, I felt like part of the issue was that people were expecting something different based on its classification. It has elements of romance, historical fiction, and yes, fantasy, but doesn't easily fit in any of those fiction categories.<br /><br />What is amazing in this book is the visual whimsy and detail. Set in a circus that only appears at night and is decorated entirely in black and white, 2 young magicians - Celia and Marco - are engaged in a contest of skill that plays out in the amazing attractions they create. The attractions are more works of art than traditional circus acts though - an ice garden, a paper menagerie, a wishing tree, a labryinth that changes with the participants. As the relationship between these two develops and grows, they come to realize they are caught in a much wider web of cause and effect than they ever realized, and that the circus is more than a venue for their contest.<br /><br />The book is set in the late 19th century, and that is really the model of magic used too - spiritualism, tarot, bindings, spells worked with books and objects, physical manipulation - all themes that are found in a lot of occult writings of this period. So it is not magic wands, witches and wizards, elves and hobbits, or werewolves and vampires - the beings that have come to populate the most popular Fantasy fiction out there today. As long as you go in knowing that, I think the magic portrayed here is lovely, because it is largely aesthetic and creative - Celia and Marco create little worlds within worlds. For that reason I found their romance very touching, and I am not usually a romance person, because the main way these two communicate with each other is through their creations.<br /><br />The writing in and of itself is not the most spectacular and lyrical, and I see some reviewers have dinged it based on that. It is good storytelling though, and personally I will always side with that. If you are mostly craving beautiful writing, this is perhaps not for you. But if you like whimsy, romance, visual detail, and magic of a creative sort, you will probably love this book. And if you like historical fiction that will probably add to your enjoyment too, because although I wouldn't classify this as historical fiction, it does portray its 19th century setting very well. Overall, I found this original and compelling.worlds.

B0063IH60K|4.0|Very good game.  I have it on my iPad, my Kindle Fire, and my Android phone.  It needs better statistics on your playing results over time.  It also should be set up to keep the same Vegas running money total on all 3 of my devices.
B0002KZAKS|5.0|I read the reviews, and I didnt find any neg comments, so I ordered and crossed my fingers.  Boyee, was I pleasantly surprised.  VERY sturdy, weighted feel, great sound, and to me, sounds every bit as good as an SM58.  If that's not enough, they throw in a great carrying case and a mic clip.  I used this out live a week after receiving it and loved it.  I'm not an engineer, so I dont know how well it ACTUALLY stacks up in a recording studio, but u cant beat it for the price.  I also ordered the 3 mic (1800S) set so I can compare and will write a review after I try them out.  Only con is no \\"on/off\\" switch, but not a deal breaker for me.
B004LROUNG|2.0|Have always been a fan of Grisham, however on this book I was truly dissapointed.  Could hardly keep my interest to even finish it, thinking that it was going to get better is the ONLY reason I kept reading.
B001HN6922|5.0|My DVD received so quickly I couldn't believe it. It was exactly what I ordered and at a very good price.  Thank you.  I will order from you again.
1401223176|5.0|This is a terrific addition to the dark knight cannon. It is essential for any true batman enthusiast and introduces the best villain introduced in the last 10 years, one that will actually stand the test of time.
B0053JJLLC|5.0|I really do not understand the negative reviews. First & foremost this is a work of fiction. You need to have a bit of imagination & give the author a bit of creative license. There was enough real science to carry the sketchy bits & this book had good pacing with a couple of surprises.   Loved everything written by Crichton & The Hot Zone by Preston. I think Preston did a fabulous job with whatever was already written by Crichton.   This book is Jurassic Park meets Fantastic Voyage with a lot of impossible to believe high tech ideas.   Just start with a sample & see if it's your cup of tea. I finished it in under 36 hours. Lost some sleep but it was worth it.

0521173787|3.0|It's already out of date... there are only 4 tests in it.  There are many other books that are better; this is only good because the tests are 2-years old as of the end of 2011 (as in 2010, the tests were already 6 months old before the books came out) as said by IELTS Examiners themselves.

B002VWNIDG|3.0|Great movie.    On my dvd the audio track does not match up exactly with the video, it made it a little annoying to watch.  It looked to be a new copy in the box.
1614270198|5.0|If you have been on \\"The Journey\\" or really \\"THE PROCESS\\" of change. which as you probably realize by now begins with you.  This may be one of the final 2 books you'll need.  The other book I recommend is \\"Master key System\\" by Charles Haanel.  After dozens and dozens of books read and studied. These are the final 2 books that my girlfriend and I study repeatedly by reading aloud paragraph by paragraph every night. We have discussion sometimes sentence by sentence. Spending anywhere from a half hour to 2 hours a day studying.  Sounds difficult?   Given what people call TV entertainment these days.....believe me.....IT'S A PLEASURE TO STUDY good mind nutrition as an alternative to the mind numbing and dumbing TV offers.
0307463745|3.0|I think this book could be worth to read due to it may help you to stop up and consider the work situation you are in. It is easy to read and in best case you can get some new input into your business. Believe in what you are doing!

B0041KKYBA|5.0|\\"Inside Job\\" is the back-story of how the 2008-and-continuing financial meltdown happened.  It's a back-story that shows the nation at peril and--with just a little projection from the documentary's material--it shows the nation's masters as completely unconcerned about the nation's continuing existence.  Average Americans, the back-story shows, are not just here to pay the bills.  We've here to be sucked dry before the suckers move it on down the road.<br /><br />  \\"Inside Job\\", as you surely know by now, is this year's Oscar-winner for Best Documentary.  It was written, directed, and produced by Charles Ferguson, with lots of help from his perceptive friends.  Audrey Marrs also gets a producer's nod.  The documentary also scored the NYFCC award for the year's Best Non-Fiction Film.  The credentials speak for themselves.<br /><br />  The film's interviews are legion and revolve around the steady and caring narrative by Matt Damon.<br /><br />  Damon's parting shots--as the flying camera pans aound the Statue of Liberty and slowly zooms in on face front--bridge the film's revelations to a seemingly now-remote, future justice:<br /><br />  \\"At enormous cost, we've avoided disaster and are recovering.  But the men and insitutions who caused the crisis are still in power, and that needs to change.  They will tell us that we need them and what they do is too complicated for us to understand.  They will tell us it won't happen again.<br /><br />  \\"They will spend billions fighting reform.<br /><br />  \\"It won't be easy, but some things are worth fighting for.\\"<br /><br />  And cue up the sly lyrics and slow honkey-tonk of \\"Congratulations\\" (MGMT, courtesy of Columbia Records), the music backing the end credits.<br /><br />  It was very easy to watch the \\"Inside Job\\" DVD repeatedly over some days.  It has many threads that propel the viewer through the bog-free story, not the least of which are four engaging pieces of music.  There's the soaring \\"Big Time\\" (Peter Gabriel), the piano-on-overdrive and raging harmonies of \\"Takin' Care of Business\\" (Bachman-Turner Overdrive), the outrageously smooth and edgy \\"New York Groove\\" (Ace Frehley, courtesy of Island Def Jam Music Group), and, of course, the melodic closer, \\"Congratulations\\".<br /><br />  My notes on the musical pieces drove me to run the DVD again, just to hear the music and see again how the filmmakers integrated the music propellers into their story.  Flawless.<br /><br />  But Damon's hobbled parting shots are more serious fare.  For millions of us, the seeming impossibility of bringing the Ponzi-scheming criminals to justice is just unacceptable.<br /><br />  This documentary is a detail-loaded, liar and demagogue over-loaded, fraud-rich envirornment.  Double-talk and gibberish bounds out of the fraudsters' mouths right in front of your eyes.  And a Corporatist Senator has the unmitigated gall to feed a clearly guilty fraudster CEO the sophistry question confirming that everybody did it, implying that nobody could possibly be guilty.  Clearly, this is how Corporatism is done.<br /><br />  The laws broken and unenforced are clearly a long list.  How does a government not enforce such laws when tens of millions of citizens are so deeply harmed?  And--harmed by their own government, by their own for-profit corporations, corporations who owe their existence to the American people's patronage.  This is insult beyond comprehension.  Retribution and justice should be massive.<br /><br />  Our watchwords should be \\"we will never forget, we will never forgive, expect us\\".<br /><br />  Demagogue Corporatist Obama:  \\"A lack of oversight in Washington and on Wall Street is exactly what got us into this mess.\\"  And then his wimpy lip-service to reform goes into the same demagogic nowhere as his administration's unenforcement of the broken laws--and is matched regally by his appointments to high office of many of the fraudsters and engineers of the global crisis.<br /><br />  Why?  Why?The insulting answer, as choked out in the film by the very authoritative Robert Gnaizda, former directror, Greening Institute:  \\"It's a Wall Street government.\\"<br /><br />  Spine-crawling.<br /><br />  Obama reappointed Ben Bernanke to the chairmanship of the Federal Reserve, as though the Federal Reserve Act was not unconstitutional in 1913, as though it and its evil twin, the unadopted and unconstitutional 16th Amendment of 1913, and it's unconstitutional federal income tax on wages, were honorable parts of our society.  The Fed was unconstitutional in 1913, and it and its evil twin are national disgraces, responsible for the illegal, nazified, upward redistribution of the real wealth produced by ordinary Americans.  Wealth stolen by the Corporatists.<br /><br />  The 2008 meltdown, and \\"Inside Job\\", are all about central banking.  Without the Fed, the Corporatists could not have even begun their frauds.  It's the one corruption machine that drives all of the other corruption machines.<br /><br />  Our Constitution's authors were very knowledgable of England's usurious central bank, the Bank of England, established in 1694.  They held it responsible for many of the greivous policies against which the Colonies had rebelled in the 1770s.  They were determined and adamant that no central bank ever be perpetrated on their United States of America.  (See the sources for the debates of the Constitutional Convention, 1787.)<br /><br />  Their provisions for Congress to coin and value debt-free currency are as watertight and bulletproof as 18th Century language-use could provide.  And yes, you can still read them in our Constitution.  You know, Corporatist Bush's GD piece of paper.<br /><br />  Wherever it rears its slimy head, central banking equates with an unconstitutional, illegal, usurious, and currency counterfeiting system.<br /><br />  As laid out in Arron Russo's 2006 documentary, \\"America--Freedom To Fascism\\", it took the aristocracratic European central bankers until 1913 to overwhelm the U.S. Constitutional provisions with the inferior and flatly unconstitutional federal statute law that created the Federal Reserve--which is anything but federal and anything but a reserve.<br /><br />  The Federal Reserve Act was the beginning of the now-98-year run in which everyone connected to the ruling Corporatism pretends that inferior federal statute law is superior to the Constitution's fundamental law.  It's how they get what they want.<br /><br />  And don't think that the Federal Reserve Act happened in a vacuum.  The Reform Era began in 1898 with South Dakota's citizens force-voting direct democracy into the state's constitution.  It was the great voting hope to kick the slats out of corruption wherever it turned up.  The people could by-God make their own laws when necessary, veto any law that they didn't like that had been made by a legislature, and recall the election of any rascal demagogue who lied or thieved too much.  This is \\"full-boat\\" direct democracy--everything the sovereign people need to keep government corruption-minimized.<br /><br />  Why don't you know about it?  Why not, indeed.  The Corporatists have spent a lot of money and violated a lot of laws to keep you ignorant.  If the States had been allowed to test direct democracy for all these years, we'd probably have a Nebraska-legislature-style, unicameral, non-partisan, national Congress and all sorts of other corruption-shedding features of government.<br /><br />  By 1913, tens of millions of average Americans were organized to force direct democracy provisions into their states' constitutions.  There were average-guy heroes all over the place, standing up to the grinding, ever-lying superrich and their ever-lying politician puppets.  A total of 12 states had institutionalized \\"full-boat\\" direct democracy by 1912.  Michigan would make it 13 during 1913.  And the total would be 18 by close of business in 1918's swarm of post-WW1 engineered diversions.(See Thomas E. Cronin, Direct Democracy: The Politics of Initiative, Referendum, and Recall, 1999.)<br /><br />  It made Corporatism's leaders crazy.  Direct democracy could ruin all their plans.  They had to get control of the nation's wealth, and they had to do it fast.  The charge to overturn the Constitution's provisions against a central bank began at a now-famous secret meeting of central banker advocates in 1910--birthing the Jekyll Island monster.  (See G. Edward Griffin, The Creature from Jekyll Island, 4th Ed., 2002.)<br /><br />  To this day, that 1913, inferior-to-the-Constitution, federal statute law that set up the Fed is an unconstitutional anti-law.  Each instance of its use under color of law (daily--hundreds of times?) generates a violation of citizen rights under Title 18, US Code, Section 241, and is a felony conspiracy whose co-conspirators number the entire Federal Reserve hierarchy, every private bank and individual paid by the Fed, every sitting member of Congress, the President, and many of the administration's cabinet officers.  Anyone whose actions or omissions lead to a use of--and anyone who financially benefits from--that anti-law is a guilty co-conspirator.<br /><br />  All by itself, the Federal Reserve Act turns the US Govt into a criminal government, from 1913 to now.  And the Federal Reserve Act is only one in a long list of unconstitutional anti-laws that are used to falsely govern the American people.<br /><br />  We might have needed the \\"Inside Job\\" detailing of the global Ponzi scheme to uncover the horrendous scope of illegality concerning the Fed.  Take away the Fed and no part of the Ponzi scheme is possible--not in the US and not in Iceland.<br /><br />  We undoubtedly needed \\"Inside Job\\" to begin the discussion of the Fed's wide-envelope, anti-law.  Apparently, the revelations in Russo's 2006 AFTF were not motivation enough to move John Q into action.  If the 2008 meltdown's millions of foreclosed homes, its trillions oflost dollars, and its millions of lost jobs at the hands of the toxic-paper-hanging, Ponzi-scheming bankers and traders is not enough motivation, then justice is just flat lost in this nation.<br /><br />  Title 18 USC 241 is one of those federal laws that nobody in the ruling Corporatism wants ordinary Americans to know about.  It was used a few times against the Nixon crooks in the early 1970s (see Frank Mankiewicz, U.S. v. Richard M. Nixon: The Final Crisis, 1975, Appendix), and then it pretty much disappeared from use--and not by accident.<br /><br />  It's certainly one of the laws least likely to be enforced during today's Black Plague of corporate greed and political corruption spewed by our ruling Corporatism.  Every citizen right violated by the superrich and their parasite politicians means more money for the right people.  Getting public money to the right people is class warfare writ large, but the writing and the warfare is seemingly invisible to John Q.<br /><br />  For example, in October 2008--a month ahead of national elections--when about 75 US Senators led by Obama and McCain initiated the $700 Billion Bailout in the Senate, they violated every citizen's right to be governed by law made in accord with the Constitution.<br /><br />  The Constitution inconveniently requires all bills for revenue to be initiated in the House.  (See Constitution, Art. 1, Sec. 7, first sentence:  \\"All bills for revenue shall originate in the house of representatives... .\\")  But the House voted down the $700 Billion Bailout just a couple of days before the big dawgs in the Senate showed them how it's done.  Once that House vote was done, all possibility of a House-origination of the bailout was null and void until re-introduction into the House.<br /><br />  Didn't slow down the Corporatist Senators for a moment.  All they had to do was to lie their institutional butts off, saying that the House had sent them a jabber-%$#!!-wocky-$#@$%-wonker.  They then simply modifiedwhatever the hell it was that the House sent them within Constitutional guidelines and other gibberish.  The House Corporatists couldn't have fallen all over themselves any faster to scoot the Senate version out the door and past the angry but now thoroughly confused people.  Presto-jingo, as fast as Bush could swing the pen, every crooked banker from Wall Street to Fisherman's Wharf had millions or billions of public money to play with.<br /><br />  The American people had another unconstitutional anti-law to misgovern them in their glory, and two of the most infamous Constitutional criminals in recent history could face off the next month to see who would become leader of the free world.  Two hundred million American citizen-traitors swarmed to the polls to give aid and comfort to men whose violation of their oaths to uphold the Constitution had turned them into domestic enemies of the Constitution.  Giving them aid and comfort was flatly treason against the United States of America.<br /><br />  Instead of going to federal prison for up to ten years--as  stipulated in Title 18 USC 241--as a co-conspirator in violating the citizens' rights to be governed by law made in accord with the Constitution, Obama went to the White House.<br /><br />  It's the proverbial barrel of snakes, err, can of worms, well--either one.  Every Senator and every Representative who voted yea on the Senate's bill for the $700 Billion Bailout is guilty of felony conspiracy under Title 18 USC 241.  There's no legislative immunity to save them because the vote itself is a legally-defined felony conspiracy and all immunities are forfeit in a felony.  (See Constitution, Art. 1, Sec. 6, 1st paragraph: \\"...They shall in all cases, except treason, felony, and breach of the peace, be privileged...\\" with bulletproof immunity.)<br /><br />  On conviction, 300 to 400 nationally elected officials will pay fines and go to prison for up to ten years--per Title 18 USC 241.  Then, if some sharp lawyer shows that his/her client died as a result of the violation of his/her rights in that felony conspiracy --not beyond the pale--every co-conspirator becomes guilty of felony murder, upping the ante for every co-conspirator to higher fines, possible life imprisonment, or the death penalty--all per Title 18 USC 241.<br /><br />  No, no--enforcing Title 18 USC 241 will never, ever do.<br /><br />  Well--unless you're a stalwart of the old Latin phrase that means \\"The law is harsh, but it's the law\\" (Dura lex, sed lex).  Or unless you're a stalwart of the one that says \\"Let justice be done, even if the heavens fall\\" (Fiat justitia, rust caelum).<br /><br />  There's nothing new under the sun.  When the Roman Senate bested the unwanted dictator Sulla in a civil war, their leading general, Pompey, was directed to re-write Sulla's decade of anti-republic, unconstitutional laws.  Done.  If we attack our Corporatism's criminalities by making every act of illegitimate pretender Bush's presidencies null and void--which would be absolutely correct under Constitutional law--we're on solid ground.  About a decade of unconstitutional laws to rip out of the legal fabric.  We've been there, done that.<br /><br />  Of course, now that Title 18 USC 241 and its dire implications have been spotlighted by an average American, you can expect the Congress and the President to nullify that sillyness, retro to about 1945.  There'll be no more of this talk of citizen rights violations, thank you very much.<br /><br />  No matter how many times I watch \\"Inside Job\\" for its careful progression of the meltdown's details, Matt Damon's last words of the Introduction, just before the Section 1 rips start, sit out on the mind's horizon, reverbing just beyond distinctness.  Bothersome.  So I wrote out the quote on a 3x5 card which I prop up in front of the monitor whenever I replay the DVD.<br /><br />  \\"This crisis was not an accident.  It was caused by an out-of-control industry.  Since the 1980s, therise of the U.S. financial sector has led to a series of increasingly severe financial crises.  Each crisis has caused more damage, while the industry has made more and more money.\\"<br /><br />  The details of \\"Inside Job\\" have informed me of how that happened.  Like most viewers to whom I speak, I've a knawing fear that corporatism's greed is beyond stopping by anything short of revolution.  To which I have one thing to say:  We can get nothing more in a bloody revolution than we can get in a mostly peaceful revolution, and we'll lose too much in a bloody revolution.<br /><br />  Now, where do we start?  Professor Michael Hudson's web site?  The follow-on analysis of global Corporatism's activities after 2008, done in the spirit of \\"Inside Job\\"?  Little Iceland beats up the global bad guys?  Lead on, McDuff.<br /><br />--spib, 12 Dec 2011.<br /><br />Adendum --<br /><br />I'm a 10th generation American.  I'm authorized to criticize.  My first American immigrant ancestor was 8-g grandfather, Edward Spaulding, who arrived at Jamestown, 1619, as an indentured servant.  He lost two young families there and gave up on Jamestown.  He moved his 3rd young family cross-country and north to Mass Bay Colony by ox-drawn wagon, 1636, where his children married into other of my ancestral families.  I've many immigrant ancestors in 1630s Mass Bay Colony.  8-g grandfather, Major Simon Willard--co-founder of Concord, Mass, and 2nd man in Mass Bay for many years--d.24 Apr 1676, Charlestown, Mass.  His 3rd wife, 8-g grandmother Mary Dunster, b.15 Dec 1630, was the niece of Henry Dunster, 1st President of Harvard.  I've many ordinary American patriot ancestors in the War Of Independence.  5-g grandfather, Jonas Butterfield, b.12 Sep 1742, farmer, marched to the alarm, 19 Apr 1775.  5-g grandfather, John DeWatt Weimer, b.circa 1740, left his wife and 7 small children at the farm to fight with Washington's army.  He was at Valley Forge through the bad winter of 1777-1778 and fought atMonmouth, NJ, June 1778.  The patriots were drawn into the fight by the throwaway propaganda of the superrich called the 'Declaration Of Independence'.  The DOI promised a govt in which ordinary Americans would instruct their legislatures.  Govt could be disbanded if it became destructive of citizen wishes and then re-formed in any way that pleased the citizens.  Instead, the superrich violated the standing USA Constitution to illegally ram in the current Constitution, which gives them many powers of control forever--tyranny, in short.  Ordinary Americans were betrayed by their leaders.  223 years on and the nazified superrich (\\"nazified\\", because they love and demand their own rights and liberties while hating and violating the rights and liberties of ordinary Americans) are still violating whatever law gives them increased financial, social, and political power.  Moreover, the superrich and their political puppets have near-zero-accountability--they own the \\"independent judiciary\\".  Tyranny.  Never forget.  Never forgive.  Monied elites with power?  Never again.  Adapt the Swiss Constitution, modified for American-version direct democracy at all levels of govt.  Require it to be taught in all public schools, from middle school, up.  And--stop voting yourselves to death.  Stop voting into the computer-aided manipulation of political corruption--until justice is done.  Stop voting the monsters into power so that they can help other monsters.  It's time to stop what's wrong.<br /><br />--spib, 04 Apr 2012.

0385738773|5.0|The Death Cure is a brilliant book and on Amazon I was able to see what this book is about and I saw what I would receive in the mail when I ordered it. I received this book at record time and much earlier than the sending deadline. It was in excellent condition with no ruined or missing pages. I received exactly what I wanted.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|Entertaining, slightly juvenile, and kindof hard to follow. Kept my attention but couldn't figure out the future-past deal. Good for watching something without alot of drama. Really liked Nero.
B005JLN9ZI|3.0|I really liked drakes last cd so i wanted to get this. I really only like drake when he raps, hate when he sings  and in most of the songs in this cd hes singing like a woman. If you a rapper rap dont try and be chris brown.
B005YDLJ76|4.0|I love BEYONCE!  This is a great DVD.  Some new clips of her as a child and a few I have seen before.  Great buy for a fan.  Do the routines and get a little exercise too!
B005D0RDIE|5.0|An old friend of mine went to this show. I was not able to make it. Everything Rush does is great so if you haven't bought this yet and are not sure about this band yet. If you are a bass player and you haven't listened or seen Geddy Lee..Get A Move! Alex and Neil are of course excellent too. This one solid unit. My favorite group since I stopped buying KISS albums in the 1970's when I was a kid. For such an intellectual band they have a genuine humility and sense of humour.
B002BJGYTY|2.0|I love Gilmore Girls and season 3 completes my collection, but when I opened the plastic wrap I found the DVD's floating freely inside. They're not damaged, but the plastic that holds them in place is completely broken off from the outside so they will never be able to stay put. I'm pretty disappointed that a new set of DVD's would arrive like this.
B001P06GX4|5.0|My family likes this game so much we bought it for many of our relatives this Christmas.  It has excellent replay value for adults as well as children.  It encourages strategic thinking and develops spatial reasoning.  My husband and I like to play it together.  For children too young (or adults too sleepy) to play the game the tiles are really kind of pretty to look at and fun to use to make shapes and patterns.
B003ZVJFFM|1.0|Far from being a Christmas Classic, This is terror movie that will show small children that if someone does not do as it should please every one, hell is the only option for them. Therefore it teaches children to fear the unknown and slaves them to live in fear and hence weakens their full potential in life.<br />  The story is best suited for medieval times, when people believe in ghosts and witchery. If I should rated this movie for the special effects it would probably get a 4.5 to 5 stars. But the content in it self brings depression to people who still believes in hell and feels far short from the natural love of God. I will suggest to any one that is suffering from depression or any similar situation to avoid this movie at all cost, even if the outcome is somehow positive at the end. Shame on Disney that continues to scare young children, with a nonsense, never ending of evil versus good. Of course there are always those who love a good terror movie or a book that immerses them into a hell of fear. For them this movie is a full 5 stars.
B004VPAXHU|5.0|This is one of the great albums of all time, and one of my personal favorites.  If I had only one CD to take to a desert island, it would probably be this one.  It's mind-boggling to me that it has been out of print for a while.  Buyers should be aware, though, that while this is a new release of Hounds on Kate's Fish People label, everything that I've seen indicates that it is NOT remastered.  My understanding is that the 2011 releases of Sensual World and Red Shoes ARE remastered, but the new releases of Hounds of Love and The Dreaming are NOT.  I have the 2011 remastered Sensual World and it is a significant sonic upgrade over the original CD, and I understand the Red Shoes is similar.  I've heard that Kate didn't like the original sound of these due to the use of early all-digital recording, so I suspect that they got the remaster treatment for that reason.  Dreaming and Hounds were nicely produced in analog, and I can tell you from personal experience that the original CD transfers are pretty true to their vinyl counterparts, so I can only assume that Kate didn't think there was enough to gain by remastering these now.  For well-produced originals, remastering isn't going to make a huge difference in sound.  It's also possible that the original tapes have been compromised by age after 25+ years.   Of course, they DID remaster Hounds in the mid-90s as a special edition for EMI, and I have a treasured copy.  IMO it only sounds marginally better than the original, even on a good hifi system, save some additional high-end which isn't really necessary.  So, the theory that they just didn't see the need to remaster it now seems plausible to me.  If you can find this version anywhere, however, you should definitely pick it up for the bonus tracks alone - I don't know where else you can get \\"Be Kind to My Mistakes\\" and \\"Under the Ivy\\", two essential Kate tracks.  In short, this is an incredible album back in print in a new issue, but it is not remastered.  So, if you don't have it, just get it - it still sounds great.  If you already have a previous CD version, however, don't expect an upgrade in sound quality with this release.  You will get new packaging and a fresh, new CD though!
159562015X|5.0|This is an outstanding book that offers GREAT insight into an individual's personality. New books come with the must-have code in the back. The code allows you to access the 120 question online self-assessment. The results of the \\"quiz\\" will WOW you! They are extremely accurate. It pin-points your top 5 strengths. There are 32 different strengths and it identifies your most prominent 5. The book describes each strength, lists ways to work with someone with that strength, and tips for how to use that strength.  I have used this book in a corporate setting and it is a wonderful tool to use when there are teams or groups involved. Knowing the strengths of teammates can greatly help people recognize how to work with someone (what makes them tick, what will be their greatest annoyance, what is the best way to praise them, etc).   I have also purchased the book/code for several of my family members. It has been an outstanding resource to know my husband, mother-in-laws, sisters, and parents strengths! When I can identify what they are good at it helps my relationship with others. Knowing someones strengths can also teach you how to treat others based on their strengths.  THIS STRENGTH-FINDER TEST IS MORE ACCURATE THAN ANY OTHER PERSONALITY TEST! It does not put people into narrow boxes. It is broad enough to take into account several differences. It would recommend it over the Myers-Briggs, Color Test, Animal Test, or any simple personality test that only has results of 3-5 choices. This has 32 different strengths and it adapts the results to your personal answers. GREAT TOOL!  Some examples of strengths include: Achiever, Adaptability, Analytical, Input, Developer, Maximizer, Learner, Command, Self-Assurance, Harmony, Empathy, Woo, Includer, Positivity, Arranger, Communicator, Competition, Context,Discipline, Deliberative, Focus, Futuristic, Ideation, Consistency, Significance, Restorative, Strategic, Relator, Responsibility, Intellection, and Individuation.   Order thisbook new... get the code... take the assessment... read the book for more info... WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED! :)
B006H06IJO|2.0|Justin Timberlake was mildly entertaining at the beginning but the dialog degenerated and the movie felt forced and not believable.  Liked him a lot more in the Social Network, but that was a compelling story.  This was just boring.
B00005JNS0|5.0|My son had been into anything Cars for quite awhile and he saw the movie and liked it alot so I bought it.Great Amazoner!Fast Shipping too.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've never written a review, but this one deserves it.  This is the best King book I have read, and I have read almost every thing he has written.  The story is so interesting.  I especially enjoyed it because I was born in the 50's, and he captured the atmosphere so well.  I would recommend this to all, not just King fans.
B00003CXMG|1.0|For some reason I could never watch this one while it was in theaters.  Tried to watch it last night on DVD, but could only force myself to sit through the first 50 agonizing minutes.  This movie is bad at all levels.  I am shocked Nancy Wilson was somehow involved in it.  I love old Heart music.  Most annoying things:  Jason Lee's nosejob seems to have been performed by a blind person and Kate Hudson has no upper lip.  I wonder if all the 5-star reviews are just sarcastic.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Sometimes by the third season a show starts to die off or gets boring but not this one! It's just getting started!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Katniss is an unforgettable character, she won my heart from the very begining of the book.  She is both stubborn and carring and definately a fighter.  In this book she takes her sister's place (Prim) in the Hunger Games, basically saving her life, making the ultimate sacrifice.  She changes the history of Panem with her bravery and defiance, I loved this book and would recommend everyone to read it!
B004PIA4BI|5.0|is a good replace , and I think is better than mi old battery, very long lasting, I really recomend
0937381888|5.0|I had hoped that this book would give me the confidence to do this ..The guy obviously knows ALOT..(Maybe he could just edit it to the Beer Making for Dummies crowd.)  It is an incredible resource though, and I forwarded it on to an appreciative talent who thought it was fantastic.
B005FVA63A|5.0|Although the 'Kindergarten' 'baby' version of Achtung Baby is included in other releases besides this spectacular Über type, it's important to point out that it's probably the most important aspect of this 20th Anniversary release.  It's practically, and simply, an alternate version of AB more than the nascent (and 'embryonic' as the great earlier review stated) version the title suggests.  Really makes me wonder how they chose these specific mixes, how much work (if any) was needed, and what else is out there in the AB vaults.  Again, as a previous reviewer pointed out, the 'Salome' outtakes of AB (all 7 CDs of bootleg material from the AB sessions) presents a very intriguing 'behind the scenes' look at just a partial glimpse of the AB sessions and where they were heading.  No wonder the band states that AB is the reason the band are still around (since the strife and disappointment of U2 at the beginning of recording AB, with a potential split of the band, is quite infamous in the U2 community).  Über really is an over-the-top version.  Even The Fly shades don't make it worth the price...but that's not the point.  This Über version got a FAR better release than Joshua Tree even remotely received - that speaks volumes to how U2 et al. view this title.  10,000 copies appears to be the total amount released (and probably close to the amount actually created), ostensibly.  No official word on the actual number assembled.  As of today it's already 'Sold Out' on many retail sites, with eBay copies being sold for far more than can be found to date (I can only imagine what the $ will be in the future when it officially becomes 'sold out').  Box design is apparently from some company in Italy - it's certainly pretty cool.  'From The Sky Down' DVD documentary, the title taken from a quote by Bono in the video, presents a pretty good look into the making of AB, but I still feel it leaves so much out.  Again, I'm convinced there's some amazing material still 'out there', waiting to be released in the future (if only we're so lucky).  Flawed in so many ways (why did U2 management include all the typical 'usual suspects' that even casual fans already have, such as the Sydney ZooTV video), this Über version is quite the package.  Crazily priced, but oh so worth it.
0307593312|1.0|I love character driven novels and was taken by the idea of the fantastical nature of this one.  The reviews that I had read were overwhelmingly positive.  When the book arrived I was even enthralled with how beautiful it was, with its rice paper book jacket.  Then I started reading.  \\"Maybe it just starts slow,\\" I thought, when I read the clumsy, repetious descriptions of the music on the radio and Anomame's clothing as she spent three pages descending a simple ladder.  \\"Maybe he just isn't very good at writing about sex,\\" I thought as I read a painfully horrible lesbian sex scene followed by an even more horrible anonymous sex scene.  \\"Maybe he thinks sex sells,\\" I thought, when it became apparent that the most of the sex in the book was superfluous and bland.  And so on, until I realized, \\"Maybe I'm making too many excuses for a book with this much acclaim.\\"    The characters, on whose shoulders the book rides, are one dimensional, the females in particular.  The plot is driven by manufactured plot devices, for example, an immaculate conception.  There is social commentary on totalitarianism and the need of humans to find meaning in life.  I understand that it is this neo-Orwellian piece of the novel that is driving so much of its praise.  I don't get it.  Orwell did it better.  Hell, Orwell, Atwood, Lowry, Kafka, the list goes on and on, they ALL did it better.  There are dozens of beautiful books about the need of humans to find meaning and the trouble with finding it in a charismatic, dictator.  So, I don't understand the heaping of praise on to 1Q84.    I must confess I have not read Murakami's other work.  Perhaps this is much ado about a great author who the literati believe should be recoganized.  If so, great.  Recognize one of his better books.  But not this one.  It is clumsy, redundant, thin on character development but not saved by plot.  In sum, it is plodding, preacy, and pedantic.  To beat it all, its really friggin' long.  I couldn't wait to put the durn thing down.
0789321211|5.0|Great engagement book for work.  Has wonderful, calm messages that bring you back to the here and now.  Has a week on one page, just enough for those phone messages and some notes on side.<br />Looking forward to the new one every holiday season~
B005V1WZ10|5.0|I have been waiting months for this album and I'm not disappointed.  We've been hearing \\"Get Up\\" since early summertime on the radio and \\"Narcissistic Cannibal\\" debuted in the Atlanta area just a few weeks prior to Korn's live concert at Wild Bills.  This album is one of the hardest I've heard in a while.  The mix of metal and dubstep is something that will just take you to a whole new level of hard-core rock!  I love every song and the 2 extra tracks on the special edition are great.  Buy the special edition for the bonus DVD alone and you've spent well.  This is a fresh and bold move for a band that continues to get better and better with the passing years!  Hats off to Jonathan Davis and the Guys!!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I have been waiting and waiting for the last movie to come out before I bought any HP DVD's so I would have the boxed set.  So, when the last movie was due to come out on DVD I went on Amazon to see it.  I expected to pay around $100 (a little over $10 per movie seemed fair) but found it for half that.  There has been some comments on here about these not being the extended editions.....what tripe.  They come with bonus scenes, and I am NOT going to wait another year for the extended ones to come out.  I wanted to have a Harry Potter Marathon with my kids, I had already waited several years for the boxed set, and it did not disappoint.  I will probably look in to buying the extended boxed set when they come out...but until then I love these and recomend them to any Harry Potter fan.
B005FITIGO|5.0|With the heavy-hitting cast of Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore, and others, I sure looked forward to this movie, and it did not disappoint!  A tight dramatization on how all of America was screwed over, and yet some people landed on their feet.  Very well written and equally well acted, I would recommend this movie to anyone!
1451627289|1.0|I made it through about 1/3 of the book.  It started out strong but by Jake's 3rd trip back through time, as the story meandered along I realized I wasn't interested enough to stick it out through five years of further meandering just to get to November 1963. I suppose with lots of editing this could have been a good story.  I'm unloading this turkey to the used book store ASAP!!!
B000F8O2OM|4.0|My husband and I followed the entire series from beginning to end, and loved it. We are scifi fans. :) Because I had seen all of the episodes, I had no reason to check the rating. I was watching the pilot while running on my treadmill, and almost fell off when a full on naked chick came on screen! I realize there are people out there who enjoy that kind of thing, but I am not one of them. I was pretty ticked off. Other than that, I love the series.
B005NS0VNU|5.0|The item is exactly as described, perfect condition, perfect quality. I was extremely positively impressed by the delivery: a lot before I expected!! So it was a real surprise for me to receive it so \\"early\\" (just few days after the official release). Thank you Amazon! 10+++
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I absolutely love Harry Potter!  I am on my second viewing of the series and about to start my third viewing of the Deathly Hallows since receiving the set.  What a great price too.  Thanks Amazon :)
B002NPUCIA|4.0|I sat down with some friends and watched this over the weekend, I loved the show a lot of talent here. The only thing we did not like was the mix, A lot of the solos were left in the back ground. That made it a little hard to listen too, the film Quality was superb. But it is still worth watching, It is the only film footage I have seen. And I think by the end of the show it started to get repetitive, I started to get a little board.
B002MW50KO|5.0|After seeing so many polarizing reviews of this album on here, I felt it absolutely necessary to add my .02.  Evidently, either one loves this album (5 stars) or absolutely thinks it's a catastrophe (1 star).  Both camps have their points, yes.  I must address the 1 star folks, though.  Bob Dylan has for over 5 decades now shown deep respect to so many wonderful, disparate genres of music from and within America.  Call it \\"roots music\\" or \\"Americana\\" or whatever, Bob respects everything from gospel to hillbilly bluegrass to jazz.  And by people that long were dead and gone by the time he picked up a harmonica way back when.  Anyone who ever caught Dylans' Theme Time Radio Hour on satellite radio know what I mean.    So it is completely understandable for Dylan to attempt an album of Christmas songs.  Why the hell shouldn't he?  If there's anyone who has license to add to the canon of Christmas music, it's Bob.    Christmas In The Heart is a compilation of some very popular Christmas tunes and some pretty obscure ones, each one interpreted by Dylan and an incredibly talented group of backing musicians and vocalists.  One should not, however, expect to hear Montovanni or Perry Como.  No Kenny G, either.  As has always been the case, only Bob Dylan sounds like Bob Dylan.  Like him or not, he was well into his 60's when he recorded these tracks.  Time does that to *anyones* voice.  Everyone that harps on his \\"phleghm-caked\\" or \\"gravelly, marble-filled\\" vocals really should show some respect.  He's an artist.  He can try new things with old songs.  Why not?    The set list is diverse and sweet.  \\"Do You Hear What I Hear?\\", \\"The Christmas Song\\" and \\"O Come All Ye Faithful\\" (with a verse in Latin) mix beautifully with \\"The Christmas Blues\\", \\"Christmas Island\\" and what might be the finest cover song ever recorded--\\"Must Be Santa\\".  Really, when was the last time you heard a good accordion solo?  Priceless.  And that's what this album is to me--priceless.  Bob Dylan takes such care and joy in selecting each song--another example of a tribute from him--that this album is truly endearing.  No, it's not polished.  Yes his voice croaks during \\"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\\".  But that's life, ladies and gentlemen.  Huzzah and kudos to Bob for demonstrating yet again that he is a deep font of musical experience and craft.  Merry Christmas to you, Bob.  Thanks.
B000ENC6XM|5.0|I got the movie on time and everything brand new the problem is I thought it would work in my samsung surround sound HD theater but it didn't. I can't really tell you anything other than I wish I can see how good it looks LOL. You will get your DVD on time though
B004SBQGHS|5.0|No matter how often I play I enjoy this game, and find it's not always easy to get the three stars each time around; or the highest score either. Definitely addicting.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|Very good movie.I would recommend it to any one,young or old.I have all the potter movies & would recommend them all.
B0042JTDXK|3.0|Ever since Josh Groban's first cd I have been listening to him.  I bought this cd awhile back, after seeing the music video for Hide Away. The song was okay, I liked the meaning behind it. I was not too happy that I went and bought the cd, but I don't think I am necessarily going to return it either. I am just going to give Josh a break, he's still the same Josh that makes wonderful music, that we all love.<br /><br />He's basically just trying something new.<br />I have learned from a few voice lessons, and other research that you need, to try several different styles of music.<br /> To successfully find your own unique voice.<br /><br />Maybe, that it possibly what Josh is doing, who knows.<br />Just please cut him some slack and support him.<br /><br />Everyone goes through changes and experimenting, to become uniquely them, whether it is music or something else.<br />I know I am.<br /><br /> Hidden Away, and Higher Window were my favorites.  Hopefully, we can get the best of both worlds classical and contemporary with his next album,<br />.<br />I think it seems cool and sober, but underneath it is very human, and sincere. Like a conversation you would share with someone you really trust, which would feel warm.<br /><br /> I am not a total Josh Groban fan like a Grobanite, no offense to you all that are Grobanites.  I am still a Josh Groban fan none the less.<br />I have not been to one of his concerts either.I missed one when it was in Colorado.  Maybe someday.<br /><br />Hope this helped.<br />Blessings.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|overall the book was fabulous although i though that the book would be totally appropriate for kids ages 6 and up or so, which ment i didnt expect so much romance
B005IGZUTC|5.0|I love this series so much. Lindsey Kelk has created such a fun lovable character with Angela. I can't wait for the next one.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|I got very addicted to this. Works great on my droid2. I look forward to more levels! Keep up the great work.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy was absolutely amazing! I found all three to be riveting and kept me on the edge of my seat and I had alot of trouble putting it down. I am an avid Harry Potter fan and I rank these books right up there. Suzanne Collins has given JK Rowling a run for her money! I would recommend this to anyone EXCEPT the children that it was meant for.  Although a mature 12 year old would be find, some of the means of torture/death etc. that are described in this book would, I think, be distrubing to younger children. But all the same, the best series I've had the pleasure of reading in a long time!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Arrived quickly as advertised. Love having Amazon prime to snag my purchases. Now cannot wait for a few more of my favorites to be available.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I love this set! I'm a new Star Trek fan as of three months ago and am very happy to have this set! I just wish it also came with digital copies for storing on my external drive. Anyway, great movies, in good condition, and nice packaging!
B0064J6OMO|4.0|The plot is ancient, but the movie is very well done and the acting is very good! We have a kid and related to both parts of the story. The movie is very funny, highly recommend!
B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|The entire CD is amazing, and I am so glad I bought it. My best friend and I are 18 years old and Big Time Rush has got to be one of our favorite bands ever. I don't much care for most of the new music coming from Nickelodeon and Disney Channel these days, but BTR is definitely an exception. I went to their concert at the NYS Fair, and I must say they put on a truly amazing show. You can tell they have passion for what they do, and I am truly thankful I decided to give them a try last year :). I think the songs are all very fun to listen to, and the ones that aren't extremely danceable (Invisible, You're Not Alone, Cover Girl) are incredibly sweet, and show that the guys see more in a girl than just their outer beauty. They make me smile every time I listen to this CD, and I just wish more artists could respect the female population like BTR does :).
B0000A98ZP|5.0|My teenage girls just love this classic movie. It was a hit when I was their age. Very good, some language though.
B004P12SSW|5.0|I've heard some harsh reviews on this movie when it first came out, but I was still skeptical on how bad the movie was. Of course, my first instinct won over...It was AMAZING! To shortly summarize without giving anything away... Romantic comedy. There are no complex story plots that need to be followed, just good old-fashioned soul-pounding singing, sexy dancing, and comedic retorts. This type of movie genre is aimed towards an audience who aren't looking for complex plots, betrayals, or soul-crushing despair; In fact, it begets the exact opposite. For those who want good old-fashion singing and dancing from the amazing actors and actresses of this film such as Christina Aguilera and Cher, then go for it.         Christina Aguilera fans, you will not be disappointed. Being a Christina Aquilera fan at the age of 9, I always loved her voice. Her voice is what separated the amateurs from the angelic, heart-wrenching artists such as that of Christina Aguilera. Her singing in this movie will move you, and will have you cheering from the sidelines for her character to achieve her dreams. The main point of this movie was to push their main characters and singers, Christina and Cher, to the front stage and lead the story along the way. This movie wasn't made to incorporate the singing into the story plot; more like the movie and story came together DUE to the singing and dancing.         The movie title \\"Burlesque\\" is actually based on the Victorian Burlesque, in which comedic, dramatic, literary, and musical work come together to be performed in theatres to entertain the masses. This movie \\"Burlesque\\" is based off of the American version of the Victorian burlesque, and originally there was no \\"stripping\\" of any kind performed onstage. However, as the early 1900's came in, a \\"strip-tease\\" of sorts was gradually incorporated in the acts, which then the Burlesque shows became known for. In the beginning, the performers would wear more revealing costumes for their musical numbers, making witty sexual innuendos as well, and then strip. However, this was DIFFERENT from the strip clubs, because the audience were paying to listen and watch the performers sing and dance; the strip tease was an added bonus. Also, burlesque shows were available for parties of both sexes to view the show, not just the men. A dramatic difference from the strip clubs and bordellos back in the day.        What's great about this movie is that the directors incorporate the actual history of the American Burlesque into the movie. They incorporated that history in the movie by (without spoiling anything):     1)Showing pictures of the historical American burlesque performers in actual magazines    2)Some of the characters emphasizing how the burlesque show was NOT a strip joint    3)Kept to the singing and exotic dancing in a clean PG-13 viewing (not much naked parts to worry over)    4)Showed performers that didn't sing, but performed other acts and jokes  So, the run down:   Pros: Christina Aquilera and Cher singing, authentic and correct historical facts of the American burlesque established in the film, comedic jokes, amazing dancers and singers, a small love triangle, and something to wipe away the worries of reality.  Cons: Predictable storyline,...that's about it.  For those who enjoy the American historical fashions, songs, buildings, and facts during the early 20th century, this movie is for you.  Again, for those who just want to watch something musically influenced and fun, and fans of Christina Aguilera and Cher, then by all means, watch away!
B004EPZ0BQ|5.0|I am usually very skeptical about romantic comedies, yet I needed a break from the very dense reading  and writing I had been doing lately for a paper that left me completely exhausted, so I was looking for some effortless, predictable entertainment. Predictable it was, if by that you mean how it ends, but I enjoyed every minute of it. All characters are endearing and the sense of humor, just the kind I like. I could also relate to the story personally as it reminded me of the kind of friendship I have with my husband -OK, we are not THAT good looking, but still :)    They manage to be romantic without falling into cheesy territory.  Totally, totally recommend it.
B000CNESU8|5.0|This was purchased as a gift and she loved it.  One of her favorite movies of all time.  Thanks for selling.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|this keyboard rocks hardcore the text prediction is amazing! the layout is fantastic and it looks great as well. definitely my favorite KB.
0312944926|4.0|Though i havent read any of DB's other novels this one stood out to me. As i am into computers and programming. i was immediately swept up by this book. alot of the reviews made this out to be a lousy read with much inaccuracies. Well first off this is a work of fiction, lets not forget that. Secondly DB is not a crypto nor a computer expert and yes he claims to of had 2 NSA agents help him on this novel but really? as hush hush as the NSA is to begin with who are they and how credible is the info given? so with all that in mind lets turn back to to the story at hand. DF is a real page turner and as a Avid Reader myself this is a must for me. Pleanty of plot twists to keep you on your toes. After about 100 pages into this book its really hard to put it down. And its one of those book where you feel like you are right there with the characters. On the flip side i would of like to see more backstory for the characters and to got to know them more intimately. All in all this is a must read!
0767802624|5.0|I bought this movie for my son.  He loves MIB.  It is a fun and exciting film that both kids and adults alike can enjoy together.  Plus, Ethan LOVED the fact that he could visit MIB headquarters at Universal Studios in Florida.

159420229X|4.0|The title of the book is Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything. In the book, the author does not directly describe or explain the art/science of remembering, rather he just traces his own journey in the world of mnemonics and interviews with memory savants. He is too self-conscious at times, especially when he describes how he is feeling in the midst of the competition while obviously the readers are only interested in the Art and Science of Remembering, not his own personal experiences.  However this book is filled interesting stories and it is a fun read.
0307477479|5.0|One of the best books I have read this year. Deep, thoughtful, complex. Portraits of people of our day. Some awe inducing experimentation in writing.
1586487981|4.0|A recent book by the duo Banerjee & Duflo, it looks into why the poors are poor and what can be done about it.  Curiously, several of the authors' answers revolve around habits, customs, lack of information, (plus corruption, lack of infrastructure, ...).  An interesting book that tells us that \\"trowing money at it\\" is not always the right answer, and that we shall study the way people make choices as carefully as we design plans to improve things.
B001OSIV62|5.0|This true story is pure poetry. This is the best way I can find to describe it. I enjoyed every moment of it. Disclaimer: I love climbing and slacklining.
0783233477|5.0|Death and its emissaries have frequently come to Earth for benign or malignant purposes. I was surprised,  a moment ago, to find that this version had done poorly at the Box Office. Who Would Have Thunk It? By now, a description of the film and hundreds of viewer reviews are on the web page. No need to repeat. My view. With the performance of Anthony Hopkins as a firm foundation, the rest of the cast does quite well in creating an atmosphere appropriate to Love Conquers All in a World where Death Always Triumphs in the End. The actress (whom I have never seen) playing the Loved and Loving Role has one of those expressive faces (and body to go with it) that is suitably appealing, Brad Pitt is a solid suitor and Devil to boot and the family members express the diverse emotions of living with a powerful and not always benign father. The background music makes a considerable contribution to the production.   All in all, I was surprised to find the film to be as long as it was. Time passes rapidly when one is captured by a film. I can commend it to all who think they would find a light and loving treatment of a fearful subject  entertaining. It helps that with DVD one can take a break for a drink or snack whenever one wants. For those who need bursts of excitement in a tight-knit film, probably it is best if you pass right by this one.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|The first time I'd heard of the Pretty Little Liars, I was watching a YouTube video; a makeup tutorial (no laughing please).  And the girl in the video said before she started the tutorial she was \\"so excited she just got the 4th book of the Pretty Little Liars\\" for her Kindle.  And the stated how good the books were.  Now this wasn't coming for a little teenie bopper, this is from a makeup artist adult.  So of course being a book nerd I had to look it up.  I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />First thing caught my eye was the rating and then a I read the description.  I was so excited to get this book and read it, it was something so new from what I normaly read.  I ate this book up in 2 sittings.  It's a classic who-did-it type of story that keeps you turning page after page until you get to the end just to find you, you still don't know who killed Ali or is Ali really dead.<br /><br />I had to tell everyone about this book and how good it was, the next night, I bought the 2nd book.  I've now started 4th book in the series, I've bought Season one of the TV show and my husband and myself are hooked.  We can't wait until Season 2 is available to buy, and I'll be getting the next book, and the next book, and the next.  This writer is really good, don't think this is just some cheesy gossipy girl highschool drama teen book.  Oh no!  This is excellent for anyone looking for a page turning mystery that keeps you hooked.<br /><br />I'm eager to try the Lying Game by this same author and am hoping for the same kind of power this series has over me.
B000E33VWW|5.0|Not having seen him perform  previously, I was much taken by Hoffman's  portrayal of Truman Capote. He not only captures the externalities of Capote but  provides a moving portrait of a man divided  within by ambition and  a self-identification with his subject. Whether or not that was Capote, I, certainly, cannot tell. Neither can I tell whether it is a portrait consistent with the source materials upon which the script writers and Hoffman, himself, based their interpretations.  All I can say is that I accepted the portrait as a human being and a human being whose exterior actions seem consistent with the internal character meant to be portrayed. Direction,  cinematography (black and white), supporting cast, Kansas settings, combine to convey authenticity, This is a film well-worth seeing, whatever may be ones views on capital punishment, whatever may be one's own conception of the truth of the \\"confession\\" and on who was using whom, or perhaps, you will find that each was seeking to manipulate the other and was himself being manipulated.
0066620996|4.0|My assignment for school was to choose a book either by typing in Leadership or Group and Team Communication. I chose leadership and Jim Collin's book Good to Great was an option on the list. Being that I am only in college and feeling that this book could be directed to CEOs of companies and people like that was a little intimidating at first. However, I am here for the people like me who are looking to start off on the right foot instead of turning to this book and its ideas after there is already a problem. I found this book to be extremely helpful on the subject of Leadership; it has to be seeing as there is a whole chapter dedicated to it, right? Well it turns out the whole book is subtlety pointed towards leadership. I found only a few parts dedicated to actual CEOs and business owners. The book was easy to follow especially for someone like me whose idea of fun isn't to pick up a good book and just read. There were graphs and charts which are always a nice break from words, and also nice for people who are visual like myself. Being a leader starts with choosing your team wisely, and that's the concept that really stuck out to me in this book. I found it very insightful and I can almost guarantee I'll be looking through my house for it in the near future when I am part of a team/organization.
0439023491|5.0|The middle book of trilogies usually suffers from the injection of excessive background material (in order to eventually make the third book's conclusion plausible) or philosophical musings that wander around, as well as the introduction of more characters to add complexity to the overall tale. In the case of Catching Fire, this tale simply begins where Hunger Games left off and moves forward.<br /><br />Katnis continues to be the focus of an ill-defined, poorly organized rebellion of the Districts against the Capitol, but the threat doesn't seem real. The fact that the Capitol's president, Snow, is concerned is an important clue to the eventual climax, but that's for another book. Katnis also continues to be naively unaware of the politics surrounding these events which is refreshing. Although when the nature of the Quarter Quell games is revealed, it was disappointing that she couldn't divine the crude contrivance to \\"take her out.\\"<br /><br />Although, a storyline like this can fall into a rut, the Quarter Quell events were actually much more exciting to follow and quite intriguing in design. In addition, there is ample opportunity for dropping hints as to something more sinister and coordinated below the surface that is taking place, even if Katnis is either totally oblivious or misinterprets the signs.<br /><br />By the end, the reader is left with the question of how much more this Joan of Arc can be made to play Job for our enjoyment.

0143038419|1.0|Everyone seemed to rant about the movie. I tried sitting through it but found it too tortuous to bear past the 15-minute mark so I decided to read the book. I am now left more upset at the time I wasted. Gilbert turned out to be a self-absorbed extremely privileged middle-age woman who in search for everything couldn't seem to get past her enormous ego. A complete waste of time, this is when a zero star should be available.
0062011847|1.0|Geez this was painful. I've read all the other Discworld books etc etc but this was easily one of the hardest ones to finish for me. I even managed to read 'I Shall Wear Midnight' and 'Montsrous Regiment' in a couple of days, but this took me nearly a week. To clarify how crappy this reading performance is, I normally can read one of Pratchett's (good) books in less than a day. It's hard to describe entirely what's wrong with it, but mostly it's... Weird. The characters are unpleasant, when I enjoyed reading about them before, and I never once laughed. Great. Well at least I can say I read it.
B004UXUUDA|4.0|The movie goes back and forth between two very different stories that ultimately intersect. One takes place in the past, and the other in the present.<br /><br />Story 1: A journalist begins to research a holocost related event that took place in Paris called V&eacute;l d'Hiver Roundup. As she researches, she learns that her in-laws apartment she and her husband have just inherited originally belonged to a Jewish family that was taken in the Roundup. She finds she's pregnant. She wants the baby and her husband wants her to abort it.<br /><br />Story 2: Sarah, a young girl locks her brother in a hidden closet to protect him from being taken in Roundup. She doesn't realize that she won't be back. We watch her as she realizes he will die, so tries to get back to him to save him.<br /><br />The movie kept me interested. Though the the journalist's story dragged a bit at times, Sarah's story was always captivating.<br /><br />The movie brings an historical event into the light that should not be forgotten. I had never even heard of the V&eacute;l d'Hiver Roundup. In July 1942 the French police willingly participated in rounding up and deporting over thirteen thousand jewish men, women and children to Auschwitz extermination camp. The movie follows Sarah's family as they were taken, and then held for days in a sports arena with thousands of others without toilets, water or food.<br /><br />Of note is that although there was some violence, it was not very graphic. Also a woman commits suicide by jumping to her death.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give 5 stars for this movie was that it didn't pack the emotional punch of other holocost related movies such as The Piano and Schindler's list. However it was still very good and really worth seeing.

B000W91RUG|5.0|This is one of my favorite television shows- it's intelligent humor, with a unique cast of characters. Center stage is Sheldon Cooper, an obsessive-compulsive genius from Texas who is one of the most socially awkward people you will ever see. He doesn't get sarcasm and takes everything literally, and he has a pleasant child-like attitude when it comes to his room, his \\"spot\\" on the couch and then there is his inability to operate a moving vehicle. His few friends often wonder why they stick around, but at heart, Sheldon is polite and needs his social group to keep him from turning into a mad scientist.<br /><br />Among his friends are Raj (who has selective mutism around women), Leonard (the most normal \\"genuis\\" of them all), Howard (a Jewish guy with a Beatles haircut who is obsessed with getting women), and then there is Penny. Penny is introduced as Sheldon and Leonard's neighbor in their apartment complex. Leonard is absolutely smitten with this spunky blonde, while Sheldon is not impressed. Him and Penny make an excellent comic duo.<br /><br />Just remember, there was a writer's strike after/during episode 7, so the writers revamped the show starting with episode 8; Sheldon has many more symptoms of OCD and seems a little more human.<br /><br />If you haven't watched this show yet, give it a shot- it's one of the best comedies on TV!<br /><br />...oh, and as usual, Amazon delivered this as soon as it was in stock, about 2 days after I ordered it, in perfect condition. Yay!

B002BWP49C|5.0|I am a new fan of this saga, and it's been a long time since I was a teenager!  This is entertainment for all ages.  I am like some of the other fans - I caught the first movie on tv by accident.  That was it - I was hooked!  I quickly read all of the books and watched the first three movies.  I couldn't wait for the weeks to pass until Breaking Dawn Part I hit the theaters.  I think this is the best movie yet of the saga!  I am a big fan now of both the books and movies.  Each movie seems to get better and closer to the feeling of the book on which it is based.  Breaking Dawn Part I is a perfect balance of romance, action, and mythology (for the book fans), yet still enjoyable if you haven't read any of the books.  I liked that there were many small details throughout the movie that fans of the books could probably pick out quickly, but could keep readers and nonreaders entertained for numerous viewings noticing more of these details each time.  Of course, I also enjoyed seeing all of the talented and beautiful actors again.  They have grown up with their characters, and they did a great job handling the more mature themes and story lines of this installment of the saga.  I would suggest at least watching the other movies first.  This movie covers a lot of ground, and I think it is even more enjoyable and easier to keep up if you have the background for the characters and previous story lines.  This is one purchase you won't regret!!
B001UV4XHY|2.0|I've been disappointed in all the films since David Yates took over as director. Instead of all the beautiful detail of the earlier films, Mr. Yates seems to prefer substituting swirls and darkness for visible representations. Most of the time I can't tell what's going on. If I were not such a devoted Harry Potter fan, I wouldn't purchase any of the Yates DVDs.

1400069181|4.0|I wore TOMS shoes firstly because they were trendy. I thought my stone-washed classics were hip and fun and thought the idea that the company gives a pair of shoes away was pretty cool. Until I read this book and explored the fruition of TOMS and the work that backed it, I never truly understood and I never believed that his project was something I could aspire to do on my own.  Blake Mycoskie, the founder of the 'retail philanthropy' TOMS Shoes, writes a wonderfully passionate and motivational book to encourage readers to find their niche in life and work on what they truly love while giving back. If it wasn't for his already successful company to inspire you, this book is his way of giving back to the community that helps him give so much already.   This book isn't a revolutionary self-help book but Mycoskie's genuine and passionate approach is encouraging and thoughtful. He provides great wisdom through telling his personal journey- pitfalls and successes. He doesn't describe an unreachable goal but believes in the reader to start their own something that matters. I would recommend this book to anyone- most specifically college students looking for the encouragement to go out and get involved with something that matters.

1451627289|4.0|*slightly spoilerific*<br /><br />Given a chance to go back in time to before president Kennedy was shot, would you go back and try and save him?<br /><br />That's the predicament faced by mild mannered school teacher Jake Epping in 11.22.63 , who discovers that the local diner contains a portal back into 1958 America.<br /><br />Nostalgia<br />----------<br />King has done a wonderful job here in invoking a sense of nostalgia in me for a simpler time.  Which is quite a feat given that he has me pining for a time before I was born.  Perhaps he is aided by the cultural baggage associated with the Kennedy era that Hollywood is fond of exploiting and exporting.<br /><br />A consummate weaver<br />--------------------<br />The strength of this book lies in King's complex layering of character and plot.  On reflection, the consequences of meddling with time should be blatantly obvious to both the reader and the character but it's King's skill and experience that shores up what would probably have fallen apart in the hands of another.<br /><br />Neither Jake nor the reader are given the time to reflect on what meddling with time might do. King applies pressure from the outset - Al the owner of the diner where the portal is located, is dying and the lease can't be renewed. So from the outset there's time pressure.<br /><br />The portal always links to 1958 and while returning through the portal to 1958 effectively erases all changes of previous visits, there's a pressure to get things right first time as the time traveller still ages.<br /><br />Initially this isn't a problem, Jake runs a few \\"test missions\\", altering the lives of people he knows who have had unfortunate life events.  This is done to convince himself that it's possible and to understand the forces he's up against in a past that doesn't want to be changed.<br /><br />But preventing the Kennedy assassination is a five year mission, if he stuffs up Jake can have a \\"do over' but he's a 5 years older, with another 5 years to fight against an obdurate past.<br /><br />Intricate plot details aside it's the characters that really made this novel for me.  So good was King's portrayal of 60's small Town Texas and the characters within, that I didn't care about Kennedy by about half way through the novel.<br /><br />Herein lies another pressure - Jake falls in love with a woman and a town.  Jake and the reader are torn between wanting the life he is living in small town Texas protected and completing his mission to save Kennedy.<br /><br />A tireless romantic<br />--------------------<br />This book rammed home to me how much of a romantic I am.  I didn't like the ending, but it's true to the story.  At a hefty 700+ pages this is a book to pace yourself on, to enjoy the alternate reality that King has created.<br /><br />Not a fan of the Kennedy era?

B004SGWYW4|5.0|I glad I gott a chance to watch the shows before reading any of these! My personal thoughts, I really enjoy the show for the show. When I read the name of this. My thoughs was. It sounded dum. After the first eposode! I was hook!<br /><br />Pros: Basicly just plain enjoyable. How these people going to escape. Who useful who a waist!. There was this one guy I really wish he got beat! Hated him really quick!...dont want to spoil!<br />-Get to see the breaking of the change of command and ect.. but you have to put one and one together.<br />-Its not just one small town thing, the hole world gets shaken up!<br />-Learning about what it is to be human.<br /><br />Con: sure at times answer is simple but then show be boring and there wont be a lot of action. If you watch the show, or read other people reviews you know the anser of what Im talking about.<br />-No nude, which is a plus for me. but hints, so I'm glad the make left it that way.<br />-Im for few things but, what the show getting away with, with under gardments showing off....<br /><br />Time to end this: its a action pack, zombie killing show!. Name of the show stills sucks, becasue the high school thing was like 3 epasode. Rest of the show takes place eles where. I still think they over did it with T&A, just under garments. Thankfully no nude parts. But if the creators thinks that help with the sales. Whatever... Story line simple! How to survied. What impressed me is the people action. Spoil allert: One of my fav parts and sad, is father trying to save himself and his daughter. When he trying to get into a home. He treating to break down the door. Door open and... In the end father tried. Door close leaving him and his daught outside. Ok I got one tear from that. What happen next. Can't tell you. Choices were made. either good/bad. I leave it at that. If you seen the show you know what Im talking about! I enjoy it a lot. Its may not be suitable for girls to watch this... Women on the other hand lol! I dig myself a hole!

Go back to sleep Mr. Taleb and those of you that similarly over write ego driven reviews in favour of this clap trap.
B005KJZDXK|5.0|\\"A Very She & Him Christmas\\" is my first foray into the world of the music of She & Him (AKA, that girl from FOX's \\"New Girl\\" and that other guy).  The tracks are almost a cappella with very little instruments, relying on Zooey's vocals to carry most of the songs, with the occasional (or maybe just one?) song sung solely by M. Ward.<br /><br />The songs are very catchy. I literally cannot get \\"Christmas Day\\" out of my head, and that's okay.  This entire CD is a great alternative to all of the other Christmas CDs out there.  Listening to it, it feels so simple, yet it works.  Zooey's earthy voice really soothes and creates a mellow Christmas mood, without going over the top with the Christmas theme.  On \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\" -- that song about temptation during a wintry night -- they do a twist by having Zooey perform the original male part (the person trying to convince the other to stay) and M. Ward singing the original female part (the person wanting to leave).<br /><br />The only thing bad I can say about the CD is that it's only about 32 minutes long.  I have to keep replaying it once it ends.  Maybe that's why I can't get \\"Christmas Day\\" out of my head?<br /><br />P.S. I also love the cheesy retro cover with its Glamour Shots poses.  Classic.

I hope this is the first of many books by Erin Morgenstern.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|This is a wonderfully funny family film.  There are plenty of jokes and gags for folks of all ages.  And there is nothing inappropriate.  No swearing.  No sexual references.  Nothing to make mom and dad cringe and silently wish that something had been left out of the film.  Frank Azaria did an incredible job playing Gargamel.  He got it spot on and he makes the movie.  This film has become one of my family's favorites.
B000I8ES70|5.0|Resident Evil: Apocalypse is, of course, the second in the (so far) four-part, video-game inspired, film franchise. It picks up where the first film left off, with Alice (Mila Jovovich) waking up in hospital to find that Raccoon City has been taken over by the undead and sealed off by her erstwhile employers (the Umbrella Corporation) Oh noes! What will she do? Well, she'll need to get dressed, for a start.<br /><br />Now, let's be clear. This film (and it's stable-mates) have no pretentions to high art. Neither are they really intended to faithfully reproduce the games from which they developed. The RE film series is no more than a bunch of zombie movies and I think we need to hold on to that thought. There will be plenty of shuffling, slack-jawed, dead-eyed ghouls (but that's enough about Amazon reviewers), gallons of gore and, as the protagonists have access to military-grade weaponry, a far-from-modest body-count. The story-line, believability and acting all take second place to the really important stuff - heads coming off and good-looking heroes/heroines and at least we can take comfort that the director and producer understood that perogative.<br /><br />Indeed, it would be hard to find a better looking heroine than Milla J, who established herself as Alice, zombie dispatcher extrordinaire in RE1. This time 'round she has some superhuman powers which I admit, regardless of my earlier comments, do stretch the imagination somewhat. She sure can ride a motorbike, though. Milla/Alice is ably assisted by Carlos (Oded Fehr) a rugged, handsome SWATesque type fellow and Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) a svelte, sexy police officer type lassie. Good looking indeed - in a pinch, I'd go with Oded, but I'd be thinking of Sienna. Mike Epps also tags along as a Huggy Bear type character, but he is really only there for comic value and to give the cast some (ahem) diversity.<br /><br />Their task is to rescue a sweet little girl, fight off a big bloke in a rubber monster suit (not to mention all those pesky zombies) and flee the city before it is \\"sanitised\\" by the naughty old Umbrella Corporation. Just another day in small town America, then. Really though, this does its job admirably, if you're willing to accept some big plot \\"issues\\". How can an entire city be cut off from the outside world? How can the corporation then nuke it (sorry! spoiler!) and pass it off as a power station accident? How can the Umbrella Corporation achieve such fantastical things but still designs a swipe-lock that can be opened by poking it with a needle and a computer security system that can be hacked by typing in \\"find password\\"? How does Jill manage to keep her bouncy bits from popping out of that boob-tube every five minutes? I think we should be told.<br /><br />Fortunately the visual elements of the film (special effects, zombie makeup, sexy cast, blood, brains and great big bangs) make up where the plotline fails and, if you can achieve a zombie-like level of mental activity (\\"Braaaaaiiiins!\\") you can extract maximum pleasure from this fine example of the cinematic arts.<br /><br />Battleship Potemkin?

1451627289|5.0|11/22/63 is an absolute page turner and reminds us yet again of Stephen King's leap from simple novelist to American literary great. Stripped down, this book is incredibly romantic; a serious book for adults:  \\"For a moment everything was clear, and when that happens you see that the world is barely there at all. Don't we all secretly know this? It's a perfectly balanced mechanism of shouts and echoes pretending to be wheels and cogs, a dreamclock chiming beneath a mystery-glass we call life. Behind it? Below it and around it? ... Men with hammers, men with knives, men with guns. ... A universe of horror and loss surrounding a single lighted stage where mortals dance in defiance of the dark.\\"
B004DTXJ4S|2.0|After a brief visit to Tokyo, with her sister-clones, to dispatch the remnants of the Umbrella Corp and deal with that naughty fellow Wesker, Alice is now searching Alaska for Claire and the refugees. She finds Claire, but there's no trace of the others, nor of the fabled, plague free Arcadia. Her peregrinations take her to Los Angeles where she ties up with some more castaways and she disovers that she didn't do a very good job with Wesker and his evil corporation...<br /><br />And so to the fourth in the series. Resident Evil 3 was showing the strain of an unimaginitive producer and screenwriter and this installment is, I'm afraid, no better. Whereas Extinction was Mad Max 2 with zombies, I suspect that Anderson turned to The Matrix for his inspiration for the large part of Afterlife. So we have Alice in Trinity's skin-tight leather catsuit, Wesker in Neo's Gestapo trenchcoat and shades, lots of bullet-time and falling off high buildings firing pistols and so-on. In fact it's so obvious it's almost embarassing. Once again we are treated to some Grand Canyonesque plot holes: just how far can you fly a Yak 52 on one tank of gas? and how many years did those poor people survive on top of the LA prison complex? By the timeline of the series, they must have been there nearly ten years.<br /><br />Well, I'm not marking the film on internal consistency alone and I honestly do believe that you probably can land a small plane on top of a building if you get the wind direction right (but to take off again? come on!). However, the film just keeps on compounding the crimes: there's the racial, gender and occupational stereotyping of the LA survivors, the astonishingly long odds of Claire meeting her brother Chris in the jail, the ridiculous, clunky, B-movie dialogue and the arrival of a Nemesis type creature who is incredibly difficult to kill right up until the moment he looks like he's going to win. I'm sorry, but any one or two of the many crimes against humanity I could deal with as a necessary evil to keep the film trundling along, but put them all together and you get a sort of unintentional comedy.<br /><br />I think that RE1] and RE2 are great and I gave RE3 a three star rating because I felt some loyalty to the brand, but this one barely deserves a two star rating. I shudder to think what the fifth installment will be like. I don't hold out a lot of hope.sary evil to keep the film trundling along, but put them all together and you get a sort of unintentional comedy.

B001RJJ82O|4.0|Many people didn't like this movie, I'm not sure why. For the year it was made, the special effects are really good. The acting was decent in my opinion. It really could have used more action. The clown played by John Leguizamo was really what kept me watching. I kept wondering why the clown seemed so familiar up until the end when it finally hit me. The twisted sense of humor was great. The armor on Spawn was awesome. The storyline was decent. I really feel like this movie was just missing more action.
0062101897|5.0|This book is great! It contains insanely huge amount of information about the Harry Potter films. Any fan will LOVE this book. The images are of a very high quality. It is a great addition to your HP collection.

159562015X|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the strengthfinder - the test is very helpful to find your strength - even more to support what you know about yourself already to become a stronger person. Also the fact that you are able to review what strength you can improve etc.  Once you got the book there's a code for a free online test. Pretty cool.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Awesome Case. Came in the mail the other day and fits the Iphone 4 and 4s perfectly. Accents the apple symbol perfectly so everyone can see my flashy phone. Seems strong enough where if you like to drop your phone you should be protected, yet it doesn't add extreme bulk like some of those high end $50 cases do. My only gripe is when i received it, the camera hole in the back was not cut out. Nothing a knife couldn't handle though. I would still buy this product again and recommend it to anyone.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|Easy To browsw, buy and track...but there is no Amazon On-Demand Video!<br /><br />Once this app has Prime and Video it will be great!
B001UV4XX8|1.0|The premise of this movie is intriguing, but should have been put into a 1 hour special or something. The story went on and on with scenes that made no sense (like they edited out the part that tied it all together or something!). The final ending was really predictable (part of it anyway)- I feel the director needed to either tie all these scenes together better or cut all the things out that didn't seem to contribute to the storyline. Very disappointed.

B005KAH7QU|1.0|They do not let you fast forward or skip any part of the 24 min of advertizement or undesirable previews that precede this predictable and drawn out movie.  On top of the at the end they tease you with the bonus material but when you try to take a look they tell you that your are a cheap idiot who could only afford to rent the movie and will only earn the right to see the bonus material if you buy the blue ray version.  The best way to keep the industry clean of this low life manipulation is to refuse to watch the trash that they put out that attempts to manipulate us is this unethical fashion......
B001ILFUDC|4.0|This movie is a great tale and cute, good for all ages. Classic movie for everyone to love.I do Recommend it
0307394549|5.0|Martha Stewart does not disappoint with this great cookie cookbook.  As always great recipes but what I really like is that there are photos of every cookie, you can see what each looks like.  This is a must have for the cookie baker.  I enjoy making cookies with my grandchildren and this cookbook has such a variety of types of cookies; light and delicate, soft and chewy, rich and dense, chunky and nutty, crisp and crunchy, crumbly and sandy, cakey and tender.  There are also information and how-to pages.<br /><br />This is a must have for anyone who loves to make cookies.

B0050SYS5A|4.0|After browsing several web sites and researching this item before I purchased it I was very VERY hesitant to purchase it. But as I only have about a 4 1/2ft. space between my TV and my couch I decided to take the risk. the leap of faith I took on this item has not disappointed. The Zoom easily detected me when I went to configure my Kinect. It's as simple as following the instructions included with the Zoom. After reading some of the reviews on here it seems, maybe, some people skipped that step. On the down side this item does not help any when my 3 year old trys to play. It is not able to sense him at all, but I don't see this as to big of a problem. I have my Kinect placed above my TV, about 4 1/2 feet off the ground.  All in all I would recommend this item to people who have limited space to play in.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Even with moving the app to the SD card it takes up too much space. Wish I had known before I updated. Don't have enough available space to keep on my phone.

B005OCFGTO|5.0|This complete edition is just what it needs to be. The movies all lined up in a compact format are great for storage. It's a great way to spend a lazy weekend!
034552554X|4.0|If you like flowers and/or mysteries this book is for you.  It is a coming of age story, from the point of view of a girl abandoned at birth and raised in a very poor foster child program. The story includes the mysteries about her past, and how it for worse or better made her who she is. The writing style and plot flowed smoothly like a flower opening up. I couldn't put it down and finished it in one day.

B004SDEP38|5.0|through this app I am able to create documents, read documents, create pp and excel, and connect with my google docs account (a must for me). therefore, why rate it anything less than five stars?
0790729407|1.0|It is never a good thing when the movie you are watching suddenly stops about 20 minutes or so from the end, as if you accidentally hit the stop button.  The movie 'Michael Collins' just stops at what appears to be a dramic scene, then starts again from the beginning. After playing with the remote control, I decided the it was not me, it was the product. Amazon was good about quickly processing the refund.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Really makes the time go by fast when your playing. I downloaded it so I can have something to do while waiting at the bus stop or doctors etc. Really fun to play. Not very challenging though. The only thing I don't like is the fact it wont let you change the card backs and table to your own photos. yes there is an option there in the personalization, but everytime I go to change it, it ends up changing my phones wallpaper.
0802473156|4.0|\\"The Five Love Languages\\" by Gary Chapman is an excellent starting point for discussion. Readers will respond with, \\"That's me,\\" followed by, \\"Well, not exactly.\\" It is a great book to read quickly, and discuss with a spouse or fiance over coffee. You will know yourself and the one you love more intelligently and more intimately.<br /><br />Fundamentally, there are two key questions, and not necessarily in this order:<br />1) How do I best receive love?<br />2) How does the person I love best receive love?<br /><br />Chapman lays out five major categories and uses anecdotes to explain the finer touches.<br /><br />Like many self-help books, it is long-winded and self-indulgent. This could have been whittled down to an efficient 5,000 words instead of an entire book. Chapman takes a good idea and milks an industry out of it, repackaging and remarketing these same ideas into an entire business.<br /><br />That said, his ideas are solid. In fact, despite the short comings, I still believe it is an important rethinking of love. As we know, love is more than a feeling, but an applied action that thinks about the well-being of the other person. People like myself are lunk-headed and need to see that love is beyond roses and chocolates. Chapman breaks it down. Although he comes at this from a Christian perspective, all readers will appreciate his principles.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"The Love Languages\\" by Gary Chapman.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />anthonytrendl.com
B0000028SR|5.0|I have most of the CDs produced by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band and most have been purchased \\"used\\" from various Amazon sellers.  I needed a spare copy for our vacation home and I wasn't disappointed with the CD being used.  The seller described the condition and it was true to that description.
B004K4AUZW|1.0|The CD was damaged and unable to play.  wish I had purchased new. Never again will I buy a used cd
B0053O89KG|5.0|I have enjoyed watching this television series since it came on the air 4 years ago.  Unfortunately, due to station scheduling, it is on too late to always watch when it airs.....but, now I can the whole season of shows and watch them when I want and as often as I want.  I purchased all my CDs and DVDs used and the quality and condition has never been disappointing.  Great description by the seller and delivery was timely.
B000JO9Y6I|5.0|I read the first book, Darkly Dreaming Dexter, which was amazing, and that prompted me to check out Season 1 from our local library.  It was even better than the book..Michael C. Hall is perfection in this role and every one of the 12 episodes in this first season was riveting.  I am totally hooked and look forward to watching Seasons 2-5 which are available also through our library.  Yes there is some violence, but not really like you see in extreme slasher films. Much of the actual killings are implied with the scene cutting away right at the awful moment so it is not TOO graphic....considering that that main character is a serial killer focused on catching another serial killer throughout the twelve episodes.  If you haven't given Dexter a watch yet, you won't be disappointed. He's really quite likable!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|The sound is excellent! The bass is heavy but not muddy. The mid and high are just great as well.<br />I use Audio S9 to try this headphone and was amazed by its versatility (soundwise).  With different EQ settings, this headphone could easily adjust to many types of music (R&B, Classic, country, dance, and folks).<br />One thing I don't like is the small earpads. My ears(normal size)really hurt after 1 hour of using.....<br />Anyway, if you are looking for a headphone with excellent sound, less than 100 bucks, and last long, you should definitely consider this one.
B005N0C0JQ|5.0|I've been an Oasis fan for a very long time. I was pretty upset when they broke up... though... I kind of thought the break up wouldn't last. Low and behold, it seems to be sticking, as now both Gallagher brothers have their own projects. As much as I miss Oasis, I must admit that both solo projects have been great so far... almost great enough to make me not miss Oasis.<br /><br />Beady Eye's album was very solid! It had a lot of good songs and was overall very enjoyable to listen to. However... there was just something missing from it that prevented the album from being great. Now that Noel Gallagher has released his project, Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds, I have figured out what was missing form Liam's effort: Noel.<br /><br />Though I respect Noel's guitar playing, I would never call him a virtuoso; and though I'm a fan of Noel's voice, I wouldn't say he's the greatest singer in the world... however what Noel really brings to the table is excellent songwriting. His songs made Oasis great, and they make High Flying Birds great.<br /><br />High Flying Birds represents Noel's writing at its finest. Some of the edgier hard rock grit of the Liam-sung songs from Oasis is missing from High Flying Birds, as is for the most part (strangely enough) Noel's signature guitar solos. However, the songs on the album are so well written and well performed that you do not miss the missing elements.<br /><br />Everybody's On The Run is a perfect opener to the album with a long spacy intro that leads to a prominent verse that you can't help but sing along to. If I Had a Gun is a beautiful song with great lyrics and a very catchy chorus. (I Wanna Live In A Dream In My) Record Machine has one of the biggest choruses that Noel has written in a long time, and sounds like it could potentially be a massive single. What A Life is a more upbeat keyboard driven song that sounds like it would've worked well on Dig Out Your Soul. It's a song that makes you want to dance. It's also nice to hear Stop The Clocks make an appearance on an album finally... and the wait was worth it as the song is performed beautifully and ends the album well.<br /><br />I just touched on a few points with some of the songs, but really, every song on the album is great. It's hard to pick out a favorite. On High Flying Birds, Noel does not really branch out or explore many new sounds (though, a couple songs feature horns). However, the songwriting that made Oasis great is in full form. Anyone who enjoyed the music of Oasis, or just enjoys good alternative rock in general should give this album a listen.ance on an album finally... and the wait was worth it as the song is performed beautifully and ends the album well.

B0062KJ1Q6|5.0|Loved watching this movie on my Kindle Fire. The people that caught a glimpse of my K-Fire asked where I could get one.  The best gift I have bought my self. Movies that disappear after 48 hours are Wicked Cool!  Thanks Amazon Prime
B003Y5H574|5.0|the title of this movie pretty much says it all. this movie is funny and sad at the same time. i thought that this movie was great. it was well casted and well written. the cast was awesome. even kevin bacon for beging in for ten minutes. this movie is awesome. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B000TEUSJU|1.0|I watched this movie after my boss said how brutal and gruesome it was. I waited with anticipation for this supposed gem to come in the mail. I watched it last night and I have to say it was the worst waste of time I have ever unfortunately spent my money on. It definitely fits into the \\"soft core porn\\" category but other than that there is nothing to this movie. The first 40 minutes is slightly entertaining but it quickly drops off after that. I have nothing good to say about this movie and advise others to steer clear of this disaster.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After seeing the trailer for the movie coming out in the spring of 2012, I thought I would read the book. It was so good! I couldn't put it down. I'm ready to start the second in the trilogy today! The author makes you feel like you are there. It's a very visual book, but not gorey. I have other friends who told me this was a good book, and they were not wrong!

B000ICM5IK|5.0|I was very happy with songs selected and the overall sound quality of the CD. A must have for all the Rocky fans!
0545265355|5.0|These books were unknown to me until I read a friend's recommendation on Facebook. I am so happy that I listened (and that I ordered all three books together) because I could not stop reading! The books come with a little bit of everything... sci-fi, action/adventure, history, and (my favorite) romance. In addition, the main characters are very unique and easy to fall in love with. Frankly, when I finished the very last page, I was wishing there was a fourth book because I didn't want it to be over. If you are an avid reader and enjoy good entertainment, this trilogy is for you. I promise, you will not be disappointed!
1878424939|5.0|At the time when i was most lost, and had so much anger in my heart. One day my boss comes up to me and say, \\"here you go, i want you to read it!\\" that was it. so i was thinking, i cant say no to my boss... you know his my boss. And i turned the first page and then the next, next thing you know i was half ways through. This is a very easy to read guide, and its this way because everything it say you can relate it to whats going on in your life. A quote that change my life in this book reads as fallows...<br />\\"If you abuse yourself very badly, you can even tolerate someone who beats you up, humiliates you, and treats you like dirt. Why? Because in your belief system you say, \\"I deserve it. this person is doing me a favor by being with me. I'm not worthy of love and respect. I'm not good enough\\"<br /><br />I identified myself with this so strongly! of course i kept reading, im not going to say that the book gets you out of the hole youre in, but it does give you the tools you'll need to fight back!
0062060554|5.0|What a gripping story.  It is the best book I have read in ages.  You MUST read this one, but it won't take long...you won't be able to put it down, I couldn't.
B001TOD92C|5.0|\\"I want to die young in order to be a beautiful corpse\\" is one of the key assertions of some writers of the Romantic literary movement. If Novalis died at the age of 29 and Heinrich Von Kleist at 34, on the contrary Victor Hugo died at the highly respectable age of 83. Some people don't manage to separate their ideal aspirations from real life, some do. Mickey Rourke, in the Wrestler, didn't retire at the peak of his career so he has to suffer now the ever extending gap betwen his glorious past and the man he has become. The awareness of this situation will change him into the Romantic hero he deserved to be. Masterpiece.
B0017HEX76|1.0|the quality is poor. it lookes like a reproduction of a vhs tape that was recorded by a camcorder.

I am no expert on Mao or Chinese history and have nothing to compare it with, but for entertainment value, this real life horror story cannot be beat.  This has got to be the best political bio I have read in my life.

1589946634|4.0|As has been mentioned by several reviewers the game is extremely difficult to win.  I have only played it solo, but my win/loss percentage seems to be as low as it is for most players.  Also, many have stated the rule book simply doesn't explain the rules very well.  It would have helped a lot if they went thru an example of the initial game play.  I recommend the add on set that includes additional Space Marines, because some of their special abilities are better than those of the Space Marines in the base pack.  For instance, Chaplain Raziel in the addition pack has this as an Attack card - \\"When Chaplain Raziel attacks a swarm in his position, the defending swarm may not attack this turn.\\"  Very powerful card to play.  Another nice Attack card - \\"Instead of attacking with Brother Adron, you may roll a combat die.  Slay up to 3 Genestealers from a single swarm up to this number of positions away (regardless of facing).  If you roll a '0,' there is no effect.\\"  As I recall both of these cards came from the add on pack.  With this game you need all the help you can get.  And, I must say, for those few times that you win it is very rewarding.
B0033AI48Y|5.0|Really happy I watched this movie. Surprised I had not seen it before; or perhaps I forgot. Regardless, it's a must see for me... and a great movie to add to my listing.
1451648537|5.0|Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs is, without doubt, the best-written biography I've ever read.  When I first saw the enormous book, my heart sank:  more than 600 pages?  Normally, I find nonfiction tiresome or sleep-inducing, but not in this case.  This biography entertained me from the first page to the last!  Getting an insight into Jobs' philosophy of life and passion for his work has caused me to rethink my own life and work.   To sum it up:  Steve Jobs, the biography, is a job well done.
B00000JNNY|5.0|I write a lot about women and Etta James has an emotional story. In this classic she displays for us her famous voice in the only way that Etta can do it. I got to see Etta James perform and I recently purchased this CD for my daughter who is a rocker with a different and equally wonderful voice and stage presence. I wanted my rocker child to hear the best so she could be her best no matter what kind of music she sang. I wanted her to know there is excellence and that excellence does not age. Etta fits anywhere. She is on my daughter's song list. Enjoy.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This Spider game is set up similarly to the one you know and love from Windows. Bonuses include: option to change the background, option to have empty slots remain before dealing another set of cards. Wish there were more casino sounds, but does not diminish the fun.

B0066W1AZK|4.0|I like the game and variable difficulty on the kindle fire. I have to agree with a previous review that the game wont save if the app closes. A preset alarm went off from another app and i lost a game i was so close to finishing after several undo redos but other than that I'm very happy with this app. Ads didn't bother me at all.

B003UD7JEE|5.0|DVD set was fantastic, much better than waiting around for the end of season 1 to FINALLY be shown on t.v in Australia. Enjoyed every minute of it, and the deleted scenes were a bonus. However, can't say that the audio commentary did much for me - feel they would have been better off without this as it was just very confused and rambling.  The extra character case files were fun, but basically you should buy this for the episodes not the extras as they are not really that impressive.  For fans of Nikita a great way to enjoy the season again, and a good introduction for anyone who enjoys an action based series, with sex appeal, style and plenty of sexual tension.  Overall very enjoyable and can't wait for season 2.
B004LWZW42|5.0|After seeing the movie 5 times, why not just buy it? We think it is the BEST movie . Ever. (X Men that is)
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Most recent update killed my widget for this app. Please fix ASAP. Other than that I enjoy the app. It's simple to use and I like having my music library handy wherever I may be.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I have recently moved the app from my SD card back to the phone.  There is a limitation to the Android operation system that doesn't allow widgets if it is on your SD card.  After doing this I was able to use the widget once again.  I have upgraded the rating from 3 stars to 4 stars.  I do wish that the player had the ability to let me customize the equalizer to my tastes rather than the preset ones that they have.  Lately I have been creating playlists in Amazon and then using the cubed (3) player to play them as the sound is better through that player.<br />Using Droid Incredible 2.
1611136954|5.0|It took me a long time to get around to reading (or actually listening to) this book because I was swayed by all the negative reviews on it. I was under the impression that it was not going to be as good as the ones before, but to my surprise it WAS as good, if not better. I enjoyed every minute of it just as much as the other three, but what I loved most about this one was the way that it ended. Don't let the negative reviews keep you from reading this fantastic novel, give it a chance and you won't regret it. Can't wait for the next one!
0439023513|4.0|I had to take a day off after I finished reading the series before I could write a review about the 3rd book. Mostly, I can't say that everything about the last book was perfect, however, I can say that this is one of those books that stayed with me and really had me thinking about it.   MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD:  Occasionally, I became \\"lost\\" in the book. What I mean is there are so many details going being thrown at me at one time that I would get confused as to whether Katniss was having a nightmare, or if this was part of her reality. And at some points during the time when they infiltrate the Capitol, it was just confusing as to what was going on. Maybe others were able to follow along better than I was, and maybe this was the intention of the author (war is chaos)  Most the critiques I read are upset that Katniss did not live happily ever after. But do people affected by war ever have a true happy ending? I thought it was rather touching actually that she did end up with Peeta because he brought sunshine to her otherwise dismal outlook on life. I do understand the sadness that comes without a happy ending because we all want the best for the characters we have come to know through the series (ex. I was crushed when Finnick died)  Overall, I would say Mockingjay was worth reading. Just don't expect warm fuzzies at the end.
B0021L8UPS|3.0|This movie is derivative and suffers from a predictable and lacklustre script. The performances are adequate but entirely unmemorable (in fairness to the two adult leads, however, they do play the most stupid parents ever). So it's a testament to the direction that it manages to entertain at all. But it does, thanks to Collet-Serra's tight grip on the material he's been given. Not much else to say really. It's all kind of so-so.
B003O86FMW|4.0|After the ending of Hunger Games I was concerned that the middle book in the trilogy would be a slow paced story that's purpose was to set up the final installment.  While the second book did set up the finale there was no lack excitement, Collins did a great jub setting up the final book while also keeping the reader wanting more.  Can't wait to read the final book!!!
B005HXGE9G|3.0|I saw him live both on the 2010 and 2011 orchestral tours and was very impressed.  Peter Gabriel is one of the most non-nostalgic artists out there, who is never satisfied to rest on his laurels. This is not simply rehashing old songs to cash in on old glory, but a mostly successful reinterpretation.  As other reviewers have noted, last year's &quot;Scratch My Back&quot; did bring out some new things to the songs he covered, but the album was ultimately not very satisfying because (a) the arrangements were a bit tame and samey, and (b) quite frankly a lot of the songs were not on par with Gabriel's songwriting.<br /><br />For both the tours and for this album Gabriel wisely chose the material which would work with the orchestral arrangements.  People who attended the concerts expecting &quot;the hits&quot; were disappointed, I guess.  Not surprisingly the more ethereal, atmospheric songs fared better.  The tracks from &quot;Security&quot; work particularly well, esp. &quot;San Jacinto&quot;.  Other slower tracks like &quot;Mercy Street&quot; and &quot;Red Rain&quot; were also very good.  More rock-oriented tracks like &quot;Intruder&quot; and &quot;Digging in the Dirt&quot; are certainly good, but the rhythm section was a bit weak.  I know there are ways to boost the percussion section in an orchestral setting!  Even if not entirely succesful, the versions of &quot;Intruder&quot; and &quot;Darkness&quot; do bring out interesting aspects.  &quot;Darkness&quot; almost has a &quot;Three Penny Opera&quot; feel to it.<br /><br />I have to make two negative comments.  First of all, the extra CD with instrumental versions really brings nothing to the party.  I listened to it once and probably won't listen to it again.  Never mind, that doesn't detract from the other CD.  the one criticism that I do have about the music, and this is something that bothered me at the concerts, is the weak background vocals.  On both tours his daughter (Melanie?) and one other female vocalist do the backup.  She may be his daughter, but quite frankly she doesn't cut it (and I'm not even comparing her to Kate Bush, which would be unfair).  The insipid, bland background vocals often do detract, most notably on &quot;Intruder&quot;, where a bit of edge is called for.  Still, this does not keep one from enjoying it.<br /><br />Overall this CD definitely fits in any PG fan's collection.  There's no new material here, but the old material is presented in interesting new ways.<br /><br />I did not buy the full-blown version with the booklet and concert DVD, but I can tell you that, as always with Gabriel, the concert was also visually stunning.  Peter Gabriel always expresses his creativity in all aspects of his performance, including stagecraft.  If you missed the concerts you might want the DVD.<br /><br />Now, about that &quot;I/O&quot; album you've been promising us, Peter?do the backup.  She may be his daughter, but quite frankly she doesn't cut it (and I'm not even comparing her to Kate Bush, which would be unfair).  The insipid, bland background vocals often do detract, most notably on &quot;Intruder&quot;, where a bit of edge is called for.

B006GKHE6G|4.0|Graphics are very good for a tablet game. Water physics are top notch. Good number of tracks to unlock. The sense of speed isn't quite as good as some other racers, but you won't be sorry for buying this solid wave racer!
B00005V9HH|4.0|Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne & more star in Bryan Singer's  1995 crime thriller. Five men pull off a successful heist   that brings the attention of an unseen crime figure.   This is a terrific film with a great cast. This special  edition has nice picture and sound plus neat extras.   Get this.
B004U52VPS|5.0|My boyfriend constantly plays angry birds on his phone so when a store who normally sells this for $14.99 had it half off on black Friday I had to buy it.  we have played it a few times and while it takes a little effort to set up and figure out how and where to aim it was a lot of fun.  even our 5 month old son sat and just watched us playing with it and didn't try to eat it.<br /><br />If I had known I could sell them on here for 3 times what I paid for it I would have bought a bunch...but they are significantly cheaper in store.
0439023513|4.0|Mockingjay is a fitting end to a great trilogy. I won't spoil the book for anyone, but I will say that if you are looking for a happy ending wrapped up in a bow, this is not it.<br /><br />Its hard not to be disappointed with the ending of Mockingjay, but the commentary the author manages to make on war, children, and peace trump the desire for a more complete ending. In the final chapters, the series descends into a confusing state where nothing you expected happens and no one makes it out unscathed. Many questions remain unanswered and the truth and the why is beyond the reader's grasp, just as war is often beyond the spectator's grasp. The lasting effect on the children and other characters in the book is tragic, but realistic. The stark violence and atrocities that were sown in these three books are finally harvested at the end and the result is more blood than roses.<br /><br />One of the most interesting and unexpected series I have read, recommended for adults and older teens alike.
0307987647|5.0|This wonderful book is made even better by the talent of the reader. It all comes to life vividly! My two-hour daily commute was made delightful by these CDs (and the ones from the first book, which I also bought on Amazon).  Highly recommended!!
B003Z0BSU8|5.0|Rachmaninov: Piano Concertos Nos. 3 & 4 is a 2010 EMI Records Ltd. recording starring pianist Leif Ove Andsnes. Antonio Pappano leads the London Symphony Orchestra. Julian Haylock has written the music notes. Adsnes plays with passion and you can truly feel his intensity and love for the music. As for the pace of the music it is perfect. Pappano understands the mind of Rachmaninov. A very fine recording indeed. Highly recommended. 5/5.
140120841X|2.0|V if for Vengeance is a weighty tome--not intellectual-ly.  It was over 400 pages long.  Now I know why people buy e-readers.  First, why spell Philip with two lls; its root is philo-which means love of.  Second, the author writes from two points of view--first person (when she's Kinsey) and omniscient author when she's writing from Nora's, or Dante's point of view .  Maybe Grafton ought to hang up the alphabet mysteries.  Oh, and what's with the Japanese gardener, the coyotes, and the huge turkey vultures?  This section doesn't advance the story at all.
B000B63IEI|5.0|Rachmaninov: Piano Concertos Nos. 1 & 2 is a 2005 EMI Records recording starring Norwegian pianist Leif Ove Adsnes. Antonio Pappano leads the Berliner Philharmoniker. Julian Haylock has written the music notes. Being a fellow Scandinavian I am extra proud of Andsnes performance. Truly a magical performance on his behalf. I enjoyed every second. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.

0439023521|5.0|I am a fan of young adult literature, but it is very rare that a book written for young adults is just as intriguing and moving to adults themselves. I could not put this book down and I read it in its entirety in only two days. The Hunger Games touches on issues that are relevant today, and issues that are similar to those found great literature like George Orwell's 1984. Suzanne Collins has created a world where politics are extremely corrupt, fighting to the death is an annual sport as admired and loved by some as the Olympics, and life itself is something you have to survive.   Katniss Everdeen is a strong sixteen year old girl who is determined to save her family. She is stronger and braver than most adults in the story, but at the same time she is extremely relatable to an adolescent reader. Her concerns range from that of love, family, and commitment to friends, but she also has to worry about putting food on the table in order for her family to live. She is a very believable character that any reader would love.  The story line is violent, but not to the point where it would necessarily disturb its readers. One could compare The Hunger Games to the games of the Roman gladiators, with a little bit of Survivor mixed in. There is a lot of psychology found in the story and I myself have used it in a unit and applied advertising and persuasion to the story line. Teachers, you should try to work this into your curriculum because it is relateable, promotes critical thinking, and lends itself nicely to critical analysis and discussion. Your students will definitely be immersed in this novel! Manipulation, death, survival, and a small romance plot make this novel a must read for adolescents and adults alike. You will laugh, you might cry, but you will definitely want to read the two novels that follow!
0446585025|3.0|Let me start by saying I love Ellen Degeneres and usually think she's hilarous....but not in a book.  There were a few times I laughed out loud reading this book...but only a few times in over 200 pages.  Her humor just isn't as funny reading it from a book. I tried to imagine her voice while reading the book and that helped a little.  The book was an easy read though and I easily finished it but not sure I would really recommend it.  I was going to buy this book for my kindle but then decided to check it out from the library due to the mixed reviews.  Now I'm glad I didn't buy it!
0307941515|5.0|This was excellent. Purchased the hardback as well as the Audio CD.As for pricing it was much better than a lot of Online & Stores that carry.
0061537969|5.0|What a terrific story.....I loved the way the author told this story through Enzo the family dog...what he thinks, what he feels....I caught myself throughout this book stopping and looking at my own dogs wondering what they were thinking, what they were feeling, and if they could only talk....how great that would be.......very, very much enjoyed this book.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I bought this title with expectation that what I consider normal Digital Copy was part of the package.  When it got time to use Digital Copy I was unhappy to discover that what I bought was this Ultraviolet version of Digital Copy.  It stinks since I can't use it on my iPad when I am on a airplane or away from anywhere where this is no wireless internet.  Why they decided to change to this process is beyond me.  I am going to return it and buy the UK version that is region free.  I am also going to avoid future purchases with Ultraviolet.  WHV sent out a online survey and I gave it all zeros.  I guess you can see that I don't think that this a good idea.  WHV please go back to normal Digital Copy.
B0067QPVD2|4.0|1982 was a bad year for John Carpenter. His movie, a remake of an already classic sci-fi movie \\"The thing from another world (1951)\\" got trounced at the box office by another Universal studio's sci-fi alien. In years to come, The Thing would become one of the most reveared sci-fi horror films ever. it took almost 30 years for someone to grow some, and give the Thing another go... A remake-prequel. And it totally WORKS!  Let me say this right of the bat. The Thing(2011) is not a remake per-say. It's definatly a prequel. Consider the producers choosing not to call it anything other than \\"The Thing\\". Reason: The Thing (2011) and The Thing (1982) are one film.   Evidence:  The sets are so meticulosly replicated from the 1982 production that it's scary. Even down to the iconic scene   In the first film, when Mcready is walking through the Norwegian base, all burnt out and destroyed, he comes across an axe in a wall. This is the axe that Joel Edgertons character uses to dispatch one of the hands crwaling along the wall before Mary's character burns it. She tells Joel to leave it there, to be found by Kurt in 1982.   The room that the block of ice was kept is also replicated perfectly, right down to the hole in the roof caused by the Thing as it bursts out of the ice in 2011. Kurt sees bright light beaming down onto the block of ice in 1982 that was only just brought back to the ice station only 24 hours before, through the gaping hole the roof, explaining the reason why the hole exists in the first place.  The grenades shown to Mary by Lars, the Norwegian who speaks not english, all plays out in the 1982 film.   The remains of a Thing discovered in 1982 by Kurt and later brought back to the U.S. station and examined revealing the famous Rob Bottin creature with the two merged heads is featured in 2011, showing who was the poor unfortunate who ended up being said creature.  The ship under the ice..! Ever wonder how the ice was so perfectly cut away to reveal the ship in 1982? Answered.  Ever wonder how the ship got under the ice in the first place. Answered.  Who was the Norwegian shot by \\"el-Capitan\\" in the first film. Answered  In closing, there is so much to suggest a prequel than a remake. Also it's bloody good.  Enjoy!  Raider1 out..!
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|So this is the last film of the last book, and it was worth waiting for :)  I try to buy the triple edition releases now (BR+DVD+Digital), unless the price differential is too high, so I can put them on a computer if need be.
067144901X|5.0|Everyone in my daughters family (4 boys age ranges 1 -9) love the book.  I bought it for the 1-yr old grandson but the 4-yr old likes it and trys reading it from sight and memory, the older ones (8-9) read it to the younger ones.
0451197879|5.0|Read this book way before I found out it was a Steve King book. I absolutely loved it and it was impossible to put down. Yes I am a fan of Steven King, but thought I was one for Richard Bachman. It has been many, many years since I read it, but still remember it as though I read it a year ago. Told so many people about this super book and great author. Imagine my shock and surprise to find out that it was a pseudonym.
B002BWP49C|3.0|I wish that Catherine Hardwicke had directed \\"Breaking Dawn\\". \\"Twilight\\" was wonderful! It was very character driven.  The director made the most of the scenery, the music and the actor's nuances and abilities. \\"Breaking Dawn\\" was disappointing. I would have loved to have seen more Edward and Bella honeymoon moments.   The wedding was lovely.  However the speeches (with the exception of Edward's, which was perfect!) were far too short.  In the book, Bella says that Renee and Esme got along like a house-on-fire.  There was none of this in the movie.  It would have been nice to see the two Mums helping Bella chose her wedding gown, the flowers etc.  From the trailer, you're lead to believe that Edward and Bella spend some time dancing with the locals in Rio.  In reality they only spent approx. 5 seconds kissing in front of the locals.  It would have been lovely to see a lingering Bella/Edward street dancing scene very much in the style of the school ball finale in \\"Twilight\\".  I liked the honeymoon.  However it needed to have more Edward and Bella walking along the beach, swimming in the moonlight, cuddling on the bed etc. Robert Pattinson has a beautiful smile.  His whole face lights up.  We needed to see more of it.  Robert also has very expressive eyes.  The film needed more of the Bella/Edward tender looks and touches.  A female director understands the romantic things that ladies love and want to see.  There should have alot more Edward supporting Bella during her difficult pregnancy.  One of the best parts of the whole movie is when Jacob accidentally sees Bella and Edward on the couch in an inimate moment - enjoying and delighting in the miracle that they've created.    Catherine Hardwicke did such a wonderful job directing \\"Twilight\\".  It's still my favourite movie out of all four.  I just wish and would LOVE to see what she would have done with \\"Breaking Dawn\\".  It could have been so very much better.
B004GYY714|5.0|This is a great little application. Listen to radio stations all over the world from your phone! It's very stable and allows you to set up a favorites list so you can access those you listen to frequently quickly and easily.
B005ER6SNM|4.0|I watched the uncut version online, and I didn't think it was that bad. Yes, it's incredibly disturbing and deals with graphic depictions of rape, abuse, necrophilia, and pedophilia. I can see why it's so controversial but it was so sick and twisted that I actually liked it. I probably won't watch it again or anytime soon. I can't stress enough that you need a strong stomach and a sick twisted mind like me to watch this film. Milos is a retired porn star who has a wife and a son. He comes across an 'art-maker' named Vukmir that is making a snuff film and wants Milos to star in it. The 'art' only gets worse and more brutal down the road. If you think you're ready, you might enjoy A SERBIAN FILM!!!
0439813786|5.0|When I started seeing trailers for a movie called \\"Hugo,\\" and not really knowing what it was about, I did some looking and found it's based on this book.<br /><br />After reading a bit about the book, I discovered that it was apparently pretty good, so I wanted to see for myself.<br /><br />I'm glad I did, because it's breathtaking.  The story is superb, but the illustrations are what really remain with me.  Simply magnificent.<br /><br />I'll keep this review short, because many of the other reviewers have already covered the merits of the book in full detail, so I'll just say that I loved it and would recommend it to anyone.
B0034G4OQS|4.0|There's really not too much to say about this movie. It was good, and had heart-warming moments, but wasn't great. On Christmas Eve night, Santa Claus and his elves control an ultra-high-tech sleigh called the S-1. Santa's son, Steve is up to be the new Santa next year. The other son, Arthur is an embarrassment that answers children's letters to Santa. When Gwen is forgotten, Arthur decides to take the gift to her himself. With the help of Grand-Santa and an elf that's an expert in wrapping named Bryony, they must deliver the present before dawn, or else. If you want a good heart-warming Christmas movie, I'm sure you'll enjoy ARTHUR CHRISTMAS!!!
B005KELQEU|4.0|I purchased the Belkin Portfolio sleeve as a xmas gift for my husband. Because it is not yet xmas I cannot give a true review from my husband's viewpoint; however, I can tell you why I purchased this case over others. I took into account the reviews and description of the information on Amazon and made my purchase based on that; it looked like it would be sturdy enough to protect the Kindle Touch well.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|From the very beginning on American Idol I was a Scotty McCreery fan.  I am a senior who appreciates most types of music.  His young man has a great career ahead of him.  His style and looks are great, the young people today can look at him and see a young man who is religious and clean living and can still have a future career in entertainment.  What a pleasure to watch and hear him perform.  I hope he has another CD coming out soon.  Maybe even a Christian song selection.  Just want more of Scotty's music.  Thank You.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I have a Kindle 1, 2, and the Kindle Fire as well as an iPad so I am familiar with a variety of cases. I find this case to be just fine in holding the Kindle Fire and making it easy to read since I can bend it fully back and out of the way. I consider it to be similar in design to the \\"smartcover\\" for the iPad although, of course, it doesn't turn off the Kindle when it is closed like the SmartCover. For those who want something more substantial, I do have a suggestion. Prior to the arrival of the cover, I simply took my old Kindle 1 cover and used it for the Kindle Fire. The Kindle Fire fit into the slot for the Kindle 1 and was held by the elastic band for the Kindle 1 just fine. For traveling, I will probably continue to use my old Kindle cover, but for reading in bed, the plastic cover is just fine - lightweight and completely out of the way when reading. I think it's level of protection is fine for using around the house or in my purse.
B000002VSN|5.0|Loved, Loved, Loved the movie and now I can listen to those great and wonderful  songs that Whitney has made famous.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|A spectacular movie with brilliant sound and picture, and a DVD version as well! Definitely worth adding to any collection!
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|This cd is absolutely the ultimate!  I have always loved listening to Whitney and she didn't fail her fans on this cd.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|For being the last of the franchise,this movie held up to most of the expectations. The only thing is unless you either read the books or online versions,so much is missed by just watching the movie. But thats the same for all books to movies i suppose. The movie itself arrived on time and in perfect condition. The only thing i didnt care for is there are a ton of advertisements before the movie starts,but a few clicks of the \\"skip\\" button and youre through it pretty quickly.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I love to listen to Whitney Houston and I just love her Christmas Cd's. I would recommend this Cd to everyone.
1595141715|4.0|Heard about this book and it's subject matter.  Ordered it for a 15 year old nephew who's a freshman in High School.  I read it before sending and while it reads as a mystery I couldn't put it down.  I haven't read a book in 1 sitting since Harry Potter.  Should be mandatory reading.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|One word: Fantastic. They just get better and better every year. There were some issues with the audio mix but nothing that couldn't be corrected by turning the volume up. If you're a Rush fan. GET IT!
B000Q79HTC|4.0|This is a very fun movie, just as good when I rewatched it last week as when I saw it in theater years ago. Die-hard Ludlum fans like myself should be aware that, just like always with Hollywood, they've changed a LOT from the original book. It's been \\"updated\\" and Bourne is nowhere near as conflicted as he was in the original.
B004O4LWGY|4.0|Zafon is a very good story teller.<br />Fiction at it's best. Strong character development<br />and unusual plots. Highly recommended.<br />Settle in, the pages turn themselves.
B0052U59F4|5.0|Looking for something to new to read and I come across this book under the erotic section. It seemed like it would be an ok read. I was totally wrong. This book has made it to one of my favorites. It doesn't have amateur writing. This is a full on romance that I still am trying to find in others. I would definitely recommend to anyone and everyone. Once your done with this, go on and read the second installment. It get's better and juicier.
0451232577|5.0|Fall of the Giants is by far one of the best books I have ever read and I read a good deal of them. Highly recommended. Anxiously waiting for book 2 of this series to come out in 2012.
B003VANOFY|4.0|The product provides great surround sound and microphone capability.  It has a nice control panel that allows you to change your voice, check the charge of the headset, etc. .  It is a comfortable headset but I did notice after several hours of wearing it that it irritated my ear just a little, but I think I have adjusted that to fix the issue (that is the only reason I give it four stars instead of 5, since I want to make sure it can last hours an remain totally comfortable).  I know another user who has worn it for 8 hours of play without any discomfort which is great, I just have not had time to play anything even close to that long for one sitting.
B004I744AS|5.0|A worthy addition to your reference apps.  I like the multisource presentation of definitions, and the home page is interesting too.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|It's strange how a movie about cowboys and aliens can be both original and a bit cliche at the same time. Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie, but the human drama in between alien attacks is old fashioned and familiar. Example? Gruff, stubborn rancher Harrison Ford distrusts Indians, but later has to save the Indian chief in the heat of battle, and the two make eye contact and nod to each other out of respect. As a fan of westerns, i've seen that moment countless times before in other movies. Still, its all in good fun and very well produced. Daniel Craig makes a great cowboy and Harrison Ford was excellent. I bought it before seeing the film, based on the premise, and i was not disappointed.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|I bought this to protect my new white 4S. And it does. I dropped my phone + case on the asphalt driveway the other day. Neither the phone nor the case was visibly damaged. Full back (except for the Apple logo cut-out), full side, and front edge coverage is fantastic and the material, somewhere between the soft silicone and the hard plastic of other covers, is grippy and feels sturdy. The included screen film is okay...it didn't quite seal 100% around the home button but it's acceptable. And I had to buy an inexpensive film for the back of my phone since none was included with the AmazonBasics case. Too bad that.
B001ADPMQS|5.0|DVD in great condition. Delivery prompt. I was very pleased with the description and happy to find such an old movie on DVD. Thank you!

140053271X|5.0|This year for Christmas I thought it was important to buy a reader for my grandchildren.  We usually have a smaller limit since we have seven grandchildren.  Having been a teacher, I know how important reading is so felt this was an important product.  One of the grandsons has physical problem so can't carry heavy books.  this will allow him to download the book and not carry five books weighing over fifty pounds.  Great product for a good price.
B005HPY8LU|5.0|good cd from a very good singer. would purchase it again. really like the song \\"stronger\\". very good transaction. thank you Amazon

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3U7D91NRZ3LR8]]Just a basic look at the case, so you know exactly what it is you're getting into.   Also, I didn't talk about the inside of the flap at all. It's felty, so it kind of doubles as a screen cleaner as well. I'm kind of a spaz about finger smudges, but they mysteriously go away due to the inside of the cover flap.
B000F9RB8A|5.0|I've always been a fan of Stephen Chow and his uniquely quirky sense of humour and I had watched his earlier films like the \\"God of Cookery\\" for example and his secret agent spoof but his films always seemed to start and develop well but to always have lame endings in addition to being rather shallow and one-dimensional at times.  That is until this great film which balances the same comedy with a very good story of redemption and of how two \\"losers\\" finally make it good.<br /><br />In \\"Kung Fu Hustle\\" we finally get a very good Stephen Chow ending which never fails to bring a tear to my eye each time I watch it.  This is why this film has now become my favourite movie of his and this Blu-ray release doesn't disappoint.  The picture and sound quality is very good and has to be watched in the original Cantonese with English subtitles if necessary to truly appreciate this.  The special features are really nothing to crow about if you are into these extras but for me I'm not too fussed about these and the interview for instance was quite pathetic here with the condescending tone and stupid questions of the interviewer clearly frustrating Stephen Chow who looks like he'd rather be having a root canal than to have to endure it.<br /><br />As for the movie itself it was the usual brand of Stephen Chow comedy where he intersperses spoofs of various western movies with madcap/slapstick comedy and we clearly get allusions to \\"The Matrix\\" even to the point of him being called \\"the One\\" like Neo at the end when he finally achieves his full potential.  We even get a spoof of Kubrick's \\"The Shining\\" in one scene when he helps the Beast to escape not to mention the reference to the Roadrunner cartoons when he is running away from the landlady etc.  What makes this rise above the usual Stephen Chow outing is the great other story within the story with the flashbacks explaining why the Chow character behaves the way he does as an adult and how he finally finds redemption.<br /><br />This is an excellent Stephen Chow film and it is in my opinion his best to date and this blu-ray version is a real treat with its excellent picture and sound quality when viewed in the original language.<br /><br />Highly recommended!phen Chow film and it is in my opinion his best to date and this blu-ray version is a real treat with its excellent picture and sound quality when viewed in the original language.  Highly recommended!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Don't rate a product 1-star based on what it's not. Rate a product for what it is. Please. 1-star ratings because this isn't the extended version with all the bells and whistles, so on and so forth? Did the box say that this is the version with all the bells and whistles? Is this box set misleading people? No. Read the product description, and if you don't like what you're seeing, don't buy it. Nobody is forcing you to buy this box set! But if you do buy it, rate it for what it is. I am rating this box set as 5-star because (1) it has all the HP movies in one box, (2) the presentation is professional-looking, (3) the movies play wonderfully, (4) the image is superb, (5) the sound is superb, and (6) the product is exactly as advertised, no more, no less. I got what I paid for, and I am very pleased with the product. 5-star pleased. End of story.
0307949486|1.0|This is a long, incredibly boring and badly written book that is full of noxious, misogynistic drivel and really boring, old school, stereotypical male fantasies. It basically is nothing but long, boring, senseless,pointless prose interspersed by a number of rape-torture-murder scenes.<br /><br />How this book has become so popular is a mystery to me. In fact I actually find it deeply worrying. But I really would suggest giving it a miss - especially if you are a sane person who finds cheap \\"repeat rape-torture-murder thrills\\" sickening, ignorant and senseless.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|A friend of mine told me I just HAD to watch The Walking Dead. They promised I wouldn't be disappointed! They were right. My only disappointment is that the first season is only 6 episodes long. That is not nearly enough zombies! It is like watching a zombie movie that just doesn't end. It is fabulous! You absolutely must watch!
0553801473|4.0|Just finished Dance with Dragons.  Is it as good as the first three books?  No.  Is it still a wonderful read you can't put down, leaving you breathless for the next volume?  YES, absolutely!!!  The backlash on poor Mr. Martin reminds me of what was once said about the Marx Brothers, \\"their worst is still better than most other's best.\\"  The same is true for George R. R. Martin, and this book is definitely an improvement over the fourth tome, \\"A Feast for Crows.\\"<br /><br />Yes, this series' story is spinning out of control, with more characters than can be kept straight, even with the lengthening tables in the back of the book (how about alphabetizing them next time?) - fortunately the author provides brief intro's each time he re-introduces his old favorites.  And he raises more questions than he answers in this series, even questions from the first few books remain unanswered (Jon's uncle? Theon?).  Also, both this book and the last could have used a bolder editor's parings, they do ramble a bit.<br /><br />Still, in spite of these trivial faults, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, it was one of those \\"too good to finish\\" novels that one savors like a fine dinner to be enjoyed slowly and carefully!  Mr Martin's prose remains at a high standard as ever, his characters continue to impress us, the plot twists and intrigue continue to amaze - the horrors, pleasures and poetry of life all shimmer like gold!  It hurts to think I'll have to wait years to learn what happens to my favorite characters (for me, Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister and Arya Stark, yet Martin has a clever way of making you care about even his worst inventions, he breathes true life into them, and each character is a realistic mixture of good and evil that you care about as if they were real people).  What five books of fiction covering over 4,000 pages can engage anyone as much as this series has?  This is an amazing ride, and you owe it to yourself to take it!  Thank you, Mr. Martin, for giving us this wonderful new world to enjoy, and please complete it in the next two volumes, the sooner the better!
B005I64U34|4.0|I know critics did not like this movie, but I thought it was a great super hero movie.  I love super hero movies and this one had everything a good super hero movie needs.  It has a great hero , who has alien contact. He turns from a regular guy into a great hero.  Then. He accepts the duty to save the universe.  After some great action  he wins .  Critics I think always gives super hero movies a hard time.  I think this movie is one they wrongly reviewed.
0385343175|5.0|I have ordered many books from Amazon.  They are the only place to order books. I have always gotten them on time and it is so easy to order.  The book Hotel Vendome was a wonderful book.  It was filled with excitement and I enjoyed reading it.
1451627289|2.0|To me, Stephen King's writing changed significantly since the accident.  Just my thoughts.  This behemoth had me wondering often \\"can we get past the excruciating details and get on with the story?!?!\\"  It plodded and became predictable \\"Gee, I wonder what the past is going to put in George's way next?!?\\" to the point that you could even predict what was coming yourself. (A tree blocked the street in Dallas?  Really?  C'mon Steve!  I understand the \\"harmonization,\\" but jeez!) And the kitschy treatment of the numerous strings of time was a complete let-down after so much build up, like it was thrown in because it was expected.  Size definitely does not matter, Stephen.  A big book is not necessarily a good book and with \\"Under The Dome\\" and this one, I am beginning to think he's just piling on more and more unnecessary stuff.  And the whole thing is chocked with his oft-annoying liberal commentary on the world in general, which has me turning further and further from his writing.  Didn't see that unnecessary crap in Christine or Pet Sematary that I can remember.   Redundant and eventually annoying.  Too bad.

B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|Just watched 300 in Blu Ray.... Great sound... Visuals looked good, but 300 was shot a certain way with grain... It's still there. This isn't 80's movies grain we are talking about here, it's a different type of grain.   Still a lot of fun.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|*** No Spoilers at All***<br /><br />I had mixed expectations about Cowboys and Aliens. At first I was quite intrigued by the over-all idea of mixing a western with a sci-fi, and also having Jon Favreau direct such a film greatly boosted my lust to watch this film. However it got mixed reviews and did not seem to stay in theaters for too long. I should have known better to listen to the negative reviews.<br /><br />Cowboys and Aliens is a very fun movie which is a western drama wrapped in an alien action movie. I am not a fan of western movies at all, however with Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford at the helm in this movie, I knew to look past my reservations about western flicks.Even though it has a fast pasted start, Cowboys and Aliens does not waive from building a character. Harrison Ford in particular has a very strong disposition and I felt as though I could relate to his personality and character the most. Daniel Craig did a great job for such a complicated role he had.<br /><br />I was blown away by the special effects, yes you could tell that they were CGI, however they were done very well and blended in perfectly with the environment. The sound effects also were very well done.<br /><br />The picture and audio quality of this Blu-ray are some of the best I have ever seen and heard. The PQ in particular was breathtaking. There was little to no grain and the depth and clarity were outstanding throughout. The bonus features were also great. Many movies lately seem to leave out bonus features which we all take the time to enjoy.<br /><br />Over-all I am very happy with my blind buy and greatly enjoyed this movie. Some friends came over, and out of the hesitant six of us, we all loved it. Much better than expected. Highly recommended and quite enjoyable.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|There is apparently no season 2 as yet. I ordered it but got Season 1 which I had already watched. Apparently season 2 comes out in 2012. Season 1 is very good, love the way the characters all come together and interact.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I have always enjoyed Michael Buble's music. This Christmas CD, much of which is produced by David Foster,  is AWESOME.  It is a must have for any lover of Christmas music.  \\"It's Beginning to Look a lot Like Christmas\\" is a new classic.  Move over Bing Crosby!  There are so many great songs on this CD.  \\"Santa Baby\\", usually sung by a women, is changed to fit a man's Christmas list.  Another favorite of mine is \\"Feliz Navidad\\", which is a duet sung with the South American sensation Thalia.  Buy this CD and crank it up as you're writing Christmas cards and wrapping presents.

0811875040|5.0|This book is a real treat.  I had already tried 5 Macaron recipes and decided to try Miette's although I was not happy with the appearance of 'bumps'. They were however the best!  They had 'feet'!!  The recipe says to grind the almonds in the food processor but the side bar says to do it in a spice grinder.  I have done it both ways and find the spice grinder tedious but it works.  Great book.

B004X80QNG|4.0|I don't know what the others are talking about when they ask for a widget. This is the first time that I am using this product and I absolutely love it. It is a more detailed task manager than the ones that come with my Motorola Atrix. But, I saw an issue. When I tried to see if I could create and edit events and tasks by connecting the phone to my pc, I would get a force close dialog box that keeps coming back, even if you press force close.  One addition I think would be even greater, if you could create an emulator for the pc to provide quicker entry for appointments and tasks. I am a full time student and stay at home mom and I have a lot of deadlines and appointments to make at once. It takes too long to enter the data in. Otherwise, I love it! keep up the good work.
1451648537|5.0|I have never owned an Apple product, but it is amazing the amount of interest Steve Jobs inspired over the years compared to the little that was actually known about him.  I am from Los Altos, CA where he was raised, so if nothing else it was an interesting read if only for the sense-of-place, but the book turned out to be so much more than that.    Steve Jobs chose Walter Isaacson to write his story, and the book was for the most part fascinating and fast-moving, thorough, interesting and cringe-worthy, but I believe I could hear refrains of Cole Porter's song \\"I've got you under my skin, I've got you deep in the heart of me, So deep in my heart, that you're really a part of me ...\\" as I was reading.  I think a biographer has to like the person he is writing about even if he is basically unlikable, but where does he draw the line?  In the case of Steve Jobs who obviously knew that he was a rather unpleasant person and was cocky enough to be proud of that, I think maybe Mr. Isaacson didn't know what to do with that information.  There are plenty of laugh-out-loud quotes in the book, responses to Steve Jobs' rude, crude and egotistical rants and murmurings; it turns out that Jobs had no obvious sense of humor, but thankfully many of those he threw jabs at did, and their witticisms are quoted in the book.  Yea for the quick and stinging comeback!  Not that SJ was stung by any of it; I don't think much penetrated his hard head other than his own stuff which was a constant source of amusement to him.  Very early in the book I remarked to my husband several times how painful it must have been to be one of his children, and as the book wore on I expanded this to include his wife, parents, sisters, co-workers and probably anyone who knew him for any length of time.  Psychologically he was a most damaged man, probably Narcissistic, Bi-Polar, and most certainly he had a diagnosable Borderline Personality Disorder.  I believe it was only his innate sadness that permitted himto engender the love and respect of so many people.  The book moves right along at a rapid pace until about the two-thirds mark, at which point his incessant tantrums, crying and name-calling become redundant.  The crying was particularly annoying and quite unprofessional, and the bragging puts me in mind of Charlie Sheen's silly \\"Winning!\\" refrain.  This said, the book is easy to read and I am aware that in order to place an individual in any sort of historical context a sufficient amount of time must elapse, but Isaacson's book is a fine beginning and it has my vote (were it possible) for the Pulitzer Prize.
0061537969|1.0|I just had to have my say with so many positive reviews.  I find this book totally boring. I'm not at all interested in racing, which is 3/4 of the book.  The dog is not even very lovable to me. The story is a downer.  I'm sorry I bought it.

B0064NTZJO|5.0|This movie was AWESOME, the soundtrack it great, the acting is spectacular, and it's actually original. For lack of a better word this movie is mysterious, mysteriously awesome that is. It has a real gritty feel to it and you will be on the edge of your seat. If you see this movie without the expectation that you are seeing a fast and furious flick you won't be disappointed; trust me.

0439023513|2.0|To many readers, myself included, Collins' characters are dimensional, colorfully human, and highly believable, until they are thrown around carelessly in \\"Mockingjay.\\" The relationships and character dynamics barely hold themselves together, and, being weak, are only hungry to crawl through the thick of the pages in this third book to then wrap their quarrels up quickly and hurriedly through the last few pages of the series. The detailed notes and depictions of the relationships in The Hunger Games and Catching Fire (particularly between Katniss and Peeta) were depicted well and helped readers fall in love with this series, but could not have been more dryly lain out for the reader in this 'conclusive' book. You will receive an ending--a fairly understandable one--but you will leave this book wishing for a lot more, and most likely written by a fan, who in my opinion, could do a much better job in giving readers the conclusion they can better hold onto and ponder for the following years as Collins headed her readers into numb, blurry, and unneeded territory. A lot of what is unnecessary is here. Most of what you want from leaving Katniss and her story is not.

0142000655|5.0|John Steinbeck is one of the greatest American novelists of the past century. All of his work is outstanding and East of Eden is a remarkable example. The characters are larger than life so that they stand out against the human condition. Samuel Hamilton is the essence of goodness, Cathy Trask is evil personified, even to the mark of Cain on her forehead. The book covers three generations in the lives of two families in the Salinis Valley of California. The first part deals with Samuel, then the plot shifts to Adam and Cathy Trask and finally to their two sons. As the title indicates a biblical theme runs through the book. The Chinese servant Lee, uses the word \\"Timshel\\" meaning \\"thou mayest\\" to indicate that man has free will to do good or evil. The characters struggle with good and evil for some 600 pages.  Finally, the end comes but it is really not an ending, just a continuation.  I rarely give five stars to a book, but East of Eden deserves it.

B0036S4CTS|5.0|A lot has been said and written a bout this book, so there is little to add. However, it lived up to the hype. The author did a great job of creating distinctive and very believable characters with voices that resonate very well with reality. The way the story is written reminds me of the the thriller Triple Agent Double Cross. The plot in this story is brilliant and the setting makes it even more appealing. There are tons of lessons in this book. In short, this mesmerizing story attests to the creative mind of the author.
B006B3975Y|2.0|I followed the Roots since their early days in Philly and applauded their success on the Fallon Show, but I don't like them as much as I used to.  they used to be hard hitting in music and beats, but now its all smooth mellow flow more like hip hop easy listening.

They are a collection that surpasses the passing of time with plot twists and turns that are guaranteed to keep any reader spellbound page after page.<br /><br />I've always had a fascination with mystery stories, and I can honestly say that no one does it better than Doyle. As I watch the master investigator calmly solve the most \\"singular\\" of mysteries through the eyes of Dr. James Watson, I almost want to myself be transported back to 19th century London. I am reminded, in adventure after adventure, that there is no substitute for a sharp mind and careful observation. With this collection there is no doubt that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is a literary master for all times!

He has two of objectives before he turns 16: the first is to lose his virginity before his birthday and second is to break up his mother and an ex lover who has suddenly appeared in her life, which concerns him as she may be cheating on his father. \\"  This film that is rated R makes some very weird twists and turns. I can honestly say that I was confused at times in what it was trying to actually say! I can honestly say that I have seen other movies that were very good and funny that were of the same subject that did the job much better than this one had done.   I will admit that I did giggle in a few areas of this film, but I really cannot recommend purchasing this video unless you have extra money to waste. I would recommend renting it if you're curious to see it.   I hope this review is helpful so you know if this might be something of your interest.
1451627289|5.0|It's been a while since I read a King novel. There was a time where I read them the minute they came out, and didn't take a break until I was done. Then something happened. It might be related to the length of some of his works, and the fact that my reading time was cut into dramatically by, well, life. Although I liked the premises of novels like [[ASIN:1416585710 Lisey's Story: A Novel]] and [[ASIN:1416552960 Duma Key: A Novel]] , I would pass them over in favor of other reading material, and a large part of that was because of the size of some of these novels, and the time investment they would entail.   But I latched onto this one shortly after I acquired it, and I'm glad I read it. I never thought of myself as a fan of alternate histories, but this book worked for me. Part of it is that I've always been sort of interested in the Kennedy assassination (I own [[ASIN:1400034620 Case Closed]] and a few conspiracy theory books), and the idea that someone could go back in time to change things appealed to me.   But what I found as I read this book is that the parts concerning Oswald and Jake/George's interaction with him were not the parts that kept me coming back - it was the story that took place in Jodie, Texas, and the characters I met there. Yeah, it was fun to meet up with Richie and Bev in Derry, shortly after the events from the first part of It. Yeah, it was interesting to view Lisbon Falls through two lenses, side by side almost. But George's relationship with Sadie was the part of this book that worked for me, and in a powerful way.   We all know King can tell a story like few of his contemporaries (or like anyone, perhaps). This story doesn't disappoint. At times it was overly wordy. There was some stuff that I felt could have been left out, that didn't interest me...mostly about Oswald and the neighborhoods in the DFW area. Some of that stuff I skimmed a little, I admit. But I didn't skim the pages that told of George's interactions with Sadie, or Mike and Bobbi Jill, or Deke and Mimi. That was where this story shined, and without it, this could have been a run of the mill story.   With it, I think it stands with some of King's best works. Just my opinion, but I'm sticking with it.   flag
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ready Player One is a geektastic fanboy declaration to the 1980's and one heck of a fantastic novel. Ernest Cline weaves a tale of epic proportion that takes the readers on a quest to the past, but weaves it into a future that is so technologically advanced that I am not sure it is even one that we would want to entertain.<br /><br />Ready Player One (RPO) centers on Wade Watts an 18yr old orphan who has dedicated his life to James Halliday's quest. Halliday is the Steve Jobs of RPO; he created the OASIS a virtual simulated world that everyone uses instead of real life. Upon his death he created a contest, 3 magical keys hidden throughout the OASIS, which will each unlock one gate, the first person to find all 3 keys and opens all the gates and finds the golden egg completes the quest and wins Halliday's fortune. While scouring this virtual world Wade manages to make friends, enemies and maybe even find love.<br /><br />RPO throws 80's pop culture and trivia at you from page one, almost to the point that if you are not familiar with the decade it will go over your head and seem pointless at times. I found myself loving the trivia and references, especially the movie and television references. The only thing I found a little annoying was that at times the pop culture was used as a crutch to push the story along making it seem a tad over used.<br /><br />Ernest Cline should be proud of his debut; I think that it will appeal to fantasy and science fiction fans as well as 80's pop culture junkies. There is a quest, love, action and electronics, basically something for everyone. RPO is well written and keeps you on your toes. I have a feeling that this book will be a cult favorite for years to come.

0525423281|5.0|Quirky and Cute, that is what I was left thinking when I finished Lola and the Boy Next Door by Stephanie Perkins. Every so often you need a pallet cleansing book, and by that I mean a thoughtless feel good light book to help with all the heavy emotional books out there. Lola is just that type of book.<br /> Lola is quirky, she dresses quirky she has two quirky gay dads and a quirky rock and roll boyfriend....have I emphasized quirky enough? She starts off sure of who she thinks she is and what she wants, but as the story unfolds there are cracks in resolve. Her next door neighbor Cricket Bell returns and we find out Lola may not know exactly who or what she wants.<br /> If you have read Anna and the French Kiss, than you already know what to expect with Lola, in fact Anna and St. Clair are supporting characters to Lola in this companion novel. Stephanie follows a very specific flow with her love stories, but it's the charm of her characters that make the story so entertaining. Lola is a bit deeper than Anna, and her obstacles are a bit more heavy, but it makes this story even more engaging and for the better.<br /> There are going to be plenty of people describing Lola as \\"chick-lit\\", and while it is heavy on the romantic angst, it's over all a gender defying feel good story. I never stop myself from picking up a book just because the cover and the premise may gear towards the girls, Lola is a great book that guys will enjoy just as much as the girls.

0525423656|4.0|I liked Matched by Ally Condie, but I was not as impressed with it as other people were. I felt it lacked uniqueness, it felt too much like dystopias before it. Crossed on the other hand was enormously better, in my opinion, and actually felt more like an exciting new novel with the characters of Matched thrown in.<br /><br />Picking up shortly after the events of Matched, Crossed switches up the format by taking turns switching from Cassias point of view to Kys. Cassia has journeyed to the Outer Provinces in search of Ky. Not knowing exactly where he was taken, she is on a mission to find him and join the resistance against the society. Ky is trying to make his way back to Cassia, he breaks away from the society at the perfect moment of diversion in hopes of being able to return to her. Adding a few new minor characters to support the two until there destined meeting, and keeping the love triangle with Xander (with only a brief actually appearance) a possibility. Crossed stets the stage for the final book in the series.<br /><br />I felt like I was reading a different series this time around. Cassia felt like a different character, she was more developed to me this time around, making me like the story more. I felt like the author had found her voice and the writing finally showed it. There was a bit of history to the society and the resistance, making the background of the story more engaging, but also making me want to see where the journey is actually heading. I did find the story a bit slow at times; there were pacing issues with the switching of characters points of view but nothing that I couldn't easily over look. I actually like having Kys point of view because I felt like it broke up some of Cassias monotony, and gave us another prospective of the rebellion and what it has cost some people.<br /><br />Crossed gave me hope for this trilogy. I felt that as the second novel instead of lagging and building, as most tend to do in my opinion, it pushed forward and left me wanting to read the final novel to see how it all will play it out in the end. I hope that those of you who read Matched and were discouraged or unsure of the series like I was give Crossed a shot, because I believe that it will make up for what Matched lacked.o read the final novel to see how it all will play it out in the end.

1609611543|2.0|Suppose you heard about a book written by someone who caused the hump on his back to shrink noticeably by eliminating watermelon from his diet.  Would you buy it?  That's kind of what we have here.  The author suffers from extreme wheat intolerance, has researched the topic extensively and stretched the data out of shape in an attempt to create the spectacular notion that wheat is the single largest cause of obesity and a host of other maladies such as diabetes worldwide.  In the big picture, you have to ask why this doctor hasn't won the Nobel Prize for this epiphany?  That question will lead you to the disbelief I have that this book should be taken with more than a grain of salt.  First, much of the science about weight gain, diabetes and the like is fuzzy at best.  He claims, for instance that beta cells in the pancreas are destroyed when gluten is consumed.  OK, how many cells for how much gluten?  Nobody knows.  While you ponder that issue, google avogodro's number to get some idea of how many cells might be floating around in there.  The science is also not settled on the notion of whether these cells, once destroyed, can be or are regenerated.  Also,aside from cells, moles and other technical issues, he also exaggerates on the non scientific level.  He brushes by but does not adequately discuss resistant starches- the concept that pasta that is cooked al dente, for instance, is not digested as rapidly as the fully cooked variety and thus has a more muted effect on blood sugar.  He also brushes by the whole concept of net carbs, where fiber again blunts spikes in foods such as rice and others.  I could bore you with much more of this stuff.  On the other hand, there is enough factual material to scare my consumption of white bread down at least a notch, even after I have now mastered the fine art of producing crusty and tasty baguettes in my own home oven, ones with those large irregular holes used to cling to delicious meats, cheeses and spreads and for which I practically weep when they come out of the oven.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Kermit the Frog has to be one of the most-recognized celebrities of our time; this 50th anniversary edition of A CHRISTMAS CAROL continues his dominance! What a wonderful movie this is - great for the whole family. It sticks to Dickens' original version as closely as you'd expect the Muppets to. :D Don't hesitate: for a wonderful family tradition, purchase this video and watch every Christmas!
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Ok here's the skinny, I love the movie simply because \\"Follywood\\" did not totally screw it up. I am still pissed as all hell about the fact that when \\"Follywood\\" gets their hands on a comicbook character they think they can outdo the original writers, sorry \\"Follywood\\" big mistake, it ain't happenning.  Who say's ain't, ain't a word ohh yeah, english majors, but I digress.Part of the reason comics are so popular is that they are very well written and the people who read really don't want his or her characters to messed up via \\"Follywood's screenwriters who think they are staying true to the characters or want to put their own spin on a great story. Thor was a great quick shot in to the world of one of Marvels most mistreated characters. We seem to always want to knock down or degrade our demigods, I'm not touching the real deal equation. The movie was definitely cool from a comic book fans perspective, even if there was no Donald Blake involved in the movie. Although his alter ego plays a very pivitol role in the comics until the year 2000,, and while Jane Foster was not a nurse all is forgiven. I came in to the movie not seeing a single trailer on purpose, as I have read and own about 75% of the Thor comics Marvel has produced. I have been reading them since he first ran in to the Hulk, back in Journey in to Mystery issue 112, and then I got in to Norse Mythology. So I am what Marvel would have called back then a \\"True believer\\" or Merry Marvel Madman.  I loved the visuals, the timing was almost flawless and for an actor who was pretty much unknown to most Americans I think he did a really good job, and as always I wanted most special effects , especially when it came to what the hammer is actually capable of doing. I would dare say, that I would like to see another Thor movie this time without  his half brother involved. But as most Most comic book fans of Thor know, that's almost impossible though, but Crusher Creel AKA \\"The Absorbing Man\\" would be a great nemesis for Thor as well as \\"the Celestials\\". Hell there could even be a subplot feautring Hercules after all Thor saved \\"Herc\\" from Zeus's brother Pluto. All in all a well put together effort if not completely accurate by \\"Follywood\\" So yeah, spend your money, put this one in your archives under the \\"Fun, Action, and fantasy section\\", it belongs there. It is way better than either Fantastic Four movies which were such a dissapointment to many fans of the books, but that's \\"Follywood\\" for you, Thos is a great little flick, it's a keeper.s for Thor as well as \\"the Celestials\\".

0060527986|3.0|it is NOT A NOVEL. i'm not sure if there are buried reviews or blatant general descriptions that were grossly overlooked on my part, but i didn't know what to expect out of it...turns out it's written in pseudo-devotional-style passages, each relatively independent of the others..   it has certainly got some encouraging points and passages, however i have let it sit for a while unfinished. compared to other works of coelho, i felt this offered more \\"milk\\" than \\"meat\\" (the latter in which i am more interested.) like i said, it is encouraging at points, but not very challenging overall. to be frank it seemed to be executed somewhat arrogantly, with less heart than other works of his. (though appreciated, nonetheless, for what it is - solid 3, not less)  one man's opinion..
B005J6LKVI|5.0|I have never read this book before.  Truth be told, I am really more into sci-fi and fantasy.  My wife, however, has read this book and is more into this kind of reading that I am.  After having watched it, she said that it left some things out from the book, but that's true of most any book to movie adaptions.  She said overall though that it was pretty close, from what she could remember.  All in all though, we both very much enjoyed this movie.  The acting was superb and the story was very good and at the same time humbling.  In this day & age of tollerance for your fellow man/woman, no matter what the race, it's really hard to believe that there was a period of such racism in our country...but surely enough it happened.  A dark period of time in our nation's history if you ask me.  We are all equal in God's eyes...it's a shame that so many people couldn't understand that and thought themselves superior.  Some of that is even still true today...blind, unseeing people.  Anyway, this movie is very heartwarming and well done, and I highly recommend that everyone give this a watch, no matter what kinda reading/viewing you're into.  It's worthwhile.
B005LJITKI|5.0|This one will go down as one of my favorites. I haven't had such a good laugh since my first time seeing The Hangover.

I think fans of either show will appreciate the type of humor on tap here!
1451627289|5.0|Like many of the better Stephen King novels, \\"11/22/63\\" engages in a kind of beneficial bait & switch.  In this case, readers are buying this book because of the sensational, ambitious premise: a regular guy gets the ability to travel back in time to stop the Kennedy assassination!  That's the main reason we as readers think we're going to enjoy the book.<br /><br />But then, we actually start reading the thing and what we really get is a wonderful, heartbreaking love story; a dozen or so fascinating, very likable characters who we're delighted to visit every time we sit down to read; one of the best dramatizations of the joys and rewards of the teaching profession when the job is firing on all cylinders; and an immersive look at a time that was both simpler and quite unnerving (the latter description fueled by the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and other 1950's and 60's stomach churners of the ongoing and out-of-the-blue variety).<br /><br />And, yes, you do get a decent little plot, sort of like an extended \\"Twilight Zone\\" episode, about a guy trying to stop the Kennedy assassination, laced with all the familiar but always effective \\"be careful what you wish for\\" landmines we've seen in other time travel stories.  In fact, despite its undeniable pleasures (suspense, danger, close calls, etc.), I might have been the tiniest bit disappointed if the time travel/changing history plot was indeed all the book was about, because King doesn't add all that much to the kinds of plots, paradoxes, and surprise results we've seen in the plethora of time travel books, movies, and television productions that have come before.  In fact, he pretty much just puts his own (admittedly, not inconsiderable) polish on those old classic elements, rather than invent new ones.<br /><br />But combined with the storylines involving Jake Epping meeting and falling in love with the elegant but clumsy Sadie Dunhill, his helping a football jock unearth his hidden talent for the stage, and seeing multiple, believable examples of the amazing kindness and generosity people are capable of at their best, there was no need to scrutinize the time travel mission too much, which ultimately came off as an added bonus and not the thing we thought the book would hang everything on.<br /><br />Oh, and though I won't go into specifics, the other thing the book does very well is deliver one of those heart rending, patented \\"I know the right thing to do but it's going to tear me apart to do it\\" Stephen King endings.  And this one's a doozy, perfect but hard to take.  But a final, nicely done grace note at the very end of the novel will at least add a small smile to readers' tears.<br /><br />In the end, I guess everything I discussed above comes to this: you'll dive into this book for the Kennedy plot, but love it for the wonderful, rich novel about people and the myriad ways they can bring out the best in each other, often in the midst of great tragedy and hardship.  Who would have thought that we'd get that wonderful outcome from a novel with the ominous, disturbing, sensational title, \\"11/22/63\\"?<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, with results like this, Stephen King can do the old bait & switch anytime.amples of the amazing kindness and generosity people are capable of at their best, there was no need to scrutinize the time travel mission too much, which ultimately came off as an added bonus and not the thing we thought the book would hang everything on.

The mood and tempo on this soundtrack is much more somber and slow than the other one, but all in all a better compilation.

0439023513|3.0|I grew up reading everything I could get my hands on, and once I got an ereader, this passion was back. My favorite time to dive into a book is at the gym. Once I started this trilogy I found myself working out for way longer than expected so that I didn't have to tear myself away.<br /><br />I don't hate this book, but it didn't immerse me as the first two did. I still tore through this book, but more out of determination to finish it than anything. Once I was finished I kind of just thought, \\"meh\\" and went about my day.<br /><br />I don't HATE this ending as some seem to. This book does seem too short and too long at the same time however. There is so much detail into slogging around, mutts!, details into traps!, hiding in closets!, war is bad! We don't really get details about relationships between the characters, how the war has affected those Katniss loves, or what motivates all these new characters.<br /><br />--spoilers--<br /><br />I would have liked to see the characters evolving. Peeta is tortured and crazy, then he is okay again. He doesn't grow stronger or more interesting, he just is (sort of) back to normal. Their relationship doesn't become more realistic or deep, it just \\"is\\" again. Gale is still hardheaded and driven, but instead of relating to this, suddenly Katniss just labels him as a hate-filled monster and he drops out of her life completely. He makes some of the most interesting points in the story, yet those seems to be forgotten along with his friendship. Prim becomes a strong woman, becoming more like Katniss and Gale, then she is suddenly dead. I feel that Prim could have stolen the story with her evolution, even in her death... but no, she just dies so that Katniss can have a reason to give up. Mom is broken again. Haymitch is broken again. Coin, who could have been an interesting character, dies fast and without much note because she is \\"bad\\". The other victors remain mostly unchanged except they may occasionally die for shock value. Katniss feels everything but doesn't seem to learn anything from her decisions. Though she is able to rationalize things quite well in the first books, suddenly she is single-minded. She stays seventeen forever and never grows up or reflects upon her past in any constructive way. Instead she just kind of gives into this guy who loves her for reasons we never fully understand and she never fully reciprocates, has a few kids to whine about, and exists as a mopey teenager forever. Meh.to learn anything from her decisions. Though she is able to rationalize things quite well in the first books, suddenly she is single-minded.

B005WTR4ZI|3.0|The authors present a compelling case that technology will severely disrupt the labor market, but then completely wimp out on their policy recommendations. The advice they give sounds like the talking points of any moderate politician or New York Times columnist. They fail to show how these policy prescriptions will do anything to really address the problem, aside from delaying it by a few years. The inevitable conclusion that they gloss over is that massive redistribution is necessary, but this is too controversial so they avoid it.

1451627289|5.0|I've been a Stephen King fan since I picked up a copy of Salem's Lot when I was in my early teens.  That book (and the great cover) scared the crap out of me. I was afraid my mom wouldn't let me read it, but she was pretty liberal about stuff like that.  I re-read it every couple of years because the characters feel like old friends.  Mr. King has been my faithful companion throughout my adult years -- always entertaining, never boring, and this book was the cherry on my Uncle Stevie-made hot fudge sundae.<br /><br />I loved reading about the late 50s/early 60s.  My mother was pregnant with me during the Cuban missile crisis, and I never even thought about what she must have gone through during that time; how scared she must have been to be carrying her first child and to be only 21 at the time.  That part really got to me.  And she's not around to ask about it.  But, I digress -- I thoroughly enjoyed Jake's time in the past and felt like I was there right along with him.  Stephen King has such a huge talent for developing his characters into either people you really love or really hate.  I enjoyed how the past was so \\"obdurate\\" -- and how it always tried to keep events on track in spite of Jake's (George's) machinations.<br /><br />Loved how George traveled to Derry and met some beloved characters -- King's writing about Derry was so evocative.  I've been to towns where this pall seems to hang over everything so I could identify with that.  Loved the simpleness of the 50's and early 60's and the way he wrote about life back then. I have always loved the cleverness of King's writing -- never fails to make me laugh at his sense of humor.<br /><br />To me this book was all about the journey -- The things Jake went through, the lives he touched along the way, the decisions he made at the end.  I wouldn't change a thing about the book; it had to end the way it did.<br /><br />Thanks for a great time, Mr. King!!

1451627289|4.0|I'm not a Stephen King fan but I do like good science fiction and this is good.  Because of being a King book it is dark and not prone to the \\"happily ever after\\" of other books.  I found the book hard to put down even in the darker parts.  As for the history I found it very interesting, but this isn't a history book in the true sense.  It is a study of the characters and the times.  It spends most of the book giving you the feel of living in the late 50's and early 60's.  It provides very little information on the assasination or what the world would be like if Kennedy weren't assasinated.  The book is a novel.  The one thing I feared and most mentioned among my friends when I told them about reading it was that it might get really creepy, it was Stephen King after all.  The book did not and stayed true to itself as much as a time travel book can.

B005Y423ZC|5.0|I'll leave it to others to review the video quality and all that technical nonsense.  My review is strictly about Adele and her singing.  While I could list a million superlatives to describe how wonderful her singing is, I will simply say:  She moved me.  Not only is she beautiful on the outside, but it is obvious that she has a beautiful soul.  Being a writer myself, I know that the two most inspirational feelings in the world are love and heartache.  She has been impacted by them both.  Sadly, the record companies in the United States of America are only interested in pushing and promoting tasteless trash.  Thank God that we have access to great music from afar.  It is sadly lacking from within.  God bless you, Adele.  You are a blessing, a beauty, and a great singer and performer.  I watched your performance four times this weekend, and it is still in my DVD player, ready to watch again.  The CD is in my vehicle.  You are simply amazing!

0439023513|2.0|First of all, the non-spoiler review.  Collins follows suit with exceptional writing. Her use of powerful adjectives and gripping verbs is here and present, and if I were judging this book based on writing style alone it would easily move me up two stars. Now to the story side of things (still, no spoilers)... Frankly, it's boring. Many times in this book I'm left motivated to finish it simply because I feel after reading the two amazing prequels I have to. There's no suspense- no drive to want to get to the next chapter. I just wanted to get it over with. Moments like these were rare if even present for the first books. And the ending: For anyone who has read the first two books and ready to move on, beware. You may want to make up your own ending as this one, like many other instances in the book, leaves the reader being caught up to what already happened. Instead of being on the forefront of all the events, over and over I found myself being informed by the other characters of what was going on as I lay sick in a hospital bed or stuck in a trance somewhere. The book just isn't up to par with the others.  --SPOILERS BELOW--  Let's back up to book one, where the entire series began: the whole reason the books even exist is to tell the story of Katniss taking the place of her sister at the Games. Okay, so we've established there is a great passion for Prim at this point, and through the rest of not only one and two but the beginning of three her importance as a character and her innocence is only reinforced. So why is it that at the last moment she's killed off? Really? Sounds cheap to me. I mean it really just makes me wonder why I even read the series; what's the point if she dies anyway? Not cool, Suzanne. And it's not that she went out in a gory, epic battle scene with descriptions of everything- no, it was a foggy, \\"What just happened..?\\" type moment where, AGAIN, we're left catching up later on in the series. Between the hospitalizations, the crying in corners, and being informed by some other character what happened this book is basically entirely fog. Dense fog. On more than one occassion I didn't know what was going on, it was as if a grey cartoonish cloud had appeared and all I can see on the outside is the random hand or foot flinging out of the smoke. It just wasn't enjoyable to read this book, it was a burden.  And the ending: Please, need I even say anything? Rewrite, please. If the first two books had a color, they'd be yellow; this one a dark, deep black for it's sense of depression, desperation, violence and horrific sadness.

0307477479|5.0|It's rare for me that a book lives up to its hype.<br /><br />I was concerned after the first few chapters which seemed more like short stories just barely connected by peripheral characters. They were very well-written and compelling on their own, but I was disappointed by the lack of a single story. However, as I read on, I realized the way each story added to the one before it, creating a broader picture.<br /><br />The format of the book makes me think of a prism: each story is a facet of the prism. An inconsequential character from the first chapter is the central character a few chapters later, proving that no one is inconsequential; everyone has their own story to tell. Also, a character who seems utterly lost in an early chapter will have figured things out in a later chapter. And, on the flip side, a character who has a simple, happy childhood will end up committing suicide.  As the stories weave back and forth in time and geography, we see the full spectrum of human experience. (Though, perhaps, a uniquely American one.)<br /><br />On a writerly note: for those interested in this sort of thing, AVFTGS is a great study in point of view. Chapters are written in third person, first person, omniscient, and even the rarely seen second person. If you're trying to figure out the differences and how to successfully pull off each one, I'd recommend this book.<br /><br />But, then, I recommend this book anyway.<br /><br />-Katie O'Rourke, author of Monsoon Season
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Have we become a society that can only think in Black and White, Love and Hate, Win and Lose, Democrat and Republican?  Two opposites without a middle?  The majority of the reviews seem to express either immense love or intense loathing for Tree of Life.  If you read the actual reviews, it seems there are more 2, 3 or 4 star opinions labeled as 1 or 5 stars.  There is a review where one viewer says how much he hates the film, yet he was moved by the depictions in it that recalled strong emotions from his own life.  I believe the best art is able to release emotion, so how is this negated in his 1 star review?  Then there is the 5 star review which says the images are beautiful, but there are parts that aren't compelling for her or that don't hold up as strongly as other parts.  Neither viewer seems to acknowledge their own mixed feelings of the film numerically.  Dare I say we are being socialized to either love something or hate it?  We have to be on one side of the fence or the other.  However, there is no right answer or best opinion.  The beauty of the gray-areas should be embraced.  Where did this come from, and what does it mean for our cultural and artistic future? Just wondering.<br /><br />I applaud Malick for creating a unique, personal work of art.  I found it hypnotic, in the way that Apocalypse Now and 2001 A Space Odyssey are.  It's nostalgic, romantic, and poetic.  It's not for everyone, and I admit it's not something I will pop in the blu-ray player for a light entertainment.  (The blu-ray transfer is gorgeous by the way.) It requires a commitment to give yourself in to the visceral experience.  The film washes over you and takes you on a journey much like life itself.  You don't know where it's going, what will be recalled, what will change, what we'd forgotten, what we missed, what's next, or even what the point of it all is.  But it doesn't matter.  And yet it all matters.  A grand metaphor. Or not.  All valid.  Thanks for reading.

B005TPCQ5I|2.0|One dimensional, no subtlety in the performance which made the characters fall flat in my opinion. Redundant scenes, disappointing ending made it feel like a complete waste of a potentially rich story plot. Fell far short of a success.
B005P78VK4|3.0|Based on what Cirque de Soleil had done with the Beatles catalog on Love, their 2006 magnificent mashup of the Fab Four's fertile imaginations.  I had high expectations for Immortal.  Ah, well, the best-laid plans . . . The sonics are impressive, fatter than on some of MJ's original releases.  The overall presentation, though, seems cobbled together.  Where Love was loaded with creative segues, unexpected layering of songs, and thematic medleys, Immortal merely meanders.  Songs are backed into one another, but large sections are simply replays of excerpts from Jackson's catalog.  You will not hear, for example, the infamous bass line from \\"Billie Jean\\" beneath \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something,\\" or the \\"mama-say, mama-sah\\" final chorus of \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something\\" punching its way into \\"Bad.\\"  It still is a thriller to hear a collage of Jackson's decades of seminal stylings on one disc, but this could have been so much more.

B001DPC4SM|5.0|This album is one of those that is so iconic, it's hard to imagine the music world without it.  I am a huge Prince fan, and while this wasn't my first Prince album (that would be 1999), and while it's not my all-time favorite Prince album (that would be Sign 'O' the Times), this was the first Prince album that I wore out multiple copies of from repeated listening.  Album Review:  Beginning with the first track, \\"Let's Go Crazy,\\" when that woozy, pulsing keyboard comes in and the robotic preacher intones, \\"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to get through this thing called life...\\" you know you're in for something special.  You probably already know this song, but if, for some reason, you don't, it is an propulsive funk/rock/new wave hybrid that dares you not to move.  It also boasts one of the all-time greatest guitar solos ever captured on tape.  At this point, if you aren't impressed, you never will be.  In fact, if you've never heard Prince before, and you're thinking of downloading one single song in order to figure out whether or not you might like him, this is the one.    From there, you move through the sexy, sleek and slinky \\"Take Me With You,\\" the slow, sultry and seductive \\"The Beautiful Ones,\\" the bizarre head-trip and genre-defying \\"Computer Blue,\\" and the nasty funk of the X-rated \\"Darling Nikki.\\"  Then, it's on to side two.    Another ubiquitous song starts this side:  \\"When Doves Cry.\\"  A song that somehow manages to still sound ahead of its time some 25+ years later, this song rides a robotic, hypnotic groove that burrows into your head and can get stuck there for days at a time, all without the help of a bass-guitar (Prince removed it from the song at the last minute, giving it its stark, skeletal feel).    After that comes the live portion of the album.  If you've never seen Prince live, he's amazing, and all you need as proof are the final three songs on this album.  The poppy messianic dance track \\"I Would Die 4 U\\" bleeds into the frenetic workout of \\"Baby I'm a Star.\\"  And then...Purple Rain.    Only a song this epic could close out an album this epic.  From the opening chord, you can almost see the lighters and cell phones go up (nobody had cell phones at concerts back then, but if they had, you can bet that they would all be out and up for this song).  From there, the song builds steadily until that one earth-shattering single guitar note brings the song to a glorious climax.  And then, the cooldown begins.  Three of the last minutes are playout vamping and the last minute-and-a-half is a bizarre keyboard coda.    But not only do you not mind the repetition of the coda, you actually revel in it.  A reviewer once commented that only a song as great as Purple Rain could make you tolerate sitting through an ending so drawn out and seemingly pointless.  But I'd argue that you actually need the ending.  If all Prince songs are like sex (and they are), then this is the afterglow.  It gives you a chance to bask for a minute in the warmth of the feelings the album has produced.  But either way, you'll be surprised how long you find yourself listening to a minor-key warbling keyboard before you finally decide to turn it off (if you ever do).  What else can be said?  A perfect ending to a perfect album.  Sound Review:  If you care about sound, I can't say enough good things about the Warner Bros. 180-gram remastered reissue.  At first, when the guitar came in on \\"Let's Go Crazy,\\" I thought that they had turned it down in the mix.  But then I realized:  no, it just doesn't cut through the rest of the mix so harshly because it sounds so warm and organic.  It squeals and wails when it used to shriek and screech.  This might take some getting used to, and some might argue that they should have turned it up in the mix to compensate, but this is how it was supposed to sound.  This is still very much a guitar album, but now the guitar is not dominating everything else so completely.  It's more of an equal instrument in the overall mix.    I also had never heard the drums sound so much like...well, drums.  I'll make a confession here.  I grew up listening to a lot of CDs in the 80's because they were often easier to find than vinyl, and I always thought that '80's drums just sounded different than '60's or '70's drums.  '80's drums always sounded more synthetic, robotic.  In fact, even on a lot of the '80's vinyl, drums sound different.  But what I've discovered in my later years is that drums have always sounded the same.  What sounds different is how they are recorded and/or mastered onto the record or CD.  For example, the drums at the beginning of \\"Take Me With You\\" used to stutter; now they rumble.  They used to quickly fade; now they echo and linger.  Also, the keyboards sound better.  They used to stab; now they build.  They used to sound like blips and bleeps; now they sound like everything from a piano to a violin.  Of course, this stuff was always there in the mix, and you could probably hear traces of it if you strained your ears, but now it's obvious.  You notice things in the mix you never heard before.  The way the guitars reverberate off the walls of the club in \\"Purple Rain.\\"  Or the way Prince's voice wavers just slightly at the end of the word \\"personality\\" on \\"Baby I'm a Star.\\"  If you were on the fence about this reissue, I can assure you that it's worth it.  The old vinyl sounded better than the CD, but this sounds better than the old vinyl.  Final verdict:  if you love this album, you want this version.
B00664AM5C|4.0|Reposted from September 25, 2011<br /><br />It figures a week after I've seen CONTAGION, director Steven Soderbergh's latest ensemble film, I come down with a cold and a slight cough. Nothing that can't be cured easily with two gel capsules and a glass of water, mind you; however, being sick this week did cause me to pause about the circumstances of my situation.<br /><br />My dumb cold is nothing compared to the shellacking that Gwyneth Paltrow's character goes through within the first 20 minutes of the film: Rushed to the emergency room by hubby Matt Damon, Paltrow goes bug-eyed, convulses, and flatlines. Yep, Our Lady of GOOP goes down in the first half of the film. Much of Contagion is straight to the point with a sledgehammer, but the stakes are never so much higher as soon as Soderbergh kills off one of its leading stars.<br /><br />Similar to the multi-threaded storytelling seen in TRAFFIC, CONTAGION tracks a global epidemic in multiple locales across 90-minutes-or-so. One death becomes three, three become nine, and so on, until governments begin panicking, big pharma clasps its hands in anticipation, and the CDC works day and night looking for a cure. Soderbergh deftly avoids the usual plot contrivances and lavish expenses that plague most disaster flicks, choosing to go for brisk montages of society breaking down as people loot Rite Aids for medicine, corpses piling in the street, and long lines at hospitals.<br /><br />And the talking! If there ever was a film that avoids sloppy expostion, this is it. There's never a moment in CONTAGION where I felt the characters reduced their dialogue to a Cliff Notes pamphlet. At one point, Jennifer Ehle and Laurence Fishburne--both playing a scientist and the head honcho of the CDC respectively--have a sit-down to discuss a mutation in the virus. It's probably the most compelling dramatic scene I've seen this year, if nothing else but to hear the excitement and terror in Ehle's voice as she describes changes in the contagion's pattern and Fishburne calmly nodding in agreement.<br /><br />CONTAGION is intelligent--in some ways, almost overthinking itself. We need more films like it (and not another Roland Emmerich bloatfest), and we need more directors like Soderbergh who are willing to put their roots from independent \\"art\\" films into big-budget genre films.<br /><br />And if nothing else, you can blame the deaths of 12 million people or so on Gwyneth Paltrow.
0786958731|5.0|BASIC DESCRIPTION<br />-----------------<br /><br />This is the 3rd version of the Dungeons and Dragons games. The other two are here:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0786955570 Dungeons and Dragons: Castle Ravenloft Board Game]]<br />[[ASIN:0786955708 Wrath of Ashardalon: A D&D Boardgame]]<br /><br />If you've played any of those games, skip past this part and go right to THE GOOD.<br /><br />It plays the same and the parts are all interchangeable.<br /><br />The basic game is played similar to Dungeons and Dragons 4th edition. You move a character, you attack baddies using class-specific skills and you finish a map by getting a unique item or killing a certain creature.<br /><br />The rules make for a fun, quick game. After just two or three hours, you'll have finished a dungeon. This is awesome for players who don't have the time to invest into full-on roleplaying.<br /><br />You can play this game by yourself or with up to 5 people. The more the merrier. You can play by yourself because the enemies all have their artificial intelligence listed on a card. For instance, you might get a card that says something like:<br /><br />If this creature is more than 2 tiles away, it moves 2 tiles closer<br />If this creature is 2 tiles away or less, it shoots with an Attack +5, 1 damage<br />If this creature is adjacent to a hero, it uses a dagger with an Attack +2, 1 damage<br /><br />Attacks are rolled with a 20-sided die (the only die needed for the game -- it is included). If the 20-sided-die roll + the Attack >= the hero's AC, then it's a hit. So you'd want to engage the creature adjacent to it so that it will have a low chance of hitting your character.<br /><br />If you kill a creature, you gain a treasure and experience. If you ever roll a 20, you can trade experience to level up your character (can only be done once). A leveled up character has better stats and can have more skills.<br /><br />Now onto the good parts and bad parts of this game:<br /><br />THE GOOD<br />--------<br />The figures are the best yet. You get a bunch of goblins and undead along with some awesome trolls, a dragon and a massive [[ASIN:B005MUAJTK Balor]]. They are not painted like the expensive miniatures, but you could paint them yourself if you wanted. They are very durable and extremely well-detailed.<br /><br />Also, the quests in this edition are better than the others. They feel more personal. You get to know the characters better (they are R.A. Salvatore's already well-establish characters (note:  I have not read his Drizzt stuff yet, so you still get to know the characters even if you haven't read his work)). The game feels more connected and less \\"go here, kill this guy, move on.\\"<br /><br />THE LESS GOOD<br />-------------<br />The previous 2 games had more solid cards. They were indisputably clear. Not so in this edition.<br /><br />During the 2nd or 3rd quest, we ran into a boss character's AI that was not clear. It said something similar to:  \\"If he is adjacent to only 1 hero, he attacks with a vampiric dagger. If he is more than 1 tile away, he approaches and attacks with a sword. If he is 2 tiles or more away, he moves 2 tiles closer.\\"<br /><br />What wasn't clear was what he would do if he was adjacent to more than 1 hero. He isn't more than 1 tile away, but he has more than 1 hero adjacent to him. Does he use the sword? Does he use the dagger? Is he scared and doesn't do anything? (that's what the goblin archers do -- it's not a ridiculous thought)<br /><br />The next quest we did, we had to kill a dragon. The dragon's AI did some weird things. You had to be on his tile to attack him. But there were areas where you could be adjacent to the dragon, the dragon couldn't go by you and you couldn't attack the dragon.<br /><br />As far as we could tell, the card didn't list if the dragon could fly over characters (we assumed it could). It didn't list what the dragon would do if there was no place for it to land (would it toss the characters aside so thatit had room? -- we assumed it would).<br /><br />It's not a major problem because everyong playing the game can just decide how to fill in the gaps. But it was somewhat annoying considering how perfect the AI was in the previous two games.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />-------<br />If you like dungeon hack-n-slash style of board games but don't want to invest the time that mammoth games like [[ASIN:1589942736 Descent Journeys in the Dark]] require, then this is where you need to go.<br /><br />These are my favorite hack-n-slash board games I've ever played.revious two games.

0765324857|2.0|Spoilers to the games and the book herein:  I seem to be in the minority here.  But let me start by saying that I while I really like BioShock, the games- I love Rapture, the city.  There is something so captivating to me about that city under the sea that I can't help myself but revisit it from time to time.  For this reason, I didn't find much to like about John Shirley's book of the same name.  The biggest flaw in this book, to me, is that I don't think the author gets what would make a man like Andrew Ryan tick.  And he therefore has no understanding of Rapture, the city created by Ryan.  At least, he doesn't understand it the same way I do.  The thing I find extremely admirable about the way the games handle Rapture and the ideas behind it: They neither fully support nor condemn them.  The subject is treated with such gravitas that the gamer/viewer can bring his own opinions and perspectives to the material and find resonance in the way it's handled in the games.  Not so in John Shirley's book.  Mr. Shirley seems to have nothing but contempt for the ideas behind Rapture, at least that is the impression I got from reading the book.  The cover shows a group of ritzy people dressed to the nines and having a swanky party in a golden age of opulance under the sea.  There is nothing in the text of the book that gives off any kind of positive energy.  It, instead, focuses on the poor people and the problems they have.  Not to say that the poor didn't exist in Rapture, and that their plight was a worthy story to tell- it certainly is.  But there is no counter balance which is what made Rapture so intriguing.    As I mentioned before, Mr. Shirley's presentation of Ryan seems to be at odds with the Ryan presented in the games.  Again, I draw the conclusion that Mr. Shirley doesn't understand a man like Ryan and has no respect for what he tried to do.  Ryan, from the games, had an extremely clear idea of what he wanted to accomplish and the tools he'd use to get there.  The Ryan from the book appears to be much more influenced by the things happening around him, which would be odd for a man who brought Rapture into existance by sheer force of will.  The first scene with Ryan when he decides to build a city under the sea is perhaps the most disturbingly wrong.  However, it is followed by an odd visit by Ryan to \\"his favourite musician\\"- one Sander Cohen.  We get to see Ryan cut loose for a few moments while he taps his toe to Cohen's latest masterpiece.  Really?  Is this what you expect Ryan was up to whilst he was simultaneously planning and building Rapture under the sea.  If you've played the BioShock games, and if you're still reading this review I hope you have, then you've heard most of the story that's presented in this book.  Mr. Shirley had to do his homework to understand the timeline into which all of BioShock's backstory fits.  Truthfully that was no small task, and filling in the gaps must have been a considerable effort as well.  But he seems to have missed the point.  As a big fan of the BioShock games, I conclude that reading this book didn't add to my enjoyment of the property at all.  All of the good stuff here is already in the games, and better presented to boot.  The book is readable, and I managed to finish it, so I can give it no less than 2 stars.  However, due to the other factors explained or summarized above, I can give it no more.

B005SV9X22|1.0|Let me start off by saying I do Love Gaga as a performer and at best a singer. She has a major talent factor that wows me every single time she sings. I think her talent for writing is brillant. I love a singer that never says anything straight out but rather has people always wondering \\"wow I wonder what this song means now\\"?  I saw her perform on this tour live twice. Two back to back nights. It was Fantastic! Her performance skills were jaw droppingly amazing! Her outfits awsome as usual and music track was great. She even features a song only able to be heard during her monster ball tour and nowhere else.   I give this concert dvd one star due to the way it was filmed. GOD AWFUL!!!!! Throught the entire dvd they were always focusing on the audience. Who wants to look at an audience while watching a concert dvd, especially knowing that it is Lady Gaga. We all want to see her outrageous outfits and how she performs. Let me say again I saw her perform live twice and the dvd shows no justice to her live performances. You hear more fan screams then her actually singing.  What ashame!!! What we have all been waiting for turned out awful due to bad video recording :(
B005HSG3TC|1.0|Very Disappointed.I bought because I am a school busdriver and I am sitting waiting on fieldtrips alot.I wanted it as a stand when watching a movie on my kindle,But the ridge on the back is not deep enough and any little movement and it falls down.Very annoying
B005Y423ZC|5.0|After watching both the 90 minute DVD concert and then listening to just the audio cd, I have to say I'm speechless.   Adele is just superb. The song arrangements, with the live orchestra makes her hits sound even better than the original studio versions. This is something I've never thought possible as I have always found concert cds somewhat lacking.   This is a must buy for Christmas as I can guarantee that you will play both the dvd and cd for many years afterwards.   I hope and pray that she has a long career and one day we can look back at this performance as the beginning of a true legend.

B0037KMHRY|5.0|When I went to see the movie, the thing that stuck out the most was the score. This is one of the best scores I have ever heard, and I do not own any Daft Punk, I don't listen to them, so the fanboy thing is cut off at root. I recommend checking out Alan Howarth scores from old john carpenter movies if you like Tron Legacy's score. Whether you do like it or not, these scores are very similar. Haunting, atmospheric, epic are only a few words to describe these kinds of scores. I hope Hollywood stands up and takes notice, abandons all these composers that all sound the same, and starts looking at the unconventional composers for film.
B005FJ7DOM|5.0|I happened to see adverts for this movie will searching the net for the vamp flix. I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie really was. The movie didn't rely on heavy dialogue. You could watch the story take place with visuals that were bone chilling and moving. The narration was good as it helped the movie in places.<br /><br />The movie is reminiscent of \\"28 Days Later\\" but with vampires and an American twist. If your a fan of Twilight or Dracula type vampires this isn't for you. However if you love vampires in every way and love to see new twists and turns in the genre and stories based around the myths as I do, then tune in and enjoy.
B005VR9328|5.0|i can not find the words to express this album. we all know that the roots are underrated and never disappoint.
B006JXDXZG|3.0|Why oh why, does everything have to get so treacly and cute on American TV? It's really nice to have an intelligent, complicated, somewhat frightening procedural drama without babies!!! Relationships aren't everything.  Little Baby Michael gets to meet his Grand Dad, and that subplot ruined the show. I'm glad that Angela and Hodges are thrilled with their baby, but I don't think he belongs at work. Baby and kiddie issues don't help this kind of drama. It's really annoying.  Does anyone ever watch BBC-TV's procedurals? Luther (Luther) doesn't have babies. Boyd (Waking the Dead) has a son, but the kid never shows up at work. In fact, the kid is missing. MI-5 has a little girl, but interactions with her aren't cutesy.  It seems that on American TV, shows sooner or later have to conform to some saccharine Perfect Little Family ideal, even if it shreds the dramatic composition of the show. Possibly the reason is that the corporations paying for the show are deathly afraid of any controversy and reality, and hogtie the creators. Unwittingly, they make a mess of the shows, people walk, and their very expensive ads go unseen.   I have always LOVED Bones, but I've about had it with the pregnancies and babies. I like gritty, snarky procedurals, like this one USED to be. Remember the Gravedigger series?? I was truly afraid of her. Max made me really nervous.  Now, it's all about sleep deprivation and child rearing theories. Too bad. I'm just going to go wait for Alice Morgan (Luther) to create more mayhem: great fun!!
B0028RXXE8|5.0|[[ASIN:B0028RXXE8 Rome: The Complete Series]]  At last - and it has taken quite a while too - a production from a U.S. based movie maker (HBO) which has NOT been sanitized by U.S. prudish attitudes  ...  A brilliant production in which HBO has excelled in its portrayal of ancient Rome.   Acting  - first class.  Costumes - first class.  Storyline - first class.  A production that for all intensive purposes follows historical records fairly closely.  The use of English actors and actresses was a smart move to say the least ... (somehow American accents just don't quite cut it).  The series follows the life and times of the Caesars starting with Julius and moving on to Octavian (Augustus). Then throw in the English styled sub-plot of two legionaries caught up in all the turmoil and you have the making of a great piece of viewing.  So will there be more we ask? There should be, and there are plenty of characters to follow up on.  Having read some of the earlier reviews - I'm a bit amazed that American reviewers don't think it is family entertainment - it certainly is family entertainment here in Australia. After all - we have had full frontal nudity at `prime time' since the early seventies - it is only the U.S. that feels `blood and guts' and `foul language' are ok but nudity is not. (No nudity please - we are American is the norm).  Having lived in the U.S. for some ten years or so, I've seen some amazing things in censorship such as a black woman's breasts openly shown on TV, while seconds later in the same production the white woman's breasts were scrambled. (Yes it still happens).  That to me is official `racists based' censorship - however that is not the case here in this production.  Then perhaps we should consider the source - just take a look at the Lincoln or Jefferson monument and you'll see some very Roman looking architecture, throw in a needle like Cleopatra's for George Washington just for good measure and you have it - the new empire of Rome ie:- the good ol' U.S.A. with the attitudes of the Puritans or the Vatican thrown in.  Even the military ex- service's clubs are named Legion No. ... - Rome still lives on but I digress.  HBO has gone the extra metre (yard) and produced a credible program which can be enjoyed by viewers all over the world - thank the gods for that. So watch it, enjoy it, and if you are American - watch it with your families - it's normal.   Well see for your self ...
B004FOA84A|3.0|Im glad i got this game with the free app of the day because its too short, its cute and fun but as soon as you get going and interested the game is over! it doesnt even take one hour to play the whole game!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This series is brilliant and beautifully cast. If there is one thing HBO is great at (at least 95% of the time) it's finding wonderful scripts. This miniseries was wonderful... very inspiring, dramatic, and even a little life-changing. Highly recommend!

B003L77GH4|4.0|I was not planning on watching this series, much less becoming a Vampire Diaries Junkie, but it happened.  I watched the first episode of the first season and had to watch the second, and so on.  I watched the first season in two nights and ordered the second season.  It was made for young adults and it's fascinating to see what these kids get up to.  As an adult you wonder vaguely how these kids can get away with all the stuff they manage to do...parties every weekend, parents aware of their kids drinking and doing drugs and doing nothing to stop it.  Short on parental supervision and long on self gratification. Under all that there are the mysteries involved behind the scenes of all the parties. You see that the parents are aware of the Vampires,and the witches and the werewolves. They are so involved in killing and keep the \\"evil\\" that they let it slip in unaware that they don't know everything.  Vampires that are good, and Vampires that are evil, and Vampires you think are evil and turn out not to be evil.  Vampires that can go out in the sun, but only because of talismans made by witches that have magic attached to them.<br />It's a fun romp through the supernatural. You have your whiny tortured vampire (this appears to be a per-requisite for this type of story, i.e. the whiny Vampire gets the girl) that is trying so hard to be good. Your evil vampire that isn't really evil but who is tortured because he loves the girl his brother has. Then you have the Girl.  The one they both love. (Oh why must they choose the whiny tortured vampire.) The two vampires are brothers.  This series has a bit of everything for everybody...Vampires, Witches and Werewolves.  Doppelgangers appears to be the main theme for season two as the \\"girl\\" is playing two parts.  One of a Vampire (self involved, all about me vampire), and the other the teenage girl that the brother vampires are in love with.  All this sounds very Soap Opera-ish, but this series manages to stay just clear of that.<br />It's fun, suspenseful, intense and takes the supernatural just beyond it's boundaries.  It's enjoyable.It's fun, suspenseful, intense and takes the supernatural just beyond it's boundaries.  It's enjoyable.
B00005N6KG|2.0|These headphones are just 'ok'. the sound is ok, but they are a little flimsy and don't stay in place very well. They are not what I was expecting. The price was cheap, so I guess you get what you pay for.
B005I6EU48|4.0|I love my cover for my Kindle Fire.  It looks and feels like an old volume of a book.  The only thing I would change is a place to put a stylus.  It fits inside along side the Kindle, but sometimes falls out.  I've tried clipping it on and it scratches up the outside of the cover.
0740797719|5.0|I'm self taught in the visual arts all the way since childhood, my only art education was from kindergarten to junior high. The rest was derived from self discipline, in-house R&D, etc., you get the picture. Never really got into art reference books until my journey into taking screen printing seriously and the light clicked on, now I have a smallish library spanning just about everything I've wanted to do and was already doing. This book right here is the example of what knowledge base you want your brain to access internally when utilizing the subject of \\" Color & Light\\". You may read several books or stacks on the same subjects with the idea of compiling what was learned into your own problem solving method, but you will always come right back to EXACTLY what this book does in a single volume. For the price they're asking here on Amazon, you'll blow that on a dinner date. Stay home with the chick, watch Netflix together with a PB&J sandwich for 1 night instead, then go get this book. Use it. Produce some work with the knowledge, sell the piece(s), then you guys can hop on a plane and go have a dinner date in Paris. Understand?
B00511ONPG|5.0|I really liked the book, the way it is organized is excellent and easy to read. It tells you why the traditional way of marketing is no longer effective and the marketers should be aware of these new ways of communications and utilize them to get engaged with their customers. Being likeable is the way to success and making more sales.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This show is a must see! The characters work really well together and I hope this show lasts a looong time!

B005N1E8A4|5.0|I've seen many pop acts including Britney and Madonna. I have Kylie Minogue three times. The first being on her For You, For Me Tour and Aphrodite Live twice Stateside. I was not fortunate enough to see Les Folies (the bigger Aphrodite Live set with the huge catwalks and water show, which only toured in Europe and Asia) but this 3D experience is the closest thing I'll get to it!  As a few other reviewers mentioned, the two discs are mislabeled! The disc that does not say 3D is in fact the 3D disc. I'm not sure what went wrong there. But the concert in 3D is spectacular! \\"Spectacular\\" might be a under statement because I can't put into words how incredible this show is, especially in 3D. You should know that I am not a big fan of 3D things but watching this on my 3D TV and my 3D glasses makes it one hell of an experience. Kylie Minogue proves herself as an ultimate pop icon and goddess! She doesn't need the huge success in North America to prove this.  Please note that if you don't have a 3D TV... the experience is phenomenal in 2D as well!
B005OOL1IC|1.0|the whole movie is shaking, the sound is fine, but the image keeps jumping throughout the movie. never had this problem before[[ASIN:B005OOL1IC The Hangover Part II (Movie-Only Edition + UltraViolet Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]]]

B001FB4VXU|5.0|I recently got into watching The Big Bang Theory when they started showing re-runs 5 days a week. It's a hilarious show and would recommend this to anybody who wants a good laugh!
B0055SWM08|5.0|An enjoyable game that is challenging, fun, and addictive. The graphics are good and the problem solving intriguing enough to keep me interested.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|Every year my husband and I look forward to sharing this movie at Christmas time. It is funny, sad, thoughtful, lighthearted fantasy but we love it!  The acting is exceptional and the music fantastical...There are enough different stories going on that everyone can relate to and it proves that love indeed, does conquer all.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great version...so many options and ways to control your experience. Can't believe it was free! Best choice by far.
B000001F26|5.0|I've always been an Eric Clapton fan. After listening to Timepieces at the YMCA while working out, I just had to have it.  It is really is \\"the best of Eric...\\" Now I listen to it all the time.
1451627289|5.0|This review is of the transaction not the book it's self.  The book was sent to my son at a different address than the billing address.  It was quickly shipped and was a very easy purchase.  He has told me he enjoyed the read.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|sexy, sexy, sexy! match the hauntingly beautiful voice of susan tedeschi with the precise and smooth guitar work of derek trucks and you get absolutely beautiful music. every song on this cd grabs your soul, takes you on a journey of ecstasy and does not release you until you realize the cd is over- at which point you have to then hit the \\"repeat\\" button on your cd player and start the comforting and insatiable cycle all over again. this is truly stunning music done the bluesy, southern rock way. as to genre, if you like the genius of eric clapton mixed with a little legendary bb king, a bluesy creedence, a pinch of skynard and legendary talent of the allman brothers band, then you'll definitely appreciate this cd too. this cd is a perfect performance of southern rock at its finest. this cd is so well worth the money. I personally guarantee that you will not have any buyer's regret with this purchase. trust me, you will play it so many times that it will come out \\"free\\" if you calculate price per \\"listen.\\" you should definitely buy this cd for the love of it, you will not be disappointed. it is a classic \\"must-have\\" for your music collection. Excellent!  p.s. at the very least download \\"Midnight in Harlem\\" it is exceptional.
B004A8ZWVK|3.0|I think this was a good movie but not a great movie.  While I feel that there were some great scenes and good acting, most notably  the character Minny, played by Octavia Spencer, the film really didn't measure up to the book.  The book at least had some detail and of course not all of that could be covered in a movie.  Also like a lot of books adapted to movies some of the elements are changed to make the outcome look better than it actually is, like what really happens to Skeeter's mom, played by Allison Janney.  Also I felt that most of the characters were flat--there was no dimension to them.  They were either mean spirited or kind.  Minny was the only one that showed any sort of emotion--she was outspoken, funny, and at the same time had a lot of compassion especially with her employer Celia, the \\"white trash\\" outcast who desperately needed a friend. If anyone should get an Oscar in this movie it should be Octavia Spencer.  My absolutely favorite film of the Civil Rights era was The Long Walk Home starring Sissy Spacek(Hilly's crazy mom!) and Whoopi Goldberg which deals with the Montgomery bus boycott.
0061452068|5.0|I've been doom and gloom since the financial crisis. This book changed my attitude.  I pulled my money out of the stock market in 2008 and have been on the sidelines until just recently. Pulling my money out when I did turned out to be a very good decision, but I've also lost out on growing my nest-egg because of my future outlook and negative sentiment toward the world-economy before I read this book.   Using history and science, Ridley showed me that the world is not likely to run out of food, urbanization is a good thing, it does make sense to specialize, and global warming (if it is happening) isn't necessarily a bad thing.   The Rational Optimist dispelled my pessimism by putting many of my common-day worries into the context of the evolution of the human social and economic systems. The conversation begins by describing how humanity captures innovation in its \\"collective brain\\" and shows how over time the collective continues to make progress and improve humanity's well-being despite all of the scary challenges.  This book convinced me to get back into the markets and I don't think the timing could have been better despite the what the gloom-mongers in the media are saying!
B0036T31YY|3.0|If you like Groundhog Day you will enjoy this movie....sorta the same old, same old....time and time again.  Would not watch again.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love. it I can listen to radio across the country and locally. its easy to navigate. I listen to it everyday
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Every season of soa has been unpredictable, funny, dramatic, surprising and brutal. Season 4 was no different. So much betrayal and once again you just can't predict what will happen next. The most members died this season including an original \\"Piney\\" which sucked but man did it set up for what will be a very bloody season 5. A lot of people complained about the finale not being crazy enough etc but come on, the finales won't always be like that. No one could of predicted that the cartel were cia agents the whole time which changed the whole future for Jax and Tara. Jax and Tara being at the head of the table at the end gave me chills especially when it flashed back to John and Gemma. This show to me is the greatest ever and not just in the story line but the music just sets the tone too from well known music to awesome unknown. Season 4 is my 2nd favorite season behind season 3 and season 5 is set up to be a huge war. It will be amazing just like every season has been. SOA4LIFE!
B0001GMIOE|5.0|I was very impressed with the speed if receiving this product. I would do business with this company again in a heart beet.

B001HN6918|3.0|\\"Your story may not have such a happy beginning, but that doesn't make you who you are. it is the rest of your story, who you choose to be... So, who are you, Panda?\\"  Po and his friends are back and this time they must stop an evil peacock from destroying kung-fu.  Po must learn to deal with his past in order to once again save China and the art form.  To me this movie and \\"Cars 2\\" both had the same problem.  Both were made as kids movies but with adult story lines.  The problem with that is the adult aspect of it is too watered down for adults to take and the rest is not childish enough for the kids to really enjoy.  I was never a fan of the first one but my kids were.  Watching this one we all thought it was kinda boring.  If they would have gone for more of Po hurting himself like the first one they would have liked it better.  Sequels to kids movies try to actually be different from the first one, and that's why so many fail.  Two and eight year olds don't care about stories they want up beat and funny, not a panda figuring out his past.  Overall, a kids movie that tried to be to adult and didn't work.  I give it a B-...my kids give it a B.
0765356147|5.0|I couldn't wait to finish this book - just so I could see what was going to happen to the characters I knew and loved.  Sanderson worked in so many twists and turns into this book in particular of the trilogy!  I was especially pleased that I was not able to guess how things would turn out.  I really liked some of Sanderson's work here with the theme of religion, while it was not overpowering or preachy I still really appreciated the message he was able to get across here.  I thought the side characters (not Vin and Elend) were featured much more in this book unlike book 2 ([[ASIN:0765356139 The Well of Ascension (Mistborn, Book 2)]]) which was nice.  I particularly liked Spook's development.  I felt like after reading this trilogy at a fairly quick rate, I truly cared about these characters, and I was pleased with the outcome of this book.  I can't wait for more in this series as Sanderson's world he has built here is to wonderful to give up on.  This book did not disappoint with the action, and there was much tension involved this time around - more than any of the other books in the trilogy.  Also, the locations were much more varied, which was nice as well.  A great book, I would recommend this one in a second (and have, already!)
1451627289|4.0|I've never been a really big Stephen King fan, though I have read a few of his books. At first, I was daunted by the sheer size of the tome (849 pages in hardcover) but quickly realized that it was a real page-turner, even for a slow reader like me. The time travel aspect of the story was handled very well and felt very believable. The idea that the past (or \\"time\\", or \\"God\\", or whatever the natural force is) does not want to be trifled with creates wonderful tension. The main characters are very likable and I felt close to them very quickly. I wanted them to succeed so I wanted to keep reading to see what happened. The ending of the book was not easily predictable and so the last 100 pages or so were a nice surprise.  King set up his plot so that he would have to write a longer book than one would really need to tell a good story. The time portal that is so central to the story takes the time traveler back to the same place and time in Autumn 1958, five years before the JFK assassination. I have no doubt that King could have written an equally compelling book with about 350 fewer pages if the portal sent one back to 1961, for instance. This means that there are several hundred pages of the main character's adventures doing things other than what is really central to the plot. Yes, these side plots were interesting and compelling but make little difference to the overall story arc. This is why I've knocked an otherwise excellent book down from 5 to 4 stars.
B00650SSWG|1.0|You know it's not a good sign when you keep wishing a movie would end already.  I cannot believe this drivel actually made it out of the movie studio.  No strings attached was so much better.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|I have the complete collection. I find that the story continues to get darker and  darker and less for children as it progresses. Disapointing at best.
B001F7MSFM|4.0|I liked this one even better than the first.  If you liked Pans Labyrinth, this has a very similar feel. A lot of good humor, cool characters, and fast action.
B004P29FSW|5.0|I was thrilled to receive \\"Tron: Legacy\\" in vinyl format for a gift.  The LPs are of fantastic quality, and though I'm not a Daft Punk fan, I absolutely love this record, especially the Adagio.  One thing to beware, though, if you buy the vinyl version: a code is enclosed for a free digital download of the mp3 album.  That's part of the reason I wanted it (it's awfully expensive, even if it is an import)...but when I went to the site and entered my code, I found I was not allowed to download the music because I live in the US.  Maybe there should be a disclaimer about that!!  But I am happy with the quality of this LP issue, and will treasure it anyway.
B000FBJF2I|5.0|I am not sure if I downloaded this or another Kindle edition, but my version was missing a few maps/plans and reproductions of letters. However, I am not sure if it had any bearing on my ability to identify the murder - I got the right answer, but it was more an instinctive guess than a logical deduction. My little grey cells are obviously not up to the standard of Poirot (although they are arguably no worse than those of the narrator Hastings). This book is quite literally vintage Agatha Christie - her first published novel ever - so if you have read any of her other books, but somehow missed this one, then you will know exactly what you can expect - a limited number of possible suspects, each of whom could be the villain until you assemble the clues and dismiss a few red herrings. Christie defined the genre, and this book defined Christie. What more could you ask for?
0385535139|5.0|This latest Grisham novel makes for a great read.  After being disappointed with The Associate as a tepid rehash of The Firm, I was relieved that his next novel, The Confession, while having elements of The Chamber,  turned out to be a superlative emotional thriller. It left no doubt Grisham is at his best in legal thrillers.  His latest offering, The Litigators, follow the same lines as the previous two releases. Again at times, I felt I had the deja vu of past novels like The Street Lawyer, The Appeal, The King of Torts, and The Runaway Jury, among others. But what makes this a pleasant reading is its pure the entertainment value derived from the naturally flowing twists and turns, not contrived nor forced.   While the previous novel The Confession had a serious approach to it, The Litigators is more light-hearted, more realistic sans the conspiracy theories that one finds ad nasueum. I also had a good laugh on many occasions, laughter that I savored when I read his yuletide novel - Skipping Christmas.   I recommend this to all. I can't wait for the movie version.
B000UR9T8C|4.0|I think this is my favorite of the Spiderman series.  I love Venom...although he wasn't as big as Venom should be and he didn't have a lot of tongue action going on, but still very awesome.  Sandman seemed to give up too easily but still very good movie overall.
B003EYVXUU|4.0|Recently vampires have come to us as highly romanticized teenagers where supernatural elements have become metaphors of the angst and alienation felt by teenagers as they try to come to terms with who they are. \\"Let Me In\\" takes the idea of the teenaged vampire and adds a little gritty realism to the mix and explores what it may be like when the girl next door is a vampire.<br /><br />\\"Let Me In\\" is based on the Swedish film and book, \\"Let the Right One In\\", while I hear the original is creepier and more subtle, but I didn't see the original so review is based only on my viewing of \\"Let Me In.\\"<br /><br />Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a loner, bullied and beaten up at school, at home he has violent fantasies that border on the early makings of a serial killer. When a girl his own age, Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz), moves into the apartment building next door, and he only sees her at night, he becomes intrigued with her and as they become friends, he discovers her secret that she is a vampire.<br /><br />\\"Let Me In\\" definitely goes in for a more subtle, creepier realistic horror than either a romanticized view or a strictly gore-fest of ever increasing bloody vampire kills, and this is not to say \\"Let Me In\\" doesn't have its moments, like when Abby attacks a police officer and Owen has a chilling choice to make. \\"Let Me In\\" walks the line of the vampire movie and a dark tale of love. This subtly is even more surprising because \\"Let Me In\\" was written and directed by Matt Reeves who directed \\"Cloverfield\\" which isn't very subtle.<br /><br />The DVD includes commentary with writer/director Matt Reeves, a behind the scenes documentary, \\"From the Inside: A Look at the Making of Let Me In\\", a featurette on the special effects, and deleted scenes.
0142419400|5.0|Anna and the French Kiss is such a fun, romantic read, whose pages are filled with quirky characters, steamy romance, just the right amount of humor and, of course, love. It tells the story of Anna, a teen forced to move to a boarding school in Paris, France her senior year by her father. Anna of course doesn't want to go, and can't wait until the year is over so she can move on toward her dream of becoming a film critic. But once she's there, fate takes over...and it shows Anna what her true path is.<br /><br />That path? Etienne St. Clair.<br /><br />Oh, St. Clair. He's dreamy. He's tall. He's hot. He has an accent. He showers Anna with attention. Basically, he's perfect. At least Anna thinks so, until she truly gets to know him. She quickly learns that he has his own personal demons to wrangle (mainly his dad), and that the overwhelming good looks he possesses are not the best thing about him. The two go on a journey of discovery in this book, taking the reader along for an enchanting ride. Set against the beautiful city of Paris (seriously, if Ms. Perkins has never been there, she is one heck of a great researcher!), Anna and the French Kiss is a love story at its finest.<br /><br />My Rating:<br /><br />I'm happy to give Anna and the French Kiss 5 stars, and urge you all to jump on this one and devour it like I did. Of course, seeing as how it's been out a whole year, I'm sure I'm one of the last few to do so! :)
B003L77GH4|5.0|i have been addicted to this show since the pilot episode- if you know a teenager who's really into this whole vampire fad, i highly recommend this tv series- very good plot. Action, comedy, romance, drama- has it all to keep you interested and hooked! Obviously you need the complete first season to watch, then get this one!

B0068TJLSY|2.0|There was plenty of buzz surrounding this movie, I was expecting alot after hitting the play button on my dvd player. What a huge dissapointment this one was. Super 8 left me with a been there done that feeling. It really is a hodge podge of other better movies. Another thing that bothered me was that super 8 Couldnt make up its mind of what audience it was geared towards, The kids in the movie swear like sailors and there are a few monster killings. On the other hand there is cheesy kid friendly sappiness sprinkled throughout,(espeacialy toward the end). Actually I would have rather seen a whole movie about kids in the 70s making a super 8 film with interesting character development and witty dialogue! scrap all the monster stuff.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game is so additive! I just got my kindle fire and I love it. I suggest getting the espn scorecenter app if you like sports and the weather channel app because you can instantly check the weather. angry birds is awesome.
B001L51RQE|5.0|Nice concert video on DVD, documentary feature, as well as two CDs of the concert in audio. That is some bang for the buck. The packaging is good, too. The discs are in individual plastic \\"cradles\\" (the clear type), so scratching is not an issue every time that you take them out. You definitely get an appreciation for how good Sting is, and the band plays a great show. If you are a Police fan of any level, or just like to collect quality concert DVDs, this is worth buying.<br /><br />NOTE: This appears to now be out of print, so my raving about the price may no longer make sense, but if you can track this down from a seller in the marketplace, go for it.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|The final Harry Potter films really wrap up the series nicely just like the books did. Obviously there are differences and the books are better overall but it was great to see it all on the screen too. This has been a great series for kids to grow up with. My kids are still too young for the last half of the series but it will be fun to go back and watch all of them again with them someday as they read the 7 books.
B0063GORYU|5.0|one of the best. I love to play it and keep   coming back for more.  I'm sure you would too.  give it a try.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|While I'm an adult and usually read adult fiction, the first 2 books in this series were very enjoyable...This final book was not. Far too many ridiculous plot turns and contrivances, far too many pages spent on a poorly executed love triange, far too much boring and tired introspection on Katniss' part. In short, the author really flubbed this one...but maybe if you're 12 yrs old and hooked into series, the faults won't be so glaring.

B0050SYS5A|1.0|I have little to say no one else has already said, other than the instructions for putting it on suck. It has already scratched the front of my kinect (not the lens, just the pretty part) and I like to keep my stuff in best possible condition. It doesn't track my movement right, and even when it opens my silhouette it is often broken and sporadic, I have a tiny room I play this in but with the zoom it has me go to areas that I don't have in my room, but the regular kinect without the zoom seems to let me stand where I need too, I have to stand a little further back, but it's worth it comparatively cause I can slowly scoot forward and still be tracked. So yeah, useless for me.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|When i first saw this music video, it was on a home theater shop. Demonstrating on 5.1 speaker system + big screen full hd projector, i was amazed, the sound quality was perfect, i feel like seating in the show it self. The artist were great, singing all time favorite songs from David Foster creation.<br /><br />If you own home theater set, try listening to Bocelli's track, you will be amazed how his voice flow into your speaker.<br /><br />Absolutely a must for music lover and one of best demo disc for your home theater set.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|Pretty funny computer animated film.  I really like these and think they are funny.  This one I laughed at a lot.  It reminds me of \\"Over the Hedge\\" and \\"Open Season\\", those kind of movies.  It was funny and definitely worth picking up.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This a great final movie to a wonderful series!  With this release I'm happy I can finally watch Part 1 & 2 together (Part 1 sold separately) - Part 1 is so sad that I just couldn't bring myself to watch it on dvd (saw it in the theater of course) until Part 2 was released.<br />As always, Amazon's packaging and shipping were great - it arrived on the day the movie was released on dvd.  Enjoy!
B005PTYOTE|4.0|I was a bit dissapointed to find out that the so called \\"Extreme Blu-Ray Trilogy\\" edition of the Mission Impossible films was nothing more than a repackaged original Blu-ray discs  . The specs and artwork of the discs are exactly the same as the ones previously released, the only change is that the BD case artwork is different as well as the box. If you already have the previous trilogy box set there is no need to \\"upgrade\\", or better say \\"downgrade\\", since M:I 3 only comes with 1 disc instead of 2 as the previous set.  If you never had them, go ahead, make the purchase, even better, Best Buy have them for $19.99 this week, and they include a $10 coupon for Ghost Protocol, so in essence you will end up spending only $10 for a 3-BD Box set. Not a bad deal.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|I think this was the best of the Harry Potter series, although I liked them all.  The sound and visual effects were great  [[ASIN:B001UV4XIS Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)]] I am sure that everyone will think this is an appropriate ending.
B0043GXYBO|2.0|I suppose what you need to do when you read this book is just try not to think too much about what's going on in the heads of the characters. It's a good premise, and at times I was sucked into the story, but ultimately I just didn't care what happened. Actually, I kept rooting for some of the characters to die. I will read the next one just to give it a solid try, but I suspect if you're over 15 you might not connect.
B0000CD5I6|3.0|Este album de 2003 es correcto y con canciones muy bien tocadas, algunas nuevas otras vueltas a grabar y empaquetadas como disco de Navidad quizas por contiene los temas regrabados \\"A Christmas song (Living in the past-1971)\\" y \\"Another Christmas Song (Rock Island-1989)\\".  Se trata de un disco totalmente acústico donde prácticamente no hay cabida ni para un sólo riff de guitarra eléctrica identificable. Notaa que es de los Tull por la flauta de Anderson.  No es un album esencial como tampoco lo son \\"Under Wraps\\" o \\"Dot-Com\\". Si eres fan esta bien pero si no lo eres deberías comenzar a oir a los Tull por los años 70.  Soy fan, tengo toda su discografía de estudio y en directo, >12 piratas de distintas décadas y varios DVD también de varias décadas, pero este trabajo no aporta nada nuevo pues los Tull ya tienen muchos y mejores temas acústicos editados durante su dilatada carrera.  Por lo tanto aunque éstos no estén mal no les puedo dar mas de 2 estrellas.  ¡¡ Ojala aportaran algo nuevo como en su dia aportaron temas como \\"Reasons for waiting\\", \\"Sossity; You're a Woman\\", \\"Wonder'ing again\\", \\"Life is a long song\\", \\"Ladies\\", \\"Coronah\\", \\"Salamander\\" o \\"Weathercock\\" entre muchos otros para poder darles mas estrellas !!
B000PMLFRA|4.0|I'm not one of those middle-aged malcontents who cries at every change George Lucas makes, but have a look at an actual new mistake in the first movie, Episode 4.  It seems George is so obsessed with changing and \\"improving\\" his landmark film, his crack technical crew removed a missing sound effect in the big final trench battle at the end of the movie.  Check out the 1:56:57 mark when Han Solo appears and fires at Vader's and his henchmen's ships.  One of the henchmen's ships flies to the left of the screen alongside the trench and there's a big explosion......well visually there's a big explosion, but no sound effect of the explosion.  Maybe Lucas intended it to be silent because he...uh...well...maybe his vision was that the sound of the explosion should be left to our imagination.  In any case, I didn't think the BluRay editions of these films, doted after and prepared with painstaking care, should have technical mistakes in them.  Look at the previous release of this film and the explosion is there in sound.  Ok, I guess I am one of those middle-aged malcontents who cries at every change George Lucas makes, but I didn't think he made blatant errors like this.  But the movie is still the coolest thing ever made.  I know- I'm conflicted!
B005KN5AES|5.0|Wow!!!! Mark Reale is the god of metal.  You have to check this album out and tell all your friends to BUY it.  I've been a fan since this band started and must have listened to Thundrsteel more than any album in my large collection.  This new album is going to be a hard one to eject...if ever.  Maybe when there's new Riot out. Mark, thank you so much for sticking with it a providing us with some of the best metal there ever was.

B00280LYIC|5.0|I dont care that they give an age range of 9-13 im 16 and I love hese books I started reading these when i was 12 and i dont care that I will be 19 by the time the heroes of olympus series ends i will still be reading these books!<br /><br />now that thats out of the way. This is one of the best book series I have ever read and i hve now read every one that is out of both the Percy jackson series and heroes of olympus and unlike many other series I have read I have yet to find a sour note.<br /><br />Now for this book alone I doubt the Harry Potter fans like myself have but to read the desription to see the paralells<br /><br />1. the self sacrificing hero who didnt know about his powers till he was 11 and has 2 best friends<br /><br /> 2. the genius girl who doesnt break rules unless nessecary and doesnt take nonsense<br /><br />3. the goofy, cowardly best friend who provides a sense of comic releif<br /><br />4. No matter how many times they are right nobody seems to beleive them<br /><br />5. the old, kid professor who is the only one who will beleive them<br /><br />6. The story only take places in the summer exactly opposite of Harry Potter which only takes place during the school year<br /><br />But even with all these simularities the percy jackson series cant help but feel original even though most of the adventures come from greek mythology I feel thats what also helps it feel fresh it takes things normally associated with ancient times and places them in a current, familiar atmosphere.<br /><br />the other nice thing about this series is the hysterical humor which The author is capable of placing even in the most tense of atmospheres. And i personally find percys thoughts the funniest of all.<br /><br />Even though the charcters feel somewhat borrowed they also feel completly original and fresh and also incredibly memorable. I never felt bored it never seemed to drag and it also never felt uninformative and this is one series that comes wih my highest recomendation.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is an ap which will make time be enjoyed.  especially when waiting for wife to shop this holiday season.
1594744769|2.0|I have never bought a book from Walmart before.  For that matter, I never even look.  But this strange and compelling cover was staring out at me from the mid-aisle display unit.  I paged through quickly, glancing at the pictures and reading a bit here and there.  It seemed too unique to pass by.  Unfortunately, though, as a novel, it did not cut it.  The pictures were fantastic, but the story was weak at best.  Not only is the book just a first in a series (something not apparent at the start) but it feels more like an introduction than a full-fledged tale in most places.  We spend page after page being introduced to these \\"peculiar\\" children as nothing develops in the actual plot.  By the time the plot really starts moving again, all the mystery and intrigue of the beginning has been thrown out the door for a cookie-cutter adventure tale.    This is a very easy read (I finished in in two days) but not something I'd recommend.  Pick it up at the store, glance through the pictures, and then put it back.
0525423656|5.0|I cannot wait for the third installment in this series.  This book kept the magic of the first book \\"Matched\\" and added to it.  Clearly there will be a third book in this series.  I was swept away into this book and loved it.
B005XT1XT0|4.0|Steel Panther is a sort of half serious parody of what 80's hard rock was all about lyrically. The lyrics are funny as hell and despite this they are very good musicians as well. I would say they hold their own with bands like Motley Crue and Cinderella. I was always a big fan of 80's hard rock and thrash so its right up my alley, for the most part.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Very rarely do I find an album where every single song is not only listenable, but just plain great. This is one of those rare albums, at least for me.
B000GH2YPG|5.0|What an incredible book! This novel has been on my list of books to read for years and I can't believe I didn't read it earlier! I'd feared it would be pretentious and filled with flowery language that would bore me to tears, but it was absolutely the opposite. This modern classic is the tale of a young bride haunted by the ghost of her husband's first wife, the gorgeous and perfect Rebecca de Winter. From the opening line, \\"Last night, I dreamt I went to Manderly again,\\" I was hooked. Du Maurier writes beautifully and her storyline is riveting. She includes sinister characters, a haunting tale, and shocking twists, all the ingredients for a page-turner. This novel is a must-read and I highly recommend it!
0385737424|5.0|I am a 13 year old girl who first read this when I was 12. This is my favorite book. This book involves deep mystery, great plot, and just enough romance to make it interesting. Talks lots about time traveling and 'tessering'. I would give it a 100 star rating if I could, I absolutely love this book
B001AGXEA6|5.0|this is a great movie! baldwin and keaton shine in this one! the bluray version of this looks cripsy clear!
B003Q6D1YW|5.0|The central character of this movie is a woman named Angela, who appears at first as the mother of an eight-year-old painter and of a beautiful late-teenage woman. Angela has since been interviewed by _20/20_, a well fact-checked tv show, and on that show she was exactly the character shown in CATFISH.  She's a poignant woman who can be laughed at or wept with, but is in any case precisely the person you come to know before CATFISH is over. The real life Angela and the Angela in CATFISH are identical.  The movie is about how a man who is flirting heavily with a woman he thinks is Angela's older daughter comes to find out the truth about Angela and her whole family -- a sad truth and, to make the point once again, a truth that has since been checked by professional news people. Some viewers have complained that the detective work the hero performs may have been faked. That doesn't matter. Others have complained that Angela's situation is predictable. Not entirely. By the end of the movie it is perfectly possible to sympathize with all of Angela's loves and deceits. Making her sympathetic is a hard task, and the moviemakers perform it admirably.   Apparently the trailer is misleading. This isn't a detective story with a lot of plot twists. Clever internet users (and that's most of us these days) will be able to see coming most of what the moviemakers find out. Not all. And the parts that can't be foreseen are often deeply moving.   Good movie, fundamentally truthful.

B003VANOFY|1.0|This headset would be great, if it worked wirelessly. Ever since I've had it I have had issues with wireless. At first, every once in a while, the sound would stop while the headset disconnects/re-connects to the receiver. After a couple months, it began to happen every 1 minute (or less). Logitech replaced the headset, but the new headset has the exact same issue. I've tried different computers (desktop/laptops), and even tried disabling my wireless router and other wireless (i.e., bluetooth) devices. The headset would still repeatedly disconnect!<br /><br />I'm guessing it could have something to do with the other wireless networks in my vicinity (apartment). So, if you plan to use this in a dorm, apartment, or somewhere with a more than a couple wireless networks of some kind, look elsewhere. If you're confident there isn't significant wireless interference, these headsets are probably good.<br /><br />I'm about to just throw it in the trash because it's so frustrating to pay so much for a device that doesn't work.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|This movie is outstanding. I was afraid the story might come through as \\"campy\\", but the delivery was great and extremely entertaining. It has the right mix of humor and involving plot to keep one interested throughout the film.
B004EPYZSK|2.0|I have always liked a good western.  I have always liked a good alien movie.  When I first saw this movie was coming out, I thought there could be no better premise for a film.<br /><br />But even though it had an all star production team and a strong cast, I think this film fell flat with all it tried to do.<br /><br />I am not going to go into what the film was supposed to do, but I think it failed as a western film, it failed as an alien film and probably was one of the biggest disappointments of the year.<br /><br />I rarely, if ever recommend NOT to purchase an item.  But you may wanna wait until it comes out on TV.
B0024FAR5M|4.0|I am really enjoying this show in the main - what's not to like? On the other hand, sometimes when I am watching them deal with crime scenes and such I think \\"That wouldn't fool a fellow biker, never mind a forensics team .. what the hell?\\" Then I find out it DOES fool fellow bikers and much respect is lost. LOL. That's the biggest problem with the show - the essential stupidity of the biker characters. I don't think it is meant to be tongue in cheek, so it is a little worrying that the main characters become a bit of a point and jeer spectacle. But then, maybe it IS tongue in cheek.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|Love this CD! It's been in our car for over 2 months now and we are still listening to it over and over! I haven't bought a CD in a looooong time and I am glad I splurged and bought this!
B005ZO5N1W|2.0|I knew there was a problem when I started liking the dogs better than the humans. This one just didn't do it for me, although the setting (Orcas Island) and the main character's job (canine search and rescue) seemed interesting. Nora Roberts has started becoming very predictable to me, and it seems that every 2 or 3 novels she pops out a male hero that is apparently her \\"type.\\" Moody, communication issues, and don't forget the perpetual five o-clock shadow and scraggly shoulder length hair. I didn't buy the romantic relationship at all, in fact didn't buy anything about the two main characters. And the villain, who should have been deliciously creepy, was blah and so.... \\"been there, done that.\\" I have really enjoyed Roberts' books in the past, but I'm just not finding any meaning or enjoyment in her newer ones. I really wanted to like this one! Sadly I didn't.
B005KDWUFA|1.0|I didn't like either of the cd's that I bought.  I found them boring.  When I buy cd's there is always a song on it that I especially love and want to play over and over.  On both IL Divo cd's this did not happen.  Disappointed...
1466208686|4.0|I'm not in a position to apply but to interview software engineers.

This is also a good book to know algorithms which (potential) software engineers should master.
B005V20JKI|1.0|The game itself is surprisingly fun and the graphics are great. As such, one would expect a lot of battery drain while playing. The big negative is that it continues to drain even after you close it, even if you go to app info and force close it. My phone usually drains from 100-91% when I leave it untouched overnight, last night it went from 100-61% and the battery stats said this app was why.
1400052181|5.0|Never in a million years could I, a well-educated middle-class white 30-something from the North, have imagined all that this family went through right here in the USA (and not even that long ago) had I not read this book! I learned about how race, poverty, and lack of education contributed to this heart-wrenching story.   Initially I read this book because I'm a scientist and felt that I should read it because researchers have relied on HeLa cells for so many projects and I wanted to know more about where the cells came from. I had heard there were injustices surrounding the \\"donor's\\" family and wanted to learn more. It took very little time for me to be totally captivated by the words on the page that I was reading it because of the story, the people in the story, their lives/experiences and not because I thought \\"I should\\" - I WANTED to because I'm human and so are the people in this book... It was so well written that everyone who reads this would likely be spellbound for different reasons based upon their own personal experiences prior to reading this book.   Physicians MUST read this because they are the people speaking with so many of us with lesser medical knowledge than they and it is their duty to fairly explain things to us and to present facts and options and be sure that we understand them. This book is likely not the only case ever where people didn't know what actually was going on medically with them or their family and maybe reading this will help physicians prevent such misconceptions/biases/confusion/etc in the future. Researchers should read this so that they can better appreciate the work they are doing and the contributions others have made. Anyone interested in bioethics or medical law, MUST READ this book. It so poignantly describes the many points in this family's lives that could have, and should have, been handled differently.
B0001Z37HM|3.0|This flick has been one of my guilty pleasures since I first saw it, and my memory of it is always better than the real thing, since I invariably mix in scenes from the second Schwarenegger Conan film, which was better than the first, and much better than this one. But, If you're an Arnold fan, this will warm your heart on a cold night.<br /><br />The story is threadbare, the scenery is dull, mostly rolling hills and caves. The special effects are adequate, but not special. And the most interesting characters are the ones who appear fourth and fifth on the bill, the Ninja prince of the conquered city, all 12 years of him, and his modest, seemingly inept servant (not so inept as it will show later). These two add whatever human interest there is to be found in the movie.<br /><br />I suggest it is not worth spending the extra money on Blu-Ray, and the DVD has no real extras to speak of (dubbing and trailer). If I did not look forward to watching this about once every two or three years, I would have given it two stars.<br /><br />It is fun the first time, but it has little staying power.

0385528752|5.0|Changing a team or a division or an organization can be like turning a battleship with a canoe paddle.  People resist change for various reasons.  Effective leaders understand these reasons and help others overcome them in order to cultivate positive change.<br /><br />Chip and Dan Heath's \\"Switch\\" builds upon Jonathan Haidt's work \\"The Happiness Hypothesis\\" by leveraging the analogy between a (rational) rider and an (emotional) elephant.  The rider (our rational, conscience mind) knows where he wants to go but must convince the elephant (emotional, often lazy, comfort-seeking, irrational unconscious mind).  You know you need to get up early to work out but it feels so good to lay in that warm bed so you hit the snooze...again.  Progress is only sustainable when the elephant also wants to go, when the rider and the elephant want the same thing.  This schizophrenic analogy is used, very effectively in my opinion, throughout the book to illustrate the point:  we must understand how our minds work before we can ever hope to change the minds of others.<br /><br />Emotional appeals are often more effective than conventional presentations.  Showing a room full of executives a bunch of charts and spreadsheets outlining operational inefficiencies may not get them to take a needed action.  Their elephants are asleep.  Showing them a big pile of work gloves where each costs a different amount and ordered from a different vendor speaks to them in a language their elephants can understand.  This message has a much higher likelihood of eliciting from those execs a much need procurement policy change.<br /><br />It is not all about motivating the elephant.  The rider also needs clear direction so that he can focus his intellectual resources most effectively.  What can look like resistance can often be a lack of clarity from leadership.  You may want your people to \\"get healthier\\" but you may need to give them a game plan they can follow.<br /><br />If you are in a leadership position, you may need to clear the path for those around you.  This involves doing what is within your power to create an environment in which your team can thrive.<br /><br />I am an IT Manager in the Aerospace industry and love learning about people and how they work.

031606792X|3.0|The biggest let down for me with Breaking Dawn was the author's avoidance in allowing us to experience Edward's and Bella's honeymoon sexuality.  I wanted to experience their intimacy, not in explicit terms that would violate the dignity of the characters, but in such a way that the characters might have talked their way through their first time together (whispers: Edward, \\"are you ok?\\" Bella \\"Yes\\" etc. There was a global avoidance of mention of primary sexual /reproductive organs that would demonstrate healthy arousal /sexual behavior, tenderness and thoughtfulness, thereby show casing the beauty of the sensuality between the two. (eg: The weight of him, shifting, or lifting a leg, settling into the rhythm of his body: absolutely nothing. I believe had the author done so, it would have allowed readers to feel the pleasure, and deeper fulfillment and connection between the two characters outside of the dramas and multiple tug of wars that surrounded them. Sex with Edward was such an important issue in the relationship for Bella.  Yet the author avoided their sexual intimacies completely as if she were unable to tactfully allow sensual touch, and sexual climax, as if her target audience would be immature children. Ultimately, the lack of sexual engagement between Edward and Bella is what was devastatingly disappointing to me.  It is a powerful story of love and family and I enjoyed the book immensely. I wish that it would never end.

0811875040|3.0|Great food photographs and easy to follow recipes. The scalloped pages are cute but not necessary. The confections are more fun to look at and buy at Miette than to prepare yourself. I was not inspired to put on an apron and roll up my sleeves. This said, it is a lovely book for the cook's shelf and makes a good gift.
B000QCS9NM|4.0|This book should come with a public notice. It is not for young kids or strict religious individuals that do not like to hear about drugs, sex, addiction, etc.  This book would be good for a closet pervert or a young adult that has no clue what a wild side means. LOL<br /><br />As for myself, I like a change of pace and I did enjoy this book. At times it was a bit more than what I wanted to visualize, but I can read tandem books.  The title was a very unusual word that drew me to this book.  And as I started to read I felt that the story line was pulling me in different directions. It was simular to a movie that has way too many flash backs and flash forwards. And then there is the brick wall that comes out of nowhere that stops right in your face.  Then you are left thinking, \\"What!? I read all this just to get to that!?\\"<br /><br />I am guessing the main thing you will get from this story is that we can all be a little crazy, gulible, weak, addictive, and urning for something some time in our lives. We are only human.

0393316041|5.0|My husband and I love Feynman's works and find this to be his best because of the personal yet humorist approach. He goes through his childhood success up to his later years describing some of his not so famous but very interesting tactics to success. I would suggest this to parents seeking out different methods to encourage thinking in their kids, also adults wanting a witty evening full of brain teasers, and any one interested in how the higher 'minds' think.

B005HSG3VK|3.0|I am happy with my purchase. It was in the condition and design listed and pictured. The texture or manufacturing maybe could have been described more but this was my first MicroShell purchased.  I rated a 3 because of two things: the fold back must be done carefully (otherwise the Kindle will fall back), and within 3 days of use the elastic band loosened(maybe adequate time has passed, but I believe it was too soon for it to show wear).  And within those 3 days I was careful and tactful in my use.
B004LPGI10|5.0|This is a 2011 reissue of \\"When Seconds Count\\" by AOR legends \\"Survivor\\", originally released in 1986. \\"When Seconds Count\\" was survivor's 6th studio album and the second featuring Jimi Jamison fronting the group. Jimi joins the established line up of guitarist Frankie Sullivan, keyboardist Jim Peterik, bassist Stephan Ellis and drummer Marc Drouba.<br /><br />Music-wise \\"When seconds count\\" was the ideal continuation of the preceding album \\"Vital Signs\\", further exploring their keyboard/vocal driven sound, delivering immense harmonies (in both instrumental and vocal departments). \\"When seconds count\\" features such highlights as \\"Rebel Son\\", the predictable but undeniably melodic \\"Is this love\\" and the majestic \\"Oceans\\".  One finds that in terms of both songwriting and performance, \\"Survivor\\" chose to challenge themselves by adding various musical twists and turns within the arrangements (whether that is an improvisation, a momentary alteration in tempo or a pause) making the end result all the more interesting and memorable.<br /><br />This particular reissue by \\"Rock Candy\\" records features the band's 1985 hit single \\"Burning Heart\\" (an international hit featured on the 1985 blockbuster Rocky IV) as a bonus since the track was originally available as a single, not included on any of their studio albums. Indeed \\"When seconds count\\" is a very well rounded re-issue of a classic American AOR album.
0446547654|3.0|My Thoughts: Oh come on, you know you have a soft spot for Nicholas Sparks, just like me. I love Nicholas Sparks books. I tend to read them as soon as they come out!<br /><br />The Best Of Me, was not the best of Sparks. It just wasn't. It didn't suck me and want to drown me in tears.<br /><br />We are introduced to Dawson and Amanda who were high school sweethearts. She is married now with three kids and he works on a rig, spending his nights alone. He spent some time in prison, never got married or had kids.<br /><br />They are brought back to their hometown to mourn the loss of their friend Tuck. Tuck had quite a lot in store for them. He purposely asked his lawyer to bring them back to town together to do him a favor.<br /><br />They see each other, and the feelings of course are still there. Amanda doesn't know how she will ever go back to her life knowing she still cares for him but she is married.<br /><br />Of course we still get the flashbacks (normal Sparks territory here). and I enjoyed reading all about them.<br /><br />The end of the book is where the real story is at. And Yes, its sad and heartbreaking.<br /><br />The Best Of Me, just didn't do it for me. I almost quit halfway through but I didn't let myself. I wanted to finish this book, and by the end I could tell it clearly wasn't Sparks best work but it also wasn't drop dead horrible either. I'd say this book is a 3 Cupcake book. I did read it, and enjoyed parts of it, but some of it was just hit or miss for me.<br /><br />Will I still go on to read his other books I haven't read? Yes. Will I read any new releases he writes? Of course.<br /><br />Overall: I liked the plot somewhat. Maybe because they were older and had already made their choices, I didn't like it as much as I had hoped. I mean, they spent the last 20 years without each other and than were reacquainted. I just didn't love this book like others. It left me with the same feeling that Nights In Rodanthe did. Also didn't truly love that book either.<br /><br />Cover: It's alright. It's kind of plain. It's too green for my taste. Not my favorite of his covers.<br /><br />What I'd Give It: 3/5 Cupcakes<br />_____________________________<br />Review Based On Hardcover Editionste. Not my favorite of his covers.

B005KJZDXK|3.0|I doubt that if Zooey wasn't already an established actress, she'd be able to launch a successful singing career on the merits of her voice alone. That being said, there are pleasures to be found in this collection of holiday favorites.  The music is low-key and the instrumentation is sparse and spare. This is holiday music to play at night while watching  log on the fire and sipping egg nog. The songs that work the best are the ones where M. Ward and Zooey harmonize, and/or share the vocals. Her voice, while pleasant, seems unfocused and untrained, and benefits from having another singer to play off of. She doesn't yet, and may never, have the chops and the discipline to carry a whole album by herself. More of M. Ward would have improved this album dramatically.  Zooey will never be Norah Jones, but still she doesn't embarrass herself either. The relaxed vibe of the music works well if that is what one is looking for in a holiday album. All in all, this would be a decent addition to a holiday music collection for those who would be open to its style and mellow charms, and tolerant of a talented, yet erratic, lead singer.
B005TBN3EU|2.0|The best thing about this movie was seeing Bradley Cooper walking around in shades and a loose button up. Only the best part was supposed to be the laughter. For me, the entire movie only had two scenes that literally made me burst out laughing. The rest fell so flat. The characters are annoying, not funny. The monkey played a better part. I hate to give bad reviews but I also hate to waste my money. I'd take Bradley Cooper in Limitless anyday. Another Hangover, not so much.
0374275637|5.0|For those lovers of recent psychology books written by Gladwell, Ariely, and others, you'll really enjoy this. Short, 3-6 page chapters on the ways in which our instincts override our rationality. Best I've read so far in this category.
1848378963|5.0|The book I ordered from Amazon arrived in the described condition. (It was new!) And the book arrived on schedule.  All went as expected with this order and I was very pleased!
1439190275|1.0|For health reasons, I switched from weight watchers, which had been really successful, to Atkins. I bought this book, read it thoroughly and started on the induction phase. As someone who doesn't cook I found this a really difficult switch. I lost only 2 lbs after two weeks in the induction phase. I stayed on Atkins for 1 month and didn't lose any additional weight, even though I followed the rules. The worse part is weight watchers had really taught me how to eat balanced and healthy meals but moving to Atkins ruined these lessons. Now I'm moving back to weight watchers but struggling more with the eating practices that I had embraced before Atkins. I think that if someone is going from no diet to Atkins, it may be successful but if you are already progressing well on another diet, the results may not turn out as you expect.
0596009208|5.0|This is the best Java book I've ever bought.<br />You'll learn Java quick and easily,because \\"It knows what our brain are thinking and how it deals with learning\\".<br /><br />This book use funny situations,explaining what we need to do,and then you just learn.<br /><br />A good book recommended for everyone who wants to learn Java,you'll learn it laughing all the time.
B005KJZDXK|1.0|I've listened to the whole CD...twice. I really wanted to like it, but it just got too depressing, the more I listen to it. The arrangements are awful and Zooey Deschanel's voice is devoid of emotions. The whole album made me dislike Christmas. So sorry I hated it.
B0041D843M|4.0|i like how there are a lot of facts in this book...by that i mean he states his research. even though he uses a lot of research, it doesn't read too bad. pretty well written.<br /><br />it is lengthy though. be prepared to have a lot of stuff thrown your way. also, if you aren't ready to be persuaded to go vegetarian or vegan, you might not want to read this book.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|Great product! I live in Germany so it takes a while for items to be shipped here. However, it came much faster than was estimated. Would recommend to others!
B000JQUZCI|5.0|the book is always good. the kindle translation was okay. due to the lack of traditional page numbers, i had trouble syncing it with what we needed for class. (i was reading it for a college english class). i ended up buying the one from the campus book store to make it easier. so, i didn't save any money. however, if you are reading this book to refresh yourself or are just interested in the classics, its wonderful.
1451648537|4.0|Absolutely fascinating - and horrifying. And this is the authorized biography! Steve Jobs may have been a design and marketing genius, but how his entourage suffered.   Isaacson does an excellent job on Jobs though there is a hole in the heart of the book as Jobs' adoptive (OK, he hated it when they were referred to like that) parents disappear from the story far too soon. Clara and Paul Jobs seem to be the only people Steve ever loved unconditionally and yet they are curiously absent from much of the book - the reader learns (in a few short sentences) that Clara died of cancer and Paul just disappears from the book despite Steve's insistence that Paul was \\"a great man\\".  Obviously, both had already died before Isaacson began his interviews, yet it would seem like these two (who must have loved their son not wisely, but too well) held the key to why Steve had such poor relationships with everyone else.  Nevertheless, a quick and very interesting read - my sympathy to anyone who ever came into contact with him! And my gratitude to him for his extraordinary and uncompromising vision.
1451648537|5.0|Great book, I really enjoyed all the history and details. I do wish there was more photos but thats ok.
B00622B3MY|2.0|It was nothing like the first movie.  This movie was way too violent to be rate G.  Guns, spies, killing... my kids should not have watched this.
B000XR4OC0|2.0|Tried some on.  Sure they are comfortable.  But really they are just cheap canvas materials and all made in China.  Considering a cost of $54 and inexpensive materials, can't they at least make them in the USA?  Even considering that they donate a pair to a child in need for every pair bought, their profit on these has to be HUGE.  Plus, I'd bet dollars to donuts that the pair they donate to a child in need is more durable construction that this delicate product.  If you want to help a child in need, buy a more durable brand for half the price and then donate $10 to Oxfam.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|This is a good quality case for the Kindle Fire and a decent price on sale.  This case provides good scratch protection but not much drop protection.  It does look very nice and comes in enough colors to cover my kids Kindle Fires.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a friend for Christmas. I'm very confident she'll love it. It's definitely the best film series of all time!
B005HSG3VK|2.0|I received this product several weeks after the original order of the Kindle Fire had been dispatched. Its an easy to use cover (as demonstrated by my 11 year old son). Hoewever once attached the kindle fire seemed heavy and cumbersome. It did not sit well on my desk as indicated. It kept falling down. I actually dont like it and am considering sending it back. I am using a plain generic Liz Clairborne tablet case and seems to work fine.
B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|This app is great. It brought back a lot of fun childhood memories from the 80's. It was an easy install on my Samsung Epic 4G.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps to play on fire.  Easy to use and responsive.  Good job!<br />Would definitely recommend
B004132HZS|5.0|Awesome adaptation, I really hope this series continues! Its fantastic and having been a Jeremy Brett / Granada series die hard fan, I was skeptical. but this is much better than the Downey versions. perfect, must watch if you love Holmes. This Holmes might even be more sarcastic than Dr. House ;)
B005L38QHA|5.0|First off, it really looks cool and the pulsing glow of the circular emblem is neat. The additional programmable buttons are definitely a plus for game play.  The only con for me is the mouse is corded; my personal preference is cordless.
B005CMSDKA|3.0|Make a boring action movie?  Well Joe Wright has. I didn't get a chance to see this movie at the theatre and caught a great deal on the blu ray on Black Thursday.    One can see where Wright tried to make a thought provoking movie about advanced science, spies, and the end product itself with under currents of fairy tale ideology. These ideas all sounds good but none of them translated well to the screen.  Note that I have not mentioned the action which is very good but isn't the movie.  I now own three Wright films I doubt that there will be a fourth.  There is no doubting his directorial skill but his movies at least Hanna and Pride and Prejudice had too-too many fast and/or jerky camera movements.  I'm sure it was probably a style tool but ineffective like most of this movie.    With powerhouse actors like Blanchett and Bana and Ronan one can only guess what could have been with a different script.
1451648537|3.0|You see this book everywhere, but I feel there could have been a better, more fair and unbiased look at one of such an influential individual.  Far from a saint, but truly an innovator, I hope this is the way we can remember him.  Not perfect, but definitely worthy of notice.<br /><br />Paul Buckner, author of:<br />Never Give Up: Book Two of the Finding Financial Freedom Series
0307593525|5.0|I wanted this set after reading My Life in France, the biography of Julia Child. While many of the recipes are overcomplicated and outdated I appreciate them after reading about the 10 years of effort and passion that went into just the first volume. I received them yesterday and already banged out the tomato sauce recipe on p. 78 of Volume 1. There are many more recipes I can't wait to try as well as some I won't touch. This is a great purchase for any fan of Child, or serious cook but otherwise might be worth passing up for something more modern.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|I am not sure why some people complains that it is not working. It simply worked just fine after the calibration. I used to move the chair and now I don't. It works just fine.
B0015DWJ8W|4.0|I enjoyed the book but I was expecting (maybe wrongly) more insight on the relationship between running an writting.  In spite of that, Murakami´s experience on endurance, concentration and the joy of running is one you can easily connect with, even if you are not a runner.  His description of his runner way of life can also encourage you to start to run as a real deal,or to return to your \\"left behind\\" routine of running.
0553386794|1.0|This book is written at the level of the young adult, yet lacks flow and originality. One quickly tires of the self-important over-written prose, and the back and forth between characters' points of view in each chapter. These are flat characters whose behavior is predictable and driven only by highly contrived and barely credible events.<br />Moreover, much of the novel is derivative, \\"borrowing\\" from other books which eclipse it entirely.  Don't bother reading this book.
B0050CJNJ2|4.0|I have not paid attention to this group as yet.......that is until I received it as a gift for my recent birthday.   I am here to tell you that I unsuspectingly became a big fan! The CD is very endearing with great melody and outstanding performance. I absolutely LOVE Hillary's voice. She is SO REAL and has just a gorgeous sound! Also this record is loaded with joy! By that I mean it just makes you feel great after you've listened to it. That is an ingredient sadly missing in a lot of today's recordings.  The only reason that this did not receive five stars from me is that the sound of the production is occasionally questionable. I would put this on whomever did the engineering and mixing. The levels sometimes send it into minor distortion as it gets super hot when their volume goes up and everyone's kickin' butt. Once in awhile there's too much stuff going on at the same time. That's it! Otherwise a five star effort for sure!  Great writing you guys! More, more!! Great band!
B00006J3WH|5.0|Season six of Buffy tVS is - imho - the best season of television ever. Once More, With Feeling is the best episode of that season. It is essential for all Buffy fans that they purchase this CD. To everyone else, you need to watch five and a quarter seasons of Buffy tVS so you understand the full amazing emotional impact of this incomparable musical episode. Epitomises all that was and still is wonderful about the series - grand narratives, indelible characters, powerful emotion.
B004HO6I2O|5.0|It's insane how people don't do any research before watching a movie or writing a review. Bateman and Reynolds took this movie because it was over the top, pushing the envelope Bateman said in an interview. This plot and the whole switching bodies has been done so many times. If you don't like nudity, vulgar language and obscene situations then don't watch this movie. I never write reviews but I couldn't stand to see how so many people were writing reviews saying there's too much cursing, nudity and so on. If you feel like that then this movie is clearly not for you and you shouldn't be watching it. It's RATED R for a reason, go watch The Smurfs or Grown Ups.  With that said this movie is hilarious, haven't seen a comedy like this in years. Throughout the whole film they were constantly pushing their boundaries which made it great. I'm tired of seeing the same limited comedies over and over. People are too easily offended and it's pathetic. I saw this in the theater and was hesitant because I thought it'd be another weak movie with predictable jokes. Loved it so much I had to buy the blu ray
1451627289|5.0|I have been a Stephen King fan since Salem's Lot but in the last few years have kind of fallen away. The concept of this book seemed interesting so I thought I would try again. I was hooked from the beginning. If I don't like the characters I won't read a book but I fell in love with these immediately.Although there isn't any traditional \\"horror\\" in the book there are supernatural elements. The book is about so much more than trying to go back and stop the Kennedy assassination though. It is about the changes that were coming to America in the early 60's. It is about the people and the attitudes, the nostalgia we have for those times now and the reality of those times, simpler times yes but not really more innocent times. It is (I think) about what we do or are willing to do for those we love, for better or worse....but at it's basic level it's a good story and a satisfying ride.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|This is one of the most hilarious sitcoms I have seen. There was a lot of controversy aout airing it, but the ratings did the trick and it aired and has been shown in re-runs in many countries.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|I wish someone had warned me that this piece of vulgar trash was a kinky horror movie, not at all what I was expecting, which was a classy engrossing story.  Rather, I found it to be revolting, disgusting & certainly not worth the time to watch.  If I want to see people vomiting I'll go to a local bar late @ night & hang out  in the bathroom.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I'm a fifteen-yo boy, who read and really liked the first Hunger Games books. The first was well written, had a good plot, and good character development. The second, which wasn't as good as the first, but still awesome, was the same way once you got over all the kissing which really wasn't that believable.  I read all of them in a matter of two weeks back to back. I was psyched about reading the last book, and was horribly dissapointed.   No character development, no clear plot, all violence. I didn't mind the violence that much in the previous two books, but there was a balance. In Mockingjay, it's just youwatching your favorites get slaughtered by the Capitol.  I'd say the worst part is that Katniss is no longer the girl who volunteered to save Prim. She's completely changed into some emotionless creature.  I give Mockingjay two stars instead of one because the first two books were great, and I can't rub off the whole series as a fail. This book sort of dims your love of the first two though.   If your like me, I'm going to write to Collins and tell her to re-write this instead of some prequel which will probably happen anyway.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I had no problem installing this app on my kindle fire. it works just fine and delivers the weather info as advertised with one exception. on the maps feature, there is a button that is supposed to pull up a radar image but it has never worked for me. I press the button and wait at least 30 seconds (more than enough time for the image to come up) but the image doesn't change from the regular road map. it would be nice to see how far away a rainstorm is but other than this problem this app is worth getting.

0545265355|5.0|First of all, I am a 41 year-old mother of four.  Though The Hunger Games trilogy is geared toward young adults, I enjoyed this series tremendously.  Both of my oldest sons read these books and they enjoyed them, as well. Because my sons are teens who enjoy warfare-type video games, I was curious as to how they would respond to this trilogy.  This series does not glorify violence; as a matter of fact, it challenges the reader to evaluate the rationale behind war and violence.  Katniss, the heroine of the series, is well-written and realized.  I often found myself wondering if the author had interviewed people who suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), as she captured the difficulties faced by those who have it.  I also thought that the arc of the story was realistic and unpredictable, even though the 'games' are a recurring plot device throughout all three novels (the third novel has a wider arena).    The author creates a wonderful landscape, using descriptive--but not poetic--language. It is a very visual book, and very action-packed.  That being said, her prose is elegant in that she does not go into too much detail, allowing the reader to fill in the blanks.  Mockingjay was a bit harder to read for me, as Peeta is not present in a great deal of the book.  Peeta, the male protagonist of the stories, is symbolic of hope.  Because 'hope' wasn't present for so much of this book, it was a much more bleak story than the previous two.  The greatest tribute to these books that I can offer is that after having read the series, they provided a great deal of conversation between my sons and I. It was so nice to discuss the themes and characters, as well as the emotions that the stories invoked in each of us.  I think that these books were a nice counterpoint to so much of the violent media offered to the young people of today.  My sons were able to reflect upon the psychological toll that violence has on the mind and heart.  I found myself thinking of Katniss,Peeta, and the other characters long after I'd finished the books.
1423140591|5.0|I have 100 pages left of this book and I already want book three.  What great escapism.  I can't believe I love these books as much as my teens.  i highly recommend this series.  Do yourself a favor and get the first Percy jackson series, this series, AND the Kane Chronicles.  Man!
0307888681|3.0|I had great hopes for this book - you are starting with a zombie apocalypse, it's written in a fresh format, and the author comes from an entertaining family.  In the end - I just couldn't suspend my disbelief enough as to how this became an epidemic. I don't care what nation this started in, if the outbreak of zombies happened so fast that you couldn't stem the tide, so would news of the outbreak. I could understand news being squashed but this would only be for the initial cases. Once it was large enough to be a threat, news would have spread also.  I thought the Battle of Yonkers was totally unrealistic and could not see how this could have been a disaster. As explained, many weapons would not \\"kill\\" a zombie but there are enough in the arsenal to eliminate their mobility so that the \\"fatal\\" head shot could be administered.  Additionally, zombies can crawl up an anchor chain but sit passively in a vehicle because they can't figure out a seat belt?  The idea was great, the style was promising, the execution was \\"meh.\\"
B004EPYZQ2|3.0|It's Spielberg, therefore we can expect ...  - Aliens (good. misunderstood)   - Children (wise, funny)  - Suspense (masterful, intriguing)  - Military (bad, always bad)  I liked the first 2/3 of the movie better than the last 1/3.  A bit corny at the end, IMHO. Also, the CGI train crash was not very realistic -- too cartoonish!  Spielberg purposely introduced a lot of blue glare lines and occasional spots & smudges on the lens (not the Super-8, but the big film cameras). I'm sure it was done as an after-effect to give the audience a sense of what filming was like during the Super-8 days, but frankly it was annoying!  If it showed up only on the brief Super-8 footage, it would have made more sense, but not on the high definition quality cameras used for most of the movie.  Enough with the blue lines across the screen already!!  Perhaps this is explained in the special features, but I hadn't gotten to those yet.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|This book started out extremely slow and I waited until over half way through the book for it to peek my interest. When it started to get really good, the book ended. Still rating 4/5 because I think it is a good lead for the third book.

B0053JJLLC|1.0|This just shows you what publishers will now do to make a buck.  Crichton is one of the most creative writers in history.  The publisher gets a hold of some notes after Michael Crichton Dies and says the book was his, tarnishing his name.    First the big publishing companies get together and introduce Illegal Price Fixing, and now they have done this - totally unreadable garbage!
B005PW3OS8|1.0|Vapid empty headed pap. Paid $3.99 to rent this while home sick and bored with everything I had on Netflix streaming. Now I feel embarrassed for contributing to this movie's success. I'm also embarrassed for the 124 people (as of writing this) that gave the movie 5 stars (4 star average with 277 reviews?). No wonder Hollywood shows no real inclination to worry about plot and character development. Just pack the movie with eye candy and CGI and the lemmings will march off to see it.
B005MIDE44|5.0|This album is one of the greatest hip hop albums ever made.  GZA's lyrics are solid and the flow is bone deep.  This album carries that classic Wu-Tang Clan sound you fell in love with.  This is arguably one of the best, if not the best, solo Wu-Tang albums.  If you haven't heard this album by now, you are truly missing out.  Give your ears a treat, pick up this album.

1401216676|5.0|This Novel was by far the best I have received from any Batman Novel before. To see how they managed to potray the Joker was indeed breath taking. Every page I turned kept me in sespence. Always looking forward to turn to the next page. The coloring and pencil drawing is just wow! No better Joker orgin then this one. This is why they call him the Clown prince of crime. Very sick to the core. Extreamly well pleased by this item. This is a book that keeps you wanting to go pick up and read it again and again.
B00650SSWG|1.0|Bad acting through the whole movie, boring, not worth $3.99 rental fee. Justin Timberlake is not a good actor in this movie.
B005LZW8FO|5.0|I've been a diehard fan of fantasy and science fiction since my elementary school days soon after I began to amass novels and short story collections in these genres I expanded my infatuation permitting it to influence my burgeoning love of cinema.  There is nothing unusual with this progression of events; I am one on millions that have undergone a similar progression and usually I can find some basis for understand any discrepancies between the general consensus and my own dissenting opinion. Then there are the instances when I think my fellow devotees of the genre are close to being bat guano crazy. A more than suitable example of this pertains to the general critique of the independent film `Another Earth'. The negative comments are almost exclusively pertain to one on the central plot devices use in the movie, as the title suggests the movie is set where scientists have discovered a duplicate earth drawing closer to our planet. This is employed as a backdrop for a moving story about a young woman's search for redemption. Critics are quick to point out the real world physics involved with a planet of equal mass move so close to our earth that it practically fills our sky. Yes, I full agree that this scenario is completely impossible. The planets' gravity would rip each other apart long before they annihilated each other with a cataclysmic crash into each other. Certainly the atmosphere, oceans and land masses would be destroyed not to mention the complete eradication of life on both worlds. This is undisputable from any scientific perspective. While I don't dispute these facts I do find issue with a little point here. The same Sci-Fi fans have no problems with a guy pitting on a little green ring and zipping off into outer space or werewolves and vampires fighting over a teenage girl but this departure from reality appears to stoke their ire. Guys, it is a literary device called allegory which by definition is an extended, symbolic us of a metaphor. The filmmakeris not presenting something fit cinematic art that uses imagery and sub text to relate an extremely emotionally driven, humanistic story to the audience.  Please take a hint from MST3K and relax and just sit back. This is a film to be experienced not subjected to a Myth busters like rational dissection.   Rhoda Williams (Brit Marling) is an exceptional girl with her entire life stretched out in front of her. Rhonda is very pretty and intelligent far in advance of her peers. One fateful night she goes out for an unusual night of drinking with her friends. This is not something habitual for Rhonda but this was a special occasion, her acceptance to MTI. The posters on her bedroom wall belie a touch of irony considering the focus of the illogically negative comments, is into astronomy. Considering the repudiation of the school a reasonable case can be made for her wanting to study astrophysics. In uncharacteristically stupid moments even the brightest teens are prone too, Rhonda gets behind the wheel of her car to drive home. She careens into a car containing John Burroughs (William Mapother), his pregnant wife and young son. John is gravely injured falling into a coma while his family is killed. Rhonda is convicted of felony drunk driving and as the film opens is being released on parole after serving several years in prison. Just as the accident was about to occur a news item is heard on the radio concerning the discovery of s duplicate of our earth in the distance heading towards us. During the time of Rhonda's incarceration Earth 2 has moved closer to us looming large in our sky. Rhonda's demeanor has collapsed into a flattened affect. Although qualified for any job available through her parole agent Rhonda wants to work as a custodian in her former high school. The position offers exactly what she wants most; minimal human contact and mind numbing routine tasks involving cleaning. This choice in occupation will soon be reinforced as to the deeper meaning it represents helping to provide the symbolic foundation of the piece. One day while returning home from work she sees Burroughs leaving a toy at the side of the road which was the site of that life altering moment. Rhonda wants to clear her ailing conscience by apologizing to him. She goes to his run down home and sees that he is living amidst a scattering of liquor bottles and prescription medication bottles.  Before Rhonda can Leave Burroughs opens the door. Unable to confess herself to him she blurts out a story about a trial free cleaning. He accepts and invites her in to clean his home. Totally unexpected by Rhonda he accepts the faux offer and hires her. Rhonda begins to go to Burroughs' home each week to clean his place. Slowly the two open up to each other. First a tentative friendship is formed with eventually leads to a sexual relationship finally culminating with a romance. Rhonda happens to hear about a contest to win a ticket to a privately financed mission to Earth 2. She wins and when she goes to tell Burroughs informs him about her culpability in the destruction of his family. It had known for awhile that the inhabitants of the new planet contains doppelgangers our inhabitants of our world. One theory arises that the synchronicity was broken when mutual discovery was made. Rhonda hoped that John's family may still be alive there and gives him her ticket.   This film is truly a work of art. It cannot be considered as a literally story but rather must be interpreted through the prism of the images used to elaborate the themes explored. The most important has to be personal redemption. In many ways there is a mirroring in the emotional state of John and Rhonda that is visually symbolized a=by the appearance of the duplicate planet.  John not only lost his family due to the incident he could no longer peruse his successful career as a conductor, composer and professor. The loss of this career also removed the means for of expression has always provided. In a similar light Rhonda's bright future was destroyed by that single tragic bad decision. At one point the prospect of exploring a new planet first hand would have filled her with elation. But it was a desperate move to find an alternate reality. Her need to cleanse herself is manifested through her propensity for cleaning places outside her home. She needed to scrub the world around her to try to return order to his chaotic life. Besides the overt symbolism afforded by the planet hanging in our sky the filmmaker Mike Cahill employs several, subtle visual leitmotifs to establish the emotionally intense mood of the story. While her life is in a disarray of emotions Rhonda dehumanizes herself with a wool cap and unisex overalls. This not only hides her identity reinforcing herself imposed isolation but she conceals her gender denying her young womanhood. Reflecting this in his own fashion John habitually wears a watch cap masking his self expression. Once their relationship begins to blossom the cap comes off and Rhonda begins to wear dresses in cheerful patterns. One theme that is nicely visualized is the disruption of their lives into a chaos. This is wonderfully visualized by the abundance of dust particles that swarm in the air as Rhonda cleans her room and John's home. They fill the air just as this once accident obfuscated the lives of Rhonda and John. This is particularly noticeable with the high definition version of the film.   Aspects of this film reminded me of the Mumblecore movement in independent film. While it does not conform exactly to all the defining aspects of this style there is the strong sense of naturalism through use of realistic settings and props. The leading lady, Brit Marling, co wrote the film and is a director herself. This is a team consisting of relatively new filmmakers in Ms Marling and Mr. Cahill so if this represents how the start their careers I greatly anticipate watching them mature in their crafts.  The movie is touching with an economic use of dialogue. The words hold significance here but it is the emotional impact of the stunning cinematography employed here. you do not watch this film; you experience it submitting to full immersion in its beauty.

1400156866|3.0|Tantor Media ordinarily produces superb quality audio books -- for example, the Pride and Prejudice recording.  However, Tantor's choice of recording artist for Persuasion coupled with overly-long chapters, falls way short of the kind of recording that Jane Austen deserves.  This review is not about the novel, which I think is lovely, if not superlative, like Pride and Prejudice or Emma.  The recording artist speaks Anne Elliott's parts in an almost-whisper with a slow cadence -- almost like a young schoolgirl's voice.  This is not only contrary to the character, who is strong and smart, but is really ridiculous!  Anne is an adult and should speak in an adult voice.  Also, the artist over-enunciates long and complicated words -- as though she is seeing them for the first time.  Therefore, the recording as a whole lacks the smoothness and polish that Austen's writing provides.  As for the chapters, Tantor cheapens the MP3 recording by having one track per Austen chapter, which means that some of the climactic chapters are well over 30 minutes long.  If one wants to back up and listen to a missed line -- say when driving -- one has to listen to the whole of the chapter (at least that is how my car's MP3 player functions).  If Tantor wanted to produce a more user-friendly production, the tracking would be every 5-10 minutes at most.  So overall, a disappointing production of a lovely novel.  Even so, I have listened to this audio books at least three times so far, and probably will again.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|First off, I'm from Dallas. I'm a Mavs fan. And, I'm a Mark Cuban fan so I'm biased, but so what.  This is a good read for anyone who asks, and everyone has, \\"How'd they do it.\\".  Mark Cuban explains it, albeit in a condensed version but again, so what.  It's only $2.50 and comes straight from him (read his blogs).   He gives the bullet-points that anyone in sales has probably heard already but says it like your friend would tell you, not some pompous sales-trainer that your company hired to waste your time (and make get pissed off at your boss because of it).  This e-book is a quick read and well worth the money spent.  I'd recommend it to a friend or family member (as it was recommended to me... by my Mom, Thanks Mom), and I'll be first in the e-line for the next one.  Thanks and Go Mavs!

0801896940|4.0|The book starts with an analysis about the Eulero-Lagrange theory. The two theories are similar and the back-ground  related is the same. The intuition is to write the differential equation as integral equation. Next this fact we can tell that the Noether theorem is equivalent to Eulero-Lagrange, if we have a condition of extramality for the integral and therefore an invariance condition. The applications most important are in physics and economics.
0811875040|1.0|I am very disappointed in this book.  After not being able to use the book for months because of errors in the recipes, the first recipe I tried after receiving the replacement copy was a flop!!  This is just a pretty book with no real substance!!! The one star is for the lovely look of the book with its scallop edged pages.
B004UFEJW6|5.0|This is my favorite action movie simply because it does not idolize the main character as being everything to everyone (e.g. funny + lethal + ladies man + computer hacker + great cook).   No, this movie is about a soldier trained from birth and how he does not fit in with the normal society. To make things worse, he and his comrades are about to become obsolete by newer soldiers. The sum of these emotional events would cut me to the core, and behind Kurt Russell's quiet and serious demeanor, you can feel his pain and his desire for payback.   The fight sequence sound effects are great, with bassy thuds for each impact. There are a lot of clever stealth attacks to enjoy as well.

B006BXTOFC|3.0|I was hoping for more of a Thickfreakness-type album (selfish, yes, but I love that album).  What I heard could best be described as \\"Popfreakness\\".  Maybe it will grow on me, but I doubt I'll give it a chance.  All I can say is preview all of the songs prior to purchasing.  I don't know how else to describe it, but it just sounds over-produced in comparison to their older, more raw and unrefined sound that I prefer.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm so throughly impressed by this series! I read all three in 5 days, and yes I work a full time job :) I could not put this down! I was moved literally to tears toward the end of this third book. I can only hope that Suzanne Collins continues this style for her next book(s). Worth every second of your time!!

B0058WFO06|5.0|Wilson's first solo effort, Insurgentes, was great. This one far surpasses it.<br /><br />A lot of Steve Wilson's music is reminiscent of the great Progressive Rock bands of the 1970s, but he is able to move beyond the genre and make something all his own out of it. Grace for Drowning is like that - I hear strains of Pink Floyd, Yes, Tangerine Dream, and even Frank Zappa, but you have to take this album as a whole. It should be listened to straight through, in a single sitting, in a setting where you will not be interrupted. It gets better with every listening, and it's so good I feel a little bit like crying when the last track is over. The only other album that ever made me feel that way was Yes's Close to the Edge.

0446547654|2.0|I was so disappointed in this book. Having savored \\"The Notebook\\" and a number of Nicholas Spark's other novels, I expected to be swept up in another classic, historic Southern romance. I did not at all expect the chilling venom or shocking violence that underlay this story. I never would have bought it had that been disclosed. Likewise, I was deeply disappointed in Amanda as the lead character besides Dawson. She was not well developed and seemed entirely dull and nondescript. Only her family struggles were somewhat reasonably described. And the ending was too trite to believe.

B00005R2IS|1.0|I am a huge Mad Max fan, so when I found this copy I was really happy (it's hard to find in store) I waited for it to get delivered and sat down with the partner to watch, only I was so disappointed when it was finished as they have cut out half of the original movie!!!<br />Majority of the major scenes are no where to be seen!!<br />I must admit this is the first time I have been let down by Amazon, but with such a classic movie (with the correct rating) why was there any reason to cut out soooooo much of it, for a person who may not have seen this before, they would have no real idea as to what the movie is!!!
B001F290E4|2.0|Love the original stuff by Seal, but this is walk in the park versions of old classics....more of what I expect out of Rod Stewart who is WAY older than Seal.  It's not even \\"soulful\\" when you get down to it. Probably won't listen to this CD again.

B000001FLE|5.0|How can this really be bad with the line up here and the songs. OK...so there are too many musicians playing at once but so what. My only complaint is the sound quality but then again it's live..it's 1973.. and there is alot going on all at the same time. Great Blues rock album. One hint- ya gotta play it loud or it just sounds wrong.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|I have never been a fan of Hugh Grant, not liked anything prior to this video. He did a great job of this one.  I will not remember him for anything else now. Loved the pairing of Emma and Rick again.  They play off each other wonderfully.  Have seen them together in a few other films but this one is ideal.  Liam Neeson and the beautiful little guy that plays his step-son are my favorites, their relationship is the best, under the circumstances.  Colin Firth will steal your heart. (Secretly he is my boyfriend-he doesn't know it) The music is darn good. Saving the best for last, Bill Nighy-Played his role of a lifetime...He has done a lot over the years, but I hope he will be remembered for this role.  Enjoy this movie and watch it over and over.

B004EPZ06Q|1.0|I enjoyed buying the BluRay + DVD + iTunes digital copy versions of movies.  Mainly wanted the iTunes version, getting the BluRay disc was just an added bonus.  If I can't play the movie on AppleTV or iOS devices, it is useless to me.  Guess I'll just have to buy the digital only versions from iTunes.  Oh yeah, saw the movie in the theater, pretty funny.

1933492929|4.0|If you like animals, prehistoric fauna or fantasy creatures, this book is going to blow your mind up.  Terryl Whitlatch's knowledge of animal anatomy is simply outstanding and when you put this together with her extraordinary talent for illustration, the result is a book you never get tired to flip through its pages.    Some of the silly characters in this book are my least favorite of her creations, and this is why I am not rating this book with five stars; however I still I admire the consistent anatomy and the rich, talented imagination behind even these goofy creatures.  If you are an artist or an illustrator with a taste for animals, you will enjoy a lot Terryl's detailed studies of many animals you already know and many others you haven't dreamed about yet.

B005M4K94G|5.0|This is yet another good sounding audiophile-grade remaster from Audio Fidelity.   Allways when a new Mobile fidelity CD is launched the complaining begins.  All they are are self-important bitter lackies who are uneducated about HD, or players and receivers and what it takes to actually play AND hear high-definition audio, so obviously their opinion doesn't mean quat.  Ignore the ignorant ones who do nothing but complain. They feel they have been slighted by Steve or Marshall (at Audio Fidelity) in some way on the Forum so they take it out by bashing AF's discs. They are wannbe engineers and so they are mad when they can't get noticed by REAL ones.   It's pretty pathetic when all you can do is complain and never enjoy the small things in life.   ==== PLEASE NOTE THIS ABOUT HDCD:   Buy the disc ONLY if you have an HDCD compatible player AND receiver, otherwise you WILL NOT hear the quality.   Your disc player MUST at least output 24bit/48kHz audio. Just because a player plays the disc means nothing. Most players convert ALL CDs to 16bit/44.1kHz for output. It is the standard circuitry of CD players. So... that is what your HDCD will play as, a regular CD. A regular digitally remastered CD would be better for you to buy.   AND.... EVEN IF YOU HAVE A PLAYER THAT PLAYS HDCD your receiver (or pre-amp) MUST have the ability to pass that HD audio signal through to the outputs and NOT first convert it to 16bit/44.1kHz standard resolution as most receivers and pre-amps do due to an internal digital converter.   You need a receiver or pre-amp that High Definition compatible and will pass the 24bit/48kHz (at least) audio signal through to the output. ONLY then will you hear the disc as it is meant to sound like.   ALL of my Audio Fidelity discs sound wonderful. Rich, transparent, deep, and full.  I know that all of the bad comments are from bitterness and/or anger at Steve Hoffman, Or Marshall and are retaliatory in nature... because not ONE of the discs sounds bad.   And I am one VERY picky audiophile with a massive collection .  Rafael says that he is a huge fan of Mobile Fidelity editions. How many does he actually own?  I have 46 Mobile Fidelity editions, 15 SACD hybrid, 54 SHMCD and 15 Blue-spec.  Please, give us more Mobile fidelity CD:s
B002JVWR9U|4.0|This series is interesting and entertaining for multiple reasons. I'll give the good first then the areas lacking without trying to give away any direct plots.  The setting is decent enough and the sets are more than adequate, but where the series scores is in the depth of the young acting talent coupled to the historical tie-ins that become more pronounced as time rolls on.  The umbrella story is timeless, boy meets girl and relationship has issues.  That said the interweaves get better as the series progresses, by the end of the second DVD the personalities are really beginning to emerge. It improves.  The dynamic and story between two of the rather timeless principles is a difficult aspect of the series that is well portrayed.  The downside is that there's a little too much teen girl drama for my tastes, but it can't really be described as completely over the top. The atomosphere in the series was decidedly \\"made for TV\\" but still really enjoyable for all that.  If you're into this genere at all it's probably best described as a bit better than an average investment.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the first book, Hunger Games, almost by accident.  I clicked the wrong book and there it was on my kindle.  It only took a few pages before I was hooked.

B005COO1X6|3.0|My thought is that this book was probably meant to be included in one of the short story books but probably left out because of room, size... whatever. Dig it out, polish it up, make some changes to bring it into the modern era (cell phones, ipads, etc.) then sell it as a Kindle book. Why not?  I enjoyed reading it, but like someone else here stated, the ending was a little rushed. I finished it thinking, \\"Well... what was it?\\", \\"Where did it come from?\\", and \\"Where did it go?\\"  I was a little disappointed.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|There's a great line in this 2011 dramedy spoken in a voiceover by the protagonist: \\"Give your children enough money to do something but not so much that they do nothing.\\" I'm not sure if that came from author Kaui Hart Hemmings' source novel or from director/co-screenwriter Alexander Payne's pen. Regardless, it's hard to believe Payne hasn't directed a full-length feature since the acclaimed [[ASIN:B0007TKOAA Sideways]] in 2004, as this 2011 dramedy most definitely bears his signature approach in focusing on a core set of flawed characters with a deft seriocomic hand. Although the movie is not quite at the level of [[ASIN:B0007TKOAA Sideways]] in shaggily mixing humor with pathos, it does boast a strong performance from George Clooney as Matt King, a wealthy O'ahu-based lawyer with Hawaiian blood, who finds himself in the enviable position of being the sole trustee of 25,000 acres of untouched land on Kaua'i. Dictated by state law, he is just about to get his extended family of cousins to reach consensus on selling the land to a native developer when tragedy strikes.<br /><br />Co-written by Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, the main narrative revolves around a boating accident that puts Matt's wife Elizabeth into a coma. This tragedy highlights the fact that King, a workaholic by nature, has distanced himself from his two daughters, ten-year-old Scottie and 17-year-old Alex. Suddenly, he discovers he needs to step forward and confront Scottie's bullying at school and Alex's rebellious hostility. When it becomes clear to him that Elizabeth will never recover, he tells Alex they need to visit family members to give them an opportunity to say goodbye. The strenuously resistant Alex surprises him by sharing that she caught her mother having an affair before the accident. This starts a family journey that gives way to revelations and confrontations which allow him to acknowledge his own failures and make peace with what the future will bring. On the surface, the story sounds like it will turn into a straight-ahead tearjerker, but thanks to Payne's discretion, the emotions the characters express and the situations they face are far more disheveled than that and consequently more compelling.<br /><br />It's not that Clooney does anything that takes him that far away from his usual screen persona here. Rather, he backseats his trademark coolness to convey a deeper level of vulnerability and confusion as a man unprepared for single parenthood. As Alex, Shailene Woodley gives a terrifically nuanced performance traversing easily between unbridled insolence and supportive nurturing. Amara Miller provides the right level of precocious honesty in her moments as Scottie. The rest of the cast makes less of an impression, for instance, Robert Forster as Matt's highly coiled father-in-law and Judy Greer as the unsuspecting wife of the realtor who had the affair with Elizabeth. The one fly in the ointment is Nick Krause, who appears to serve purely as a comic plot device as Alex's stoner-dude pal Sid. This character is the one major misstep in Payne's treatment. On the upside, cinematographer Phedon Papamichael captures the Hawaiian locations with greater variety than you would expect, and the soundtrack uses purely Hawaiian music to great effect. This is worthwhile viewing mostly for Clooney's work.t will turn into a straight-ahead tearjerker, but thanks to Payne's discretion, the emotions the characters express and the situations they face are far more disheveled than that and consequently more compelling.

Has every quest you may come across in the game helpful tips on character creation, weapon creation, and all the other things you can do in Skyrim. I would recommend to have a table, nightstand, or something sturdy to set it on to make it easier to read. I really enjoy the more detailed map that came with at all and for the price that they have Amazon, you won't find it anywhere cheaper!!
0312853238|5.0|I've been reading science fiction since the 1970's. Up to this point my favorite science fiction novel was \\"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\\", by Heinlein (you should read this book, too). I kept seeing \\"Ender's Game\\" near the top of SF book lists, so I read the summaries. Frankly, it didn't sound that interesting to me. Almost a kid's book? Aliens attacking? It sounded pretty pulpy. But after seeing it mentioned so much on so many lists, I finally broke down and read it a few years ago.  This book blew me away. It was nothing that I expected. Since I don't particularly like reviews that just go over the plot, I'll tell you why this was a great novel (to me):  1 - Very easy to read, yet deep meanings  2 - Strong, poignant characters and character development. Much more character development than most SF.  3 - I like stories with surprises. Major plot twists that will make you think; sometimes even blow your mind. Ender's Game has not just one, but two major surprises that are excellent.  4 - Gripping. Definitely one of those novels that you can't put down until you've finished.  I've read reviews of this book(in the minority) of people who can't see it - who think this novel is no big deal. Some people are more thoughtful and react more to \\"big ideas\\". For those people, this is an excellent novel. For those not in that camp, I can see why Ender's Game might seem fairly ordinary. For those that see a little farther out, it's a GREAT read.  Other SF I've read with great plot twists: Rendezvous with Rama (Clarke), previously mentioned Moon is a Harsh Mistress by Heinlein, the original Foundation trilogy by Issac Asimov, and Contact, by the late Carl Sagan.
B003YOZNBU|3.0|Jonah Hex was a pretty good movie not really D.C Comic or Superhero comic book classic but it was alright.
B004EPYZSU|2.0|Let me start by saying this isn't a \\"bad\\" movie. About 20 minutes into this movie, I was thinking \\"wow... this could turn out to be a great movie.\\" but then it wasn't.   I wasn't looking for some dramatic movie with an amazing plot, I went for just a good action flick.  The premise of the story is pretty weak to begin with, but that can be overcome with great dialog and great actors...  I love Wilde, Craig and Harrison, but they were just average in this film. Never felt a connection with the other actors either, when characters died, I felt nothing. I love great action sequences, but while the effects were good (though the actual aliens were rather cheesy), nothing was spectacular.   The dialog is definitely the weakest part of the movie. There are certain places in a movie where you just KNOW this is a place for a great line that makes you laugh or cry, but this movie didn't deliver. I found myself saying \\"Really? That was the line they went with there?\\"  If you go into this movie with no expectations of it being great, you will probably leave saying \\"that was... good... I guess\\", but how can you expect a movie starring Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig to be simply average? Expectation of greatness is a given and this movie is just \\"ok\\".

B003Y5H4Y8|1.0|In short - this movie should have been about an hour long.  WAY too much fluff that did not really contribute.  The debth of the movie is GREAT, the premis is fantastic, but it DRAAAAGGGGGGGGSS on so, to be honest I had to run back the last 15 min to find out what happened in the end because I fell asleep - and that was the best part of the whole movie.  David's suicide still has me confused - yes I understand he was troubled about the lying and had spent most of his life trying to correct it, but more must have been wrong with his life to have him end it like that, very unsatisfactory.

0385732554|5.0|It would be odd wouldn't it to live in a world where everything was worked out for us? Sure, it would have its benefits, there'd be no tough choices to make, there'd be peace all the time, and hey, maybe it's a great idea and we are on our way already. Jonas, an eleven year old, lives in such a place. He lives with his parents who were picked out for him and so does his little sister. They live practical lives and never insult or attempt on purpose to say anything thoughtless. When kids get to be Twelves, their occupations are chosen and they are set to obtain appropriate training such as caring for the elderly who live in a special building and live their remaining days in comfort until they are 'released.' Even babies are raised in special nurseries where people are assigned to work and care for kids until they are old enough to go to a family unit. Things change for Jonas when he is assigned the job to take in the Giver's memories. These are memories of snowflakes and colors, and with them pain and war and suffering. The memories of the world remain hidden from the town so they can live in relative comfort, but Jonahs learns the cost of living such an easy, unfulfilled life.<br /><br />This is a wonderful read for a change of perspective. Lois Lowry creates a simple and complex world in one tiny short story that will have readers unable to put down until they find out how it all will end.

Even though the movie (Serenity) answered some questions, I am desperate for more.  This DVD set must be one of the most highly rated and most reviewed items on Amazon, and deservedly so. If TV execs could read these responses, perhaps they would see that this would be a huge success, and convince Joss Whedon to make another season (or 10).  I know that Browncoats have been valiantly trying to make this happen for years.  There must be a way!  Any ideas?

Perhaps if I had read more of King, I would've known he was such a romantic . . .  King is a master of suspense, with a gift for detailed, elaborate prose that never feels self-indulgent or overly-verbose.  11/22/63 is no exception.  Give it a read over the holidays.

B005OHSD3A|5.0|I am a 38 mother of two.  What I really like about this diet is that you lose so much initially.  On induction I lost 10 lbs, just dropped it.  It is also very easy to follow because I am a meat eater so having the ability to eat hamburgers and melted cheese is really great for me. What I try to do is simple.  You have to get 12-15 of your 20 carbs per day with veggies so in my food tracker (yes you need to track what you eat if you can, at least track the carbs) I add in my vegetables 1st every day to make sure I have those.  I am very picky and don't like many vegetables so for me I tend to eat cucumber, romaine lettuce, onions and green beans.  All in all about 100 calories to get my 12 carbs and then I can add in my other foods.  I really like that this food keeps me full. With this diet, because I am consuming so much fat I stay fuller longer.  For instance in the morning I eat eggs, with bacon bits and cheese and seriously....this keeps me full for about 3-4 hours, honestly more like 4.  I have to make myself eat.  I also love the fat that my body is now burning fat which keeps my tummy flat! My husband has even remarked to me \\"wow look at how flat your stomach is.\\"  Although he does not want to try this diet, he is sticking with low fat.<br /><br />Previously I lost about 20lbs on a low fat diet, but I had to keep alot of diet food at work because I would just get hungry so much.  Therefore, my drawer was full of 100 calorie snacks.  And after I lost all the weight on the low fat diet, I tried to keep losing but guess I hit a plateau.  I tried everything to lose but nothing helped.  I even had one month where I exercised for 1 hour a day every day and....nothing no loss. I could not believe it.<br /><br />Another bonus is that Atkins gives great support.  So.... if you have a question you can log into Atkins.com forum and ask and they will all respond with their answers....so easy and convenient.  And because many of them are considered Atkins-savvy and have been on the diet for years, they have tons of advice.  The website also gives in depth information about each phase and great recipes.  There is even a carb and weight tracker if you don't have one of your own to use.  Very helpful. The diet is awesome.<br /><br />The last benefit is that for me I have not exercised at all since being on this diet.  I work, have kids, a husband and I go to school so it was great to see the weight fall off when I don't exercise at all.  Now I should mention this is NOT recommended and since I am getting ready to have a Christmas break from school I will be starting back up again.  But it is just awesome to be able to take in about 1500-1600 calories a day, not exercise and lose weight.et for years, they have tons of advice.

B004I2K4E8|1.0|If I could call this anything, I would call it \\"The Celebrity Cast.\\" Could anyone in this program actually sing? I couldn't believe my eyes (or ears) when I saw Nick Jonas step up as Marius. What a joke! A Disney Channel star turned Broadway singer? I think not. He is by far the worst Marius I have ever heard. And Javert? I have never heard such a grainy voice in my life! If you are new to Lew Misrables, buy the tenth anniversary dream cast and forget that this version exists.
B004U52VPS|2.0|We just gave this to our 7 year old daughter for her birthday- she could not have been more excited.  The squeals of glee quickly turned to exasperated sighs, however.  The concept of the game is simple and sounds fun- players take turns picking cards that state how to build the stage and then use the included birds to knock it down.  Simple-in theory.  The narrowness of the blocks and the fact that they are mostly the exact same thickness (and have a depression on both sides) makes it hard to stack them- level 3 cards (the hardest) were impossible for the kids to do without help, and it took me a good 5 minutes to stack the blocks without them falling over.  Also, the ice blocks that are 'fractured' in the middle do not stay together very well, which creates another stacking difficulty.  Once the levels were together the kids had fun flinging the birds from the slingshot, but when it takes 5 seconds to knock down something that took 5 minutes to put together, it just doesn't really seem worth it.  It was fun for about 10 minutes...think I'll be returning it, unfortunately.
B00158K0S8|5.0|PAtton was a man built for war, he was superintelligent and a man of honor. He was also ruthless and pushed his men to the extreme but he was up there with them. One of the best generals of the last few centuries by any reconing.  This film could have been a disaster but instead it was a masterpiece. From it's starting speech to it's final moments as the great warrior waits for more battles. This movie is even more remarkable in that it came out in 1970 when the military was hated by hollywood and they did smear jobs about it. Not that it's perfect mind you or that war is really glorious in reality. But that's how patton saw it and it's a good thing he did too. This movie looks great on blu ray and the print is free of dirt, the natural film grain is there but that's ok. Patton is a war hero and this film which one an oscar for the great late george c scott. (and it made him a movie star instead of just a character actor) is worth every penny . Unlike many other titles out there from this era they cleaned this one up for blu ray and it's worth upgrading to.  It's not going to be as sharp as movies made in the last 15 years but the blu ray looks great really. unlike the sad releases that I have seen such as 'rio lobo' or 'the horse soldiers' movies that have dirt all over the prints, even 'little big man' is a bad print on blu ray. THis one is NOT a bad print and a plus for your collection.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Ok so since I actually read what this was for I KNEW that it was ONLY the movies.  I am not sure how people get so bent out of shape.  If you actually take the time to read the whole thing and compare it to other items you would see this.  The movies are great and I don't need all the bonus stuff.  I had originally purchased all 7 movies before and someone stole them so having to buy all 8 worked out well for the price.  No disappointment here =)

034552554X|4.0|I generally avoid books set in the modern U.S., and when I read them I don't like them. This book is an exception.<br /><br />The Language of Flowers tells the story of Victoria Jones, who's emancipated from the foster care system at age 18--with no friends, no money, no work experience and nowhere to go. (Fortunately, she knows a lot about flowers.) It also tells the parallel story of the one placement that almost led to her adoption at age 10, and how that went badly wrong. The parallel storylines work really well here, keeping the suspense high and illuminating aspects of the story that might not have been obvious otherwise.<br /><br />This is a story that can only be told in the first person. Victoria is one of the most honestly written, authentic characters I've encountered in a long time, and although my background is nothing like hers, it was easy to relate. This is an emotional book--because as it turns out, the most difficult obstacles Victoria has deal with aren't finding work or an apartment (although that isn't easy), but connecting with people after a lifetime of rejection. But don't think for a moment that this book is trite or sentimental. Instead, it deals with difficult relationships and emotions in an entirely genuine way, without pulling any cheap tricks. Which makes it an incredibly powerful book, and for that, I can't recommend it enough.<br /><br />Cynical readers might notice (as some reviewers have pointed out) that Victoria gets very lucky, both in business and in the people she meets. It's easy to envision her winding up addicted to drugs, with a no-good and possibly abusive boyfriend, and unable to find work of any kind. But that isn't this book; this isn't a book about how being in the system is likely to lead someone to wind up on the streets or in prison, but about how being in the system can leave someone so emotionally damaged that even when she has an opportunity, it's virtually impossible for her to lead a normal life. And so, yes, Victoria has that opportunity and the end is hopeful. It worked for me.<br /><br />I will say that while Victoria is an excellent, fully-fleshed-out character, the development of some of the other characters was not quite as good. And while the writing style is good for the most part--Diffenbaugh is a good writer; this isn't your average pop lit--there were a few eyebrow-raising sentences of the \\"Putting on my clothes, I went outside and unloaded the truck\\" variety (she unloaded the truck while putting on her clothes?). But these quibbles pale in comparison to the overall excellence of the book, which I would recommend to anyone, not just those who normally read this sort of thing. Because, hey, I don't, and I still loved it.<br /><br />Also, there's a dictionary of flower meanings at the end, which is just awesome.and the end is hopeful. It worked for me.

B000SEIBB8|2.0|This isn't a review about the content of the book itself; that definitely deserves 5 stars, it's absolutely a classic and is essentially required reading for anyone who takes developing software seriously.<br /><br />The two stars I gave this book applies only to the Kindle edition. Specifically, whatever scanning was done to digitize this book butchered the diagrams. They are very low resolution and the text on them is nearly impossible to read. This is a big problem as the diagrams are very helpful when working through the written content. It is very nice to be able to search, highlight, annotate, and access your book from anywhere, but in my opinion essentially losing the diagrams is not a reasonable tradeoff. There are also some OCR errors sprinkled around. Nothing that makes the text confusing, just some 'i's for 'l's that I've noticed, but it just makes this version even more disappointing. This is one of the most popular software engineering texts of all time, what's the with the totally amateur conversion? Even running it though spellcheck would have found some of these errors; I can't imagine an excuse for it.

B0012GMV4O|5.0|Mountain / Climbing! :  Leslie West (Guitarist & Singer) is phenomenal on this album, which is not to take anything away from the rest of the band, but Leslie is the well deserved star.  The great hits \\"Mississippi Queen\\" and \\"Theme from an Imaginary Western\\" are reason enough to buy this disc but the rest of the album is just as good.  This is a five-star album.

Everything in this album works, every song is a gem, and every little conversation included has the authenticity of Bluesmen working together.

0553386794|5.0|GRRM kicks off an incredible series. The characters are rich, complex and compelling. GRRM is compared to the venerable Tolkien, but where Tolkien's characters are shining lights, GRRM's are sometimes heroic, other times cruel, at turns repulsive and later sympathetic, depending on the point of view from which the story is told. The result is a brilliant tapestry and a flowing, gripping tale.<br />The book and those that follow are a revealing portrayal of feudalism. The term \\"game of thrones\\" is used by the characters in the novels to describe endless positioning for power among the 1% of an imagined medieval world.<br />GRRM's understanding of human nature is enthralling.
B000003CM9|5.0|The Allman Brothers Band / Idlewild South:  This is an excellent (although brief) album that only has seven songs, but they are excellent songs.  I must confess however that their version of `Hoochie Coochie Man' sounds so much like Johnny Winters that it makes me laugh (in joy, not ridicule).  Although this CD is very good, I recommend that you check out a CD called \\" Beginnings\\" which has this whole album plus their entire debut album together on one CD (and for the price of one CD - as of 2011 anyway).  Idlewild South is a five-star release, no matter how you buy it.

B0030ZOYHC|5.0|I was a big fan of this series when ADV was releaseing it on VHS a million years ago. I was a little skeptical of the idea of a favorite of mine being \\"re-imagined\\". I recently got a Blu-Ray player and was looking for stuff to start a collection. Picked this up on a lightning deal for 8.99. Well worth it. The animation is really nice. There are added CG sequences too.  The only gripe I have is that a couple of the voices aren't the same as the ADV dubs. It's cool though, it's been a long time and I'm sure they did they're best.  Anyway, if you liked the original series buy this. If you never saw the original series buy this.

First of all, there was very little instruction on how to turn it on, unless the card in the  package cover fell out.  He is not totally a computer dummy but he could not follow the directions finally  found on the web site.  He couldn't work the keyboard at all.  Always struck 2 or more keys.  The categories of  books or videos or apps continually rolled.  I felt he really tried and he really wanted it.  I have the regular  Kindle and I am happy.  Marlis Stevens

1592400876|3.0|As someone who considers himself a wordsmith, I'm conflicted about this book. I'm glad to find out that there are so many other passionate wordsmiths and grammarians -- amateur and professional -- with enough interest to make  this book a bestseller. However, I think the author undermines the book's purpose by some of the mistakes I spotted. If she considers herself a stickler, then she and/or the editor/publisher should have done a better job of keeping the grammar gaffes to a minimum. A few others who rated the book one-star have detailed some examples, so I'm going to skip that exercise. The idea of the book was worthy, the execution was no more than average. If I could give this book a 2.5-star rating, I would. I don't think it deserves a 1-star rating like a surprising amount do. But the book definitely could have been much better.

Easy to understand (at the level I prefer to read it) with a lot of great information for all levels of brewers or wannabe brewers.  Even the accomplished brewer should be able to use this as reference (I'm guessing that - I'm not one of those).  But, it is definitely THE book to have if you are a beginner or intermediate level brewer.

These two strangers lives become intertwined as they struggle through the events of their life after to accident.<br /><br />Director/co-writer Mike Cahill (Boxers + Ballerinas) teams with producer/co-writer Brit Marling to challenge our concepts of reality and redemption with this romantic sci-fi drama about a radiant astrophysics student who endeavors to travel to Earth 2, a newly discovered mirror of our own home planet. Rhoda Williams (Marling) was driving in her car and listening to the radio when the DJ announced the discovery of Earth 2, which had just appeared from the other side of the sun. Gazing out her window at the newly discovered planet, Rhoda neglectfully careens into a minivan carrying a small family. Everyone but the father is killed instantly, and Rhoda is sentenced to four years in prison. Upon emerging, the repentant reckless driver finds herself drawn to the lone survivor. Meanwhile, Rhoda learns of an essay contest to win a seat on a civilian space shuttle to Earth 2. Perhaps, on that strangely familiar planet, an alternate version of herself exists -- one that has made different choices, and followed a different life path. The only way she will ever find out is to win the contest and secure her seat on a ride into the great unknown.<br /><br />The 411:<br />I have now read over 10 reviews on this movie and can't believe the balance of love and hate.

B004SBQGHS|4.0|Like many, I played the free version of Angry Birds first and tired of the ads quickly.  This $.99 version requires an account with Amazon and setting up their \\"One Click\\" service. It installed easily on my HTC Droid Incredible2 phone.<br /><br />Angry Birds is a game you can pick up in one minute. A bird jumps into a slingshot and you launch it toward a structure full of green pigs. Birds with new skills and pigs with new defenses appear in the ensuing levels. You can be satisfied with simply completing a level and moving on, or clicking the level screen and choosing one you would like to improve.  The physics of Angry Birds goes from simple to quite clever as you learn how to overcome various obstacles and materials.<br /><br />PRO : Everything from the victorious cries of the birds when you complete a level to their piteous \\"Ow,ow...ow\\" when they fail will keep you entertained for hours.<br /><br />CON : I would give it 5 stars, but I dislike the need to resize the screen so often.  It would be nice to have the user size the screen for their device, and have the game store the data.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Got this so all my HP movies match.  I didn't think there were any special features, but I don't usually watch them more than once so I wasn't concerned.  They do have some extras, though, for each movie.  Didn't care if it was DVD or Blu Ray, but the Blu Ray is a plus with these beautiful scenes.

B0000793ZA|4.0|Some truly massive hooks made this not only a transitional release, but also a transformational one, the repercussions of which launched the beginning of a real awareness of the band in terms of growing their American audience once MTV broadcast \\"Up On The Catwalk\\", the opening track from this CD, and one that is explosively and irresistibly propelled forward with a supple, chiming, keyboard line that is both in levitation and freefall, angular guitar and infectious percussive interplay between bassline and drumbeat.<br /><br />So were the first six tracks on \\"Sparkle In the Rain\\" crafted to attract a universal, commercially-friendly appeal and land Simple Minds arena-sized gigs overseas, or were they the natural outcome of an evolutionary process that emphasized hooks formed around a heavier bottom end and punchier, more aggressive guitar, with keyboards still an important but not centrally crucial component to their overall sound? I really don't know, and really don't care. Maybe U2 did that build-toward-crescendo-then-back-again and sustained explosive release with impassioned vocal delivery better than their Scottish counterparts, but on \\"Up On The Catwalk\\",\\"Book Of Brilliant Things\\", \\"Speed Your Love to Me\\", \\"Waterfront\\" and \\"East At Easter\\", Jim Kerr easily rivals Bono in his ability to create dramatic tension, while the band's interpretation of Lou Reed's \\"Street Hassle\\" is a sensual revelation. The last four tracks can't maintain the anthemic grandiosity of the first six, but considered individually each have some distinctive element that brings the listener back, with \\"White Hot Day\\"'s heavy,lockstep groove and sinuous guitar work and the haunting atmospherics of the instrumental \\"Shake Off The Ghosts\\" the most compelling, to this listener at least.<br /><br />For those who might think that Simple Minds were biting U2's passionate style, it might be helpful to point out that U2 is on record as pointing out that Simple Minds were on heavy rotation on their bus while they were touring.The band already had five previous full-length releases to its credit, and though Steve Lillywhite was on hand to serve as a creative midwife, \\"Sparkle In The Rain\\" is the work of a band at the height of its maturity and playing to its strengths. It was my introduction to the band, and still ranks as my favorite 27 years later. I can recommend it without any hesitation
B002SSUQFG|1.0|This is a nice looking watch, but obviously a hit miss deal with whether or not you will get a working one.  I got the first one in hand and it would not keep time, got the replacement and it would not keep time either.  I never got either one to keep time for longer than a few hours before it would stop.

1439183392|5.0|I just love Don Winslow.  I would say that \\"Power of the Dog\\" is his best novel to date.  It is his epic.  I really enjoyed \\"Satori\\" especially since I read \\"Shibumi\\" just prior to reading \\"Satori\\", but it was a fairly wide departure from Winslow's California beach Oeuvre.  \\"Savages\\" his most recent in his normal territory prior to \\"The Gentleman's Hour\\" was not one of his best, and I wish Oliver Stone would make this film instead of Savages. This novel which brings back the \\"Dawn Patrol\\" characters has everything that Winslow excels at. Therefore I rank it second to \\"Power of the Dog\\".  The surfing vibe, the humorous dialog, a couple sub plots, the Baja Cartel with a scary new villain, and even a revisit to the insurance industry that he managed to make so interesting in \\"California Fire and Life\\" are all included here.  I am not a fast reader, so when I finish a book in two days it usually means it is damned short or damned great.  This was damned great, and unfortunately too short.

0374275637|4.0|We have been fortunate over the last 30 plus years with a plethora of research on the cognitive illusions that our mind/brain will manufacture based on the circumstance or environment it finds itself.  In this fine addition to the behavioral sciences, we learn more about the quick thinking system of fast conclusions and the slower system of cognitive reflection based on experience or rules.  The author explains that he uses nicknames throughout the text as System 1 and System 2 versus more descriptive names.  By using the nicknames, the author takes up less working memory of the reader and of the resultant reader's ability to think.<br /><br />System 1 (fast) does not keep track of alternatives and makes quick decisions.  One needs System 2 (slower) to act rationally.  Of course quick decisions serve us well for most everyday and common activities.  It is were we are in new and unfamiliar situations that are cause for concern.  In today's busy and electronic environment, we find ourselves in more and more unfamiliar situations that we are unaware that we are even in them.<br /><br />Enjoy this new addition to the mounting work that our minds are the ultimate machines in conserving energy.  It takes energy to think and our minds find a multitude of ways to not think.  If you are interested in this genre of cognitive psychology, then a few of my other favorites on the subject include:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0307461645 On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind's Hard-Wired Habits]]  by Wray Herbert<br />[[ASIN:1422176754 Think Twice: Harnessing the Power of Counterintuition]] by Michael J.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I like that its something different than the norm.  I like that it shows girls in survival roles.  I like that it talks about the significance of healthy weight and survival.  A great way to analyze human nature,  self discovery, and traumatic stress...for young adults!  While it is very detailed it leaves much to the imagination.  I like that you get a sense of gore with out it really describing every gory detail.  I also like that there is romance with modesty.  Just really well done.
B003Y5H5AG|2.0|Very good movie, with great animation and a good cast. That is, if you can get the DVD version to play; seems it won't in some DVD players. Tried two separate copies in our Toshiba and Philips players, which handle anything else.
B005UKK4Y2|1.0|Should have been named \\"Horrible Movie.\\" Disgusting dialog, lousy plot, could have been funny if it wasn't so unnecessarily crude. When are filmmakers going to understand that crudity for its own sake is not funny? Don't waste your money.
B004ZNB12O|1.0|..with the previous reviewer. There is no questioning the quality of the material here...it is outstanding...and out of context, and therein lies the problem.<br />Where as a band like Led Zeppelin's catalog could be fragmented and still make sense, taking Pink Floyd apart is well, like taking an early Frank Zappa album apart. At least the \\"Echoes\\" collection from a few years back had a cohesion of sorts to it (primarily because of the band's involvement in the project, and is highly reccomended over this atrocity)<br />This comes off as nothing but a mercenary move by Capitol. If you need a Pink Floyd primer, find a copy of \\"Echoes\\"[[ASIN:B00005QDW5 Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd]]
B004GGM444|1.0|First, the production quality is great. It's impressive to hear the layers and crisp sounds, with deep base. Someone really knows what they're doing. That being said, it feels weak in its maturity. Take Deadmau5 as a comparison; Deadmau5 has a narrative and uses the tracks to build a direction for the listener. It's subjective, but I'm not impressed with Skrillex. It's all over the place and tries to impress the listener so hard it sounds like a conversation with a 14 boy after chugging Monster drinks all night. So yes, it's very well produced, but no nutritional value at all.

0756405890|3.0|Avid readers of fantasy fiction will enjoy The Name of the Wind, by Patrick Rothfuss. He is a decent story teller, able to build tension as well as give the reader a chuckle.   Having said that, The Name of the Wind rarely rises above the adolescent wish fulfillment that plagues much of fantasy fiction. The main character is bold, able to learn languages in days, is one of the most capable students at a university of magic in spite of being the youngest, and, of course, has flaming red hair. Oh, and don't forget he was orphaned at a young age, and lived on the streets as a beggar and thief.  If that wasn't enough, in the sequel the main character gets his introduction to sex from a siren who destroys all other men with her passion. Of course he survives and immediately travels to a foreign culture where sex is as casual as conversation.   These novels are filled with powerful characters staring each other down, and in spite of reviews by people who should know better, the magic is nothing ground-breaking.  It rests squarely on the basic principles of sympathetic links and the power of knowing something's true name.   Finally, Rothfuss writing is colorful, but flabby. He frequently falls to describing things by what they are not, and writes purple prose that calls awkward attention to itself rather than creating the drama he is trying to achieve. For a quick taste, sample first and last pages where he bookends his tale with the \\"silence of three parts\\".   In spite of their quotes on his behalf, Rothfuss' skills are not equal to the likes of Le Guin, Card, or Gaiman. The Name of the Wind and its sequel, A Wise Man's Fear sit comfortably with other bestselling, but otherwise unexceptional works like that of Terry Brooks or Robert Jordan.

B0038BBA4I|5.0|\\"Sigh No More\\" by Mumford & Sons contains musical tracks that blend elements of indie rock and folk.  I was intrigued to obtain this collection because of the musical tracks and videos of \\"The Cave\\" and \\"Little Lion Man.\\" I have frequently heard both of them on the radio and  at first was very neutral  about \\"Little Lion Man\\".  However, \\"Little Lion Man\\" eventually grew on me the more that I heard it.  This collection contains songs  that are soul stirring, and these are among some of the ones that resonated with me:<br />\\"I Gave You ALL\\": A great song about how the singer poured out his heart with intensity.<br />\\"Awake My Soul\\": This seems to be about being exposed to situations that ignite the spirit, and increase the fire in a soul.<br />\\"Winterwinds\\":  \\"Winterwinds\\" appears to be a message about  what happens when following the heart.<br />\\"Sigh No More\\" by Mumford & Sons is great to get for the many who like to listen to folk rock and/or indie rock music.

B004EPYZSU|4.0|\\"Cowboys and Aliens\\" rode into theaters with a unique premise but the movie plays out like a cross of a couple of other films. Imagine if H.G. Wells had written \\"War of the Worlds\\" as a western instead of taking place in Victorian England and if it was crossed with Sergio Leone's \\"A Fistful of Dollars\\" and you'll get an idea as to how director Jon Favreau's film of the graphic novel of the same name plays out. The film reminds me a bit of Ray Harryhausen's \\"The Valley of Gwangi\\" if we replace the dinosaur with aliens--an interesting if not entirely successful combination of two very different genres.<br /><br />The first hour of the film works extremely well and Daniel Craig who resembles Steve McQueen from \\"The Magnficient Seven\\" fits the role of Jake Lonergan (a man who has no memory of what he's done or who he is) perfectly. He's discovered in the middle of nowhere by a trio of hunters with a weird mechanical device attached to his wrist that can blast anything to smithereens. After he's arrested in town Longergan finds the device handy in fighting alien spaceships that fly in and rope the towns people like cattle.<br /><br />If nothing else the first hour proves that should Daniel Craig choose to do a western and play a character like Eastwood's \\"The Man-With-No-Name\\", he'd do a terrific job. A bit of trivia about the movie--Ford has played oppostie TWO actors that have played James Bond (Craig and Sean Connery in \\"Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade\\").<br /><br />Harrison Ford as cattle baron Woodrow Dolarhyde does a good job as Longergan's nemesis who ends up working with Longergan to try and save his son.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks terrific with a demo quality disc.The film looks amazingly sharp throughout and has nice depth without sacrificing the \\"look\\" of a film. Audio is terrific--it's a strong, immersive Lossless presentation and it helps one appreciate the terrific sound mixing and editing done on the film.<br /><br />The special features include a commentary track from the director, a documentary that covers the film from conception to production. You can also unlock an interactive \\"second screen\\" presentation of the special features on your iPad. Although I have an iPad I really wanted to just watch the material rather than play with this special ap/feature.

B0060V1WJ6|1.0|1.  I'm a huge office fan and thus Steve Carrell fan, but he is definitely capable of making some lame movies.  This is no where as bad as his recent one;  it's so bad and pathetic I can't think of the title... but it's the one where he plays this loser... but then again, he also plays a loser in this movie...  Question:  is there some pattern developing here for Steve Carrell?<br />2.  Bottomline:  If you like completely unrealistic romantic comedies with a heavy sarcastic and pathetic bent to things, you'll probably like this movie.  If not, then definitely skip this most stupid movie.
0805080120|5.0|This book is a whirlwind scholarly tour through the mysteries of how language evolved. Always chatty, often using a dry British wit,  Deutscher is as up to date as today's slang and as deep in the past as the Akkadian cuneiform language.<br /><br />Deutscher is always having fun with his material -- whether starting with the fictitious phrase \\"Me Tarzan you Jane\\" which Edgar Rice Burroughs never wrote, or reciting a litany of complaints about the decline of English going back at least to the 17th century.<br /><br />Some of Deutscher's theories are only speculation, but he makes it clear what their basis is and how he is going a step beyond conventional linguistics.<br /><br />This book is also full of interesting tidbits, such as the unusual history of the French word \\"aujourd'hui,\\" the development in modern Hebrew of a new grammatical structure, or the strange role of the word \\"gonna.\\"<br /><br />Highly recommended for the interested, inquisitive reader -- not only for the specialist.

It is always valuable to understand what we eat, where it comes from, and the price we pay for our abundance.  You'll think twice about the \\"super size\\" option!

0393061310|4.0|GUNS, GERMS & STEEL is like a textbook, a tedious read but well worth the information.  It examines human development both historically and geographically.  As a lay person I learned some amazing facts of how we human beings developed and why some cultures dominated while others disappeared.  If you have the patience it's well worth the read!
B001DTPZNY|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It had the same Indiana Jones vibe as the earlier movies, plenty of adventure, the same unrealistic stunts and situations. I find most of the negative reviews about it here on Amazon laughable. It seems the people negatively reviewing this movie havent even seen the previous three. The whole series is based on 30s serials and is supposed to be over the top adventure. Every Indy movie has dumb unbeleivable situations, if that isnt your thing then I dont know why you are reviewing this type of movie in the first place. People complain about aliens not being realistic? And the knight at the end of last crusade who had eternal life and spent it sitting in a cave for hundreds of years was realistic? Please, aliens, at least to me, were perfect and actually more believable/realistic than anything supernatural that we saw in the earlier films, like the arc of the covenant melting the nazis. Lol so great and fun, but not believable. I loved the throwbacks to the earliers flims, we get to see the arc again in the area 51 warehouse, instead of massive amounts of snakes and rats we get ants. I really dont like Shia Labeouf either, but he wasnt bad enough to ruin the whole movie. He actually turned out decent as a 50s greaser. Either way, I had a smile on my face for most of the way through this movie. Anyone who understands the Indy series for what it is, instead of putting it on some pedestal like people seem to do, should be able to appreciate Kingdom of Crystal Skull.
1451648537|3.0|Like most of the reviewers on this site, I couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs.  It's a fascinating read; despite its length, it goes very quickly.  But at the end, I came away feeling somewhat empty, having hoped for fresh insights into Steve Jobs's personality.  And there were precious few.  Because of his extensive access to Jobs and to those who knew him, Isaacson was able to glean an enormous amount of information about Jobs' background: his adoptive and biological parents, his biological sister, and his short stint at Reed College. Likewise, the genesis of Apple, his ultimate ejection from the company he started, his years at NeXT and Pixar, and his ultimate, triumphant return to Apple are all described in great detail. Those (like me) who only had a \\"broad-brush\\" knowledge of this history will enjoy reading about it in detail and gleaning the perspectives of Jobs's colleagues in these ventures.  And it is in these descriptions of all of Jobs's technological achievements that his genius shines through.  However, those hoping to gain a greater understanding of who Jobs really was will be disappointed.  The fact that Jobs had a fiery temper was well known before this biography was published, and Isaacson chose to hammer this point home ad nauseaum.  It wasn't really necessary for Isaacson to use the term \\"reality distortion field\\" (referring to Jobs' unrealistic demands on his employees) hundreds of times. Nor was it necessary to catalog every instance (or so it seemed) when Jobs berated someone. What is missing is any suggestion that there were positive, counter-balancing aspects of his personality.  There is virtually no mention of his relationship with his 3 children with Laurene Powell, nor with Powell, for that matter.  We know nothing more personal than that they were both vegan.  Surely this man who inspired so many, and who was so accomplished, had to have had character traits that endeared him, at least to some.  But you will not find any here.  This book also needed a good edit.  It was longer than it needed to be, and excessively repetitive.  I attribute this to the fact that the publisher rushed to get this book out as soon as Jobs passed away, so any potential editorial enhancements were cast aside in favor of quick publication.  I'm sure there will be biographies of Jobs written in the future.  I do hope that these biographies-to-be focus more on who Steve Jobs really was and what he meant to other people, as opposed to his spectacular business achievements.

B0034G4P8A|3.0|I only watch these comic character movies for visual effects, and the visual effects in this movie were absolutely breathtakingly stunning.  The realm of Asgard was superbly detailed and the characters seemed \\"believable\\" there. I did not expect to be blown away by the cinematography. Chris Hemsworth was excellent; Anthony Hopkins, as usual, was wonderful; Loki seemed a wonderful character. (I never read the comic series, so forgive my ignorance as to how the movie compares to the real thing)<br /><br />  Unfortunately, the \\"action\\" moved to Earth Realm.  That's where Hollywood is and where every movie has to have trite, boring, boilerplate dialogue.  And a totally UNbelieavable heroine/love interest.  There was no chemistry at all between the two characters, Portman was terrible in this role, and honestly - the movie would have been better without that entire setup because it simply did not work.  Did a different person write and produce the Earth Portion??<br /><br />I watched this on Amazon streaming video, on a big plasma set and the picture was excellent. I doubt I'd pay to buy the Blu Ray disk. It was worth the $1.99 I paid to rent it, but Portman and the Earth Realm Dialogue really ruined an otherwise fine, fine movie. Would have been 5 stars from me were it not for her and the terrible, contrived earth scenes/dialogue.  I hear Thor will be back.  Perhaps they'll bring Loki back.  But please, oh please in the name of Thor's Hammer do NOT feature Natalie Portman again.
1451648537|5.0|I have enjoyed this book so much.  It is incredible to me that Steve was able to get away with his behavior as long as he was. I have lived with someone with the same personality disorder as Steve, which is clearly borderline personality disorder, and so I am not surprised by any of his specific behaviors or the volatility or how his mood shifted almost hour by hour. It really is incredible to me how someone with such a mood disorder could have such power, but I'm glad he did because of all the amazing Apple products that came out of it. I read the book shaking my head with the combination of both knowing, and disbelief, both at the same time. I almost sort of wonder if something about his childhood might have been left out, the part that may better explain the formation of his personality disorder. I don't think that just being resentful about being adopted would be enough for something like that to occur.   I appreciate all the research and depth that went into creating this book. It is a long book, and as of right now I am probably only one third of the way through it, but I look forward to reading the rest of it.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I had read both Providence books, and really liked the way Jamie McGuire writes, so I tried BD expecting to be something similar...I was soooo wrong!!! However, wrong in a good way! This book is amazing! I read it in two days, couldn't stop reading, Jamie has this sort of power to make you feel as if you're really living what's happening to the characters. It's a rollercoaster of emotions!!   I still don't know if I love Travis, or I just hate him. I mean, if it was a real situation, and a friend of mine was dating a Travis, I would tell her to just run away from him, because it's just so much trouble, and drama. That's the least healthy relationship ever! However, when you read the book, you can't help but falling in love with him!  I just wish the ending wouldn't be so rushed up. I think there was still a lot of story to keep telling, but I still loved it.  Jamie Mc Guire is an amazing writter. I've loved all of her books, and can't wait for new books to come out!!

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Writer/Director/Actor Woody Allen may have found the perfect actor to inhabit the roles that he used to fill himself in his comedies like Annie Hall and Manhattan. That actor is Owen Wilson, who he discovered - along with Wilson's co-star in this film, Rachel McAdams - in the film \\"Wedding Crashers\\" (of all places). When Wilson spouts some of Allen's dialogue about not understanding his place in the world, you can hear the rhythm of Allen's speech pattern. And, like Allen, Wilson may be the male lead but he's not the normal \\"handsome star\\".<br /><br />This film could very well be considered Allen's French equivalent to \\"Manhattan\\" - his love letter to New York City. This time it is Paris and there are more exterior scenes than interior ones. In fact, for the first four minutes, Allen shows us typical street scenes in Paris with no actors or dialogue; just a 30s jazz instrumental with Sidney Bechet on clarinet (Allen's own instrument of choice.). The plot takes Wilson - in a fragile relationship with his fianc&eacute;e McAdams (who is a very demanding - and not very flexible - flirtatious debutante or the equivalent).- on a time travel journey (at midnight every night) to meet with the artists and thinkers of the literary and art world. There are Gertrude Stein, Cole Porter, Hemmingway, Picasso, Dali and more. It helps a bit if the viewer knows something about F. Scott Fitzgerald and his Zelda, as well as placing Stein in her Paris years with Alice B. Toklas - but it's not necessary.<br /><br />I've drifted away from Allen films lately but this one surely brought me back and I'm looking forward already to his next film.<br /><br />The images in the film are beautiful but not sharp. This is on purpose since - as you learn in the brief 5-minute Press Conference at Cannes, which is the only real bonus feature (besides the Trailer- cast bios are on the BD) on both the Standard and BluRay DVDs- Allen wanted the film to have subtle colors with brown being the dominant one. (Remember he filmed \\"Manhattan\\" in black and white!). Others at the Press Conference are Wilson, McAdams and Adrian Brody, who plays Dali in the film.) The score is filled with great 30s gypsy jazz and some Porter standards.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"black and white!).

I love it so much I can't go more than a month without listening.  It is dynamic, intelligent, and can create a fantasy in the listeners mind unmatched by any other piece of music by a rock band.  Listen to the entire album, not just a song or two and let it take you to another level of listening pleasure.  You might fully appreciate the album experience and change your limited song by song listening habits.

1400023343|5.0|This thought-provoking book explains the complex factors involved in learning and using more than one language. As a teacher of English as a foreign language for 20 years, I have personally experienced the frustration of trying to help monolingual children become bilingual.<br /><br />The challenge is made even more difficult by the interference of some parents who are afraid that a second language may be a kind of dangerous knowledge, as well as the corrupting influence of conventional schooling which effectively destroys the child's natural desire to learn.<br /><br />This book describes the more obvious advantages of knowing a second language, as well as little known benefits of second language learning. For example, there is evidence that people who learn more than one language have better meta-linguistic awareness, or a better understanding of the nature of language and its role in communication.<br /><br />The author also confronts the old wives' tale that bilingual children may experience confusion or other difficulties, but careful research has found that bilingual children actually have better reading and writing skills, are more likely to appreciate that words are usually arbitrary symbols, and bilinguals are also more flexible than monolingual children in juggling abstract concepts, as well as in divergent thinking, and selective attention. If anything, monolingual children are disadvantaged in comparison.<br /><br />There is no conclusive evidence for the value of early learning, but some evidence that the later you begin learning, the less likely you'll attain a high level of fluency. Children are actually less efficient learners than adults but their brains are more flexible. Children's hearing is also more acute, and sound discrimination is better in early childhood.<br /><br />An interesting insight is that although it isn't true that the particular language you speak determines your worldview, there is some evidence that bilinguals have a broader perspective and greater empathy for others. There is also evidence that learning a second language in school isn't enough; there needs to be support for second language learning outside the school as well, especially in the home.<br /><br />Many bilinguals have a dominant language, and research shows there is no significant difference between the fluency of monolinguals and a bilingual's dominant language. In other words, monolinguals are not more fluent than bilinguals.<br /><br />I was a little surprised and disappointed that there seems to be little research on the relative advantages of learning languages simultaneously as opposed to successively. When a child learns one language first and then you start speaking to him in a new language, he tends to respond in his first language, which he already knows and which he knows the adult understands anyway.<br /><br />Exclusive production in the first language is a bad habit that's hard for children to break, but they need to realize that everybody doesn't understand their first or dominant language. In contrast, when a child learns languages simultaneously it's perfectly natural to respond in whatever language he's spoken to in.<br /><br />Beware of amateur advice from pediatricians and school teachers who have no expertise in bilingualism. This book offers professional resources for an accurate evaluation of any problems a child may have learning more than one language. The author offers a lot of documentation but isn't as dry and academic as the massive volume \\"The Study of Second Language Acquisition\\" by Rod Ellis.<br /><br />This book offers practical advice for helping your child become bilingual. I highly recommend \\"Raising a Bilingual Child\\" to teachers as well as parents. The former may want to read the second edition of \\"One Child, Two Languages: A Guide for Early Childhood Educators of Children Learning English as a Second Language\\" by Patton O. Tabors, for advice on handling foreign language speakers in theEnglish classroom.
B004SIP6QI|5.0|Cold Mountain is lovely movie. It starts with a man who is in love with a young lady, but not man enough to say it. The young lady try's to reach out to him, but he pushes her away. Before he leaves to war they have their first kiss, which was also a good bye kiss. She writes him many times while he is gone. After being shot he is in the hospital getting better. He ask a stranger to read the last letter his love at Cold Mountain sent him. Her last words asking him to go home to her made him leave the hospital, with no word of his leaving, and head home to Cold Mountain. The journey home is a long trip. A lot happens around him and to him on the way. His love at the same time is still writing him and going threw some up and downs in her life. Wishing he would go home to her. The end is sad but beautiful because he made it home to her. This is a great movie to watch with your loved one. Like I did. Or on a nice winter day/night.
B005TMGXZU|3.0|If you have read my other reviews, I tend to focus on sound and/or record quality because others adequately cover a review of the music, which is usually based on a CD or MP3 copy.  The beginning of each side of disc 1 was noisy. (I have not bothered with disc 2 yet.) I would not expect the noise to be present on a \\"180 gram double lp\\" pressing (as the sticker on the bag says) because usually such an effort indicates that sound quality was taken into consideration.  Another thing: why bother with a double lp pressing, giving only two songs per side, and cut it at 33rpm? Why not 45rpm for better sound quality? If somebody has an answer to that, please comment.  I requested a replacement copy from Amazon and will report back as to whether the noise is still present.  The packaging and included booklet are fantastic.  I cleaned this record (both copies) on a VPI HW-16.5 record cleaner with L'art du Son cleaning fluid. I played it back on a VPI Scout turntable with a Denon 103 cartridge.

The weather patterns can vary greatly in different parts of San Diego, and only having the ability to select San Diego as a weather station is lame.

B000SZQNLC|5.0|I was browsing in my family's storage room at home, and I suddenly discovered the original 1979 vinyl release of Led Zeppelin's \\"In Through the Out Door.\\" I cleaned up the vinyl record with some glass cleaning wipes, which is a great alternative to Discwasher, and I played it on my mom's turntable, and the vinyl record sounded excellent without any skipping. There are still some pops and clicks intact, but overall, it was really excellent. I connected the turntable to the computer and converted the record to CD and imported it to iTunes, so i can listen to it on both my computer and my iPod Touch. During the digital transfer, I kept the pops and clicks for nostalgic reasons, because to do so otherwise would ruin the integrity of the original recording. Now I can enjoy the sounds of the vinyl record in the palm of my hand. I'd strongly recommend this album to Led Zeppelin fans alike, and especially the hits, \\"Fool in the Rain\\" and \\"All My Love.\\"
B005COO1X6|3.0|This was a short story so it will receive a short review.  This Kindle single was my first.  It was short enough to be read in a single sitting but long enough to develop a plot which I appreciated.  The story left me a bit disappointed.  I was able to connect with the character in the first chapter and felt like a 10 year old boy again.  The middle chapters seemed to be repetitive without adding anything fresh to the storyline and a bit too far out there.  I did enjoy how it ended.  The story ended with a perspective that can only come from a 10 year old boy. Overall I feel the book is somewhere between 2 and 3 stars. Since I cant give half stars I will be generous and give it three.  Sent from my fire.  Excuse any typos

B0062HS03O|5.0|Not a big fan of Lady Gaga, or could I even call myself a little monster. But I am glad I made this concert purchase on blu ray instead of low res DVD. Even at 1080i, this is one beautiful picture! And I own many blu ray concerts and this ranks up there as the best. With all the different, brilliant colors there is no smearing or bleeding of the colors whatsoever. It is outrageously pretty to just look at!<br />The sound is presented in 5.1 or 2.0 Dolby Tru HD and is very impressive in the bass and surround sound envelopement.<br />If you own a blu ray player and like Lady Gaga, do your eyes and ears a favor and get this on blu ray instead of DVD. You will not be disappointed.<br />Or like me, become a new fan with this brilliant looking treat.<br />Crank it up!!!!<br />But hurry, before this blu ray is hard to find. Got mine as a Best Buy exclusive release when it came out.
