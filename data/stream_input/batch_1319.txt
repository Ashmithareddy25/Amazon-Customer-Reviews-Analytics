B000000Y27|5.0|I am a jazz guitarist and huge Wes Montgomery fan. Arguably, Wes' playing on this album is as good as any studio album that he made. As such, it's a must buy album if you have any interest in jazz guitar, at all. Wes Montgomery rises above the pack in the field of jazz guitar, and this album is a wealth of jazz guitar enlightenment. Wes was not the flashiest jazz guitarist, but his musicality, taste, and creativity were unparalleled. Never a wasted note. He never overplayed. Everything he played was a part of an idea, and his vision was about as perfect as it has come on the guitar. If someone said that this should be a first buy for Wes, I can't argue. The only criticism of this album, compared to his other great works, is the tone of his guitar. The ideas contained within this album are a virtual gold mine for aspiring, transcribing guitarists, but they'll be robbed of experiencing Wes' great tone. Wes achieved an absolutely gorgeous sound on guitar and it is not found on this album. As a listening experience, other albums like, \\"Smokin' At The Halfnote\\", \\"Boss Guitar\\", or \\"Further Adventures of Jimmy & Wes\\", to name a few, might be better purchases, in terms of really capturing the full Wes Montgomery experience. With \\"Incredible Jazz Guitar\\" you get supreme playing, but you don't \\"experience\\" the full artistry of Wes. This is not a knock on Wes, but the recording engineers. Wes was noted for verbalizing dissatisfaction with the guitar tone that was achieved on his albums. I can't help but wonder if this was one of the albums that prompted those comments.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great game to play when just looking for something to do. I love it so far. it gives me something to do.
1451627289|4.0|It seems that two main developments since King was writing early doorstop-size gruefests (It, the Stand ...) are 1- he's discovered romance and sex, which sometimes detracts a bit from the wonderfully wide-eyed acne-ridden adolescent angle of some of his early books, and 2- his once masterful use of language has slipped a bit, largely gone are his wonderful coinages and elaborate wordsmitheries of yore, his English has nowadays become more standard, more pedestrian, and even on occasion ghastly (such as his 'oxes' instead of 'oxen' in 'The Dome')<br /><br />All of the reviews here say it all, so I'd like to revisit SK's take on the JFK drama. Stephen King believes that Oswald acted alone, his wife Tabitha on the other hand believes that there was a conspiracy.<br /><br />In the absence of definite proof either way (yes, 'Case Closed' by Posner - quoted by SK - lays out a good case in favor of the lone gunman theory, but by the same token other solid, non-kook works, including the recent 'The Girl on the Stairs', and a few others make a good opposite case), it seems that wherever one stands in the debate over the JFK murder maybe tells more about who one is, than it does about objective truth.<br /><br />SK, God bless him, is still at heart a working class beer-joint fellow, used to meeting and writing about hardscrabble stiffs who lose it and become unhinged and evil - so little wonder that in his mind, it's one of these characters who did the deed. If it was a conspiracy - it isn't his world, and hence just mayhap harder for him to conceptualize.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game has tons of games that come with it, so you actually get tons of games instead of just one.

B0064NTZJO|4.0|To be honest, I was all for seeing any other movie besides this because of the inclusion of Ryan Gosling (besides the \\"Notebook\\", haven't been many movies I could recall that he acted in) since I didn't think he could pull off the tough guy act (which is what i was going into believing), but as soon as that Miami Vice-like music slowly tuned in, I knew it was going to be one of those \\"not your typical film\\" experience. The music was an interesting choice, as it had that old vibe to it, and it just seemed... to work with the movie. Funny thing is I can't really explain \\"why\\" necessarily. Halfway through the movie, many of the scenes could have been scenes right out of reality. The car chase, while not the usual \\"car chase\\" scene that people are used to, grants a brief view of what a \\"professional\\" would do in the real world without the guns and explosions. I won't spoil for those that haven't seen it yet, but while the dialogue is not \\"clicking away\\" as the \\"Social Network\\", the dialogue really defines the character, which was a refreshing change of pace from other movies. Also, seeing Ron Perlman in the movie was a nice surprise... he pulled off his role quite convincingly.  Just a fair warning to those that do not have the stomach for graphic violence... this movie does have it's fair share of it, and does not hold back when it is present. Let's just say one of my friends that saw it with me with the mindset that it was a PG-13 movie and was quite frankly, shocked to say the least.  I have to say after seeing this film, my view of Ryan Gosling has changed. Ryan Gosling is an actor that can take on all roles and make it his own!  Anyway, sucks that the movie is Ultraviolet, as being able to put the movie on my I-Pod would have been nice. Good picture on the Blu-Ray, but the lack of digital copies takes this down a rating.
B005K17RU0|4.0|clean, simple and no issues that I have seen.  It has the features I was looking for, and seems as accurate as any other forecast.

0938045768|5.0|I bought this book for my husband because he just had to have it.  I thought it was rather expensive but I got it for him anyway.  He loves it!  He reads it everyday and uses the pictures to show him how to do the exercises.  He has been recommending this book to everyone.  It starts you off very slow so that you don't hurt or over exert yourself and then builds into harder work outs.  There are a lot of big pictures showing you how to keep your form.  He even has me doing some of the exercises.

B003V4AK8E|2.0|I give Power A props for trying to improve on the antiquated design of the Sony controller.  However, the poor right stick placement and huge dead zone just negate the point of the redesign.<br /><br />I absolutely loath the Playstation controller's analog stick placement.  So when I saw this controller, which looked like a replica of the 360's, I was thrilled.  It has a really solid feel and the grip is a nice touch.  The left stick is exactly where it should be.  However, the right stick is still too far of a reach.  My right thumb felt very awkward the whole time and I simply could not get into the FPS groove like I can on the 360.  And to make it worse, those who mentioned the huge dead zone where spot on!  I was able to move the sticks almost a quarter-inch without a response.  Finally, the problem that sealed the return was the fact that the transceiver simply stopped working after about 30 minutes of play.<br /><br />I do not recommend this controller for those looking to replicate 360 experience on the PS3.<br /><br />Pros: Great, solid feel. Left thumb stick is right where it should be.<br /><br />Cons: VERY uncomfortable right thumb stick placement. HUGE analog stick dead zone.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|so easy. no matter if using the Kindle or the smart phone, this is s great app that keeps you doused on.sn easy and doable reading plan.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|Havent tried any other software for this, but, having gotten this for free a few weeks ago with the FAOTD, I can say it's worth the $4.99 -- works like a charm, though a bit slow for streaming to your tablet while in a public place (i.e., couldnt use it effectively while in Starbucks).  It would be great if they could integrate multi-tasking this app with other tablet functions--- you can't copy files from your laptop to your tab with this program, or even cut and paste text between the Splashtop app and another tab app you have open.  Seems like this would just be an easy change with how this app uses the tablets clipboard, but alas...
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|Well, we loved it up until the 3rd CD, straight out of the box was damaged.  NO problem, customer service was excellent and it's gone back and they are replacing it.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I can see how people can accuse this book of stealing from Battle Royale, but it is it's own story. There are a few forced elements that remind you that this is for a younger audience. Also, if the author was trying to warn us about the way our world is headed, they failed. There wasn't much to the novel as far as the characters struggling with their kills. You might say that is the lesson: that we'll become a cold civilization, but I like when the heroes struggle over their choices of ending a life - even if it was in self-defense.  I WILL SAY - it was a fun read and I would suggest it to anybody that wants an entertaining read without philosophical undertones.
0525478817|5.0|I just finished this book and I have to say it is absolutely wonderful. The attachment that I built to these characters was heartwarming and at times Heartbreaking. Seriously, if your debating buying this book debate no further, its a must read for sure.

030788743X|5.0|I have never been much into reading science fiction (with the exception of an occasional Philip K. Dick book), but I knew Ernie in high school and always enjoyed his quirky sense of humor, so decided to give this book a read.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It was a very engrossing and fun read from beginning to end. The book takes place in a future dystopia where people spend the majority of their time interacting in a virtual environment to escape the bleak reality of the real world, living out their lives in sort of an existential angst. The one hope to escape and rise above all this is to win a contest and inherit the fortune left behind by the creator of the virtual environment.   Growing up in the 1980s, I enjoyed all the 80s references throughout the book (there were even several references to The Space Giants! I loved that show when I was growing up!).  Also, having grown up in the same town as Ernie, I enjoyed the several references to the town.
B001F12J48|2.0|I just got a new 3D TV and blue ray player. I thought this would work on my new tv and player, but it didn't...it was all blurry. It is such a great movie, we just had to watch the regular version. I was disappointed that nowhere did the description say that it would not be compatable with a 3D TV or blue ray player. Presented in 3D is misleading. Still enjoyed the movie itself though.

Watch this musical for a while, and you'll be sure to be cheered up by all the classic songs in Grease. Just looking at that young John Travolta can instantly put me in a better mood. Oh, if high school had only been like this!<br /><br />Gotta love Grease!

B006LS7DQE|3.0|I like this game and played it all the way through on Xbox Live.  I thought it would be fun to have it on my Kindle Fire.  You'd think that if it were available for multiple pieces of hardware that it would play better on some than others but it seems to me that nobody bothered to see how this \\"Kindle Fire Edition\\" played on a Kindle Fire.  They should have removed some animation or effects that cause the game to bog down when multiple matches are made.  It's inexcusable when this entire edition is custom built for one platform.  It's still a solid, fun game but I am really disappointed in the choppy effects.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I won't repeat what others have said, only to reiterate that this is the best Bible app available.  Both this Android app and the iPhone app are very well done.
0385534639|4.0|The Night Circus is not just a novel: It's an experience. It's like the book equivalent to watching Avatar or the ice scene in Dr. Zhivago. The magic of the circus setting and the Victorian style narrative creates an experience of decadence and lusciousness. I loved sitting down to read this book. Every time I came back to it, I was drawn into the world of magic, fantasy, and forbidden love.<br /><br />Celia and Marco are the magicians, bound together in rivalry, who fall in love. They start in the novel as children living out their fathers' twisted game and are then trained for their ultimate impending competition. The source of their individual powers is handled in two different ways. With Celia, it's an innate power; however, for Marco it's a gift of manipulation of perception. But, in spite of differences, the result is magic nonetheless. Whether it's a leather jacket being transformed into doves, a perpetually burning fire, kittens performing acrobatics, a fire breathing paper dragon, or a truly spiffy ice garden, the magic is truly intoxicating.<br /><br />I would classify this book as a strong character novel. However, Celia and Marco, in this case were side characters. They were not as developed as I would have liked. Even though, the reader first encounters the characters as children, their depth is never truly realized. This is partially a product of third person parallel narratives, which inevitably draws focus from the two main characters and spreads it across other scenes and people. Another reason for this disconnection between the main characters is the timeline in the book. I personally felt a bit deprived of the development of the love affair because the book jumped across three years after their first stolen kiss and bounces back and forth frequently. The effect is heightened suspense but an ultimate detachment from the characters and their developing love affair.<br /><br />But these are really small criticisms considering what the trade-off was. The reason I maintain that this is a strong character book is because I think of the circus itself as being the main character. The reader sees it from its inception to its... well, to avoid spoilers, I'll call it a transformation. The circus is the reason to turn over 300 pages. Celia and Marco's relationship is romantic and intriguing, but it's not what pulls readers into the narrative. I fell in love with the most remarkable and dynamic character in the book, the one with the dark, mysterious magic that engrossed me from the beginning. The Night Circus is not the setting of the book. It's the entire novel, and it's worth every page.s is a strong character book is because I think of the circus itself as being the main character.

B004LWZW7E|4.0|In this dystopian tale, Will Salas (Timberlake) has little time to live.  Literally.  His personal timer - begun for all on their 25th birthday - displays vividly on his forearm.  In this Brave New World with day-glow countdowns, most people scratch and claw their way through life and work to accumulate more currency in the form of time.  Time pays for everything with an expiration date: eggs, milk, and even life.  So when Will runs into Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer), a rich man flaunting his time around at a seedy bar in the ghetto, he intervenes to save Hamilton from a murderous Minuteman (i.e. time thief) played excellently by  Alex Pettyfer.  The old man, deciding he has had enough of life, essentially commits suicide by gifting all of his time to Will, creating a situation where Will can simultaneously serve as a Timex Robin Hood, dishing out time to all he deems deserving, and upwardly mobile revenge-seeker.  In this latter role, Will encounters aristocrat Phillipe Weis (Karheiser) and his cute daughter Sylvia (Seyfried).  It's no surprise the opposites of Will and Sylvia connect - he throws caution to the wind while she takes no risks with her eternal lifetime.  Ultimately the age-old battle against \\"the man\\" ensues, where Cillian Murphy awkwardly chases Will and Sylvia before the combo create communistic chronicity.<br /><br />What struck me while watching this film is internet joke regarding money, women, and time that holds true for Will's encounters with the fairer sex.<br /><br />Women require time and money<br />The old Ben Franklin saying, \\"Time is money.\\"<br />A little math gives us: Women = (Money) * 2<br />The mistransliteration of the Old Testament tells us \\"Money is the root of all problems.\\"<br />Therefore, Women=Problems.<br /><br />Overall the film is well executed, but a little underwhelming.  The protagonist is perhaps the worst actor in the film, and his beautiful sidekick is probably not even in the top 5 of beauties in this film.  So we're left with an interesting concept filmed very well, acted adequately, with an interesting screen play, but slightly lacking in terms of drama.ll, acted adequately, with an interesting screen play, but slightly lacking in terms of drama.
B005GVF95O|4.0|This was the first app that I let my 2 year old daughter play. She had a blast and really enjoyed the puzzles. The very simple interface allowed her to understand how to move pieces quickly.<br /><br />There are two kinds of puzzles:<br />- Single animal puzzle where you need to figure out where each puzzle piece goes to complete the animal (head, arms, feet, body, etc). A little more difficult for a 2-year-old to understand but can be completed with help.<br />- Multiple animals puzzle where you need to find the placement for 4-5 animal puzzle pieces. This one was easier for my daughter to understand and she was able to complete these quickly.<br /><br />No problems technically, worked fine on Kindle Fire.

0743270754|4.0|This was the book that Barack Obama was reportedly reading when putting together his cabinet in 2008. Now that the administration is a few years old, it's fun to see how the \\"Team of Rivals\\" approach worked.  Of course, the point of Doris Kearns Goodwin's book isn't to show current events. It's to shed light on how Lincoln led. This book does an excellent job of writing about the 1860s on its own terms. Lincoln wasn't seen as a great leader until later, and some of his subordinates, for good reasons, felt themselves his superior politically and intellectually. Yet, learning how Lincoln survived those opinions, and at times turned them to his advantage, brings a new appreciation to how his leadership achieved what was best for his country during its most difficult time.  The book's weakness is that the four \\"rivals\\" aren't sketched with equal depth. Seward comes across much more vividly than the others, though Stanton has his moments. (The story of Lincoln, the rube lawyer, not even getting a meeting with Stanton in earlier days is among the book's most effective.) You can tell that at at times, the writing is being forced into the concept. That aside, this is still a great read for anyone who wants to understand politics or management.

B0041T52S6|5.0|Probably the most noteworthy thing to note about this movie is that its style is heavily influenced by video-games and comics.  This movie had roots in a comic done in a manga style.  The general plot of the movie is depicted on the cover of the movie.  Scott wants to date Ramona Flowers and he has to fight 7 evil exes to have the right to.  It sounds like a video game/comic book plot.  This movie is big on hipster humor as well with comics like they are better live after they just hear a live concert.  As far as my opinion goes, I think this movie is a great one.  The cuts are unconventional, refreshing, and the scenes and outfits are carefully orchestrated to provide an awesome engrossing experience. This movie doesn't ever feel like they are thrusting story at you either, yet you understand all of their relationships to each other by the end.  Its very funny that a movie as over the top and crazy as this one is probably paints the most real portrait of romance that I have seen in a movie at least on a symbolic level.  I highly recommend getting Scott Pilgrim vs the World if you are a creative comic-loving or game-loving individual.

I've read 137 books in the last 12 months and this one is the best of the lot. Finally a book written for adults! The book covers cancer in various ways: the historical, the political, the scientific, the medical, the personal, the victories, the failures, the hope and the deaths. It reads like a thriller and I loved every minute of it. First book by the author, and I can only hope that he continues to write.

If you are looking for something for more pro use or live sound I would spend more and get a more capable unit. The only complaint I can come up with is the plastic feet. They are not even so it wobbles when sitting on my desk.  Would have liked some rubber feet. The other thing I would have liked is a way to select which channels get sent to the headphones/control room without changing the main mix.
B001E2JNA6|4.0|Having owned the first release of this on DVD, I was thrilled to find this available on Blu-ray.  The miniseries itself is amazing, of course, and the special features are thorough and insightful.  There are some scenes I shall never look at the same way again!  But here's my caveat... and I am not sure if it's a defect with my disc or a more widespread problem... I found that there was \\"noise\\" in the picture off and on throughout, on both discs, mainly on lighter flesh and fabrics.  But suddenly as it appeared, it would go away!  And then, towards the very end, when Darcy and Elizabeth are taking their walk, the picture loses resolution for a couple minutes.  It's as if they put in a sampling of what they had to work with, pre-restoration.  But I have a feeling that's not the case, because it's quite distracting during such an important scene.  I may exchange it through Amazon and see if another copy does the same things.

0312641893|5.0|Is it too early to pick my favorite book of 2012? `Cause I'm pretty sure CINDER has that spot claimed already.<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to make of CINDER at first. When I heard it was a re-telling of Cinderella, I figured it wasn't for me. I'd read a re-telling of Cinderella last year, and I just didn't enjoy it. But then I heard it involved cyborgs. That caught my attention - something original - and i'm glad that it did, because it would've been a terrible mistake to not read this wonderful book.<br /><br />CINDER is a cyborg. She works at the local market as a mechanic where she first meets Prince Kai. Hoping to find a mechanic that can repair his android, Prince Kai goes to the market looking for Cinder - but she isn't what he was expecting. It's there at the market, shortly after they meet, that we first get a look at the plague. When her step sister becomes sick with the plague, Cinder's step mother sends her off to be tested on in - in hopes that she'll finally be rid of Cinder and that they'll find a cure for her daughter. No one is expecting her to survive the testing. But when she does, her past - who she is and where she's from - is revealed.<br /><br />Meyer has taken a classic fairytale and spun an entirely original story that will engage the reader until the very last page.<br /><br />I loved the characters (it's hard not to love Cinder). I loved the plot. I loved the setting. Overall, I just loved CINDER.

0374275637|4.0|An incredible treatise on primarily the life's work of Dan Kahneman and Amos Tversky. Kahneman is the Eugene Higgins Professor of Psychology Emeritus at Princeton and Prof. of Psychology and Public Affairs Emeritus at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public Affairs at Princeton. Although \\"primarily\\" is a useful term, Kahnenan utilizes the leading research in the field throughout the book.<br /><br />How do human beings make decisions? What does the current research in psychology suggest? What do we think we know about the ways the human mind behaves? These are the three primary questions addressed in the book.<br /><br />Kahneman introduces a myriad of concepts. The two main main one's are System 1 and 2, and WYSIATI. System 1 is our intuitive, automatic system. System 2 is our effortful system (self control) engineered to overcome the impulses of System 1. We are all familiar with WYSIWIG. Kahneman introduces the concept of WYSIATI - What You See Is All There Is. Kaheman introduces a pile of research that supports the notion that the human mind (System 1) relies upon WYSIATI to reinforce his contention that \\"we can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness.\\" (p.24). WYSIATI provides us with the equipment that produces the capacity to \\"exaggerate the consistency and coherence of what we see.\\" (p.114). WYSIATI provides the inertia for the human mind's willingness to \\"misclassify an event as systematic - - rejecting the belief that much of what we see in life is random.\\" (p. 117).<br /><br />Throughout the book, the following thesis is an observation that is a constant:<br /><br />  \\"when people believe a conclusion is true, they are also very likely to believe arguments that appear to support it, even when these arguments are unsound. If System 1 is involved, the conclusion comes first and the arguments follow.\\" (p.45).<br /><br />System 1 is associative - looking for memories and experiences that provide a context for the mind to reply to questions, judgments and choices that we humans encounter in daily life. It is also \\"lazy\\". System 1 enjoys \\"cognitive ease,\\" constantly updating our world view in terms of what is \\"normal.\\"System 2 requires effort to engage it. The human mind  is clearly prone to developing biases in making decisions. Frankly, the examples that Kahneman uses throughout the book will both amaze and amuse you.<br /><br />This is NOT light reading. Frankly, this is distinctly a System 2 book - requiring \\"effortful\\" reading. Yet, it is well worth the effort. At times, a background in social research was very helpful to me, as I considered the plight of other readers who may not possess that experience. Yet, perhaps that is an over-simplification of my part, as Kahneman writes:<br /><br />  \\"The world in our heads is not a precise replica of reality; our expectations about the frequency of events are distorted by the prevalence and emotional intensity of the messages to which we are exposed.\\" (p. 138).<br /><br />Kaheman states that \\"the test of learning psychology is whether your understanding of of situations you encounter has changed, not whether you have learned a new fact...you are more likely to learn something by finding surprises in your own behavior than by learning surprising facts about people in general.\\" (p.174.). The way in which this book is written places one experientially within the context of the preceding statement...the reader is required to \\"experience\\" the book...it's personal and participatory.The chapters on Bad Events and The Fourfold Pattern were my favorites...and highlight a myriad of questions in the economic arena that beg for further inquiry. I intend to write a separate article about my observations spawned by these two chapters.<br /><br />The chapters on the illusion of validity, intuition, optimism and expert intuition are fascinating... rearranging what you thought you knew.<br /><br />This book takes one beyond the frontier of epistemology - or how we know what we think we know. It is a groundbreaking treatise into the current results of research that is completely counter-intuitive. What one comes to know after reading this book is just how much we have to unlearn from our knowing and embrace the challenges to learn anew, from this outstanding contribution.<br /><br />I highly recommend Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman...just take your time with it...experience it...as Kahneman has gone to great lengths to invite your participation...learning is effortful. Well worth the effort.hat we think we know. It is a groundbreaking treatise into the current results of research that is completely counter-intuitive.

B0002858YS|5.0|My first Killers album was the the great rarities collection \\"Sawdust\\", which includes a couple of terrific coverversions of \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" and \\"Ruby Don't Take Your Love to Town\\" - of course along with many fine originals.<br /><br />This debut album sounds very inspired by the sounds of the Brit-pop bands of the late 1990's. But the album does not at all come out as dull repetition of what bands like Blur and Suede've done before. Here is energy, fine songs and a singer with both expression and span.<br /><br />The album contains four tracks that were also released on singles, and all did very well on the charts worldwide. All these are melodic up-beat rockers and immediately captivating.<br /><br />Two of my favorites, were originally only to find on the British and American version of the album respectively. In my ears \\"Change Your Mind\\" has qualities tohat could have made it yet another radio hit.<br /><br />One of the most original tracks  for me to hear is slow and heavy (Brit-pop pastiche?) \\"Glamorous Indie Rock & Roll\\". Great vocals by Brandon Flowers. My version of \\"Hot Fuss\\" fortunately contains both songs.<br /><br />A truly beautiful and consistent album, without definite weak numbers.

030746363X|2.0|Going by the reviews, I thought this would be a much better book.  So far, nothing has struck me as new.  I get annoyed reading all the cute anecdotes  -- chubby scientist guy realizes he cant buy fashionable clothes = big AHA! moment and being a scientist, is happy to document his diet progress on a spread sheet.  really ? I find this deflects from getting to the information I want.  Besides, I would have thought his AHA! moment would have been when he realized he wasnt a babe magnet.  The sex chapter seems odd and out of place.  Did he add it in the hopes it would sell more copies ? And, being a yoga teacher myself, I find it even odder that he found a yoga teacher that is so disconnected from her body that he wrote this chapter because of her !!!  I dont know. Maybe I'm missing something --- but as of right now, I cant say I'd recommend this book.

0553801473|2.0|After picking up and putting this book down for over 2 months, I've finally finished ADWD. Why did I keep putting it down you ask? I WAS BORED!!!! Wow...all the repeating of stories and the long drawn out descriptions of what's happening to characters that we don't care about. I skipped through so many chapters. This book could have been written in about 250 pages and it still wouldn't have gone anywhere.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because I still plan on reading the rest of the series...ONLY so I can know what happened to the characters that matter; Arya, Jon, Tyrion, Bran, Rickon (where the hell is he?..haven't seen him in like 2500 pages!), Catelyn, Sansa, Cersei, Jaime, Dany and all the wolves that were given such important places but for the most part have disappeared.<br /><br />I only just started reading this series last summer, so I'm glad I wasn't one of the poor saps that read these books from the first time published and have had to wait years for the next book. Although, I guess I'm one of those saps from this point on. *sigh*
B005HSG3TC|1.0|Very difficult to log in existing magazine subscriptions. For some reason the darn thing wouldn't accept zeros in the subscription i.d. Screen is also a bit too small for comfortable 50-something reading.
B002BWP49M|1.0|Nothing worse than seeing a good subject like Vampires turned into a joke. When you have great shows like Buffy or Angel or True Blood or Vampire Diaries, the bar is set high. So when I saw this movie and others, I have to say, I was bored with the script. All the drab acting by the three leads and the horrible action set pieces.<br />I know little girls or Big girls who think this is a good romance movie but all you have to do is watch one of the above Vampire shows to see that this and the other Twilight movies are made for people who do not like intricate plotting and love glittery vampires. This like Pirates of the Caribbean and those hideous Transformer movies are over-bloated messes that makes tons of money.<br />Of course, this does not mean it is good because it makes a lot of money.<br />Challenge yourself people and stay away from this.

B005XQLBU4|5.0|One of the most fun yet simple games I've played on a small screen. Very reminiscent of Missile Defense, an ancient Microsoft game. My only criticism is that the gameplay isn't as multifaceted as, say, Plants vs Zombies, but what this game does, it does well.
B003VS0CWO|4.0|If you are a Rocky Horror geek, this is REALLY worth owning!!!  The title posters are beautiful, as is the quality of the picture.  The photo booklet is spectacular.  The bonus features of the disk are fun for the fans.  There is the documentary about finding the cast for the Blu-Ray p-i-p cast which is humorous as well as being an interesting insight to the Rocky Horror community at large.  The shadowcast itself is THE most eclectic group of performers from the community.  I can honestly say, no one within Rockydom would have thought to put these performers together and yet, what was produced was absolute pleasure!  A couple of downers to the disk...the sound.  It is yet ANOTHER version of the soundtrack and really nothing spectacular and it would have been really nice to have an Easter egg blooper reel of the shadowcast.
0321356683|5.0|I am only haf way through the book and find it amazing so far.<br />For all those who think they know java, this book might prove them wrong.

However, in the final few chapters I didn't gain much in knowledge. The book in the end tends to be more API driven. It tells you do and dont keeping in API in the mind.<br /><br />Good read nonetheless.

140053271X|1.0|Well, I would love to put pros and cons but I cannot gain access into my nook because of my number 1 con. I understand it is a \\"Wifi\\" device but I just figured it meant it is wifi not 3G. Not that you have to register it before you can do anything with it. I am deployed and have no access to wireless connections where I am at so I am not able to register it to use it.  So until I return home, it will just sit without a purpose. Most of the guys here have Kindles and they love them, I would recommend and wish I did, get a kindle.

B002BU0DPE|4.0|***EDIT/UPDATE #2***<br /><br />Actually the RMA process was amazingly painless and fast. I shipped my headset back to them for about $10 and FedEx tracking shows that I'll receive my brand new replacement in just about one week from when I shipped my broken out to them.<br /><br />***EDIT/UPDATE***<br /><br />After just under a year of using this headset 3-4 nights a week for 1-2 hours a night, the right ear-cup has died.<br />The sound began to go out, then as I'd jiggle the wire at the control box it would come back on. After about half an hour longer it fully died.<br /><br />I contacted Turtle Beach and they are sending me a replacement headset for the cost of shipping them my existing headset for troubleshooting but the inconvenience of the 2-3 week turn-around time was enough for me to come back and warn people.<br />Although they were amazingly perfect for almost a full year, I'd expect at least another 2-3 years before something like this would happen.<br /><br />_____________________________________________________________________<br /><br />I use these to sound-whore in Call of Duty on the PS3 platform.<br />I used to use the Sony PS3 proprietary bluetooth earpiece until I started using my LCD monitor (without speakers) as my display.<br />I could no longer chat using my bluetooth headset, so I went with the PX21 headset because the name Turtle Beach always denoted excellence and the price was right.<br />I wanted something with good quality and performance that I could control the chat audio and game audio separately while at the same time not having to pay $100+.<br /><br />I've had these for 3 months now and have never had an issue. I use them virtually nightly and game for 1-2 hours a night.<br /><br />If I had any wish it would be for a better way to mount the audio control box or simply have the controls installed into one of the earpieces.<br />If it's not securely clipped to a piece of clothing I'm wearing and I move in a certain way that brushesthe control toggle of any of the volumes against my clothes it can temporarily change the setting very easily.

B000068QZK|4.0|I'm sure a lot of people were disapointed with the albums between Diary of a Madman and No Rest for the Wicked, but in a way their still worth having. But I enjoy No Rest for the wicked because it's good. That similar collaboration between Ozzy and Zakk is there like the collaboration between ozzy and Randy. The songs have energy. Crazy Babies is definitely the silliest song, and Ozzy still doesn't know what he was on when he wrote that, but when played from beginning to end, it's not so bad, I've most certainly experienced worse made/placed songs. Overall, No Rest is a worthy album to have in your collection and its overall a good one.

B0040JHKZU|5.0|My local running store put me in Brooks Adrenalines last year as I was preparing for the FW Cowtown 5K. Although I was fat and out of shape I made the distance and fiished the race. This year, I got serious about fitness, lost 45 pounds and am now running 20-25 miles a week. I have had no discomfort in my feet, ankles, knees or hips. I even have a new pair in my closet waiting for the current pair to succumb, so that I can run tis year's 5K AND Half Marathon. I have a narrow foot, so the narrow size really helps.
0312576463|2.0|Altho the basic premise of the story was a good idea, the author presented it in the style of a romance novel with TMI descriptions of sexual scenes - and way too many of them!  Writing style was inconsistent as well.  While the main character often speaks like a Valley Girl with several \\"likes\\" in her statements, the same, or next, page will have a beautiful descriptive narrative with long uncommon vocabulary.  It was as if a student was required to get some specific vocabulary words into a sentence.  I almost bailed on it several times but was reading for a book club and kept hoping it would redeem itself.  Suffice it to say, it never did.  Should have just put it down after the first 25 pages!  Better yet, I should have looked at  it in a store and read a few pages - I wouldn't have wasted my money.  Will definitely steer clear of any of his other novels if this is any indication of his writing.  I prefer thought provoking, well-written stories, particularly for book club reading.  I wouldn't even read this stuff on my own!

0374275637|5.0|This book is an excellent introduction to the heuristics and biases literature, but only small parts of it will seem new to those who are familiar with the subject.<br /><br />While the book mostly focuses on conditions where slow, logical thinking can do better than fast, intuitive thinking, I find it impressive that he was careful to consider the views of those who advocate intuitive thinking, and that he collaborated with a leading advocate of intuition to resolve many of their apparent disagreements (mainly by clarifying when each kind of thinking is likely to work well).<br /><br />His style shows that he has applied some of the lessons of the research in his field to his own writing, such as by giving clear examples. (\\"Subjects' unwillingness to deduce the particular from the general was matched only by their willingness to infer the general from the particular\\").<br /><br />He sounds mildly overconfident (and believes mild overconfidence can be ok), but occasionally provides examples of his own irrationality.<br /><br />He has good advice for investors (e.g. reduce loss aversion via \\"broad framing\\" - think of a single loss as part of a large class of results that are on average profitable), and appropriate disdain for investment advisers. But he goes overboard when he treats the stock market as unpredictable. The stock market has some real regularities that could be exploited. Most investors fail to find them because they see many more regularities than are real, are overconfident about their ability to distinguish the real ones, and because it's hard to distinguish valuable feedback (which often takes many years to get) from misleading feedback.<br /><br />I wish I could find equally good book for overuse of logical analysis when I want the speed of intuition (e.g. \\"analysis paralysis\\").

B00001W9G0|5.0|This has been my favorite movie since I saw it in the theater as a romantic and idealistic young girl, back in the 1970s. I had the advantage of having read Arthur Laurents' novel before I saw it, so I knew the content of some important but unseen scenes -- like that Frankie McVeigh informed on Katie (now Kate) and therefore threatened Hubbell's career.  I was delighted to see that scene was shot, and it's included in this DVD. As is a touching scene where a pregnant Kate, married to her golden boy and living in Malibu, is driving past UCLA in her cool convertible. And she is confronted -- POW! -- with her former self. A young girl in lumpy clothes is giving a strident speech, pleading with her fellow students to get involved, and her classmates are mocking her. At that moment, Katie Morosky realizes how much she has compromised and given up to become Kate Gardiner, and she breaks down in tears.  Sydney Pollack explains that these scenes slowed the movie down and made it too long and less of a love story. That a preview on Friday included them and the audience yawned, the preview on Saturday did have them and was a hit.  From a marketing standpoint, he was probably right. But from an artistic standpoint, he was wrong. The scenes he shot were jewels, and they belonged in the final cut.  I am so glad Sydney Pollack had his say in this \\"making of\\" extra. We lost him 2008. He was a good actor and a wonderful director and terrific company, and this is my favorite of his films.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|When I started this book, I didn't know what to expect. Too often young adult novels generate a lot of hype and aren't able to live up to the buzz. Not the case with THE HUNGER GAMES. Suzanne Collins masterfully creates a tale well-crafted enough to please readers of all ages. Her work is both high-stakes and witty. Her characters are complex, with realistic flaws and personality traits. This dystopian tale is a standout among YA, and I constantly recommend it to everyone I know who reads.
B0032KNA4I|4.0|...for now. In a year's time this film is going to seem extremely out of date. The end of the world plot is ludicrous, but it might have been easier if no mention of the Mayan calendar was made. The legend is obviously nonsense, and it would have been a much less silly film if it stood on its own two feet, independent of such bad science.<br /><br />John Cusack (who is surprisingly good here) plays a failed, but good, writer working as a Limo driver for a wealthy Russian bully. When camping with his estranged kids in Yellowstone he discovers that the Caldera, the San Andreas Fault, and the rest of the world, are about to go down. What follows is more than 2 hours of utterly insane set-pieces, split-second escapes, breathtaking visual effects (which, for once, don't offend the eye), and lots and lots and lots of mega-destruction as Cusack and his family flee from the crumbling world beneath their feet by multiple means of improvised transportation. You've never seen a spectacle like this before, and it raises the bar ex-treme-ly high for any and all disaster flicks that might follow. Emmerich certainly knows how write action scenes.<br /><br />Chiwetel Ejiofor (also not as annoying as he usually is), Oliver Platt, Danny Glover, and Woody Harrelson fill out the rest of an expansive cast as the scientists, President, and Art Bell-style conspiracy theorist. I'm glad that the politics were played down and the 'harsh truths' angle was left unchallenged for the most part. Like The Day After Tomorrow, there are no winners here, but I am beginning to notice a recurring theme among Roland Emmerich's work. It seems that he believes that our world as it is is so broken, corrupted, and irredeemable that the only way to save it is to wipe the slate clean and rise again as one species unrestricted by political or ethnic divides. So, in a way, it's a good ending despite billions being dead.<br /><br />I fear that this might become dated and unwatchable in the future, which is a shame since it's definitely Emmerich's best film. Independence Day is a relic of 90s optimism and the polar opposite of 2012, which deserves better. Only time will tell I guess. If we are all still here come January 1st 2013, then perhaps we should be grateful.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks and sound great in 2.40:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound and loads of extras. There's no reason not to own this!ich's best film. Independence Day is a relic of 90s optimism and the polar opposite of 2012, which deserves better. Only time will tell I guess.

B0012DZ356|5.0|A friend recommended Munro's collection Runaway to me, and I'm eternally grateful! The storis included in this collection are touching and sad. Munro does an excellent job of building settings and moods, but where she really shines is in character-building. You genuinely feel for the women in these stories, and you want things to work out for them even as you fear the worst.

B004UXUX4Q|1.0|SPOILERS  I was going to give this movie two stars for the scenery, but I just can't muster up another star. I almost fell asleep a few times. There's no plot, it did get a little interesting when the protagonist finds out that his wife cheated on him, but Clooney doesn't do anything with that information, I mean emotionally down deep where the soul lies. Nothing. He goes and finds the guy that the wife had an affair with to give him an opportunity to say goodbye to her since she's about to die. How about punching him or ruining his life or something...it's just \\"F U and you better have a better attitude towards me\\" are Clooney's character's words to the cheater. Also why was Clooney's character a bad father because he worked a lot, because he provided a really nice home for his family, because he didn't have enough time for the kids. Frankly Clooney's character seems like he has all the time in the world in this movie. Also as a father he seems very approachable. I didn't see any change in the protagonist from the beginning to the end. Same note, flat. This could have been an interesting story if the wife woke up from the coma, but the way it's written it's so nice and neat. Beau Bridges was wonderful, his part should have been bigger and the teenage daughter was good. I was left questioning whether clooney's character didn't sell the land because he didn't want the cheater to get the commission instead of the sanctimonious reason that clooney's character gives. How about some truth, the real side of human nature unless I missed something and George Clooney is now a saint. There is no inner conflict at all that Clooney's character exhibits.  I have noticed in some of the other reviews that subtlety is the new boring, i.e. if you find a movie boring, it wasn't really boring it was subtle. No it was boring.

B000S58428|5.0|I don't write reviews a lot, only for things that I find deserve truly good or bad remarks. A Rush of Blood to the Head deserves only high praise. This CD has to be one off my top favorites of all time. I listened to Clocks in 2nd grade because I heard it on a commercial and thought the song was so captivating. I listened to some of the songs when I was young, but then rediscovered A Rush of Blood to the Head early in high school. I tend to only like a few songs on albums, but all the songs are so enjoyable and amazing. Coldplay is such a wonderful band, and there is not a bad song on this album. My favorites are Warning Sign, Clocks, and Politik.  I highly recommend this album for people who like bands such as the Killers or U2, enjoy the album!

0452289963|5.0|This book awakened me to a new world. I was desperate for help and sick and tired of feeling unhappy. I was stressed, I was lacking fulfillment, I didn't feel wholesome. I was going through a rough time in my relationship and this book helped me on a whole different level. I read it like the Bible every night and looked forward to getting in bed and reading! It was hard to put down to go to sleep. After about 100 pages into it, it all clicked with me. Its deep, it requires focus and reflection. Sometimes I would read a few pages, pause and think about the content before I could go on, but I just loved it! Its going to be a tough act to follow! Don't know what I'll read now!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I love TCM and their showing classic movies as produced, widescreen, B&W, color, no cuts, etc. But, this is such a beautiful movie that I and my wife love, We wanted our children to watch it. But, B&W is a Huge \\"NO\\" to them. But, the colorized version is so nice... They WATCHED and they really enjoyed the film.  Yes, the film wasn't as intended, but a computer color version was a hit for our younger viewers. To me, the fact that they watched a \\"altered\\" version is OK, since they took the time to watch AND appreciate one of Frank Capra's best.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This movie is a holiday classic and I wouldn't miss it.  Buying the movie (DVD) makes sure that viewing is commercial free and as a set - it not only is in B/W but also color.  Love it.
0517548232|5.0|If this book were required reading for policy-makers and the people who choose them, our country would be much better off.  With lively writing, Hazlitt helps you clearly make the connections between economic policies and their unintended consequences.  Much of the entertainment comes from reading passages that--while written decades ago--are so very descriptive of current events.
1878424319|5.0|This book is easy to read, but delivers powerful messages that applies to our everyday life.  By pointing out the most basic things we do or say that affects our life negatively and guiding the readers to overcome those flaws, the author teaches the readers how to live a happy and free life.  The 4 agreements the author lists are the flaws all of us have, and by pointing them out, he makes you look back at your own actions and makes you realize how some of the things you say, feel or do everyday is impacting your life in negative way.

B004DK5CW4|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made! Our family absolutely loves it and can't watch enough! Diane Lane was simply marvelous and so were the supporting actors! DEFINITELY have this movie in your DVD collection!
B001BNFR6W|1.0|I love this show, however, the DVD's are extremely poor quality.  I watched the first 3 seasons, and every single disc had multiple issues with skipping, stuttering, or completely freezing up.<br /><br />I tried them in my home theater system, my laptop, and my xBox.  Identical timing/placement of the skipping.<br /><br />I returned the item, and got a replacement, however, the same issue is still occurring.<br /><br />Do NOT buy this if you actually plan on watching the show.  If you just want a box on the shelf, then it looks great!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Wonderful way to stay tapped into God's word! Especially love the audio option and ease of use.  Praise the Lord!
B0045HCIYA|1.0|It has to be a National Lampoon parody of how bad a bad movie can be. The humor is corny enough, the social milieu is sleazy enough, and the sly efforts to suggest a latent 'political correctness' are phony enough to qualify \\"Striptease\\" for main-time Fox Network TV. ...<br /><br />\\"Ah, but then, there's Demi Moore!\\"<br />Maybe. Are you sure it's her? If it's really Moore doing the high kicks and back bends around the porn-pole, then she's a much better dancer than an actress. It's conceivable that the whole sordid boring mess was created specifically for Ms Moore to show off her silicon, which she does abundantly, but hey, were your eyes focused on her face consistently enough to be sure it was indeed HER silicon? Would it matter whose silicon gets revealed? I mean, jell is jell! I suspect that Ms Moore's ladylike enunciation and prim manners wouldn't win her the camaraderie of the other pole-polishers backstage either. Nothing about this full frontal satire of America manhood and American power structures is close enough to the sordid realities to be funny.
1451648537|5.0|This book is absolutely engrossing, giving a picture of a very unusual person with indomitable personality, which, unfortunately had a fatal flaw--namely that he thought he could do anyone's job better than they could--including his doctors. It was difficult to put this book down, and I regretted that it didn't g go on for another 500 pages. . The research by the author was staggering, A real masterpiece! The best book I have read in a long time.
B001NLKT60|4.0|If you have read the Girl with the dragon tattoo alredy you know the characters already.  If you havent read the girl with the dragon tattoo then you are on the wrong book, read that one first.  These books are in a series and a lot of character/scene setting is done in the first book.  Some of it is loosley repeated in this book and the third book, but you will be missing out on a lot of points if you dont read the first one.<br /><br />This book follows the same theme as the first book, same main characters, but a totally different story line.  Still thriller style suspense, but all new back story and supporting characters.  It follows from the first book and picks up at the exact point the other book left off.  I really liked this about the books, they all flowed well together and could have easily been one book of three parts.  I am not sugessting they should do that, but explaining that the story flowed.<br /><br />This book is much easier of a read than the first one.  The endless backstory setup and location information is now gone for the most part.  There is still some clear Swedish pride, but it is not nearly as noticeable as in the first book.<br /><br />The story is well written and very credible.  I am a closet conspiracy theorist so some of the sub plot was very compelling for me.<br /><br />I am not a huge reader, but I whipped through this book in around a week.  Starts reasonably slow, but once you are in you will want to finish up.<br /><br />Recommended.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Ready Player One is a great ready overall. I love books that use an alternate reality to comment on our society today. Ready Player One does that while also being entertaining and exciting. My only gripe is the book tends to ramble off long list of unnecessary 1980's trivia. Also, the narrator tell the ready lots of facts instead of fleshing them out for us to see.  However, these flaws do not take away from the overall enjoyment. In fact, I usually dislike author that \\"tell\\" instead of \\"show\\" but Ready Player One does a lot of \\"telling\\" without losing me. A good read for sure.
B0015DROBO|3.0|For all folks wishing to start the millenium series this is the gateway book and you cannot start without it.  I am not a big reader and recently got a kindle to try and increase the amount I read.  My wife is a big reader and had read this series a few months back and recommended them to me.  I am normally into more science fiction style thrillers, but I figured I would give this a go.<br /><br />The book is very good and I am glad that I read it because it allowed to read the second the third books in the series.  The third book is by far the best of all three, in my opinion.  That said, it is slow to start.  There is so much time spent on background of characters, that in my opinion is unecessary.  The main two characters (I am being cryptic so as not spoil anything) dont even meet until approx half way through the book.  There is far too much background story set up with totally pointless character histories and fact finding.  You can tell the author used to be a journalist!  There is also a very obvious Swedish pride theme in this book.  I understand it was written by a Swedish author and is set in Sweden, but there is a lot of wasted energy spent on locations and swedish traditions that are not noteworthy, but take up valuable page space.  It isnt annoying, but it could have been toned down in my opinion.<br /><br />With all that said, the second half of the book is very compelling and once you get through the first half the second half will flow like water, you wont want to put it down.  I think the book took me about a week, 5 days on the first half and 2 days on the second half!<br /><br />Stick with it, it is a good book and the characters play well together, just gotta put in the up front investment to get there.<br /><br />Once you finish the first book, plan on picking up the second and third in short order.  I read the second one in a week and the third one took 3 days!  Excellent series with reasonable writing style overall.  It is no surprise they made a movie of the first one and are planning the other two.ning the other two.
0143119680|5.0|i had found this book for a dollar on a bargain shelf and got it to look cool on my new bookcases my husband built me with not a desire to read it. then my best friend bought this book fo rme on my kindle for a christmas gift and felt i had to read it because i owed it to her. i am ever so thankful she bought it for me and in turn made me read it. this book is on my top ten list and will be one that i will  re-read for years to come. amazingly written, rich with history and folklore. it got ahold of me and i could not put it down once i started it. i cant say enough good things about this book. i dont want to do spoilers in my reveiw so cant get in depth. this might help.... my other top authors are elizabeth kostova(the historian) stephanie meyer(twilight saga) cassandra clare(mortal instruments and infernal devices) jane austen, charlotte bronte, j.k rowling(harry potter), audrey niffenegger(time traveller's wife) robert jordan(eye of the world)gillian shields(immortal series)lisa mangum(hourglass door trilogy) so if you like or love any of the others you must read this book. can not wait for the next one to come in july. bravo deborah harkness you rock in my opinion
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|If you havent read Girl with the dragon tattoo and Girl who played with fire you are in the wrong place.  Go read those two books first.  This book is the conclusion of a three part series.  They are great books, but this one is the crowning glory.  However you need to read the first two in order to appreciate the third.<br /><br />The book picks up right from where the girl who played with fire left off, literally the next day!  I love it when series books do that, rather than a brand new story etc (like the Alex cross style novels).<br /><br />By far the best book in the series, the action starts very quick.  Lots of the character build up and backstories have already been prepared in the first two books.  A few new main characters are introduced, but it is done with ease due to the readers involvement in the lives of the main characters.<br /><br />I am a closet conspiracy theorist and this book kept me reading, I wanted to get to the next page so bad.  A real page turner.  I literally could not put this book down and finished it in a matter of days.  Once you start you wont be able to stop.<br /><br />Great writing, fantastic end to the trilogy.  What a great shame the author is now dead and we wont see any more of his fantastic work.  Major loss.<br /><br />If you can perserve with the first book, the second is much easier going.  The third is amazing!
B0053YGYO4|2.0|Coldplay's \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" is kinda like U2's \\"Zooropa.\\"  Bad title, bad songs, and doesn't come close to living up to the expectations of one of the world's greatest bands.  Hopefully, like U2, Coldplay can move on from this tepid album and make some more great albums.  Very disappointing.

1451627289|5.0|I've never read a Stephen King novel before, but I started this on Friday and finished it on Monday. I was completely absorbed. It's the work of a man who knows how to write. I wondered how he'd end it, since it's pretty complex. In the hands of a less-experienced writer, it could have fallen apart, but it didn't at all. A brilliant, compelling yarn - one I can't get put of my head. It's been ages since I felt this connected to a novel. Bravo, King!

I love it, works great and outstanding build. This Nikon 1 system is not a replacement for my F6 and D700 but a way to expand my camera system and the opportunity to make that capture in time and at the moment of what may have been a lost shot. I now have a real, mirror-less, quite, fast shooting back up with me at all times, well almost! A great add to my exclusive and expanding Nikon system. Great job Nikon!

B006JTS5OO|5.0|As much as I love Jason Segel, I wasn't entirely sure how he would do with \\"The Muppets\\" given that he usually works in more adult territory.  After seeing the movie in theaters, my apologies to Mr. Segel, because he did an absolutely amazing job bringing \\"The Muppets\\" back to the big screen!  You can tell how much of a labor of love this movie was for Segel.  \\"The Muppets\\" are treated with a reverance that most \\"re-launches\\" of franchises don't have.  All of the characters have the same characteristics and features (both physically and emotionally) that they did in the original \\"Muppet Show\\".  Even the situations that they find themselves in now are believable, from Fozzy performing in Reno to Gonzo owning a plumbing company to Miss Piggy editing a fashion magazine.  Even the minor characters are the same as they once were.  The best part about this movie is that the Muppets really are the centerpiece.  While there's the backstory about Segel's \\"brother\\" (who is a Muppet) and the relationship between Segel and Amy Adams, the focus is on how the Muppets are going to save their theater.  Even with all of the celebrity cameos (and there are a ton), you never get the feeling that Segel wanted to make a blockbuster with an all-star cast.  He knows that the Muppets are big enough stars in their own right.  The movie isn't perfect, with Chris Cooper's villain being just a little too over-the-top (the \\"maniacal laugh\\" joke falls flat the first time out, and doesn't get any funnier the next five) and Segel's brother being just a little too obsessed at times.  But these are all minor flaws in what really is an excellent movie.  \\"The Muppets\\" isn't so much a movie as a tribute to a group of characters that we all grew up with.  There's a great feeling of nostalgia throughout the whole movie that adults will appreciate, with more than enough laughs to satisfy young and old alike.  Segel's homage is a very moving tribute to characters he obviously adores and also a nice way tointroduce an entire new generation to the magic of the Muppets.

0307959856|2.0|When we last saw Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzwilliam Darcy they had overcome all Pride and Prejudice to become two of the most enduring characters in English literature.  Not surprisingly that distinction has lured modern authors into playing in Miss Austen's sandbox and thanks to continued fascination we have seen Elizabeth and Darcy fighting zombies, as Rock Stars, as vampires, in modern times, in Victorian times,  their children, their grandchildren and more descendants than you could shake a stick at.  And it's not just the principle characters who have gotten more press, even minor ones have taken on a life of their own leading to books featuring Wickham, Jane, Lady Catherine, Mr. Bennett and dozens of peripheral characters, but up until P.D. James took on the challenge we haven't had a real mystery novel set at Pemberley.<br /><br />Anyone who is a fan of Miss James knows she writes tight, suspenseful books full of details and twists.  She's the kind of writer that can keep you up all night turning pages.  So you would think when she turned her attentions to the Darcy Clan of Pemberley there would be a chilling murder with scores of suspects and red herrings at every turn!  Sadly, there is not.<br /><br />Charming scoundrel George Wickham is involved in the death of his friend, Denny, leaving the Darcy household in chaos on the eve if the Annual Ball.  The actual murder is boring, the plot leading up the murder is boring and the people themselves are boring.  I can't believe I made it through the whole thing without falling asleep.  I held onto hope for innumerable pages that some great-great-great relation of Miss James' premier detective, Inspector Adam Dalglieish would pop up and help solve the crime but nothing that interesting happened.  We get a tired \\"mystery\\" all conveniently tied up at the end, and then a rehashing of Pride and Prejudice all over again.  This book really made me long for a bunch of zombies to break into the courtroom and eat their brains - or one to break into my house and eat my brain before I could finish reading this waste of paper.into my house and eat my brain before I could finish reading this waste of paper.

B004TI5N38|3.0|Why was a family of four murdered in brutal fashion?  Does it matter that the father was a military officer who had access to  sensitive information?  Does the  sparsely populated coal town in West Virginia where coal is mined by stripping mountains play a factor in the outcome?  And will Army Ranger, John Puller, be able to figure it all out?<br /><br />Puller, teams up with a local police Sergeant by the same of Samantha Cole, and together they begin the tedious, and as we find out, dangerous, investigation into the deaths. Puller and Cole build a cozy working relationship that promises to blossom into something more personal, perhaps even before the case is solved.<br /><br />Technical details are woven into the facts such that the reader becomes enmeshed in the complexities of the story in a way few authors can achieve.  Baldacci, with over 100 million books sold worldwide, continues to entertain us, especially if you enjoy putting the pieces of a mystery together yourself as the facts emerge.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|OK so I started watching this series after MANY people recommended it to me. I had just gotten a Kindle Fire and so why not watch this on Prime.  Before I knew it I was 5 episodes into the first series!  This is one of those shows with so many twists and turns it keeps you craving for more.  The cast I think is perfectly selected!  I'm not a motorcycle fan, I've lost a few close friends to them but this brings you into a whole new world and it almost makes me want to ride!  I can't say enough about this show, there is something for everyone in it, from fighting, to shooting, to suspense and even a little bit of love mixed in.  It brings you into the world of an \\"outlaw\\" biker.  Obviously a knock off of some stories told by Hells Angels.  But if you have any slight doubt about this show, just watch the first episode and see if it doesn't get its hooks into you.  If I could give this more than 5 I would!

She loves anything to do with One Direction but regardless of that, this book is good value. Great quality and beautiful photos. It arrived much faster than I expected. I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the book, and the service. I'm not sure which repetition of reading the book my granddaughter has reached now. I know it's a good few more than one, and she only got it at Christmas.

One of the reasons I like it so much, beyond the fascinating and mysterious characters, the cinematography and costumes, and the expert acting, is that the fictional story line is wrapped around historical events.  SO well done!!

0375842209|5.0|Narrated by Death, in the midst of one of the most horrific time periods in all of history, you would think The Book Thief would be unbearably dark and heavy, or just another WWII story, but it's not. A balanced and beautiful read comes through a tight focus on Liesel, a young girl living in a foster home in Nazi Germany. Zusak also shows us the different sides of the German populace, the loyalists, the rebels, the indifferent, the hunted, the compliant. Liesel is in the middle of this and her ability to find joy in books and learning to read them, in people and in the smallest things, like a shiny candy wrapper, and to be able spread hope to others, when they have no shread of it left, is a beautiful thing to behold. I love the juxtaposition of the voice of Death, so mocking, pretentious, flippant and cold against her innocence, her random moments of happiness and the warm relationships she's able to form. It is odd enough to snag Death's attention and imprison it. I would definitely recommend The Book Thief. The horror, sadness and beauty within it and the character study on humanity make it unforgettable. I'm not big on Observant narrators because I often feel detached from the focal point character, but that didn't happen, and I thought this would be boring, as the beginning kind of plunks along and it had me worried, but I was soon riveted and I am sooo glad I kept on reading. It's now my favorite book.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it way more than I thought I would. Grocery lists, passwords, wish lists and even copies of important documents. I use it on iphone and kindle fire.
B0000DI86O|5.0|As with every production I've ever seen with Domingo, his acting as well as his wonderful voice and musicality provide a powerful experience for the viewer. This opera is no exception. Andrea Chenier is a strong performance with a story that not only makes sense - (many opera stories are just plain silly) but actually provides a sense of history at the same time. I enjoyed this production very much. The supporting cast is also very strong. Production values are good. This is the only opera of Giordano that I've ever seen so I can't compare it. But I thoroughtly enjoyed this  one. Domingo with his dramatic intensity was the focal point of this opera. I don't think you'll be disappointed in this opera.
B000N39HOE|5.0|I'd never heard of the musicians before, but happened to hear their \\"High Life\\" on the radio and knew I had to investigate. The entire album is an absolute charm, and the packaging is super snappy. Strongly recommended for old-school jazz fans. ^_^b

B0041KKYEM|1.0|Best title of a review of this movie ever is the one that likens it to Showgirls and Stayin' Alive. It's totally what this pathetic sophomoric \\"Wow SO deep\\" suckfest was. At least Showgirls did it with more flair and less deadly earnestness. Aronofsky has always been the kind of director who mistakes thudding unpleasantness and grotesque imagery for depth; usually the people most enthralled with him are male college juniors who fancy themselves as intellectuals and don't realize how pedestrian and boring they truly are. I thought Portman's acting was vastly overrated. She had basically two looks (in between vomiting, but Aronofsky has an absurdly adolescent fascination with vomiting. To him it's de rigueur in all his movies, because nothing says MEANINGFUL and ARTISTIC like an actor pretending to dry heave into a toilet or all over himself): scared anxious rabbit and drowsy \\"is it real?\\" torpor I expect from a character in an after-school special about the dangers of doing drugs. This movie is but one in a stable of overrated Aronofsky movies--I would go so far as to say the Wrestler is his only good one. This movie, oh excuse me, FILM, is the emperor wearing no clothes, and all the pseudo-intellectuals metaphorically chewing on the stems of their glasses are studying the \\"installation\\" in the corner marveling at the \\"starkness and, conversely, the vigor of the artist's statement\\", without realizing that they're looking at the fire extinguisher.
B006NFKUF6|5.0|This is an awesome game. Played it on my kindle and played perfectly. However I am a rightly and the controls were a bit diffucult but since I play games a lot it wasn't a problem for long.
1594744769|2.0|With all the hype and good reviews this book received, I was excited to take it on my Christmas vacation as the main book I'd be reading -- of course, I always have a backup on my Kindle just in case.  Good thing I had the backup.  The writing in this book is not strong, the story was not fleshed out in many potentially interesting ways, and the ending was incredibly abrupt - I kept wondering if the publisher picked a random page to end the book so as to get the sequel ready for printing.  Needless to say, I won't be spending any money on the sequel nor will I even bother checking it out from the library.
0525478817|4.0|This book was too personal for me. It reminded me a lot of Esther, probably because I saw her dedication at the beginning and couldn't stop thinking about her after that, but I also know what it feels like to be dying. I know what it's like to feel like a grenade and this book just hit me hard. It was very well written, I'm a huge fan of John's style of writing, and it made me feel things the way a good book is supposed to make one feel, yet it only depressed me. I did not put this book down and walk away happy, but I still loved it. I recommend it to everyone! If you don't mind crying a lot.
B000ULQV0W|3.0|i was so excited to this cd til i received and played it; but was disappointed due to the deffective part of it. The last track didn't play well, it stops for a while then it plays back. I was trying to find out how to ask for a replacement but when I read the policies behind it,i was dismayed and when i tried for a replacement,\\"no stocks available\\" and it's so discouraging because i was able to purchase another 4 different cds and im getting worried about it, i don't know if they would play perfectly without any flaws. Well, I'm hoping...

0307957934|5.0|Dr. Max Hoffman is extraordinary in several different areas.  He was a wunder kind who earned his doctorate at a very early age, and was hired to work at CERN, The European Center for Nuclear Research.  His project was the development of a system which would monitor world happenings to predict where the next fire point in world politics might break out.  It was a system named VIXAL which would operate in a kind of Gestalt system to learn from its own mistakes.  As time went on, Hoffman's boss decided that VIXAL might get out of hand and had no real use in the actual world.  Hoffman could not give up his project, and the conflict caused him to have a nervous breakdown.  He left CERN, and, upon recovery, developed VIXAL into a system which would predict world happenings and buy short positions on stocks which might be affected.  If the prediction came true, the stock would balloon in value and make Max a very rich man.  As the book opens, he has his company, a lot of money, and a lot of privacy with only his employees (all PHDs), a few friends and a small group of relatives knowing who or where he is.  His life is very uneventful until he receives a mysterious gift, a first edition copy of Darwin's \\"The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals\\".  Hoffman knows it is a first edition because the second edition had a typo in it, but his volume is perfect.  There is no card, and anyone who might have sent it, denies doing so.  Next a midnight break in at his home leaves Hoffman with a bad head wound.  One after another, strange things happen in his life which seems to point to the idea that someone is trying to kill him.  The people closest to him, his wife, Gabrielle and his business partner, Hugo Quarry stand by him until the strange happenings start to scare them.  The strange happenings start making changes in their lives.  Gabrielle, a budding artist, has her first art exhibit ruined when an unknown buyer purchases all the pieces in her exhibit.  Quarry finds that whatever is going on, is disrupting the precise negotiations which are necessary between their company and their billionaire clients.  As the noose tightens on Max's life, things become more confused.  To make things worse, VIXAL starts to report that major happenings on the Pacific Rim are driving down world stock exchanges.  The markets start bouncing around, and Max and Quarry's company is left with no reserves to cover any losses which may occur in their client accounts.  I love Robert Harris' writing, and, while his last book, \\"The Ghost\\" was interesting and excitng, \\"The Fear Index\\" has him back on his original intrigue filled road.  This book will keep the reader on the edge of his\her seat as a solution is sought as to who might be so angry as to try to destroy Hoffman and his circle.  At one point, Quarry suggests that perhaps a Russian Ogliarch who lost billions trying to second guess VIXAL might be the culprit.  Robert Harris is back on target, and I would definitely recommend this book to any fan or just to those of you who love a thrilling espionage tale.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved this book!  It is a great series to read if you are a fan of the Harry Potter series.
B00447L4KA|5.0|this movie was a gift for my son, he saw it in school and wanted it for christmas and he really liked it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its fun at first but after playing the same games over and over to get points to play just one more frigging game isn't as fun. the amount af required points keeps going up and what you earn stays the same and tiny in comparison.

0525478817|5.0|I strongly believe that a book must feel real, whether it is about fighting demons and monsters or falling in love.  Green has written a book with characters who feel so real that I laughed out loud several times, smiled with the characters, and sobbed when they felt pain.  Then, I went back and immediately read it again.  The best books are ones where you know the characters and you miss them as soon as the final page is turned.  John Green has written one of these 'best books.'
B004UXUUDA|3.0|Overall movie was good.  It has a story attached and you must stay with it.  Slow but worthwhile to see the end.  Acting was good.

1451627289|5.0|Wasn't sure how I'd react or appreciate this one. Loved Under the Dome and much of King's previous work...but this novel, I feared, being based on historical fact, left me feeling a bit apprehensive. The beginning of the book, while interesting, seemed a bit slow. However, the last 200 pages are beyond a thrill ride! All said, this book has stayed with me for several days...and I think it will stay with me for many more days to come. Don't want to give too much away...but the ending is very satisfying and left a tear in my eye. However, the editors missed one huge glaring error: On page 781, Jackie Kennedy refers to her two young children, and Jake remembers them as Carolyn and John. How King's editors missed the fact that \\"Carolyn\\" is really Caroline is beyond me!!! HUGE error! For those of us who lived through the assassination and its aftermath, this is a marvelous \\"what if\\" tale. One of King's best.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app!!! It is so handy and convenient that I can take the word of God with me whereever I go.

0439023491|5.0|This is the second book of the Hunger Games series.  It continues by following district twelve winners Katniss and Peeta as they are forced to travel around the districts pretending to be madly in love.  The Capitol, outraged at how they won, is intent on quelling rebellion and the hopes that the winners have inspired.  As the next hunger games arrives, the Capitol announces that former winners will be chosen to compete.  Overall, I thought the book was extremely captivating and well written.  I thought the characters were well created and the plot engaging.  I highly recommend this series.

0439023521|5.0|After a series of catastrophes and wars, North America has collapsed and has been rebuild into the state of Panem.  Panem is divided into multiple districts plus the capital.  Each district produces something of value for the capital.  For example, District 12, Katniss' home, produces coal other districts produce.  Based upon a revolution that occurred 74 years ago, each district much select one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 to participate in the hunger games.  The Hunger Games, put on for the amusement of the capital, is a fight to the death.  When Prim, Katniss's little sister is picked to participate, Katniss immediately jumps in and takes her place.  Peeta, the mail tribute and Katniss, along with their drunken mentor Haymitch, but come up with a plan to survive.<br /><br />I was intrigued with this book from the beginning.  It reminded me of the short story \\"The Lottery\\" which I read in school.  I found the political and economic situation to be fascinating and thought provoking.  Although it is thought provoking it does so without screaming the message in your face.  Overall, it is a fast-paced action story where teenagers must battle the elements and each other to stay alive.  I do think that for boys, the focus on clothes and styling may take away from the action adventure, but overall I think any teenager, young adult, or even regular adults would love this book.
0307593312|4.0|I finally finished this last night, with a mixture of relief and regret.  Relief that I had finally read all 925 pages that had diverted me for the last month or so.  Regret that Book 3 was so weak compared to the first two.  Readers coming to this with expectations of a plot-driven sci-fi adventure tale are bound to be disappointed, or at least they will be by the time they get to page 600 or so.  The first 2 books have a very compelling narrative drive that led me to read them quickly, in big chunks, very absorbed in the story.  But things came to a screeching halt at Book 3.  Other readers, in perhaps a more Proustian frame of mind, may accept the descriptive longeurs, the repetitions, and the seemingly needless details as setting a mood in a time and place (Tokyo, 1984) that itself becomes a character.  I think that Murakami is an excellent guide as to what it was like to live in that environment, as in the other Murakami I have read (\\"After Dark\\").  However, by the time we are two-thirds into the book, things slow up dramatically and there seems no reason to stretch out the proceedings almost indefinately, unless he was intent on producing a doorstopper of a novel.  In fact, almost nothing of note happens in Book 3 till the very end, and one could conceivably skip the first 200 pages of Book 3 and miss very little. The last 10 pages are marred, at least in my view, by a soppily and sloppily sentimental ending so over the top that I feel it must have been meant as ironic or satiric, or something like that. As for the plot, to say that it is symbolic would be an understatement, and, without giving any spoilers, not all the ends seem to be neatly tied up at the conclusion.  I suspect the more hard-core realists and sci-fi devotees may take umbrage here.  On the whole, I suppose I'm glad I read this, but the average reader might do better with those unread volumes of Proust.
0439023513|5.0|This is the third and final book of the Hunger Games series.  It follows Katniss after she and some of her competitors have been rescued from the arena by members of District 13.  While I don't want to give anything away, I did feel like the ending was a bit rushed.  I would have liked a few more chapters to resolve matters rather than the rushed way it appeared.  Overall, I thought this was a good conclusion to the series and highly recommend the books.
B000244EMO|4.0|This movie is a classic, and I decided to review the premier collection version today. This is the two disk version with a ton a special features. On the side of the case it says \\"Collector's Edition 15\\" Now I know this is an older movie so I am going to attempt to review it based on how it was back then, and not compare it to CG now a days.<br /><br />The story is pretty cool, basically a group of special ops people going to rescue a VIP and find something surprising instead. It's a pretty decent story, which has twists and surprises along the journey. The acting is pretty spot-on, and you believe they are the characters that they are trying to become, and they feel like they know what they're doing.<br /><br />The movie is located in the jungles, and it reminds me of a Vietnam setting. The forest is entirely believable, especially with the trouble they had with finding a working jungle. The Heat vision looks pretty low tech, but as an older film so it's pretty good for the time it came out. The rest of the special effects are pretty good for this old of a movie.<br /><br />The soundtrack is pretty memorable, and every time I hear the theme I think of the predator. I do believe this has been copied in other movies, and that just adds to the originality of it. The gun fire, explosion noises, and predator noises are pretty detailed and give personalities to them. I do have to say that some of the scenes you can really tell they used ADR (After Dialogue Recording) though.<br /><br />The special features start off with a commentary with the director, and a sneak peak at I Robot and AVP on the first disk. The second disk includes a multitude of special features which is nice since most movies have little to none, or its really crappy special features.<br /><br />Overall this is a pretty decent film that has a lot of famous lines that came from it, and you can tell that some movies tried to copy from this formula.<br /><br />~ Written: July, 2010<br /><br />Positives:<br />* Good story<br />* Nice effects for an old movie<br />* Good acting<br />* A lot of special features<br />* During the commentary, the director has a dry sense of humor<br />Negatives:<br />* Definitely notice ADR at times<br />* The director kind of muffles his talk at times in the commentary<br />* The heat seeking kind of lacksf special features  * During the commentary, the director has a dry sense of humor  Negatives:  * Definitely notice ADR at times  * The director kind of muffles his talk at times in the commentary  * The heat seeking kind of lacks

B002ZG983M|5.0|Boy does the movie live up to its title. This is an outrageous, over the top, super hero movie with realism as well. It' semi realistic because this is what would happen to you if you tried to just become a super hero one day; but, with some over the top, unique characters thrown in the movie.<br /><br />The story is well written, and it brings the comic book to life. I found it to be believable because you would have this stuff happen to you (at least some of it) if you put on a costume and decided to go \\"fight\\" crime. This is a comedy movie, so unrealistic parts are not as noticeable. The action is over the top, and there is a ton of it as well.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is well done. With the wide variety of colorful characters being portrayed in this movie, good acting helps with bringing those characters alive. The choreography the actors have between each other is professionally done, and you can tell they had to practice those moves out.<br /><br />The location this movie takes place in is a city, which I believe is New York. The streets look realistic, with degradation and detail for all them. The vehicles are pretty cool in this movie. Especially the tuned up Mustang since this is my favorite car. The weapons used in this movie look believable, and work pretty well together with the actors.<br /><br />Overall this is really cool movie, I laughed a lot.  I recommend picking it up if you enjoy watching a movie that's over the top and doesn't take itself too seriously. Because of this movie, I went out and bought a couple issues of Kick-Ass the comic.<br /><br />~ Written: July, 2010<br /><br />Positives:<br />* Funny<br />* Realistic in the way of the consequences<br />* Cool cars and weapons<br />Negatives:<br />* Some bad decisions were made
145265364X|2.0|To give a complete review on an audio book, I feel it needs at least three parts: Story, performance, and overall impression.  First off, the story.  Personally, I adored it.  Thea Harrison has created an interesting spin on the tired old shapeshifters theme.  The plot is not horribly complicated, but it doesn't really have to be, because the characters are so interesting.  The heroine is strong of character without becoming the annoying 'I'll stupidly throw myself head-first into this danger just to prove how brave and self-sufficient (at least in my own mind) I am' woman.  Nor does everyone who meets her instantly fall to their knees in rapture with her just because the author likes her so everyone else should too.  She has flaws.  So does the hero, who is sexy and masculine and protective without taking it to the dominating and oppressive lengths many other romance novels go to.  There's nothing that drives me crazy more than \\"You will come be my woman because we are fated and this makes your protests unimportant so I need not listen.  Nor will I apologize or compromise for you.\\"  He's used to getting his way (with good reason) and pushes a mile for every inch the heroine gives (because, let's face it, strong protective men are hot) but respects the heroine when she tells him he's taking it too far.    And let's not forget the romance.  Oh baby!  It sizzles!  Wow!  Next the performance.  My first impression of Ms. Eastlake's performance was favorable.  She has an interesting voice.  A little high, but it worked very well for the female lead.  Unfortunately, it was once we hit the male speaking parts that things began to fall apart for me.  The hero, Dragos, is supposed to be a very sexy, masculine character, but Ms. Eastlake's vocal range wasn't quite wide enough swing even a semi-believable male tone.  (And by 'tone' I don't necessarily mean a deep voice, sometimes all it takes is a slight drop in register and a change in inflection to give just enough of an impression of masculinity that the reader's brain can take it from there.  I've listened to many books read by female voice actors who are amazing at this.  Susan Ericksen for example.)  But the final nail in the coffin was, as the book progressed, the odd sense I got from Ms. Eastlake's manner of speaking, which came across as somewhat juvenile to me.  The end result being that I felt like I was being read a dirty novel by a teenager.  Very awkward.  Definitely a mood-killer.    Overall it's okay.    If it weren't a romance novel it would've been good.  The plot is fantastic, but a mediocre performance can make or break a book and in this case the breaks make irritating edges that were just too hard for me to swallow.  It wasn't that Ms. Eastlake was bad, I just felt that she was the wrong narrator to voice this particular book.  HOWEVER, I will say that I persevered and listened to the second book (again read by Ms. Eastlake) and she does do a much better job in that one.
B000XA5K48|2.0|This is a very over the top action shooter, and it knows that and pokes fun at it along the way. Basically you have this tough guy protecting a baby that a ton of people want dead and this introduces him to very outrageous events along the way.<br /><br />The choreography of the people fighting each other is top notch with some cool kills. While there are cool kills, you have a lot of stuff in the movie that looks so obviously fake, and this takes you straight out of the movie. I have never seen so many different guns in a movie. Ever. Mr. Smith is always picking up guns from the people he has killed, so you get to see a lot of different guns being used from revolvers, handguns, shotguns, sub-machine guns, and so much more<br /><br />Clive Owen brings his A game to this movie, and he really shines through this movie. From his amusing one liners to him reacting to every day scenarios we face. The gun sound effects are really good, and each gun has its only personality that is brought to life via the unique sounds each one makes. The soundtrack isn't too bad, but with a movie that's about the kills and over the top action, music doesn't really need to be Emmy winning.<br /><br />The special features are pretty cool, with behind the scenes footage runs about 50 minutes long. Along with that, The animatics the director made years ago is included and its about 20 minutes long of rough drawings, but still cool to think he just decided to make this as a pitching tool.<br /><br />If you like to watch movies with over the top action and some funny diaoluge, than this is the movie for you.<br />Note to PC Users: If you watch movies on your pc do NOT get this movie. I was not able to run the movie, you are forced to install the Interactual Player, and I highly advise against that since this program messes up your computer (From my experience with it). This is inexcusable sicne I have watched other movies that offer for you to install the Interactual program, but still lets you watch the movie in Windows media player. So I recommend passing on this movie if all you use is a computer.<br /><br />~ Written: August, 2010<br /><br />Positives:<br />* Varity of guns<br />* Cool choreography<br />* Nice story premise<br />* Some funny dialouge<br />Negatives:<br />* Not the greatest soundtrack<br />* Very bad news for PC users<br />* Bad CG in most of the movieI recommend passing on this movie if all you use is a computer.  ~ Written: August, 2010  Positives:  * Varity of guns  * Cool choreography  * Nice story premise  * Some funny dialouge  Negatives:  * Not the greatest soundtrack  * Very bad news for PC users  * Bad CG in most of the movie
B004XJHBCE|4.0|Great organization app. Coming from an iPhone, this was my missing link. it allows you to organize the home page to your liking. once set up, you rarely need to access the app drawer. just take you time with the initial labels, then when you install a new app, it will prompt you to choose a label. if set up correctly, these new app will automatically show up in the linked folders.
B000OVLBHG|5.0|Ah here is a classic movie and you won't looks at bugs the same way. This takes place centuries in the future (23rd century I think) and earth is all under the Federation and in order to become a citizen (have a baby, be a teacher, etc) you have to serve in the military.<br /><br />You have these three High school students that eventually go off and join the military, and all go into separate branches and you get to see what each one does further along in the story, with Johnny Rico as the main person. The story is put together well, and goes together with the intense fighting with the bugs.<br /><br />One of the people that did annoy me was Carmen. I didn't like her decisions she made in the move (Carmen spoiler: Tells Johnny she wants to go career and broke up with him, but then goes in for a kiss shortly after with the other football guy in the beginning). It seemed like she had double standards, but in the end this is a movie about killing bugs under an all controlling Big Brother government.<br /><br />For its time, the graphics are pretty good. I like the shots with the ships in space and the planets, along with the CG bugs. You do notice certain things are pretty outdated, but there are only a few of them so it doesn't take you out that much. The gun fire sounds pretty good, and the bugs remind me of dinosaurs in a way, and the sounds portray that well.<br /><br />The commentary was interesting to say the least. The director and writer give their insights to the movie, and their ideas on this movie. While it was interesting to get their insight, it got annoying fast how Paul kept calling USA a fascist nation, and even mentioned they it might be fascist that wanting the movie to speed up to war to see action. Also it seems that Paul always talked over Ed, but Ed is a lower talked so maybe he didn't notice him. Besides those things, the insight to how they did some of the shots and the locations they visited was pretty cool. Especially since this is the only way to find out how they did these things.<br /><br />I recommend picking this movie up since it's a pretty cool movie, and a definite classic.

B000J4QWMC|2.0|This movie has equal parts entertaining moments with boring moments. The movie speeds to a screeching halt half way through. You go from undercover stuff, to twenty or so minutes of just some thrown in romance to build attachment to those characters, but fail at it. I mean I really want to like this movie, but it so hard with some idiotic decisions being made towards the end. It's all been done before, and they don't really try and make the story interesting.<br /><br />The story, as I said has all been done before. The same old premise of police going after the drug dealers and the bad guys. I know it's a cop drama, but they don't really bring anything new to it, or any twists. The acting in this movie isn't bad, but that doesn't save them from the mediocre story. Even with good acting, the characters they portray seem to make more stupid decisions as the movie goes on.<br /><br />The setting the movie takes place in is the best part. The beaches are well filmed, and the water looks amazing. I have lived in Florida most of my life, and I feel like they captured it well. Along with the setting, the only good thing this movie does is SOME tactics they use. With those rare scenes, they actually use smarts, and plan out the method of attack.<br /><br />The music in this movie is pretty decent. Some songs play during the fighting and it works well, and makes it entertaining. These moments are rare as well, mainly playing during the parts when they decided to use smart tactics. Gun fire is believable, and the noise of boats racing over the ocean feels like your right next to it. But again sound doesn't make a movie, it is only part of it<br /><br />The special features are not too bad for this movie. The commentary is more entertaining than the movie itself. He talks about real life events he tried and recreate during the movie, and that was interesting hearing about real undercover cops. They also show the typical behind the scenes, and how they filmed parts of the movie.<br /><br />Overall I say pass on this movie.

B004EPYZSK|4.0|... i enjoyed this movie.  it was a \\"tad\\" slow to get goin, but, ultimately very much worth-the-watching.  it was, in fact, what the title implied: different and just about quirky enough to make for a great movie experience.  i'm glad that i have it to watch a few more times.  daniel craig and harrison make a \\"fabulous\\" couple!!! ... i (also) loved the snaggle teeth and dusty britches :-)))))
B000XAE3IM|1.0|Look at the photo....does it not SHOW a Sony battery?<br /><br />Read the product name....does it not SAY \\"Sony NP-FM500H Rechargeable Battery Pack\\"?<br /><br />....it even says \\"by Sony\\" under the product name and the word SONY is a clickable link that magically whisks you away to another page that features exclusively Sony products!!<br /><br />So then why is it that I DID NOT receive a SONY battery?<br />Why did I NOT receive the Battery in the photo?<br />Why did I NOT receive the \\"Sony NP-FM500H Rechargeable Battery Pack\\" that is described at the top of the page?<br /><br />This is false advertising!!<br /><br />!!!WARNING!!!<br />!!!DO NOT BUY THIS BATTERY!!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Being a service professional who works outdoors 99% of the time. I use this app quite a bit. has plenty of info.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|maybe something fun for the weak minded. not for someone who understands the delay of the game responces. Just nor for me I guess.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It gives severe weather alerts,weather notifications, and is ussually very accurate and overall, it is very reliable. It is a great app.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app has changed the way I use my kindle fire! I can take notes when I'm inspired and access them anywhere I need to. Great app!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I bought this book regardless of the one star reviews that I read. American Sniper is an excellent book that is well written and sometimes very intense. I believe that Chris Kyle is a true American patriot whose book does not deserve the comments used by the one star idiot or idiots who obviously did not read the book. I read the book cover to cover and highly recommend it to anyone above a one star IQ.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is so cool. it always has fun games to play. and keeps you on your toes all the time. me and my sister love this game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The variety of games offered makes it enjoyable for anyone of any age. Like the saying goes &quot;time flies when you're having fun&quot; and this is FUN.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is a lot of fun! I have really enjoyed it so far, so I really recremmend it for you! I'm really good at most of the games even though I haven't unlocked many. I have probably only unlocked about 18 games so far!
B005974CDU|5.0|Ever since I saw the video for \\"Pull Me Under\\" on the Headbangers Ball back in '92 (when I was in 4th grade), I have been hooked on Dream Theater. It amazes me that 20 years later, they are still at the very top of their game, and I've never been prouder to call myself a fan. I was a huge fan of Black Clouds and Silver Linings and believed it to be their greatest album since Metropolis Part 2, and that says a lot considering how strong Six Degrees and Octavarium are. Somehow, even after all of the drama that the progressive rock giants have endured over the past year, they have made yet another classic that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Images and Words, Awake, and Metropolis Part 2. In A Dramatic Turn of Events, they have never sounded fresher, younger, and more energized. I don't these guys are ever going to run out of brilliant material.   1. On The Backs of Angels. 8/10.  I agree with many people who say that this album repeatedly reminds them of Images and Words, and nowhere is that more evident than this track. It's a fine representation of Dream Theater's history and I don't know how the Grammy voters can listen to the 5 nominations for Best Rock/Metal and not choose this; however, it's the Grammy's we're talking about so I bet the majority of voters don't have the attention span for a 10 minute track.   2. Build Me Up, Break Me Down. 8/10.  This is the only heavy song that is under 10 minutes and it definitely serves its purpose: it's engaging, catchy, and contains some awesome riffs. And I don't believe I've ever heard James scream like that!  3. Lost Not Forgotten. 10/10.  This is where all the members get to really show off! I've heard this monster of a song so many times and I always forget that it's such a lengthy track--it moves very quickly and contains so many interesting elements that it never feels repetitive.  Songs like this is why they are the giants of progressive metal.   4. This is the Life. 7/10.  This is the only song on the album that I haven't completely embraced yet. It's pleasant and passionate but it doesn't move me as much as the others.  I definitely dig the Hollow Years vibes though.   5. Bridges in the Sky. 10/10.  Right from the moody and Gregorian chant/choir-filled opening, you know this is a song that is going to require your full attention. This has everything you could want in a Dream Theater song. I listened to the album for the first time lying down in a candle-lit room, trying to absorb everything as best I could. I got many chills during this track and I just knew it was going to be the fan favorite of the album. But that was premature of me to think that because I still had 4 songs left to hear.  6. Outcry  10/10.  Like most of Dream Theater's best material, it tends to take 3 or 4 listens until your brain is able to follow along. Familiarizing yourself with a brand new Dream Theater album is such a rewarding experience, and while this particular song--probably the heaviest and most chaotic one here-- took longer than the others to really sink in, eventually it did and now I adore it.   7. Far From Heaven 10/10.  Dream Theater can rock with the best of them but they can also break your heart in a way very few groups can. This is an incredibly moving track that will most likely remind you of both Wait for Sleep and Vacant. When a song is filled with James' warm, tender vocals and Jordan Rudess' atmospheric keyboards, it's always absolutely magical.   8. Breaking All Illusions.  10/10  WOW!!!!! Just...WOW!!! That's all I'm gonna say about this one because I don't have the energy to find the words that it deserves.   9. Beneath the Surface.  10/10  This probably contains the album's most gripping and personal lyrics, telling a story that we all can sadly relate to. This is a highly emotional closing track and I think it would be a fine choice for a single--it's instantly contagious for the newbies but contains some very interesting touches that will keep the prog nerds delighted. And that ending is just breathtaking. I was soooooo thrilled to hear this live last year in Seattle--like all of the new songs, it got an unbelievable reaction from the crowd.   I would rank the Dream Theater albums like this:  1. Awake  2. Metropolis Part 2: Scenes from a Memory  3. Images and Words  4. A Dramatic Turn of Events  5. Black Clouds and Silver Linings  6. Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence  7. Octavarium (you know Dream Theater is a very remarkable band when an album as amazing as this is only their 7th best).  8. Falling Into Infinity  9. Train of Thought  10. Systematic Chaos  11. When Day and Dream Unite
B0054JZC6E|5.0|amazing this app is the best game I have for my I pod it is so great I am addicted to it
B0054JZC6E|4.0|ive been studying for six hrs and cant relax for a nap. I just play these games for thirty minutes and I'm relaxed enough to sleep.
B004A8ZWWE|5.0|There is not much to say that hasn't been said. This is a wonderful movie that takes on every underdog sports movie and father/son cliche and makes them fresh. I will point out a couple of things I love about this movie.  There is the element of the boy and robot relationship that will touch every guy my age who grew up in love with \\"Star Wars\\" droids as well as other sci-fi robots. It's also somewhat reminiscent of one of my all-time favorite movies, \\"The Iron Giant\\". Atom's sentience is never confirmed, but strongly hinted at. For me, in this movie, it works. Especially after repeated viewings. It will be interesting to see where this goes in the sequel. The \\"Let's go for a walk.\\" scene is one of the most perfectly-filmed scenes I've witnessed in quite some time. It will make the robot-loving boy in every man cry. The design of Atom is awesome. Those scarred mesh covered blue eyes and Endor Rebel helmet style head instantly struck a chord with me. Also notice Atom is the only robot without a \\"face\\", yet conveys that he is much more than he was created to be.  Charlie, Max, and Atom all share similar trait. They have absolutely no idea when they're beaten, outmatched, or when to quit. Separately this works against them and they're doomed to fail. Together, however, is a different story. I love the way this plays out.  Danny Elfman needs to be mentioned for his work on this score. He has completely broken out of his box here. There is zero restraint in Atom's triumphant theme, and boy, does it do it's job in the end. I bought the score, it ranks up there with the best of them. Ever.  Lastly, this movie is a \\"movie\\", and not really trying to be a \\"film\\". I mean that in the best possible way. Critics seemed to have completely missed the point, but audiences seem to have gotten it just fine. This movie doesn't come at you with an ounce of cynicism. It's extremely refreshing in this day and age. It's magic is as gleefully undaunted as the characters in it. Some have criticized it for it's blatant emotional manipulation. I will say, if being emotionally manipulated by a movie feels this good, please, give me some more.
B005HSG3U6|3.0|This item is okay, it does what it is supposed to do, cover the Kindle Fire.  When used as an easel, it comes out if position if jostled.  One major plus is that it adds neither bulk nor weight to the Fire.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is an old favorite and a fun way to kill some time!  Just like on the PC and easier then real cards!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Best weather app for Android by a long shot! Accurate with forecasts and has several additional features like news and doppler.
B005G6QF8Y|5.0|This woman has an amazing voice and a very cool spin on dance pop. She is not like the talent-less and auto-tuned wannabees like Ke$ha or Miley Cyrus. She can sing and her style and outlook is cool. Plus the songs on this album are inventive and addicting. She is really underrated.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really like this game on my kindle and I even have it on my ipod. Solitaire is a good game for when you dont have anything else to do. Thanks for this game!
0525478817|5.0|I've read all of John Green's solo work - I love everything he has written.  This, though, is his best yet.  It's not quite as 'deep and emotional' as Looking for Alaska was, but it doesn't NEED to be.  It's hilarious, it's heart breaking, and it's short and sweet.  It only took me two sittings to read this, and I could have easily read the whole thing in one sitting had time been permitted.  Each page was filled with wit; there were absolutely no 'dry' sections in this book.  Anyone who has an appreciation for witty humor and rich (but still warm and welcoming enough for the average reader) language should pick this book up.  It's absolutely beautiful.  Thank you for writing this, John. DFTBA.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|I can not stress how good this movie is, however one should understand it is entirely Character driven. The title does not in fact refer to the lead characters occupation or habit or hobby, all though they are in fact the same thing. This film has some of the finest acting from phenomenal actors all across the board. Ron Pearlman and Albert Brooks steal practically every scene they are in, unless Ryan Gosling beat them to the punch. The introverted, quiet nature of our main character is starkly contrasted by the ferocity and brutality of his actions when he is forced to act.  Don't worry about the bad reviews, some things aren't meant for everyone to \\"Get\\".
B0063IH60K|5.0|short of custom card backs and adds it does a very good job. It could combine more types of solitaire into one app but for the price it is good.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love it, simple and great for kindle fire. format is a bit different than my android phone but I like this app for the kindle fire.
B00004YB9Y|5.0|Enjoyed this CD of the marvelous tenors during the Christmas vacation period. Good transaction with seller! Thanks for wonderful music which will be enjoyed again in years to come.
B005HSL626|5.0|Just disable WiFi or data while playing and no adds! yes you can't connect to the open feint client but who cares?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great Bible app!!  I have it on my epic phone, kindle fire, ipod touch and it works great on all 3 and stayed synced so the changes I make on 1 device shows on all 3.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this dvd because I am a big fan of Jillian Michaels. She does get you to sweat. So make sure you drink plenty of water. All you need for the workout is an exercise mat and some hand weights.<br />I don't like the long intro.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like the two Catholic versions options, hopefully they will add the NABRE soon and will make it downloadable for offline use. I also hope that the Spanish Catholic bibles will also be available offline. It is a great app to have. Thank you.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this app all the time, grocery lists, to do lists, etc...  Replaces traditional sticky notes left all over the place.  Very user friendly, one of my favorites.
030788743X|5.0|You are standing in an open field, west of a white house, and you are holding one of the greatest books currently available...<br /><br />OK, I'm a Zork fanatic, can you tell?  Which is merely ONE of the reasons that I absolutely loved Ernest Cline's Ready Player One, a nostalgic thrill ride back to the 80s through the eyes of a virtual-reality-hooked futuristic society.<br /><br />I had heard fantastic things about this book.  So much so that I bought two copies for friends as gifts before I had even read it myself.  Now having finally completed it, I can honestly say it did not disappoint.  Not one bit.<br /><br />I grew up as a child of the 80s, and most of the references in RPO resounded solidly with me.  I was never big into Japanimation, not having seen much outside of Speed Racer and Voltron, and I never played Dungeons and Dragons.  But I was certainly AWARE of those things, so the constant references to them, along with all of the things that I WAS extremely fond of -- Zork, Joust, War Games, Pac-Man, et al -- just filled my geek heart with glee.<br /><br />I thrilled in remembrance of the old Atari game Adventure, with its totally crappy graphics and game-changing storyline.  I laughed out loud at throw-away references such as a Revenge of the Nerds quest on Planet Skolnik.  I cheered at every video game mention, thinking, \\"Hey!  I remember that game!!\\"<br /><br />I am stoked that this book is being made into a movie.  If it's half as fun as the book was, I'll be in line to see it for sure.
0385535139|5.0|John Grisham is always good!  I read them before the ink has dried.  Good book that ends well.  Love the characters in the book.  Opens your eyes to the world of law.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Awesome game! Easy and challenging at the same time! Great for time Easter or just to have a little fun
B005GVA2L0|5.0|This is an excellent release from Evanescence. This album is different from the previous two in a couple ways. First off, there seems to be more energy in the instruments. This is actually a good thing and I find it easier to \\"get into\\" the beats. Secondly, the songs are overall less \\"dark\\", and there is a little more energy present. I find this to be refreshing. As a long time Evanescence fan, I highly recommend purchasing this album, and I do not believe they should have done anything differently.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|The first three books of Game of Thrones were fantastic!  A++<br /><br />The last two books were not good.  A Dance with Dragons is really bad, or maybe I am just tired of the plot that goes nowhere and the silly phrases and words that GRRM now uses over and over... and over... until you want to puke.  Here is a list of the most irritating and overused words or phrases in these last two books.  (If you have more, please add them in the comments below)<br /><br />1.  Mummer's farce<br />2.  \\"Words are like wind\\"<br />3.  Reek, Reek... it rhymes with (whatever you want to rhyme with reek).<br />4.  \\"Where do whores go?\\"<br />5.  Flagon<br />6.  \\"You know nothing, Jon Snow\\"<br />7.  Jape<br />8.  \\"It is known\\"<br />9.  \\"Broke his/her fast\\"<br /><br />I guarantee that HBO will only do three seasons worth of Games of Thrones.  And this will cover the first three books.  Why?  Because the last two are a mess with a billion characters that we don't care about.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|love this app. i got all notes on sync in all my devices (fire,blackberry and laptops). I have used it for only a week now but Im willing to ditch my paper notebook and other note-taking software.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|You've seen all the complaints about this app, but I have to say, it works great for me. They have obviously fixed the date problem. Being a compulsive list maker, this satisfies my need to check things off in a big way. Always have several lists going at once, all easily managed and quick to access. This is one I use constantly!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|(This is the wife writing the review!) My husband and I saw this movie at the theater. It was great! Not a Hollywood-style movie full of blood, gore, and filthy language, but a down-to-earth movie with a lot of action, clean language, and a very obvious message. It does what it's supposed to do--work on your mind and heart while entertaining you. I laughed throughout the movie and teared up or cried in several spots. I have noticed changes in both my husband and me since we saw this. We have both stepped up to try to be better parents to our children.  Everyone needs to take the time to dance with their kids (or sit on the floor to play with blocks, trucks, Legos, dolls, tea sets, or whatever) when they're little. Sometimes, we forget that, though. This movie is a wonderful reminder of what a blessing it is to be a parent and calls us to get up out of our chairs or off of our sofas and *do something*. I highly recommend this movie to all parents.  The other Sherwood movies--Flywheel, Facing the Giants, and Fireproof--are all equally valuable as heart-grabbing movies. We own all three of those movies and are waiting for our preordered copy of Courageous to add to the collection.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|simply amazing they really do mean 101-in-1 I play this everyday so my advise to you is DOWNLOAD! DOWNLOAD! DOWNLOAD! NOOOOOW ITS HOURS OF FUN!!!!
B004SUWR2C|1.0|it told me its not compatible with my device, like wtf? i want my money back. a total waste of .99$
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its difficult after level 4 but fun. I would recommend it! Hours of fun and highly enjoyable. You cant beat the cost.
B006P0FD4W|4.0|I personally went and saw this movie in theatre with a few friends the night that it came out and was very pleased with the movie. I'm a scary movie buff and of course after watching the first and second paranormal activity I was hooked on these types of movies. This movie is done much in the same way, with the whole film being shot as a series of \\"home movies\\", and much like the other movies paranormal happenings do not start happening right in the beginning, as there is a little bit of a story line to go with the scaryness. I will admit that even I didn't catch on to what was happening until the last seconds of the movie, and right as you figure out what is happening the movie ends. But I have to say that I will be buying this movie and that every penny will be worth each scream and jump that I experience. And as for the  \\"the last 15 minutes will mess you up for life.\\" part of the advertising.. the movie is scary, but not quite enough to mess me up for life.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|Ordered this blu-ray for someones Christmas gift. It arrived as it was expected, new and in the condition it stated in the discrimination.
B0053JJLLC|3.0|If only Crichton finished this book, it might have been a good Crichton novel.  Instead it was just an alright novel written by an author attempting to write as Crichton would.  The story line was decent, the action decent, the science only so-so.  This is more a review of Preston than Crichton.  Had Preston written the novel in his own style, then it would have been different.  I don't know if it would have been better. I never read Preston's works before.  I really do not know if I care to read any Preston books after this book.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Great production and better yet in Blu-Ray. Having the whole series without commercial interupptions is great and Amazon had a great price on the entire collection.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|Me and a friend both bought the PX21's, at about the same time (Dec 2011). They also BOTH broke within days of each other (January 2012). They both only lasted 1 year with moderate use, no misuse or abuse. People complained that my mic would always cut in and out, almost since I owned them. The headphones were muddy, even with bass at a low to moderate level. I just bought a pair of Sharkoon X-tatic SR's and they are 10x better in regards to sound quality and mic quality. I won't be buying Turtle Beach brand for a while.
B006C1DH92|4.0|this games is not that fun it is only a copy of fruit ninja and fruit ninja is better harder and more fun it also came out first so this game is a total copy which is less fun and did i tell you that this is super boring get fruit ninja
B005OCFHHK|5.0|For the price I paid, I am more than satisfied.  All 8 films on Blu-Ray with additional special features should have cost far more.  I also received the item promptly.  I have nothing but good things to say about this product and the seller.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Very fun and addicting. The game gets more intense and challenging as you advance. A must have for all gamers.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Has lots of variety of games. easy for my kids to use. We love it. Doesn't require an Internet connection to play.
B004I9CXHW|5.0|Audi wanted to sell me this cable for $80, but this one is more than fine.  Works perfectly in my S5 and my digital music is very portable now living on a large capacity usb stick.  Build quality on this cable is great; excellent value.
0061997811|5.0|I purchased two of these books one for an 18 year old boy and one for a 14 year old girl.  They both LOVED the book.  A great gift for any REAL HP fan!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Easy to install and run; easier to learn since it 's basically the same intensity builder as the arcade game favorite from long ago.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I am a big ebay user &amp; this app works great.  I'm able to keep up with all of my auctions on the go.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|fun game to play...it gets hard after level 20+.  future upgrade awaiting.  on the harder level, the nuke and missles coming so fast...
B002ZG99A4|5.0|First of all this movie arrived within the week, which was faster than I expected. It came in perfect shape, thanks
B000VLOKQI|5.0|This video was a terrific documentation on a group that defined an era and a powerful movement in rock history.  To see the footage and interviews, espeically with Keith Moon was particularly poignant for me, who was greatly influenced by him, as a young drummer, back in the day.  Worth watching numerous times.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best app available. There are plenty of different translations and it is easy to go from one to another. I love that I can have a variety of daily Bible studies to choose from. The daily reminders for the Kindle fire and the email reminders are very helpful in keeping me on track. The notes feature allows me add notes to specific verses of the Bible. I have actually used this app at church and entered notes during a sermon. The bedtvpart of the app is that it syncs all notes, bookmarks, and reading plans between all my devices -Fire, iPhone, and iPad.
1451627289|5.0|I listened to this while at work....the story is great! I will wait about a year and then listen to it again.

B005K17RU0|5.0|works well with kindle fire. easy to use. great free app. I would gladly pay for app. no problems so far.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is a pretty cool one I must say. some games are a little sketchy but overall, I like it.  its cool
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this has a ton of little games so its lots variety. I mostly like it for sudoku and a few other basics
B004GXKBEM|5.0|This movie was exactly what I wanted for my granddaughters.  They loved it!  The story was wonderful and this is the kind of movie that they love.
B006QPVH6O|2.0|Some cool scenes but just a bunch of weird stuff not connected to one another and way to many issues with the movie.   I get the idea and what they were going for, but they failed to make a movie, rather it's just like watching youtube video(s) out of order.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its different every time. the variety of games makes it fun for me and my kids. there. will be at least one game u will like
0385534639|5.0|An absolute charming and engaging read that captures you so that you find yourself gazing in longing at empty fields on the edge of town hoping for a glimpse of lights, stripes or anything black and white!
B005VMVUAQ|1.0|Though I understand why Cage apparently makes two movies a month because of his much publicised tax problems, I don't understand why Kidman allowed herself to be in this incredibly dreadful movie.<br />The only good thing I can say about this movie is that I only laid out the funds for a rental. I tried like mad to find some redeeming quality in this movie but was completely unable to find one.<br />This may be the worst movie other than The Wicker Man that Cage has ever been in (and that is saying a LOT). Please save your money and wait for this film to blight regular television. It honestly isn't worth the price of a rental at any price.
B005LZW8FO|2.0|*** May contain a spoiler-ette or two ***  I'm sure I'll be thought of as one of those overly \\"left brainers,\\" but here goes. This movie is over the top in its lack of any kind of reason going into the story about impending contact with another planet. Another earth (mirror image) is really pushing it, but that's ok, I just tried to treat that like something from \\"The Twilight Zone.\\" But a planet that looks a lot larger than the moon in the (real, i.e. first) earth's sky? It would have to be really close, and I guess in some kind of shared orbit with the earth or moon. Forget about gravity, and beyond that, forget about critical thinking!  Harry Potter is set against a backdrop of fantasy and magic, ghost movies presume the supernatural, and Star Trek explains away a lot with warp speed. But another Earth just hanging in the sky, in what otherwise would be a realistic scenario, with no attempt at a plausible explanation? Very annoying, at least I thought. On a positive note, the other Earth really does look cool!  One reviewer wrote that the film would have been better without the other Earth at all. Yes, I would have liked to see it eliminated too. But it, or something, was needed to provide a gateway to an alternate reality. The movie just needed a mechanism that would work better.  On another note, the progression of the relationship into what happens between the main characters (won't spoil here) kinda rubbed me the wrong way under the circumstances, but my reaction could be the result of good filmmaking? Just because I didn't like it, doesn't mean it's bad or wrong, though I kinda thought it was anyway.  Finally, the actors who portrayed the two main characters were both superb. And I liked that the female was young and pretty without all the tweezed brows, over-done highlights, etc. for such a character. (The chipped tooth was a nice touch, too, don't know if real or good movie make-up). Movie was well-shot, had effective and interesting interiors/exteriors, and nice camera work.  I almost turned off the movie early in watching, because of its ridiculous premise about the other Earth, but I didn't. So that does, I tell myself,  say something positive about the filmmaking.
B003TNM2K6|5.0|If you want to enjoy pure \\"escapism\\" when watching a movie then this is a good one to see. The movie is good from start to shocking finish. The movie is full of action, paranoia and pure excitement. I rented the movie but plan on purchasing it as it is very much worth multiple viewings.<br />I really enjoyed the movie and highly recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are short and mostly simple but I cant stop playing or trying to beat my high scores.<br />I only wish the points to open new games where lower
B006INDMEE|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. The acting by the entire cast was superb. The plot was superb and the ending was incredibly exciting. It is always good to see Helen Mirren in anything and this showcases her talent very well and also speaks well for the entire cast.<br />I rented the movie but consider it very much worth a purchase. Well done in every respect.
B000EUDAWG|1.0|This is Not a safe toy...not only scary but Not safe. A childs hair got twisted up in the wheels....a dime size hole of hair was pulled out of the childs head by this remote spider. I Would Not Buy or recommended to any one.
B006SV2LWA|2.0|This movie was simply not \\"fleshed out\\" enough. There simply wasn't enough movie to the movie. The acting was ok but the script was simply lacking. I don't really regret the rental but just barely. Not a very good movie and one has to question how they got the talent pool involved in this movie to participate. Paltrow and Damon have both appeared in a couple of \\"stinkers\\" in the past but it seems like Damon especially is on a roll as far as being involved in sub-par movies go. Perhaps his disenchantment with the performance of his political Demi-God, Obama has warped his ability to choose decent roles to participate with. Who knows? Perhaps the film makers just threw enough money at both Paltrow and Damon to make them not care what they lent their names to.<br />Not a very good movie at all.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game has a lot of great game options with an opportunity for even more games. It is a great app to have!
B000EHRVP6|4.0|I don't watch very many so-called scary movies. I find that most of them are way too predictable to be scary. In fact when I was a teenager me and my friends and sisters used to watch slasher movies like Friday the 13th just to laugh and make fun of them. But this movie isn't a slasher movie. I liked the beginning because it made the bad stuff that happened later seem even worse and much less predictable. How about those little kids? They were freaky and mysterious. They scared me almost as much as the grown ups. If you're in the mood to be scared this movie will scare you.
B004UID2LC|5.0|the touch is great and its a sick app love it. got a lot of fun videos and haven't had any problems with. wish I new more videos
B00511PTWM|4.0|This works great!  My husband has a charger for his phone that has the cord built into his cigarette charger so we each need a charger for our phone.  My car only has one receptacle so this solved the problem.  It was delivered on time.
B001AQO400|4.0|I just love this movie, it means a lot for me. This was for a gift for a friend, and he loved it too :D
1451627289|5.0|11/22/63 was the best book I have ever read!  Stephen King did an outstanding job at telling the story and even though it was the longest book I have ever read, I would have loved to have it be longer.  In most books, King will hop from place to place, but this one kept right to the path and that may be why I thought it was his best.  I would reccommend this book to everyone who enjoys the past.  Outstanding!!!!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|What more can I say about Adele? Just love every song, it mekes me cry, laught, think about differents things. Best music!
B006BDHAX0|2.0|Crashes towards the end of each puzzle every time, very frustrating. Otherwise game may be 4 stars for visuals and amount of puzzles
B005XQLBU4|5.0|great game that kept my interest. best on tablets though as it was difficult on my phone. great game though!
B0063IH60K|5.0|It flows very clean, and is better than playing it on my computer. I love playing it on my Kindle Fire
B005VTGB0S|2.0|i'm disappointed that this is promoted as being for an Ipad 2 when it doesn't accomodate the camera feature and the top power button isn't accessible when the ipad 2 is in the case.  It's great otherwise, just not for these two items.
0312641893|4.0|great book!!...fresh look on the Cinderella story. Loved it!! Can't wait for book 2 on the series. I believe you should read an excerpt on this book first then you most probably will buy it, like I did. Enjoy
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Adele is a wonderful old soul in a young, fresh and funny present incarnation, wise beyond her years with a charming, wry sense of humor... As much as she seems bemused and amazed at actually being at the Royal Albert Hall, she commands the stage perfectly, as as a consummate professional. Perfectionist that she is, at one point she even corrects herself by restarting a song which did not even sound off to begin with, because she felt she did not sound good enough. Adele seems to expect nothing but the best from herself, and she delivers in every way possible. She has a very infectious way about her on stage and her banter between songs is as entertaining as the songs themselves, making it very easy to enjoy every minute of this fabulous performance. Highly recommended... Fans will adore it and those yet to be swayed will indeed be swayed.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great graphics, great play. Hard to put down. My wife will not give it back! Easy way to burn a few hours waiting at the airport.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|just as fun as classic version. now has upgrades. graphics are so so. gets very challenging towards the end. 20 word minimum, how nice.
0393064476|3.0|The rediscovery of Lucretius' On the Nature of Things probably was a significant event. How the ideas of a Roman philosopher-scientist who believed all God to be irrelevant spread through an intensely Christian Europe sounds utterly fascinating. My problem is that I am passionately interested in intellectual history--the purported topic of this book. But Stephen Greenblatt apparently doesn't believe anyone could be truly interested in that topic. So instead we get a whole lot about the life of the guy who found the ancient text, one Poggio. I frankly do not care the least tiny bit that he had 14 illegitimate children. I am also not interested in a chapter wasted on the life of Lucretius, since in fact nothing is known about his life, and there are no facts here, only speculation. What I wanted to know when I bought the book--what the blurb on the cover and the reviews promised--was what impact Lucretius' ideas had once the manuscript was found and copied.  We learn that Machiavelli had a copy. Great. Did he buy the Epicurean idea that you should give up striving for fame and fortune? Obviously not. Did he interest himself in the concept of atoms? Greenblatt doesn't tell us. Did he give up Christianity when he read the text? We don't find that out, either.  In short, the book, while nicely written, is long on irrelevant details, and short on relevant facts. If you're really interested in what the subtitle offers, how the world became modern, you'll get much juicier information from The Scientific Revolution, by Lawrence Principe--in which Lucretius is little more than a footnote.
B005HSL626|5.0|Don't mind the ads personally (though if you have kids then just watch them in case of those racy ones) . Works fine on my Kindle Fire.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is the best game that I've played in a long time, this is a old time classic video game
B006JPS1OM|5.0|fun! I really am enjoying this app. I would definately recommend this game. to a friend. I I I I
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think the game is great. Sometimes the instructions are unclear... But overall I definetly think it was worth installing especially since it was free.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the plans are great. makes staying in the word easy and convenient. i appreciate all the Bible versions to choose from
B000002UTY|5.0|... to ask of those in the know.  I always thought the song title was \\"Cavalry\\" (which is certainly more related to a concept of Happy Trails) but have only recently noticed that it is called \\"Calvary\\" in most places (the place where Jesus died on the cross).  Does anyone know if the name is simply recorded wrong in most places, or if it is indeed Calvary?
0451450523|5.0|this item was on time and in perfect condition.  i ordered it as a gift and couldnt be happier. thx
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Simple idea but very good gameplay.  I would suggest to add types of missiles for attacker. 1 2 3 4.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is awesome,but if you are a prrfectionist,it might not be worth it.The graphics aren't the best and some of the game cost a lot of coins but, it is pretty hard and i like the challenge. it has arcade games and thinking games for all kinds of people.my favorite is air hockey.for all the games ive played there's been nothing wrong with touch sensitivity or force shut downs. and if u do stay on it for an hour u r devoted to the game and.u will cry about not having enough points to unlock any new games.i use this as a passtime at the doctors office or if i am waiting to meet with somebody. its not supposed to be addicting in my opinion.  i hope this.review helped your decision!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When my Lending Library refreshed, I chose The Hunger Games.  Over Christmas, I heard several people talking about how great the book was and that the movie is coming out in March.  I was told I would like the book, and that was correct!  This book was so hard to put down.  I really felt like I was in the arena with Katniss as she went through the Hunger Games.  I feel like I felt her emotions, and understood her conflicts.  I liked the characters she liked, and disliked the ones she disliked.  Now - this is obviously a young adult book, and it's not a work of literary fiction that will be read in High School English classes 50 years from now.  It's also highly predictable what is going to happen.  I figured from the very beginning that somehow Katniss was going to win the Hunger Games (after all, the book was told from a first person perspective), and somehow Peeta was going to live as well.  But, it was a fun and addicting read, and I can't wait to read the second book in the trilogy...and see the movie in March!
B0036T32LQ|1.0|This film's only virtue is the cute main character with the shorty shorts.  Uninspired story.  The only clever thing about it is they were able to make it cheaply by running the same footage, same scenes, over and over as if it's a mind-bender when, in fact, it is an ineffective gimmick for anything other than making a film cheaply.  Save your time and don't watch this film.
B005HV6Y84|4.0|I have only had a chance to listen to this soundtrack a few times... but so far I like it for the most part. It's great that they're not using the same artists over and over. But it's not as powerful as the Eclipse Soundtrack.  Although I love the remake of Flightless Bird/ American Mouth and Carter Burwell cleverly injected the movie theme with Bella's Lullaby.
B002ZG99A4|2.0|I knew this movie would be no brain entertainment.  But even knowing what it would be, it was worse than that.  I can't believe I am seeing 3,4 and 5 star reviews here.  If you can rent this for dirt cheap, I guess go ahead.  But for me (big Stallone, Stathem fan) it was severly lacking in all areas - looked like it was their first movie acting !  And now I see EXP2 is coming out - no idea how in the world that happens - rather just see a Rambo 23.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|create different stage sceneries and more upgrades to choose from this game will be out of this world!!! brings back childhood memories. pretty fun.
020161622X|4.0|While reading about things like using test driven development and Ruby in this book, I kept thinking that the book was a pretty fair summary of current trends, but nothing new.  Then I checked the copyright -- it was published in 2000.  This book was WAY ahead of the curve at the time.  It can be read in one sitting and it's worth a skim for pretty much every programmer, even if you don't agree with everything.  Highly recommended for new programmers.
B0028K31CE|5.0|Great condition - brand new; timely delivery; overall product - excellent; product content - although I'm a huge fan of Maxwell, I'm not sure why critics feel this is some of his best work.  I agree that 'Pretty Wings' is a wonderful song, his voice is exquisite as always, but he has other albums that I feel deserve another look.  Extremely satisfied!  Thanks Amazon!
B005D9B26E|1.0|This is why I Did not buy this set. An 8 Track of 5.1 songs . Hello Pete or Roger , in case you've forgotten this is a story lp with all songs conected. If nothing would have been released it would have been better.  Now there is no hope I or anyone else will see the full version released in 5.1. What a shame!!!!!
B00009AOBI|5.0|Classic movie!  Happy that I found it!  Movie in excellent condition; timely delivery; excellent price for a rare movie.  Overall, extremely satisfied!  Will always check Amazon stock before giving up on a search!  Thanks Amazon!

B004FLKV5O|4.0|One of the most beautiful lines in the opera is inaudable because the microphones were off.  Right before Donner's thunder gathering scene.  In English it's \\"Why do you wait, WOTAN\\"  you can't hear it. so beautiful,too.  4 stars not 5 for that ERROR.

B0029XIWCY|5.0|Billie Holiday / Lady Day: The Complete Billie Holiday on Columbia / 1933-1944 / The imported \\"Golden Years\\" budget version:<br /><br />Billie Holiday was a true vocal artists and this 10 CD set is fantastic.  I had the old \\"Quintessential Billie Holiday\\" set and this new version of those recording is far superior.  This imported \\"Golden Years\\" version is far less expensive than the U.S. version yet has the same recordings.  This is a Five Star set.
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|I enjoy a horror movie, that has a good plot. And is put together right.  There wasn't a lot of profanity, nudity, blood,  and gore. This movie is one of the best. John Carpenter, really out did his self with this one. The scene where the 2 ladies, went into the church. Looking for Father Malone, and he got up out of the shadows. Made me almost jump through the roof.
B0000A118M|5.0|John Coltrane / A Love Supreme:<br /><br />Personnel:<br />John Coltrane - tenor sax<br />Elvin Jones - drums<br />Jimmy Garrison - bass<br />McCoy Tyner - piano<br /><br />One of the greatest and most enjoyable albums ever made.<br />This one deserves a Sixth Star
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fantastic much more peaceful than other games I've played even at higher stages. Fantastic game. I cannot wait to play the next one.
B000002AH7|5.0|Miles Davis / Sketches of Spain (single disc, 8 tracks version):  One of the greatest albums of all time.  This is a brilliant reinterpretation of the traditional music of Spain done as Jazz.  The two alternate tracks added to this Single CD are a welcome addition and are much less intrusive than the 2 CD version of the album which has far too many unhelpful bonus tracks.<br /> This Single CD deserves a Sixth Star.
0385534639|1.0|I couldn't wait to read this book after reading the reviews and I felt like a failure when I lost interest and couldn't make it through. Then I came here and discovered I wasn't alone. Lots of pretty, shiney words strung together like the twinkling lights of the circus and just as superficial. Thanks for hosting these reviews they made me feel so much better. Maybe I didn't get it because there was nothing to get.
B000002I4S|5.0|John Coltrane / Giant Steps (with alternative tracks):  John creates a wonderful mood with this album as the tracks seamlessly move from demanding invention to mellow beauty.  The alternative tracks are a welcome addition.  Five Stars
B00371QQ0M|1.0|Ok This movie had little to do with the books.  Thufir you need to keep this cat alive.  Baron I love your diseases, heart plugs, really?  No swords, weirding modules? Rain in the open desert, sure kill the worms, the over working \\"The sleeper has awaken\\".  If you love Dune you'll likely hate this.
B000002I53|4.0|John Coltrane / My Favorite Things (Atlantic - original 4-song album on CD):  These are very nice versions of popular songs and the album is very enjoyable, but it's not a classic.  This is a nice Four Star album.

B000005H7D|5.0|John Coltrane / Blue Train (enhanced version): These tracks define Jazz of the era.  This CD has superior sound and the alternative tracks are a welcome addition.<br />This is a Five Star album.  Highly Recommended.

0307593312|3.0|Long-winded and ultimately disappointing, I'm still glad to have read 1Q84. Murakami's talent for presenting unoriginal ideas in uber-unique ways using simple, easy-to-read language is unparalleled, although perhaps I'll proffer Ishiguro's novel Never Let Me Go as a strong second. Note to self: Need to read more Ishiguro.<br /><br />Where Murakami fails, in my estimation, is the sterile, matter-of-fact narrative that kept me from emotionally investing in the characters' fates. I'll agree with other readers who posit the clinical feel of Murakami's prose as deliberate, even essential to the novel, but I'm a romantic at heart who enjoys a hearty laugh, sheer terror, and a good cry -- not all in one book, but one or more of them perhaps once or twice in the same book would be nice.<br /><br />The state of perpetual wonder I felt throughout this novel, in awe not of the ideas presented but in the application of those ideas -- air chrysalis, anyone? -- simply wasn't enough to be the satisfying read I was hoping for.<br /><br />Lots of hot air, here. The novel could have been significantly shorter. In particular, I'm thinking of a third character who seems not to have earned his own series of chapters. I wonder what, if anything, might have been lost in translation?<br /><br />Recommended for Murakami fans.
B001UV4XUQ|5.0|love the digital copy, now i can torture my boyfriend to watch this movie anywhere we go on my ipad. haha! anyway, as i remember, the movie came very quickly, nicely packaged etc. just as you would anticipate. best movie, ever.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I just got these headphones today (MDR 7506). They are as good as the reviews say they are. Honestly! I just have one problem, and I am not sure if it is a defect or a feature of these headphones: on some songs I am hearing a vibration on my LEFT ear (example: Most of the songs Norah Jones: Feel Like Home album). Just wondering if anyone here is experiencing the same issue or if I should send them back for an exchange. Otherwise phenomenal headphones. 4 stars because of this issue.<br /><br />UPDATE: After a phone call to Sony determined that headphones were defective. Sent it back. Just got the new pair. Very happy to report that they are absolutely flawless! No vibrations at all.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I am not a fan of Stephen King's book topics, but I am a fan of his writing. He is exceptional and rich in his style, and this book does not disappoint. I rarely read his books anymore, but this topic fascinates me so I gave it a run.  IF YOU HAVE NOT READ IT: I will pass on the \\"synopsis\\" since so many have done it. The time travel topic is classic and can go on almost any path since it is not real, but this one was unique to me. The idea of entering a time travel option that has a \\"reset\\" button is interesting and unnerving all at once. The settings are interesting and the characters have really good depth. I felt like I could relate to George and his goals and dilemmas. It is hard to say that because of topics in the \\"IF YOU HAVE READ IT\\" section. If you are contemplating reading this, just answer these: Do you like time travel that is fairly \\"realistic\\"? That means you like the idea of time travel, but it sticks to time based rules, has continuity and is not a total free for all. Do you like the JFK concept? and can you deal with questions unanswered, dreams unfulfilled and deep emotional connections that will drive you batty? If yes, then you need to read this.  IF YOU HAVE READ IT: OK, I am about to sound negative but I really did like the book. I have read \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" and was very moved by it. In fact, I was sullen for a week because of the overwhelming ending. I also liked \\"Somewhere in Time\\" and appreciated its deep connections as well. I found 11-22-63 to be a mix of emotion on these counts, as it has a very unfulfilling ending personally, but at the same time makes a lot of sense and is really the only \\"good\\" ending. That Sadie would never actually know George and he had to live the rest of his life \\"knowing\\" is completely overwhelming to me. I loved the added touch that she felt a connection to him, but it is still heart wrenching.  I am not sure how he did it, but King made me relate to a character whose only goal is to essentially murderpeople prior to them being criminals. It reminds me of the Minority Report! Although we are trying to be altruistic in our view of George isn't he, in the end, the antagonist? There are some issues and unanswered questions. Why in the world did he write a script and bury it? That seemed very odd and disconnected to me. The relationship that he and Sadie had also was annoying. NO ONE ACTS LIKE THAT. That is what I kept saying to myself. Love is a splendid thing, but acting so over the top about being in love was almost unbelievable. He talked like a schoolboy about sex, communication and everything else with her. Come on. On top of that, he was a health conscious person now living with a woman that smoked two packs a day and the author doesn't even mention that he is bothered? I was waiting for him to say he now \\"loved the alluring smell of smoke thanks to my beloved.\\" A few other things were bothersome but overall I really enjoyed the story. It was not the impact that the \\"Wife\\" had on me but it certainly gives you a lot to think about concerning lost love or missed opportunity.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|exciting and colorful and not too hard for an old man like me.  lreally like the scoring.good luck the tiles are easily labeled

1400052173|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a remarkable book for several reasons.  HeLa cells are a long thread -like DNA in evolution- running through medical research since the 1950s.  As with the famous  E. coli bacteria, this cell line is also typically mentioned in introductory college biology courses, usually when the ironic and strange immortality of lethal cancer cells in culture is first explained to students. Moreover, even in a golden age of fine, semi-popular science writing, The Immortal Life of  Henrietta Lacks stands out ahead of most other science books.  The subject of the book shifts across a great stage, from cell to human to humanity.  It is in every sense a very well-written book.  The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks should be prized for both its subject and for excellence of execution.  I have worked with HeLa cells in culture in the research laboratory, back in the time when we only knew these derived from a \\"patient\\" and assumed we would never know who that person actually was. When this book was published, I was thus  intrigued by the information it conveyed and learned a great deal from reading numerous reviews.  The book went on my mental \\"must read\\" list, but alas, that is a very long list.  When the book came into my hands, however, I had turned only a few pages when I realized that this was a remarkable book which told a remarkable story.  It was compelling reading, and I recall how reading it occupied every spare moment for the next few days.  A wonderful book, it was also wonderfully disturbing in terms of some of the questions it put forward.  Although I specialize in the study of the relationship of science and religion, my broader interest in is the interaction of science and society as a whole.  One major point I try to drive home, both in my regular life science courses and in specialized courses such as \\"Science and Civilization\\", is that science is a human institution, and as such, deeply woven into the fabric of society.  Even \\"pure\\" research -knowledge sought for knowledge's sake- is not an abstraction set apart from human life; scientific research is never carried out in an amoral vacuum under some bell jar which excludes ethics.  This point should be particularly clear in medical sciences, but The Immortal Life of  Henrietta Lacks shows that even here, in what should be the most humane of sciences, science can easily become immoral when it seeks to be amoral.  This book is filled with instances which would be good jumping off points for discussion in any classroom.  For example, the cells were harvested without Ms. Lacks knowledge or consent.  That this was \\"customary\\" for the time is a point of historical fact.  While this is an explanation, it is hardly a solid defense, and it's disturbing that many people still don't understand this distinction.  In the Antebellum American South, it was also customary for white people to \\"own\\" black people.  As G. K. Chesterton wrote deftly and with great perception, this is like arguing that something is right on Tuesday but wrong on Thursday.  Of course, the appropriation of Henrietta Lacks' cells (however wrong) is not the equivalent of the high moral crime of slavery.  But the comparison still shows the kinship between the two immoralities, and the danger accompanying justification via a stance of moral relativism.  Moral absolutes are notoriously difficult to ascertain and bring their own burden of worries, but such relativism lies on a dangerous, icy slope.  Science needs and can withstand a critical eye, which functions like a healthy pruning performed on a tree gone slightly wild and awry.  Science and medicine are pursued with passion by practitioners, and are therefore hardly bloodless (in a good sense).  As in art passion is the engine which drives scientific inquiry.  So it is good to read a book dealing with science which tells the story earnestly and emphatically.  Tempering this passion, however, is the sadness at knowing a woman is dying, and will be lost to her family.  She resurfaces later, in their lives and now ours, in a manner which is wholly unexpected and troubling as well.  Yet on balance, there is some sweetness to counter this bitter taste:  her deadly cells bear her name so she will be remembered.  Even as \\"HeLa cells\\", we knew they came from a person who had fought a battle and died.  In this book, her face and life become clear and more and more distinct to us as we pass across the pages, like an old Polaroid photo slowing developing before our eyes.  By the book's end, the woman has become more than the cells, more than the letters \\"HeLa\\".  She is Henrietta Lacks.  To be mourned, to be missed.  Surely, Whitman will not begrudge the borrowing and bending of a line here.  \\"This is no book; who touches this touches a woman.\\"

0545265355|5.0|This was an awesome read!  One of those books that is hard to put down once you start reading . . . can hardly wait for the movie to come out!
0545403359|4.0|Although this is a children's book, I was curious to read it after seeing the movie trailer. A story told from the perspective of the horse, who is torn from his mother at 6 months old, sold to a farmer, and befriended by the farmer's son. The horse is sold by the farmer to the British Army during WWI and the son vows to find the horse. He is trained as a cavalry mount and goes into battle. He sees and tells of the war and its inhumanity to both humans and the horses and also the way soldiers fighting against eacch other sometimes show their humanity. I applaud the author for his use of the horse as his narrator.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i get bored easily and this game has a lot of variety. the games are also challenging but fun. great way to pass the time
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I enjoy using this app on my Kindle Fire. It gives me a lot of different versions of the Bible so I can use KJV in church and then pick something a little easier to read and understand for my reading at home. I can really enjoy studying scripture and have different versions to compare. It is a good idea to download a couple of versions into the Kindle Fire so you can use it when not connected to the web. Sometimes it seems a little buggy and doesn't always work really smooth, but so far I haven't had anything to make me not use it. It is worth a try and might just make you actually want to read the Bible from cover to cover.
0316056863|1.0|Was this book supposed to be funny?  Leave the comedic writing to someone who actually has an interesting life, like Chelsea handler!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Do not start to play this game when you have something else to get done. It is really addictive and you will not be able to pull yourself away from it. The graphics are great and it plays very well on my Kindle Fire. For a free game this really has a lot to it. Well worth a download.
0385738773|5.0|This is definitely not a leisurely read. There are no good stopping points. Clear your schedule before you pick it up, because you won't want to put it back down anytime soon.<br /><br />I never look at reviews until after I finish a book in order to fully enjoy the experience and form my own conclusions. Browsing through the reviews this morning, I was really surprised by the number of negative comments. Sure, there were some things that could have been done differently with better effect and some things that could have been explained more thoroughly and some things that grated on the nerves after awhile (such as repetitions of \\"I have a good feeling about this\\" or \\"he had to follow his gut\\")...BUT, ultimately Dashner produced a satisfying ending to the series. Embarking on a trilogy is often risky business for the reader, because you have to trust the author to make the investment worthwhile. And Dashner doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />**some spoilers**<br /><br />Because of the use of brain implants in the story, one thing that gave me pause early on was the possibility that Dashner might contrive a Matrix-like ending, where the characters were actually strapped into chairs with high-tech stuff connected to their brains the whole time and none of this was really happening. Surprise, it was all a manipulated dream. Turns out, I had nothing to worry about there. It's real. Oh, boy, is it real.<br /><br />Thomas does do a few stupid things that don't make much sense, the biggest of which is hanging around in the coffee shop after being warned to leave and then blabbing to the officer that he's a Munie. Huh? Why? And then he gets taken to a car which the guy proceeds to unlock with a key card, and a few minutes later, Thomas and his friends start walking to look for a cab instead of just taking the dang car. My daughter thinks the key card would only work for the officer, but this is never explained in the book.<br /><br />Also, it's understandable that he doesn't want his memories back when WICKED is in control, but then it's annoying when he still doesn't want them back when someone else is doing the procedure. Ditto when he refuses to let Brenda tell him about herself and the chancellor, especially after he wanted to ask her a few pages previously. It's like he spent 2-1/2 books wanting answers and the minute he has a chance to get them, he does an about face with no logical explanation. And the reader, of course, wants to shake him and demand that he get the answers. The memory issue would go off better if he was concerned that they had brainwashed him before and the memories could skew his current, undiluted perspective. Instead, he's simply afraid of facing what he did even though he has a pretty good picture of his role in WICKED anyway.<br /><br />Aside from such relatively minor gripes, The Death Cure proceeds at a breakneck pace with lots of twists and turns, leaving you guessing right up to the end about who can be trusted and who can't. There are plenty of shockers, too, like the \\"donate your brain to science\\" bit. Oh, wow. That was good.<br /><br />And coming full circle back to the Maze was a brilliant touch. Just brilliant. Seeing it as it really is with clear eyes, remembering how it was, and briefly reliving the horror of the Grievers. Yeah.<br /><br />Creepiness abounds with a distinct I Am Legend feel. The final showdown is intense and dramatic and inevitable. With the exception of one too-convenient death in order to avoid having the two characters come to terms with their past and their future (or lack thereof), the conclusion delivers. The last line is compelling, both within the context of the novels and as an example of how people in power delude themselves and those who follow them.<br /><br />**end spoilers**<br /><br />In summary, yes, there were a few sticking points, but nothing that seriously detracted from the overall effect. And the thrill of the ride canceled out the occasional bumps, earning a solid 5 stars. With regard to questions left unanswered, I felt that enough was implied to allow my imagination to fill in the blanks. Besides, the upcoming prequel will undoubtedly explain things in more depth.<br /><br />I really liked the premise of the series and how it could be representative of the world we live in: \\"Oh, oops, we 'accidentally' released this lab-created virus. It's going to be a pandemic. Gee, I guess you expendable masses will have to pay us billions of dollars for the vaccine, hehehe. And in case you don't want to, we'll get laws passed requiring everyone to be vaccinated--for your own good, of course. By the way, a lot of you may die, too, but believe us when we say it's all worth it so we can get richer because we can never, ever be rich enough.\\" Sadly, it's easy to believe the \\"powers that be,\\" with their fingers twitching on all sorts of buttons, already are or could get corrupt and arrogant enough to do the kinds of things depicted in this trilogy. Hey, maybe these people will read it and get a clue. The publisher could send complimentary copies to world leaders and scientific labs and pharmaceuticals everywhere. Wait. No. Scratch that thought. They might read it and get ideas instead.<br /><br />Let's keep this fiction...and great fiction at that.
0060574216|5.0|Last year, my boyfriend and I went through a difficult time. Nothing external, but we kept getting on each others nerves; I felt he didn't even want to be in the relationship, and he felt I was needy and emotional. One day he left to cool off after an argument, and came back with this book. He read it in two days, and I kept hearing these sounds of understanding come out of him. I read the book too, and it helped me have a deeper understanding of both him and me. We both started practicing some of the suggestion in the book; it really isn't difficult if you know what to do. He has become a wonderful listener! And I am not sure what I do better, but something is working because we got engaged last month! We recommend this book to all our friends; I bought 6 copies to give out as presents. If you are in a relationship rut, just go ahead and get the book. It may not necessarily work out with the person you are with right now, but these tools will help in any relationship, even same-sex relationships.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app has alot of translations and languages and reading plans. It's my favorite Bible app on Android. Several reading plans are from blue letter Bible - the most awesome Bible site!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I've never been so emotional reading a book series than the Hunger Games series. I am in love with this series, it's hard to say but I think I actually do like it better than the Harry Potter series. It is a must read and I recommend it for anyone.
B0059XTTW8|2.0|Save for the denouement, this was a film lacking in most every department. MI6 included.   A woeful screenplay and limp direction conspired to deal a heavy blow to what was the most powerful novel of its genre.   I, for one, had been terribly excited at the prospect of seeing Smiley brought to life on the big screen again. What puzzled me, however, was how Tinker Tailor could have been diluted to just two or so cinematic hours. I need not have worried; the attempt was a dismal failure and most likely was always going to be.   But, in the hands of this director what we did get lacked substance with what appeared to be a hurry-along to explain as much of the convoluted plot in the smallest amount of time possible.   This inevitably led to some odd and quite unrealistic scenes. The strength of both the book and the mini-series was that the reader/viewer could not possibly question what it was that Le Carre wanted us to believe. Not unless one had been a secret agent of course.   More surprising was the utter dilution of Karla. It may, or may not, be integral for the audience not to understand how mysterious and shadowy a figure Le Carre intended him to be. However, his presence in Budapest diluted and undermined very much the psychology of both Smiley and his Russian opponent. A bridge built, perhaps, for Part Three?  At the risk of seeming to be too picky, Ricky Tar's call to Lacon which ultimately kick-starts the whole kerfuffle is artistic licence gone completely balmy. I almost laughed out loud.  The film smacked of implausibility throughout.   Not only that, it was a complete mess.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games are pretty fun,  the challenge to open new games keeps your interest.  I generally play simulation games. overall, I have not erased it yet and it does help pass a little time here and there.
1400052181|4.0|It's amazing to say this was an easy read, and I learned something totally new. While it was an interesting perspective, I thought Skloot was able to easily connect to readers the same way she connected to the Lacks, with honesty and curiosity. She was able to explain the life and story of Henrietta without sounding like a history book, but sounding like a friend over coffee. She even encouraged the internal debate, I can't believe that happened then, I can't believe that could as easily happen now, after signing a few papers, that most patients don't read, and in the Lacks case, probably couldn't read, not to their fault. However, I understand the argument that science and medical testing must continue to advance in that field, to make sure we have longer, healthier lives, to encourage the next big discovery. It is certainly an intersting struggle.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|You'll find the discription writen for this book is FAR OFF, but what you'll find is something far greater than the product discription. I recomend it for any hopeless romanic (like me) or anyone looking for a differnt kind of suspence all together. I find it refreshing when a book isnt as I expected, but BETTER. So many twists and turns your constantly intrigued. Not your normal fairytale romance, but who likes those anyway?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is really really fun I like all the games I could play it all day if I was not at school
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like the versatility of this app.  There are so many devotional and reading plans to choose from.  It is also easy to use.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it gives you tons of minigames. some challenging.and some you can get like that. I highly highly reccomend this app.
B00005JPGO|5.0|IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS DVD, MAKE SURE YOU  LOOK AT THE 2 DVD SET. THE SECOND DVD ADDS TO THE OVERALL  PICTURE BEHIND THIS GREAT MOVIE.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|This game is fantastic, I will give a brief description of the more pertinent aspects in suceeding paragraphs on why this is the case:  graphics:    The art style is reminscent of anime such as Cowboy Bebop, albeit in a modernised fashion.  The characters are drawn very nicely and the feeling of oppression and fear permeates through every histrionic pore of this awesome game.  Gameplay:    The point and click aspects of the game are at heart very simple, and the dialog provides good clues and hints as to where one MAY want to avert their attention.  There will be several areas where one will be searching in the same spot a few times over until the aha! moment occurs (both for the player and his or her on screen avatar) when this happens, it is quite satisfying and rarely feels like an impossible feat.  Sound:    The music matches the tone perfectly, conveying the sense of urgency felt by the characters.  Certainly one can appreciate the proper music for the appropriate situation. This is actually one of the better points of the game (although admittedly there are few low points).  Presentation:    Much like the graphics, the menus are quite good and easy to navigate.  The interface is fairly good but I don't think I've seen an option to customize controls (this is a bit of a pain for lefties like me, it got a bit annoying at times not to be able to hit R instead of L for the inventory screen to appear).  Either way, the characters are just as one would expect from an anime inspired and this is certainly a positive for fans of anime.  Story:    This is probably one of the strongest points of the game.  Essentially it's about 9 people who get kidnapped to partcipate in a game and need to find their way out of a ship.  I will spare you more details, but needless to say, while this may not be 100% original in terms of concept, the characters and dialog are hilarious and memorable (and in true anime fashion, they are full of histrionics).  I truly find this to be the pinnacle of conveyance in text based adventure/puzzle games.  So all in all, I'd say this game is about a 9.5/10.  I hope you enjoyed my review, and I hope you enjoy the game!
B004E547D8|5.0|This movie is so fun to watch!  We can watch it over and over again and still enjoy it just as much every time.  We love it!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|As the other reviews show, this game is really well done. Absolutely no lag. Wofks perfectly on  low-end phones. Dev invested more in game performance than in fancy graphics.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Awsome app, old school in concept but very smooth delivery. I like it much better than the old attari version. The key is building a solid strategy.
0316044695|2.0|This book covers an incredible story of heroism and tenacity that occurred when things became completely FUBAR on a seal operation. The author deserves all of the praise he has received, and then some, for the incredible actions he took during those days. Unfortunately, the book itself leaves a lot to be desired. By far, my biggest gripe is the near-propaganda spin of Marcus's raving tangents in the text. It seems that every chapter was 50% endless tirade. The story would be moved along for a few pages, providing gripping details, only to be derailed for the next five pages with ravings against \\"leftists\\", the \\"liberal media\\", and every other party not included in the far right wing. The author has a near obsession with these \\"leftist\\" straw-men, and it oozes from the pages. I very nearly stopped reading the book part-way through, but managed to stick it out by taking it in small doses, and simply skipping pages fueled with the anti-everything rhetoric. This book would have benefited greatly from an editor that knew what content was relevant, and what content was simply political speech made by an angry service member. As a reader, I just want the story. Keep your political beliefs and outrage at the direction you perceive the country to be moving in.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book to a friend. Needs more content, less rant filler.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I find my Kindle Fire to be versatile and a great tool to have. I just had major back surgery and it has been great for games, internet, email and books. I recently had a problem with my Sony Reader LCD readout and they wanted $23 more for a refurbished exchange than a new Kindle Fire. Guess which one I took. Amazon has the books and music I desire so I am completely happy.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|This review isn's actually about the death cure (ok book but needed a lot of questions answered for me to fully like it) but I was lookingat the death cure and was looking at the extras and it said: book 3 of 4. so i clicked on it and aparently Dashner is making a new book that takes place before the maze runner. maybe finally Dashner has noticed that our questions where still unanswered and he is finally going to answer them. ...just wanted to share that with you guys
B004O3YGMC|4.0|This is an incredible little app! I was totally blown away over how smoothly it ran. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't fully support my DROID Pro. In one of the command consoles I use, it won't let me type certain characters.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|title says it all. Recommended for anyone with a phone, a child, and a roadtrip planned! totally worth the price (free)
B005Y423ZC|5.0|the DVD was amazing. she did a mix of old and new songs.  her voice is just so perfect! loved that it came with a cd as well. must watch!
B000641Z90|5.0|Product arrived as advertised, and well-within the time period noted at time of order. This is a great video of Phil Collins !
B004VMUS9G|1.0|I don't know if its just my device, but every single time I've tried to use this app, it shuts down. This can create a lot of problems if the thing your timing is important. You're timing it for a reason.... if the timer never WORKS, then you have a problem. I don't recommend this app, at least not for the kindle fire.
1594744769|5.0|I stumbled across 'Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children' while searching for something else on Amazon, and the cover jacket intrigued me. I ordered it on a whim, and handed it to my husband to wrap and put under the tree for Christmas. I spent a good part of Christmas Day totally absorbed in the story and finished the book that night. The unique pairing of the quirky, vintage photographs to help illustrate the story was a brilliant move on the part of the author. Part fairy tale, part love story, with Harry Potter-esque elements, it was a very satisfying read. I am 47, but would recommend this story for anyone age 11 to 100+. Descriptive, and more suspenseful than scary, it is a believable fantasy to get lost in on a cold winter weekend.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|i liked this game but it would just shut down my game over and over i would start a new game and it would. do it again. uninstalled out of frustration.
B005I6EU48|5.0|The cover was unique and the workmanship was terrific.  As an avid reader who has made the transition to an eReader, I loved the look of the \\"old world\\" leather book.

B000007XUQ|5.0|[[ASIN:B000007XUQ Christmas Collection]]  New appreciation for Richard Carpenter as producer/arranger - so beautifully layered and detailed, but sounds effortless.  These 2 combined Xmas albums flow musically and thematically from song to song - all the Christmas classics and much more.  Karen Carpenter's rich alto tones, vocal control and interpretive emotional power remind us why her legacy lives on.  \\"Little Altar Boy\\" a new favorite of mine.  Album notes are thorough and interesting - every song mentioned.  A gorgeous, delightful, chock-full 2-CD set that you will listen to again and again.  I'm giving several next holiday as Christmas gifts.  The best classic Christmas music collection, in my book.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I did not know Steve Jobs all that well. While reading, I found myself wanting to sell the iPad I was reading the book on. He really wasn't a nice person. But he was a genius. And this book portrays him well I believe. A great read.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun games! it is fun to unlock more with how good.you get. I will recommend. this game to all of.my firebrand.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|reminds me of N64 missile command.  lots of fun.  I could get addicted to this game.  glad I took advantage of the free deal.  I love going back to my early days of video games.

B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game . It's simple, yet challenging. The graphics aren't flashy, but the look is crisp and fluid. I would recommend this game to players of all ages.
0525478817|5.0|I don't have much to say about this book, except that it's absolutely amazing.  It is, in my opinion and in the opinion of many others, John's best book to date.  It's funny, sad, philosophical and amazingly emotional.  I sat down at my desk and stood up six hours later having finished the entire book without realizing how much time had gone by.  I can't recommend it enough.
078689136X|4.0|I enjoyed the story and the murder plot. The book is a quick and easy read with just right mix of intrigue and sexual tension between the two main characters. If you are a Castle fan you will enjoy the book as well.
B006P96PAO|5.0|I have all the other movies that Sherwood pictures has made and each one gets better in quality but you have to look beyond that and see the wonderful message in each one. Courageous is a fantastic movie! I have never cried so hard or laughed anymore in a single movie. The message to fathers is timeless and needed very much in this day. It will make you think and move your heart. With all the filth and language coming from Hollywood today it is good to be able to watch a movie with your children (8 and up) and not make them cover their eyes or ears or ask them to leave the room or cringe while you hope they didn't pick up on the sexual innuendo the latest Disney cartoon movie slipped in to draw more adults. Like all movies you should watch it first and then decide if it is appropriate for your children. This one is well worth the time.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this app is amazing. u should get it. it looks 3-d!!! get it! it has no adds.it is amazing. please get it!!!!!!!!!!

B0064X7FVE|2.0|what's the point of a weather app with no radar. this needs to be fixed I dunno if its only my device or what but this app dearly needs radar added then it gets 5 stars.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|My toddler boys LOVE these. We just added them to the other Duplo sets we have and they always seek them out. Every tower they build has an animal soaring at the top \\"roaring\\" or waving down at the \\"world\\" below. The animals are easy to identify, and we say and spell \\"ZOO,\\" which is written on the back of the girls shirt, all the time. Fun, simple and a great add-on.

1594744769|5.0|I decided to buy this book because it was rated so good. I was not a bit disappointed with the story. I sucked me in right away.   I enjoyed Jacob's journey in meeting the Peculiars. His wonderful discoveries and learning that being Peculiar, is not so bad. :)  The photographs through out the book were fascinating. I love old photographs and I quite enjoyed how the author incorporated these old photographs into his most fascinating and peculiar story.   Definitely worth buying and reading again.
0486406482|5.0|Yea! I love this book I could read it over and over! I just think Emma is just such a strong woman and the whole book has this underlying witt that I just get a real kick out of...... hmmmmm, I think I'll read it again, now. :
B005KELS6Q|4.0|There are so many cases, sleeves and covers available for Kindles nowadays, that deciding which one is right for you can be quite a feat. The [[ASIN:B005KELS6Q Belkin Grip Sleeve Case for Kindle and Kindle Touch in Paparazzi Pink]] is a great case for someone on the go. Just slip your Kindle in the sleeve, zip it up and toss it into your backpack, purse, briefcase or bag. It'll help prevent scratches and other damage, without being bulky or taking up too much room. It also comes in three colors, so if Paparazzi Pink isn't your style you have the options of Infinity Pool Blue or basic Black.

B004TTMYQG|5.0|Of the handful of calendar apps I've tried with my EVO, this is by far the best. It offers plenty of customization, and the best widget I've come across. Entering events is much better than with the default Android calendar. This app also has a number of intuitive features that make navigation quick and easy. Lastly, I should mention that I've never had a single technical issue with it.  In summary, I highly recommend this app!
B00008OLYN|4.0|I don't own anything else by this group but I really like this album. I guess this album is completely 180 from their other heavier stuff, but this is a great CD!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The YouVersion app is super easy to use, and gives me full access to any version of the Bible that I want to read.  I especially like the audio component, as do my kids.  My husband and I use it to do our nightly Bible reading/listening.  I just wish every version on the app had the audio component.  Hopefully they will add it.  Occasionally a section of scripture will highlight when I don't want it to, but it is easy to fix and I still like having that option.  I use YouVersion every day, and I fully recommend this app.
B00005UEAR|4.0|The last good Dream theater album made. This double CD takes you on a musical journey the way they can, and do really well at.

B000PFUAO6|1.0|Dream theater is good and they ARE BETTER than this material that they made. It seems a little too much and as if they're trying to hard to make music still.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Supported by ads, some games are very easy, others not so much. Controls can be touchy on some games but a lot of fun overall.
B0009A1AS2|1.0|Dream theater again trying to hard to write good music. This album doesn't have the feeling that their previous albums have.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Play this great app. Has tons of games and is a challenge to defeat them. I hope you have fun!
B0000CDLA7|3.0|Ok dream theater nalbum. This album takes a different approach from previous albums and they are beginning to experiment with different writing styles. Worthy buy.
B001GM28HO|5.0|I love Lady Gaga's debut album The Fame. I bought it like almost 3 years ago. I have to say this it's pretty amazing. I danced to this album so much, when Lady Gaga became huge back in 2009. She did dominate 2009, thanks to her successful debut album The Fame. Yes, Lady Gaga is the new Madonna of today. I started liking Lady Gaga in late 2008, before she got noticed in 2009. I did see her on TV many times.  1) Just Dance (feat. Colby O'Donis) 10/10  2) LoveGame 10/10  3) Paparazzi 10/10  4) Poker Face 10/10  5) Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say) 10/10  6) Beautiful, Dirty, Rich 9/10  7) The Fame 10/10  8) Money Honey 10/10  9) Starstruck (feat. Space Cowboy & Flo Rida) 10/10  10) Boys, Boys, Boys 10/10  11) Paper Gangsta 10/10  12) Brown Eyes 9/10  13) I Like it Rough 10/10  14) Summerboy 10/10  I can't believe that her first album went 3x Platinum. Buy this album. It's awesome!
B000021XS0|4.0|Great Dream theater CD. Some reviews say this album Dream Theater reached their musical peak on this one and I agree. This is their best CD and has stood the test of time.
B001AACEP8|5.0|I like Katy Perry's first album One of the Boys. All of the songs are very good. I remember when I was in college a long time ago (during the end of the year of my first year in college), I heard her song \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" on the radio in 2008. It was huge in the summer of 2008, she did tour at the Vans Warped tour that year too.   1) One of the Boys 10/10  2) I Kissed a Girl 9/10  3) Waking up in Vegas 10/10  4) Thinking of You 10/10  5) Mannequin 10/10  6) Ur So Gay 10/10  7) Hot N Cold 10/10  8) If You Can Afford Me 10/10  9) Lost 10/10  10) Self Inflicted 10/10  11) Still Breathing 10/10  12) Fingerprints 9/10  Katy was beginning to become huge in 2008. I miss the One of the Boys era days. :) I love this album so much.
B005EYP8PO|5.0|Double the fun. The original album was almost perfect and the extras are almost as good. Contiues the nice job they are doing on their double remasters.[[ASIN:B005EYP8PO Achtung Baby (2 CD Deluxe Edition)]]
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I like Kelly Clarkson's 5th album Stronger. I started to like Kelly so much and became a fan of her's, since she won on the 1st season of American Idol, and when her first song \\"A Moment Like This\\" played on the radio many times. So did her 2003 hit song \\"Miss Independent\\" played on the radio many times too in 2003. I own all of her albums. She's amazing!!!!!!! My favorite songs on her 5th album is Mr. Know it All, What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger), Honestly, Einstein, I Forgive You, Hello, You Can't Win, Don't You Want to Stay, and The Sun Will Rise. Buy this album. It's pretty good!

0525478817|5.0|In my opinion John Gren has completely outdone himself with this new book. He sets you up and then slowly breaks your heart in the most painful way possible. And you'll love every minute of it.
B000GOVU3G|2.0|This little movie suffers from depending too heavily on the narrative from Willie Morris' original memoir to carry it cinematically. Whoever storyboarded the film did the absolute minimum to move it along and failed to conclude the movie in even a remotely satisfactory way. Showing the grown-up Willie Morris leaving for Oxford without giving his beloved dog Skip at least a loving goodbye head-scratching suggests whoever put this film together has never loved a dog. Some will find the few scenes of cruelty to Skip disturbing, but I found it more disturbing to see Skip apparently pining away on his master's empty bed until he died. What other take-away are we left with in the end?<br /><br />The bright spot in this film, for me, was Frankie Muniz as the young Willie Morris. I would praise the complex evolution of the shy boy's relationship with the bullies, if it had not been for the unbelievable, out-of-sequence reversion in the end to the stereotypical bully remarks. I found plenty of little stereotypes to bug me throughout the movie. For example, the constant dripping of \\"chaw\\" down the youngest bully's chin was pretty over the top, not to mention that the character was an overly stressed caricature of the \\"ignorant hillbilly.\\" The evil moonshiners were cut out of cardboard. Kevin Bacon and Diane Lane as the parents were believable, but few other actors were. (How could they be, as poorly constructed as the movie was?)<br /><br />The period depiction of the small racially segregated Mississippi town was okay, but the happy gloss put on the living conditions of the Negroes (the term \\"Black\\" was not used back then) and the sterile non-depiction of racial tensions merely accentuated how thin (and, dare I say, dishonest) the whole thing was. Yes, this film was targeted to families with children, but that is no excuse for whitewashing history. It's okay to terrify children with graveyard ghosts and boogeymen moonshiners who'd kill a dog (and probably kids, too), but it's not okay to expose them to a little historically factual information?<br /><br />I wanted My Dog Skip to be good enough to watch with a friend who loves \\"Eddie\\" on Frasier, but I'm certain he would dislike the film at least as much as I did.s not okay to expose them to a little historically factual information?<br /><br />I wanted My Dog Skip to be good enough to watch with a friend who loves \\"Eddie\\" on Frasier, but I'm certain he would dislike the film at least as much as I did.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|My 6 year old loved it. It was easy enough to keep him from finding it too much like school work, but challenging enough to keep his attention so that he played the entire game in one sitting. Great job!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this app. is awesome. its is the most effect one I've ever had. I have to wake up early in the morning and it works great to get me up in a relaxing way and it  works way better than the one on my cell phone

0451232577|5.0|Like WAR HORSE, DOWNTON ABBEY, and BOARDWALK EMPIRE, we're dealing with a fascinating period during the early Twentieth Century. For those who love history, this is a riveting novel, bold in its solid attempt to cover this era so completely. Follett is a brilliant story teller. And I have been a fan since reading THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE all the way back in 1978.<br /><br />Whether Ken Follett is writing about a German spy during World War II or the history before, during, and after The Great War, World War I, he manages to bring his characters to life.<br /><br />I was hooked from the moment he brought me down into the Aberowen mine.<br /><br />His writing illuminates the thinking behind the world's entry into the first world war. From the arrogant aristocracy, to the humble working class families with little say about their lives or their prospects.<br /><br />Mostly, Follet illustrates the waste of ten million lives during the Great War. And how the war ended the reign of the aristocracy from England to Russia. At the end of this novel, he even foreshadows the rise of European anti-semetism, and Adolph Hitler's early popularity and imprisonment.<br /><br />If you love history and enjoy a great story, you will find this book to be pure pleasure.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty good game. not gonna lie its easy. I think a.lot of the games have been ripped off but still free and easy.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|I have never read any of the Tintin books. I have never seen any episodes of the cartoon. I knew nothing at all about Tintin other than he was a Belgian cartoon character (whose books were sometimes controversial) and I usually hate CGI films to boot.<br /><br />But once I got into the theater and was beginning to follow the story, I was soon on the edge of my seat! This movie is one long exciting adventure that will keep you on the edge of your seat! It has everything you can ask for in a movie of this kind: Likeable heroes (Tintin, the Captain, and Snowy the dog), Snidely whiplash style moustache twirling villains, comedy relief bunglers,  and TONS of adventure and action. In one film, you will see swasbuckling swordfighting pirates, French foreign legionnaires, animal fights, wild plane rides, harrowing motorcycle chases across some really great scenery. Oh what good old fashioned rip roaring FUN! I took my nephew to see this and it was like thrilling to Flash Gordon with my dad when I was a kid all over a kid. This movie will bring the adventure loving 12 year old out in the most serious of adults and you will stand up and cheer!<br /><br />Oh yeah, the \\"ending\\" (which I will not reveal here) will have have you yelling, \\"SEQUEL!\\" Guess we'll have to wait until around 2014.<br /><br />After seeing this, I plan to read some of the Tintin books and get the DVDs of the cartoon show, so if you love good clean thrilling fun (well, aside from the fact that the captain is a drunkard) of the Doc Savage/Indiana Jones school, I have two words for you-SEE IT! When the DVD comes out, bring your friends and their families over and make a fun evening out of it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|best game ever!!!!! I play it all the time every day all day long. and its got so many differents games that ur not always playing the same ones over and over again.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Thanks for the dvd. This is a good movie and the songs are great. It came in good shape and fast shipping.
0525478817|5.0|I am speechless- which is seriously pathetic because John Green has seriously- see I'm not even making sense.  This book- this book is my everything.  And I absolutely HATE sickness books. With all my heart.  But this book, John Green's gift to me, this was such an eye opener and I am so grateful he took the time (such a long, long time) to write such wonderful wonderfuls.  Oh, and he also signed my god damned book.  His pensive thoughts have certainly been expressed throughout the book and I felt as if I have gotten to know John's \\"deep\\" side.  You wouldn't tell that the guy who smeared peanut butter on his face for fun would write such wonderful wonderfuls.  Right- well, this reveiw sucked, and I can't exactly pour my heart and soul into a review, so you're just going to have to read it yourself.  John, you good hearted bastard, thank you for the best book I have ever read this year (I read lots of books, and I know it's only January).
0307887960|1.0|This diet may work, just like fasting will reduce weight, but it's a TORTURE! The author boasts all you can eat of 100 permitted foods, but the bottom line is that you can only eat; meat, fish, chicken, non-fat dairy, tofu, eggs and non-starchy vegetables - that's it! No normal person who enjoys life and food can endure this diet. Sure you will lose weight, but try to imagine going on for weeks or months without even 1 piece of fruit or a slice of bread, not even 1 pat of butter, no beans, no grains, no fats, no corn or potatoes, no nuts, no juice, no soda, no wine etc - I rather try something else; there are so many effective diets out there and the real deal is to eat less and exercise more and never forget to ENJOY LIFE!!!

B00631VJIC|5.0|This soundtrack is incredible!  I've been disappointed in the past when buying soundtracks, because many times the songs I loved most on the movie or TV show weren't included on the soundtrack ... but that's definitely NOT the case here!  All the best songs from the first four seasons of the show are included; listening to them takes me back to that particular scene/season.  A must-have for Sons of Anarchy fans!!!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Very fun game play.  Would definitly recommend.  Sounds can bother people sitting next to you, but other than that I've had no issues.

B006ANJ4BW|3.0|I enjoyed this film when I saw it in the cinema, and I've enjoyed it the couple of times I've seen it since on DVD. That said, it ain't as good as the original with Arnie!  Jason Momoa is an excellent Conan and brings him to life in a very different way to Arnie's. Momoa's Conan gets more out of the character, his charm, his brutality and his roguishness. Arnie's Conan is rather enigmatic. A lot of the time, stuff is happening to him, rather than him making stuff happening. For example, he doesn't escape his slavery, he is released. Momoa's Conan would have bust his way out and killed every one of his oppressors.  The beginning is perhaps the best part of the 2011 version. The egg chase is very well done (similar to the one in Rapanui)and the battle with Kalar Zym's army is well handled too. However, the 80's version somehow did it better, with less guys and less effects. The middle of the film is ok as well, and its good to see Conan aboard a pirate ship, as per the Howard yarns. It's the end of the movie where it comes a bit unstuck and leaves you unsatisfied.  The 80s version had that fantastic bloodbath battle at the standing stones, and Conan's 'Da hell wid you!' speech to Crom. This one has a lot of scrappy swordfights in tunnels with the main villains. Where did their armies go? The villain's pay off is weak too. Having achieved his magical ambition, he never gets to flex his muscles, raise a zombie army, call up a horrible demon, any of that stuff. Which is a pity.  Design wise, the 2011 version is very nice, but not as good (sigh) as the 1980s version. John Milius spent a lot of time trying to get the 'historicity' of Hyborea right, and he achieved it very well. I couldn't help but miss Arnie's standing stones battle armour, which had just the right look to it. In a way, I think that all the action sequences in this film should have happened in reverse order, small fight to large battle, still with a tentacled beastie in the middle.  Hopefully all the crappy reviews this film has received won't prevent more films of this nature being made, but I suspect it may, at least for the present. Then again, Clash of the Titans got smashed and that got a sequel.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Game is straight forward and fun.  Works well on Skyrockets GS2.  Would recommended if you need some time to kill.  Does not require more money to make the game more fun to play.

1936850028|5.0|Having skiied 30 Birkies myself, I find Walter Rhiens book \\"Beyond Birkie Fever\\" to be the best account of what cross country skiing and the American Birkiebiener mean to myself and to the thousands that either ski the race each year or are associated with it.Rhien's whitty descriptions of training, events associated with the Birkie, and his account of how the race unfolds to the citizen racer is \\"RIGHT ON ACCURATE\\". As the book unfolds, I can envision myself in many of the exact scenarios' that the author describes chapter after chapter! The interview with Birkie founder Dave Langraf is even more special. Dave was a a personal friend of mine who was killed in a bicycle accident last August. Having that interview in print will always help me remember what Dave did for skiing, the Birkie, and how much I miss not having him here with us! \\"Beyond Birkie Fever\\" is a must read for any cross country skiier aspiring to ski the Birkie itself or for the thousands who have skiied North America's greatest nordic event.<br /><br />This next part of the review was done by a student of mine who read the book.\\"As soon as I read the first paragraph I knew that I wanted to ski a Birkie. The details in the book were amazing, it made me feel like I was in his shoes sking the races, from the American Birkie to the Kangaroo Hoppet. The book read smooth, like a hot butter knife going through butter. His details were amazing, they were so good an elder person but smooth enough to be read by a 6th grader.(Quincy Stephens)
0307279189|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my brother; he LOVES it! For someone who is serious about running, this book (according to him) provides a unique perspective. He is not necessarily looking for a training guide as he is already very experienced. However, this book seems to be a great inspiration as well as educational.

B004ZN9YNC|3.0|Okay, let's go on record and say I have some issues with this album. More than this being a \\"Roger Waters solo album\\" yadda, yadda, yadda. This album is a very heavy album, and I don't mean in a rock sense that it has a heavy sound, no, this album weighs heavily on the listener. The themes are dark, brooding and at moments depressing. I mean, seriously, the back cover has a picture of a soldier with a knife in his back. What kind of tone does that image set for you?  I often tell people that after listening to The Final Cut you are posed with a very important decision : 1) to off yourself or 2) find yourself stronger from the experience.  Does it mean I hate this album? hardly. I do enjoy the album but in small doses. Musically, it's quite good. But it's hardly Pink Floyd. The reissue sounds fantastic, but I have a problem with the inclusion of the song \\"The Tigers Broke Free\\". The song was recorded for the film Pink Floyd The Wall. I've always enjoyed the film and that song in particular, but I feel it was placed in the worst possible area on this reissue. Had they placed it elsewhere on the album or placed it as a bonus track at the end it would have worked. But to include the song right in between \\"One of The Few\\" and \\"The Hero's Return\\" makes piece as whole confusing and scattered.

B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Excellent quality in the dvd's: Happy to have the whole movie collection in a boxset.  I am a big fan of STAR TREK.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|The size of the unit shocked me, it's smaller than a godiva chocolate square. It has volume buttons and a power button that was roughly 5% smarter than me (hint: hold it UP for a few seconds.)<br /><br />It helps my music sparkle, so far. I can tell that it's bringing a lot of subtle stuff forward, but i will expand this review as i listen to more genres. I'm mostly testing the headphones i bought with this right now, but i'll throw on some sennheisers and Razer headphones, as well as some earbuds to see how they chalk up with this box.<br /><br />So: Good for now, possibly changing in the future for the better. We'll see!<br /><br />This is USB powered! i have no idea how you'd use this with an ipod.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />It has a built in battery that lasts a good long while.<br /><br />I rarely use it, because i rarely use headphones. It's great for music and movies... however i do not recommend using this to create/edit music... the sound is not \\"true\\" and you'll hear a really different sound once you put your creation on regular speakers. Not sure why this is the case.<br /><br />Overall a decent buy if your phone/mp3 player/computer can't drive your headphones well.
B0040IAZVM|5.0|I have listened to these recordings numerous times now and I like Clara Haskil's playing more after each listen.  Her Mozart is out of this world and her Schumann is excellent.  Please be aware that most of these are mono recordings so the sound quality may not be on par with current standards.  But the artistry of Clara Haskil is timeless.  This is a  fantastic collection that is to be treasured and passed on to your heirs.

B000A6EXNO|2.0|I agree with Patrick B.  I bought the DK-19 and the DK-21 to use with my D3100.  No screw ring included with either piece.  I'll try the glue.  Not a very elegant solution to a problem Nikon could fix by including a ten cent part.
B000VWOV3O|5.0|This set, along with its companion John McLaughlin volume, is a fantastic deal for anyone who doesn't have all of the material represented already -- the late 1990s/early 2000 remasterings of the classic albums INNER MOUNTING FLAME and BIRDS OF FIRE, upon which this group's reputation rests, plus the live BETWEEN NOTHINGNESS AND ETERNITY featuring that band, and the Mahavishnu Mk 2 efforts APOCALYPSE and VISONS OF THE EMERALD BEYOND, all at a bargain price. To be sure, most of the excitement in the group exited with Billy Cobham (and can be heard manifesting itself on his solo album SPECTRUM); and one wishes that the latter three titles could have been remastered as well, but that's another question for another venue. And they do sound good enough to these ears, if not as vibrant and close as the two classic albums -- and BETWEEN NOTHINGNESS AND ETERNITY has aged very well, indeed, even as a lesser effort by the original band. The CDs come without inner sleeves in mini-LP jackets which, in turn, are housed in a loose slipcase (so put a rubber band around the latter . . . .). The price is right for those who need the albums, and the music speaks for itself. Only the lost third studio album of the original band, from the Trident Sessions, is not featured here, which would have made this absolutely perfect (although, in a truly complete Mahavishnu box, someone would have retrieved the group's early 1970s appearance on ABC's In Concert as well, but that's another issue for another time and place).
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love having any version I like available to me in this easy to use Bible. It allows you to choose from several different reading plans and so I have the the living Bible for reading for content; and all the other versions if I want to go deeper. It is easy to move from one version to another. I sometime have trouble getting the bookmarks in place, but when you open it each time it takes you to your lastpage.
0060873027|4.0|While not written very well, its definitely interesting and deemably satisfying.  Its written like a teenager or beginner might write, 'telling, instead of showing' and other flaws. But it was quite good and was a great way to kill time and learn a little science (all Crichton books are good for learning science, maybe not so great on story, and certainly not characters).  But this is one of the more exciting Crichton books, quickly becoming intense (most of his books have long build ups).
0385520298|5.0|My Chinese girlfriend and I have read this book together. It has given us fantastic insight into differences between our cultures as well as lots of interesting topics to discuss.

1439102813|4.0|I remember reading several reviews here on PBT about Still Alice, and I thought the premise was interesting enough so I got this book TWO years ago. It's been on my tbr, and I can't believe I left it there for this long. I was so captivated by it that I started it yesterday and finished it today.<br /><br />Still Alice is told through Alice Howland's viewpoint: a 50 year old celebrated linguistics professor at Harvard who was recently diagnosed with early on set Alzheimer's. Alice suspects that her recent memory lapses might have to do with menopause, but when the symptoms don't add up, she is diagnosed with EOS Alzheimer's. The challenges she faces as she gradually loses her memory are chronicled in an almost, but not quite, diary like form. Her family's reaction: her husband's and three kids and her own plans for her future seem very realistic.<br /><br />This book left me feeling somewhat scared. I mean, we all read how keeping a healthy, active lifestyle helps in keeping Alzheimer away. How being alert, and challenging yourself with new things and playing sudoku (or anything for that matter) fends it off somehow. And then you have people like Alice. They lead such a life and it doesn't help. Gene mutations, or the food that we eat, the pollution..there are just so many causes.<br /><br />***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***<br /><br />John infuriated me. At first, I tried to sympathize and assumed he was in-denial. But it became apparent that, that wasn't the case. The conversation between John & Alice, when he told her he wouldn't ask her to take a sabbatical if it were the other way round, and then she answered him \\"you wouldn't have to\\". That completely made me want to kick some sense into his thick skull.
0345529057|4.0|George Martin has a great authorial voice, authoritative and engaging.  His writing style is consistent and even over a very long set of books that bulks in excess of 5000 pages, and his characterization is sharp and always interesting, even in the characters you don't like.  His fantasy world of Westeros is richly detailed and vividly realized, and his plotting keeps things moving.  For 2,500 pages I was wholly engrossed in this world, but by this point some nagging problems in the series caught up to me, and I'm now taking a break from these books.<br /><br />Westeros, for instance, is one hell of a bleak place.  Martin dwells on the grim, the harsh, and the ugly to the exclusion of just about everything else.  There are no true good guys herein, just deeply flawed central characters and various shades of disgusting villains.  After several thousand pages of having my face rubbed in the sordid miseries of virtually everyone in the book and the sorrows of Westeros in general, I got tired of it.  Just about everyone herein is either savage to begin with or develops a vicious side as the story progresses, and after a thousand pages of this I realized there wasn't a single character to root for.  One settles for simply observing the horror of Westeros as it unfolds, and eventually you say, \\"Why would anyone bother to fight for such a loathsome place?  What does anyone see in it?\\"  The answers he supplies work, in an overly-specific way:  honor, family, fealty, courage, love (of sorts), but when all these intangibles exist in a cesspool, it's hard to value them very much.<br /><br />Other people I've talked to about this series also crapped out in book 3.  The ruthlessly political viewpoint drives everything else out of the story, and after a few thousand pages you don't just yearn for balance but require it to keep reading.  Or, you take six months or a year off from it, and then hold your nose and plunge back in for a couple thousand more pages.  Overall this series of books is very, very well written, but its grindstone of a viewpoint makes it hard to tolerate, after a while.  Read in small doses!ry well written, but its grindstone of a viewpoint makes it hard to tolerate, after a while.  Read in small doses!

B000ONBWSW|5.0|I purchased this book for my eldest son who is an avid reader.  It also gives me occasion to read the delightful stories nightly to him and his younger brother.  Although they both have Kindle Fire electronic readers, they very much appreciate old printed books like this one, which was published the year of Doyle's death in 1930.  The visceral connection to the past afforded by a noble old book can still be enjoyed even in this electronic age.  In that context this book is perfect in that it is both connected to that era, and contains the complete works of all of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories.  I heartily recommend it.
0240815807|5.0|This books ranges from what I would call a Low Intermediate level and up. As a beginner a few concepts left me re-reading section but hands down the best book I have read on the subject thus far.   Its a must buy.

1451627289|4.0|I admit this was my first Stephen King novel (although I've seen several movies based on his books).  I've always been intrigued by stories about time travel, if they are done in an interesting and not corny way.  Of course, since physicists tell us time travel into the past is virtually impossible -- any story involving this phenomenon is pure fiction and can go in any direction the author chooses.  It's perfect willful suspension of disbelief, and Stephen King pulls you into his interpretation -- every journey goes back to September 1958 and re-sets all of history from that point on.  It's a cool, mind-bending idea that keeps one guessing throughout the book exactly where and how King was going to end it.  He certainly followed through with his thesis that the past doesn't want to be changed, and all hell will break loose if you meddle with it. I also was intrigued by the idea that someone would try to stop the Kennedy assassination, as I was in high school the day it happened, and it really was one of the darkest days in our life (as was the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, and the assassination of Bobby Kennedy in 1968).<br /><br />The book was long and extremely detailed about the everyday life of Jake/George and especially his relationship with Sadie, but except for a few repetitive interludes of the high school dances and fundraisers, it did not get boring -- a tribute to King's storytelling ability. (There were too many descriptions of Oswald's abusive behavior, however.  We got the point he was a wife beater right from the first, so drop it, already.)<br /><br />It was relatively easy to come up with a laundry list of all the possible ways Jake/George could be stopped from killing Oswald before the latter shot Kennedy, (bodily violence, car wrecks etc.) and most them were in the book.  I guess this is signature Stephen King but I'd hoped for some more imaginative devices.  But King did a good job with the suspense for what actually did happen when the pivotal encounter took place. What happened afterwards?? It was pure \\"choose your own adventure\\" -- I could think of a dozen ways he could have taken the story, but didn't predict the one he took.  I had wondered if King would come up with an alternate rendition of history after 11/22/63 and he did and it was darkly amusing.<br /><br />My husband and I listened to the audiobook read by Craig Wasson, and the latter does a great job with the multiple voices and regional accents.  The only voice I wasn't enamored of was the Sadie Dunhill voice -- too deep and twangy.  All I could picture was a middle-aged battleaxe type librarian not a sexy young woman. Maybe it was the voice, but the character just sounded and acted more like a 50-year old than a 28-year old, in the story. It was hard to tell Sadie from Mimi and Ellie -- two other important women in the book who were both elderly.<br /><br />The ending of the book was appropriate but I was troubled by the transformation in Jake/George from being a do-gooding hero to basically, a burned-out cynic.  I guess time travel does that to you, at least in King's version.  Still, I congratulate him for writing a fun and thought-provoking piece of fiction.. What happened afterwards??

B0058EBNAO|4.0|Works great on my HTC Thunderbolt. Updates automatically or manually and shows good information. I have used other weather apps and this is my favorite.
B00003XAVA|5.0|What a beautiful record-the music is orginal and timeless!!!! Highly recommend- Carry Me-opens this album written by David Crosby-it's melody as well as it's lyric are deeply meaningful. The listener is provided with deep insight and wisdom.All of which stem from the writers self reflection and ability  to be  creative  enough at the time to put it all to music.David Crosby's vocal along with  Graham Nash's harmony is truly original and amazing.Together with the talented cast of musicians it is all brought to life! Mama Lion-Another beautiful Graham Nash composition who's lyric describes a love for a women who is struggling with two natures -her spiritual nature and her animalistic nature. It is this irresolvable struggle that comes with a high cost for both -leaving him grieving the loss of their relationship. The song is sung with frustration and great concern. The song is successfully realized by both Graham Nash's great vocal and David Crosby harmonizing. Again the musician work on this song is just amazing. Bittersweet-Here we have a rare appearance of David Crosby on piano, Carole King on electric piano.A  very emotional song of sadness and frustration. The sadness of two people who have separate issues that conflict with the potential of their relationship.The frustration comes in the form of a question, that often accompanies such awareness. All these feelings are brought to life through the  emotional vocals of David Crosby and Graham Nash. Take The Money and Run-Another Graham Nash song addressing the anger that one feels when one has been betrayed and taken advatage of.The musicians that bring this song together do a wonderful job-David Lindley's violin arrangement only enhances the character of the song. Naked In The Rain-A beautiful song about the struggle of one's failure to maintain a facade and the realization that individuality, even if it means not keeping pace with your companions,is vital- for one's sanity depends on it. Beautiful vocal by both David Crosby with Graham Nash harmony accompaniment. Love Work Out- A Graham Nash composition dealing with the frustration of what hard work it takes at keeping a relationship together and maintained.The guitar work on this song is powerfully unprecedented! Its as if there are four vocals accompanying this song Graham Nash, David Crosby, Jackson Brown and the strong guitar work of Dan Kortchmar and David Crosby which magically creates a fourth voice and vocal. Low Down Payment-Another great David Crosby song.Its a warning song about how obsessive self-importance can desensitize one from the world in which one lives to point of ignoring  those most close to you,only to end up feeling regret that turns into debilitating guilt.Very moving melody. Cowboy Of Dreams- Another Beautiful Graham Nash song. Its a song in which its writer describes experiences that causes him to reflect on how the way he lives his life effects his fellow man and a feeling of frustration for those who ignore this fact. Leaving the writer feeling a great concern for the future. Homeward Through The Haze-Another musical David Crosby Gem,profound lyrics and beautiful melody. Fieldworker-An empathetic Graham Nash song at attempting to put into words and music the overwhelming oppressive and exploitive life and employment of migrant workers. Critical Mass-An inexpressible musical experience.Listen to this and you'll understand why Graham Nash and David Crosby were once considered two of the greatest harmony singers of all time. Wind On The Water-One of the most emotional ecological songs ever written.Graham Nash's vocal (together with David Crosby and James Taylor's harmonizing) is beautiful as it is haunting.Its lyric and melody are a passionate plea for the way we as animals treat other animals and their habitat on this planet.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I can't seem to understand how so many people could give this movie such a horrible review. There's nothing wrong with this movie. David Bowie is amazing and the acting is also amazing. Also the music is easy to sing along to and it keeps your interest no matter what part it is of the movie. When I end up having children, I wouldn't hesitate to play this movie for them and even watch it with them. I was a slight David Bowie fan and then my mom asked me if I wanted to watch some of her VHS movies. I saw Labyrinth and after watching the first 10 mins, I looked at the box and thought \\"oh wow! I knew that had to be David Bowie :3!\\" and sure enough, I have watched it numerous times over and over again. I finally decided I should get it on DVD so I didn't destroy the VHS. The DVD has not yet arrived as I am writing this review early instead of waiting for the DVD. Movies with puppets and surprises are always an interesting time to watch. But my favorite thing in the movie is David Bowie's \\"catch phrase\\" of \\"Such a pity\\" XD. And he's always on Hoggle's case and mispronouncing his name. Oh and always threatening to dip him head first in the \\"bog of eternal stench\\". Anyone who can say such negative things about an OLD movie from the 80s is either crazy or stupid. Possibly having NO taste in an 80's puppet kids movie.

B005XQLBU4|4.0|Kind of old school. It's really fun and works perfectly on my Optimus S. Thanks for the free game amazon.<br />Edited to add: It ended too fast.
B006MGDIAA|5.0|What I mean by \\"there's never enough \\" is that:  1) Amazon doesn't have enough stars to rate this book, I mean 5 is way too little for the value this book has!  2) Even experienced and good programmers , with all their extended knowledge, still do not have enough knowledge to be entirely satisfied. This book is certainly going to add one more drop to every developer's satisfaction cup. Definitely for all programming categories: from rookies to experienced.  I encourage you to buy this book! It's worth every penny!  Have fun coding!  Cheers!
0064440346|5.0|We've been reading this book almost every night since we got it last week. My 7 year old can't get enough of this silly owl. There are 4 or 5 stories within the book, each one is unique and displays Owl's charming naivete. My daughter's favorite is Teardrop Tea in which Owl thinks of \\"sad\\" things to induce tears into a kettle so he can heat them up and have teardrop tea. These sad things include chairs with broken legs, spoons that have fallen behind the stove never to be seen again, and books that cannot be read because some of the pages have fallen out. Another story has the nutty Owl contemplating how he can be upstairs AND downstairs at once because he likes both places so much. In another story, Owl flips out when he sees two bumps at the foot of his bed, which turn out to be his feet, but he never does figure that out and finally goes to sleep downstairs where he says he'll be \\"safe\\". Little kids should get a kick out of how daft Owl can be at times, but it's in a loveable way. He's found his way into our hearts and we look forward to reading more Owl books!
0375836675|5.0|The extraordinary is concieved and delivered, through a little bit of courage and faith, in the otherwise dull and mundane. This is the message in Mr. Zusak's sweet and enormously pleasurable tale of Ed Kennedy, a painfully average nice guy who is suddenly snatched from a life of lazy, self-centered repetition and thrust into an existance outside of himself. As Ed stumbles along in his journey, Mr. Zusak effortlessy invites the reader along as we, with Ed, experience new levels of understanding, tenderness, sacrifice and companionship. In I Am The Messenger, the author creates a fun enviornment that oozes with comfort and kindness, all welcomed feelings in this fully engaging and satisying novel.
B003FSTN52|5.0|Love julianna!! this is a great show.. great cast.. and it just gets more interesting as you go.. motivational at times reminds you whatever your going thru keep your head held high!! the only thing i dont like is \\"BIG\\" FROM SEX N THE CITY plays her husband.. im not a fan, he drives me nuts..
B000I0QL82|5.0|This movie is one of my husband's favorite movies to watch around Christmas. We didn't have a copy, so I surprised him with one. He was happy with the surprise. We all enjoyed watching it together, and it was nice to show my sons who Fred Astaire was.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I liked this app the games are fun and keep me interested when I'm bored five four three two one
0545265355|5.0|Loved this series! Ruthless and scary future.  Not for the feint of heart.  Read them in a week.  Can't wait to see the movies.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|I will admit, I was not looking forward to seeing this movie.  The trailer did not do it justice.  I suppose this is not the first time I have judged a book by its cover and decided something was awful before every really giving it a chance.  And it is not the first time that I have been completely wrong.  I LOVED this movie.  First off, and without question, it is visually stunning.  Zack Snyder sure can paint a pretty picture.  I thought the CGI was perfect and the atmosphere totally pulled me in.  If you like steampunk you will certainly enjoy this movie.  Secondly, being an action fan, I was not at all disappointed with that aspect.  I guess the easy way to describe the action is by simply saying that it is COOL. Someone described this movie to me as one long music video.  That is somewhat an accurate description.  And the soundtrack is great.  Guess I don't understand all the hate that this movie has received.  Will it win any Oscars? Definitely not for the acting or the script, though those are not at all what I would call weak.  Everyone involved does a good job.  Perhaps most of the critics were like me and judged this movie based on the trailer without actually watching it.  I suggest watching it from start to finish before making any final decisions.  I think it is better than 300, which i felt was overrated anyway.  Just my opinion.  And as we all know, critics are often wrong and who really cares if it wins any awards?  I can think of numerous Oscar-winning and critically acclaimed films that, for lack of a better term, sucked.  And I can think of many films that were panned by mainstream critics and are excellent.  So if you watch this movie in its entirity and still feel its terrible then that is your call.  But give it a chance first, before deciding on the final verdict.
B004LWZW4M|2.0|From the opening scene of the 2011 film \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes,\\" I began to realize this was a shockingly average movie. The human characters are aggressively one dimensional, reacting as inanely as if they were starring in a Michael Bay disaster flick. These poorly written roles do just enough to serve the unimaginative plot, with the lead scientific couple (James Franco and Freida Pinto) appropriately young and attractive to appeal to teens. The performances of some usually very good actors, including Franco, John Lithgow and Brian Cox, are arguably the worst of their careers. And the film's portrayal of Alzheimer's disease is loudly offensive.  There are numerous ways this film could be improved, perhaps starting with a new writer (Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver) and director (Rupert Wyatt). \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" becomes interesting the very second the cartoonish humans are shunted to the side and it focuses on the imprisoned CGI apes. At this point I radioed, \\"Charlton, we've got a problem.\\" The special effects are a wonder, with the chimpanzee Caesar particularly fascinating (supposedly played by Andy Serkis, an actor who apparently is an expert in these computer-generated roles). His scenes with the apes at the simian prison are above average, and I loved the introduction of the circus-trained orangutan. How these apes ultimately escape from their cells and conquer - I don't know, San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge? - are the film's most exciting moments.  While this final conflict is entertaining and enabled the approval of millions of dollars in budget, it is also unbelievable and stupid. Why not just have the apes escape to the relative safety of the nearby redwood forests? Why have them battle helmeted policemen with guns and what is evidently the lone helicopter available? In brutal reality, if such an uprising occurred, the military replete with dozens of helicopters, tanks, armored cars, killer bulldozers and Dutch Schaefer, would comeout of the woodwork. The apes, in possession of nothing more than metal spears and a bad temper, would be mowed down like the Light Brigade.  Anyway, one of those corporate science labs movies love to detail has developed a drug that could cure Alzheimer's. A guinea pig-err-chimpanzee is showing remarkable intellectual development. For whatever reason, she's in a bad mood, breaks through numerous windows and doors and amazingly lands on the board room table before shocked executives at the exact moment they discuss the project. Of course, a security guard shoots the maniac chimp dead. Turns out it wasn't the new drug at all but a newborn baby she was protecting, which seems odd considering she did everything but remain with the baby, but no matter.  The project is immediately shut down and head scientist Will Rodman (Franco) takes the cute Gremlin-like chimp home as a pet. Yes, the baby inherited the miracle drug, growing into the highly intelligent Caesar who lives in Rockwell-esque harmony in an attic the size of a high school gymnasium. Rodman also finds time to care for his ailing father (Lithgow) who suffers from - you guessed it - Alzheimer's. He can no longer play the piano, uses a fork backwards and enjoys wearing pajamas throughout the day. Caesar makes Rodman's oddly temperamental neighbors uneasy (especially after attempting to bite off their fingers), so he's put into the already-mentioned medieval dungeon ape pound. Caesar's mistreated with a high-pressure water hose and the Darwinian uprising begins.  I loved the five original \\"Planet of the Apes\\" films ([[ASIN:B0053EZWZQ Planet Of The Apes (1968)]], [[ASIN:B0053EZTWC Beneath The Planet Of The Apes]] [1970], [[ASIN:B0053EZV2U Escape From The Planet Of The Apes]] [1971], [[ASIN:B0053F0BCE Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes]] [1972], [[ASIN:B0053EZT4U Battle For The Planet Of The Apes]] [1973]), one of the many joys of growing up in the 1970s. I also watched the TV series ([[ASIN:B000GUJZ0K Planet of the Apes: The Complete TV Series]] [1974]) and the Saturday morning cartoon ([[ASIN:B000E991A2 Return to the Planet of the Apes - The Complete Animated Series]] [1975]). \\"Rise\\" appears to be a pseudo-remake of \\"Conquest,\\" though quotes verbatim from the original \\"Planet.\\" It's not as good as either film and is even inferior to Tim Burton's muddled 2001 remake [[ASIN:B000SW16NK Planet Of The Apes]]. Remaking the 1970's Ape films is not necessarily a bad thing, and I'll be the first to admit they decreased in quality leading towards the concluding \\"Battle\\" (which I watched with a childhood friend and afterwards, we walked home from the neighborhood theater shuffling like apes). But there was an earnestness and enjoyable sense of humor, not to mention the fine performances of Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter. \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" is a perfect example of modern filmmakers relying almost entirely on computer-generated images as a substitute for wit, imagination and character development. It has the overall stink of a Sci-Fi Channel Movie-of-the-Week and borrows heavily from other superior films.  The most obvious is [[ASIN:B002VPE1B6 Avatar (Two-Disc Original Theatrical Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo)]]. But take a look at the human characters in James Cameron's modern classic, specifically the villain Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang). He has multiple scenes of revelation and a minutes-long discussion when he describes his early missions on the planet. He's most certainly evil, but with fascinating depth carrying the scars of life's misfortune. We understand his Ahab-like rage. Even the scientist Grace (Sigourney Weaver) does not fit any cookie-cutter mold, sucking a cigarette, foul-mouthed and aggressive. \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" has little time for such color or dimension.  When the computer-generated characters are more interesting than the human ones, there's a problem. \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" is one of the worst big-budget films of the year.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Got the package and the item was brand new in the plastic. My daughter loves this movie and we would watch it every year on tv around Christmas time, and finally decided to buy the movie so we could watch it anytime we wanted to. Great movie and you won't be dissapointed. Great actors and graphics.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The weather reports are very accurate.  My husband especially likes the radar and satellite screens.  All in all, a really useful app!
0061478784|5.0|I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my daughter.  I originally had a hard time finding it, I should have gone directly to Amazon.com of couse it was here!  The item was received in excellent condition it was bought new.  I ordered it late but it still arrived before Christmas thank you Amazon!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|fun update of missile command. if atari did a touchscreen version of MC, this is it. it is a throwback game with modern twist.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|The game is challenging for the first few attempts. After that, it lacks variety or increasing complexity. Games can easily last more than 45 minutes. That's a long time to defend the same cityscape against the same weapons. It would be more fun if you had to defend different cityscapes against different weapons.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty good. I like the frog game. some of the games are confiding at first but the get easy when you know what to don
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. some of the games are very hard while others are easy. I love how you gotta keep playing to see what's next.  if you like a good challenge this game is for you.
030746363X|5.0|I sent the book to a family member, who loves it and appreciated the condition.  It arrived before Christmas, as promised.  It took awhile for the reciever to know who sent it though...as that information is unavailable.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|The graphics are great. I really enjoy playing this game. Works very good on LG Optimus. I can not think any changes I would make to this game.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|kinda hard to gain the points to unlock games, and the games do get kinds repetative. however, it does keep you interested and it is a great deal for the price
B005JZBPHS|4.0|My roommate loves this series and she had only watched a few episodes. So I bought it for her and it is all she has been watching. I would say it was a great purchase.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app was so much fun. very addicting! I can not put it down!!! a must get if you like to have hours and hours of fun!
B000B589JI|1.0|I've had this zippo container for a few weeks now.  First I've had it leak its contents out of the container and onto my thigh.  So I then manhandled it to make sure it was securely closed.  Even so, the majority of its contents will evaporate out over time, faster than the zippo lighter itself.  The bottom line is a product that doesn't do what it's supposed to do deserves a one star rating and that's what this product gets.
B00068S41I|5.0|A friend asked for exactly this and I am so glad I was able to find it on VHS as the common format now is DVD or Blue Ray.  It is gratifying to give a gift that someone really wants.  Thank you so much.
B0020EK4QY|4.0|I am not a big fan of Harrison Ford's work but there have been a few films that I have enjoyed with him in it.  Air Force One is very entertaining with a lot of action and suspense.  The special effects are quite good as well with a lot of different and neat tricks to them.  Overall, if you enjoy action/suspense type movies be sure to give it a view.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller
B003XX2PD6|3.0|This album is the first I have heard by Deerhunter. I enjoy the unique use of percussion, occasional driving guitars, the brass, and some of the lyrics on this album. Overall, I'm not sold on the album as a whole, however. Tracks like 'Desire Lines' and 'Helicopter' and 'Coronado' are instantly enjoyable each in its own special way. However, 'Sailing' 'Basement Scene' and 'Earthquake' in my opinion are sleepers and at ~5mins each they drag unnecessarily. Not bad tracks, but not nearly as creative or catchy as the others mentioned.   Don't get me wrong, this is a good album. Is it in the top 10 of 2010? Absolutely not. I don't understand what people are finding incredible about this album/band. It seems anything they do (see Atlas Sound's latest) gets automatic top notch reviews. It is certainly possible I am missing something about this album, which is why I have given it a lot of play to try and decipher what is so phenomenal about it, but to no avail.   Bottom line, this album has some fantastic music on it, but it is not God's gift to indie rock as it has been ordained.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun!! there are tons of different games....harder than i expected though....i need so much practice so i can get more games unlocked.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app does everything it says it does. great app and love the dopler and the temp in status bar
0698116496|5.0|This is a fun book for little kids. My son looked for the balloon on every page, every time we read the book.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Was surprised by how much I liked this.  It's beautiful and it's. really fun toffy and get perfects on every board.  I'm really looking forward to the sequel.
B000ZLFALI|3.0|The plot does take a back seat in this film, despite the filmmakers' attempt to make it seem like it is the main focus. The focus here however is the music. It was a good excuse to make a movie to sing Beatles cover songs, romanticize the sixties, and try and say something about the Vietnam war. Lesbianism is briefly covered as well here. The movie is not terrible, but it also is far from perfection. Also, between the director and the presence of Bono, there is some massive ego going on here. Some of the visuals seemed pointless, but were weird. Not that everything The Beatles did made sense but this is a film, and some parts felt thrown in just for the sake of being strange. I'm glad I saw it, and perhaps I will again someday. But until then, 3 out of five.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|it's addicting for sure!  wouldn't pay for it, but it's great for a free app.  I played it non stop for two hours
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Primarily got this so I could make sure my teenage step son wasn't doing anything he shouldn't on my PC while I was at work.  And the day after I installed it I was rewarded by being able to catch him in the act of actually viewing on my phone what he was doing on my PC while I was at work.  Other than that ability, I also like being able to watch my media I have on my PC on my phone while I'm away.  Just need to have the PC connected to the home network, and the phone will recognize it even if it's connected to a cell network, not just wifi.
0740748475|5.0|I have wanted this collection since they started selling it years ago, but the price was just too high.  But this year between the sale and getting help from family for Christmas, I was able to get it!  I am absolutely loving it!  Thank you Mr. Watterson for making such a wonderful comic series!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|so disappointing, the book was rushed and not thought through well at all, this story had so much potential and it read as if the author had a deadline so she just put words on paper and did not think through the characters and the story line.
0525478817|5.0|As soon as I received this book, I couldn't stop until I had devoured each and every word of it. I nearly went through a box of tissues and yet found myself laughing amidst the tears. John Green has most definitely out done himself with this book. If you enjoy reading good literature, then this is one that you can't afford to miss.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Brings back fond memories of my old Atari, great way to kill half an hour or so. Well worth the dollar spent.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger  Games is the masterful first instalment to The Hunger Games Trilogy.  At first I was reluctant to read this series because I figured, how good can it be?  When I started to read it I thought, wow I was stupid all those months when I mocked The Hunger Games.  The point is, everyone should read this book.  You could be  10 or you could be 50 you would still like this book.  It deals with such fundementaly humman topics, such as love and war, that eveyone who reads this book  finds someting in it for them.  For example, (spoiler alert) Peeta's unconditional love for Katniss, when Rue dies, I could go on forever.  In conclusion, no mater how young or old you are, you will love this book. Suzane Collins puts a new spin on this plot line used in many books.  BUY IT!!!
0312641893|5.0|I have to admit that when I first saw advertisements for Cinder, it didn't inspire me to add it to my `To Read' list. In fact, it wasn't until the release day that I even looked at it on Goodreads. When I read the description, I still wasn't sold, a cyborg Cinderella story set in Beijing sounded strange to me. That and I'm not really into Cinderella retellings. However, as I browsed reviews I started to change to my mind. People were raving about it and then I suddenly started to think, \\"Hmm, a cyborg Cinderella story set in Beijing could actually be interesting and out of the box. Why am I being so narrow minded?\\"<br /><br />Then I saw that it was available on audiobook and my finger started moving closer to the Purchase button. Ever since I've signed up for the YA Audiobook Challenge, I've been eager to start marking off books.  That settled it. Cinder went from no where near my To Read listen to my Currently Reading list in 2.5 seconds.  And let me tell you, I was pleasantly surprised and so happy that I pushed aside my hesitation to read/listen to a cyborg Cinderella story.<br /><br />Set in a dystopian future in what is now called New Beijing, Cinder stars a teenage cyborg girl who has it very much like Cinderella. Cinder lives with her stepmother and step sisters who pretty much loathe her and blame her for everything, with the exception of her stepsister and friend Peony. She is a skilled mechanic and her talents are put to use by running an electronics repair shop and fixing whatever her stepmother wants fixed. The stepmother and stepsisters only focus is preparing themselves for the ball held by the handsome young Prince Kai of New Beijing.<br /><br />There are occasional direct Cinderella references such as an old car that resembles a pumpkin, a cyborg foot that takes the place of a glass slipper, and a cute android that replaces friendly rodents that sing and dance and help Cinderella get ready for the ball. But the originality of these references is sweet and they bring a smile to your lips when you come across them. However, if you are hoping for a fairy godmother, you won't find one in this version. And things don't end fairytale perfect like they do for Cinderella.<br /><br />The story line probably sounds pretty familiar to you and much of the plot keeps to the original story.  Despite the similarities, there are many things that set this book apart from the original. The cyborg aspect, for one, adds a whole new dimension to Cinder's character. At a young age, she was in a horrible accident leaving a majority of her body in disrepair. To keep her alive, Cinder was turned in a Cyborg. Although cyberization saved her live, she has new problems to face. Cyborgs are considered less than human and are often shunned by others. To maintain her body she must buy expensive parts, which upsets her stepmother.<br /><br />In spite of being a cyborg, Cinder is a relatable heroine. She is kind, smart, unselfish, brave, yet makes typical teenage mistakes that only further diminish her not so wonderful life situation. You will find yourself rooting for her from beginning to end.<br /><br />There is a cute semi-romantic relationship between Cinder and Prince Kai and one of the things I appreciated about their relationship is that it has time to develop. Kai's character is very likeable. He is a noble Prince who has been forced to grow up fast but he takes his role in stride and is dedicated to helping his people.  He has the weight of the world on his shoulders as he searches for the cure to a world wide plague, tries to alleviate tension between Earth and the Lunar.<br /><br />I am eagerly awaiting the next book in the series. When this book was over, I literally cried out in frustration. I was not ready for it to be over and I wanted it to keep going. That's a sign of a good book. Meyer sets up the end nicely for the next book and I can't wait to find out with Cinder will do.  I highly recommend this book to people of all ages. It's a great read/listen.

B0000AUHPG|1.0|The other reviewers point out that this movie is so slow and boring that it is worse than watching paint dry.  I have to agree.  There is almost no dialogue in this film, especially the opening scenes.  It moves so slowly, it is painful to watch.  Maybe a few people think this kind of artsy kitsch is appealing, but not  me.  When a director like Sergio Leone wants me to watch a 10-year-old boy get blown away by Henry Fonda in one of his \\"badass\\" roles, I'm already disinterested.  It reminds me too much of the plot for \\"Gangs of New York\\" which, by the way, had no plot whatsoever, hence it was a film not bothering with.  Gratuitous violence in the beginning and then more gratuitous violence later on in the picture.  If this picture were the LEAST bit engaging or interesting, I might give it 2 stars.  It does not engage or draw in the viewer.  The endless scenes are just that -- painfully endless.  They painfully and gruelingly continue long after the viewer has lost all interest.  I'm sure many viewers love painfully long and pointless scenes. But, for me, there are SO MANY better Westerns out there, who wants to get stuck in the mire watching this plodding excuse for a story?  I would recommend Anthony Mann's \\"The Furies\\" or \\"Garden of Evil\\" for anyone who wants a serious Western but with characters you can actually care about.  Or, \\"My Darling Clementine\\" for those Henry Fonda lovers.  Even \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\" is a better movie than this tripe, despite Liberty's dark and depressing story.  If you are into dull Westerns, Once Upon A Time In The West is definitely your type of movie.
B002LVUKIS|5.0|When I first saw my friend play this game, my first was impulse was not \\"Holy crap, I gotta go buy this,\\" it was more like \\"Wow, they actually want you to be smart, s***...\\". When I did get around to playing it myself I enjoyed it so much that I clean forgot about Battlefront and Fable (new games at the time) because I understood the freedom you have, not free-roam mind you, but with how you want to go about infiltrating areas, what equipment you use, how you use it, and often how you're going to get back out.<br />There is a wide enough array of equipment to keep you busy. What I remember most, however, is how when you went to certain places you'd feel like you weren't the only person sneaking around. That's what really got me---the idea that while I was fixing to steal something, something else was coming up on me. It's all the atmosphere of the game, mind you---but atmosphere makes a big difference. If you do it right you can tell, and I believe this wholly, that Assassin's Creed took a big chunk out of this game. Obviously, my favourite installment was Deadly Shadows, but each of these games are excellent and unique.
1451627289|4.0|I really enjoyed Mr. King's newest novel.  I haven't read his books since his early novels.  But I thoroughly loved the time travel back to one of my passions in life - the JFK assisination.  Having been in 9th grade when that happened it's always been my \\"911\\"; I've read many many books on this particular subject; and though I do not agree with the lone killer being Oswald, like King does, I still found myself spellbound at times and it was one of those 'can't put down' books for me.  I love the love story that's wrapped inside this piece and was disappointed that it didn't turn out better in the end. Certainly made me think about not changing what has already happened; and like they say \\"everything happens for a reason\\".  All in all it's one of the best books I've read in a very long time... can't wait for the movie!  Thanks, Steven King, you're a genius!
B002EWD0I6|5.0|I am absolutely delighted with this wonderful series and would highly recommend it for the viewing pleasure of anyone interested in great cinematography, authenticity, depth of charecters, richness of life learning and lessons, the possibility of true love within humankind expressed through television. The best-next to Anne Of Green Gables- I have had the pleasure of watching! Thank you's go out to all involved in the making of this series.
1846555248|5.0|I'll admit that I was only attracted to this book by its beautifully designed cover, and I was pleasantly surprised that the story was actually pretty good. I agree with most that the description was simply magical, but it's not exactly a book I would like to read again just because I couldn't really connect with the characters. The book was interesting, but the characters sometimes seemed like objects made to fulfill their part in the story instead of actual people. Overall, the story was enjoyable and I found that I simply couldn't put down the book until I finally reached the end.  ------------------  Edit: I first put 4 stars, but I changed it to 5 stars.  Although I didn't like it that much because the story didn't focus on the two main characters, I realized that this story is truly about the Circus and its legend that will hopefully continue with the younger generation. This story about an enchanting circus is wonderful.
B000085RTZ|5.0|It's as though Kamelot is getting nothing but better. Though I just picked up this album recently, the ten years it has aged has hardly made it weak. Their symphony augmented power metal is exactly that, a fantastical journey for the ears. The album itself is the first half of a two album story based heavily on the play Dr Faustus, by Chris Marlow, adapted by Van Goethe into a novel. The album is definitely not a weak member of the trio.
0547258305|5.0|I have read many books, but this is the only book that really had a lasting impression on me! I love the characters, and I love how well developed they are!   I love how the two main characters balance each other out nicely.  I admit that I expected more out of Katsa's and Po's relationship, but since they both are still pretty young, I can see why things ended the way they did.   This story was beautiful, and I was surprised to find out that it was the first book that this author has published!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game to keep everyone happy. kids love the different games you can unlock.  points are not hard to get.
B0051CSIKQ|5.0|this movie is a good movie to see lots of blood and gore  not a bad story reminds me of the movie the road in away thats just my thought of this movie the people were great in the movie too.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|Just downloaded this app on my kindle fire. First had to install software on my Pc and created a gmail account because that seemed to be the easiest way to get up and running. Well it was.a snap. Software loaded without a glitch and when finished asked if I had a gmail account or wanted to create one, which I did in a mater of a couple of minutes. The went to the app store on the kindle fire and purchased the Splashtop Remote App. Started the app and was amazed. This app works great. If you want remote access to any computer you own and all its programs and files this is for you. I have read about concerns of it not being encrypted. It is password protected and I feel if you are careful not to use it where free WiFi may pose a problem, which would only be somewhere where someone with the know how and ability not to mention the desire to snoop on your activity would be, you wont have any problems by it not being encrpyted. Using the interface takes a little getting use to since the kindle fire has no mouse, but you will easally get used to it within a few minutes of use. One note is that it did change the resulution on my Pc while I was using the app (used it in front of the Pc to see how.it worked) ,but that was only while using the app. As soon as I shut down app the Pc appearance went back to how I had it sent up.  You do need to remember that you are controlling your Pc so any changes you make with the app will stay that way ( moving desktop icons, creating folders, deleting items).  If you don't want to spend 20 or 30 dollars on other apps like this that do have encryption, but also suffer from much slower performance then this is the app for you. I only use this on my kindle fire with WiFi  Can only speculate that if you used this app on an Andriod phone the size of the screen may tend to be a problem or frustrating  And would bet if used in 3g or 4g might tend to burn some significant data usage.  But these last two comments are only speculation on my part andI would love to see other reviews on these topics. Try it today I think you will be pleasently surprised!
B005XQLBU4|3.0|got the clap until i was 30. thought i had protection until a big one blew me. i never seemed to make enough to get fixed all the way; is what led to my death. i don't see why some people pay for this kind of thing? you could just as easy swat flies. the clouds in the background were cool for some reason?
0792838068|5.0|I have never before seen such a bad quality print as this is. I could not even watch the entire movie because the sound and the picture just insulted me and this great masterpiece of a movie. The sound quality and picture transfer is horrible. How could they put out such a rippoff? DON'T GET SCREWED LIKE ME JUST GET THE BLURAY! BY THE WAY- THE MOVIE ITSELF IS WONDERFUL! CAGE'S PERFORMANCE IS A TOUR DE FORCE AND SHUE IS GREAT AS WELL. MIKE FIGGIS HAS REALLY MADE A GREAT DEEP HEARTFELT FILM HERE, ONE THAT DEMANDS EXTRA VIEWINGS.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|I'm not new to using remote tools to access my computer.  I installed the splashtop desktop client and made my security code and whatnot.  I entered my dynamicDNS (which works with Pocketcloud) and it wouldn't connect.  For some reason the port it uses is 6783 and I opened it on my router and it still didn't work.  POS
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I'm glad I got this cover it protects my Kindle Fire from getting banged up as I carry it around in my purse and set it down wherever.  I like the way it helps stand the Fire up so I can read or watch hands free but it can be a little unstable.  I wish the stand snapped into the back somehow so that it wouldn't slip periodically.  Not a huge problem but I have to be aware of it.
B004LROMSO|5.0|This is a smartly produced series with good characterization and plotting.  This is no Disney special, but a vivid and explicit account.  There is magic and fun, swords and blood.  Plot and counterplot abound. Conspiracies and alliances everywhere.  This series grabs you and sends you on a real ride.
0307887898|5.0|Ries makes a compelling, interesting case for how to innovate in both small and large companies alike.  This approach is akin to the agile movement in software development.  The strategies suggested here show entrepreneurs how to create products that customers want with minimal waste and investment in unsuccessful ventures.  I found the description of how Intuit created a \\"lean startup\\" within its large organization especially interesting.  Many companies let their size stifle innovation, but Ries clearly outlines how to overcome this and develop prototypical products quickly and efficiently.  Definitely not the only approach to startups, but Ries has the industry credentials to make his advice worth listening to.
B0025UHKNS|2.0|I have been really into running over the past year or so, and was using an old Nike Triax C8 to simply attend to my heart rate.  It took me awhile to realize that I probably needed something a little more sophisticated, and when I found the Forerunner 405CX at a steal at a local warehouse store, I took the plunge.  Lets just say, it was a tiny bit under three digits in dollar amount.<br /><br />I used this watch religiously for 3 months, watching my times improve, seeing how many calories I'd burned, my average heart rate, my pace per mile, how many miles I was running each month.  It was fantastic.  It picked up the satellites quickly, and I experienced absolutely no problems with software and transfers to my 13\\" Macbook Pro.<br /><br />I can honestly say, I loved this watch.  Until...<br /><br />This weekend, I ran a local 1/2 marathon.  At about 8.75 miles, the watch died.  It shut itself off, continually restarted and then I would get one grey line across the screen.  It was completely non-responsive to any user interface interaction.  I gave up and decided, I'll just look at my time when I get my chip time. (Though it certainly would have been nice to have pace information).  A bit later I look down and it has started again.  So, I press start.  And, we're back in business.  I near the finish line, and it's on, but not recording.  It had turned itself off, i.e., pressed stop of its own accord.<br /><br />It was purchased exactly 3 months to the day prior to this happening.  I get home and research the problem on the internet.  I am clearly not the only one having this issue.  When I plug it in, it says, \\"Charging 0%.\\"  It always says this when plugged in now.  There is clearly a problem with the meter for the battery, as it began saying low battery 0% during the half marathon 8 hours ago and was never recharged, nor did it die.  I try a reset, erasing all user data and starting from scratch.  No help.<br /><br />Back to the warehouse store it goes.  Thank you for the healthy return policy.  I certainly could have returned it to Garmin for a refurb since it is less than a year old, but I prefer not to play Russian roulette with my races.  All I can say is, that after researching software and hardware issues, the only Garmin that appears to be a fair bet is the 305 (which they just introduced a replacement to).  I'm snatching one up before they're gone. There are other options out there, but honestly, the only other one I'd consider is the Timex Ironman Run Trainer.  Apparently their software is not so good.  So, the lesser of two evils it is!<br /><br />Buyer beware.<br /><br />Honestly, it was lovely when it worked, really fantastic.  Yes, the bezel was not highly responsive, but all in all, it did a good job.  However, when you purchase this type of item, you certainly expect it to work for more than 90 days.ave returned it to Garmin for a refurb since it is less than a year old, but I prefer not to play Russian roulette with my races.

0545403359|5.0|It's one thing to see a movie, but you'll enjoy it even more if you've read the book first. Promise! You'll also want to read this author's other novels as well.
B003KK6GOQ|3.0|There is something quaint, cosy and old fashioned about this story....it made me feel this would be something my grandmother would enjoy reading. The story is filled with dear charactors that in the end endear you to the book. At the beginning I must confess that I thought the book rather ho-hum, finding it tedious to follow the letter format but by the end I could not put it down until I knew whether or not Juliet and Dawsey would finally get together.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love playing the games but they cost a lot to unlock. great way to waste some time and the kids love it
B005HSL626|5.0|Like I said in my review title, IT'S AWESOME! What you do in this game (if you've never heard of this game which is very weird because almost everyone knows about it) is that you slice fruit and to get combos you slice many fruit in one line.  If you like slicing fruit with out all the touching the blade rubbish. All you have you have to do is swipe your finger across the fruit.  HAVE FUN! DOWNLOAD THIS NOW!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. The games are very fun! The games are full of creativity. my fave. game is aquarium.
0143119680|4.0|It took me a little bit to really get into the book, however once I did I could not put the book down! I love the quotes.  The only reason I gave it a 4 stars I was a little disappointed of the ended only because I wanted to read more.  Maybe hoping for a continuation after Diana learns how to use her magic!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I started playing it at my cousin's house and I downloaded it to my kindle. It was fun in some games. I like the sushi roll game.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Got to me well before it needed to, perfect condition and a great product as well! My husband was very pleased when he opened it under the tree:)
B005D0RDKW|4.0|I didn't buy this when it came out. Normally on release day, I'm chomping at the bit but this time I was a little put off by the whole \\"how many times do I have to pay for Moving Pictures?\\" As more time went on, I kept reading reviews and youtube posts about how Geddy can't sing anymore and that the show was terrible. After watching, I have to disagree. I bought this because I wanted to support the band, and since no one buys the new albums anymore, this is the way they're staying in the game. I'm also a fan of Rush's sense of humor so their little skits are always worth the 17 bucks to me. I'm really happy I bought this. I watched the whole thing in one sitting and never did I get bored or think \\"dear god not this song again\\" I was smiling ear to ear as the boys got to jam out on parts and their usual stage antics. I thought the first set was great, and well put together. You can tell Rush has some heavy enthusiasm for the new material as BU2B was upbeat, and aggressive. Neil was playing on top of the beat and a little faster than the recorded version. Marathon was a little too fast, and to me seemed to have lost it's groove, but some impressive open handed playing by Neil in the second verse. The second set is what it is. Moving Pictures and some gems. I was disappointed to hear the new arrangement for The Camera Eye. Killer version of Witch Hunt, Alex just owns that song. Great rendition of Caravan. I'm giving this 4 stars because the audio could have been a hell of alot better. The use of surround is subtle at best and the biggest use was hearing the audience behind me. That's pretty weak. It's also compressed a bit too much. Geddy's bass can be a bit tame at times. To all the critics out there who say Geddy can't hit the high notes anymore, or even worse, can't sing anymore, I have this to say. Geddy Lee sounds amazing on the newer songs, and songs with mid to lower registers. He also nailed the high notes in freewill and alot of other songs. Faithless was flawless. The guy can sing and his voice has matured very nicely over the years. That being said, He doesn't sound like he did 30 years ago. No one over the age of 50 sounds like they did when they were 30. If you want to hear that, then please go put on the original recording or Exit Stage Left and stop complaining about the impossible. The guy is on tour for 6 to 8 months out of the year, has to sing challenging songs for 3 hours, so he has to pick his battles. I can't even say he blew the notes, he just sings it different with a \\"live feel\\" The songs that suffered the most were songs I've heard a thousand times anyway. You go to a Rush show, or buy their concert DVD because you want to watch these guys entertain you, not to hear the album versions. This concert rocked my socks off when I expected it not to. They have fun, can play their asses off, great versions of the tunes, and show love for their fans. A great experience live or on disc.

B005LAIGFU|4.0|This is a disturbing story of a mother coping with her psychotic son.  From birth, this child was different.  He cried and screamed all the time.  He was mean to everyone and as he grew, his cruelty expanded.  His mother, brilliantly played by Tilda Swinton, does her best to cope.  But she meets one disappointing challenge after another and as the child grows up, he gets worse and worse, demonstrating the epitome of cruelty to all around him, including his little sister.  The father, played by John C. Reilly, refuses to accept his son's dysfunction and even buys him a real bow and arrows.  Ezra Miller plays the role of the son as an adolescent and his performance is nothing less than outstanding and horrifically scary.<br /><br />The story is told in flashback through the eyes of the mother, and Tilda Swinton's eyes portray all her horror and sorrow as she tries to cope with it all.  She gives an outstanding performance and the sorrow she lives with is like a live and living thing which flows though the film and keeps it melancholy and sad.  From the beginning the audience understands that the child is damaged and that only horror can come from him.<br /><br />The film is created as an art form.  Much of it is understated and details are never explicit.  This makes it even more upsetting and I left the theater with a feeling of absolute revulsion.  For that reason I stop short of recommending it.  Despite its artistic value, life is too short to let ourselves be so depressed by a film.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games are fun, but some are frustrating when the controls stick. Overall, it is a good game for the free price.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Better than the original Missle Command.  Very smooth gameplay, and gradual increasing difficulty is done very well.  Like the ability to earn defense upgrades and repair damage.  Plays great on Kindle Fire.
0545265355|5.0|I've read a lot of books in my time, and the last set that really got me going was Harry Potter.  After that I really didn't find anything to peak my interest.  A friend from work recommended this series and since I plan on seeing the movie, I figured I should give the books a shot.  To my surprise I can't put the first book down and literally have to force myself to stop reading.  I keep thinking \\"one more chapter\\", but it always turns into 3 or 4.  Anyways... If you plan on seeing the movie, and even if your not, you HAVE to read this.  It is such an easy read, but it is full of imagination and excitement.  You won't be disappointed!  I am a little more than half way through, but this book is just so awesome I had to right a review now.  Happy reading! :-)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is sooo fun!!!  beware: very very addicting! never glitches or has problems! hard to get all the games but you'll be playing for hours
B0052U59F4|2.0|I've finally read this book to see what all the fuss is about. 50 Shades of Grey always seems to be the #1 selling book/e-book. And I have to say I wasn't impressed. I was expecting a lot out of this story ESPECIALLY because of all the hype around it.<br /><br />The concept of the story is interesting (I am wondering if is original and if EL James came up with it. If someone has seen a similar concept before EL James wrote this story please share!). However, the author failed to keep it interesting. In fact, it very quickly became boring and repetitive.<br /><br />I like the idea of how a billionaire (Christian Grey) falls for the innocent virgin who is not super hot (Anastasia). However, the character of Christian Grey is not believable. The amount of wealth he acquired and the manner in which he acquired it is simply not believable. It is way too far-fetched. He is way too PERFECT.<br /><br />I like how initially there was a build up in sexual tension between the main characters Christian Grey and Anastasia. But once the two got together (which is 1/3 through the book) the story turned BORING and REPETITIVE. Even the erotica scenes were not that exciting and repetitive. I did like the e-mail exchanges though between Christian Grey and Anastasia. There was some witty banter going on.<br /><br />I was hoping there was more depth to the story. For example, if the secondary characters could have been involved more such as Jose and Paul. I would have liked to have seen Anatasia get closer to them and make Christian very jealous. More about Christian's past should have been revealed and his relationship with Miss Robinson.<br /><br />I don't like how the story ends. In fact it was a LOUSY ending. I appreciate EL James wanted to leave something for Part II but what she did make sure is that I won't be buying Part II.<br /><br />To summarize, the plot did not keep you on the edge (only some interesting elements in the first 1/3 of the book). The story was shallow. The characters were not believable especially Christian Grey. The erotica scenes were not great.<br /><br />I have no idea how this book became such a huge it!

B0009XNUK0|5.0|I was a little young when the Jackson 5 were doing their thing and out of college by the time Thriller came out.  Consequently, my music collection is pretty lacking in the MJ department, as my 12-year-old pointedly noted.  I got this collection for her for Christmas and she loves it.  Starts with little Michael singing his early classics with his brothers and spans the rest of his career over the course of 2 discs.  True fans will undoubtedly want to buy individual releases, but for those of us who are looking for the greatest hits, this is a nice collection at a good price.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Great tool for a very busy college student, and very helpful for quick notes. Even better when you can share and edit across multiple devices.
B002JVWR4U|4.0|was not quite what I expected, though it had the action I was expecting, the story lines were not as good as I had hoped. but not a total loss either for it is entertaining, and there is enough humor to cary the wierd plotlines through with out seeming silly. Over all I will have to say not bad just not quite as good as I had hoped for.  The talent of the actors made this show as good as it is.
B003L77G06|5.0|Thank you very much for your prompt delivery. It arrived on time and in great shape. I will more than likely order from you again. :)

B005XQLBU4|5.0|others have said this is the way missile command was meant to be played. I got this during the free period and was glad it was free.
B005K17RU0|5.0|always works even in different locations. I use it on my Kindle Fire and my Android phone. I love it!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Played it once and need to stop. I need to go to bed. If I don't do it now I'll be up for hours. It's addictive.
1594744769|5.0|I just received this book through my amazon wishlist, and I read it right away. It's a quick read, but that might be because it's so interesting that you can't help but love it! It leaves you wanting to read more, and wishing the story wouldn't end. That said, I hope this means there's a sequel out there for us!
B005ZHBA9I|5.0|I have purschased every Score and Soundtrack for each of the Twilight movies, New Moon Score is still the best and my favorite but this one was well worth the wait. The price was fair, I preordered and it was delivered in great condition as promised. I will be getting the soundtrack and will wait for part two to come out. Thanks.
B00498XP1K|5.0|For zombie fans this absolutely ranks right there with the best of the genre.  You may have some arguments as to why something else is better, but you cannot deny that this is a great one.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This.is a.great app.  It is easy to use, fun to play and a great way to spend a little time.
B00006I53S|5.0|I love this lens. It has a great range and takes excellent pictures. I can't say much more about the lens, I am very happy with it.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I received my case in a very timely manner, even during the Christmas holidays!  It's is very well made and fits my Kindle perfectly.  I had read that some who ordered it complained that the cover wouldn't close, but mine closed with no problem.  It is very stylish and the perfect way to protect my Kindle.
0684135051|5.0|Whether you're just learning to knit, or have been stitching away for quite some time, this book is GREAT! It's like having a wise and encouraging teacher sitting right there with tips, techniques and encouraging words.  In a day when \\"political correctness\\" seems to characterize conversations in all realms of life, it's refreshing to read the essays of a woman who is passionate, opinionated, and not ashamed to be so. One is not required to agree with all the opinions expressed, but even in disagreement, there is humor and encouragement. For example, I don't share Mrs. Zimmerman's \\"horror\\" of purling.... and yet, I enjoy her musings about ways to avoid \\"the dreaded purl\\".<br />The garment and accessory designs presented are for classic items, in style for every era, with common sense tips on fitting and specific techniques for knitting them. The technique descriptions and drawings are pretty clear and easy to follow, if one has yarn and needles in hand.<br />Weaknesses of the book are that all photos are black and white, and the standard paperback or hardback binding tends to flop shut while in use.  I wish it were available spiral bound to lay flat when open.<br />Most of all, this book is worth its price because of the basic message: you are not a slave to published designs/patterns-- you are the \\"boss of your knitting.\\" For that repeated encouragement (and its practical applications) alone, this book is well worth its price.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Not only can you read the Bible in just about any English translation, you can also listen to it as you read.  This kept my attention longer and kept me more focused.  Easy to get started too.
0307957934|5.0|This is my first introduction to Robert Harris and I can say I look forward to reading many more books from him. This has been a page turner for me since I picked it up. Dr. Alexander Hoffmann  is in his study in Geneva admiring his first edition of \\"The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals \\"by no other- Charles Darwin.  He has a number of first editions and collects books of this nature that can been found in his study.His wife is use to him staying up late with his books and retires upstairs without a thought.<br /> After he finally goes to sleep he is woken by a sound in the middle of the night- they have advance security system so he thinks very little of the sound until he can't sleep. He must rise and investigate downstairs without waking his wife.<br /> After checking the rooms he goes out the front door and takes a look around. There he see into his own kitchen window a man in his house! From there the story snow balls into one of great suspense and mystery.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|got it free worth paying for.  very addictive game nice controls. great graphics and sound... top quality game  give it a try you wont be disappointed
B000RIWAYY|5.0|I bought this disc for the DVD and it did not disappoint. Watch the concert and then read the liner notes - you will be blown away. I got to see the same band tour in support of \\"Flying in a Blue Dream\\" two years after this performance was filmed and it was incredible. Stu Hamm is in the same league as Joe on his instrument. I haven't listened to the remastered CD yet, but for me it is just a bonus. If you're a \\"Satch\\" fan, grab this package b/f it's gone!
0525478817|5.0|I was not aware that this book was for young adults when I purchased it. As I began reading it, it became clear that it was targeted to young adults although I still found the characters intriguing.  I have two grown children of my own, so I found this book difficult to read a times.  I would have to put it down and give myself some time before going back to it.  It's not that I didn't want to read it but it was emotionally overwhelming.  Reading about young adults struggling with facing their imminent death is not easy to read about. However, their thoughts reflect what all of us have in facing our own mortality.  Kids are just so open and frank with what their feelings are and express them candidly.  The extreme fascination that Hazel Grace has  with the book she is obsessed with seemed like a metaphor for so many questions that she felt about herself.  Would she just end with nothing else - just empty pages?  Who doesn't want their lives to matter beyond their time here.These kids had less time to make their stamp in the world but still so wanted to know their short existence mattered and made a difference.  I almost felt like the author of Hazel's book was a metaphor for God, who didn't ultimately seem to care how important the answers were for Grace. Did that mean that God doesn't care about the pain that is inflicted on these kids but just inflicts without compassion? This is a thoughtful, sad book but we still somehow route for these kids and know that they do matter and we end up loving them ourselves.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like it so far! It is a nice challenge and a good way to kill time. Plus, it's free.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is so great! I love using the reading plans, I am about 160 days into the year long chronological plan.
0374275637|4.0|As one who was brought up with Herbert Simon and\\"satisficing,\\" I have mixed feelings about this book.  As an intelligence professional I know for a fact that corrupt politicians have zero interest in the facts, only in what will profit them personally in the short-term.  As much as I would like to see integrity restored as the core value of government, economy, and society, in the larger context in which we live this book is a curiosity.<br /><br />There are gems and it is certainly worth reading, but as one other reviewer points out, it is not the easiest reading nor the most delightful.  Here is what I got out of it (my summary notes, I donate all books right after I read them, to a nearby university).<br /><br />For those instances when BOTH intelligence (decision-support) officers and their clients (politicians, policy makers, acquisition managers, operational commanders) have integrity--a condition that does not exist today, this book is very useful as a training aid.<br /><br />01  It strives to provide a deeper understanding of judgments and choices by humans.<br /><br />02  It fully documents the biases of intuition (judgment informed by past cases)<br /><br />03  It documents the fact that decision making under uncertainty leads to humans being too prone to believe findings based on inadequate evidence, and too prone to avoid collecting a sufficiency of observations or research findings by others.<br /><br />The essence of the book is the author's distinction between System 1 and System 2.<br /><br />System 1 is automatic, fact, and falls prey to illusions.<br /><br />System 2 is controlled, slow, requires attention, and is easily distracted.<br /><br />Conclusions about judgment heuristics (rules of thumb):<br /><br />HARD to think statistically<br /><br />EASY to think associatively<br /><br />We have EXCESS CONFIDENCE in what we think we know, and a deep, deep, deep inability to acknowledge our ignorance.<br /><br />Humans DEVIATE from rational model with two major CORRUPTIONS:<br /><br />01  Treat problems in isolation instead of as part of a systemic whole<br /><br />02  Treat problems in relation to framing effects that distort perceptions with inconsequential trivia<br /><br />QUOTE (34):  We found that people, when engaged in a mental sprint, may become effectively blind.\\"<br /><br />That one sentence made the book worthwhile to me.  I have long been a fan of Red Cells and walk-abouts and other forms of being forced to engage outside the box, this one sentence reminded me of my now firm view that all analytic teams need an independent Yoda to challenge them.<br /><br />The author surprises me with a substantive discourse on how money has caused people to collaborate less--it makes them more independent of one another and displaces the social value of collaboration.<br /><br />I am fascinated by the author's focus on surprise as a litmus test for the extent to which we are open.<br /><br />He emphasizes that hypotheses should be confirmed by trying to REFUTE the hypothesis rather than by searching for additional supporting evidence.  Having the hypothesis is enough.  If it cannot be refutes, THAT is worth much more than a documented but not seriously challenged hypothesis.<br /><br />QUOTE (117):  The tendency to see patterns in randomness is overwhelming.<br /><br />This in the context of the anchoring effect, and the stark strong impact of preconceived notions that shape perception of inclusive into conclusive, contradictory into confirming.<br /><br />The discussion of risk, for an intelligence professional, is very very interesting.  The author focuses on how critical it is to actually have a measure of risk--to know with some precision what you are defining as risk, why.<br /><br />I am blown away by a discussion that makes it clear that praise or punishment are generally irrelevant for professionals.  They tend to do the best they can, and the odds are such that praise or punishment have no effect but appear to have effect because they zig zag along a mean.  \\"It is what it is.\\"  I connect this with the National Football League, and how calm most team players are when they miss a catch or a block.  \\"It is what it is.\\"<br /><br />I'm not sure this is the book I would want for advanced intelligence courses, but I really like chapter 19 on the illusion of understanding and chapter 20 on the illusion of validity.  Even if our political officials are corrupt, we intelligence professionals should at least strive to get it right.<br /><br />The author is a believer in algorithms over experts.  I have mixed feelings about that.  Certainly I agree that most experts are wrong and much narrower in their understanding than common competence requires, but I am also very skeptical of algorithms, witness Google's math hacks against digital garbage.  As a believer in collective human intelligence (citizen wisdom councils, etcetera), I accept the importance of taking algorithms as far as they can go, but algorithms are no better than the humans who constructed them and the data known to the humans at that time.<br /><br />I give the author great credit for providing a superb overview across the book of stars in this field.  This is not a selfish or self-centered book--it appears to do full justice to all others.<br /><br />Great thoughts in this book:<br /><br />01  Capitalists--both inventors and entrepreneurs--overestimate their success rate by two times.<br /><br />02  Illusion of control is increased by a failure to seek out data from others [this is one reason I champion M4IS2--Multinational, Multiagency, Multidisciplinary, Multidomain Information-Sharing and Sense-Making) and public intelligence in the public interest).<br /><br />QUOTE (262):  Organizations that take the word of overconfident experts can expect costly consequences.<br /><br />NEW TO ME:  Psycho-physics--relation of mind and matter.  This may be a different way of talking about quantum physics, but it is one more indication that mind-matter interfaces are going to be a huge area of study in the future.<br /><br />The  author confirms Machiavelli 101--defenders of the status quo are always stronger than reformers seeking change [he does not say this but Kuhn and others do: UNTIL the status quo self-destructs from its own corruption, and the reformers are free to build on its ashes].<br /><br />On page 411 he provides a very serious critique of libertarianism, pointing out that libertarians assume all individuals are rational and see no value in aggregate services.<br /><br />QUOTE (417):  Observers are less cognitively bvusy and more open to information than actors.<br /><br />The more I think about this, the more I think that we need a new class of intelligence professionals who are neither collectors nor analysts, but observers \\"in situ\\" with decision-makers or \\"in situ\\" with crisis situations, and they provide the \\"third eye\\".  I am writing the chapter on \\"The Craft of Intelligence\\" for the next Routledge Handbook of Intelligence Studies, and this is one new idea that I credit to this book and author, that I plan to integrate into my thinking about the future of intelligence as a discipline.<br /><br />There are two appendices and an excellent index.<br /><br />As is my custom, I always use Amazon's link feature to point to other related books.  Here are ten in the decision-making arena that I consider especially valuable.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000PWL60G Radical Man: The Process of Psycho-Social Development]]<br />[[ASIN:0525484345 The Knowledge Executive]]<br />[[ASIN:0262681153 Tools for Thought: The History and Future of Mind-Expanding Technology]]<br />[[ASIN:0029227917 Thinking in Time: The Uses of History for Decision-Makers]]<br />[[ASIN:0415779324 Planning with Complexity: An Introduction to Collaborative Rationality for Public Policy]]<br />[[ASIN:1601630301 Business War Games: How Large, Small, and New Companies Can Vastly Improve Their Strategies and Outmaneuverthe Competition]]<br />[[ASIN:0230103944 Reflexive Practice: Professional Thinking for a Turbulent World]]<br />[[ASIN:1442966424 Open Space Technology: A User's Guide]]<br />[[ASIN:0262014459 Atlas of Science: Visualizing What We Know]]<br />[[ASIN:0226116166 Holistic Darwinism: Synergy, Cybernetics, and the Bioeconomics of Evolution]]d the reformers are free to build on its ashes].

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so fun. I totally regimens it for people. _I play it all the time so does my little siblings. my mom sometimes plays it. but lime I said its so much fun
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game. Pretty much just like the original but with some cute extra features. Easy to play but gets pretty hard as it goes on.
159420229X|5.0|Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything by Joshua Foer is a 2011 non-fiction book that will change how you think about your memory.  If you like Malcolm Gladwell or books that help you see the world a bit differently, I'd add this to your reading list.<br /><br />Foer, a young reporter, went to report on the ultimate event -- the U.S. Memory Championships.  He met the competitors, learned about their talents and decided to participate in the following year's competition.  He learned the skills, trained and ended up winning the competition.  Through Foer's adventure, he teaches the reader that memory is like most other skills, one which we can be learned.  He explains some of the basic and intricate techniques he was taught.  It is amazing.  By creating absurd images of objects and placing them in a memory palace (a place you know very well, such as a childhood home), with proper training, you can store extensive material.  For example, look at this list:<br /><br />-pickled garlic<br />-cottage cheese<br />-smoked salmon<br />-six bottles of white wine<br />-3 pairs of dirty socks<br />-3 hula hoops<br />-a snorkel<br />-a dry ice machine<br />-write an email to Sophia<br /><br />Last Thursday, I memorized the list above based on the techniques in the book and I still remember it crisply.  It is amazing!  I've tried this out on four subjects so far and each one has had equal success.<br /><br />The book reads as if it is a long New Yorker article: well written, highly entertaining and beautifully executed. It was a great book.  Foer writes like a journalist, meaning that the material is accessible.  Highly recommended.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|I am so glad I decided to read the book before seeing the movie! Wow....I devoured this novel in one huge long greedy meal for the first time in many years.  The writing was wonderful and I cared about Eva having experienced many of the same feelings and thoughts about motherhood and the social implications - nature vs nurture and the current state of the United States...A must read for someone interested into how our society has degenerated into the state it has...
0061537969|5.0|Not my style of book (I usually read Historical Fiction) but after much harassing from a co-worker I purchased this book and to my surprise LOVED every single page. Could not put it down.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really good you don't have to by coins and there's 100 games good time killer and has some apps that cost money like air hockey it totally free to I love it!!
B006JN5KBG|5.0|Fright Night is one of the best vampire flicks of all time - great cast and crew, good soundtrack and one memorable performance from the late, great Roddy McDowall! Chris Sarandon's portrayal of a vampire that enjoys himself (and munching on some great looking women) is not to be missed. The only thing that makes this great movie even better is the fact that it has been released on blu-ray!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Even before I figured out how to make the keyboard work, I loved it for giving me the ability to play all the podcasts on my computer without having to move them to the cloud. Love being able to access Thunderbird for my mail so as not to lose track of who I've answered as that often happened. Terrific ap once you get the hang of it. : )  Linda  Www.thebodycodetohealth.com
B0052U59F4|5.0|Wow!  I finished this book so quickly, I had no idea I could read so quickly or could ignore everything else so well.  I reread it 2 days later, after reading the 2nd book.  I cannot wait for the 3rd.  It drew me in so quickly that I was breathing heavily before any of the \\"good stuff\\" even happened!  Very well written- EL Smith writes characters that I actually start to care about.
1400052181|5.0|Ordered a box of 20 books for an University book club. It came very quickly. Thank you for your efficiency.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I bought this movie as a Christmas present for my parents who are elderly.  They watch a lot of TV so I wanted to give them something different to watch.  They enjoyed this movie very much and said they would watch it again soon.  Good buy!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I ordered this Kindle cover along with my new Fire. Afterwards, I looked at some of the reviews and saw some low ratings, so I was a bit \\"antsy\\" whether I'd like it or not. Whenever it arrived, I discovered it fits perfectly and melds right onto the product. $40 would have been a lot to pay for it, but at 1/2 price, it's affordable and serves to protect the device.  The cover for my old Kindle was zippered, and I liked having a space to store ID cards or small bills for snacks rather than take my wallet, so I miss that part; however, that was bulkier and more difficult to hold.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I ordered the movie less than a week before Christmas as a last minute Xmas gift and recieved it within acouple of days. I was amazed and so satisfied. I will definatly order more products, if not all my gifts through Amazon from now on.
B002BWP49C|5.0|This was the best movie ever!!!  Loved it, seen it 4 times at the movies already!!! Can't wait for the DVD to be released!!
B005N0PJJO|5.0|I loved this book!  I actually cried at parts, and that is so not like me.  So emotional and driven.  I agree that even though it is in the erotica genre, it doesn't need so much sex- but I found it extremely believable that these two just couldn't keep their hands off each other- I remember the beginnings of my relationships and that's all there is!  Can't wait for the next one!
B005LBN7WQ|5.0|I've been a Westlife fan since 1999.  Their music is excellent, and they are amazing individuals.  I'm sad that they will be no more Westlife, but this is a great collection.  The DVD is absolutely priceless.  If you love ballad song, Westlife is a great band to listen to. <3 them so much!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is my first time with a tablet, and I take it everywhere. When I got my kindle, the first thing I did was download this app.  Love it, love it, love it! No complaints!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|great app for organizing notes and pictures. a must have for the business mixed entrepreneur in this highly competitive world.  thanks Evernote!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game was recommended to me .....and I love it.....great way to pass time in long car rides....one thing I like in particular is that you want to play more so you can unlock new games :)
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great fun. Works quite well and can get very hairy when you get over 25 days. You will not be let down by it.
B006O3MU96|5.0|I have Doodle Jump and Doodle Jump Christmas and they're both highly fun and addictive games. They both have tilt sensors and touch sensors to maximize the player's enjoyment. This version is also adorable no matter what the season. I also find it a bit easier than the original. However, the original does have different playing modes. I think that they are both a great idea to purchase and that this one is ideal for the new or beginning Doodler!
1451627289|5.0|The one thing I love about King's huge books is the way he allows you to lose yourself in his world.  Whatever world it is.  In this case, it's the fascinating idea of a person from our time traveling back in time and immersing himself in the late 50s/early 60s.  It's not always fast moving and action packed, but that's what I like about it.  The premise is intriguing and you find yourself wanting to find out what happens next.  And if nothing happens, that's ok too.  It's all about the journey.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is fun and enjoyable. It has so many different games to play! It is fun for the entire family.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is such a fun game, but some of the games take a while to learn and to get the points!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is pretty fun . the games r hard to unlock Bc of the points u have to earn
B0006HBZXS|5.0|My daughter's boyfriend was excited to get this DVD as a Christmas present since it is one of his favorite movies.  Thank you
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I am a high school student and love this app! I use my Android Tablet for many things in many of my classes and love it, and this makes a great addition because I can use the list or checklist mode for my homework planner ,plus I use it for grocery shopping. When in use I haven't noticed any ads either. The different note colors are good for organization too. Overall, it was a wonderful purchase!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like reading this Bible.  It is very easy to use, has a variety of reading plans,  and many translations available.  I have used it for a while on my phone, and the app on my kindle fire is easier to navigate and read with the bigger screen.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|THANK YOU EPIC PIXEL LLC. gamers are not complicated people. Missle command is a classic I grew up playing on the computer but actually plays better on kindle fire. Graphics update is great and RPG elements makes this game a no brainer 10/10
B00004RJ74|5.0|Clooney, Keitel, Tarantino, vampires, and strippers. That in itself rates 5 stars. This is an excellent film which includes quirky characters, great dialouge, with memorable scenes and lines. A different type of Tarantino movie: no flashbacks. Clooney and Tarantino play criminal brothers. Tarantino is the psychotic of the two and Clooney has to deal with him, reminding me of a Steinbeck novel that has nothing to do with this film.<br /><br />Tarantino demonstrates he is as talented in front of the camera as he is behind. Of course if you are the type of person who doesn't like cheesy topless vampire strippers, then you have no need to watch this film.<br /><br />F-bomb, off screen rape, blood, gore, strip club nudity, naked feet.
B00447G29S|4.0|The movie is great to begin with, adding 3D just enhances the experience. The 3D version does a nice job of providing depth as well as some occasional images that pop off screen. For those that want the screen to jump out at you, you will be disappointed, but in my opinion, 3D quality is both about the depth and screen pop combined. Too much of either and not enough of one can leave the viewer dissatisfied. While it does not have a great deal of pop, it does have enough and excels at screen depth.  I would rate this an 8.8/10 overall. It will become a family tradition around Christmas time each year.
0307891372|5.0|Where have the hours gone? Skyrim has sucked me in unlike any game ever has. To top it off this book is awesome. Every map is so detailed. You can get around anywhere using this guide in Skyrim. You dont have to have it to play the game but it opens up so many other areas you will miss without this. Great job Prima
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun and gets more and more challenging so you don't get bored. I love playing it when I'm really bored or when I have free time.
B003L1ZXCU|2.0|I think the main problem was the author was trying to write something to sell it to Hollywood.  It started out excellently for first half of the book and then it got way out of hand.  I didn't enjoy the second half at all.  All the characters got a lot dumber in order to serve a dumb plot.  For one thing, there was ZERO computer hacking/cyber war battle in the second half.  Everything was physical battle and some pointlessly long description of action sequences.  For a book that was named after a Unix process, how could it get so far away from computer and cyber hacking.  That was the premise of the book.  Also, it never even touch some very important fundamental questions.  Was the all powerful Daemon actually following the instruction of the dead programmer?  Or did it have artificial intelligent and made decision itself?  Did it moved away from the intend of the original programmer?  These are very important question very sci-fi author will have to face.  That's why I don't even qualify it as a science fiction.  It's thriller with some techno babble wrap paper and got way the hell out of control because the author have to stuff so many action sequences in it.  And I never understand this, if the Daemon, or anyone can become so powerful why do you need a dead programmer as a plot device?  The whole point of the programmer triggered the Daemon event after his dead was that he could escape the penalty.  Yeah but if you can get so powerful so fast and you have no conventional moral then you can just go into hiding and trigger the daemon event, which the book never explain why it has to be performed by a AI instead of a smart human programmer.  I picked up this book because Leo Laporte's enthusiastic recommendation.  He own me 5 hours.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|indivual games wont hold your attention too long.  overall it is about getting points and opening new games.  a good time waster.
B004XJHBCE|4.0|It's not the fastest response but all around it's great. The easiness of organization and ability to customize it's appearance is fantastic.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|Like some of the other reviewers, I, too, wanted and expected to see many highlights of Margaret Thatcher's life and career. There was very little of that. It seemed like 90% of the movie was spent showing her elderly state of dementia. Yes, Meryl Streep did a superb acting job, as always. But I walked out of the theatre wishing I had not wasted my money watching it. What a huge disappointment.
B0063GORYU|4.0|game works well and is fun. It's well done. I like that you can get hints all the time. Good job.
B000093FLA|5.0|Such a great..almost cult movie, shot superbly WI egg a great cast. Must see, must own..will have to see it more than once.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I check it daily!  I love the multiple views, such as daily, hourly, radar,  weather alerts, etc.  The best part....it is free!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|started playing the games, some are hard but I keep playing to keep gaining points... You wanna stop playing but resume when ur bored... its ok, for when I got time to play.
B0012CH350|4.0|Received this item quickly. It fits the Smokey Mountain smoker perfectly and meets our needs when it comes to protecting the smoker from the elements.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This app is quite simple, however, id recommend it. I have not played any game quite like this, but it is an epic combo of angry birds, tower and defense.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|There are so many different programs out there that \\"guarantee\\" results, and each one has it's own pitch/take on the best/fastest/easiest way to reach your goals, but for me none of them worked long-term. I would get into the program, not see gains, and slowly fall off the wagon.  I stumbled upon Michael's \\"Bigger, Leaner, Stronger\\" and thought I'd give it a try. The first thing I noticed was how simple and basic the program was. Almost seemed too good to be true, but so often the simpler something is the better it works. I was surprised to see fat literally fall off me (I lost 20lbs of fat in under 2 months) and muscle mass build up faster than I had ever seen it. Even my friends were noticing how quickly my body started to transform.  I work out 5 days a week and am in the gym only about an hour. My diet is much less strict than so many other diets I've done in conjunction with workout programs, and my strength and muscle mass just keeps going up. This program passes the acid-test for me, it just works. Finally something that gets results. I would have paid so much more to have this program years ago, just glad I finally found it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great games fun to play. kids love how easy they are to understand. fun trying to unlook new games!  great app!
B005Z271Y6|5.0|I first saw Adele on SNL and she sang Turning Tables. I knew a star had been born. Today she sings from the heart to her audience, bares her soul and holds nothing back. She makes you cry and laugh and feels emotions. I love it that she writes her own music from her life stories; and she shares her self. Blu Ray is also the only way to watch her dynamo personality. The audience, too.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is one of my oldtime fav's!! I play it all the time! Best part is that it does not need wifi to work. So it can be played anywhere at anytime :-)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Truly an amazing piece of work.  Sad to have the series end but an awesome book to end the story of the Mocking Jay.  If you couldn't put down the first two, wait till you get into this book.  Not only will you not be able to put it down, but you will also be thinking about it when you are not reading it.
B004LL1HMY|5.0|If you're going to spend $$$ on music, buy albums.  They include digital downloads.  This one does not disappoint.  Fleet Foxes are one heck of a band.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I prefer the ESV translation for everyday reading and study. I checked out Crossway's official ESV app and this was better! The variety of translations to compare, the notes and highlighting features, the huge selection of reading plans, all make this an awesome app to use. Yet one of the best features is the audio format built in. On a Kindle Fire, iPhone, or any such device, this app is phenomenal, and doesn't make me miss a paper Bible when I can't have it.
B003ASLJKO|3.0|I enjoyed it more when I was younger but then again I used to believe this was a great country. You wake up as you get older.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|This star playing Batman is the best!! This movie is the best of his  two, so far. Christian Bale has many sides to his character, and he can play Batman because of it. HE carries a large sound effect with his voice, and Blu Ray makes it so real. I bought this one and The Dark Knight in blu ray. Awesome.
B0069UP2PI|5.0|When I read about this movie, I thought it would be your standard disease horror story.  It wasn't.  I really enjoyed the film because it took a thorough and dignified look at an epidemic.  It kept your attention but didn't sacrifice anything to do it.  I would highly recommend this (but not to the faint of heart).
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This version of Missile Defender brings back a lot of childhood memories, it's a great version of the original, and it plays great on the Kindle Fire, nice job!
B004EPYZXK|1.0|This is the worst movie ever. Not worth your time. Plot could have been told in about 10 min. Not sure what they spent all the money on. Did not look like they were in space.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|used to play the old arcade version... this is the way to of today. what comes after touch screen attacks?
B0063IH60K|5.0|this app is a great way to pass time while waiting for appointments or during lunch! makes you not mind waiting as much...in fact you feel like making your appointment wait until you're finished with your game!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Mr. Heath Ledger made a great movie, and this will go down in history as his finest hour. NO one has ever played the Joker quite like he does. He has it down to making you think he might be a villian in real life. Which we all know he wasn't. But he scored 5 stars from my whole family. This is the best Batman because of Heath Ledger and  Christian Bale.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is easy to play on the kindle fire. I love how you can tap on the card and it goes where you want it and don't have to drag it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good game for just relaxing. Put your Pandora on and play with music in the background. It keeps you occupied and gives you a good time out.
B0063IH60K|3.0|pretty good game good to pas time worth downloading classic game.  well I like it and u should try in
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Possible Spoliers<br /><br />What happens when you work so hard for a part and you finally get it? Well for a ballerina named Nina (Natalie Portman, \\"The Professional\\") it starts as a great wonderful feeling but jealousy and perhaps some insanity leads to her feeling everyone is out to get her. Once she lands the role in a retelling of Black Swan her director (Vincent Cassel, \\"Brotherhood of the Wolf\\") seems to take even more of a liking to her, which a former ballerina (Winona Ryder) tries to warn Nina about. Of course a new upstart comes in (Mila Kunis, \\"Friends With Benefits\\") and Nina's obvious mental grip loosens as she is determined to make this role happen and give her greatest performance.<br /><br />While this sounds like fairly typical writing in normal circumstances, director Darren Aronofsky (\\"The Wrestler\\") handles it quite well as he presents a true obsession by nina gone horribly wrong as it all seems to be in her head, or is it? It is quite creepy in parts, there is the much talked about scene between Kunis and Portman which doesn't actually take away from the film like some of those type of scenes do.<br /><br />What I enjoyed about Black Swan was it was fairly relentless in it's portaying of Nina's descent into madness, also showing some aspects of her life that show how it isn't too shocking she was mentally unstable even more so as the movie went along. The performances are great, Cassel does well as the director, Kunis does well also as does Ryder but to me the two standout performances are by Barbara Hershey as Nina's mom and of course by Portman herself as this is a career defining role for her. Its well worth watching and doesn't disappoint. **** out of 4 stars.
B004XRMQCQ|5.0|from TheMetalObserver.com  \\"The angular and deliberately old school band logo, the Metal Blade logo, band members festooned to the hilt in black leather, a ridiculously over-the-top press sheet stressing blood, fire, and owls (?)... Yep, I was more than convinced that yet another retro Thrash workout was on the table, a prospect I really did not relish in the least bit.   It is with great pleasure, then, that I can report that my preconceived notions were all but blown to smithereens as soon as the first notes of the title track started reverberating through the air. Sweden's IN SOLITUDE are all about the old school, yes, but they've skipped the Thrash trend entirely, opting instead to exhume and reanimate the corpse of early MERCYFUL FATE. Seriously, if you love stuff like \\"Nuns Have No Fun,\\" \\"Melissa,\\" and \\"Don't Break The Oath\\" - which any self-respecting metalhead should - then go right ahead and say hello to your new favourite band. \\"The World, The Flesh, The Devil\\" is so rigidly old sounding that you'd swear the members' musical clocks stopped at around `83/'84. Aside from the legendary Danes, there's also some tasty smatterings of ancient CIRITH UNGOL and MANILLA ROAD strewn about here, and the end result is a seriously fun rollercoaster ride that dips, dives, and blasts right through all manner of old school Heavy, Doom, and Power Metal.   One aspect that immediately counts in the band's favour is the fact that the songs all have a tangible feeling of `completeness' to them, and they don't all just rush the listener to that oh-so-important catchy refrain. It's very un-tacky, in other words. The majority of the songs remain steadily mid-paced, the (relatively) high pitched delivery of Pelle Åhman invokes King Diamond at every turn, and the guitar leads simply kick ass. The infectious melodic cadence of songs like \\"Poisoned, Blessed, And Burned\\" and \\"To Her Darkness\\" is undeniable, and the epic closer \\"On Burning Paths\\" builds up to such a triumphant gallop that you cannot help but grin from ear to ear.   Bottom line, if you seek an album that shamelessly harkens back to the halcyon days of early 80s Metal and basically rocks like it's nobody's business, then put on your leathers, loosen your hair, and bow down at the altar of IN SOLITUDE! \\" - Metal Observer
B004CGI06Y|5.0|This book was everything I thought it was and more.  My daughter was thrilled! Will buy with confidence again .
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|Like PFC1, this is an inspiring CD/DVD Combo.  The music is vibrant and uplifting and illustrates its wonderful unifying influence.  The treatment of iconic tracks is well done and at times is very moving.
0439023513|2.0|I was completly enthralled by the first two books and was suffering from lack of sleep. I just couldnt put them down! I was really into the 3rd book untill about halfway through. It was not written as well as the others and then ended horribly. I was very disappointed. I don't even want to talk about it anymore.

Thank-you for used working as good as new, at half the price. Thank-you.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. After getting out of the movie theater I was just speechless. I am so glad that there producers and actors who will speak the truth and not compromise their values and morals but will be the light in the darkness. This movie truly touched my heart deeply. If people can propagate immorality, perversion, and evil. I believe that it is the believers job is to rise up and speak truth in love and display Christ's nature, and not be afraid that we might offend someone. Its sad but you do not hear many people who get offended by evil movies and immoral content... Its time for us people of God to be the light in darkness and be His love without compromising our values and morals. I would absolutely recommend this movie!

B0053VKP8S|3.0|This works great for most Digital to Analog. However, you will get the loudest, and most disturbing clicking/distortion when attempting to use this in a way where it's processing OTA HD signal.<br /><br />It will work for amps, PC'd, media PC's, etc. Using this for Broadcast HD will not work. Period. While I am rating this three stars, my opinion of it is more 2 1/2. It works...but I would have preferred something a bit more robust.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|There is something for every person wishing to study the bible and/or have a deeper relationship with God. I have a study plan for my 10year old, myself and one for my husband and I.

B004SDSSFY|5.0|I want to write a novel. I got this for free when it was a free app of the day just in case I ever wanted to use it. However now I want to use it but it is not the most current version (the always free main app, not the key). I had the option of update it to the Android Market version so I gave it a try.

0307959856|3.0|Preface: I am a die-hard Austen fan, and have re-read all of her work annually for at least 20 years. I've seen every film version, but have a hard time bringing myself to read any \\"Austen-esque\\" pieces, because it's so difficult to capture her voice authentically, and I find them just painful to wade through. This book was given to me as a gift. Although I am not a mystery fan, I know many who are, and I know PD James to be a good writer. This work definitely falls flat, but I have to applaud the effort, and I'm not sorry I read it.  First, the annoying things... for some reason, James felt the need to re-state a lot of the plot of P&P. I'm sure she was not wanting to leave her non-Austen readers in the dark, but I don't think any of the rehashing was necessary, and for those of us familiar with Austen, it was just plain annoying. She should have made the Prologue longer and avoided restating parts of P&P in the body of DCP.  The other irritating thing was that the timeline was completely askew. 1803 for the starting point of Death Comes to Pemberley may be about right, but you can't then weave in other books like Persuasion, and expect us to believe that Wickham at some time past was an assistant to Sir Walter AFTER Anne married Captain Wentworth. In 1803 Anne Elliott was only 16, according to the Baronetage Sir Walter reviews in the very opening paragraphs of Persuasion, clearly placing the starting point of that novel at 1814. I know it's nitpicky, but you can't force the timeline to work, and it's superfluous, so why bother? I can't remember now what the other non-P&P novel reference was, but it was equally pointless.  Elizabeth was also completely missing from this novel, it was really all about Darcy, whose steady wholesomeness is rather dull. She was never there to pull him out of his funk.  As I write this, I find I'm more dissatisfied than I originally thought. I'd take off 1/2 a star but I can't, so I'll give James the benefit of the doubt and leave it at3. Someone not as familiar with Austen's novels would probably be less bothered by the inaccuracies, and since I'm not a mystery fan, I don't feel qualified to judge one way or the other on that aspect of the book.

B005XQLBU4|4.0|good game. keeps me busy while on the throne. i like that i just tap the screen instead of the old school roller

0439023513|5.0|After reading the first two installments of this series, I of course had to get my hands on Mockingjay.  I feel as though Suzanne Collins is an absolutely phenomenal writer. The way she's able to describe details and put things into words is incredible. I wish I possessed this gift that she has.  While I feel like this book could have perhaps gone into more detail with certain characters, and some of the events that occurred were quite shocking and made my heart ache, this book is truly terrific.  I don't want to spoil the story for those that have not read this book yet, but I must say that everything that happened obviously happened for a reason, and though some of the things made me cry a river, I completely understand the vitality those components held to this book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is amazing for on the go. u cant beat this app especially for free. it is a lifesaver when ur kids get cranky in the cara.

B0063GORYU|4.0|ok to play, but hard to play on a kindle. I just wish my fingers were a bit narrower, and not quites o wide-it would make typing s bit EASIER!
0385534639|5.0|in other words, WOW.  It's almost two in the morning. I just finished the book. And I can't wait to talk about it!  I like period pieces about circuses (Gary Jennings' _Spangle_ is one of the best books I have ever read in my life). The blurb said something about \\"binding\\" and \\"magic\\" and \\"love\\" so I knew it would be something a bit more.  It was. I often had to reread earlier chapters to really understand what was going on in the part I was reading then. To me, that is the sign of a good book, where nuggets that may become really important later are dropped in places that don't make sense then, but eventually are crucial two hundred pages later.  Other reviewers have mentioned the descriptions of the tents, etc.  The book comes together towards two-thirds of the way in (much better than this review) and the amazement can start.  In other words, you will love how the characters interact, you will love the descriptions of the tents, trains, gowns, and such, and you will love the discussions about Important Stuff.  Even more amazing is that this is Miss Morgenstern's first published book. So hopefully we can look forward to more (and better!) stories like this!  Stop reading this and start reading The Night Circus.

B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|If you weren't a fan of the Oakland Athletics franchise prior to watching this film, you will be by the end. Baseball went from our national past-time to a game that is hard to love. With all the scandals and allegations, the crux of the issue is how the sport is run. Baseball, like all professional sports, is a business and, as such, decisions are made for profitability. Baseball unlike most major sports does not adhere to a salary cap and as a result, big market teams can (literally) buy up the major players. The evil empires (New York Yankees AND Boston Red Sox) have been attempting to purchase titles for years and the system pioneered by Billy Beane is the only legitimate obstacle (there is always chance). This movie examines where value lies in putting together a team and offers a real solution for small market clubs to compete with big market teams. Warning, there is not much actual baseball, but it is still a helluva picture.

1400063515|4.0|It is difficult to know what to make of Nassim Taleb's widely admired book. It would be easy to fall into line with the near-universal praise heaped upon the work. But without passing a critical eye over the work one would be falling foul of a type of sin that the author exhorts us to avoid - namely, following the herd.<br /><br />I probably ought to read the book again to see if a new or nuanced view of its merits crystallizes. After all the book is somewhat Umberto Eco-esque in being saturated with references to philosophy and thinkers and mathematicians and the like; one can become overwhelmed with the all the side alleys that need be explored. But time is short; there are so many books to read. So my review will just have to be based on just the one reading.<br /><br />Nassim Taleb takes us on a personal and philosophical journey of many twists and turns. But in the end he seems to be saying the same thing over and over again: Life consists of unknown unknowns and we ought to be cognisant of their power to overwhelm all else that precedes them (and not to trust those who think that they can predict the world). The unknown unknowns (as Donald Rumsfeld so eloquently put it - for which the biased and not very smart MSM panned him) are Taleb's Black Swans of the book title. They are very powerful and happen in the world of \\"Extremistan\\" where we actually live, as opposed to the more or less predictable \\"Mediocristan\\" of everyday life (with its Gaussian, bell-curve infatuations) which most people think is the full extent of existence.<br /><br />The book, with all its erudition and digressions into the author's Lebanese upbringing and sensibility (read cosmopolitan), is really a rather indulgent memoir. The author introduces us to all manner of his acquaintances, whether real, living persons or long-dead thinkers. The indulgences in which the author engages ask us a question: are we prepared to forgive these indulgences (to indulge the author) because he is just so brilliant and we are dazzled?<br /><br />Well, the constant sniping at bankers, Frenchmen, economists, financial traders & quants and a host of other miscreants does become tiring. Nassim Taleb is shouting out at us that he is the smartest person in the room; just look at all of these dullards of whose measure I have, he asserts. Well, if he is the smartest person in the room and he has brightened the world considerably with his enlightening utterances then we should be prepared to consider indulging him his excesses. My jury is out.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Nasim Taleb with his primary focus on our economic life (he was a trader in a former life) has made some pertinent and valuable observations. The 2010 edition I read contained a 70-page supplemental section (\\"On Robustness and Fragility\\") that  expanded on the 2007 original. Here the author discusses risk at greater length and addresses some of the issues raised since the publication of the original book.<br /><br />Most valuable are his \\"Ten Principles for a Black Swan-Robust Society\\". Here, he makes some excellent suggestions (such as, no company/organisation should ever be \\"too big to fail\\" = Principle 1: \\"What is fragile should break early, while it's still small\\") which, if followed by governments and the corporate world, would serve to greatly lessen the frequency and impacts of Black Swan events, and to afford us a much more healthy economic life. So, we don't just have fancy theorising from an admittedly clever and erudite author; we have practical prescriptions for a better world. For this the author gets my big tick of approval, and another star in the ratings (as if he needs my stars!).<br /><br />I will re-read the book at some point to see if any of the ideas presented percolate a little deeper, or whether there was no more substance than I gleaned at first blush. It just may turn out that the book is a sort of epistemological (a word Nassim Taleb simply loves) symphony that requires many a reading (listening?) to fully appreciate all of its many nuances.<br /><br />Meantime, I recommend the book as worth the read. It has many good ideas and is nothing if not thought-provoking. Reading the book will enable the reader to judge where he stands on the brilliance or otherwise of the book and compare his views with that of the opinion-maker reviewers who have so elevated this work. So it might be a learning experience for the reader in more ways than one.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|My boyfriend was always told how good the Sons of Anarchy is. I got it for him for the holidays. He loves it. Can't stop thanking me especially that he also rides a motorcycle. Can't wait to get him season 2.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Sarah's key written by Tatiana De Rosnay takes place in Paris, France in July   1942. During this time the Vel d' Hiv was taking place, which was a communist historic   period. This story persists to revolve around the Vel d' Hiv roundup. The roundup of   Jewish families in France made by the French police, who later handed over the Jewish to   the Nazi government. Later in the story, the present encounters one of the pasts effect on   the Vel d' Hiv, in the year 2001. Such effect prove to continue to make astronomical   changes of the lives in the novel.     This novel begins by introducing the time period of 1942, which was the era of   the Vel d' Hiv. Here we get introduced to Sarah Starzynski, a ten-year-old girl. Sarah is   taken away with her parents by the French. To protect her brother, Sarah locked him in a   cupboard thinking he would be safe there until she returned. That night the French arrest   Jewish families and take them to the Germans. Then we are introduced to a different time   period. It has been nearly 60 years since the Vel d' Hiv and it is the year 2002. Julia   Jarmond is an American journalist. She begins to investigate the roundup of 1942. She   then takes an interest in learning about Sarah and what occurred in the year of 1942.   As the novel begins, Sarah and her parents are arrested. They are taken away by   the French to an arena. In this arena Sarah knows what is going to happen to her. All   Sarah can think about is her brother Michael, who is locked in a cupboard. People all   around Sarah are dying of hunger, thirst, sicknesses, and many are committing suicide,   knowing their future. Here Sarah has a choice, escape or die. Nearly 60 years later we   have Julia, the journalist. She is investigating about the Vel d' Hiv and begins to uncover   things about Sarah. She has an interest for her. This leads her to much more knowledge   about Sarah that her family didn't even know about.       This book is amazing. I recommend it to everyone who has an appropriate age   and maturity. While reading you will not want to stop. You will want to keep turning   pages.

B004MC8CA2|4.0|Love this app...a mother of two young boys it's difficult to attend bible study...this app quenches my thirst for the word...
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The first 2 books were great but I try reading the third on my fire and.it won't. Even load now I tried removing and redownloading this and it wont work help I did not plan on wasting money thanks
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a work out for your mind. very entertaining.its challenging and mind boggling but keeps you on your toes.my kids enjoy the games.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is an awesome. game you and by you I mean everyone I think you should suggest trying it (awesome! !!!!!!!)
B005FVA3LK|5.0|It's got a lot of great stuff that I didn't previously have, which was nice for a change.  Felt like the price was fair for the volume of material present in the box set.  Great addition for any U2 fan - the photo books is really something special as well.  On a scale of 1 to AWESOME, it's AWESOM.5
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it really just good to pass the time. Lol like waiting for a bus that's running late, or if you cant sleep.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Great game! Gameplay is smooth. Simple graphics add to the fun. Hard to upgrade in later levels due to building repair, but otherwise tons of fun!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy this game. its very fun. I don't want to write this review I just want the points I get for writing it
B0036XN2L2|3.0|This is an OK album, but by their own admission the Scorpions were trying to reincorporate the elements from their most popular period into a new album (\\"If you take the best song elements from the '80s albums, and put these on one album, you come up with the Sting in the Tail album. So in this case we tried to re-invent the Scorpions sound from the '80s, using the same DNA after putting in a modern twist, to make it sound like today's music.\\" Rudolf Schenker). And it does sound like their 1980s stuff, but almost self-consciously so.  It's worth adding to your collection, but what's missing is, in my opinion, what former drummer Herman Rarebell brought to the band [[ASIN:B005V8UE8Y And Speaking of Scorpions... The Autobiography of Herman \\"Ze German\\" Rarebell]]. In hindsight, it's no coincidence that Rarebell's time as a Scorpion was their most popular period, and his lyrics captured a rock and roll lifestyle of women, good times and humor that helped define the band. Examples: \\"Make It Real,\\" \\"Don't Make No Promises\\", \\"Another piece of meat\\", \\"Falling in Love,\\"  \\"Rock You Like a Hurricane\\", \\"Blackout\\", \\"Arizona\\", \\"Bad Boys Running Wild\\".  Still like the band, and the album's not bad, but I don't listen to it as much as Lovedrive or Animal Magnetism
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it give me something to do when I'm at home all day. and the kids love there a lots of games for them to play
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app. It offers many bible translations, wonderful bible reading plans and devotionals. Since I have downloaded this app, I have been reading the bible much more than I ever have before and my relationship with God and my relationships with my family and friends are growing stronger every day. Here is the big BUT...since the latest update, it has been very laggy and buggy. Constant errors and sorry...can't connect with server errors. This happens both on my kindle fire and my Motorola ATRIX. Fix the bugs and I will give it 5 stars.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Really entertaining, and so fun to play over and over again.  You think the concept is boring and too repetitive but it really is fun and addicting. Give it a try, you won't regret it!
082300659X|5.0|This is one of the art/instruction books that I put at the top of my list. The guided lessons really helped me to improve my skills and my ability to \\"see\\"what I am drawing.
B0063GORYU|4.0|this game is amazing. it is really fun. I love playing spider. it is super addictive and you will not regret downloading this app.
0545265355|5.0|Very good books great price and fast shipping my daughters and myself are enjoying them tremendously. Books were new and handled with care.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|If you grew up in the 80's (like me) hanging out in arcades playing real pinball machines and other classics, you'll love this. Most other pinball apps I've found are in 3D with graphics that tilt in a kind of virtual reality way that I dislike (gives me a headache!), but this does not. So fun to play; I really love it!
B005C9YZIW|5.0|I've been a fan of Planet Earth for years. I finally decided to buy the blu-ray set, and I have to say I'm impressed. It wasn't even that expensive, especially once you consider that you are getting six blu-rays.  The PQ is amazing considering this was recorded in 2007. AQ is also outstanding. I've learned so much from this show, and the wonder it inspires is totally worth it. David Attenborough is one of my favorite narrators.  My only knock is that I would have preferred a plastic blu-ray cover instead of cardboard. Plastic stands the test of time better, but it's nothing too major. The discs are the reason I bought this, so I think it still deserves five stars.  Check out Frozen Planet if you're a fan of this series. As of 01/17/12, the blu-ray isn't out (US). BBC- I'm patiently waiting :)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games themselves are fun and varied, but I hate having to deal with the ads. Its nearly impossible to unlock some of the games unless you agree to install this or that game for so many points.
B0040ZPLBY|5.0|An excellent family based show with strong production values and a solid cast.  I predict great things of the lead, Colin Morgan.  Sufficiently deep to satisfy adult viewers and understandable for younger viewers, the plots are entertaining and fresh.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|Gestures are great (page forward, page backward, go to the top (or bottom) of page, refresh all with a gesture, you can even create a custom gesture to pull up a bookmarked webpage).  The way it handles tabbed browsing is cleaner and more traditional. I like the way it handles bookmarks with a left slide. I haven't even messed with addons much.  I can see how it might not be as good on a phone (with the smaller screen size), but on a tablet (even a 7\\" tablet), it is 1000 times better than the stock browser.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This app is really good for notes, I always have my notes for class no matter what computer I'm on.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|excellent album. i love the song. it is  very creative. gaga is reaaly an artist. gaga you are the best. keep doing what you re doing.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|highly recommended. buy it!!! worth the price. amazingly fun! fast, addictive and simple. great sounds! thanks for doing a great job!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I am not sure if there is anyone, especially those of us who keep up with news in the entertainment world who has NOT heard of this glorious series - and that definition is perhaps an understatement. Considering the Brits saw this a good three months ahead of us, it is fair to say that if one wants to, it was as easy as a simple Google search to find out what happened in the halls of Downton Abbey during its sophomore season. More than just one scandal befalls the house of Crawley.<br /><br />The date is November 1916 and heir apparent to the Downton Abbey estate Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens) is in the thick of the fighting in the British army. He has parted with Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) on less than pleasant terms, which is why everyone at the Crawley house is unnerved when he returns on leave with his fianc&eacute;e Lavinia (Zoe Boyle) in tow. Lord Grantham (Hugh Bonnville) is unhappy with his lot as a Colonel in name only and not on the battlefield. His American wife, Lady Cora (Elizabeth McGovern) has become occupied with turning their home into a convalescent home for soldiers who still need to get mentally stronger. This leads Lord Grantham to confide in the new housemaid (Clare Calbraith) whose own life is one of hardships and complications. Mary sets her sights on a powerful business man (Iain Glenn) who comes from new money which makes the Countess (Maggie Smith) unfriendly with her granddaughter's betrothed - and if Mary doesn't watch herself she may just hand the man the power to destroy her. Meanwhile, Sybil (Jessica Brown-Findlay) finds her purpose in nursing and Edith (Laura Charmichael) feels left behind and quite without purpose during a time when everyone should be doing their bit.<br /><br />Downstairs... Bates (Brendan Coyle) return from London and happy reunion with Anna (Joanne Froggatt) is cut short by the return of his greedy wife (Maria Doyle Kennedy). The new house maid Ethel (Amy Nuttall) finds herself in a world of disgrace and ruin after one too many bad choices - choices that force Mrs. Hughes (Phyllis Logan) and Carson (Jim Carter) to find her replacement. And William (Thomas Howes) defines a true hero... while Thomas (Rob James-Collier) proves just what a true coward he is.<br /><br />With so much going on, one might wonder just how it could all be squeezed into and resolved in a mere 10 hours. Creator Julian Fellowes does a stupendous job of it, although true to any good seasonal production, not everything is resolved to the satisfaction of his audience. Certain characters are not given a neat ending and others are given the ending that fans have longed to see. What is so lovely about this series is its insignificant way of presenting families and the events that cause them sorrow and bring them joy. One such scene that this idea calls to mind is a moment when Robert receives joyful news and he walks down the halls gleefully calling out to his family as he leads a parade of women down the staircase. Or the dry-witted one-lines that Maggie Smith gets in as the starchy but fair matriarch of the family - she can say more with one look or one line than the rest of the equally talented cast can.<br /><br />Despite its tendency to disappoint fans with its clich&eacute;d writing, I found the follow-up series charming. To expect it to remain the same in a war-torn era is unrealistic. The characters are just as strong and if possible, the relationships are stronger yet; particularly within the Crawley family. Julian Fellowes wrote a beautiful relationship between father and daughters this season - Lord Grantham is such a softie when all is said and done as regards his girls and it is lovely. It might not be the \\"same\\" as series one but it is just as engrossing in different outlets. Besides if you do fall among those who found this slightly disappointing, I think the beautiful 2-hour Christmas special will forgive all.e too many bad choices - choices that force Mrs. Hughes (Phyllis Logan) and Carson (Jim Carter) to find her replacement.

B000068TPN|1.0|The disc would freeze off and on throughout most of the movie. I think I would have loved the movie had the problems did not exist.
B005ER6SNM|4.0|I saw the original uncut version with no subtiles, this is not that film.<br />Retired Adult movie star is talked in to working on a new \\"Art Film\\" and you<br />know he needs the cash, so lets get to filming. I have heard a lot of hype<br />about this master piece and have been champing at the bit to see it and I<br />must admit it is well made and the acting is top notch. Sick is the word<br />that should be used here and I must say this movie is only for the hard core<br />gore hound, all others should move over to the regular rated R horror films.<br />I may have to set through this movie again with English Subtitles but this<br />level of depravity tends to bother my thought process for a few days after<br />viewing. I did like the movie I am sad to say and I do look forward to<br />Srdjan Spasojevic next movie.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|These games are fun and test your knowledge and reflexes. They are all small quick games but the make the time pass. My kids like some of the games as well.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|IT READS THE BIBLE TO YOU.  YOU CAN CHOOSE WHATEVER VERSION YOH WANT AND WHAT VERSE YOU NEED TO READ.THIS IS GREAT FOR ANY AND EVERYONE.
B003L77GG0|4.0|Smallville has had its ups and downs in its ten year run.  It seemed to struggle the most in the middle seasons, but the later seasons picked things back up again.  The final season for Smallville is still one of the better ones. The things that made Smallville great are still present: Lois and clark's fantastic chemistry, fun cameos from DC characters, good overarching storylines, and use of the Superman mythology. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to shake off the problems that have often been an issue in Smallville.  Some soap opera-esque drama, poor cgi, and anticlimactic conclusions to story arcs.  Season 10's best moments are when it begins moving Clark closer to becoming Superman. Seeing him wearing the glasses doing the dorky Clark Kent routine is just great. Lois and Clark's growing relationship is so much fun to watch.  (I think Erica Durance is my favorite actress who has portrayed Lois.). There are some really great episodes in this season, with a few ones that are homages to other movies ( including the hangover, the matrix, and thunderdome). Obviously the main draw of any show's final season is to see how it ends. The finale here is a microcosm of the entire series, it's a mix of great and dissapointing moments.  The resolving of the season-long story is quick and completely underwhelming.  (what about all that talk where this would be Clark's greatest challenge?) You will see him in the suit, but it's a quick look so don't expect much there. The best parts of the finale are its scenes between Clark an Lois, and Clark with his family. The return of Lex Luther brings the series full circle and will be a cool moment for fans. The 7 years later final scene also pays some nice homages to the Superman films.  It may not have been a completely satisfying finale, but it hits a lot of things that will make fans happy.  It's not the greatest show made, but it's the show we love despite its flaws. If your a fan of Smallville and/or Superman you will enjoy the finalseason of Smallville.
B004A8ZWWO|2.0|If you have seen the trailer then you have seen the movie. Do not waist your<br />movie money on this one, wait for cable. I was praying that this cast of<br />has-beens could pull this off but they were given little to work with and<br />can not be to blame for this mess. Eddie Murphy better head back to his<br />voice over work on cartoons or slap his agent up side the head for handing<br />him this script. I remember when Eddie could bring in top dollar in a film<br />like this. Pass on this one.
B005ZUR724|1.0|After installing it required a 600+ MB download. The download always locks up about 150 MB in. Was never able to actually play.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game to play on your Kindle. I like the graphics and ease of play. Highly recommend this game.
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|Cancelled before its time, the fact that this short lived series can generate enough fan support to spawn a movie says it all.
B005NJ2K6U|2.0|I can't get past the start screen to even try this game. It locks on Galaxy Nexus/ ICS.  Uninstalling the app.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|Its good. But they could be better. However for the money its worth buying. The fact that you can control mic chat, bass, and game volume are convenient plus its a clip on. The sound quality could be better. Like when Im playing battlefield 3 the sounds if too high can get that real electronic white noise breaking sound. Thats annoying but its fixed by adjusting the volume setting. But in other games like skyrim ive heard sounds ive never heard or even knew were there before. All in all i think that its worth the price.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Definitely a kind of challenge to get them all. But overall I give the games a 3. The app gets a 4
B001AQO3QA|1.0|BEWARE BEFORE BUYING!!!!  Ordered the $80 version and received the the $50 UK import version. Can't believe Amazon goofed this. Returning soon.  I might have to find this version on another site because there is no way I'm ordering this again just to receive the UK version again.
0062024329|4.0|I always wanted to give this book to my daughter, but she is a lazy reader. This copy was the way I found to take the message trough. She loved it! I did not give the 5 stars because I read the original and that is a 5 star book!
B004G600A4|5.0|Great seller, shipped my dvd fast, and it was in perfect shape! I would definitely buy from them again. Thanks so much.
B005BDZN62|5.0|Good quality reproduction of a classic film....a pleasure to watch.  I'm glad to see these older titles remastered in a new tehnology.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|it was fun but I think it got boring after a while. I got the app for free and I'm glad I got it. Also I think it's worth the money if you have some loose money to just spend. if u are on a budget I suggests you don't get the app.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love using this app.  It has helped me in numerous Bible studies.  It is easy to use and has many downloadable versions.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|Although it could have been a little longer... it was enough to occupy her time for about a half hour. Haven't tried to relaunch it yet. Had to make this review.
0385339585|4.0|The first half of this book was hard for me to get through, for the simple fact that I didn't like any of the characters. But, as the story goes on, the main character, Nate, begins to change his life of being a drunken, wayward lawyer. The story of his repentance process, and the lady who instigates that change is very touching. I loved that the change wasn't just over night, but took time and patience. I always love stories where the characters change for the good, and this was no exception.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|I must admit I wasn't expecting any more than a 2-3 star movie before I watched this. However, although it is pure schlock, it's very well done and surprisingly enjoyable. The atmosphere of the old West (or perhaps more accurately the atmosphere of movies about the old West) is captured in the opening sequences when a cowboy named Lonergan wakes up in the desert, and apart from Lonergan's unusual bracelet it looks like a Western of the 'misunderstood bad guy' type. Daniel Craig is the epitome of the hard-drinking villain with a heart of gold and no memory of who he is and what he has done and the ruffians and townsfolk he encounters look and sound authentic.  Then the trouble starts, with mysterious lights, explosions and ultimately attacks from (literally) out of nowhere, causing a number of supporting actors to fly up in the air, hooked like trout, and disappear attached to flying machines resembling giant invertebrates. After a perfunctory \\"What the heck was that?\\" the rugged Westerners set out to track down the abductors of their loved ones, aided by a kid, a dog and an enigmatic woman (Olivia Wilde) whose simple rural outfit is offset by her expensive Hollywood teeth. The showdown on the Mesa has the cowboys and Indians fighting on the same side against a common enemy. The kid and the woman (though not so much the dog, to my surprise) have a chance to show what they are made of, and the grizzled old rancher (Harrison Ford) develops a new respect for those of different ethnicity provided, of course, that they come from the same planet. There's happiness and sadness in the ending and a bit of good old Western philosophy, too.  All this, and the biggest lava lamps you've ever seen. That can't be bad!
B0063IH60K|5.0|great free download. a challenging way to pass the time and exercise the brain. try it, I think u will agree.
B00164GDD2|5.0|Ghostbusters has been, since I was a wee lad, a favorite movie of mine.  It would be hard for me to review the flick objectively because of my deep seated love of it going back to my younger years.  I loved the cartoon, played Ghostbusters on the playground, had all the toys and my favorite was always Egon for some reason.  Maybe because of that cornucopia looking hair-do he rocked in the cartoon.  The great thing about this movie is that the reasons I loved it when I was little are different than the reasons I love it now.  Back then, I loved it due to the massive scale, cool ghosts and the idea that one could entrap them.  Also it had a giant Marshmallow man.  Nowadays, it's the humor that I didn't catch then, the great performances of the leads and the blue-collar idea of equating busting ghosts with that of being a fireman. Also it has a giant Marshmallow Man. It's a big comedy that puts all of these elements that I loved as a kid and as an adult and fuses them so seamlessly that makes it work as well as it does for as many people as it does.  I can't think of another high concept comedy off the top of my head the blends everything together so magically.  The special effects work very well for the time period and don't age as badly as you might think, but the movie doesn't work because of those effects.  Mainly it's the cast riffing on a terrific script and idea that's so absurd, they can make it seem a normal everyday thing.  Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson ground this thing and make it relatable to anybody who's just doing their job.  Their job just happens to be catching ghosts.  The blu-ray at first glance doesn't seem like it offers much, but after a quick look you'll find that its full of goodies.  It still has the commentary from the original DVD release that's very good, though now it no longer has the MST3K effect of their shadows watching the movie, but I can live with that.  You'll find a lot of fun docs, like the restoration of the Ecto-1 and an 1984 produced behind the scenes look.  There's a lot here about the making of the video game that I found interesting, as it reunites the cast and writers, even if it really has nothing to do with the actual movie.  Also available is the \\"Slimer Mode\\", which allows you to watch the movie with a trivia track and picture in picture interviews at pertinent moments of the movie.  It's very cool and informative.  Picture quality is great.  Yes, there is some grain to be had, but that seems to be how the movie was originally shot, so I'm not gonna complain about it.  The fact is, the movie is about as crisp and clear as it's ever been and it's the kind of movie you would definitely want to upgrade from the original DVD release to the blu-ray.  This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and the blu-ray version is, barring a chance to see it in theaters, the only way I would want to watch it from now on.  I'm very happy with it and it's a great price to boot.
0439023491|4.0|This book was very suspenseful, just as the first. As much as I enjoyed it, I was disappointed by the non-ending. I don't like books that don't have some kind of wrap up at the end. So, I didn't like it as well as the first.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this is a classic game  excellently redone for the phone! Simple and easy to play, but fun and addictive...another hit from epic pixel!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I highly recommend this series.  This book was amazing.  You follow the main character, the heroine, Katniss, through all the struggles she goes through.  From being reaped for the Hunger Games to trying to figure out who to trust.  I'm not all that good at writing reviews out but this is one amazing series.  I could hardly put any of the three down.
0307959856|1.0|The creator of Dalgliesh is intelligent, informed, and careful.  She writes credible dialogue and knows how to move a plot.  Whoever did this book (I refuse to say \\"wrote\\" this book) was simple-minded and halfhazard.  If you told me that the book came out of a 10th-grade high school assignment from someone with a movie-based understanding of Pride and Prejudice and no experience plotting murder fiction, I would absolutely believe it.  Somebody's lying to us.
B005FISBTO|3.0|The sixth season of dexter is probably my least favorite season so far.<br /><br />The sixth season focuses on religion. We see Dexter facing religion for the first time. I found this interaction to be boring and uneventful. Dexter's religion is the code and his interaction with new character Brother Sam seems to fake and unrealistic. Dexter just doesn't get religion and he has no reason too. The fact the season subtly displays a change in Dexter and how he interacts with religion and the code seems out of character.<br /><br />The main villains in this season are the doomsday killers, religious zealots who believe that the world is coming to an end. Edward Olmos is pretty convicing and acts decently (but all I could think of is Jaime Escalante). Colin Hanks delivers a pretty boring performance as Professor Geller's (Olmos) assistant.<br /><br />There were a few episodes in the season that I just didn't like and were probably unnecessary (\\"Nebraska\\").<br /><br />(possible spoiler ahead but doing my best not to reveal anything)<br />In the end the big surprise of the season isn't that much of a surprise at all. It wasn't a big wow moment as in previous seasons. It has been done before. Although one could go back in the season and see all the interesting things the director did to make the surprise work, it doesn't change the fact that I just didn't care about the surprise in the first place.<br /><br />The ending though will change everything for Dexter and whats to come. The last 30 seconds of the season really makes me wonder whats to come. I will definitely continue to watch, but this season just didn't do it for me.
B005K17RU0|5.0|the finest weather app, the only forecast l look to when checking for an accurate forecast. the weather in the northeast changes quickly, and accuweather keeps pace
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just as good as the other two.  Simply amazing, things happen that I didn't expect.  This may be my favorite Hunger Game.  It is also quite sad as the ending draws closer.  I love this series Suzanne Collins was simply amazing in creating this world. I highly recommend this series.  This book was amazing.  I'm not all that good at writing reviews out but this is one amazing series.  I could hardly put any of the three down.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to find your way to whatever passage you wish by choosing from the book (alphabetically or traditional list), then specific chapter and verse. Easy to type in a search for words or phrases as you would look up in a concordance. You may choose to download any of the following translations for offline viewing in English: ESV#, KJV#, NIV, ASV#, AMP, CPDV, CEB, CEV, DRA#, GNTD, GWT, GNT HCSB#, LEB, NIV#, NIV84#m NASB#, NCV, NET, NIRV, NIVUK, NKJV, NLT#, OJB TNIV, MSG, WEB. In addition, those marked with a # also include a feature in which you can listen by chapter.<br />You can use a highlighter to mark and then store notations. There is also a list of more by language than I care to count. Not sure how this can be offered for free, but I'm grateful for it. Quite a few more features, but I haven't used them. They are reviewed in others' reviews.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Spartacus Gods of the Arena is an awesome show. Filled with drama, blood, sex, and gore, I could not be more entertained.<br /><br />A prequel to the even better [[ASIN:B0043T2TNA Spartacus: Blood And Sand]], we see the House of Batiatus before the arrival of Spartacus. The series focuses on Gannincus,  because Andy Whitefield (the original Spartacus) had cancer and unfortunately has passed. Although Gannicus is not as cool or entertaining as Spartacus, there is plenty of action and drama to make up for it. We come to hate Batitatus and Lucretia even more as we see their despicable rise to power.<br /><br />If you like movies like 300 and Gladiator, I highly recommend picking up Spartacus Blood and Sand. In fact I would say it is almost a mix of 300 and Gladiator as many visual cues seem to come from 300 but the drama is more akin to Gladiator.<br /><br />I can't wait for the new season of Spartacus. Hopefully someone can fill Andy Whitfield's shoes.
B0050R0XEG|4.0|What a neat kit - very retro and fun - a bit daunting with all the small parts, but once complete you can cruise on down the retro road back to the 1960's - complete with LAVA LAMP !
B003O86FMW|5.0|This one is just as good as the first one and leaves you wondering what on earth is going to happen next.  Katniss' love life gets even more confusing, it was simply amazing again.  I again highly recommend it.  I'm not all that good at writing reviews out but this is one amazing series.  I could hardly put any of the three down.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I have LOVED this show. since catching it on TNT one morning. As the character's of Dean & Sam evolve it really draw's you in !! I never miss an episode, and have began ordering the series too lol I've even began watching it on the CW on Fri. night's when the new episode's come out. Of course I am a little lost, as TNT only goes so far before returning to season 1<br />If you like spooky monster killer's, and all the eccentricities which we do in normal live's I know you'll love this show too !! I watched \\"Dark Shadows\\" as a child but this was the 1st series, since Kolshak \\"The Night Stalker\\" which covered the same type material without the stupid suit's McGavin wore. OR the stupid paper he wrote for !! I'm addicted already, and they even like the old 70's rock i.e. AC/DC, Kansas, Blue Oyster Cult, B.T.O. that I listened to as a teen (and still listen to now along w/newer stuff of course lol). Buy it, and you'll LOVE it !!

B006Y5EMHM|5.0|I've been waiting anxiously for the premiere of SMASH since NBC posted the first sneak peek back during the summer, and the pilot definitely does not disappoint!  In a TV season that's full of \\"same old, same old,\\" SMASH is a breath of fresh air. A glimpse behind the scenes of the making of a Broadway musical is something we haven't seen a hundred times before, and with the talents of Anjelica Huston and Debra Messing helping bring it to life, I know the coming episodes are all going to be good fun. American Idol's Katharine McPhee and Megan Hilty (who sparkled on Broadway as one of the leads in \\"9 to 5\\") play actresses vying for the plum role of Marilyn Monroe, and each has her own strengths - McPhee's character (Karen) has Marilyn's breathy, wide-eyed innocence, while Hilty's character (Ivy) has Marilyn's voluptuous figure as well as on-state experience.  We also see the creation of the show through the eyes of the producers, the director, the writers, and various background characters (chorus performers, the writers' assistant, Karen's boyfriend and parents), through dramatic scenes and a nice mix of musical numbers. I found myself wanting to see more of each character, to get to know them better, and when the final credits rolled I thought, \\"Oh...what? Is it over?\\"  Count me as a committed fan of SMASH, looking forward eagerly to the rest of the season!

0525478817|5.0|I was alternating between crying my eyes out and laughing hysterically throughout the whole book. (Which, although disturbing to watch, makes this book the MOST ENGAGING READ ever.) If that wasn't enough, John Green is able to weave  words of wisdom that has the reader examining his/her own life. Yet the novel is still a truly realistic, raw story.  I'm ready to read it again even though I just finished it an hour ago!
B005BCE7FQ|2.0|The 3D was very blurry during most action scenes. At first I thought it was an intended effect, but it began to get annoying. I started hitting the pause button and looking closely at each image separately, left eye then right eye. The frames were out of sync, either the left was ahead of the right or the other way around. Not only were they out of sync, but one would be clear and the other blurry. I have a very nice LG big screen TV and thus far have not had this problem with any other 3D disc.
B006OV7S1I|5.0|A young woman called Marcy May (played by newcomer Elizabeth Olsen, remember her name) flees from an abusive cult and calls her sister Lucy (Sarah Paulson) to pick her up. Her sister, who calls her Martha, hasn't seen her in over a year and finds Martha deliberately vague about where she has been. Lucy brings her to the large home she shares with her husband Ted (Hugh Dancy) and Martha's time in the cult is revealed through intercut flashbacks. Branded Marcy May by Patrick (John Hawkes), the charismatic leader, the commune consists of few men and many women, most from troubled backgrounds. The women are assigned individual duties, but the one they all share is to sleep with Patrick. The film wisely avoids giving too many details about the cult itself and what its basis is, but fills in all the necessary details otherwise.  This 2011 indie thriller marks the debut of writer/director Sean Durkin who has fashioned a quiet, powerful psychological drama that introduces the world to a terrific new actress. Elizabeth Olsen, the younger sister of two very famous twins, turns in a bold, Oscar-caliber piece of acting that allows her to successfully break from the stigma of having world-famous siblings. She's a remarkable talent and establishes her own niche as an actress, becoming a star on her own terms. The film is strong on its own merits, but, once you've seen it, it's hard to forget Olsen and even easier to forget her famous sisters.  This is a terrific debut for Durkin. Labeled as a thriller, it moves in a low-key fashion that doesn't go for easy \\"thrills\\" and instead opts for a deeply unsettling tone. The story, which uses shifting timelines in an intentionally disorienting way, never clues you in to where it's heading, but holds your attention rapt getting there. Juxtaposing this with the somber mood and static cinematography, Martha Marcy May Marlene is riveting.  Fresh off an Oscar nomination, John Hawkes is quietly sinister as Patrick. Rather than playing the cultleader as flamboyant or inherently crazy, Hawkes plays him as a soft-spoken, gentle figure and comes off as so creepy without ever trying. Physically, it's not a radical departure from his powerful, Oscar-nominated role as Teardrop in [[ASIN:B003EYVXTG Winter's Bone]] but the performances are wildly different. Hawkes has been active for a long time, but it's been a mesmerizing ride watching him grow into his own as an actor, tackling such varied roles across different genres. He proves with each new performance to have an incredible amount of range and I believe his best work may still be ahead of him. With this and Winter's Bone he's showing himself as a force to be reckoned with. Choosing subtlety over bravura, rarely breaking from the soft-spoken creature he establishes, it's triumphant how his characterization of Patrick convincingly allows his presence to hang over the movie in the same way it hangs over Martha. Like Olsen, his performance is Oscar-caliber but perhaps too subtle to capture the eye of Academy voters.  This brings me back to Elizabeth Olsen. A beautiful woman in a strangely unique way, she has a very child-like look that betrays the amount of emotion she's capable of conveying. It probably helps the quality of her performance, making it so much more unexpected. She really plays this role beautifully and bravely where another actress in her position could've unwisely taken an easy route and capitalized on her name rather than her talent. It appears that Olsen has honed her craft and waited for the right opportunity to strike. Considering she gives one of the most depressing, daring, and impressive performances of 2011, she has made the right decision. This is an actress going places.  Martha Marcy May Marlene is less a thriller than a riveting, psychological portrait. It's distinctly separate from a Hollywood film, but too sophisticated for the indie label. Durkin's film is brave and unflinching, a film that could have only been made on the indiecircuit. This is not because of the film's controversial elements, which aren't too graphic, but the way he unwaveringly looks at the effect the cult has had on Martha and refuses to betray the very realistic scenario. The film's final shot is abrupt and ambiguous, but far from anticlimactic. An obvious metaphor, it brings just the right amount of closure that can be afforded to this story and character. An obvious metaphor, yes, but certainly not an ineffective one. This shot is frightening and unforgettable; a brave, sad ending to the film. It's so deceptively simple, yet towering in its impact. I know this may give the impression that the film ends violently, but it creates more paranoia with a simple, unmoving shot than anything horrific could have. Martha Marcy May Marlene is a late inclusion to my top ten list and is one of the best films of 2011, with a star-making performance by a most unexpected actress.  GRADE: A-

B004GXZ69W|5.0|I purchased this mouse for use at work since that's where most of my hours are spent five days a week.  I love the easy, smooth, ergonomically comfortable use of the mouse.  I used to work with the cordless Vertical Mouse at a previous job and loved that one, however, it was a little too big for my small hands.  I specifically purchased this one because it said it was for small hands.  At first, I was hesitant about purchasing it because it wasn't cordless.  I thought the cord would get in the way but it doesn't.  You hardly have to move these ergonomic mice around!  They are so comfortable for your hand and wrist too...which helps with my tendonitis.  I highly recommend this product for those with smaller hands.

B0041KKYD8|5.0|This was far better than the original, an instant classic that alot of people may not be able to stomach. I rented the movie & after seeing the rented version that was  \\"R\\" rated, I saw this had a UNRATED version, so I went ahead and bought this unrated version on amazon. I usually do not do that BUT since the  \\"R\\" rated rented version I saw was really good to me, I thought the UNRATED version on BLU-RAY had to be even better. I was not disappointed with the BLU-RAY movie at all. The only regret I had with this BLU-RAY set is that the  DIGITAL COPY DVD DISC that came with this BLU-RAY pack was  EXPIRED, I could not use it at all. The DIGITAL COPY (CODE) on the card inside the case said that the DIGITAL COPY EXPIRED DECEMBER 31, 2011. I bought this the first week of JAN 2012. From what I have been told by other people I believe that this EXPIRED DIGITAL COPY CODE goes for all of these I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE MOVIES.

0142000655|5.0|First, I must confess my bias as a reviewer of [[ASIN:0142000655 East of Eden]]. This was one of the three most influential books in my life. I first read it as a teen and then reread it 13 years later. I believe John Steinbeck is one of truly great American writers. Readers would do well to look for an unabridged version as many bookstores carry the many edited versions which leave out some of the most poetic descriptions of setting in the literary canon.<br /><br />The entire work metaphor for Genesis, specifically the story of Cain and Abel. If Cain and Abel are unfamiliar, reading the first few chapters of the Hebrew Bible would increase the appreciation for what Steinbeck accomplished. The story works fine independently, but the meaning is that much richer when the biblical inspiration is understood.<br /><br />The first third of the book cover the early life of Adam and Charles Trask, half brothers controlled by an obsessively militaristic father. The one-legged former private trains them with drills, marches, shooting, and discipline from the time they are boys. Charles, the younger brother, is stronger and more fearless than Adam. Adam despises his father's rigidity. In an irony that rings true, it is the latter who ends up doing two tours in the army and the former who embraces the sedentary life of a farmer.<br /><br />The relationship between the brothers is forever altered by the introduction of an injured visitor named Cathy. She wins over one of the brothers. The other loathes her. Cathy is the most important character in the book, though she is very far from a protagonist.<br /><br />The bulk of the narrative takes place in the Salinas Valley, an area deeply imprinted in the early American West. The finest writing of the 20th century may very well lie with Steinbeck's pages of description of the Salinas Valley.<br /><br />Not everyone will like this book. There is no real hero, as in many classic works in the English language. It runs over 700 pages. The pace is closer to an 18th century novel than anything contemporary. Still, the characters are richly drawn and incorporate facets of all mankind. The story is timeless. The prose unrivaled by anything since.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0143039431 The Grapes of Wrath]] and \\"Of Mice and Men\\" are more popular by far, but East of Eden best demonstrates the author's skill. Few works merit the overused term 'masterpiece'. This is one.anything contemporary. Still, the characters are richly drawn and incorporate facets of all mankind. The story is timeless.

0553801473|3.0|Coming off Storm of Swords I couldn't wait to get into Feast for Crows.  One thousand pages later, I was still waiting but not put off enough to dally very long on the purchase of Dance With Dragons.  Halfway through the read I finally admitted to myself that GRR wasn't going to get us anywhere with this thousand pages either.  Painfully slow character development, rambling \\"filler\\" descriptions of everything and me anxiously anticipating that if I just keep reading, GRR will finally make his story cohesive enough to warrant the excitement I felt in the earlier books. I gave this 3 stars because he writes beautifully.  I wanted to give it two stars to soothe my disappointment at GRR for not knowing where he's going. Except to \\"cash in\\" while the fire's hot (no pun intended, dragon-lovers)I can't see why this book was written.  The author obviously wasn't ready to tell his story yet.

B001AQMBJQ|5.0|There are no spoilers in this review. \\"Lost: Season 5\\" is really cool sci-fi. Season 5 has a lot of intensity, and is at least as good as Season 4. The story is picking up speed, revealing a lot more pieces of the puzzle, and putting a lot of those pieces into place. There are so many pieces now, though, that the story is very complex, on a par with \\"Twin Peaks\\", so it does not lend itself to casual viewing. In fact, as I watched I felt as though I should be taking notes. I never did, but I paid very close attention. The science fiction elements are front and center in this season, and a lot of fun. The characters also have a lot to do and a lot of difficult choices to make, so it's great to watch them. I'm very glad I did not give up on this show when it looked like it was going downhill in Season 3. If you enjoyed Seasons 1 and 4, then you should also enjoy Season 5.

B003OPUZYY|5.0|This is an excellently re-mastered and packaged box, although I would have liked to see more pictures from those peak Ten Tears After days. I'd seen them in concert quite a few times during that period - 1969-1973. There were many groups at that time that made the best music that cannot be compared to anything since. Grand Funk Railroad, Humble Pie, NRPS, Johnny Winter And,Led Zepplin, Jethro Tull, ELP, Yes, and Mountain, to name a few. Everything seemed to peak at that time. A very vibrant time for music.  Some groups still around today all seemed to have hit their high mark during those years. The best of the best - The Who, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, CSN,and Grateful Dead all had released their most prolific, creative, and enduring , classic albums.  Ten Years After was at the top of the heap. The five albums presented here are an example of Alvin Lee and Ten Years After signature sound. Some of he hits here: \\"Love to Change the World\\", \\"Love Like A Man\\", \\"Good Morning Little Schoolgirl\\", \\"Baby Let Me Rock & Roll You\\", \\" Me & My Baby\\", \\"I Woke Up This Morning\\", and \\"AS The Sun Still Burns Away\\" have so many memories associated.

B0032JTV74|4.0|\\"Glee: Season 1\\" is an exceptional show. \\"Glee\\" is a high school drama, soap opera, and comedy about the agony and the ecstasy of being a teenager, with great music. Although the show has rapid fire broad comedy and classic pop songs, at its core is a group of sympathetic misfits that pull on your heartstrings. \\"Glee\\" is closer to being \\"Freaks & Geeks\\" than it is \\"The O.C.\\". Though there is a lot of soap opera melodrama, like \\"Ugly Betty\\", this is no vacuous teen drama about pretty rich kids, but neither is it a fringe curiosity. \\"Glee\\" is about kids on the outside looking to be part of something that they enjoy, and it's very enjoyable to watch them strive.

B003O97W5K|5.0|Without retreading every review on here, this is one of those movies you may have seen as a kid and relished the mild gore and violence, just enough to chill but not damage. The only thing I will add to this is that Tobe Hooper probably didn't direct this movie alone. In fact I suspect that Spielberg had an eye over his shoulder throughout. The fact is, Hooper has never directed such a polished production before or after. Besides Texas Chainsaw, this is the only other notable film to his credit being that he is primarly a B-movie film-maker. Compare Funhouse that he directed around the same time. TOTALLY different style. I guess we'll never know to what extent Spielberg was involved, but from what I've read, he was certainly responsible for the look and the acting. Regardless, a great 80's movie.
B001TOD9VI|4.0|\\"The Wrestler\\" is \\"Raging Bull\\" for generations X and Y. I appreciate the quality of \\"Raging Bull\\", but I cannot identify with its 1940's New York Italian American characters, nor do I know anything about boxing beyond the \\"Rocky\\" movies. \\"The Wrestler\\", however, has Mickey Rourke, who I remember from \\"9 1/2 Weeks\\" and \\"Barfly\\", and the great Marisa Tomei, who gets naked again, following her nakedness in \\"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead\\". It's also about a professional wrestler who peeked in the 1980's, and it's '80's rock soundtrack speaks to his life and times. So \\"The Wrestler\\" is about a working class athlete with problems and hopes that I can recognize and sympathize with. This is a very well made drama, with great acting and storytelling. Marisa Tomei and her nakedness is a bonus, though her nakedness in \\"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead\\" is much sexier.

B001PPLIFU|3.0|\\"Quantum of Solace\\" has a lot of gritty and high speed action but not much else. They could have just as easily made this into a Bourne movie with Matt Damon. There are no sexy Bond girls showing a lot of skin. There are no gadgets from Q. There is no Bond theme music playing during the action sequences. There is no humor. There is no deformed villain. There is no Moneypenny. What we're left with is a big budget action spy movie that does not stand out from the crowd. The action sequences are very good but they consist of high speed edits, which are normally very inferior to a well crafted action sequence with few if any edits. The original \\"King Kong\\" had great action without edits. Orlando Bloom's very memorable attack on an elephant in \\"Return of the King\\" was beautifully done with no edits. The action in \\"Quantum\\" is still very good despite the fast edits, but I long for the old days. Reviewed 3/29/2009 after watching on Blu-ray.

B005URRCUY|5.0|If you've only heard \\"Lonely Boy\\" on radio, you're missing some tasty tunes. This offering from Black Keys is so much more. It's more focused, if possible, than the ever popular  predecessor. The car El Camino was sort of a hybrid of its time and so is this musical rendering-a bit rockabilly, a bit punkish (so sue me-it's my opinion).  You must buy this!
B006C45MRE|2.0|How on earth did this \\"movie\\" get made? There goes 2 hours of my life I cannot get back. Nothing about this movie makes any sense. But I guess todays' movie audiences are looking for action, not substance!
B000UJ48SQ|5.0|There's always been something of a fuddle about this movie.  It was not received well by the critics when it was initially released.  The main complaint has been that it's too long and too slow.  But that may have more to do with the time it depicts than the film itself.<br /><br />Anyone who's read European literature from the mid-18th century, or tried to imagine what it might have been like to live back then, could only love this movie.  Things didn't move so fast in the mid-1700s.  Some complain about the 1% on top now, then it was .25% and very few had the chance to get there.  Many who tried were charlatans like the star in this movie.<br /><br />So do yourself a favor.  Read Simplicisumus and Vanity Fair before you watch this.  You'll get an idea of what life was like in Europe almost 300 years ago, and you'll be able to savor the gem this movie is.  It's an excellent time machine.

B005XQLBU4|2.0|ive noticed as I played that the missles often don't go exactly where you tap.  I played it on a tablet with a 10&quot; screen, and ive seen the missles hit and explode about half an inch from where I pressed (and from where the dot that indicates where you tap).  they're usually close, but it can cause you to miss a lot in the later levels, which really irritated me, so I removed this game.  it would be great if not for that crucial fault.

B000001GAM|5.0|The 9th is my favorite Bruckner symphony and I wanted to compare and contrast some of the versions I know. Here is Giulini with the great Vienna Philharmonic in a live recording from 1988. I would place Giulini as one of the great Brucknerians, perhaps not in the most elite class but close to the top. Giulini's drawn out, contemplative style is wrong for many composers but absolutely right for Bruckner's music. In fact, this 9th is one of the slowest around, clocking in at an extra 10 minutes longer than the average performance.<br /><br />So in that sense, this is not a Bruckner 9th for beginners. For those that are already fans of the composer it can prove to be a great experience. Giulini makes the most of every transition, never pushing the tempo in the outer movements. The scherzo has great visceral punch and is played in a more conventional steady forward move. The climaxes are superbly built up and executed in the heaven shaking moments in the long adagio. DG's sound engineering is at it's best, giving a natural concert hall ambience.<br /><br />This is the most individual and profound treatment of this symphony I've heard in the digital era. As Giulini aged, he got progressively slower and slower in his conducting and he was already quite expansive to begin with. Many of his recordings from the 1980s and 90s are dogged by this mannerism. Not so with this Bruckner, because the elongated approach can work in favor of the music. One of Giulini's great recordings, for sure.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Having had Kindles for a few years I knew the value of protection with a cover. This cover does the job well. It keeps my Fire clean and safe from being sometimes bounced around. It was ordered from Amazon and met all the written guarantees. It was delivered on time and in excellent condition. I have had leather cases in the past and find them better suited to my tastes.But it does meet my needs. I would recommend it.
B00192KCQ0|1.0|I have been a old school fan of Metallica from back in the 80's. I kinda over look the crap that was Load and Reload if the next album had been great. I was let down. Anyway I said to myself that if this album was not the metallica I know and loved from the 80's I am done with them. Got the album and went WOW! This is one of worst albums they have ever put out! There is not one good song on the whole album. Even with the crap that is Load, Reload, and St Anger I could find a song or 2 that was ok or that I even kinda liked. If you want real Metallica get anything from Kill' Em All to The black album. Don't buy anything past that! If you want good bands that are from 80's and still stay to their roots. Get anything from these bands: Slayer, Venom, Mercyful Fate/King Diamond, Overkill, Testament, Sodom, Kreator, Destruction, etc.

B006O5XYWG|4.0|Contrary to what its title may imply, the film is about how apes acquired human intelligence here on earth at the present time. It is well acted, the ape who is one of the stars is very sympathetic, and the plot enjoyable. A doctor finds what he thinks is a cure for Alzheimer's and tests the drug, which causes a growth in intelligence, upon apes. James Franco is excellent as the very dedicated doctor who discovers that he is not as knowledgeable as he thought. The drug affects not only the apes, but Franco's family, and the entire human population.

0061537969|5.0|Our beautiful golden retriever, Toby, died on New Year's Eve, 2011. He was 12 and a loyal companion throughout my son's childhood and into adulthood. Hearing my heartache during a phone call, my daughter insisted that I order this book on my kindle the instant our conversation was over. She promised it would help. Whatever one's belief regarding the afterlife, this book provides a unique perspective from man's best friend, and I found it very comforting. I often observed Toby's expressions, from his puppyhood onward, and I know a thought process was clearly working as evidenced by the pictures I have of him. On his deathbed, I held his head between my hands, talking gently to him, telling him how much we loved him and appreciated his unconditional love and devotion all his years. I told him he could go when he needed to, and he looked up at me with crystal clarity in his eyes, his expression one of such love and understanding, I will never forget it. A copy of this book is being sent to my son.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I added this to my Netflix queue on a whim. I was hankering for some period drama/romance and craved something new aside from my go-to Austen. I went into North and South completely blind. I popped in the DVD on a random week night and stayed up to watch the first two episodes, then wanted to tear my hair out because I couldn't watch them all in a row. I have since seen all 4 parts (I made my friend watch it with me)and it was the most beautiful, tragic, moving love story I have seen in years. The last 15 minutes makes watching all of the painful struggles and hardships the characters go through worth it. The train scene made me cry more than once. It is one of those gooseflesh inducing scenes that you'll never forget. The soundtrack (which is equally beautiful and haunting) will get stuck in your head.<br /><br />North and South is a must for any period romance fan. It now holds a special place in my heart and on my DVD shelf. Richard Armitage is handsome, brooding(much too good for Miss Hale) and  quite possibly my new *movie boyfriend*, while Daniela Denby-Ashe is the perfect Margret Hale, idealistic, bold, likable and flawed. The supporting cast is wonderful and the scenery manages to make the dirt and grit of an industrial town seem poetic.<br /><br />If you had any reservations about this miniseries set them aside and watch this.<br />You won't regret it. I promise.
B006YLGDQE|5.0|Having greatly enjoyed Season 1 of Downton Abbey, I was looking forward to Season 2, and I found it as captivating and engaging as Season 1. In Season 2, the time frame is from the Battle of the Somme in 1916 to the Spanish Flu Pandemic of 1919. For those unfamiliar with the series, I would advise watching Season 1 first as it provides a lot of background information on many of the characters, as well as continuity.<br /><br />Change is a major theme this season - the Great War has wrought many changes to the residents of Downton Abbey. The Granthams, i.e. the Earl of Grantham (played by Hugh Bonneville); his wife, the American heiress, Cora, Countess Grantham (Elizabeth McGovern); their three adult daughters, beautiful Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery), bitter Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael), and idealistic Lady Sybil (Jessica Brown-Findlay); and of course, The Dowager Countess Grantham, the Earl's mother played by the incomparable Dame Maggie Smith.<br />The usually robust and confident Earl (I love Hugh Bonneville's portrayal of the benevolent Earl) feels somewhat out of place this season as he yearns to be of use to his country, yet all he gets is an honorary rank in the military, and is not considered for active duty due to his age. Mary is melancholic over her failed romance, Edith wants to master driving so that she can take over in case the family's chauffeur is called up to fight, and lovely Lady Sybil goes off to nursing school.<br /><br />The staff of Downton undergo changes of their own, and experience both ups and downs. Brendan Coyle who plays the Earl's faithful valet, John Bates, experiences some serious challenges when his estranged wife, Vera (Maria Kennedy) turns up. Tom Barrow (Rob James Collier), the footman, is away at war, but finds the experience unnerving to the point that he resorts to drastic measures to make his way home.<br /><br />There is good balance between scenes at the warfront and scenes at home. The battle scenes are credibly done, evoking all the fear and horror of the war. But I admit I was more interested in the machinations back home at Downton, and watching familiar and new characters resort to manipulation, scheming, and intrigues. There is a short, 10-minute segment prior to episode 1 which shows the setting for Downton Abbey, i.e. Highclere Castle in Hampshire, and includes interviews with the present owner as well as the director, producer, and cast members of the show. The streaming via Amazon Instant Video is of high quality, with clear, crisp images and no interruptions.war.

0307477479|3.0|I came to this book in an interesting way. I was watching \\"The Chris Matthews show\\" and Joe Klein, the writer, recommended it. So I said what the hell and bought the Kindle version. Overall impression? Good, but not great. I mean I enjoyed it but I'm not so sure it deserves a National Book award. Maybe it got that because she fairly successfully pulls off the time-jumping and tense changes from chapter to chapter. But I found that I wasn't overly interested in the doings of a bunch of punk rockers. I lived through that era but it didn't particularly resonate with me. And the story was pretty good but a lot of nights I just didn't feel like picking up the book.  So, for me, good book, not great. And so I confess that I don't know what all the hype was about.

B004ECDNJU|5.0|I've been playing computer games for almost 40 years. After all that time, it's refreshing to come across something new. In this game you're directing colored bursts of dragon's fire (that looks remarkably like drops of paint) through a series of valves you control, to a reservoir of the same color. The trick is figuring out the right combination of valve settings to dispose of each burst.<br /><br />Pro:<br />+ In my experience, a new kind of game and relatively fun<br />+ Nice graphics and sound<br />+ Many different levels to play through, similar to advancement through a game like 'angry birds'<br /><br />Con:<br />- I'm embarassed to say, I haven't quite gotten the hang of it yet, it's a little hard.<br /><br />This is a high quality game, and as I said earlier, is a new kind of game, at least in my experience. It's not as groundbreaking as something like Tetris or Myst or Wolfenstein 3D was, but it's not just another puzzle game either. Definitely worth a shot!<br /><br />Note: I got this as the free app of the day and played it on my Kindle Fire.
0439023483|3.0|I was debating between giving it 2 or 3 stars. Would have given it a 2.5 but apparently that option isn't available so I settled on a 3 because I was entertained as I read it, the action, suspense, and that whole thing of survival/living off the earth kept me interested. But there were some issues.  SPOILERS  - First of all, the world wasn't fleshed out enough. We're told that District 12 is in Appalachia, which makes sense because of the coal mining. But this district has about 8,000 people. Which made me wonder how big Panem is as a whole. Panem is in what was once North America, and the Capitol (the main city surrounded by the outlying 12 districts) is somewhere in the Rockies.   So...exactly what is the total population of Panem/North America? Because unless the other districts have a much higher population than District 12's 8,000, they are all very spread out for such a small population. Also, how are other parts of the world faring in this unspecified future time period? There is never any mention of areas outside of North America.  - I never understood some of the future technology. I understand this is Sci-fi so the tech might seem odd or unbelievable, but certain things weren't explained at all. One thing I noticed was how the tributes were being filmed at all times. Katniss and Peeta are filmed the entire time they're hidden in a cave as a storm rages outside - how did this work? There's nothing around them. Are they being filmed somehow because of the tracking devices inserted into their skin? Are there tiny cameras in the air around them? This is never explained in any way.   And I couldn't help wondering how far their privacy extended, about how people could conceivably watch them while they preformed acts like bathing or relieving themselves. Not that these types of activities are discussed in any great depth, or at all. I don't think Katniss ever talks about using the bathroom while out in the woods. We didn't need to see it happen of course, but itwould be a struggle to do this in the forest much like finding food can be a struggle, so you assume it will be mentioned.  - Another thing that wasn't fleshed out a lot were the characters. Only a handful of them get any major focus, and even they are lacking a bit. You know just enough of them, but not enough to the point where they feel very real. Funny that Katniss ponders what her identity will be after she wins and will no longer have to spend her time hunting to feed her family. We're left wondering the same thing because that's the bulk of what we see of Katniss.   Luckily, most of the story has a fast enough pace where you don't notice it and it doesn't take away too much from what's happening. And the characters weren't necessarily bland. But at certain parts where things slow down and the characters interact, you can feel it. Beyond the surviver and hunter who knows her way around a bow and arrows, who is Katniss? There could be more there.  - There were a few \\"saving graces\\" that gave Katniss an easy way out of a bad situation, and it's unsatisfying. You pretty much know Katniss will live, and that's okay, because I spent much of the story wondering HOW Katniss would survive and how she would kill other people, how she would deal with the moral dilemma of hurting people she'd grown to care about to save herself, in a way submitting to the Capitol by losing herself and becoming their tool.  But instead of handling these tough choices that were intentionally set up from the beginning, they are usually done away with, in a way that makes it obvious the author didn't want to follow through with the grim nature of the story. Katniss makes only one direct kill, and that was out of revenge. Many of the kills she makes or is involved with are accidental, like when Foxface eats the poisonous berries called nightlock that Peeta had laid out for Katniss and himself. A nice way to kill off a very clever, strategic opponent who took food from others and prefered thetactic of evasion, which made an open confrontation less likely. But still a little too convenient.   Katniss rarely has to get her hands dirty, even though her possibly having to sacrifice morality in order to survive (for herself and her family as she says) was part of the drama. In this way she's absolved of a lot of guilt and responsibility.  It feels like a stretch when Thresh lets her go out of debt. The debt was because Katniss teamed up with Rue and avenged her death, but Thresh calls Rue \\"that little girl,\\" suggesting he doesn't know her very well, if at all, and the only thing tying them together is that they're both from District 11. It's a little hard to believe he would lessen his own chances of victory for the sake of someone (Rue) he has little connection to, even considering the mutual understanding the poorer people have about being indebted to someone.  The one that really got me though was when the rules were changed so that both from a district could survive instead of just one. The entire premise was that there could only be one victor, and the sudden change two-thirds of the way through was another one of those obvious \\"saving graces\\" that kept Katniss from making hard decisions (killing Peeta). If Katniss and Peeta both had to survive, it could've been worked another, more creative way instead of having the Capitol pretend to change the rules, them take back the offer, then be forced to give in because of Katniss' threat (both her and Peeta killing themselves when the Capitol must have a victor).  - The love angle that was played felt forced. Having Katniss care for Peeta made sense, it strengthened her moral dilemma, but the romance wasn't that believable. Peeta has apparently watched Katniss from afar for years and loved her at first sight - that alone doesn't help with the \\"realness\\" of it. Katniss \\"pretends\\" to love him for the Capitol's cameras because it helps them get more food and adoration from the crowd, but it's as though she startsto believe her own act for some reason we can't see. Apparently because...well, we don't really know why, we're only shown Peeta's kindness towards her and struggle to help her survive, and that seems to be enough. It so obviously sets up a love triangle between them and Gale, which feels unnecessary.  - Anyway, I wasn't aware of this book until I got it as a Christmas gift, so I didn't know about the movie or the hype. In general, it's enjoyable enough and held my attention, so while I can't say I loved it, I liked it enough to continue - I will get around to the 2nd one and see how it goes. But Hunger Games didn't fufill it's potential, mainly because of the issues above. It's more of a fun read than one meant to make you think a whole lot.

0439023513|1.0|As a huge fan of the Hunger Games books (this one being the exception) I was greatly, immensely, supremely disappointed in the final book.  This book was so bad that I don't even want to go see the movie because I don't see the point in doing so when the final movie (if the franchise makes it that far) will be nothing but a massive suck fest. I could go on and on, but I'll forego that pleasure.  If you want to read something fabulous then check out Cassandra Clare's Infernal Devices series: Clockwork Angel and Clockwork Prince with Clockwork Princess due out in 2013.
B001BNFR6W|2.0|I bought this series set for my sister for Christmas 2011.  The first set was defective, looked scratched & would not play.  I had it replaced and it was the same problem.

B0058FOB2K|4.0|Well I had my fears about the album considering how much of a let-down her \\"I Am\\" was, but I heard this album through and I have fell in love with Beyonce all over again. I feel she stuck closer to R&B this time around compared to \\"I Am\\" and I am very happy about that fact.  None of the songs are hardcore rave club songs like you would hear from Rihanna or Gaga or someone like them, but they are party songs like \\"Party\\"(of course) and \\"Countdown\\". Most if not all songs have a slick sound that leads into either an old school sound (\\"Love on Top\\") a retro or 80's sound (\\"Schoolin Life\\") or a sexy and smooth sound (\\"Dance For You\\").  For me Beyonce's voice either really does it for me or other times it is annoying, for example those moments when she seems to be doing a mixture of whining/straining (its hard to explain since I'm no vocal expert) in order to add pain or emotion to her voice I would guess? That can get really evident at times throughout the album. The one song that I appreciate most is \\"I Was Here\\" where she expresses her hopes of leaving her mark on the world when she is gone. This is no party track, its kind of a rough harsh track and I'll be honest I did get a little emotional hearing it because I believe the subject of thinking about what kind of legacy you'll leave once you leave the Earth is a heavy one to me and it gets you thinking.  While that might be an easy target for the skeptics, I appreciate her for putting a song such as that on the album.  This might sound weird but one word I would use for the album is \\"beautiful\\" and I am very happy to have this in my collection and any other fan of Beyonce should definitely give it a listen.

B005804NCI|5.0|Growing up in the 70's and 80's, most of my taste in music was centered around more hard rock groups.  I liked Fleetwood Mac, but didn't wait for the CD store to open up to buy the newly released CD.  Rumours had catchy tunes you heard on pop music stations but hardly ever on stations you listened to out clubbing on Friday or Saturdays.  It's amazing how time lets you listen to all sorts of music.  I heard Rumours at a friends house and really liked it, and went to the local big chain store to try to find a remastered copy.  Could not find one.  So when I saw that Rumours was out on hybrid SACD, I ordered one and wow!  This is simply a great piece of music from start to finish.  With the personal relationship amongst the band members there, the lyrics and music really jump forward.  To hear a younger Stevie Nick's voice in SACD is truely wonderful.  A friend jokingly told me that when people bought homes in \\"surburbia\\" during the 80's they came with a copy of Rumours--and I now see why.  It's a fantastic piece of music and truely deserving all the awards it won upon it's release.  I'd like to see  an SACD of the Tusk CD also (hint).  If you are a fan of Fleetwood Mac on any level, get this SACD.  It will simply blow your mind away with it's clarity and musicality.  Thanks to the folks who brought this to us.

B005LAIGLE|3.0|You used to be a smuggler, but you went straight.  Now you live in New Orleans, you're married with kids, and you run your own business.  You even supported your best friend's stint in AA.  And then one day, your little brother-in-law tries to copy your act, blows a drug-smuggling run, and ends up seriously in hock to a seriously bad man (Giovani Ribisi)...<br /><br />2012's gritty thriller \\"Contraband\\" stars Mark Wahlberg as the reformed smuggler, who must make one more good run to save the life of his brother-in-law.  He puts together a team and a plan to smuggle counterfeit US currency back from Panama on a container ship. His best buddy (Ben Foster) will watch over his wife (Kate Beckinsale) and the kids.<br /><br />No plan survives first contact with reality, and this one starts to go wrong in Panama, with Wahlberg and his team racing the clock and a gang of thugs to get back to the ship, with the counterfeit currency, before it sails.  But that won't be the end of the bad news.  Wahlberg faces a betrayal on board the ship, and one or two more back on shore in New Orleans.<br /><br />\\"Contraband\\" has a mission impossible-like conclusion, with lots of action and suspense along the way.  It's hard not to root for Wahlberg and his crew in what ends up being an entertaining movie; recommended.

B006CBSE86|5.0|I downloaded this from amazon.com the day it came out in the United States, and first thing in the morning, too! Now having listened to the whole album from beginning to end, I have absolutely no regrets at all.<br /><br />To start off, all I have to say is that I have found every track to be amazing, be it with lyrics, or an instrumental piece. Anette Olzon's voice seems to be able to work very well with the composition, suggesting that Tuomas now knows what works for her. Marco never fails to impress me with his high-flying, yet sometimes dark and menacing voice, so as to reflect the overall mood of the music itself. I would have to say that Nightwish were indeed very lucky to be able to hire him. Although the orchestration isn't on every track like it was with Dark Passion Play, the album still feels strongly unified, suggesting that Nightwish can still sound solid without such supplements. They are great musicians, after all and they show it.<br /><br />So, why do I think all of this about the album? To put it simply, it is a true, honest, down-to-earth work of art that invloved tremendous effort, and that is what any true music lover should be able to recognize. It was not made with the intent to sell to the masses, unlike all the over-hyped generic mainstream garbage that pollutes the airwaves here in America.<br /><br />Furthermore, I am sick of hearing all the anti-Anette B/S getting thrown around. Respect the change, and get over yourselves. You're not Tuomas, so it isn't your decision.<br /><br />Enjoy the music, fellow Nightwish fanatics!

B0063IH60K|5.0|I have tried other solitaire apps for my phone and they don't compare to this game. I can chose random draws or winning draws and it's fun either way. You can't go wrong with this game and you won't want to try a different one.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|Pretty good so far, just got to the third part of the first case.  Looking forward to. what happens next.

0439023521|3.0|Before I get started, I'll go ahead and tell you that the story is enjoyable and exciting.  At a certain point, the story picks up its pace, and gets moving in a really interesting and creative way.  Why did I give it three stars?  Let me explain.  The Good: The story is creative, at times very exciting, has a few good characters, and eventually has good suspense.  It's no news that Suzanne Collins can cook up a great, thrilling story.  However...  The Bad: A few things concerned me.  One, the main character (Katniss) was hard to like.  I didn't find her insight to be very exciting or compelling, and it took a very long time for me to care about the outcome of her character.  I felt like I was reading for the sake of seeing what Suzanne Collins would come up with, instead of reading for the chain of events.  There were no characters that felt particularly weighty to me, like I would meet them in real life. I have a feeling that this book was made for young adults, and more attention was paid to the action and less on the realism of character traits, which is okay.  On the same note of unbelievability, I feel like there's an essence of creative sabotage in place.  Without spoiling too much, there's a character who's name went into a jar once out of a huge amount of names, and just happened to be chosen.  It would've been more believable if the characters were more shocked, but there was more of a \\"what can you do?\\" attitude about it, which didn't really put me in their shoes.  Last but not least, the actual writing.  There are fragmented sentences everywhere, and if you've had an advanced high school or college writing class, it can make you cringe.  This is what it's like:  I went to the store.  And then I got some bread. But not before I got cheese. Good cheese.  But at first I didn't have the money.  And that was sad.  It's readable, but feels very amateur, and took away the solid foundation needed for me to get completely invested in the book.  There were also two occasions where a sentence flat out just didn't make sense.  An educated editor would've done this book a lot of good.  That's my personal experience with the book.  I'm not sure anyone else feels this way (my friends certainly don't), but if you're a little meticulous about the details of literature, let this be a warning.  Otherwise, it's a good read, and you'll get a good story out of it.
1582701709|5.0|I received the book in a timely manner. Looks brand new!  Awesome motivator :) Great book for someone seeking a great change in life.   I believe that you can find all the same concepts in the bible :)  Overall a great book when you need encouragment.  God Bless <3
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Thin, light I can watch a movie or lay it flat.  I have 2 other covers but finding a good Fire cover has proven to be a tough task.....I'm done looking now.
B0000DBK9X|5.0|Daft Punk is for the win. This video is too. Anime is generally for the win. Then you put all this together? Dang. It's fantastic. My head imploded. Well worth what I paid for.
014241543X|5.0|AMAZING! I loved this book and could not wait to read WHERE SHE WENT, which I did right after I finished the last page of IF I STAY.<br /><br />I was so hooked I read both in one day and started them again the next day (that is how she received a 5 star rating)!<br /><br />Gayle Forman rocks and weaves a tale of heartbreak, love and loss like no other book I have ever read. I absolutely fell in love with Mia and Adam...great characters with lots of flaws and beautiful complex souls.<br /><br />This is a book I will read again and constitutes my definition of the perfect YA Crossover book...because of the heavy topic and some steamy romance I would give this a PG 15 rating...and maybe older depending on the maturity of the person reading it.<br /><br />These books have stayed with me...and I can't recommend them enough.<br /><br />PG15<br />YA Crossover
B002SJIO5E|4.0|Nice to see aliens sometimes land outside of the US. I was also surprised at how good the special FX were. Very realistic.
B0064NTZJO|1.0|Drive was a big disappointmentfor me. I was looking forward in seeing this movie ever since I viewed the kick ass trailer. But the movie was flat and boring. If you think you are going to see a action film think again. The movie is slow and uneventful. They try and turn this into a love story but the two characters feel unconnected to each other. Trust me I love films that are like nothing you have ever seen and I give them credit for trying something different but it just did not work. Oh well.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|this is the best calendar app I have had. easy to use and easy to configure. well worth the money spent on it.  love it!!!

0525478817|5.0|I tend to be a picky reader and except for my love of all things Stephen King, I tend to read almost exclusively from the non-fiction genre. I fault no one for enjoying other genres, they are just not my thing.<br /><br />My  biggest problem with fiction is that while I know the story is a creation from the mind of a word artist, I want to believe it is real.It has to seem like it could happen. I want to be able to think about the story and see the action going on in my mind. A lot of fiction just fall flat there. The words don't seem like dialogue I would share, and the actions of characters often do not seem like those of anyone I would want to hang out with. Hence, I avoid fake stories.I don't like fake fur, fake eyelashes, or fake emotion either. I want to read a book that matters.<br /><br />The Fault in Ours Stars matters. This story is so real, I could feel it, I could picture it, it surrounded me and it made me cry. This book felt completely authentically written by a teen age girl, and I consider myself an expert on girlness having once been a teen aged girl and now a mother. The two teenagers could have been anyone's son or daughter, and though I am so thankful they were not my children,they were so real, they could have been. I was particularly moved by the parents and their own suffering over the illness of their children, their probable deaths and the heartache only we parents feel when we cannot protect our children. This story is poignant and funny, down to earth and completely enjoyable even when it makes you cry.<br /><br />None of John Green's novels are bad, in fact they are all quite good (though I haven't read Will Grayson, Will Grayson yet), and I mean no insult when I say his books get better, and better each time, but truly, this book is unequivocally his best. It is truly beautiful in its humor, its realism and its pain. I am so glad I read it. I would recommend it to readers of nearly any age because it is everything like real life.<br /><br />On a side note, in an age when young people have some very unrealistic role models- athletes who use steroids, super models who offer impossible body images, celebrities who get married for five minutes or spend more time in rehab than they do their own homes,and politicians who spend more time criticizing each other than they will ever spend on healing our nation. When there is very little encouragement from the world to be yourself, John Green and his brother Hank Green are two men who stand up for all the things that ought to be encouraged. Such as kindness, and being true to yourself, accepting your awesomeness! They are imperfect and successful at what they do. They are outspoken, yet thoughtful, intelligent and weird. Extremely caring about their fans and concerned about the world they live in. I can think of few better role models- they are filled with awesome.people have some very unrealistic role models- athletes who use steroids, super models who offer impossible body images, celebrities who get married for five minutes or spend more time in rehab than they do their own homes,and politicians who spend more time criticizing each other than they will ever spend on healing our nation.

B005V1WZ10|1.0|The title of this review is what the title should have been for the album.  First, the production is crap.  Noisy and unbalanced melodies thrown into a box and shook up is what it sounds like.  When Head left, he took the creativity with him.  Korn needed to reach out to outside entities in order to make an attempt at being fresh and relevant.  Head comes out with \\"Paralyzed\\" and everyones jaw drops in happiness, craving more.  A true Korn fan would let them know that they should hang it up while they can still be viewed as a good band.  It's like a suffering pet that should have been put down but the owners selfishly don't want to let it go.  If they keep on this road, they will retire as a joke.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok If I had to pay for it no but since its free ok. if u like easy games ok.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have loved and used YouVersion on my computer and phone but it is even better on the Amazon Fire. No need to buy and download any Bibles with this app!
B0060FXDCG|5.0|I receive my order on time and was very pleased with the DVD. I would order from this site again
B000FBJG04|5.0|I was fascinated by the HBO miniseries when it first aired in 2001. I had to have the book and am I glad I did. This book is hard to put down and it is a treasred part of my personal library. A good read, no a great read!
159102594X|1.0|There are many positive reviews of this book. Fortunately, the negative reviews make me believe I'm not crazy after all.  There is a fundamental contract between an author and the reader of his or her books: why, when there are so many other ways that I could be spending my time, should I read this book? There needs to be an answer, say, in something for the characters to overcome, or in characters who are interesting, or in the ambience of the novel. Anything, really.  After 500 pages of this first novel in the trilogy, I honestly can't tell you why I'm reading the book, or why I should read the others that follow. There is scarcely any plot. There are hints of something to overcome (the two wars that other reviewers have mentioned). It's not enough. It appears that the author was so impressed with his words that he forgot to tell us why we should read them.  Rothfuss is the other author who committed this sin recently - 540 billion words! Wordsmithed within an inch of their life! I'm so great, you need to read them all!  What a disaster.
0131103628|4.0|I am a college grad student studying Information Security and we do some programming(mostly Java so far) but I wanted to begin learning C before I take classes that require it.  I purchased this book based on the past reviews and the fact that it is written by the father of C.  So far, I've read the first chapter and all I can say is that it is my favorite programming book I have ever read.  It starts out simple(assuming you have some programming background of some kind) and cleanly and easily describes the code and what it does/why it does something.  I know this is a short review but so far I'm addicted to this book(that never happens with a programming book) and I look forward to learning C. In short, pick this up if you want to learn C!
0316113506|5.0|As a lifelong athlete and Infantry officer I can say that I have experienced many of the benefits described in this book. It is well organized and takes you chapter by chapter through multiple neurological and cognitive benefits of regular exercise: which dwarf the cardio vascular and weight maintenance aspects of exercise. Each functional area, academic performance, depression and anxiety, sex hormonal fluctuations, ADHD, and dementia are summarized with the recent medical research studies that have unlocked the neuro-chemical interactions with the various portions of the brain and their systemic beneficial effect on the body. We are neurological predators, designed/evolved for moving great distances to close in for the high speed kill. This book explains the biochemical system that makes this possible and why the balance is restored to our mind and body through regular exercise. Highly recommended reading for those who wish to live long and age gracefully, this who suffer anxiety or depression, and those with ADHD.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The book is a bit long, but the beautiful imagery kept things interesting. I love somewhat magical books that are still set in a real location/time. I especially liked how the 1st-person chapters resolved themselves, so you knew when you were. Loved it from beginning to end.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|many fun and challenging activities. worth the time and energy to install. great way to pass by the time when bored
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this app on all my digital gadgets. I love being able to read my Bible on the go. The choice of reading plans is very nice for staying on track.  For me,the only drawback is that Internet is required and sometimes ours just isn't working. I always.take that as a time to read the physical Bible if available. I enjoy the highlight and note taking capability of this app.
B004FOA84A|4.0|The game was entertaining but not being all that bright found it difficult to figure out.  Kinda would have liked a hint page if needed but overall enjoyable.  Though the ending just seemed very unexpected and confusing. O.o

B0068FZ1C8|1.0|Billy Elliot is a great film.  I am not sure why we here in the USA can't get the special edition of the film that is available in the UK with all the extras.  The UK special edition, while not overflowing with extras, had two documentaries about the musical version, had several deleted scenes with commentary by Daldry, and it also had the option with just watching the musical sequences, again with commentary by Daldry.  Why these sparse few extras couldn't be included on this blu ray is hard to understand.    Another missed opportunity.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I think thhlis game is fun and hilarious and it can get really addicting but I think that is the fun part of it!&lt;3
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Perfect for anyone who loves to be organized and have notes at hand. I have a while screen dedicated to my colornote notes! One for each of the stores I frequent so my lists are just a tap away when I'm there and a list for 'Saturday' with all my to-dos. Thanks for making this free!

B004INNRFK|5.0|Items were sent in a timely manner and were as described. This was a mighty fine company to work with.
B000KIRT6A|5.0|Great value stomp box that does the same job as much more expensive ones. Works well with no noises occuring when switching on and off. Battery change release mechanism is not as impressive as some I've seen involving, as it does, some fiddling with a ball point pen to release a spring pin but it seems to work well enough - I'll only ever be using it with an AC adaptor anyway which leads me to the next point which is the less than optimal positioning of the A/C adaptor socket - it's on the side next to the input socket rather than at the top end. Casing is thick high impact plastic which appears perfectly tough enough but is probably less durable and certainly less substantial than steel although there is easily enough weight and grip (base is \\"rubber\\") to stop it sliding around the floor. Like many equalisers it adds its own brand of colouration or character rather than being entirely neutral - this can be demonstrated by setting it \\"flat\\" and switching it on and off to reveal a small but noticable difference in tone - whether you like the character of an EQ is very much a matter of personal preference but so far I've found it to be very easy to get a good sound with bass guitar and with a little more practice great with clean and distorted guitar too - the key to successful adjustment is that a little movement of the sliders can make a big difference to the sound as the distance between 15db cut and 15db gain is only about 2cm.  Conclusion - I'm generally very glad I bought it - especially so as the cost only required me to stay in for one night to pay for it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love Evernote. It was the first apps I downloaded to my Kindle Fire and it has held everything from work notes to grocery lists.  The format is easy to understand.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Growing up, going to church, we sang songs out of dusty hymnbooks; the chapel full of bored, off-key voices crooning mostly outdated lyrics. As a result, my whole life, I've sought out music that I felt really fed me spiritually. Florence + the Machine's \\"Ceremonials\\" is one of the most spiritually rich and uplifting albums I've ever heard.<br /><br />If the album has a theme, it seems to be the idea of searching and yearning for spiritual freedom. On the album's second, stunning track \\"Shake it Off,\\" Florence sings, \\"I am done with my graceless heart/So tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart/And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back/So shake him off.\\" It's a rapturous, cathartic song that's merely the beginning of an album full of rapturous, cathartic songs.<br /><br />Later, on \\"Leave my Body\\", Florence sings \\"I'm gonna leave my body (moving up to higher ground)/I'm gonna lose my mind (History keeps pulling me down).\\" Like every true spiritual seeker before her, Florence yearns to move past the animal demands of her body, as well as the burdens of human consciousness, in order to find peace and transcendence. And she knows it's easier said than done.<br /><br />The songs on this album, performed with Florence's passionate, powerful, almost operatic voice, and accompanied by epic and haunting arrangements, offer nothing less than a portrait of a human soul's quest for liberation.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|I bought this for my father in law for christmas and he played it right away and loved it. great music.
B0061JPYX2|4.0|It's difficult to write an objective review of \\"Lioness\\". It's hard to not be overly sentimental when discussing what will probably be the final works ever heard of an artist who I thought was extraordinary, and destined for a long, productive career. Despite years as a tabloid train wreck, I truly believed Amy would grow out of her youthful self-destructive phase and go on to make music for decades. It wasn't meant to be.<br /><br />So I will try to judge \\"Lioness\\" on its own merits. \\"Back to Black\\", Amy's last (and sadly, only second) true full-length album offered an ingenious blend of a 1960's Girl Groups sound mixed with contemporary urban beats and language. Since then, others have offered similarly retro pop music (Adele, Duffy, et al) with varying degrees of success, but nobody did it quite like Amy did. She was a true original.<br /><br />On \\"Lioness,\\" the contemporary urban grittiness is, for the most part, less in the spotlight, and most of these songs sound like they were from a bygone era. \\"Tears Dry\\" and \\"Wake Up Alone\\", both demo/alternate versions of songs that ended up on \\"Back to Black\\", sound much more basic and nostalgic. And although it's fascinating that Amy can convincingly duet with both Tony Bennett and Nas, the former collaboration fares much better, with \\"Body and Soul\\" being one of the album's strongest tracks. My favorite song on the album is one of a handful of covers, a heart-rending version of \\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?\\"<br /><br />Overall, \\"Lioness\\" is much more polished and consistent than you might expect it to be. But it's less a full album than it is a eulogy.
B002IVLH60|5.0|I bought this for my mother in law for christmas and she really enjoys it. good music for anyone that likes pearl jam.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|This is a great series. It is definitely for mature audiences. There is blood, guts, torture, and sarcasm. When my stomach was not churning from the vivid descriptions of war and dismemberment, I was laughing quite uncontrollably, at the morbid sarcasm. There are no heroes in this book, only villains. It was quite a refreshing change from the books where there is good and evil and good always wins the day. Since there was no clear line between good and evil, the reader will have to decide if good or evil wins out.
B004EPZ06G|1.0|the movie shipped throughout the movie...not a good Disc  I'm sure the movie was good, if the disc wasn't bad
0307949486|3.0|\\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,\\" was a book I wanted to read before seeing the movie. I was also, curious as to what the story was about. I figured it would be your typical mystery, but a story that set itself apart from other writes. Reading the first few pages I was drawn into the word of Blomkvist and Slalander. However, there are parts of the novel that seem to drag on a bit. The writing is excellently written however, it contains a lot of details--which when you are reading a mystery I believe is necessary.<br /> I agree with other reviews that the story does seem very surprising in certain parts and other parts it did not seem so surprising. I must say that the strongest part of this book is the characters and how they are very complex. You really understand the characters in the book, especially Blomkvist and Slalander. Also, I am skeptical when men try to write women, however Larsson possesses the talent to do so. The ending seemed to go on for awhile with the back plot wrapping itself up and I thought the ending could have been stronger. I still say give this novel a try and I do plan on reading the second novel.

0817439390|5.0|I am very new to DSLR photography; my prior experiece was using a point and shoot camera.  A friend of mine loaned his copy of the book to me to help me understand exposure.  I really enjoyed reading each section as the author's approach has a nice balance of technical information and artistic suggesion.  I liked it so much that I bought my own copy and one additional for another friend of mine who recently bought her first DSLR.  If you are interested in taking nicer pictures or want to get a bit artistic with your shots then I recommend this book.  I suspect that even those beyond the beginner level may learn a thing or two.

0525478817|5.0|John Green does amazing, as always, with his newest book! I've always been a huge fan of them, and since he announced the book on Vlogbrothers, and read the first two chapters, I was hooked. I couldn't wait until I got my signed copy in my hands.  I read the entire book in just a few hours, and then proceeded to read the book again, and again, and again.  This book will take you on an emotional roller coaster. At the end of the book, I felt as if the characters were real, and felt the pain as they went through situations.  GET THIS BOOK.

0312641893|4.0|I am tempted to give five stars to this lovely book.  It defied all of my expectations--though really, maybe that's to be expected just from the ambitious premise.  It's been a long while since I have been completely sucked into a story from the first few pages, but I was unable to put this book down from the beginning.  Let me tell you why.<br /><br />First, the characters.  Cinder as a heroine is just what this book needed.  She is tough, strong in every sense of the word, and very relatable.  As the book summary and gorgeous cover spell out, the Cinderella of this tale is a cyborg, with two metallic appendages along with a few other odds and ends, including a brain interface which connects to a database of information.  Which comes in handy, being that she can, as a mechanic, download basically any blueprint she wants.<br /><br />The story itself is set in New Beijing, a futuristic society with hovercars, AI chips, and a fear of the Lunars, or the citizens of the moon.  I thought that the amount of information about New Beijing itself was very well done; it was incorporated with the action and told sequentially, rather than the all-to-commonly-used info dumping.  I absolutely adored Iko, basically the family robot of Cinder and her step-family, and her \\"defective\\" personality chip.  Let's hope we see much more of her in later books.<br /><br />The Lunars, however, could have used a bit more explaining.  It's assumed we'll get more about them in later installments, but I don't think there was enough information in the first book, since they are introduced as the common enemy--specifically Queen Levana.  But from the New Beijing perspective, it seemed that everyone who lived there was just devoid of any aspect of humanity.  Cinder's stepmother Adri and stepsister Pearl were both (naturally) terrible, but we also get glimpses of their sadness and possible guilt, which makes them much more believable as villains.  I want something more than just villainy from the Lunars.  I am intrigued to read more about them in the next book.<br /><br />Prince Kai was a very believable character as well.  His charm really won me over as a reader as he won over Cinder; much of the story is told from his perspective.  To be honest, I didn't enjoy reading his sections as much as Cinder's, if only because a lot of it was semi-political.  But ultimately, these give the reader a look into his potential as a ruler, and I think he proved himself many times over.<br /><br />I also liked the writing itself.  It was well-balanced with description and action and flowed nicely from start to finish.  I would liken it to Scott Westerfeld's Uglies trilogy (or is a quartet now?).  Both have excellent world building, and characters you can root for.  If I had to pick between the two, however, I would say Cinder is the better character.  I can't say that enough, and I really do think she is what makes this book so incredibly readable.<br /><br />Also, not to give anything away, but the huge \\"twist\\" at the end really wasn't much of one.  I think it's pretty clear by the middle (or even before) what is going to happen.  So if you're a reader who despises predictability, be warned.  This really wouldn't have bothered me, however, if not for the events that followed (or lack thereof).  The main reason I can't give that fifth star is the ending.  It makes me upset when authors write this beautiful, well-developed story, and then feel the need to write a cliffhanger ending to make readers insane until the next installment comes out.  Maybe this wasn't the intent here, but cliffhanger endings have been used far too much lately.  I'm not trying to speak for every reader, but I would want to read the next book just as much (probably more) with a semi-resolved ending, and wouldn't hesitate to give this book the five stars it deserves.ore about them in the next book.  Prince Kai was a very believable character as well.  His charm really won me over as a reader as he won over Cinder; much of the story is told from his perspective.  To be honest, I didn't enjoy reading his sections as much as Cinder's, if only because a lot of it was semi-political.

It makes me upset when authors write this beautiful, well-developed story, and then feel the need to write a cliffhanger ending to make readers insane until the next installment comes out.  Maybe this wasn't the intent here, but cliffhanger endings have been used far too much lately.  I'm not trying to speak for every reader, but I would want to read the next book just as much (probably more) with a semi-resolved ending, and wouldn't hesitate to give this book the five stars it deserves.
B004SDSSFY|3.0|This was one of Amazon's free apps. Great deal. Quality product with, for me, a single downside - it doesn't support the latest Microsoft file types such as .docx and .pptx.  If that is fixed it becomes a 4 star app.  On the plus side -unlike Quick Office Pro 5, it can save to an SD card so for some folks that may be the deciding factor.
B002KGKH5A|5.0|this was a great transaction. Speedy turnover, and got in time for Christmas gift--I ordered it 6 days b4 Christmas, and got it day before.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This toy is hard but fun to play with. When you want to play on your own with no pressure and just to compete with yourself, this is the toy.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|It's been a very long time since a read such a gripping book. I found myself slipping out of the office just to be able to read a few more pages.  I have read several of Jodi Picoult's books and this was one of my absolute favorites. I felt so entwined in the lives and emotions of these characters that I could not wait to finish it but also sad that it was over.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|best time consuming game out there, love the fact that the game is not over in 5 min, although patience is deft required when playing this lol
B005UG542S|2.0|This was my first experience with the 48 hour rental from Amazon. And probably my last, unless I hear that they overhaul the player. $3.99 is a little steep in the age of Netflix, but when you're in the mood for Harry Potter... When I stream things at home from Hulu, Netflix or other sites the quality is great. As the film opened the quality was terrible, pixelated to the point that we could barely see what was happening. We stopped it, exited out and restarted, which helped a great deal. With about a half hour left, the movie froze up. We waited for 5 minutes or so and ended up having to re-start it again and find our place, wait for it to load. And then it would not allow us to use full screen! It just wouldn't! I like Amazon for many things, streaming video is not one of them. My advice - buy movies on DVD from Amazon, stream from Netflix. Oh, FYI, we really enjoyed the movie- as a film despite the stupid proprietory player issues :)
B001ECPJZO|5.0|This product is wonderful for therapy the my son. He's autist and is very visual. I intend to teach it to tie the laces.Now to do laces is very easy! This toy is very educational.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This is a great game.  It teaches strategy, can play a game pretty quickly and even the younger kids can participate.  A little above my 6 year old but my 9 year old totally gets the strategies involved.  Highly recommend.
B004UID2LC|2.0|I had this game for one day and frankly Tubemate is way better and I know you probably thinking I help make it or something, but I didn't at all. I just think it is so much easier to use and I am happy with how it seperates my searches and it has all pf youtubes videos not just a few like this app.
B006C1DH92|5.0|It was free.  Its lots of fun.  Nice change to Fruit Ninja to extend the game a little.  Great occasional time waster.
1455870161|4.0|Will Grayson, Will Grayson is the epic tale of two very different young men named Will Grayson, the ironically named and infinitely fabulous Tiny Cooper, one very gay high school musical, and what happens when they all collide. At times funny and poignant and always honest, this book made me want to laugh, cry, and break out in song.<br /><br />Will Grayson, Will Grayson is told from the point of view of, you guessed it, Will Grayson(s). OWG (Original Will Grayson) lives in Evanston where he goes through life trying his best to 1) Shut Up and B) Not Care. Will's afraid of what might happen to him if he starts caring about things and has decided not to risk it and hides behind a wall of apathy.<br /><br />I admit that I was somewhat frustrated by Will at first. He never wanted to seize the moment or say what was on his mind and he ends up missing out on life. As the story goes on, though, he starts to get some backbone and I really started to like Will. He has a deep seated loyalty to Tiny and cares much more about things than he first lets on.<br /><br />The Other Will Grayson is an angry and depressed teen who is struggling to come to terms with himself. This Will Grayson goes through the most growth in the book and, through the miracle that is Tiny Cooper, learns to open himself up to the possibility of love, or at least, really, really like.<br /><br />And what review of of Will Grayson, Will Grayson would be complete without mentioning Tiny Cooper? Tiny is a big, fabulous force of nature. Like a tornado or a tsunami, he just can't be stopped. Outrageous and often completely self-absorbed, Tiny is infuriating but also extremely kind, generous and lovable. He manages to see the best in people and finds joy in everyday life.<br /><br />Obviously I didn't read the print version of this book but I think I can confidently recommend the audiobook over print. MacLeod Andrews and Nick Podehl are both fantastic readers. They truly brought all of the characters to life and gave a distinct voice to each one (not literally though they did do some actual \\"voices\\" for the characters). There's singing of the music theater variety in this book. A lot of it. Normally I would find this cheesy but it's totally appropriate and awesome in this case. I can't imagine that reading the lyrics to the Tiny Dancer musical can compare to hearing the songs sung out loud at full volume. Andrews and Podehl put their hearts into it and belt out those songs. This is one of those audiobooks that actually made me want to sit in my car in park or drive around the block one more time so I could keep listening.<br /><br />A story about friendship, love and taking chances, Will Grayson, Will Grayson is a must read.though they did do some actual \\"voices\\" for the characters).

B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Its angry birds.  Its fun.  But the novelty has worn off.  Was a great time waster but its day has passed.
1904994679|4.0|We bought this book for our 11 year old daughter who loves to learn about the unusual side of life. We get her one each year. The pictures are great.
B005XQLBU4|2.0|Just too hard for a time waster.  If I wanted to be challenged I would work instead of taking a couple of minutes for a game.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|There's no question about giving this app 5 stars! Its a great, fun, and educational. The other great thing is that its free and if you like this app you will love checkers free too. I have them both and am so glad that I got them! I see no reason that this app deserves anything less than 5 stars!
0062082353|2.0|This book was boring I had a hard time finishing just a bunch of rambling events.The book was poorly put together with the ends of the pages uneven. I would like to sat thank you chris for your service
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this game is really fun for someone of any age and it has a lot of variety in the games too.
0307408833|1.0|I have made four recipes from this book and only one was edible. A cookie recipe turned out complety wrong and only worked when I really modified it, the corn cakes were gluatinous and I will throw them out as they aren't worth trying to swallow. I have been baking for over forty years and have never had such bad luck with recipes. I did follow the recipes to the letter as gluten free and vegan are somewhat new to me. This book is not very helpful if you really want to eat gluten free and vegan.
B00005JM02|5.0|I bought this for my 2 year old daughter to watch on a 5 hour car trip to Grandma's.  She loves this movie, and so do kids of all ages from 1-100.  Everyone who has sat down in our house to watch this (on our daughter's request) who haven't seen it before think it's a really cute movie.  I do a lot of babysitting in my home and all the kids ask to watch it.  If you haven't seen it yet, you should.  You won't be disappointed.
1442419814|3.0|My students love this book ... especially the girls. They devour the series. I finally decided to read it, and I have to say I was sorely disappointed. The story is good. The narrator is likable. But the whole premise is ridiculous. The way to equality is to make everyone pretty? I know it's more than that, but I don't want to spoil the book for anyone reading this review., The whole thing is silly. I wrote a review of Unwind by Neal Schusterman. For the same reason I disliked that, I dislike this. Dystopias should be chilling and, although farfetched, they should seem possible. Also, the writing is brutal. Sorry to all those who enjoyed it, but I was actually cringing in parts. Calling the ugly Uglies and the pretty Pretties is fine, but why call the little ones Littlies? Little doesn't end in an E sound! And Crumblies for the older Pretties? And he couldn't come up with better town names than Uglyville and New Pretty Town? The one truly cool dystopian image Westerfeld created was the idea of the flowers that had become like a plague on the environment and needed to be regularly burned to contain their growth. That is realistic. And a great idea. Otherwise, thumbs down from me, a dystopia-loving adult, but 3 stars for all the kids who read books because of this series. Can't take that away from Mr. Westerfeld. He seems to have captured the imaginations of many a teen girl.
B0068FYZIO|1.0|How can this film NOT be on blu ray? What is the studio waiting for? Let's hope they get the message soon.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I see nothing wrong with this game and the fact that its free makes it all the better! Also, the games start out easy and begin to progress into a bit harder standards.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|If you enjoyed Burlesque you will love this soundtrack. Every song in the movie is on this disk. Cher and Christina are terrific. The music is mostly fast-paced with a few slow songs thrown in. Another great car CD.
B0068RGVMK|5.0|Through the decay in American music, I stumbled upon this band recently and the genre generally. I grew up with prog and concept albums, and it was so refreshing to hear this. I had been burning the groves out on Dark Passion Play for the last few months, turning the bass down a notch because the low end tends to wash the higher frequencies, and the wall between bass and guitar was a bit muddly. Dark Passion Play is a masterpiece, but this is better mixed and equally incredible.  They really took themselves seriously this time. Guitars are clear and distinct from the bass and he gets to stand out especially that retro jazz solo on Slow, Love Slow. That song is mind blowing and Anette brings the goods. I can't picture opera girl singing this one. Its got its symphonic metal, but its new orleans sleaze jazz with brushes on the snare. Really, brushes? In this Century? How clever!!  The Crow, The Owl And The Dove is simply breathtaking and inventive. The whole ablum is. Where they might not go in terms of self-indulgent tangents and solos like Dream Theater, they make up for in song sculpting. A way better approach to artistry.  I'll admit being impressed with conceptual aspects of the music, and lamenting an absence of any catchy hooks, but like any good prog, it takes a few listens to get it, and after 3 times, I can only imagine loving more as I listen to it more.  I noticed that I like the whole album especially the songs others don't. But that's not strange. I don't understand the \\"pop\\" descriptions either by Euro-fans. Really?  I only wish we had \\"pop\\" music like this here in the States. Not since \\"Thick as a Brick\\" in 1971-72, anyway.  Ah! my age is showing, and a wider fan base should follow.  The $9.99 price and quick shipping was nice as well.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|very addictive and lots of fun!! would definitely recommend to any and all. not too difficult to get the hang of.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it, and it keeps the kids entertained :) great for passing time or when your bored! the controls are a bit off but you catch on fast.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Plays well on the Xoom wifi. great time killer. Made it to night 28 on the first run. Easy to play and advance.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this so much it kept me holding my breath so many times but at others had me smiling.  Yet again Nicholas Sparks managed to created another book I couldn't put down!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|These games are pretty fun, and easy time killers for the kids I babysit. They love this game, and are always begging me to let them play on my Kindle Fire.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this app is amazing and all apps that are similar should be 101+16 !!!!!!!!! this is such an entertainment when your bored...I highly reccomend this app:)
B004FOA84A|3.0|not worth paying for. too short and no point to playing again.could not figure out the end for the longest time and when I did not a great ending.
B006FPFTMS|5.0|I originally posted a review about how this doesn't work on Kindle Fire. I contacted Foxit support and they looked into the problem and promptly sent me a new APK which does work. With working version I've got a relatively speedy PDF reader with high image quality and some nice annotation options.
0307474259|2.0|First, I apologize in advance that this review is going to be long, but this is a subject I am passionate about.  I bought this book not because I am obese, but because my husband is and therefore I am always interested in the latest research on nutrition. I did read the whole book, and while I agree with some of what Mr. Taubes says, I think he goes overboard in some respects.  What I agree with is that obesity has increased to epidemic proportions in the US (Duh, but I had to mention it). I also agree that our increasing reliance on processed/prepared foods is a major contributor to this. For sure, avoiding sugars, hydrogenated fats, and processed foods, plus upping your consumption of veggies, is a healthy way to go. You have to read labels and know what is in the food you eat. All of this is sensible, sound advice.  What I don't agree with is the alternative diet Taubes promotes. It is really the Atkins diet in new clothes. Chowing down on the meat, fats, eggs, etc. and avoiding ALL carbohydrates like they're poison is just not balanced. And unbalanced is unhealthy and in the long run just not doable for most people.  Taubes touts the diets of certain peoples, such as the Inuit, which are basically 100% animal sources, as being somehow super-healthy, while ignoring the fact that people eating other diets high in carbs--the traditional Mediterranean and Asian models, for example--are just as healthy and long-lived. And no one ever seems to mention that the potato-based diet of the Incas seems to have served them just fine. Also, busting on exercise is just silly. You need to move to stay in shape. Not work out 3 hours a day, just get some activity, whatever it may be.  As an aside, Taubes' idea that factory workers get obese BECAUSE they are so active is just lame. I've been working physical jobs most of my life, and believe me, factories are not busting at the seams with fatties. At my current place of work, which employs approximately 50 people, there is not one obese person working in the shop. The ones with the weight problems are in the offices, sitting behind desks. Capisce?  And Taubes makes this big issue about how obesity levels were so much lower in the 60s. Well, I grew up then, and I remember how we ate, and it wasn't all meat and no carbs. It was cereal for breakfast, a sandwich and a piece of fruit for lunch, meat with a side of starch and a vegetable for dinner, and either water or milk to drink. The biggest differences were that fast food and sodas were consumed maybe several times a YEAR, not every day, that portion sizes were smaller, and that in general people cooked from scratch rather than slapping a \\"skillet meal\\" from a freezer bag onto the table.  So Taubes' evidence is as unbalanced as the diet he advocates. From my own personal experience (admittedly anecdotal), we could put a huge dent in the obesity problem by lowering our consumption of sugars (and how come nobody ever points out that the massive increase in soda consumption has coincided with the obesity epidemic?) and processed/hydrogenated foods; and we can increase our own good health by favoring an omnivorous diet of whole foods that we cook ourselves. Animal products are certainly part of this strategy, but grains and even the much-maligned potato have their place too.  The conclusion, based on my 49 years of experimenting, is that my mom was right when she said: \\"Eat a little bit of everything and you'll be alright.\\" Too bad that advice doesn't sell diet books. Anyway, Taubes sold his book to me, but I didn't buy what he says.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|This is a fantastic product.  It lets you store legos, transport them, and also play with legos in this confined area and then quickly get them back into their storage.  So it's a really great \\"toy\\".  I can see this is really good for taking on vacation, to grandma's, on the plane (it might be tad big for the plane, if you don't to share some of your seat space), etc.  We really like this!  It does smush really somewhat easily - which my son doesn't seem to care about at all.  In other words, it's not completely rigid.  We've had it for a month, and it's maintained its shape decently well.
B006SVHOL8|1.0|I attempted to watch this movie in HD using a Roku device with wifi connection to high-speed cable internet.  The first attempt loaded in resolution so low it looked like I was watching through frosted glass.  The next four attempts loaded in HD, but the picture was jerky and the sound choppy and cutting out every 1-2 seconds.  It was unwatchable.  I found it interesting that the \\"resolution may  be downgraded to match connection capabilities\\" disclaimer came BEFORE the movie would attempt loading.  How about offering a sample to allow this test BEFORE charging a non-refundable fee?   Using the exact same setup, I was able to watch HD movies from Netflix with no problem.  I will not be giving Amazon Instant Video a try a second time.
0439023521|4.0|The book was very well written and gripped me from the start.  I knew nothing of it except of its wild popularity.  Once I found out what the premise was, I was shocked it was so popular - not the most engaging topics!  However, after getting about halfway through, I couldn't put it down.  It was one of those books where you think you know what's going to happen (but, DO you?) and either way, you can't imagine HOW things will happen.  It's very exciting and certainly makes you want to continue reading the trilogy.
B005DMY2OU|5.0|This book set was a great purchase. My order came quickly and in absolutely pristine condition.  The books themselves are just as fantastic as everybody says they are. I haven't been able to put them down. I definitely recommend getting them.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|So I didn't see this one in theaters because just the concept seemed stupid to me.  Aliens and Cowboys.  Really?  Was Hollywood really this intellectually bankrupt that they were stooping to just putting two random concepts together and hoping they'd get something that the public liked?<br /><br />I like many things that are opposites.  I love zombies, I love Marvel super heroes.  I didn't want to put them together, but unfortunately Marvel did and they got the abomination that is now known as Marvel Zombies.  I love Star Wars, and I love zombies, I NEVER wanted to put them together.  But Joe Scrhreiber did and we got the horrible steaming pile of \\"book\\" that was \\"Death Troopers.\\"<br /><br />So when I saw Aliens and Cowboys I threw my hands up in disgust and refused to pay $10.00 USD to see it in theaters, but when I saw it in the Red Box for $1.00, I figured that it was better than watching re-runs of Storage Wars so I picked it up for the night.<br /><br />***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***<br /><br />Right off the bat this starts out as a bad-ass western, and I haven't seen a good western in years!  So to see how awesome this was starting out was a HUGE surprise and a welcome one!  I also was questioning where the main character got his nifty little bracelet thingy and why he couldn't remember, but honestly I knew those questions would be answered soon so I kept watching.<br /><br />I have NEVER seen Harrison Ford play a bad guy before, but he knocked it out of the park with this performance!  Having him play a cattle baron who is a former war hero in a wild west town was awesome!<br /><br />Then the aliens show up.  I immediately thought, \\"Okay here we go with the campy costumes and lame ships,\\" but again I was wrong!  I was blown away by how good the special effects were, the ships looked awesome!  The explosions were cool, and the idea that something so small as a bracelet taking down these fighter ships was pretty friggin' awesome!<br /><br />So then the ships are snatching up people and taking them back to their base to do god knows what with them.  We never really find out what they are doing with these people other than they are all standing around with some kinda restraints on and they're starring at a giant water balloon looking like zombies.<br /><br />So we find out that the aliens are also taking members of the local Native American tribe and they want to get their family members back too and they're ready to ride off into battle but they need a leader.  Who better to do that then the guy who was Indiana Jones AND Han Solo?  Harrison Ford draws the aliens out and the cowboys and natives do battle with the aliens while the main character goes inside to find and free everyone.<br /><br />We also find out that the aliens are harvesting gold for some reason.  This really bugged me.  What were they using it for?  We're never told.  Seriously, did it have monetary value on their planet?  Was it food?  Was it a fuel source?  Did they need it to build some sort of technology?  Seriously I don't care which, but just pick one and tell the audience.  Like in Avatar, we wanted the ore because it had monetary value and it had technological uses.  Or in Independence Day, the aliens came and wanted our planet cuz theirs was dead and they needed a new place to live.  Or even in Battle:  Los Angeles, the aliens needed water because they used it as a fuel source.  Just a little clarification would be nice.<br /><br />So the movie ends and the alien foundry is blown up and everyone is rescued.  Harrison Ford's character and the main character put aside their differences and our main character rides off into the sunset.<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />There's really very little about this movie I didn't like, just the gold issue and what the humans were being used for.  Other than that this movie rocked!  Go check it out!se to do god knows what with them.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|Truly enjoy this app. Some of the games are easy others took me a while to do. I look forward to unlocking all the games and see what comes next.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|this is a brainless and fun game.  there is not a lot of skill required and is great for those times when you just feel fried.
B0009PAVI2|5.0|The item is well made and provides excellent protection for my filters. The mounting strap on the rear makes it easy to mount to the carry strap of my Click Elite camera backpack. The only criticism is with the double lock of the closure flap. As another reviewer correctly pointed out, the locking buckle and Velcro on the flap is redundant and probably overkill.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|Reasonably priced and fast! Not to mention that it's unlocked so you can over-clock it (something I don't plan to do at this time).<br /><br />I have had no issues with this CPU at all. I highly recommend it!
B004A8ZWVU|5.0|I can't speak for myself, as I haven't watched it yet -I'm sure I'll be coerced to do so sooner or later- but my wife LOVES this movie.  The emphasis is necessary here.  This has knocked [[ASIN:B000YAA68C P.S. I Love You]] from its pinnacle in her ratings (or ravings?).  Anyway, all I can say is she enjoys it and definitively states this as her new favorite movie!
B0063GORYU|5.0|great ap everytime I think I'm done playing I cant help but pick up my phone and play again I love it
B004YF6MHW|4.0|There are a ton of ways to customize this thing! I'll also admit it has more customization then the stock camera.
