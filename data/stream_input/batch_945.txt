0375842209|4.0|This book is many things. \\"Haunting\\" may be an egregiously overused clich&eacute;, but it's difficult to find a better word to describe a book set in Germany during World War II that is narrated by none other than Death himself. People seem to either love or hate this book, and I think most of that has to do with the writing style.  Zusak does things that are generally not done.  Words are spoken about as objects that can slap you in the face or roll to a stop at your feet. Colors come to you through Death's eyes, so the skies may be blue or yellow or brown or white. And beneath it all is a rhythm that grabbed me and pulled me through Liesel's world.<br /><br />\\"Summer came.<br />  For the book thief, everything was going nicely.<br />  For me, the sky was the color of Jews.\\"<br /><br />For me, an interesting aspect of this book is the view of the life of a young German living in poverty in Hitler's Germany. I have read a lot of Holocaust literature, but very little from the German point of view. And there is a good mixture of points of view here.  You have Germans from both sides of the line -- those who would help the Jews, and those who would throw things at the helpers and scream \\"Jew-lover\\". Yet even the screamers have their softer sides.<br /><br />Though the book is about Liesel, the book thief, one of the more interesting characters is Hans, her foster father. He is the one who makes it possible for Liesel to develop the love of books and words that eventually saves her life. He makes it possible for Liesel to love anyone at all, with his patience and compassion.  And he's the subject of one of my favorite descriptions in the entire book:<br /><br />\\"Papa sat with me tonight.  He brought the accordion down and sat close to where Max used to sit.  I often look at his fingers and face when he plays. The accordion breathes.  There are lines on his cheeks.  They look drawn on, and for some reason, when I see them, I want to cry.  It is not for any sadness or pride.  I just like the way they move and change. Sometimes I think my papa is an accordion.  When he looks at me and smiles and breathes, I hear the notes.\\"<br /><br />One of the things that really made this book come alive for me is something that you won't get if you're listening to it on audio, or perhaps even reading the ebook (depending on the format).  At one point, Max, the Jewish man living in Liesel's basement, paints over the pages of his copy of Mein Kampf and writes and illustrates a story for Liesel. In the book you are treated to this story, complete with the faded words of Mein Kampf in the background.  It was something so minor, but so powerful for me.<br /><br />There *are* aspects to the book that are weak.  The whole plot line with the mayor's wife comes off as a little undeveloped, and when Liesel decides to write her own life story, it's rushed through and then forgotten in the rubble. There are a few unanswered questions that I really wish had been answered, but I guess it's those unanswered questions that keep us thinking about a book long after we've closed it.

B002VKE1K2|3.0|= SPOILERS=     This low-budget thriller is occassionally effective, occassionally inane. Most of the film's problems stem from the male character, Micah. It is obvious that the story needs to be propelled, however, his actions often lack the authenticity the film so desperately relies on. Micah quickly becomes a caricature of skepticism and male bravado. He begins, understandably enough, as dismissive of his girlfriend Katie's story of a lifetime of haunting, but as the story goes on, his stubborn refusal to allow her to bring in outside help becomes unrealistic. Even after seeing irrefutable physical evidence of an entity around them, he continues to assert that he should be the one to protect his girlfriend. Even as he continues to profess a form of cynicism, he actively, and against his girlfriend's EXPRESS wishes, attempts to communicate with the entity, predominantly through juvenile taunting and a Ouija board. This Ouija board plot thread is completely pointless as it adds nothing to the story and actually serves to weaken it, as Micah attempts to explain that the 'demon' wants to inexplicably 'warn them'... about itself(?).     The dialogue is mostly improvised, and this fact is sometimes distractingly clear. The ending also leaves a little to be desired, as it resorts to the old 'The killer was never found!' trope to leave the audience's nerves on end as they leave the theater.     With that said, the film is very admirable in its ability to conjure tension and suspense with no latex or CGI beasties. The film has drawn a lot of comparisons to 'The Blair Witch Project' and many are valid. However, I saw 'The Blair Witch Project' a couple of months before it was released widely, and as such, had heard nothing about it. As I sat in the theater, I suspected it was fiction, but was never convinced. I imagine, even if I had heard nothing about 'Paranormal Activity', my disbelief would not have been suspended for nearly as long.
B00275EGWY|1.0|I just returned from a tour in Iraq, working directly with EOD, learning the ins and outs. All I have to say is this movie really pissed me off, watching it with all of my EOD tech buddies around, them pointing out everything that these guys were doing in the movie that was wrong, even I knew that you had to be an idiot just to pull command wire out from the sand...it really was not a fun experience. I mean going out in the streets of baghdad in a hoodie... seriously? These movie really was offensive, me personally going outside the wire almost every day and seeing EOD techs get killed out there and knowing that we really dont do stuff like this, this movie was a big BIG letdown!!

Erik Qualman illustrates this so effectively through his book and YouTube video [...]    If companies want to reach their customers and build brand loyalty they need to embrace the concept of online word of mouth advertising.

B002QB1910|5.0|First let me say, I have NEVER posted a review but felt compelled to do so.  I must say that I agree to disagree most times but people who are saying this CD is lackluster couldn't be more wrong.  Meesh \\"magentamindship\\", you in particular I disagree with the most.  People need to understand that domestic abuse does not define Rihanna nor was it the sole basis for this CD.  Most of the songs weren't even written by her.  So, the fact that people believe this CD has to do with her being battered is just incomprehensible for me.  This woman is from Barbados and anyone who knows any West Indian or Caribbean women already know that they have a certain fire about them.  This CD certainly captures that fire in Rihanna.    Now on to my review....first let me say I am a huge fan of Rihanna's last 2 CDs.  I particularly loved the gritty edge on Good Girl Gone Bad.  Rihanna just turned 21 years old and I believe this was her coming out CD--where she wanted to address some hot topics and she does so in the most METAPHORICALLY TERRIFIC way!  She touches on lost love, taking back her feminine power, turning down lesbian advances and a whole lot more.  This CD tells stories like none other!    No dance grooves?? Says who? Almost every song on the CD has a nice groove tempo, particulary Rude Boy which is one of my favs.  No ballads??  Cold Case Love, Russian Roulette, The Last Song and Stupid in Love satisfy this need for me in a major way.  These songs tell a story, no not necessarily a mushy love story but HER STORY or at least what she portrays...and for me it's very believable.  Cold Case Love, in my opinion, is one of the hottest tracks on the CD!  Listen to the CD...I mean REALLY LISTEN and hear her words and her passion and I know you will appreciate it for the great piece of work it is.      Other great tracks: Rockstar 101, Photographs, Te Amo
B000RZIGVS|5.0|I must say without equivication that I received the best customer service when purchasing Star Trek:  The Next Generation - Complete Series. When I encountered a problem with one disk, it was resloved in just days.     This particular Star Trek should be in every connoiseur's of the science fiction genre. Some of the episodes are fluff but overall fantastic as character development continually develops. I definitely recommend this dvd to anyone.
B001GCUO16|2.0|X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE<br /><br />STARRING: Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, Danny Huston, Will I Am, Taylor Kitsch, Lynn Collins and Ryan Reynolds<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: David Benioff and Skip Woods<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Gavin Hood<br /><br />Rated: PG-13<br />Genre: Science Fiction / Action<br />Release Date: 01 May 2009<br /><br />I'm not going to get into how far this film was from the comic books for two reasons. One is the review would never end and the second is, I don't really care because to me it's a prequel to the three X-Men films; not a comic book. From what I understand, fans of the comic found it to be devastatingly far from the true origin of Wolverine.<br /><br />The film opens with two young boys: James and Victor, growing up in Canada with super powers. Certain events happen and the boys leave home. Then at I guess whatever age the actors are in real life, (Hugh Jackman as James and Liev Schreiber as Victor), they stop aging; for whatever reason, this is never explained. And don't tell me it's disclosed in the comics, because this is not a comic book. It may be a comic-book-movie, but it's a movie nonetheless. And in a movie certain things need to be revealed. A sequel or prequel shouldn't rely on its previous installment alone, to fill in loose holes. Any film should be able to stand on its own.<br /><br />We know that they have stopped aging because as the opening credits roll, we see them fighting in several wars and we end the credit sequence at well over a hundred years from where we began. I guess they were tired of being Canadian because they eventually start fighting in American wars. Maybe they had dual citizenship?<br /><br />They are both in trouble with the military until a man named Stryker (Danny Huston) asks them if they want to join a special team. They join and the team is comprised of way too many super-mutant characters to keep track of.<br /><br />Next for no reason at all, Stryker starts calling James, Logan. I understand this was Wolverine's original name but it is never exposed to us why he is suddenly called Logan. The team becomes corrupt and Logan walks away. Victor isn't pleased.<br /><br />We fast forward six years to learn that Victor is apparently now bad and is murdering off the members of the team. I've seen the film twice now and with the exception of sheer boredom, I can't tell you why he does this.<br /><br />We learn why Logan is going to be called Wolverine and then Victor kills his girlfriend. Having nothing else to live for, Logan agrees to allow Stryker to spend \\"half a billion dollars making him indestructible\\" by injecting him with a special metal. Evidently, for a reason that is again not explained to us, Wolverine is the only one that can handle this painful operation. Then they get mad at each other and Stryker tries to have him killed, just minutes later. I guess the government doesn't audit this guy's allowance.<br /><br />The problem with this being a prequel is that we already know from seeing the first X-Men that at some point Wolverine is going to have to lose his memory. This takes a lot of the suspense out of the film and you won't believe how lame the idea is that they use to justify his memory loss.<br /><br />The thing that bothered me the most in the film was the horrible CGI (Computer Graphic Imagery). I am not generally a fan of CGI anyway. His claws looked like something out of a Looney Tunes cartoon; particularly in the scene of him checking himself out in the bathroom mirror. Last time I checked, technology has improved since the first three films, so what was the problem? The satire-filled commercials with Charles Barkley sprouting Wolverine like claws looked more realistic.<br /><br />There's even a CGI shot of Wolverine driving a motorcycle by the Las Vegas sign. Did they need this shot? If they did then why didn't they just have some no-name stunt guy ride by? The camera was so far away, we wouldn't have known if it was really Jackman or notanyway.<br /><br />There was also a shot of an elderly couple driving and the entire background was CGI. Why? These were two unknown actors. Why couldn't they have shot this sequence on location with any two actors? They clearly had Jackman there, running through the fields. And the elderly couple was only driving down their driveway for crying out loud; it wasn't dangerous!<br /><br />Nearly all of the action sequences looked fake. Wolverine flying through the air and landing on a helicopter looked like something out of a videogame instead of one of the most highly anticipated summer blockbusters.<br /><br />They even used CGI for dust in the motorcycle chase scene and when Wolverine was running through the woods with the helicopter shooting at him. Why? This is one of the most basic tricks in Hollywood, used for years; you set explosives in the ground, then you detonate them and it makes the dirt fly in the air, looking like bullets hitting the ground near the character. The exception would be the final action scene; it wasn't half bad.<br /><br />One of the things in the film that I did like was Hugh Jackman's portrayal as Wolverine. He was clearly born to play this part. He takes it very seriously and does a tremendous job; as he did in the other three films. Watch him in an interview and you will see that this character could not be any farther from the real Hugh Jackman.<br /><br />I also loved Liev Schreiber as the villain. He really got into character here. He is a tremendous actor and I have had my eye on him for years. He should be able to taste an Oscar because he's due one any time.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds was great as always, but only in the film for a few minutes. And at last they put Gambit (Taylor Kitsch) in an X-Men film. I'm not sure if Kitsch was the ultimate choice for the role or not but he was descent. I would have liked to have seen more scenes with him and Wolverine together; but of course they tried to cram all of these other characters into the film who were boring. This movie did not have enough of Wolverine in it.<br /><br />I suspect the film was horribly written. The plot was weak and had too many holes. I don't know how they got these great actors to sign on for this film. Not to directly blame this on the writers, but I was so upset to see my favorite line from the trailer by Wolverine tarnished. It played great on the trailer but in the actual film they add a strong and un-needed swear word. I know Wolverine swears but the line was stronger without it.<br /><br />I obviously wasn't very impressed with the directing of the film either. I feel like the director (Gavin Hood) didn't take this project seriously. I have no idea how he landed this job. According to [...], the only major film he had ever directed was Rendition. How does one go from directing a mediocre film like Rendition, to directing a movie as huge as this? Sadly, Rendition is probably a bit better.y? These were two unknown actors.

0756656230|5.0|I purchased this book for my 8 year old son for Christmas. He is a MAJOR lego fan. He loves reading and getting the Brickmaster catalogs from Lego, plus all of their item catalogs, so I thought a nice book about Legos would suit him well. Although he hasn't recieved the book yet, I am 100% positive he will LOVE it. After the book came and I got a chance to look through it, I am very impressed. Lots of vivid bright pictures of past, present sets...Lots of interesting info. He really enjoys the tiny little details of all of the sets and minifigs,and you get to see them really well. It also comes in a great \\"boxed set\\" with the extra Minifig book. What a great bonus! I know he will really enjoy reading this book. I am excited for him to get it!! I actually would think this book would be more expensive, but it's very reasonably priced for the quality of this book :) And shipping was extremely quick as usual with all of my amazon purchases.
B002RSDW8A|5.0|JULIE & JULIA<br /><br />STARRING: Meryl Streep, Amy Adams, Stanley Tucci, Chris Messina, Jane Lynch and Mary Lynn Rajskub<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Nora Ephron; based on the books: Julie & Julia by Julie Powell; My Life in France by Julia Child and Alex Prud'homme<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Nora Ephron<br /><br />Rated: PG-13<br />Genre: Comedy / Drama<br />Release Date: 07 August 2009<br /><br />Do not, I repeat, do not see this film on an empty stomach! No movie has made me this hungry since Ratatouille. It is filled with the most scrumptious foods one could imagine; everything from a zesty beef stew to a raspberry cream desert. This film was delicious!<br /><br />Although, to call it a film doesn't quite give it the justice it deserves. It's essentially two films in one.<br /><br />Half the film we spend with the legendary Chef Julia Child (Meryl Streep). I am a little rusty on my culinary history I'm afraid, as I had never heard of her. However, I don't have to be familiar with her at all to know that Meryl Streep has nailed, yet another outstanding performance and could very well find herself nominated for an Academy Award for the 16th time. Streep is hilarious, warm-hearted and you can't help but love her in this film.<br /><br />She is married to Paul Child (Stanley Tucci) who is the bread-winner while she begins taking cooking classes. Soon enough she is one of the top students and is cooking up a storm. We follow her over a span of several years in the 1940s in France, as she takes all of her marvelous recipes and inserts them into her masterpiece: Mastering the Art of French Cooking.<br /><br />It's no easy feat to get it published though. She runs into several obstacles along the way, keeping us guessing. Eventually it is a huge success and she is given her very own cooking show.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2002 and we have the second story taking place in Queens, New York. Julie Powell (Amy Adams) is bored with her simple life and wants to do something about it. She decides to take Julia's book containing 524 scrumptious recipes, and generate a blog of her adventures cooking every recipe in just 365 days. She too has her ups and downs with juggling the blog, her long hour day job and her marriage to a man whose patience for her obsession is wearing thin, and understandably so.<br /><br />From there we jump back and forth from the past to the present (2002), showing each woman's journey to success through cooking and writing.<br /><br />From Julia's magnificent kitchen and homes, to Julie's adorable, cozy little apartment atop of a Pizzeria; the film is packed with beautiful sets and spectacular costumes. So much detail went into every aspect in the backgrounds of all the scenes. I have costume design and set design pegged for Oscar nominations.<br /><br />The acting is outstanding. Nora Ephron as always, gets amazing performances out of all of her actors. Adams could see a third Oscar nomination for herself. And may I ask why Hollywood doesn't put Stanley Tucci in more films? The man is incredible. I especially liked the guy playing Julie's husband, Eric (Chris Messina). I had seen him in a few films but not much, and he blew me away. He and Adams had great chemistry together. Jane Lynch surprised me as well. It took me a minute to even realize it was her.<br /><br />And of course there is the wonderful Meryl Streep. While watching this film I realized more than ever how talented she is. Watch how much emotion she conveys with just her eyes. If you take into consideration the fact that Streep knows exactly what her co-stars are going to say because they have rehearsed and rehearsed it God knows how many times; you will me amazed at how she makes you believe that she has heard this new information for the very first time. It never feels like she's acting; it just feels like she is.<br /><br />The film is a perfect blend of comedy and drama. It's not a mushy film by any means but on three different occasions I found myselfwith a little tear in my eye. I find it's more the uplifting successful accomplishments of people that get to me more so than devastation and this film has several little moments like that.<br /><br />Nora Ephron is an amazing writer and director and has made another beautiful film. The only thing keeping Julie & Julia from being absolutely perfect was I simply wanted a little bit more of it. I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.to me more so than devastation and this film has several little moments like that.

0061730327|5.0|I originally purchased this book after watching an interview with \\"The Boy\\" on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart. The story and Jon's reaction to the book made me want to read it. The book covers cultural and historical information that was very interesting. The story gave me a better understanding of a world so different from my own and for which my only exposure had been TV. I would recommend this book.
B0000CF30C|5.0|My feedback for the 5.1 channel SACD version of this classic is glowingly positive. The levels of discrete channel separation and effects do vary from song to song, and I wish the piano in some songs had been relegated to the rear channels, but having said that this album rocks harder than ever! Aerosmith's great song-writing and lyrics are clearly on display and the studio effort during the 5.1 mixing should be applauded. Sweet Emotion never sounded sweeter, nor Big Ten Inch more in your face; No More No More's beginning so crystal clear it sounds live and Round And Round - as you might expect - washes around the room in a dizzying display of the superior effects capable with 5.1 surround. Get this SACD before they're all gone; DVD Audio is already dead and unfortunately SACD may be a walking dead-man as well. Enjoy this superb SACD!
B000069KE0|5.0|I introduced my kids to Make Me Smile and others from a Chicago best of cd.<br />They were playing it so much I decided to revisit the first few double albums and Chicago V.<br />I am enjoying the music so much, all over again.<br />Musically, I've not stayed in that era, but I've always loved that raw sound from that early work.<br />I didnt like the more mainstream and popular hits - that came later in the bands history. As much as I am sure that it provided considerable prosperity for the musicians themselves.<br />For listeners who only know those later tunes they've missed the real best of Chicago.<br />Check out their early work it is worth listening too, for me it must be 40 years of pleasure that I have gained<br />from being a Chicago fan.<br />Jeff Rogers<br />Sydney, Australia
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle has a wonderful voice that lends well to the ballad songs she seems to love (and we love too!). One draw-back to this CD is that Susan hasn't gotten used to fame yet; she falters in spots or her voice shows some nervousness (hey, I'd be nervous too if doing my first CD and knowing it will be heard worldwide!).  The bigger drawback is the backup singers---they MUST lower their sound level and allow Susan's voice to be really heard!    But I love this CD. I bought FOUR of them, 1 for me and 3 for presents.  When Susan makes albums 2, 3, 4, 5... I will be in line to get my copies.    I hope she will take the next year to list every song that she truly loves.  Then, group them into categories and really think about how SHE (not Simon or any producer) wants to arrange HER picks. Then, I think she needs to stand tall and have a heart to heart with the backup singers and orchestra and tell them to tone it down.  And then, Susan, take a great big breath and let us hear YOU!    Still, for a 1st albumn, I give her 5 stars.  I put this on my laptop and laid down for a nap...and it was wonderful to have her voice lull me to sleep! (in a GOOD way!)  (hint-- I think she'd be lovely singing lullabyes for kids, too).    I cry hearing her sing religious songs--- breath-taking voice!     So my last words, BUY this albumn!  It's so refreshing.  We've got too much hip-hop and whatever beating our ears every day... allow Susan Boyle to soothe your jangled nerves, relax your mind and emotions, sweep you into the music and softly release you!  You won't regret this buy.
B00278U1W0|5.0|Awesome disc....concert is around 2 hours 20 minutes. Description on Amazon was over 3 hours, but that includes the extra interview...and during the concert footage, it breaks away for 3-5 minute bites of the interview....and the interview bonus repeats some of the parts seen from the concert footage. The concert itself is fantastic. Clapton is at the top of his game lately, as good as the early Cream days if you ask me. Winwood is very good instrumentally, and it is so great to hear all those Traffic songs, but his voice is off a bit...it's certainly the exception to retain your voice as you age. One thing: most mention the clarity of blu ray...and this disc is sooooo sharp ... (you can see every fingerprint and scratch on Clapton's guitar); but sound wise, blu ray is way better than a regular dvd. I switched back and forth in my blu ray player between this blu ray and The Cream reunion at Royal Albert Hall in 2005 (not blu ray). No comparison....it's like comparing a metal cassette with a cheap non metal cassette (for those of you who remember those days).
B0026P3G12|5.0|I just received Susan Boyle's new cd titled \\"I dreamed a dream\\" and I thought it was one of the most beautiful cd's I have ever listened to.  I wished that I could have just picked up the phone and called her to tell her just how deeply her music touched my heart.  I also thought that her thoughts that were writtened in her writing under each song was a very special touch and what a beautiful tribute to her mother.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|No need to repeat all the laudatory adjectives of other reviewers ... However, one thing should be made clear: ALL the BBC nature series blu ray discs are shot in 1080i, not 1080p...I own Planet Earth, Galapagos, Ganges and Yellowstone...they are all 1080i (it says it right on the back of the package)....Now, does that mean the picture quality is the same as if you were watching an HD broadcast over your cable or satellite signal? NO...it is MUCH sharper! I can see little, if any, difference between these BBC blu ray productions and a true 1080p blu ray disc. I don't know if it is the \\"enhancement\\" process or whatever. I am not an technical engineer for this science. All I do know is that the picture is MUCH sharper than anything you will see over the Discovery channel on your HDTV. All these productions are wonderful! Yet my wife (and kids) totally disagree with me: even though my wife is a true animal lover, she cannot watch these DVDs...she cannot watch the essential need to eat: the need for one animal to kill and eat another animal. These productions are chock full of this natural process of survival. However, if this is a problem for you to watch, here is something you might want to know: Ganges, the series about India, has absolutely NO animals killing other animals for survival. Perhaps that was done because of the Indian reverence for animals.

Of course I am also a big fan of Nightwish, and I really like Marco Hietala's voice. He and Charlotte sound very good together. This album, despite being a \\"project\\" album and their first is excellent. I love every track. I cannot wait until Delain finally gets to tour the US.

I read that David Fincher himself had minimal or no involvement in this transfer, which makes it all the more interesting knowing what kind of perfectionist he is.    But rest assured, this release fulfills on every level. The video is true to the original print, with no apparent grain reduction or edge enhancement that I could detect. Detail in both close-up scenes and background is solid throughout.     Even better than the video is the DTS HD Master Audio track--it buries the original completely. All the old reference scenes such as the mid-air collision, \\"Operation Latte Thunder\\" and car-crash sequences shake the building to its foundations.    Watching this release again on Blu Ray--a film I've watched numerous times--was almost like watching it again for the first time. Truly a must-own item.
B00006DEF9|5.0|Great, happy musical.  Unforgettable Donald O'Connor dance sequence.  Classic Gene Kelley.  Enjoyable premise.
B002NPY7E0|5.0|Film: 5.0/5.0; Video: 4.0/5.0; Audio: 3.5/5.0      Obviously due to Mickey Rourke's well-earned success and critical acclaim with last year's \\"The Wrestler\\", we now receive a fairly expedient release of Alan Parker's \\"Angel Heart\\" on the Blu-Ray format, released on the long-defunct Carolco pictures from 1987.    First off I must mention that I am a big fan of this title. It is not a movie which will appeal to everyone, but I really enjoy the overall visual style and the feel (of impending doom) together with the scenery and the truly awesome music and sound cues which makes this a very original piece, and not in any way reminiscent of a typical 80s film. Coupled with a compelling story based on William Hjortsberg's novel \\"Falling Angel\\" and top-notch performances throughout makes this one well worth watching over again.    Ironically, this movie was released just before Mickey Rourke intensified his self-destructive process (which coincidentally is what makes \\"The Wrestler\\" so good as well, since it parallels Mickey's own strides in life over almost the same period of time covered in that film), a time which--according to his interviews--he was in the process of losing his house (the interviewer actually repeats himself over and over asking Rourke about \\"why he chose to make the film\\"). :)    I don't know if it was this pressure which brought out his performance, but nevertheless it is something to behold--especially near the end where he goes all out and almost loses his voice.     The rest of the cast is excellent as well. Lisa Bonet and Charlotte Rampling offer memorable performances, not mentioning the scene in which Bonet almost got kicked off \\"The Cosby Show\\" for doing. ;)    As for the technical quality of this release, it is quite decent. The film does show its age in certain scenes and background detail, but it is overall quite acceptable. Not much tinkering has been done to make it artificially sharper or \\"smoother\\" using DNR, edge enchancement, et al.The sound (which is afforded a DTS HD Master Audio track) is quite good as well. Obviously the music really benefits (Courtney Pine's saxophones sound glorious). One small negative point is that it has a little muddy bass (which the original DVD also had), and some scenes did not deliver as much punch as I would have wanted to. Other than that, it was given a quite respectable treatment overall.    Dialogue was also intelligible throughout the feature--better so than many newer 90s releases which have made it onto Blu-Ray.    All in all, I can highly recommend this title if you are looking for something a little out of the ordinary. It has quite a few memorable scenes and the performances and music alone makes this a strong buy.    One of Alan Parker's best.     (On an a related note, I see to my horror that this is scheduled for a remake to be released in 2011. Why do these so-called \\"moviemakers\\" always feel the need to subject the most unique & iconic masterpieces to this abhorrent practice? Create something thoughtful & original instead. Oh wait, you're unable to as that would require some ounce of talent. My bad.)
0385341008|4.0|I cannot help judging books by their covers and/or titles. Sometimes that's a bad thing but not with this book. Told in epistolary format, this story is at once touching, historically informative, and entertaining. Sure, it's a light read, but you can tell that as soon as you pick it up. And don't we all need a light read now and then? Recommend this book to your friends who wish they were readers and your mother in law.
B000007MVU|5.0|Just seeing the cover of this takes me back... Back to 1970 when I was 8 years old and a sad little girl with divorced parents whose attention-seeking behavior led me to choose to play the tuba, smoke cigarettes, write tragic poetry and purchase a gigantic button that said \\"I LOVE RINGO\\" - just because I thought no one else did. I wore it all the time. I was already becoming a record collector - but my 45's included The Archie's and the 5th Dimension and LP's being 5 bucks, there was only the Partridge Family and The Monkees. Not a Beatles record in the bunch (I hated the singles played from Let it Be on top 40 radio). But I wore that button and took a lot of ribbing for it - and I suppose I brainwashed myself. So when Ringo released an album I had to have it..    I remember having to ask my mother what \\"sentimental\\" meant. And then those songs...I didn't get it and was disappointed but I had to do the Ringo thing so I listened over and over again alone in my finished basement. I'd never heard these songs or this music before. And being the great songs that they are, I soon knew every word to every song and sang them all the time. My father got a kick out of me singing \\"Bye Bye, Blackbird\\" and I remember being shocked that he knew the words! I sang \\"Stardust\\", \\"Night and Day\\",- all of them. \\"Whispering Grass\\" is probably still one of my favorite songs. I didn't know from \\"The Ink Spots\\".      Today, I am not only a true record collector, but a Juilliard alumn as well. When I stopped teaching I had more time to indulge in the freedom and folly of singing the jazz standards. I know a million of them, but these are the ones I heard first, though until this moment I'd forgotten from whom I learned them. A Beatle gave them to me - its too ironic.     I am now old enough (48) to have a very sentimental response to just the sight this record. Whew! Ringo certainly wasn't a \\"voice\\" and those horns & strings were so weird. So what was once something called \\"sentimental\\" at an age when I hadn't lived long enough to relate to the term, is now \\"a new old memory\\". This is delightful. I thank Ringo for feeding me songs that I only later realized were what are truly and universally known to be \\"cool\\". 'Had I written this review in 1970, it would have been titled \\"Journey Into the Un-cool\\". I would have found 'em eventually, but Ringo served me these standards and it is good to remember...      Who knew that what was once a bunch of weird and old-fashioned songs to me would be at the heart of my current repertoire, not to mention what made me \\"cool\\" among adult jazz musicians when I was too young to know them? I was able to sit in with anyone. Elvis Costello's Almost Blue[[ASIN:B0000009UW Almost Blue]] gave me country standards, and Ringo gave me jazz standards. Go figure...Its been quite a journey!
B000FBFMFW|5.0|I can understand some peoples' reviews that look unfavorably on this book (and the series as a whole) for not having enough combat, adventure and such. This is not that type of series. While there are fights, swordplay, etc., that is not the focus of author.     The twists and turns that the plots take, the unforeseen changes in the situation of the main character, his battles with himself, his abilities and feelings make for a wonderful journey. The reader is given a colorful and well written story that fully embeds you in the world of Fitz. I'm thankful that the author put in chapters of reasonable length for, without them, I would be reading this non-stop!    I will be purchasing the next book in the serious after writing this review and look forward to even more adventure and intrigue!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|The box set is fascinating and a great listen.  Each disk comes with an insert with great notes about how that album came together along with great pictures.  It is almost embarrasing on how much of this great music I had forgotten.  And Amazon's price was the best I found.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Now my kids are into the beatles.  Nice to see the kids singing the old stuff.
0763631205|4.0|I have never liked any of the many Christmas Carol movies, so I was surprised to find that the story itself is so enjoyable in literary form. This specific edition, the 2006 illustrated by P.J. Lynch is gorgeous. I actually ohhed and ahhed upon opening the book. A Christmas Carol is a story with a wonderful message of goodwill to others and keeping the holiday spirit the whole year through. The ultimate Christmas classic that should be shared with the whole family.
0307716988|5.0|I bought this book for my kids, as they were keen to know more about MJ. So for me it was worth it.
B002VLNB1Q|4.0|After a couple weeks of listening to this, I'm ready to admit that I like the album. But I will stand by the argument that he is capable of much better songwriting than we hear on Battle Studies. The funny thing is, that seems to be the way it was intended. You get the idea Mayer got exactly what he was going for here: a straight forward, pleasant tribute to late 70's/80's pop music (You will hear the Fogelberg, Phil Collins, U2, James Taylor, etc). Lyrically it's honest and heartfelt, but not adventurous or particularly creative.     For the last several months, I've been following John on twitter, and it's impossible not to fall in love with him as a personality. This and the sheer brilliance of Continuum set up expectations that were hard to meet...and they haven't. Basically what I'd say is that it's a perfectly enjoyable album and by no means has he lost his edge, but hard to swallow when you know he's capable of magnificent. The cover on the CD, obviously in place to appease his fans on the blues end of things, classic \\"Crossroads\\" is a blast, but entirely popped out and not with the kind of grit Stevie Ray would approve of.     Assassin is a brilliant, gutsy track. But it's no \\"Belief\\" or \\"Vultures\\". \\"Heartbreak Warfare\\" is a full, orchestrated pop song...but it's not \\"I Don't Trust Myself\\"...same with \\"All We Ever Do\\" vs. \\"Slow Dancing...\\", etc. It stands on its own, and comparing it to your other albums you'll realize he's great. But compare it with the standards he set himself, and I think we have better to look forward to.     Key Tracks: Heartbreak Warfare, Half of My Heart, Assassin, Do You Know Me
B000JQUKKU|5.0|This is one of the best Christmas stories ever written, save for THE Christmas story of Christs birth, that is.  Timeless and classic, people can identify pieces of themselves in all of the well rounded characters in this tome.  My family watches these movies every year!!!  I'm the only one, however, who decided to read the book.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|Very poor acting, poor quality totally unbelieveable! I thought it was a spoof movie at first!
1400079179|3.0|This book didn't do it for me like it did alot of people.  I feel it just didn't flow like the other books do.  I found it a struggle to finish, but in direct contrast is \\"Angels and Demons\\".  I decided to give Brown another chance, frankly, because I read the first few pages in the book store and found myself racing to get home to read it.  It seriously captivated me and I usually do not go for this genre.  Love it!
044654146X|5.0|This is a very interesting book on the development of the technological boom in Israel.  While quite a tiny country, it appears to be one where the most start-up companies per citizen (and in fact, even in absolute numbers)are created and where a huge number of patents are filed. The authors are foreign policy expert and are, obviously, very pro Israel but still manage to stay somewhat objective in their assessment of why this has happened over the last 60 years.  What is interesting is their explanation why similar events have not occurred in other countries. What is also interesting is the fact that the Israelo-Arab conflict does not have a major role in the book.  It certainly is in the background and is part of the explanation for the phenomenon that is the major point of the book. The book is very readable and should be requisite in MBA programs.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I have been recommending everyone I know see this film!  It is eye opening, and I don't think you'll ever eat the same way again.  My husband and I always tried eat well and organically, when possible, but now we refuse to eat anything other than organic.  We are in the process of looking for some local organic farmers from whom we can buy our meat and produce directly.  This is an amazing film.
B002RSDW80|1.0|Don't buy this garbage!  Don't waste your money making someone, who is undeserving, a millionaire.  If you're a fan of Julia Child, then go directly to the source and spend your hard earned money on her product.  The US media gave way too much attention to someone who is a narcissistic bloodsucking opportunist.  Then again, in these troubled times, there's nothing better than diverting the public's attention by panem et circenses.  What is very disturbing is that not only did someone, who cooked Julia Child's recipes as millions of women have done for decades, and scammed sick days with pay from the government via the taxpayer while doing so, (No wonder our country is in such financial disorder with government workers doing this and their bosses allowing them to do so!) but she blogged about it with foul language and Julia Child herself did not approve of Mrs. Powell.  And yet, this woman was given massive media attention for simply cooking recipes and blogging in a disrespectful manner.  Simply amazing!  Then again, that's the US media!<br /><br />Not only is this woman offered media attention and massive deals by the media, she is now selling a book about Julia Child and herself, very egotistical to think we even care about her.  And really, we don't.  She is no one except another scammer.  While alive, Julia Child obviously recognized this.  Julia Child worked many years to accomplish what she did, and a year after she dies; this opportunist publishes a book about herself linking herself to Julia Child.  Even the title stinks of self-importance:  Julie and Julia not Julia and Julie.  Just who is the famous person here who worked many, many years?!  Certainly not the unstable Julie who is first depicted in the title?!  That takes extreme nerve since Mrs. Powell has admittedly not completed anything in her life and should have even been fired from her job and also because Mrs. Child herself was not pleased with Mrs. Powell's bloodsucking opportunistic venture!<br /><br />And if Mrs. Child was alive, would she have sued Mrs. Powell or the book publisher for doing so?  It's no coincidence the book was published one year after Mrs. Child's death, and I must stress once again Mrs. Child did not approve of Mrs. Powell or her endeavors.  I wonder if the estate has delved into this matter at all.  In fact, the estate should really check into plagiarism since Mrs. Powell no doubt had to take information directly from Mrs. Child's book and biography in order to create her writing of Mrs. Child's life.  And this obviously was not done with Mrs. Child's assistance or approval.  The publisher should have reprinted Mrs. Child's own work rather than giving another bloodsucker an opportunity to exploit someone else's hard work, and the director should have also not taken the easy way out, and she should have created her screenplay from Mrs. Child's own memoirs keeping Ms. Streep to play the starring role.  Save your money and stop making scammers wealthy!Mrs. Child was alive, would she have sued Mrs. Powell or the book publisher for doing so?

1592332803|5.0|I've been vegetarian for a few years, but just became vegan about 6 months ago.  So far I have been thrilled with this cookbook.  The recipes are easy to understand, and they are supplemented with lots of information and tips on related topics.  For example, there are a few pages covering all the things that may go wrong with yeast breads, and why each might happen.  Also has a great explanations of vegan substitutes for dairy and egg products in baking.  So far, everything I've made from this cook book has turned out very well, and I'm looking forward to trying many more of the recipes.  I've made a few batches of cookies and given them as gifts, and nobody even knows they are vegan.

0810982862|3.0|Decades in the making, this film is to be the pinnacle of James Cameron's career as a filmaker and upon reading the gushing praise from the likes of Peter Jackson and Jon Landau one would expect this book to be at least a bit more extensive. While there are some quite lovely renderings of the finished designs, it does not begin to explain how these images came to be.  Art books from other films show the evolution of the design process. How each finished image came to have it's own unique & individual look. No doubt there are thousands of such renderings. So why not include them here? Did the Na'vi begin life as felines, monkees, owls, or squirrels? I guess we'll never know. At a mere 108 pages this book is one third as large as other books of it's kind. Even books like The Art of Bolt comes in at a repectable 159 pages. I would have thought that given James Cameron has put so much time, energy, & importance into this project he would have been more eager to showcase the efforts of all the artists involved in what may prove to be the most unique motion picture experience in more than a decade.
B000YD7S2Q|5.0|I have found very few Wagner recordings in any format that compare with this Lohengrin.   If we just want the sound, there is the live 1966 Tristan with Boehm, Nilsson and Windgassen. Gotterdammerung with Solti, Nilsson and Windgassen is another top pick. Leinsdorf's   Walkure, remastered on CD, Is still great.   Wagner without Flagstad, Nilsson or Windgassen is not the same, the singers who came after them rarely sing with the same power and security.  On the other hand modern acting in opera is better, except when there is needless added action.    That said, I feel modern singers deserve a break, due to an increase of noise in the world.  In 1960 powerful stereos, leaf blowers, hair dryers, microwave ovens, airconditioners, and lawn tractors were rare.  Refrigerators only had one motor running part time, of course defrost was manual.  I could go on.  The exposure to all this noise diminishes our perception of and ability to hear soft music.  Hearing tests only go up to 6000 or 8000 Hertz so much of the ear damage inflicted is not documented.  I am in the early stages of trying to document our decline in hearing.  To take a long view, noise has been increasing for 300 years, IMO.  Singers could sing with many more vocal colors in the past than they can now, simply by being able to sing softer.      As a listener ages, hearing declines due to noise and other health factors,  It is no wonder that we think so highly of the singers of our past.  We heard them with young ears in a less noisy world.    BACK TO THE REVIEW    Studer as Elsa is stunning.   She is secure in technique and on pitch.  Her ability to register the emotions of Elsa puts her ahead of prior singers.   Frey as Lohengrin is a bit stiff and light voiced, but this is only a small negative.   Tenor voices are the weak link when it comes to power singing.   All the remaining men are superb.   Schneider conducts so well that I am tempted to put him above Furtwaengler, and certainly above Solti by a mile.The chorus is stunning, particularly the men.      Schnaut as Ortrud is where people will divide.  She is mean enough, making for a great contrast with Studer's gentle Elsa.  Unfortunately she goes off pitch.  I gave two of these DVDs to friends and got one strong vote for Schnaut and one strong vote against.  Before they cast their votes I had felt conflicted, and still do.  If you like Klose as Fricka in both the Furtwaenger and Bruno Seidler- Winkler Walkures you might like Schnaut.  If you like Flagstad's  Rheingold Fricka, you probably will hate her.    The staging is magical and fits the mystical setting of the opera.   I don't think Lohengrin can be updated sucessfully, it is fixed in the King Arthur days.  The lighting is superb and tracks the mood of the music perfectly.   This is a great escape back to the year 1000. The sound is excellent in LPCM mode, barring  slight occasional compression.  Bare in mind that this was recorded live in 1990 so the 5.1 is synthetic.  Dynamic range is very wide, so only superb speakers and phones will reveal all the power and detail in the sound.  Don't let the age of this recording concern you.  In my opinion, Bayreuth was ahead in getting the sound right.

0545128285|4.0|This was an entertaining read. It was nice to be back in the world of Harry Potter for a little while, and it definitely makes me want to go back and read the series over again. My one complaint about the book is the fact that it's SUPER short. Given how long the later HP books were, I expected a bit more from Rowling in this book. Overall, the stories were nice, but I wish the book was longer--maybe longer stories or more of them.
B000ZELISO|3.0|This review is difficult because the novel is my favorite in the series. To be fair to the movie producers, this novel is so rich in crucial info from the multiple story lines, it would be impossible to tell them all within the necessary time frame of a single motion picture... which makes it all the more incomprehensible that they would choose to ADD scenes not in the novel! Stupid decision! To leave out the change over of ministers... the relevance of Fenrir Greyback... the attack on Bill (Ron's older brother)... the act of Dumbledore immobilizing Harry, just prior to the end... no they just have Harry skulking underneath like a coward! I don't care that they had Albus tell Harry to do it. No HERO, and that is what Harry is, would just skulk below! These, all these events and more, are simply left out? And why have Greyback in there at all? Nowhere did they even mention his being a werewolf!!! and that he was the reason Remus was turned!!! --- This film is problematic in so many ways but to me, the biggest complaint I have is the almost total lack of COLOUR in the film! This dreadful journey is so depressing with the greys and dingy yellows and off whites and hazy browns... enough already! I almost fell asleep! -- Look, I gave it 3 stars mainly because I did laugh once or twice. Big deal!
B000W7JWUA|4.0|I was really impressed with how fast this came in the mail (the day after i ordered it). We haven't opened it yet to play since it is for Christmas but there's no damage or anything to the box so I'm sure everything is fine.

It was entertaining, educational and useful; more so for anyone living with early Alzheimer's.  It is a perspective from a person living with early Alzheimer and even though it seems so scary at times, it is eye opening.  Enjoy!

B001US29I2|2.0|I bought this for my son, a huge fan of the star wars legos. He was so excited to build it, spent hours putting it together, and then as soon as he started to play with it, the set fell apart multiple times. After attempting to repair it many times, he finally had a melt down and gave up. Highly suggest if you buy this set you build it on a lego platform to help increase stability and avoid crying children.
B00000ICN5|4.0|In the vast world of debut albums, \\"Texas Flood\\" is one that impresses me the most.  Stevie Ray Vaughan had been around the block a few times before recording it, which is obvious from his mastery of the material and his own instrument.  Whether he was the world's best guitarist is purely subjective, so bickering over whether he was better than anyone else is wasting everyone's time, which seems to be a popular male pasttime when it comes to music.  If you love Stevie Ray Vaughan, love him; if you don't, then don't.    As much as I like \\"Texas Flood,\\" it is not my favorite Vaughan album.  My favorite is \\"In Step,\\" which Vaughan recorded about six years later.  My very subjective reason is as follows.  Vaughan's guitar in \\"Texas Flood\\" is recorded such that it stands between my ears and the rest of the band.  There are precious few breaks from this, so the album itself is limited in terms of variation, emotional ambiquity and tenderness - all of which are vital to the blues.      Contrast this with \\"In Step.\\"  Here Vaughan and the band are presented as equal units.  This is evident from the first track, \\"The House is Rockin'\\" in which Vaughan allows his guitar to step back so the bass and percussion can move forward and then recede, move forward and then recede.  There is real dimension here!  To my ears this give-and-take makes \\"In Step\\" a more confident, more expressive album than \\"Texas Flood\\" on nearly every track.    By Jesus, however, what a great debut \\"Texas Flood\\" is.
B002XHN776|4.0|***<br />REVIEW UPDATE: Since originally writing my review, I came across an interview on a major news outlet website. ([...] I believe) I've upped my review a star because I feel that any \\"big\\" rock band who exerts so much effort and energy in connecting with fans deserves some serious recognition. That is an ethic typically witnessed with \\"small\\" rock bands. And I'm not just talking about Twitter, etc. I get the impression that 30STM really wants to make themselves accessible to fans. Cool.<br />***<br /><br />The prior album had a cinematic drama to it which I feel \\"This is War\\" lacks somewhat. Don't get me wrong --these are great rock songs, dynamic and colorful. Much more interesting that most of what's out there. I suppose my expectations were a little high. But I don't quite feel the heart. I keep wondering which song off of \\"This is War\\" would make a great video and I don't quite recognize that quality yet. I listen to lots of different styles of rock, avant garde, metal, punk and so forth. What raises my interest is when I listen to a group in any genre where I feel like it's fresh and interesting. That's what \\"Beautiful Lie\\" did for me --I'm still waiting for \\"This is War\\" to achieve speak to me on that level.<br /><br />(I can't help but think this album reminds me of another group --Thursday. Check 'em out if you haven't already ...)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001RJ0KS0 Common Existence]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000W01228 War All The Time]]

After he saw this movie he knew that the only place he wanted to be was here with me, hoping I hadn't found someone else to love in the meantime since it had been 2 years.  I hadn't and when he walked into the place where I worked sparks flew all over again, we reunited and have been together ever since, married for 20 years.  We both enjoy watching this movie over and over and sharing old memories that kept us tied together even though we were miles apart.

B001F7MSG6|3.0|I was expecting alot out of Hellboy II. The first movie had such a great story line and great characters. This movie seemed like cliche humor with no attempt to even care about production or even acting. Like everyone was in front of the camera at gun point. If there is a third installment, it might as well be played by Nick Nolte and Margaret Cho. They can play either lead; doesnt matter.
B002AT4K9Q|5.0|Great movie, great quality. It's a must own if you like this saga of movies.
1401216676|5.0|This comic book has many, many great features. To begin, it has an excellent writer and illustrator. Moore's probing dialogue is enhanced by a dark, morally ambiguous world of illustrations. Furthermore, this story is incredibly simple. It features several usual characters posed in unique positions that criticize their more traditional mythology. The 'book' is less than 50 pages--less than an hour of reading. Reader will recognize several scenes and themes drawn from this work in the Dark Knight. This book is a great read, and it doesn't demand much of your time. Pick it up.
B000683VI4|5.0|this movie stayed in my mind longer than any scary movie can or ever will. beautifully filmed, amazing actors, there's seriously no flaws in this movie. but if you watch the deleted scenes, i really wish they would've kept the scene where ally tells noah to read her the notebook everyday so she can come back to him. makes my heart cringe. </3

0061719544|5.0|I love Craig on TV, so I HAD to have this book.  I'm glad I bought it, it's quite the insight into how Craig grew up and became the very funny man he is!  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I recommend it highly.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This is one of the best movies to come out in years...It's intelligent, funny, and holds your interest from start to finish...I can't say enough good things about it, and there are no negative things to say about it...Pixar has really outdone themselves with creativity, choice of acting cast for the voices, and overall quality.  I will enjoy watching this movie over and over.
B001FB55M6|1.0|If the following is funny and you like it, then you may like this movie:    ** Warning: Movie Spoiler Ahead **    1) After attending a seminar, Carl (Jim Carrey) decided to try to say \\"YES\\" to everything anybody would say or ask of him, so a homeless person asked him to give him a ride to some where up in the mountain, and asked him for all his money, and Carl said \\"Yes\\", and due to this, his car didn't start and he walked down the mountain to get some gasoline and right there, he met a girl who kept on talking to him and gave him a ride, let him wear her motorbike helmet, and kissed him mouth to mouth after giving him the ride.      2) He somehow ran into this girl again, and they were to meet the next morning, but Carl's friend asked him to go drink energy drinks for an \\"all-nighter\\", so Carl said \\"YES\\" and went, and the next morning, showed up somewhat crazy and the girl liked it, because he is \\"special\\".    3) Carl is a loan officer at a local bank, so he started saying \\"YES\\" to anybody, for any loan at all.  Because of this, the bank's upper management decided he was doing a great job and sent somebody over and asked him to go work at the corporate office instead.    This sounds too much like \\"wishful thinking\\".  In fact, when in elementary school, many of us dared not to say no, and it is only when we grow up, some teachers and friends gave advice that \\"we should not say YES to everybody and for everything, but decide on how we live our life.\\"    Even 10, 15 years ago, you would hear conversation like this:  Tom: \\"He is a great guy!\\"  Michael: \\"No, he is just a Yes Man\\".    If you like Jim Carrey, I recommend checking out Liar Liar, and The Truman Show.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|This movie has been one of my favorites from the time I was a child, and I couldn't wait to own it so I could see it whenever I wanted.  This is one of the best Walt Disney animated classics along with Sleeping Beauty; Bambi; Cinderella; and Pinocchio.  One can't go wrong with an original Walt Disney animated classic.
B002PMV9FG|1.0|HBP was an inspired, almost impossible-to-put-down story. The movie rendition was not compelling, being completely disappointing as a book adaption.  I was appalled that the story was almost completely rewritten, that scenes were completely changed or missing altogether (thus affecting future story lines).  I am not complaining of the typical rewrites that are mandated through necessity, as translating a piece of literature onto film requires amendments. Instead, what I lament is the complete disregard for the story line altogether.  One of the many things that I admire about Rowling's writing is her ability to increase the level of tension and suspense throughout the book. This development of tension was blatantly missing from the movie. In the book the tension begins with the heightened security throughout the wizarding world, no student is left to wander alone and Harry is watched like a hawk. The presence of the Order of the Phoenix was vital to the literary version; however it is barely evident in the movie. In the movie Harry is allowed to wander at will and later he wanders with Ron and Hermione, no member of the Order hovering nearby for their protection.   Of course, the biggest disappointment, as others have mentioned, is the battle between Dumbledore's Army and the Deatheaters. In the book it was the crisis to which all actions were leading. In the movie, this event never occurs. Dumbledore's death wasn't even provided the emphasis it deserved and to rub it in, his funeral never transpires.   Perhaps the storyline was not paramount for the director of the movie, because those seemingly unimportant scenes that add depth and complexity to any story were also excluded. For example, the scenes that take place at The Burrow over Christmas, the interactions between the characters, would have added richness to the film that it lacked. What we get instead is the ninety-second version of the Christmas gathering, with none of the bickering or banter that occurs within families, like Fleur's imitation of Molly's favorite singer, or Ginny's mocking of Fleur behind her back. We really could have used those moments of levity.  I, of course, don't look forward to the wedding in the next film, as apparently Fleur and Bill are nonexistent. This is probably for the best as The Burrow was blown up in this film, an addition of which I can't see any value as it certainly didn't advance plot.  It was bad enough that the cast of characters that we've grown so fond of over the years are noticeably absent (most members of D.A. for starters); the ones we do see get very little screen time. The halls of Hogwarts are now filled with nameless crowd-fillers rather than characters we remember from previous films.  I also deplore that the actors and actresses that have helped to make these HP films so classically British are rarely seen in this film. Dame Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane were barely visible. We got to see Alan Rickman, but not enough, and Mark Williams and Julie Walters were not given sufficient time on screen. I was particularly horrified to see the scene when Ron was in the hospital wing after the accidental poisoning. In that scene there are several of Britain's finest living actors and actresses standing around for little apparent reason except to be upstaged, quite literally, by Jessie Cave playing the role of Lavender Brown. What a waste of great talent.  I could go on to make comments about the monochromatic and unchanging lighting to the \\"Les Misérables\\" look-alike stage settings, perhaps even making a few comments about the \\"phoned-in\\" performances by much of the cast, but I'll leave it here. Suffice it to say that I can't recommend this film if you're expecting to see a favorite book to come to life on the screen. If you like the Harry Potter series, don't buy the DVD. Save your money; go out and buy a good hard copy of the book and enjoy it as it was meant to be enjoyed; read it.

B002Q9VPFM|5.0|I'm not a graphic novel fan, much less did I ever see \\"Watchmen\\" in graphic novel form. However, near the end of this movie it came together in a way that made me think, exceptionally so. This despite some scenes I fast-forwarded thru, and others I wish I had.     To try to synopsize my impressions, the movie presents its characters as \\"familiar foreigners\\", i.e. people who may inform us about ourselves because they are at once so different, yet so similar to ourselves. If I said which character works best for me, I would be giving away much of the plot. Let me just say  \\"Watchmen\\" takes even the most derivative technical effects, and offsets them with characters unique to me. These people are struggling. If you've ever felt suffocated by weeds, rightly or wrongly, you may relate to these characters. Its like that for them.    You'll see a lot of comments on Amazon about \\"The Black Freighter.\\" This didn't work for me, except its animated beginning, and its ending live-action seque. That live-action segue was some of the heaviest for me, and I'm not totally sure why. See what I mean? Nonetheless, the \\"Watchmen\\" soundtrack works very, very well for me, enough to push my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars.     Bottom line for me is, a rough watch, but \\"Watchmen\\" is worth the effort. Everyone involved in making it, helped make it so. I think a lot of work went into this movie, beginning with the makers learning to understand and convey its harsh eloquence. \\"We have never been, and can never be, alone - Anon\\"
B000ZLFALI|1.0|My 13 year old daughter loved it.  I hated it.  Go figure.  I REALLY hope she doesn't expect me to sit through it again.  Loved the music of course, but did not understand the point of the movie at all.  Where was the plot?

I've read a few reviews elsewhere that say there is no growth and it's a bunch of the same (even if that were true, would you complain?).  I don't know what these critics were listening to, though, because this album truly is amazing.  You get the same passion and raw emotion you know and love, but they expanded this album in two significant ways: \\"fan\\" involvement (what other band uses a choir of their fans on tracks throughout their album??  awesome way to honor their following and it brings so much to the sound) and tracks that have a bit of an uplifting, triumphant feel.  You still have the darkness you crave, but some songs really inspire.  Standouts?  Kings and Queens, of course, This is War, 100 Suns, Hurricane, Closer to the Edge, and Vox Populi would be my top choices.  Hmm...that's half the album.  Trust me, it was hard to even narrow it down that much.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed.

0061719544|5.0|If you like Craig Ferguson on The Late Late Show, you will like this book.  His words jump off the page with the same enchanting voice and sometimes painful bluntness.  In many ways, it's astonishing he's still alive and (relatively) sane, considering the life he's lived so far.  Read this book, because it will only increase your enjoyment of this truly amazing man, whom I'm proud to call my fellow American.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|OMG!!! i seriously think that everyone in the world should see this series, if not at least one segment. It is so touching and sensitive to watch, especially ones that focus more on the wildlife than landscape. My friend recommended the version of Planet Earth that did not feature Sigorney Weaver's voice because he said \\"it was annoying\\". All around very inspiring video and entertaining to watch!
B000F5GO0A|3.0|The debut release captures Condon's particular gyp-die style more convincingly when the production and vocal work are not tuned up so much.
0312867123|4.0|I first became interested in this book because of the show. Right off the back, the book jumps off to an amazing start whereby you initially find out who/what causes the blackouts. From then on, the story gets progressively better and then dillutes it with personal side stories from some of the charactes. By the end of the book the focus kinda shifts from a sci-fi genre to a murder mystery. Think of it like a futuristic game of Clue. Although I loved the book, i could've done without some of the chapters which where centered around certain characters/events that barely held my interest. If the tv series' ending follows the same plot as the books, then i would assume some viewers my be caught off gaurd because it would be pretty farfetched. Yet still, I definitely would reccommend this to anyone who is looking for a good sci-fi/mystery novel.
0385504225|5.0|Other great book by Dan Brown. The price of the Hard copy was lower than all stores in town.
B001FB55HQ|3.0|It's hard to know how to rate these releases at times. Do you base it on the movie alone? The DVD/Blu-Ray release? I'll have to do the movie and dvd seperate in this review because the grades are different.    The Theatrical Cut is a decent movie. It feels like T3 (which might not be so good to some of you) in the way that a lot of story feels cut. Sometimes it feels like a scene or two is missing. The story, what little there is of it, makes for a decent movie, but could be so much better. Something tells me that James Cameron would have done so much more, but that's movies these days, little story, lots of CGI. Though I must confess I liked Christian Bale and Sam Worthington. What made it to the movie story-wise was decent, but again could be a lot better. It feels like all sizzle and no steak. I'd have to give the movie a B-    The DVD release is highly disappointing. No EXTRAS! Nothing. Not a trailer, commentary or anything that I'm used to with buying dvds. Unfortunately, it seems you have to get blu-ray or else be left behind. I love movies too much to settle for bare bones dvds like this. I think it is an awful way to treat customers and thst the industry is shooting themselves in the foot. Standard DVD will die it's natural death like VHS and everything else before. Why force it? Why risk turning fans against you when you force an issue by not releasing the standard extras? I just think they should let standard dvd fade away, but this is not an industry that is fan friendly. How many times do they release dvds like this only to release the special edition or whatever so fans have to double-dip or just lose out. This DVD release gets an F- from me. Lowest possible score. Rent it. Don't buy. Wait for some far off future re-release anniversary, special edition, blu-ray, anything but this. The companies involved should feel ashamed at themselves for ripping fans off. But they don't. It's all about the money.
1416550542|5.0|This was the kind of book that facinated me when I was a child, the kind of story that you get lost in. I was thoroughly engrossed in the characters, especially the story of Eliza, the Authoress, who spun fairy tales as her way to cope with the unpleasantness of her life. I loved the mystery in trying to unravel Nell's story of how she came to be abandoned on a passenger ship, with little to identify her and no one who seemed to look for her. The story had an air of Daphne du Maurier, or Mary Stewart, with gothic overtones, and lost relationships. This book was definitely different from others out there today. I kept trying to predict the ending of the story, only to have the author take me in unanticipated direction. The only thing that would have enhanced the story for me would have been more character development in Nell's early adulthood. I would have loved to have heard more about just how Nell was affected by the crushing news that her foster father gave her as a young adult and why there was so much estrangement with her daughter, Lindsay. Maybe that could be another book!

Overall very good: had to watch it two days in a row.

New haircut and image enhancements alone will not lift Jones beyond the snooze queen persona she has milked so successfully so far in her career. Kind of a brunette Dianna Krall, surviving on emotionless breathy vocals, mediocre piano chops, glitzy album covers and media hype. Even standing up and stepping away from the piano bench doesn't raise the energy level.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|This is an excellent cd. It bothers me when a band comes out with a new cd and people say it doesn't sound like their last cd.  It shouldn't sound like their last cd (GOOD GRIEF). Music is suppose to expand with greater heights. One Republic is not afraid to do something different and not lose their style. If you like their last cd, than you will like this one.

0439023491|5.0|This book finds Katniss almost a year later in District 12 living a considerably more comfortable life, that of a victor. Her relationships with Gale and Peeta though has not progressed at all or at least it doesn't for several chapters.<br /><br />Knowing that the Hunger Games are to start up again Katniss and Peeta are thrown back into the camera's eye to both their dismay. For Katniss this is considerably hard, she knows that she will have to pretend to love Peeta where as she loves Gale -- something she still has not told Gale.<br /><br />Everything is to go as planned, but when President Snow, the sick and evil leader of the Capital shows up at Katniss' door she then knows nothing is as it seems. She's correct, President Snow eludes to a uprising in the other Districts and he makes a point to blame Katniss for the rebellion. He tells her that the public believes her behavior in last years Hunger Games to be defiance for the corrupt government rather then her love for Peeta. He threatens her with her families death and Gales if she does not step it up a notch and convince the public that she is just a young naive girl in love. So when the cameras are turned on and Peeta and her are sent around to each of the districts on tour to promote the next Hunger Games her and Peeta do their best to behave like lovers. During this time her and Peeta progress their relationship behind closed doors into a good friendship.<br /><br />Yet, nothing can hide the fact that there is rebellion in the air and after their appearances in the districts is seems as though her attempt to be the puppet of President Snow fails miserably. When her and Peeta return to district 12 she decides that herself and her family should make a run for it. She also knows that she can not leave behind Gale, Peeta, and Haymitch (her couch from the games).<br /><br />She asked Gale if he will run away with her on one of their Sunday hunting trips, he agrees and confesses his love for her, but she can't tell him that she loves him back. She wishes she could, but wants to feel like her family is safe before she can even think about love. When she can not say \\"I love you,\\" to Gale they argue and she admits to him that she knows some of the districts, namely one in particular, is rebelling against the Capital. This is all Gale needs to hear before he runs back into town ready to start his own rebellion in District 12.<br /><br />By the time she gets back herself to find Peeta and discuss escape with him Gale is strung up in the town square by a new Peacekeeper (Capital law enforcer) and is being beaten for pouching . Gale is taken back to Katniss' home where her mother helps bring Gale back to life after the severe beating.<br /><br />As much as she wants to run away, she now realizes she can't do it. Having Gale beaten near to death has made her realize that it is in fact Gale she loves, Gale who she wants to spend the rest of her life with. That she can't pretend to love Peeta, that she can't run from truth and waste away in a life that is not hers. She decides to stay and fight for a overthrow of the government.<br /><br />Unfortunately by the time Gale is back on his feet more Peacekeepers have arrived in District 12, and the whole place starts to feel more and more like a prison camp. Then when it can't get any worse the Hunger Games are announced and President Snow informs the Districts that winners from the past Hunger Games with have to play again. Katniss and Peeta know that this is a death sentence. Again Peeta and Katniss spend a whole lot of time together and get even closer. Its this time that she struggles with the fine line between their friendship and possible love.<br /><br />The rest of the book reads much like the first in this series, they are trained, paraded about, and then thrown into the playing field with 2 victors from each district. What is different is the Capital's population doesn't seem all too pleased this time around. Peeta does his bestto win favor for him and Katniss from the sponsors by saying they were secretly married and that she is pregnant, but it all seems pointless. Once in the game they form a shaky alliance with a young man named Finnick who is remarkably beautiful and athletic. All comes to a head when a underground movement does take hold and all the districts revolt during the last day of the Games.<br /><br />In the end Katniss and Finnick are the only ones to escape to safety when the revolution happens. Peeta who is still alive is captured by President Snow and his whereabouts are unknown at the end of the book. The book is set up for the 3rd and leaves you hanging, just like the first did.<br /><br />Couldn't put it down; read it in two days. Action packed and a tear jerker. The only problem I have with it is the same problem from the first book. Katniss spends a huge amount of time with Peeta and very little with Gale. Her and Peeta kiss and cuddle through out the book and she seems to waver a lot in her feelings for Peeta, does she in fact love him -- you are left to wonder. The few times Gale is in the book its short and usually through memories. So again her love for Gale is lost on me because Peeta's character is so well developed. Not to mention he is just so selfless and kind. How could you not love him. Although, I think we will see a lot more of Gale in the next book just because the writer seems to set it up that way.<br /><br />Can't wait for the 3rd installment!to win favor for him and Katniss from the sponsors by saying they were secretly married and that she is pregnant, but it all seems pointless.

B002DKGWSE|3.0|the revenge is sweet but its a bit violent in the wrong way and the rape scene is something movies should NEVER depict     the subhuman people get some sweet revenge, the garbage disposal and microwave were the highlights of the film. Other than that its extremely violent and not a healthy thing for one to watch.    i saw it twice and probably don't need to watch stuff like that but its a good revenge movie.....and if u like that type of theme the crow is 10 thousand times better and MUCH more action and body count
0691142165|4.0|Let me quote a paragraph from F.A.Hayek's 1944 book \\"The road to serfdom\\", that best explains the concept of \\"This time is different\\" book: \\"Although history never quite repeats itself, and just because no development is inevitable, we can in a measure learn from the pas to avoid a repetition of the same process. One need not be a prophet to be aware of impeding dangers. An accidental combination of experience and interest will often reveal events to one man under aspects which few yet see\\".    Whenever you hear that \\"this time is different\\", \\"we have learned from past mistakes\\", \\"our generation is smarter than the previous one\\", \\"we have better tools\\", \\"previous rules of valuation do not apply\\", \\"we now live in the new era\\", etc., you will see that this time is the same as before. Even If we may have better tools, the willingness to stretch the system beyond limits or disable the steam-valve will also prevail.     The majority of the book is devoted to the worldwide crises that have started in 2007. Although the authors have provided us with the studies of what has happened during the last eight centuries, all that study is a mere illustration that the crisis of 2007 has the same cause as all previous crisis: excessive debt accumulation, both public and private. This is the main idea of this book.    This book is interesting from the economic point of view. However, the authors neglect to take into consideration cultural and behavioral issues, e.g. there is no answer in the book why some countries like Norway or Denmark or Canada have never defaulted on their sovereign debt.    Since, this book is written by the economists, it has lots of terms like \\"GNP\\" or \\"leverage\\" throughout this book. If you are familiar with them, I can recommend \\"The only three questions that count\\" by Ken Fisher, where you will get a contrarian view, and will be able to make your own judgments between the contradicting ideas.    If you like a simple book, I can recommend Crash Proof 2.0 byPeter D. Schiff or Guide to Investing In Gold and Silver by Michael Maloney. Although the title of the latter book is related to precious metals, this book essentially is not about metals but about the history and economics, written in a very friendly tone that even a kid will like.

B002X02V02|4.0|I was literally undergoing mild tension pains waiting for this album to be released. Therefore, when it became available on Amazon, I immediately downloaded it. Having heard poor-quality rips via youtube, I knew that 'Dance in the Dark' when censored used \\"bit\\" instead of the intended word as a result of someone's rather peculiar idea of \\"safely censoring\\" the intended vocabulary (I personally think they might have chosen a less irritating halt-blurt; \\"bit\\" becomes rather annoying after a while). THUS, I had some heads up that I wanted the UNCENSORED version.<br /><br />The day of release, Amazon advertised an \\"Explicit\\" version of the album. I bought it. I was royally peeved. I have a limited budget each payday to buy my music; I'm very careful with it. So yes, when I discovered that I had recieved the unwanted censored versions of 8 individually purchased songs (obviously we have no way of distinguishing censored versus not so from the offered 20 second preview), and thereafter read about the disagreement between Lady Gaga and her record company on the matter, I experienced more than a little aggitation. If the mis-labelling had been averted, I would still have been irritated, but would have waited patiently. As it is, I will not be re-purchasing the music because of their screw-up. No rewards for poor last-minute management in the music industry - not when it comes to money.<br /><br />In regards to the songs, on the other hand: I was thrilled. Lady Gaga's 'Fears' theme adds a fascinating depths to her candied-burlesque lyrics, and turned this collection of diverse and delicious tempos into a \\"trip to the psychological sweets-shop\\" for me.<br /><br />On the subject of sound: 'Telephone,' and 'So Happy I Could Die' are uptempo and catchy, while 'Teeth' was grittier and definitely a divergence in the right direction. The background beat and vaguelly primal calls throughout the song act like auditory \\"meat,\\" backing up the line \\"take a bite of my bad-girl meat\\" in a way that is both believable and edgy. 'Bad Romance,' 'Monster,' and 'Dance in the Dark' are quite moody in terms of their lyrics, but the sound differs from song to song. 'Alejandro' somehow takes cheesy melodrama and turns it into a mix of passive-aggressive daring defiance and spiraling backtrack (for which I give 5 of 5 stars; beautiful!).<br /><br />Unfortunately, while every other song has captured me on one level or another, I did not care for 'Speechless'. I nearly feel as if I should apologize for disliking it, but if the \\"over-the-top-piano-banging\\" sound is NOT your cup of tea, you might like to know that that is precisely what 'Speechless' is. If, however, you adore this style of music (and can forgive my admittedly-biased pseudonym for it), you can know precisely what you're getting. Enjoy it fully and with my blessing!<br /><br />Put simply:<br />Lady Gaga, please-god, keep making music.<br />Music industry, stop screwing with my bank account to benefit your own.vable and edgy.

B00004SA86|3.0|You would think at the price charged there would be more complete descriptions of what to listen for in each symphony but the notes only give some of Mahler' notes to  two  symphonies. I should have  not needed to consult consult another source of for descritions  about what to look for n each symphony. Not recomended for someone who is looking for their first Mahler set. There are also no texts for any of the symphonies
B00005AREQ|5.0|This is a brilliant piece of jazz-rock-funk fusion from the height of the period.     What can you say about Jeff Beck?  He was tapping before Eddie Van Halen, using the blower well before \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\", pioneering psychedlic rock with his first Yardbirds' track \\"Heart Full of Soul\\", using Chet Atkins-style fingerpicking ala Mark Knopfler(Dire Straits)/Lindsay Buckingham(Fleetwood Mac), using the wah pedal in a unique way (different from Clapton/Hendrix) and experimenting with heavy rock sounds (on songs like \\"Plynth, Water Down the Drain\\") before Jimmy Page/Led Zeppelin.  This disc is one of many career highlights whereby Jeff is finding new sounds, putting his playing in different contexts and challenging himself to create something new.    I think the Jeff Beck Group would have been a formidable band for the ages had Rod Stewart and Ron Wood stuck it out just a little bit longer...but each of them went on to create wonderful things anyway, so no harm done.  Rod's voice is classic, Ron Wood does the two-guitar attack very well with Keith Richards & The Rolling Stones-imagine what he and Beck might've done in that vein if given the time.    The highlights for me on THIS album are as follows: Jeff's interpolation of the Beatles' \\"She's A Woman\\" using the blower, the frenetic intensity of \\"Scatterbrain\\" which is vaguely reminiscent of the classical piece \\"Flight of the Bumblebee\\" (but has a crazy time signature like \\"Blue Rondo A La Turk\\" from Dave Brubeck), the feel-good \\"Freeway Jam\\" which is just about the perfect soundtrack for motorin' down the highway, and the funky masterpiece \\"Thelonius\\" (by Stevie Wonder) which is so down and dirty that I believe it is illegal in 10 states.  \\"'Cause We've Ended As Lovers\\" by Wonder is obviously a great ballad also-but it's received heavy airplay over the years and can be found in multiple places now (including the \\"Secret Policeman's Other Ball\\" soundtrack from Amnesty International, the \\"Beckology\\" box, the \\"Best of Beck\\" compilation, \\"Live at Ronnie Scott's\\", etc.).    Enjoy!
B002WTC8RA|5.0|I first heard of this book on NPR's Morning Edition.  What a great book.  You immediately love all the characters and care deeply about what is happening in their lives.  A glimpse of life from an era that affected the world, albeit, a fictional glimpse.  A story for everyone and one that surely won't disappoint.
0061730327|5.0|William Kamkwamba had a hard life in Malawi.  His entire family suffered during the famine of 2002.  He was forced to leave secondary school because his family had to use all their resources to buy food.  He spent his time in the library, and set about improving the conditions of his family by essentially building a windmill from scratch.  This feat changed his life, his family's life and the lives of the people in his village.  It is an African Horatio Alger story, and we need to hear more stories like this.<br />While you will appreciate the intelligence of the writer, his English is not very good, and his writing is choppy.  Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this book.

0307269981|5.0|Intelligent Thriller. Others have given a good plot synopsis so I will skip that.  I bought Book 1(The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo) after reading that the author, a young journalist in Sweden, delivered a trilogy to a publisher and then died before any of the books was published. After Stieg's death, the books have become International Bestsellers.  I enjoyed book 2 even more than book 1 but I would read them in order as the main characters are the same and the stories happen chronologically.  I am looking forward to book 3 which will be published in May, 2010.
076532413X|4.0|I normally wouldn't review something this old, but with the new TV show, Flashforward starring Joseph Fiennes and John Cho on ABC, having premiered earlier this fall it felt timely to go back and look at a book that a lot of viewers of the show don't realize exist. As with any adaptation, and even more so when the book is adapted to a TV show, I often wonder before viewing either the source material or the adaptation how they're going to differ and which one's going to be better or whether they're even going to be comparable. In this case the source and the adaptation are almost completely different.    In the year 2009, physicists Lloyd Simcoe and Theodosius Procopides perform an experiment at CERN in Switzerland. They set the Large Hadron Collider for an experiment that's supposed to produce the Higgs boson, a particle that existed the moment of the big bang but has never been observed. Instead of finding the Higgs boson, though, all humanity blacks out, as well as all electronic recording devices, and consciousness is displaced 21 years into the future for a period of two minutes. Lloyd sees himself in bed with another woman other than his fiance, Michiko. Michiko sees herself sitting at the foot of the bed of a daughter she does not know yet, and Theo sees nothing. Believing themselves to be responsible they seek the reason for the displacement, while Theo seeks to find the reason behind his possible death in the future and prevent it from happening.     Flashforward (the book) takes place mainly in Switzerland on the CERN property, mainly we read about the characters dealing with issues of morality and crises of conscious as well as coming to terms with the futures they see in their flashforwards. It's interesting to see these characters trying to figure out what happened and the scientific processes behind it. But we also see theories of quantum physics which sometimes enter the realm of existentialism, looking into questions of fate versus freewill and questions about whether the future is set or do we have the power to change it. In this way the book is very powerful as the author doesn't always try to answer the questions, but he prefers to throw out the theories and let the reader choose what they believe.    One of the things I really enjoy about Sawyer's writing is the fact that he doesn't spend too much time telling you about the character's surroundings as some authors due (God rest Michael Chrichton, but he can get a little two wordy on describing the trees surrounding a character). His prose is fresh, while not overbearing, and makes for an easy and refreshing read.    One thing that's kind of unfortunate about the book though is at times it can be unintentionally funny. Flashforward was written in 1999 and takes place primarily in 2009 so at times Sawyer makes observations of 2009 that don't quite hit the mark. While the Large Hadron Collider has only been run once but still isn't fully operational (although it's supposed to be operational this month, the book takes place in April). Sawyer also observes that in 2009 glasses are virtually nonexistent because laser surgery is so prevalent and there is no need for glasses. There's many other instances of this, but not enough to make the book unreadable. This is a sci-fi book relying mainly on a type of time travel, so errancies in the facts of that time are only expected and I'm sure we'll see more that will make us laugh when we hit 2030!    I highly recommend giving this book a try, it'll give you a treat of seeing the way the material was originally meant to be before being adapted for the TV show if you happen to enjoy that, or if you're a fan of sci-fi and science you'll find much else to enjoy.    4.5/5
B002QGUFWE|4.0|It took me a quite awhile to climb aboard the Gaga train but now that I've purchased my ticket, I'm cheering in the front seat.  This album is just plain fun.  What I love about Lady Gaga is that she's not afraid to put it all out there.  She doesn't care if she looks less than attractive or puts her body in an awkward position when she performs.  She doesn't even particularly care if anyone approves of what she does.  I think she'd do it anyway, even without an audience.  It's all for the sake of art.  I find that sensibility to be both refreshing and liberating.  Also, I love her creativity and imagination.    Re:  the songs themselves, they're catchy and full of hooks and great dance grooves.  They're the perfect songs for working out.  I've read some of the earlier comments and agree that the lyrics leave much to be desired, however, I don't care.  These songs are infectious and put me in a great frame of mind.  They also tend to stick in my head all day long which can be annoying.  ;-)  Faves:  \\"Just Dance,\\" \\"Paparazzi,\\" \\"Poker Face,\\" \\"Bad Romance.\\"    Strangely, some of these songs are censored which is ridiculous because you can clearly tell what Gaga is saying.  What's the point?    I give this album 4 stars just because I'm not wild about all of the songs.  There is some filler here.  Overall, though, \\"The Fame Monster\\" is a real delight.

B002VPE7AQ|5.0|When Brittany starts her senior year her plans were to reconnect with her boyfriend and her friends, be the best captain of the Pom Poms anyone had ever seen and keep up her appearance of being perfect and having a perfect life.<br />When Alex starts his senior year he expects to not even finish it. Being a member of the Latino Blood gets in the way of school.<br />What they both didn't expect was each other. A gang member and a seemingly perfect girl would never have a chance but is that all they really are?<br /><br />When I started Perfect Chemistry all I wanted was a break from whiny annoying main characters. I just wanted something fun to read. What I got is a book that will probably stay with me for years to come. It was perfect! I would not change a thing. It really is an incredible love story between two unlikely characters.<br />Alex and Brittany's relationship is the ultimate forbidden love story. One a seemingly perfect rich girl the other a poor gang member. But they definitely are more than meets the eye. I found myself thinking what would I do in their shoes. This was such a complex story. Simone Elkeles really did a amazing job.<br /><br />So often in books you get characters that fall flat or that are one dimensional. Not in this one. Alex and Brittany have layers and layers that are revealed as the story progresses. The narration goes back and forth between the two. I think that makes the story so much better. You get to know both of them intimately and not just how one perceives the other. I fell in love with these characters and even days later I'm still thinking about them.<br /><br />The writing is superb. Spot on. And any other positive phrase you can think of. It was not predictable at all. Just when I thought I had things figured out Elkeles throws you a curve ball. I loved that! On the surface this is just a teen romance but it's so much more. There is a great message in the book and it makes you think.<br /><br />I will definitely be reading other books by Elkeles in the future. She has definitely won me over with this amazing book. If you haven't read it yet please do and soon!<br />[...]has definitely won me over with this amazing book. If you haven't read it yet please do and soon!  [...]

B002HWRYJE|5.0|Every time I say I don't like Star War, I don't know anything about Star Trek... in fact, try my best not to watch anything in the Sci-Fi category... I get a combination of dirty looks, incredulous jaw-drops, disbelieving scoffs, well-meaning lectures on the value of such classics that fall mostly on deaf ears.<br /><br />Well... my problems with Sci-Fi are many... and one of them is the inability to make myself watch shows/ movies that were made with old technology... the colors were nasty... the dialogues were many and dull... the camera angles awkward and unappealing... the fashion, the hair... I could go on.<br /><br />When this new Star Trek came out, my husband was chomping at the bit to watch it...  I cringed, I delayed, I denied.<br /><br />Finally, on one cool December night, when we've exhausted all movie options at the local RedBox, we rented Star Trek. The only expectation I had for the night was that it \\"doesn't suck\\".<br /><br />Well, it didn't suck. In fact, it did way better than not sucking.<br /><br />Needless to say, I loved the new interpretation... the new technology and budget that were allowed for the movie (and not the show)... the lively, clever and not over-the-top humor... the chemistry between the cast members... the excellent casting (my husband insisted that I watched enough of the old show to appreciate the casting)... o, and a pet peeve of mine: the actors were pretty to look at (I can't stand ugly people in a movie unless it has a super-compelling storyline!!! Movies are made for escapes... and that's why no one ever dream of being stranded on an island with an ugly person!!!).<br /><br />Having watched the bit on J.J. Abrams and how he's brought this story up-to-date, his very clever camera-shakes, and his infamous love of \\"flares\\" in the filming further deepen my appreciation for this movie.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy to have finally acquainted myself with one of America's movie classics... albeit, in a new way.

B000ZELISO|5.0|I have not understood any of the complaints about this movie since I saw it in Imax. It's very entertaining, and maintains enough of the books' story to be called Harry Potter. I'm just sorry it isn't a couple more hours longer. Kind of like Lord of the Rings - great movies even though they don't really do the books word-for-word.<br /><br />The BD AQ & PQ are perfect.
0385532458|3.0|I am not a hardcore Grisham fan, but I have enjoyed several of his books in the past. This collection of short stories has a common thread that ties them all together - they all occur in Ford County, a small rural community in Tennessee. Each story takes a \\"Grisham\\" turn (for the worse for the characters). Average reading.
B000093FLA|5.0|All I can say about this movie is that the more I view it, the more I enjoy it! Big hint: turn on captions. Otherwise you will likely not understand a lot of the dialog (unless your a pikey!)  This is one of those movies were I can't figure out which character is my favorite (although it might be Brick Top).  Rent it, buy it - just enjoy it!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|As a long time Star Trek fan, I can say for the first time in a long time, they had a great idea and made a great movie. The early years of Captain Kirk, and how he met all of the other characters was truly well done. I enjoyed this at the movies and I enjoyed it at home...

0930289234|5.0|To an artistic mind, this book is genius. Better than genius, even.<br /><br />The words, images, and overall theme tie in together for an amazing cohesive experience. Many beautiful tricks are used to transfer the reader's mind from one image to another, or from one line of dialogue to the next frame. There's not much point in my writing a very long review, so I'm keeping this short. So, in short, this graphic novel is perfect!<br /><br />I have to admit that the art style is very conservative. Not bland, by any means, but it's very clean cut, and flat. The colors used are not over-stylized or anything like that. Think of the art style as being the opposite of Ben Templesmith. Good anatomy, detailed backgrounds, etc.
159562015X|5.0|This is a great book, well written and easy to read and digest. Once read you will want to go online and take the strengths test that is the purpose of the book. However, what is not stated anywhere that I can find in the description of the book is that you can only take the test if you have a NEW and UNUSED access code available only through a NEW book. In the back of the book is a packet that you must cut open to get your access code. It is the author's intention for the packet to prevent the stealing of the access code without the purchase of the book. Unfortunately, it is not a successful method of prevention. Not realizing any of this, i bought my book from an Amazon vendor who listed it in \\"Like New\\" condition. I saved about $2 on the Amazon price. My book does truly look new. It even had the packet in tact and I had to cut it open to reveal the code. However, my entry of the code has been denied because it has already been used by some unscrupulous person who capitalized on my ignorance. Now I have to buy another NEW book in order to take the test I am oh so eager to take. Oh frugal friends, please learn from my mistake and only buy a new book this time!

The AKG phones are lighter and have good sound, but my ears don't fit perfectly in those circular cushions, and they begin to hurt after a while.  The Koss Pro 4AA's have a more elongated space for ears.  (Maybe my ears have gotten bigger as I've progressed through the aging process.)  My personal preference is the sound from the AKG's - they have a better low end than the Pro 4AA's.

0061537969|5.0|At first I was hesitant to read this, simply because of the title. I'm not really into racing or race cars, and I figured it would be boring for me.    Boy was I wrong.    This is quite possibly the best story I have ever read. And I love to read; I've read hundreds of books. Many of them have been well-written, moving stories, but nothing - absolutely nothing -  compares to The Art of Racing in the Rain.    The story is narrated by Enzo, an old dog who is at the end of his life. He has a lot of wisdom about both dogs and humans which he often shares with the reader. He begins by telling us about his desires to become human. After all, he explains, dogs supposedly come back as humans in their second life. This is why Enzo is more prepared to end his life than he is scared. He is ready to become a human, after years of being unable to speak and express significant feelings as he has witnessed his owner and best pal Denny do.    Here is where the racing comes in; Denny is a racecar driver. As I don't want to spoil the story, I will just mention that Enzo goes on to recount his life with Denny and the family they form together. He tells us of all their good times and their woes and as he tells us about his life with Denny the story unfolds into a very deep, involved narrative. It is a story that is at once touching, belly-aching funny, moving, and witty. Using Enzo as the narrator opens up a whole new perspective for us readers and makes for a great reading experience. Because Enzo can't directly speak, he feels restricted, in terms of not being fully involved in his life with Denny. There are certain things he just can't take part in.     One of the things that makes this such a great piece of literature is how well-written it is. It is so well-written, in fact, that I actually reread sentences several times because they were just so well-crafted. Kudos to Garth Stein for writing such a wonderful story. He uses humor very well. Sometimes I cried of laughter. Other times, I cried of happiness or because I could feel Enzo and Denny's pain and hopelessness. Either way, I highly enjoyed it. Clearly Stein knows how to write. He cleverly uses racing as a metaphor throughout the story to convey messages that apply to Enzo and Denny's life (for example how to race in the rain, hence the title). These metaphors are very deep and subtly inserted into the storyline. For example, there will be the story going along and then Stein will have a page or so of this racing metaphor. It may sound strange, but it is neatly folded into the story. It is like an \\"aha\\" moment, where you are reading and you think, wow that's so true, or that makes sense. I really liked this aspect. And here I thought I wouldn't like the racing part. I loved it!  But racing is not the only metaphor used. Stein also uses some other cool metaphors that he weaves throughout the story so that we as the reader feel some consistency. We will see the metaphor pop up once in a while as it relates to the story and its awesome because you're like, oh cool, he did it again! And I couldn't help thinking every time, there's the metaphor again! It worked so well.    But besides being crafty with wording and metaphors, Stein has simply put together a wonderful story. It is one I will always remember and love because I felt like I was going along for the ride. I rooted for Enzo and Denny every time they were down. I wanted them to succeed, and when they did it felt great! Both protagonists were very well-developed to the point where you felt you really knew them.     For me the ending was lovely and a wonderful surprise. Like I said, Stein's ability for writing is amazing. His creativity in the whole story (especially the end) was masterful! He has really written a lovely story full of heart and freshness. This story is so unique; nothing like I have ever read. (Some critics have compared it to Marley and Me and the like. It is a similar premise, but taking Steins talents into consideration, this is much deeper, and I have to say a better story especially since it is fiction you will notice the different tones and feelings in it. Whether or not you liked Marley, give this a go; it's got its own thing going for it).    I highly recommend this story to everyone who appreciates a great piece of literature (and of course if you enjoy racing and/or are a dog-lover you gotta read it!). This is a beautiful story that is not overbearingly heartbreaking. In fact, most of it is a mix of funny and heartwarming, with some subtle family drama (nothing overdone). The only part I cried of sadness was the end (its not what you expect entirely) but the rest were tears of joy, because it really was a happy ending; it really hit home for me. You will just have to pick this up and find out for yourself! Enjoy the ride, it is a great one! And Garth Stein's talent for writing is a huge plus! I promise you will love Enzo and Denny, and their story, just as much as I did.     Good luck trying to put this one down!!
8862930496|5.0|This is the second year that I have decided to keep track of my life with the help of a Moleskine.  I used to have a PDA and I just decided that it is much easier to just jot things down quickly without having to charge, sync etc.  This is a compact book and you have room to write in events and there is a lined sheet for every week to write down phone numbers, shopping lists, comments, memos. If you have ten meetings a day this might not be for you. I have a few children and we are all involved in something and this has worked for us.  You might wonder if it's worth spending the $. I found his to be really sturdy.  I carried my old one around for 18 months usually at the bottom of my bag and it still looks pretty good.
B002MW50KO|5.0|At this writing, the reviews clock in at 81 people loving this album and 80 people hating it. That makes sense: To enjoy this album, you really need to \\"get\\" Bob Dylan.  I'm not being snotty, but let's face it: Dylan's made a career out of faking left while he goes right.  For this one, a traditional Christmas collection is given the rough-and-ready treatment.  It's almost like the town drunk took control of a small town Christmas pageant and led the singers and musicians into a fractured world of holiday glee, sincere yet strangely damaged.  Traditional \\"sweet\\" elements are still on show, but they're backed with Dylan's wheezy croak.  It's reminiscent of some of the things Tom Waits was doing in the early 1980s.  Anyhow, that's my take on this very excellent album.  Of course, for Christmas albums, I also like Tiny Tim's Christmas and Leon Redbone's Christmas Island.  They're both bizarre in their own right, but neither even begins to approach the strangeness of this one.  By the way, one reviewer (who hated the album) boasted that he was a hardcore Dylan fan who \\"even likes half of Self Portrait.\\"  If it tells you anything, I like ALL of Self Portrait, I like all of Under the Red Sky (Dylan's children's album) and even enjoy the bleary and endless covers he and The Band do on the 5-disk Basement Tapes collection.  If my descriptions sounds interesting to you, you'll probably like this album.  If my review makes you think I'm crazy, you probably won't.  So I've either given you a solid recommendation or I've saved you some money.  Merry Christmas!
B0020MKTOS|5.0|Eastwood never gets old.  His view of an older man driven by the prejudices of his politically incorrect generation is an excellent depiction of life in the fifties shoved in the new millineum. Back when each neighborhood nationality had their own ethnic pride and were able to make fun of themselves and their neighbors.  A rare bond between diametrically opposed persons, Walt and Thao are able to breach the walls of radial diversity and look past their own cultural boundaries to understand not only the generation gap but the ethnic gap.  Truely a movie to share with friends, hamily and even strangers.  A wonderful look into the past, present and future.  Realistic violence and language.  [[ASIN:B0020MKTOS Gran Torino (Full-Screen Edition)]]
B002VKE1K2|1.0|the title says it all, i took it from the amazon.com review. Blair witch project was so bad, but this i really think wasnt even half of that movie. My wife wanted to see it cause everyone kept telling here bout all these reviews and how scary its supposed to be; i told her i did not want to waste my time watching this crap movie. Well i gave in cause my brother was even like 'its supposed to be the scariest movie in the last 20 years.\\" Wish i would have stuck with my gut feeling on this one. Theres nothing scary about this movie. period. a few footprints and loud thumps and doors closing. 90% of this movie feels like its being shot in the bedroom with the camera pointed towards the door. Most of the movie is filled with them just talking and going through there day. The end could maybe be freaky at most, but really, it wasnt even anything to write home about. PLease do not waste your time on this movie. If you like blood n guts or any kind of gore stay away. if you like movies like wickerman, cloverfield, and the blair witch project movies then watch this movie you might enjoy. If you hate those movies like i do then save yourself your time and money. If you really want to watch this do it on like redbox where your only out a dollar.
B00000I8UD|5.0|This will not be as immediately appealing as, say, Secrets of the Beehive or Gone to Earth, but I have to give it five stars just because I'm happy to see someone doing music like this. Initially I felt there were only two or three tracks that lived up to the level of those earlier CDs, but this CD has gradually grown on me. It's not a \\"desert island\\" disc in the way that those others are...but who's on a desert island, anyway? The style and tone differ somewhat from the earlier ones in ways that are hard to describe, and the lyrics remain focused on personal issues rather than growing beyond them into more universal statements. In that sense, perhaps it's narrower or more self-involved. But still worthwhile.
0061765236|2.0|There were times when I could not put this book down....and then @ other times, I did not care if I ever picked it up again. The end was very weak. Does anyone know why Emily killed herself??....
B001N1DPDE|4.0|Let me be clear: This knife has impressed me enough to be listed in my top three choices of blades to keep me in meat and shelter when I go primitive.  It is nicely balanced and is exactly what is needed for it's job.    First off, the blade is not 5 1/2inches, it is 5 1/8 inches long.  Second, the blade angle is not 20 degrees, it is 25 degrees.  That being said, I am not giving the knife itself 4 stars, it is the specifications provided here on Amazon with which I take issue.    Right out of the box, the blade had a nice edge.  Of course, after I put the fine Arkansas stone to it, I can shave with it.  The beefy blade means business and I can see that this is more than just a camp knife.  I have read in other reviews that I should keep the blade oiled to protect from rust, but who doesn't do that with a non-stainless blade anyway?  Even with my stainless knives, I always rub them down with an oily cloth after sharpening or any use in the field.  The sheath is well paired to the knife and keeps the knife secure without binding or slowing the draw too much.  The sheath secures the knife in either direction, perfect for righties and lefties alike.  The securing strap closes with a quality snap.  The release tab on the strap is riveted in the middle by a single rivet, allowing it to be rotated to open with either thumb, making ambidextrous carry simple.    I am very pleased with the value of this knife.  Now that I have one of my own, I am going to be ordering more for a few friends of mine.  The price is just that good.  They could charge more for this knife and it would still be worth it (but please don't, K-Bar!).  If you have a friend who is an outdoorsman, in the military or a biker, this would make a great, relatively inexpensive gift that is sure to please.
B000ZELISO|5.0|Unlike some other movies that are based on books, the Harry Potter franchise has done a superb job of adapting to film while keeping to the original storyline, especially given the thickness of the books as the series progresses.  I currently own the Blu-ray boxed set of films 1-5 (and am watching Goblet of Fire as I write this), and absolutely LOVE it.  I have not yet watched my new blu-ray copy of the Half-blood Prince yet (will do so as soon as I finish the Order of the Phoenix), but I did watch a low quality version of it several months ago.  I cannot WAIT to finally view it in high quality HD, and I had no idea that the slipcover would be lenticular, which I absolutely LOVE!  That, along with the BEST price of a new release blu-ray that I have EVER seen ($14.99), especially for a film as popular as this one, as well as the much-anticipated exclusive footage from the Deathly Hallows (which is actually rumored to be a two-parter), not to mention all the other awesome special features, is the reason I give this product a 5-star rating!
B0006IUDXA|5.0|I purchased this for my 17 year old nephew who had seen a few of the episodes on one of the classic tv stations.  He is a little bit of a geek, and finding gifts for him is very difficult.  He LOVES it!  If you were to purchase this for a \\"collectors\\" item, or to watch it for the fine details, you may be dissapointed.  But to purchase it for the great old memories of when you watched the MacGyver series the first time around, it will make you smile.  Yeah, it's corny compared to the tv technology of today, but so what.
B00001OH1S|4.0|I agree with some other review, I wish this was longer, but what is here is really great. Especially Sinnerman, I had never heard the entire song until I purchased the soundtrack.  I am very pleased, of course I just LOVE the movie to begin with !
0891349553|5.0|LOT'S OF TALENT WENT INTO THIS BOOK. Everyone needs to get this book if they are interested in working with clay. Great Book what else can I say ?
0061864153|5.0|Love the book. Photography is GREAT.<br /><br />Was given a 3 week timeline for delivery. Was slightly disappointed that it was delivered the very last day of expected dates. But worth the wait and the price can't be beat.<br />A MUST for any BON JOVI fan!!!!!
B0000CFW87|5.0|This CD is really great. Josh is really good and I gove him a 10 out of 10 raiting!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This review is for the 4 Disc Combo Pack.<br />My children and I saw Up in the theatre not only on a regular screen but also in 3D. I probably preferred the regular viewing since 3D is harder to watch when you already wear glasses.<br /><br />The movie itself is exquisite. It is for the young and old and like all Pixar movies, is done so well we forget that these are animations and not real people.<br /><br />The characters are rich in emotion and personality and the storyline is creative.<br /><br />It is a must see movie for everyone and a great one to watch over and over.<br /><br />The 4 Disc Combo Pack was a great deal for us. We do not currently own a Blu-Ray player but plan on getting one soon. The nice thing about this pack is that we have a DVD disk to use for now and the digital copy that went on my iPod.<br /><br />When we purchased this set, it was less money than just getting the two disk DVD set.
0375826726|5.0|This book is sooooooo good!! This book is way better than the 2ed book by paloni and just as good as the  1st 1. If you liked any of the dragon keepers chronicles books (by donita k paul) then you will love this book!!
B002PMV9FG|1.0|OK, so you can't really make a movie too much like the book, not enought time, etc.  But it feels like they didn't really even try this time.  So many important parts of the book were just completely missing.  I understand cutting out things like the funeral.  This series is really going into a depressing area, and it really doesn't come out of it until the very end.  I think that JKR took a poor path when she darkened the story further than she really needed to.  But this movies bent even further in that direction with pretty much the entire production soaked in sepia toned depression, and the morose tone overshadowing the few remaining exciting parts.  I would not reccommend that anyone buy this movie.  Staring at a wall is less depressing.
B002OHB3CG|2.0|I admit; I didn't have very high expectations for this album but it turned out worse.The first thing that's so absurd is the tracklist.The songs Memories,All I Need, Forgiven, Pale are already almost acoustic on their original versions.Why didn't they choose harder songs so that we could enjoy something different and fresh?I got so bored listening to this abum.  The only good surprise is 'Caged' which is a bold choice for acoustic.'What Have You Done' is also above mediocre.  Only recommended for really hardcore fans,otherwise save your money and buy 'The Heart Of Everything'.
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|Great video of live concert. What a great concert to recrd. The fans were really into The Killers. I have attended two of The Killers concerts, and the video captures the fantastic live feel.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|Let me get the negetive out of the way first!     The Beatle heavy setlist is my first major complaint!     The next complaint is they absolutely butchered the song I'm Down! One of the performances I was looking forward to the most, and they butchered it up by sticking in totally unnecessary footage of the Beatles! The song just never flows because of this. Who's idea was it to chop the song up like that, it was a very bad decision, totally ruined the performance!     I don't hear any autotune, but even if there is, so what! McCartney and his band are in top notch form!     The good on this Live album is very good, I've said many times that this is the best band McCartney has had since Wings in 76, and on this album they prove it once again.     I won't go into every song, just the highlights for me. The biggest surprise for me was the fact that I absolutely love the performance of Sing The Changes. Hearing this song performed live really makes me appreciate how good it is, a very good rocking performance.     Only Mama Knows is just awesome, and Highway rocks just the way I knew it would performed live.     My absolute fave moment of the entire DVD is the absolute hard rocking coda at the end of the song I've Got A Feeling! Anyone that says McCartney doesn't rock just hasn't been listening over the years!     McCartney just rocks out on lead guitar, and the coda could of been a new song all by itself. It's just a smoking hard rocking performance. I kept going back and listening to it over and over!     Day Tripper is another hard rocking treat, McCartney just needs to perform more songs that he's never done before and the new material on this live album is proof of that.     I also like the way they stretch out on the song Paperback Writer, jamming more than usual with it. This band makes McCartney rock harder!     It's also great to see people really appreciating McCartneys post Beatles music, the crowd was really into the new songs!     A very good live album despite the butchering of I'm Down!!
B0028RXXFC|5.0|THE SERIES<br /><br />Rome wasn't built in one day, we all know that and its story can't be told over 2 seasons but this is probably the best we're going to have, audio-visually, for a long time to come. This is an interrupted, extremely ambitious and, eventually, unaffordable HBO project meant to illustrate the process though which an up and coming but flawed - expansionist, aristocrat driven, slave labor dependent - republic morphs into an equally or more so flawed, unsustainable empire. [Hmmm... lessons to learn? Anyone? Anyone?]<br /><br />HBO and the producers of the show should be commended for doing everything in their power to stay as close as artistically possible to the historical record, whatever was available, of the period - and 'Rome' covers Cesar's climb to power and the period shortly thereafter, up to Octavian's triumph and transformation into 'Augustus' - the struggles, the intrigue, the atrocities - and how the events it triggered affected the aristocrats and the plebes, rich and poor, citizens, free men and slaves. The point of view and the storytelling shifts or swings between the history makers - Cesar, his family, Octavian, the aristocrats opposing Cesar - and two more or less ordinary Forrest Gump-like Roman soldiers who find themselves involved with almost everything historians wrote about those years and are also depicted during their more ordinary moments.<br /><br />'Rome' is a feast to the eye, at least in the Blu-ray version that I'm watching. The colors are vibrant and the details on ornaments, wall graffiti, costumes, makeup are as accurate as they come. I would say almost the same about the sounds of Rome but we know so much less about the music of antiquity... Due to obvious budget constraints, camera angles are almost always narrow, focusing on specific buildings or people with the occasional, probably CGI-produced, panoramic shots. And no large, uber-expensive battle scenes but that's okay because the overall story is told well. I don't believe we ever see more than a few dozen humans on any scene but we should admire the director and the camera people even more for their ability to maintain our suspension of disbelief with the limited means at their disposal. Having some of the scenes shot on location - 'Rome' was made in Italy at the Cinecita studios - makes watching even more enjoyable.<br /><br />THE BLU-RAY EDITION<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition excels in every aspect, from packaging to the quality of the actual episodes to the Blu-ray specific extras.<br /><br />The two season's 22 episodes of about one hour each are delivered on 10 discs. They come inside an amazingly beautiful book-like binding with each disc on its own 2-page presentation/display that consists of one picture on the left page and some details on each of the episodes on that specific disc on the right-side page which also holds the disc. There are additional pages that contain titles or some artwork for a total of 30, thick cardboard, full color pages. It's nice that a cloth bookmark was added to help keep track of where one may be with the viewing. The box the book slides in is color-coordinated with the book covers - dark, weathered dried-blood reddish-brown with gold lettering and accents. Simply amazing.<br /><br />Each episode is presented in 1080p, 16:9 screen and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 Surround sound for English and German as well as DTS Digital Surround 2.0 for Spanish, French, Castilian and Polish (voice over). Subtitles are available in dozens on languages.<br /><br />Blu-ray specific extras include the invaluable \\"All Roads Lead to Rome\\" - a historian presents the historical fact as the episodes run, a 'must watch' when 'Rome' is viewed the second time around because the abundance of information would make watching it the first time too distracting. Also Blu-ray specific is 'Bloodlines', another interactive guide that shows and helps us understand the connections between the various Roman families.<br /><br />In addition, 13 of the 22 episodes come with audio commentary alternative sound tracks from the cast and crew - presumably to be listened to on the third watching of the series. There are also a number of the usual 'behind the scenes' and 'how did we make this' featurettes.<br /><br />MY RATING<br /><br />Not surprisingly, I will rate 'Rome' as a 5-star. It's not perfect but it doesn't need to be so to earn its stars - Amazon's five stars mean 'I love it' not 'it's perfect'. And I absolutely love it. In fact, I am going through the second watching now - the one with 'All Roads Lead to Rome' turned on - and I love 'Rome' even more.<br /><br />My only issue is that which earned 'Rome' its MA (mature audiences) rating. I am quite frustrated for not being able to watch 'Rome' with my kids in the same room. I know that some would call it 'butchery' but Blu-ray technology should allow for a 'cleaned', PG-13 version that kids could watch too because I can see how watching a show like this, especially with the historical interactive guide turned on, would make some curious enough to actually read more on the topic.<br /><br />___________________________________________________<br /><br />FAIR WARNING<br /><br />Anyone considering watching 'Rome' in a 'family' setting should be aware that the show is rated TV MA and for good reason. 'Rome' attempts to accurately depict the Rome of 2000 years ago where sexual inhibitions were all but absent, most women were viewed as 'property' and slaves were numerous. You WILL see explicit sex, frontal male nudity and covering your kids eyes won't be enough - consider earplugs or frequent use of the 'mute' button because the sounds of sex are even more explicit than the images. Besides engaging in sex largely for amusement, violence was part of the Roman way of life - torture, gladiator and other arena fights, assassinations were common.

B000H6SXMY|5.0|I've seen many complaints regarding this set...I was also a victim of a faulty set. I did not order from Amazon but from one of the Amazon sellers. I received the set and the corner was damaged, but I knew it was a used set. I waited about 6 months and decided to watch it...the first disc froze and skipped in spots and I could't remove the subtitles, other discs did the same thing. Long story short, I received a Chinese bootleg. Of course the seller was long gone by the time I noticed, Amazon couldn't help me because it was beyond the \\"grace\\" period... I reordered the set from Amazon and every disc played fine. The \\"official\\" set is in a larger box, the graphics on box and the discs were much more vibrant...also the bootleg did not contain the Friends book, so if you received something like I did, return it immediately!! Hopefully this will keep others from getting ripped off!!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and enjoyed it so I decided that when it came out on DVD I was definately going  to purchase this movie.  The price was even better than most of the others I purchase.
B000TKW3E2|5.0|The Atonement soundtrack has such a haunting melody played out in so many variations on each track that it really ties together the piece of work nicely. the staccato typewriter noises mixed in some of the songs were not annoying like some sound effects but pleasently a charming reminder of the movie itself. I would recommend this for most people that like the soundtracks from Meet Joe Black or Fried Green Tomatoes because all these type of scores kind of bring you back to the emotion of watching the movie.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|This is NOTHING at all like the book!  It is terrible!!!    On the other hand if you have never read the book you will probably find this decent but slightly boring.      Basicaly it's not even a good movie by any standards.  It was a total waste of money and I wish that I had never bought it every time I see it on the shelf.
B001KMB6X2|5.0|In a near future, the mercenary Toorop is hired by the powerful criminal Gorsky to bring a woman named Aurora from a Noelite Convent in Central Asia to New York. In return, he would receive a high amount of money and a clear passport. Toorop joins Aurora and her guardian Sister Rebeka and they cross the dangerous Russia chased mercenaries that also want Aurora. Along their journey, Toorop discovers that Aurora has special abilities and once in New York, they see on the news that the Noelite Convent has been just bombed. When Aurora discloses that she is virgin and pregnant of twins, Toorop realizes that there is something dirty behind and Sister Rebeka and he will not be left alive by Gorsky. I really did enjoy this movie. Vin Diesel I think is a very good actor. I hope another comes out.<br /><br />I
1594488843|5.0|Daniel Pink brings us quickly through the last few generations of our world of business and comes up with a new view on what is Motivation.<br /><br />Using concepts like Type A and B personalities, talking about control and carrot and stick motivation as Motivation 2.0, he introduces his view on where Motivation is today.  Taking almost a 360 view of motivation, he gives us a brief history of work, harkening back to the writings of Frederick Taylor.  Then, he takes us to two locations, both universities, where two psychologists focus their studies on motivation.  One in the 40s, one in the last couple of decades.  Our scientist of the 40s was considered a motivation heretic when discussing he issues of intrinsic motivation.  Going against the flow of the time, he was up against names like Skinner and Maslow.<br /><br />The more recent influencer of the concept of intrinsic motivation, starts with a life where he and his family is fleeing war torn Hungary as the Nazi occupation falls apart.  He is seeing the battles between the Russians, Germans and his own people and thinks about what is it that adults can't seem to enjoy life.<br /><br />New concepts of looking for creativity and what it is when someone is really into what they are doing.  I mention going against the flow.....well, the concept of looking at someone when they are in a zone at work, whatever they are best at, a cook, artist, programmer, manager, they are in flow....look at the flow.  I am sure you have felt it when you are hitting on all cylinders.  That is flow.<br /><br />The concepts of Type I and Type X are new, so, Pink shows us type I Motivation 3.0 concepts in todays companies.  An Australian Software company with its FedEx Days where you have 24 hours to deliver a new concept, overnight.  3M where individuals are allowed to time to develop new product, Google, the well understood concept of 20% time.<br /><br />Interesting insights are throughout.  One interesting thing he talks about is where if too much control for rewards and punishment, there may be a temptation for cheating.  The type I environments are more cooperative and people are willing to pull together.<br /><br />I like also, where he evaluates the Baby Boomer Generation coming of age (60) and the Aha moment they are having.  What is being unleashed in their lives as they look at the time they have left.  Many are motivated to do something with their lives where they are having more of an impact.<br /><br />Additions to the book include a Type I Toolkit, that looks at what you can do for business, yourself, schools, children, etc.  He also lists books where there are additional helps to develop your more Type I behavior.  Daniel Pink even gives his email so you can give him more ideas for the Toolkit.<br /><br />A great read, well worth the time.  This is a great book for the entreprenuer, training and HR manager or practioner, someone with a start up idea as well.<br /><br />Highly Recommend.nd punishment, there may be a temptation for cheating.

B00005N6KG|4.0|Sony MDR-W08 Earphones    Pros:    Comfortable. Lightweight. Headband is barely noticeable and keeps the earphones in my ears. Stay in place when I am moving (I tried jumping up and down with them on). Sound is ok. Don't isolate outside noise, which might be desirable. Short cord may be good while you are on the move. They have markings for right/left sides. Don't cost much. I have had these for years, and they still work.    Cons:    Feel cheap. Sound is only ok, with too much bass for me. Not isolating outside noise might not be a good thing. Cord is too short for comfortable use on a computer, and impossibly short for use with a TV. The cord goes to both sides of the earphones, which means it gets caught on everything.    Other thoughts:    These earphones are the only acceptably comfortable headphone/ear bud type device I have used. Ear buds always fall out of my ears, and over-the-ear headphones are uncomfortable for me. However, my primary use for them is on the computer, which is inconvenient due to the very short (only about two feet to the cord split) length.    The sound is not that good, with a lot of unpleasant bass, so you may have to adjust the tone settings on your device. There are also ports on the back; you could try to cover these somehow to reduce the bass. I'm not handy so I haven't tried.    Overall, I like these, or maybe I should say I don't like any other headphones. Plus these didn't cost a lot, which is good if you are not sure if you'll like them. Buying a premium quality set of headphones or ear buds is a gamble. They might sound great, but it doesn't really matter if they are too uncomfortable to wear. Then you are out a lot of cash.     Try these if you can't stand the feeling of other headphones, or if ear buds always fall out of your ears.
B002RSDW80|3.0|Um, I guess if you have never heard of Julia until this movie came out then you probably will not like this movie.  I am 25 and I took my mom out to see this at the theaters because she loved Julias cooking show.  I thought the movie was long and drawn out.  I left with a pounding headache.  My mother on the other hand enjoyed it.  Maybe its the age difference...Not sure, but I did not like this movie at all!
0307266303|5.0|Christopher McDougall has written a very fun read about many different aspects of the running world. His style is entertaining, informative, and motivating. As soon as I finished this book, I wanted to run 15 miles, pour myself a cup of tea, and begin to read it a second time. McDougall tells us that ultimately, running benefits us all physically, mentally, and spiritually.
B00005MP58|5.0|This version most closely follows the book.  It is a pleasure to watch.  The costuming was well done.  I watch this all the time!

1580176941|4.0|When I received my copy of Cookie Craft I loved the book, the hard cover, the illustrations and the styling. It gives comprehensive instructions and nice tips on how to create wonderful looking and tasting cookies no matter your previous level of experience in baking. I have to say however that it is targeted to US readers and it does not consider that some materials are not readily available to other countries. I think the book would be complete if it provided a table of substitutes. Therefore the 4 stars.
B002QEXN2K|4.0|To pass this album off as merely a retrenchment of his earlier works would be a mistake. Mayer clearly demonstrates his expansive range of musical genres coupled with his excellent song writing ability. While I would agree with another reviewer, that this album does not measure up to his last release, its better than many give it credit for. I think you really need to understand the depths of John Mayer as an artist before writing this album off. His art is a compilation of deep soulful tracks, coupled with an individualistic excellence, that sets each album by itself. John Mayer to me is like an actor that can perform both dramas, and comedies, with equal ease, and success, and this album further adds to the thesis that he is more than just another musical artist. In an industry filled with music that is devoid of meaning or substance, Mayer gives us something to think about that is beyond ourselves. His work is both complicated and simplistic, meant to be both enjoyed and reflected upon. Battle Studies, I believe will be seen as a great triumph of John Mayers development as an artist, and a possible pivot point for his work. The tracks are more bluesy , the depth of their meaning is esoteric in nature, and the guitar work compliments the songs well.     Overall, as with all of Mayers works, its as if you are reading a chapter of his diary. Deep, soulful, thought provoking, very enjoyable. I gave it four stars and not five because I feel it could have been better. I will remain hopeful for his next release. But on the whole 4 stars!
156895963X|5.0|Anyone who has an interest into the struggle of the Irish nation ought to read this book.  I never knew much about it, although I know that extreme poverty was a reason for so many Irish people to leave their homeland for America.  But I never realized how bad the situation was.  I became aware of this book when I read in the newspaper that Frank McCourt had died and I read his obituary. The book was available at Amazon in a large print which was extremely important to me.
B00156ZXR8|5.0|Every Mars fan already know about the songs on the album so there's no need to go into further details on that (other than this edition also features a acoustic performance of Was It A Dream) but this Japanese version of the album also features a DVD disc with all the 6 music videos they had done at the time. So not only do you get The Kill, From Yesterday and A Beautiful Lie, the three amazing videos directed by Jared Leto himself, as well as Attack as the videos released from this album, but you also get the videos for Capricorn and Edge of the Earth from the first self-titled album, and that makes this edition worth every penny!  Should be noted that although it's a longer version of The Kill, it's not the director's cut as the part with Shannon, Tomo and Matt talking was removed. You do however get the full-length video for From Yesterday, although a censured version.
B002TZS5GU|4.0|Usually when a distributor dumps a movie into a handful of theaters with little to no screenings, it usually winds up being a dreadful waste.  Not so with Carriers, which winds up being a surprisingly taut, and incredibly bleak, take on the whole pandemic outbreak theme.  Written and directed by the Pastor brothers, Carriers revolves around a group of survivors (Lou Taylor Pucci, Chris Pine, Piper Perabo, and Emily VanCamp) traversing the hazardous land and following a set of rules that is helping keep them alive.  A chance encounter with a stranded motorist (Law & Order: SVU and Oz vet Christopher Meloni) begins to change all that however, as things start to go from bad to worse for everyone involved.  One may think that Carriers is all about zombies and such just by viewing the trailer alone, but it isn't, yet it still manages to leave a mark upon the viewer as an engaging, albeit slow-moving, horror/thriller.  The surprising standout here is Pine, hot off the success of playing Captain Kirk in Star Trek, who gives a just plain fantastic performance.  All in all, Carriers may not be the 28 Days Later-style zombie thriller that you may be expecting (like I was), but that aside, it is wholeheartedly worth your time.
B000B8QG4A|1.0|My 2 disk 50th anniversary edition was only only a one disk silk screened copy of the movie, but my daugher loved the movie so much we had to keep it. Please be wary of this seller before buying their products.
0671646788|5.0|I first heard of this book from Eben Pagan while going through his program \\"Wake Up Productive\\". I've read a number of self help books from Tony Robbins, Keith Harrell and on and on. . . This book is without a doubt in my top three for best self help books. I sell a lot of books after I read them. This one I have no intention of ever selling. Its that good. I'm sure I'll read it a couple of times over the next couple of years.
B0026J8LHM|5.0|I recently saw Dream Theater live in Melbourne Australia.  They are without a doubt the best band I have ever seen live.  After the set I had a greater appreciation of Black Clouds and Silver Linings.  They opened the concert with A Nightmare to Remember which has to be one of the best opening songs then they closed with The Count of Tuscany.  While these were definite highlights of the live gig, songs such as Wither, The Best of Times and A Rite to Passage are equally as good on this album.  Each band member is near the peak of talent for their respective instrument and are each fantastic to listen to.      This is possibly the best album they have released, which is great when so many bands that have been together for as long as Dream Theater tend to become repetitious and stale.  I can't wait for future album releases, and also hope they continue to release covers of the diversity and quality of the 6 that are also on this album.    Fans should also try and get the EP version of Wither, with the demos versions of Wither (sung by John Petrucci) and The Best of Times (sung by Mike Portnoy).
B000WEMH3C|2.0|This grill cover did not last long.  It tore after about 1 month and the tear has grown.  Spend the extra money on the premium quality.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This is one of the best Pixar films made and that's saying a lot coming the year after Wall-E.  The 4-disc blu-ray brings tons of features and having a DVD and electronic version are handy when you don't have a Blu-Ray player around.
B002XHN776|5.0|30STM first CD was decent and I liked a few of the songs but found the lasting affect no where to be found. This Is War has taken their music to another level and I was knocked off my feet by the effort that you can clearly see went into this, simply by listening to it. Most every song is 5 or 6 minutes and few songs on the CD are sub par. Definitely will jump very close to my number 1 album of the year and I can see my self listening to this for a long time. Also FYI the production is really great on this CD, but not over done, so definitely try to give it a spin on a really high quality stereo system or some really good headphones.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Brilliant!  Susan is so versatile in her singing, there are several singing styles on this CD; get this CD or sample the songs on the CD at the Amazon site. Again, I say brilliant, and \\"good on ya\\" Susan.  Best wishes,  Sarah
0316044695|5.0|...and I don't care, because this story needs to be read, and re-read, by everyone in this country. I became aware of the incredible men of SEAL Team 10 through Crossfit, a fitness organization that named workouts after the brave men that sacrificed everything during operation Redwing. Hero, warrior, soldier - all words that are overused in our current lexicon. Not in this case. Every one of these men, including the lone survivor, author Marcus Luttrell, are heroic beyond most people's range of comprehension. This is one of the single most engaging stories I have EVER read, which probably explains why I have to buy it several times a year, knowing that I'll never get it back once I lend it out, and that's just fine by me. I read a passage from the book to a group of 12th grade students in my homeroom that \\"didn't know why they had to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance.\\" One chapter later, everybody standing - every day. That's the power of this story.
B00004U45G|5.0|I am an unashamed die heard Led Zeppelin fan.  Robert Plant is supposed to be irreplaceable.  So I was pleasantly surprised and rapt to hear Chris Robinson singing Led Zep songs.  I don't think they were trying to be replicas of Led Zep, however, with Jimmy Page at the helm, the arrangements were always going to be extremely similar to the originals.  Chris has pulled off the singing of the songs with aplomb and highlights just how good a singer he is.  The Black Crowes is a tight band here and provides greater depth to these collection of songs with the additional guitar in these arrangements than some of the originals.    Jimmy Page is perhaps playing some of the best solos since the Led Zep days.   The highlights on this album are Ten Years Gone, Heartbreaker, Out On The Tiles, In My Time Of Dying and a version of an old Peter Green (Fleetwood Mac) song \\"Oh Well\\".    This album is a must have for both Led Zep and Black Crowe fans.
B002BSHWUU|4.0|Come on, it's the Beatles!!!  If you're a true music lover, it's a must.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|I want to address anyone that believes that this album is a \\"step back\\" for Mayer. If you have been a JM fan for several years, like I have been (8 1/2 to be exact), you should know that he does not strive to do the same things over and over. He tries to reinvent himself without losing sight of his passion. So, to say this album is a step back is a huge misconception. Yes, this album is different from \\"Continuum\\", but that is what it is meant to be. I mean, if an artist put out the same thing on every album, why buy more than one, right?   I bought this album before it was released through John Mayer's website. I was pleased to receive it the day before it was actually released. I instantly fell in love with half of the songs on the album. Track 2 \\"All We Ever Do is Say Goodbye\\" is so beautifully written. My favorite line...\\"I love you more than songs can say, but I can't keep running after yesterday\\". Track 1, Heartbreak Warfare, is also a favorite. I'll be honest, I am no music critic. But, I can tell you that I am very passionate about music. John Mayer has a way of expressing himself unlike many people in the world. He is one of the most talented and awe inspiring artists I have come across. His music and lyrics will touch your soul. I highly recommend not just this album, but any of Mayer's albums. I own them all.   To end, if you are into the Twitter scene, I also recommend following John. He is so witty and amusing. I guarantee he will give you a laugh. (Please note, not all of his tweets are appropriate for all ages. And you need not follow if easily offended.) You will be pleasantly surprised to find him so funny. Most people think he is very reserved. :)
B0000TG9E2|5.0|My daughters are 3 and 4 and love tea parties they watch this movie over and over again. Thank you
B000ZECQ08|1.0|I know that it is impossible to translate a full blown novel into a two or three hour movie but come on.... It should be at least kind of close to the original story line and this one just doesn't cut it. As a stand alone movie it would be OK, if somewhat too slow, but as part of the Harry Potter series? There's not much here to justify that claim and quite a lot that simply does not belong. Each movie has drifted farther from the books than the previous but this one jumped completely away from the story line and frankly I don't see any way the final movie can get closer without remaking this one first. A real disappointment to me.
B0029LHW68|4.0|I bought this CD at the December 3rd concert in Houston. The band signed it and I was pretty happy to finally get the CD a week early. Got in the car to listen to it on the way home and at first I wasn't sure if I liked it or not. After listening to it a bit over the next few days it began to grow on me. It really is an evolution for the better. Some lyrics are kinda creepy but the other than that I would recommend this album. Hurricane, This War, Kings and Queens, and Closer to the Edge were the best songs in my opinion. Buy it and enjoy it!
B002MW50KO|4.0|As I waited for my CD to be shipped from Amazon, I decided to read some reviews of Christmas in the Heart in anticipation. Got the CD yesterday, and you people are insane. This is Bob Dylan, and these are Christmas songs. He sounds no different than he has over the last 10-15 years, and this is simply a fun new twist on the same old Christmas tunes we've heard year after year. In fact it does have that \\"throw-back\\" sound and theme to it which makes it all the better. The only drawback I found was that there may have been 1 or 2 blips where his voice comes off as \\"over-gravelly\\" on some of the slower, more religious tunes, but this did not damper my overall impression of the CD whatsoever. Must Be Santa i do agree is a highlight. Some of you people reviewing here sound as if you are waiting for the second coming of \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\". Well, it ain't coming. This is just Bob Dylan singing Christmas songs for a charitable cause. And its just a cool record.
B00168OIOE|5.0|These Pixar animated movies look absolutely stunning in HD. Even my wife who wouldn't tell the difference between rabbit ears and HD cable commented on how amazing the picture looked in this film. Bravo!
B00003CXB4|5.0|My husband and I saw Lion King when when we were younger with our kid siblings, and of course as they say, it was an instant classic.  Flash forward 15 years later and I am the mother of three toddlers who have just been introduced to Simba and his pals and they absolutely love it.  I am so glad I bought this DVD.  Even though this movie is in the vault, I found it used, but in great condition.  I defeintely reccomend the Lion King to everyone, no matter what your age.  Enjoy!
B001QOGYB8|4.0|My family and I saw FANTASTIC MR. FOX on Thanksgiving, one of the busiest movie-going evenings of the year.  We were in a group of about 30 folks watching this film...a sad statement.  It's one of the wittiest (not just funny, but witty) animated films in a long time, and a truly original piece of filmmaking.  When movies like PLANET 51 or ...CHANCE OF MEATBALLS can make 5 times as much at the box office, I can only bemoan how many people have caused their kids (and themselves) to miss out on the experience of seeing how challenging films can be, and how much FUN that can be.    Director Wes Anderson is one of my favorite filmmakers.  I know there are MANY people who agree, and MANY MORE who disagree fairly vehemently.  For everyone who loved DARJEELING LIMITED, many more found it inert, pretentious, boring or unemotional.  Ditto ROYAL TENNANBAUMS.  Double ditto LIFE AQUATIC.  I admit, Anderson can be a bit \\"clever\\" in his style.  He films everything from a lower than usual angle.  His camera either sits still or moves side to side...seldom in and out.  He keeps us at a distance this way...much like his characters tend to be emotionally distant or shut off.  The humor in his scripts is often dry and laced with sadness.  When his characters to express their emotional sides, it comes in short bursts that demonstrates a form of being stunted.  His characters are super smart, and very unwise.      Yet in FANTASTIC MR. FOX, even Anderson's critics are finding much to love.  The same filmmaking style is there, but there is also something charming about the way in which he trains his camera on these awkwardly animated figures.  They are frequently filmed at \\"odd\\" angles, but what this does is allow us to SEE more of the character than we might in a more traditionally framed movie.  His reduced depth-of-field works even better with animation...particularly animation this \\"crude.\\"  (It isn't really crude, don't freak out.)    Adapted from the Roahld Dahl story, MR. FOX follows its title character...a dashing, daring young scoundrel of a fox who gives up his dangerous life of chicken-thieving and living on the edge in order to settle down with the love of his life and have a family.  Skip ahead some time, and the Foxes are living in an underground den, where dad is a newspaper reporter (an endangered species?) and his son constantly disappoints him by having a singularly UNdaring nature.  Fox is a good husband and father, but his true nature constantly nags at him, and in a mad burst, he purchases an above ground tree in which to live.  And from there, he can clearly see the facilities of three big, evil farmers.  And it's a short step from there to returning (albeit without telling his wife) to a life of thieving and trickery.  It makes him feel young again and makes him feel he's being true to his nature.  It also gets him, his family and the whole animal community into some SERIOUS trouble.    There really isn't much to the plot, per se.  The film is more about little incidents, observations and conversations.  And it's all shown to us via stop-motion animation.  These furry animals move in a manner frankly reminiscent of the original KING KONG.  We see their fur move from frame to frame, where the animators clearly were manipulating the little creatures.  They are primitively constructed...and yet the film is 100% true to its own aesthetic throughout.  While many scenes look flat (and everything is brown)...there is a feeling of life in every moment.  It may be the rippling fur, and it may be the outstanding voice work.    George Clooney plays Mr. Fox and his wife is voiced by Meryl Streep.  Jason Schwartzmann is their cowardly, clumsy son.  These 3 work together very well, and although I wasn't sitting there the whole time noticing that stars were doing the voices...there was also a sense of familiarity that was very welcome.  Clooney has become a master of the \\"wacky\\" character (MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS, BURN AFTER READING, LEATHERHEADS)...and this movie shows that it is his voice as much as his physicality that makes this work.  Schwartzmann plays the \\"dreary\\" son much like we'd expect him to...infused with chagrin and sadness.    As I mentioned, Anderson's humor is often coupled with sadness...and we have that here too.  Whether Fox is longing for his past life, or his wife wishes her husband was happy with what he had or their son wishes Dad was prouder of him...that sense of sadness is there.  These are the richest animated characters in a long time (outside of most Pixar films)...and it's easy to care about these funny looking creatures.  There are many delightful other characters as well, including badgers (Bill Murray, hilarious), moles and so on.      But the movie can be readily enjoyed without reading much into it.  It's got loads of off-kilter humor (the shots of Fox eating are almost worth the price of admission!), a GREAT soundtrack (Anderson is almost as good as Tarantino at picking great music) and a satisfying conclusion, one that delivers a Hollywood feel, but is uniquely odd as well.    So please do yourself (and the film) a favor, and check out FANTASTIC MR. FOX.  It is, indeed, fantastic.
B002QB1910|4.0|I have seen a lot of artists come and go over the years, and Rihanna is the REAL DEAL.<br /><br />She has her own style.<br /><br />Either you like her or you don't.<br /><br />Rated R is her most diverse Album to date.<br /><br />Aside from a few POP bridges thrown in for the MASSES. If you listen carefully you can see the a TRUE artist on the RISE!<br />I look forward to watching her her grown over the next 20 yrs.<br /><br />At one time some said she would be a one HIT wonder. With the release of Rated R. All the critics ARE PROVEN wrong ONCE AGAIN.
0553582038|3.0|I would have given this book 2 stars if not for the inclusion of Sansa and Arya and the last 100 or so pages...  I understand and admire Mr. Martin for building out this incredibly rich and detailed world with a gazillion cast of characters.  BUT, it's becoming very hard to not only follow but also CARE about some of these characters.  I want to follow the Stark journey.  I want to follow Jamie and Tyrion's journey.  I don't care about Victarion and Arianne.  I'm tired of Cersei.  I want to learn more about Gendry and find out whatever happened to Rickon and Bran and all the direwolves running around.  I can see how Book 4 was kinda/sorta neccessary to begin bringing together all of these various factions and houses to meet in the middle.  But I truly hope there is a grand plan and that it comes together in the end.  I'm definitely going to read Boook 5 and hope it's better than Book 4.
B001BJ690Y|5.0|This Blu-Ray blew me away.   I won't go into the details of the movie because it's the best action movie of my generation.      The video and audio quality is amazing!  No other way to put it.  This is a MUST buy for Blu-Ray fans!
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|great product I hope. It is for Christmas, so i have not watched it yet.
0380730405|5.0|That famous line starts off the begining of Du Maurier's classic novel. The twenty-year-old female protaganist--whose first name we never know--is thrown into a whirlwind romance when she meets a much older man in a Monte Carlo hotel. He has recently lost his wife Rebecca, and is using his stay in Monte Carlo as a way to try and forget the past. Against her employer's advice, the unworldy and reserved protaganist becomes the new Mrs.de Winter in short order, and soon the couple return to his estate, Manderley.<br /><br />There, the new Mrs.de Winter expects everything to be perfect. Her illusions are quickly shattered when she realizes her new husband may still be in love with his dead wife, and seems to be hiding something from his past. Also, the Manderley housekeeper resents Mrs. de Winters presense for some unknown reason, and the west wing of the house is mysteriously not being used any longer. As the new Mrs. de Winter falls further and further under Manderley's spell she comes to realize that things are not always what they appear.<br /><br />Even though the theme of Rebecca may be a bit outdated in this day and age (my reaction would have been VERY different than the new Mrs. de Winter on learning the truth about my husband), this book definitely still stands the test of time. Slightly creepy and gothic, it's an interesting look into the lives of the wealthy and high-class almost a hundred years ago. Rebecca is like a fairy tale gone slightly wrong, for adults.
B00168OIOE|5.0|I'm a Pixar fan. They can do no wrong in my eyes. I love getting these Blu-Rays. I notice things I've never noticed before. With the amazing HD quality I was able to see the smallest detail, for instance the Menu at the Sushi restaurant. Just shows how much detail and love goes into each frame.
B002XHN776|5.0|it was really good, I especially LOVE the song night of the hunters, it has a good beat. Overall the album give's the band a good vibe, but at the same time it covey's a sense of uniqueness
B002AT4K9Q|3.0|some people have been saying that the disc won't read on some PS3s and players. It doesn't work on mine. I know it isn't my PS3 because it plays everything else fine.     just a warning. there may be a faulty batch of discs out. or maybe the PS3 firmware doesn't recognize the disc. It isn't widespread , otherwise we'd hear more about it.
1594488878|5.0|This novel is fantastic and is likely the best of Hornby's career to date!!!    This is a wonderful book that tells the story of relationships and captures all of the joy, hurt, discovery, warmth, sadness, and introspection that goes through one's head at the beginning and end of a relationship.      The story and its characters are touching both in their successes and failings, and each of the characters' evolution is both realistic and touching.      As good or better than High Fidelity, How to Be Good, About a Boy (and far better than Slam or A Long Way Down).  If you have ever read anything by Hornby, or have been meaning to, do yourself a favor and buy this book!!!
B001PU8N0I|5.0|This DVD is in perfect condition.  And it arrived within just a couple days of placing the order.  Excellent job.
B002XHN776|5.0|I have been a fan of 30stms for not that long I dare say. I was instantly hooked by  'The Kill' from the album 'A Beautiful Lie'; and have been a loyal twitter fan. After all the hype and anticipation/preparation for their new album I must say I am throughly satisfied. Worth every penny and every moment of listening pleasure. Each sone from start to finish takes you on a ride of  epic proportions. it BLASTS youinto outerspace and back into your listening chair. Enjoy- Echelon!!!
B0019LY5IM|4.0|It may seem weird that so many of the recent reviews are all about the packaging for the Season 5 DVD but once you buy it, you'll understand.  The first 4 seasons had a cool, sturdy plastic cover and the actual DVDs were in a foldout box that slipped out from under the cover (not sure if that makes sense LOL).  Very classy and the 4 seasons look really cool side by side on your DVD rack, but Season 5 is this cheap lame cardboard cover with the DVD foldout box coming out from the side...and instead of funky LOST inserts like a Dharma Manual, there are just some flimsy paper advertisements for other Buena Vista/ABC DVDs.  Feels like it could fall apart any second. It may not seem like that big a deal but why change the packaging after 4 seasons of the same DVD box? Looks weird lined up next to Seasons 1-4 not just because its different material but it's also much much slimmer which is just odd since Season 4 had less episodes.  (side note...I do like how people are writing alot about the DVD packaging because that's what these kinds of reviews are really supposed to be about...chances are the reader already knows all about the show)    That being said, the actual show itself is the best its ever been.  Every episode of Season 5 is a keeper with crazy action, even more character development (you know a show is good when you're still learning more about the characters 5 seasons in) and jaw-dropping cliffhangers. Used to think the third season was LOST's best but Season 5 without a doubt is the show's best so far.  Sure some episodes in Season 5 are better than others, but overall the show has truly raised the bar for quality scripted television.
0385334176|1.0|First, let me say that I am a big fan of Kurt Vonnegut.  I recently went back and read two of his books that I hadn't ever gotten around to, Deadeye Dick and Galapagos.  I have greatly enjoyed almost everyone of his books that I have read, from Sirens of Titan to Timequake and God Bless You Dr. Kevorkian.  That being said....    This book is terrible.  Absolute mush.  Not a good representation of Vonnegut's quirky writing style or even a basic story.  There is not a character in this book that any reasonable reader could possibly care about, relate to, or want to know more about.      The first three or four chapters are decent and trick you into thinking you are reading another great Vonnegut novel.  Then it all falls apart.  A boy is taunted after unintentionally killing a women.  His family is destroyed.  A town's population is eliminated by a neutron bomb.  And there are random recipes for cajun and soul food.  You get the impression that his goal was to tell the most absurd story he could fathom...except that there isn't really a story here.      I would steer clear of this even if you are a Vonnegut completist.  Unless you are deluded into thinking that everything the man ever wrote was brilliant (which, sorry, no dice), you will almost certainly be disappointed by this tripe.
B0018QCXH8|5.0|Movie came in standard blu-ray case. No scratches/blemishes/issues whatsoever.  Excellent 5 stars for the movie and the packaging!
1582701709|5.0|This is a great book to inspire someone to become a happier posative person.  The world would be a much nicer place if everyone read this and practiced it.
B002FE5XVK|5.0|If you've got the bigger screen and the bigger sound system, then don't worry so much about a chair because you won't be in one. The beginning of the performance is mostly solo and lower key so you can be moving all the furniture out of the viewing area. Just a remarkable and classic event.
B0007M22TI|4.0|Frankly, If I bought this, I would feel slightly ripped off.  I'm watching it now on PBS, and every song is definitely lip-synced or dubbed.  Shame on the producers.  A live concert is a live concert.  I simply can't watch it, as the lip syncing drives me nuts.<br /><br />5 stars for the music.<br /><br />3 stars for the visual production lie.<br /><br />4 stars overall.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I use mine to sharpen all my pocket knives and even hobby Exacto blades. Just use the finer ceramic side only for thinner and \\"not so dull\\" blades. The serrated rod works real good too!  Highly recommended.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|I liked very much the product, I received on time without any discrepancy at all.
B002PEP4HI|5.0|Such a great book. Religeon ~  common denominator -  love one another, help one another.
B001FB55HQ|5.0|First of all I absolutely LOVED the 1st movie, *kinda* liked the 2nd, and DESPISED the 3rd. I don't actually care why other people gave this movie bad reviews (to each his/her own) but I have had someone tell me they thought Terminator Salvation was \\"too dark\\".    Well yeah... That's the type of movie it's meant to be--post-apocalyptic and all. This was the future I've been hungry to see ever since Reese's flash-backs from the 1st movie and I'm glad it wasn't just another excuse to show off some cute smart-mouthed kid actor, etc... This one was gritty, which is really something I happen to dig in sci-fi movies.     Sometimes the reviews don't do justice. See it for yourself and decide whether or not you like Pepsi ads and Guns n Roses or a dark, moody thriller and, uh, more Guns n Roses...
0385504225|2.0|Had great expectation for this book which i've waited so long for.  I'm no historic/science buff but I know when some ideas sound smart or just down right boring.  I loved Angels & Demons and Da Vinci Code.  In TLS, Langdon is not acting like a brilliant expect that he was and I'm frustrated with the plot development and lack of good \\"mental floss\\" tidbits to impress me.  I'm 70% through but I'm dragging to finish because it doesn't look like it will have an amazing ending...
1400079276|2.0|As a word of caution, if you read novels for beautiful prose, avoid this book like the plague!  It's written like a vampire novel off the young adult fiction rack.  I don't know if it's Murakami or the translation; but reading Marakami's prose is like wading through sludge.  Each inelegantly constructed paragraph is filled with cliches, mundane adjectives, and superflous intensifiers.  If Murakami wrote like Pynchon, maybe this story would be bearable, but unduring 400 plus pages of prozaic writing in a book  requiring the reader's imagination to find a point is beyond tenable.  At least offer some pleasing paragraphs to entice the patient reader while he waits for a story to emerge.  I'm curious how others who enjoyed this novel so much were able to get beyond the prose, because I really wanted to enjoy Marakami but couldn't.
B001FB55MG|2.0|This movie has a cute premise and, had it been better executed, could have been a very sweet and funny film. There were definitely moments in it that worked. Unfortunately, many of the jokes fell short and I was not invested enough in the characters to care too much about the plot. The worst part, however, was that the script resorted to using offensive racial caricatures in a poor attempt at humor. For me, that ruined the rest of the movie. I will not be showing this one to my kids.
B002VECM3Q|5.0|OMG, I had no idea Rain was playing Raizo until the day before I went to watch the movie. I have to say that I was pleasantly suprised by his transformation from boy band hotty to Hot Ninja Assasin! I know he must have worked his butt off to get that body lean enough to do some of the actions in this movie. If you love blood/gore and ninja action then you will definately enjoy this movie. The synopsis was mentioned in the previous review so I won't go into that again, but I will say that the working chemistry between Rain and Naomi in this movie was relaxed and not ackward like in some movies in this genre like kiss of the dragon or Romeo must die where I get the feeling the actor/actress is acting rather than in a natural state of being. Sounds weird but I definately noticed the difference. I hope to see Rain in more lead roles, he makes one hellofa ninja.
B000ZECQ08|4.0|I love this movie, but as it was said in some other reviews, I fail to see how they are going to make up for the important scenes that they omitted in this film. So as not to spoil it for anybody who hasn't seen it or read the book, there are some very important things missing from this movie that will have to come to a head in the next one.     I didn't read any of the books prior to seeing this film, so I initially thought it was pretty good and set the scene for the next one. After seeing it, I was so curious to find out what was going to happen, I went back and read all the books. Once I read them (they were EXCELLENT by the way) I started to understand what others were talking about. There were so many things left out that I would think it will be quite difficult to find a way to write them in the way the book was written.     All in all, the movie is still pretty good.
0756405890|5.0|First I am a woman, second I am 40. Two counts against me for this genre. Fantasy, by its nature, is active reading. Meaning you have to read all the words and commit to the story and the unknown. I am a lazy reader for most of selections for this meaning, its due to recreational and easy escapes. This book took reading the first few chapters a couple times to retrain me but after that I dug right in and was in it for every unknown word or place.    I am looking forward to the rest of the story but know that it is on the authors time. If you get a moment read his blog. Hysterical! What a great guy!

B002RSDW80|5.0|I am very particular about movies; few and far between are the movies that I really enjoy, and even fewer & farther between are the ones that I want to watch over again.  I first saw this at the theater, and then have since seen the DVD via Netflix :)  I love the mixing of the storylines that go from past to present from Julia, to Julie.  The language in the movie wasn't great, there was some 'bad language' and I felt it could have easily have been left out, but I've heard the book was much worse (I have not read it).  I enjoyed the storyline very much.  As a 20-something I have heard of Julia Child, but wasn't familiar with her story, or really even her recipes.  And the food!  It seriously made me want to buy a copy of Mastering the Art of French Cooking (it is, as a matter of fact, on my Amazon Wishlist now :) and head to the kitchen.  I would highly recommend it.

B00005J8J6|5.0|Release of Led Zeppelin's IV in 1971 cemented their statue of a super group at forefront of the new frontier establishing itself in music partially because of them. It was called hard rock. Over a year earlier another band called Deep Purple had released their album called In Rock which also was becoming one of the most influential albums of this new hard sounding field. One of the songs of that album called Child In Time was a 10 minute long epic rock song connecting the beauty of melodic rock with the hard sounding rock, and featuring a long lasting guitar solo by Ritchie Blackmore. It is very possible that Stairway To Heaven was Led Zeppelin's answer to Child In Time. These two songs were compared and played together very often by us in the early 1970s. The beauty of Stairway To Heaven was breathtaking in terms of a concept, lyrics, the mood created by its first soft acoustic melodic minutes as well as by its harder progression. It has to be said that the main guitar riff does belong to the American band Spirit which you can hear in their song Taurus but by all means, all of you active musicians out there, go back to the 1960s and 1970s and do pick some beautiful moments you can find and elaborate on them, bring them to the wider audience who probably never heard these riffs and wouldn't have otherwise anyway. The progression of Stairway To Heaven is spectacular in its very even build up of tempo and energy, but not until we are allowed to float in the beauty of the acoustic part of this song long enough. Lyrically and spiritually this song was truly inspiring. The title was perfect, the beginning lyrics quite meaningful making us feel like we understand the following poetic progression in which clear thoughts were dressed in abstract catchy phrases allowing us all to make up our own stories. However, I would love to know how many of us might not have migrated west without `there's a feeling I get when I look to the west and my spirit is crying for leaving' inside of us. Stairway To Heaven, Going To California, The Battle Of Evermore and When The Levee Breaks. How on earth were they able to come up with such spectacular magic, all at once? Every one of these songs is special in its own way. These are the songs you need one of, to elevate the rank of your entire album by a couple of stars. Going To California has for a long time been my favorite song of this album. Its simple beauty of melodic line, acoustic sound and Robert's voice addressing Joni Mitchell make this song perfect to me. The Battle Of Evermore's poetic and mysterious lyrics addressing Tolkien's The Lord Of The Rings probably mean more to you if (as I have in my teens), you have walked into Tolkien's kingdom at some point in your life, but the main power of this song lies to me in the beautiful harmony of vocals (Robert Plant was singing this song together with Sandy Denny of Fairport Convention) with the acoustic folk music carried mainly by mandolin and guitar. There is this simple repetitive element to this harmony which attracts me a lot. When The Levee Breaks has this spectacular distorted sound to it echoed and engineered perfectly to give us this very unusual addictive atmosphere. My personal favorite songs of Led Zeppelin are the following: Battle Of Evermore, All My Love, Since I've Been Loving You, Baby I'm Gonna Leave You, When The Levee Breaks, Going To California, Kashmir, I'm Gonna Crawl, Tangerine, The Rain Song, Thank You and Stairway To Heaven.e of us.

B000001GAJ|5.0|Marvelous concerto for viola piano and string orchestra, beautiful execution by Argerich and Kremer, musical, balanced, right tempi. One point of critisism is the recording quality of the orchestral violin parts, which seem harsh at times (you can hear it in the listen examples). But it does not take away from 5 stars, this is one of those rare exceptional performances, a must have.
B001GQACGO|4.0|The gimmick behind Beyonce's latest album is kind of weak if you ask me.  I mean, come on; \\"I become Sasha Fierce when I get on stage\\".  That is your `story'?  So, she compiles her album in two parts.  First, we have the Beyonce side.  That is your ballads and slow-jams.  Then we have the Sasha side.  That is your dance club hip-hop tracks.<br /><br />I prefer Beyonce.<br /><br />I'll start there I guess.  Notice please, I gave this album a B, so I obviously liked it.  I just find that it is deeply flawed, and really, the high grade is based on a handful of greatness trailing behind it some memorable mediocrity.<br /><br />I was one of the few around me that actually loved `If I Were A Boy'.  I agree that conceptually it is very bad.  The idea that Beyonce suggest here, that all men are basically pigs and don't know how to treat women, is really offensive and childish.  The fact that I could easily compile a song about how, if I were a girl, I would overact to everything, care solely about my own feelings, insist that my man spend ALL HIS TIME WITH ME AND ONLY ME and thoughtlessly spend all his money all the while refusing him sex because `I'm tired' is just a testament to how lazy and clich&eacute;d this song really is.  That said, Beyonce sounds impeccable and, for some reason, I absolutely love it in all its absurdity.<br /><br />`Halo' is easily the best track on the album (thank you OneRepublic guy).  It's so rich with texture and just infects me with greatness.  I adore it, completely.  `Broken-Hearted Girl' is the strongest ballad (in the classic sense, since I don't really consider `Halo' an outright ballad).  It is just beautiful.  I have commented before on Beyonce's voice being technically sublime but rather uninteresting.  She sounds like a lot of other singers out there.  That said, when she really hits the mark she does so flawlessly, and when you take her talent and focus it in the right direction with the right song (this one is just stunning in all areas, including lyrically) you get something that is utterly marvelous.<br /><br />I still get shivers when I hear her say \\"I don't wanna love you, in no kinda way.\\"<br /><br />Songs like `Disappear', `Ave Maria' and `Smash Into You' are beautiful and effective.  `Disappear' is a tad repetitive and a little aggravating over time, but it has some stellar moments of vocal purity.  There is a simplicity to `Smash Into You' that really gives me goosebumps.  It really rests on Beyonce nicely.<br /><br />`Satellites' is bland, `That's Why You're Beautiful' is just bad.<br /><br />Now, we have the `Fierceness' herself; Sasha.<br /><br />`Single Ladies' may very well be THE SONG OF THE YEAR, and while I don't love it like everyone else, even I cannot deny the fact that it is infectious, fun, fresh and totally adorable.  I still kind of prefer `Sweet Dreams', but that's just me.  Sadly, this side of the album doesn't bare as much fruit as the first.  `Diva' is fun, if not a tad uninspiring.  I mean, it is totally club worthy, but it just doesn't really have much `standout quality' to it.  `Scared of Lonely' is better, if not completely different.<br /><br />And then you have a slew of, well, meh songs.  `Radio', `Hello', `Ego'...they all have their moments but those moments are far from enough to make these worthy tracks.  `Ego' especially is just really bad.  I mean, there are parts of that song that make me say \\"well maybe this is good\\" and then that ridiculous chorus line cuts in again and I go \\"eek, this is bad.\\"  That said, nothing on this album is as bad as `Video Phone'.  That is just gross.  It has a great beat, but it is so stupid it nearly makes my ears bleed.<br /><br />So, like I said, the strength of a few stellar tracks and a slew of memorable mediocrity gets this album a grade it may not really deserve.  Maybe next time Beyonce will leave Sasha out of the studio and reserve her for the stage only.get something that is utterly marvelous.

B0029LHW68|5.0|Epic album. There is so much raw emotion in every song. Yes, some of this is directed at the battle with the record label but there are also a lot of personal battles described. This album is as though you are watching a movie in your head.     This is a thought provoking, inspirational, motivating, triumphant piece of art.     When you get to the top of a hill, you keep climbing to the top of the next - you don't want to stay on the same road or go down the other side. Without re-inventing and improving, there will be no success. The band has succeeded in making it to the top of the next hill. Jared's voice sounds amazing - his best ever on this album and hearing the songs live are even better.     The band said it best - you're either going to love this album or hate it.     I love it.

B0000YEEHG|5.0|\\"Persona\\" (1966) is a film about many things on many levels. It can be seen an experimental deconstructivist film, or as a film about identity and nothingness, or as a film with any number of other themes. Actress Elisabet Vogler (Liv Ullmann) has a breakdown, and after a short stint in the hospital she is taken care of by Alma (Bibi Andersson) at a remote seaside cottage. Elisabet never speaks to Alma, and so Alma fills the silence with her intimate life stories. After a time it is as if the two woman are gradually becoming one. Alma speaks for, and interprets what Elisabet is thinking. This is a powerful, and thought provoking film, that gradually lays down layers upon layers of images, as it develops this story that becomes something of an unconscious power struggle between, and within, two people, as their identities gradually become reversed over time, as Alma seems like the patient, and Elisabet, the caregiver.<br /><br />It could also be said that Ingmar Bergman is making a statement about how it is impossible to really know another person, and that we project our ideas and values onto other people. The speechless Elisabet acts like an empty vessel that Alma projects her own ideas and feelings upon. Elisabet is the actor, the blank slate, that changes her personality and character with each role she plays. Perhaps this was also what led her to have her break down. She had lost her sense of self, her identity. Ingmar Bergman reminds us that the film we are watching is a fabrication, a recreation on celluloid, with the initial film clips, and with the fragmenting of the image as the film appears at one point to burn up before resuming the story of the two women. The white light of the projection is the blank slate that the director fills with images and his story, just as Elisabet is the blank slate of Alma's projections of who she thinks Elisabet is. Alma doesn't really know who Elisabet is, she only knows Elisabet from the roles she has played as a screen actress.<br /><br />I watched this film with the original mono Swedish audio, with English subtitles. There is also an English (mono audio ) dubbed version for the soundtrack, but I wouldn't recommend using it as it spoils the mood and atmosphere of the film. The English dubbed voice used for Alma sounds like a young girl, which gives an altogether different quality to Alma's voice.<br /><br />There is also a featurette with interviews with the actors and Ingmar Bergman, as well as an audio commentary by Marc Gervais. This is the uncensored, theatrical version of the film, with a new (2004) digital transfer of the film that is presented in the original aspect ratio of 1.33 to 1.<br /><br />2014 Update:<br />The 2014 dual format Criterion release includes many more special features than the MGM release, such as a 84 minute interview with Liv Ullmann, on-set footage (18 min), a recent interview with Paul Schrader (10 min), a visual essay on the film's prologue by Bergman scholar Peter Cowie, as well as archival interviews with Bergman, Ullman, and Bibi Andersson. The Criterion release also has a booklet with an essay by film scholar Thomas Elsaesser, as well as excerpts from a 1970 book \\"Bergman on Bergman\\", and excerpts from a 1977 interview with Andersson.

031606792X|5.0|It has been a while since I was so enthralled in a book series. This series is awesome and left me wanting more. Too many people are too criticalinstead of letting their imaginations take over. This book allowed me to do so. It is such a beautiful story of love and devotion with just enough drama to keep you hooked. It would be wonderful if more books were written in this series. I would love to know more about the characters lives.
1585673927|5.0|A collection of short humorous stories starring Bertram Wooster, a young English aristocrat of the Jazz age, and his cold-blooded, tactful and resourceful \\"gentleman's gentleman\\", Jeeves (first name never disclosed, or is it the surname that isn't disclosed!?). All but the last of the stories are told in Wooster's voice; the last, and, in my opinion, funniest one is told in Jeeves'.<br /><br />Most stories have the same structure: one of Wooster's pals, all of whom are upper class and hopeless sinecures, totally dependent on their rich aunts or uncles for sustenance, gets himself entangled in a silly contretemps of some sort. Wooster \\"rallies round\\" to his aid, calling upon his man Jeeves' superior strategic mind to provide the ruse that will save the day. It is only in the end of the story when the full nature of Jeeves' ploy is fully realized by Wooster and us.<br /><br />The stories are very well written, and engaging from the first letter to the last. They kept me constantly on the smile, often on the chuckle, and occasionally made me laugh out loud, particularly during the final story, \\"Bertie Changes his Mind\\".<br /><br />Wodehouse is a master of the English language. His vocabulary is very rich but very precise: i would often send a fumbling hand for the dictionary, and unflinchingly discover that the lexical definition of the word under consideration fits the usage to the T. He extracts every last drop of comedy from starchy, musty grammatical constructs, such as \\"Often of a spring morning\\", used to great effect in a memorable passage from one of the stories, \\"The Artistic Career of Corky\\".<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book enough. I'd been searching for a while for a book that would make me laugh. My penultimate attempt was Christopher Moore's \\"Fool\\"; suffice it to say that it is now on indefinite loan to one of my least favorite acquaintances. But from \\"Carry On, Jeeves\\" i shall not easily part.

B001JNNDGA|1.0|If you like to see a mean beaten mercilessly for 2.5 hours, this is the movie for you.    As far as the story goes.... what story?  There is nothing here that we haven't heard a millions times -- it is just re-rendered in ultra-graphic, sadistic technicolor.  Yes, there are many violent movies out there, but few that make that violence quite so intimate and relentless.  I haven't counted, but I'd wager that there is maybe 10 minutes of footage where Jesus is not being beaten, and blood dripping from those wounds.  It is pure cruelty.  Why anyone would enjoy watching this is beyond me.    Yes, other movies are violent, but this is typically a device used for contrast; a price for wisdom gained.  As I have stated, there is no wisdom gained here.  There is almost no footage dedicated to the teachings of this great man.  There is nothing imaginative or transcendent about this film, it is just cruelty on celluloid.  A spectacle of his supreme sacrifice.    The shooting of this film in Aramaic, Hebrew and Latin is just a joke.  Again, it adds nothing to the story.  It is like putting the Irish Flag on an American beer, and passing it off as a \\"Premium Lager\\".  Somehow, because this film was shot in cryptic languages, this makes it more \\"official\\" than those other Jesus films made in English... The Irish flag may fool those buffoons with a poor palate, but for the real connoisseurs -- they aren't fooling anyone.    This movie imparts nothing, except that we should feel guilty about what ancient people's did to a great man.  Guilt is cheap.  Violence is cheap.  Give me Wisdom, Solomon asked for no less.
B001OQCV24|4.0|another disaster flick, albeit one with bigger stakes. The whole world. We have already seen the Eiffel Tower fall. The Sears Tower crumble, the head & the arm of the Statue of Liberty fall off etc. etc. That's  Life Without People, on tv. Lots of that sort of thing in 2012. The Capitol falls down, Christ The Redeemer in Rio explodes, Californis slides into the Pacific etc. etc. The poles are shifting, remaking the continents. Mount Everest makes a cameo appearence. The story in between, nothing special. Arks are being built in China to save our species. The probelm is that those that have a seats apparently don't want to go. Danny Glover plays a rather pious & stupid president. He decides to die. So does his daughter. But she gets a seat anyway to make nice with the young  neurotic scientist, played by Chiwetel Ejiafor. He is racked with guilt for living. Then there is John Cusack, the novelist, his estranged wife with new tits, (Amanda Peel), their kids & her new boyfriend, the plastic surgeon. Let's throw in a rich, evil Russian & his bimbo, also with new tits. There is of course a cast of billions who do want to get on the ark. But the special effects are the thing. I'd say award winning. Otherwise, you have a variation on Independence Day, Water World, The Day After. You get the idea.

B001FB55HQ|2.0|Well, this week I've watched three recently released action films.  And in my opinion, CGI is just over the top!  Movies just don't look real anymore.  They look just too animated and kind of fake.  I just watched the new Star Trek, G. I. Joe, and this new fourth installment of The Terminator saga.  The action scenes are now more intense, unrealistic, and overwhelming.  There is so much LESS story, human interaction, compassion, and drama, and MORE visual screen consuming effects.  They even had a computer animated Terminator of Arnold Schwarzennegger.  This goes to show that pretty soon, movies won't even need actors anymore.  Computer animators will create new movie stars (heroes and villains).  Technology, again, is removing the human element of upcoming future jobs and physical social interaction.<br /><br />And, about the argument about Blue-Ray over the standard DVD:  I know that Blue Ray offers a better High Definition picture.  So, if I got myself conditioned to watching Hi Def films, I will then see the reduced quality of all my regular DVD's, and I don't want that to happen.  I'm at a level of tolerance that allows me to enjoy all my regular DVD's.  Blue Ray would just start me on a journey of frustration because I have so many good movies on DVD, and I do not want to buy them again.  Even renting Blue Ray will open the door to hindering my appreciation of my own standard DVD's.  Ignorance is bliss for me.  Blissful, and affordable, because I am done buying movies.  I can put my money towards better things these days.  So, you people just keep buying your favorite movies, over and over again.  It's only money.
B0029LHW68|4.0|...wow. This is not what I was expecting.    Being a casual fan of 30 Seconds to Mars, brought in by the great vocals on \\"The Kill\\" and following their roots back to their absolutely superb debut album, I've always had my ups and downs with the band. They seem to write interesting songs and their instrumentation is varied and interesting. They've always seemed to be above the cut of the usual \\"alt-rock\\" bands littering the airwaves. Yet, their sound is constantly evolving, and it's sometimes hard to follow their progress. How does a band come up with something as atmospheric and powerful as \\"Echelon\\" and then churn out the unaplogetically emo \\"Attack\\"? How can Jared Leto have such a beautifully soaring voice and then just ruin the song altogether with a series of wailing screams?    As such, I liked only parts of the previous album \\"A Beautiful Lie\\". Several songs were beautiful, and several more could have beautiful if not for Leto's aforementioned screaming. Seriously, that emo-wail almost totally turned me off to this band. The instrumentation was good, but also a little too mainstream. And a couple of songs were simply sub-par.    And so, upon purchasing this album without having listened to any samples of it beforehand, I felt a little anxiety as I put the CD into the player. But as it turns out, while this is ONCE AGAIN a new direction for the band, it's one I wholeheartedly enjoy for the most part. Combine elements of U2, Pink Floyd, Angels & Airwaves, and some of Linkin Park's newer material, and you'll have an understanding of 30 Seconds to Mars' new sound. Since I'm a huge fan of all 4 of the above bands, many songs on this album are amazing to me. And even better, no screaming! That annoying wail only shows up a few times and is blissfully short whenever it surfaces, leaving only the \\"good parts\\" of Jared's vocals: haunting whispers and soaring cries...    ...oh, and also the voices of thousands of 30STM fans, recorded at a live show. This is one of the reasons I give this album 4 stars, along with the fact that some of the songs are once again sub-par, including 100 Suns, Search and Destroy, and L490. I don't mind the choir - in fact, it's a novel way of including your fanbase that I've never seen another band attempt - but I don't like the way the choir is used as the main vocals for parts of certain songs. They serve well as a supplement to Jared's amazing vocals, but shoudn't be used as a replacement.      Long story short - do you like U2, Pink Floyd, Angels & Airwaves, and (recent) Linkin Park? Did you think many of the previous album's songs were ruined by unnecessary emo screams? Do you like \\"epic\\" sounding songs which have a 5+ minute run time? If so, regardless of your previous feelings about 30 Seconds to Mars, this album is a keeper.
0312380852|5.0|This is an excellent book for Micro-Macrame.  It has many, beautiful designs from simple to complex.  I found the instructions easy to understand and the diagrams were very good.    The book does over-estimate the thread lengths, however.  I suppose the logic is that too much thread is better than not enough.  I completed the Paristan Necklace, which recommended 50\\" lengths of cord (which will be folded in half).  When the small medallion was complete, I had 18\\" on each strand, i.e., an extra 3 feet.      I found some advice on how to measure cord for a project:  Take the length of a project (i.e., a 16\\" necklace) and multiply by 8.      Also, the instructions are for thread thinner than C-Lon, allowing two threads to pass through a 4mm Swarovski crystal.  C-Lon will allow only one thread pass, which means I had to make an adjustment to the design.    I would definitely recommend this book.  It's one of the best micro-macrame books I have seen.
044654146X|5.0|The book well written, sticks to the facts with no-political aspects.  Has very good examples, tells about the true nature of the Israelies and not stigma's.    Very recommended book!
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Taylor Swift's sophomore effort is a perfect album. Taylor is known for her ability to write songs in 20 minutes, but her songs doesn't sound like it. Actually, they're really sensitive and amazingly good. Taylor is often accused of only writing about high school love and that's why some people hate her and I think she's underrated. She shouldn't be compared to young Disney stars who have no talent, because she's really talented and she worked her way to the top. It's true that she's not a Dolly Parton or a Faith Hill, but she doesn't want to be. She's only 20, and she's singing about things that happened to her, but as she grows older, she's gonna be more mature and I'm sure she's gonna put out better and better albums.  In fact there's something for everyone on this album.    Fearless (5/5) At first I wasn't too fond of this song but it really grew on me and now it's one of my favs. For me, this song is about being fearless in life. Not a love song.  Fifteen (5/5) Amazingly nice song about your first day in high school, knowing no one, but finding friends at last. Again, not a love song.  Love Story (5/5) Beautiful song about an idealized Romeo and Juliet kinda forever-lasting love. This song can make you really happy.  Hey Stephen (5/5) The song is about convincing a boy to let her in. I think a lot of girls can relate to this song.  White Horse (5/5) Very sad song about being let down by a boy, who you loved. Again, relatable.  You Belong With Me (5/5) I think this song is about the same story as Terdrops On My Guitar, just from a different angle. I could be wrong though.  Breathe (5/5) Saying goodbye to someone that you used to depend on, and feeling all alone in the world cuz you can't breathe without them. Love song but ANYONE can relate to it, it's not about teenage love.  Tell Me Why (5/5) One of the best songs on the album. Check it out. :)  You're Not Sorry (5/5) Very sad song, amazing.  The Way That I Loved You (4/5) Being with a perfect guy but missingthe imperfection of the previous one that you loved so much. Very good lyrics and song.  Forever & Always (5/5) The Joe Jonas song. (Lol, I hate that guy.) Anyway it's about insecurity about a relationship, because you \\"don't feel welcome anymore\\".  The Best Day (5/5) Beautiful song about loving your parents and being thankful how they made your childhood happy. Not a love song again.  Change (4/5) Maybe this song doesn't quite fit for the album, it's a pop/rock song actually. Not a love song.    So there are 9 love songs out of 13, I don't think it's that much. Most of the singers sing about relationships. She herself said that it's her favourite topic and I'm perfectly happy with it. So if you wanna listen to songs about the weather or work or whatever, it's not your album. And if you expect Dolly Parton, it's not your album either. Then listen to Dolly Parton, because in 2009 no one will sing those kind of old-fashioned songs.    5/5 for this amazing album.
B002SJIO54|5.0|Excellent film, period. If you can't handle the hand held film style stick to television. Great story, clever and creative execution. The best sci-fi is definitely coming from outside the U.S. (see The Host.) Watch this movie!
B001GQACGO|1.0|Beyoncé always makes so much marketing and hype about her albums, so that a lot of people buy them. I bought this album because I considered myself a fan, however I really hate Single Ladies, it's a very annoying song. If I Were a Boy is ok but it's stolen. She also stole Halo (which used to be the a song I liked) from Kelly Clarkson, whose I'm Already Gone is much better because she co-wrote it, and it has sense at least.    There are tons of ballads on this album and none of them are strong. You can put up with Ave Maria, Disappear and Smash Into You when you're in the mood for them, but they're mostly background music for doing whatever. The additional 2 songs on Disc 1, that are not on the normal version of this album, are forgettable, so they aren't worth it.  Disc 2 also sucks. And I don't understand why she has a Beyoncé and a Sasha Fierce CD, when both has ballads and uptempo songs. Diva, Video Phone and Ego really sucks imo.    After all, the only good songs on this album are the popish stuff: Sweet Dreams, Hello, Broken-Hearted Girl and maybe Halo. They are all trash too, but listenable at least. However you got bored with them after 4-5 listens, if not sooner. Don't buy this album. Let us make her realize, that we need a better album, like B'Day was.
B000002I25|5.0|I bought this cd. for the song The End. But I find myself listening to other songs also. I recommend this for doors lovers.
B000001DQI|5.0|The 17 songs featured on Goodbye Yellow Brick Road are arguably the finest of his many collaborations with Bernie Taupin.     Definitely one of the best albums that Elton and Bernie have ever done. This was the first really cohesive album, though it covered a fantastic range of styles so well that most other artists couldn't even come close to the breadth of this album. From the out and out prog rock of \\"Funeral For A Friend\\" to the absolutely beautiful closing ballad \\"Harmony\\", you feel as if you are going on a journey with Elton, Bernie and the band.     Basically, there are so many truly classic songs on here, that to single out one or two would be just plain wrong. Even though this album is now more than 30 years old, it puts a lot of others made in the meantime to shame - in such ways as lyrics, songwriting craft, and musicianship.     To my way of thinking, this album was only bettered by Elton et al once - on the absolutely sublime masterpice that is Captain Fantastic and most recently The Captain and The Kid.
0307454541|5.0|Great book! Very complex character development and story line, I kept having to flip back pages. Good long book for a vacation. My attention wavered a little bit towards the end, but the action picked up very quickly and had quite the ending!
B00008WT5E|5.0|This is AC/DC's lowest selling album in the U.S. As an AC/DC fan for 30 years. \\"Powerage\\" is a little heavier on the blues influence than any of the other albums. Every song is a winner. Anyone who likes AC/DC should have this in their collection.    1. Rock n roll damnation - what a great song this is to open up the album, this is ac/dc in their prime. 10/10  2. Downpayment blues - this is a slower track but features incredible solo's from angus young - 10/10  3. Gimmie a bullet - another great song, the opening is superb with a great verse and a cthch chorus, wonderful stuff - 9.5/10  4. Riff raff -  great work from the youngs on this one, great song-9/10  5. Sin city -  classic dc- 8/10  6. Whats next to the moon - set by the signature groove of drummer phil rudd  - 9/10  7. Gone shootin - another amazing track from dc,  another varied classic track - 10/10  8. Up to my neck in you -  this is a frentic rocker which will have your fists pounding in the air, another great track - 9.5/10  9. Kicked in the teeth -  the riff is very similar to let there be rock, still a good song though as dc give it there all - 8.5/10
B0013FSL0C|5.0|Buy it; watch it and you will see why this will go from strength to strength. The acting is spot on as are the characters themselves. The psychotherapy its self is not perfect (neither is Yalom) and that is what makes this series so good .I can not wait for the next collection to come out.
B00009RAJI|5.0|\\"Rumours\\" is FLEETWOOD MAC'S best album. The best two songs on the album are a hit, \\"Go Your Own Way,\\" and an album track, \\"The Chain.\\" Both fuse good production with a strong sense of drama . \\"Go Your Own Way\\" has a bone-crushing vocal hook and \\"The Chain\\" is one of the most brilliantly bitter-sounding songs around. \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" has some of this drama as well.Other good songs are the bittersweet \\"Songbird\\" ,\\"Don't Stop\\" and \\"Dreams.\\" The hit \\"You Make Loving Fun\\" is a very strong.The rest of the album is a pop rock masterpiece.
B002KEDQJQ|5.0|The song choices for this movie were spot on perfect.  Placed the scenes in the right moment of time.
B000000OSG|5.0|Use Your Illusion 2 is part 2 of the Use Your Illusion albums .  The remake of\\"Knockin On Heavens Door\\" is good. \\"Get in The Ring\\" is a very funny song, but very explicet, but good. The punky \\"Shotgun Blues\\" is a fun song. \\"Breakdown\\" is a very good song . \\"Pretty Tied Up\\" is one of the most interesting songs on the album. It is very different. \\"Locamotive\\" is a great and very interesting song. \\"You Could Be Mine\\" is a fast paced song and one of the best.  There is a version of \\"Don't Cry\\" with different lyrics. Some more popular songs like \\"Estranged\\", \\"Civil War\\", and \\"So Fine\\" . But this is  a very great album from an amazing rock/metal group. This band had a world of talent. It's a shame that they have had so many problems. Buy the album .
B000A0GYD2|5.0|When I purchased this not to long ago it was my impression that this was a documentary. It's not. Instead each episode has a brief introduction by Tom Hanks and is a dramatization of the events that happened pertaining to that episode played by somewhat familiar faces in the movie and tv industry. And though that could have been a car wreck, it wasn't, by far. Instead it turns out to be very entertaining, and encompasses more of the details that would arguably have been boring and difficult to convey in the standard documentary format. This is a must watch if not buy for anyone interested in the subject matter.
B000000OSE|5.0|\\"Use Your Illusion I\\" is an extremely ambitious album from Guns N' Roses. It's just straight ahead great heavy metal with amazing ballads like \\"Don't Cry\\" and \\"November Rain\\". The second half rocks also, with my favorites being \\"Don't Damn Me\\", \\"The Garden\\", \\"Dead Horse\\", and of course the  10 minutes plus closing track \\"Coma\\".  this one is  a must have.
B002W1UEW4|1.0|This movie is bad. I suffered through it, because I'm a big fan of scifi and also of comic book films. But no. I felt awful after struggling through the length of this film. So much so that I decided to watch another movie immediately after, as if to counter the negative effects of GI Joe. What did I watch? Terminator: Salvation. And you know what? Compared to this movie, it was amazing.
B000001ESN|5.0|Permanent Waves is a sort of arrival record. Up until this point Rush played as fast and as long as they could to show their prowess. With this album they abandon that theory and begin crafting shorter, more powerful songs with a much better result.One of the things noticeable on this album is how Rush starts allowing the music to be influenced by the lyrics. This is very evident on \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" where the music becomes almost as ominous as the lyrics themselves. Rush learns more subtlety with songs like \\"Entre Nous\\" and we get to hear Peart exploring his drum set around the words he's written.The double punch of \\"Spirit Of Radio\\" and \\"Freewill\\" demonstrate how Rush doesn't need a 10 minute song to play like Gods or get their lyrical ideas across. \\"Natural Science\\" is a bit of a return to the longer form of songwriting, except this is simply outstanding.For the first time up to this point, Rush has released an album that is powerful from beginning to end...something that would continue for many years. Usually on the earlier albums there was some hit and miss with songs being great and some being just awesome.
B000002UA5|2.0|This is a review for the studio potion of the album, not the live portion.    I've always been a Pink Floyd fan. I've listened to all of their albums from Piper to the Division Bell and liked most of every one.    That being said, this is the last album of theirs I decided to check out. Mostly because of Gilmour himself saying it is a horrible album(although he did say the same about Atom Heart Mother which is one of my favorites).    A lot of it is mostly psychedelic noise. While I am a fan of psychedelic music it's just not done really well here. I'd say the only tracks on it worth listening to are Gilmour's part of it(The Narrow Way). I enjoyed that part but that's about it. I really do not understand why it is reviewed so highly here, it is not well done at all. It sounds as if they attempted an epic sound but failed miserably.    Unless you're a big Pink Floyd fan I don't recommend getting this album. It has it's good parts, but it is just overall a poorly put together album.
B000001FO4|5.0|Long Cold Winter, the follow up to Cinderella's debut Nightsongs. This album showed they weren't a hair band, but had style and substance that went beyond the superficial image they portrayed. Altogether more bluesy and and a hint of things to come on the third album \\"Heartbreak Station\\" Keifer's voice is in fine form and the title track still sends shivers up my spine.
B00168OIOE|5.0|To call Monster's Inc. a \\"kid movie\\" wouldn't do it justice.  The movie is a sweet, warm and funny movie that is easily amongst the best of its kind.  When I first saw this movie I was going through that \\"kids movies are stupid\\" phase.  I wouldn't watch kids movies, and generally had nothing positive to say about them.  By happenstance I happened upon Monster's Inc., and was not just surprised by how much I liked it, but how much I loved it.  I've watched it, re-watched it, and watched it again.  I love the characters, the clever concept of Monsters who are afraid of kids, and the use of laughter being more powerful than any scream.  I imagine this will be a movie I'll watch with my kids, who will watch it with their kids, and still be watched long after I'm gone.  The movie is just that well made.  If you haven't seen it, stop reading this review and watch it right now.
B000003TAR|5.0|In Utero is a great CD. from the opening of \\"Serve the servents\\" to the mellow \\"all apologies\\". highlights are the metal friendly \\"scentless apprentice\\", the fast punk-like \\"Radio friendly Unit shifter\\",the fast and slow melancholy of \\"rape me\\" and the depressed ballads \\"heart-shaped box\\" and \\"pennyroyal tea\\".
B00005JKNF|5.0|I have only received this DVD last week and already have seen it 3 times.  You need to see it more than once to understand all the dialogue and different plots.  Loved the movie.  The actors were well chosen and to have Maggie Smith, Helen Mirren, and Eileen Atkins and others in one movie was a real treat.  Now I wish to read the book, which is on the way I believe.  Goody!
B000002GVO|5.0|This is  the Eagles's best album . It represented a big change in the Eagles's style of music. They went from slow, easygoing songs to more upbeat songs such as \\"Life in the Fastlane\\" and \\"Victim of Love\\" in this album. Of course \\"Hotel California\\" was  the biggest song of their career, but all of them are great.  Even the ones like \\"The Last Resort\\"  was a  good songs. If you want to buy any album by the Eagles other than the Greatest Hits, I would definitely recommend buying this one.
B00003CXA2|4.0|Disc 1 is \\"fine and dandy\\" for fans like me who'd watched this movie literally over hundred times. Disc 2 is not that \\"more\\" as back cover printed, each video is short and not detailed about productions. Perhaps in earlier years around 2001, viewers didn't demand detail behind-the-scenes. By the way, \\"screen test\\" (or audition now so called) is worth to see. And the disc print is grey not colored, I think it might be a revised version.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've only written one other review for Amazon so believe me when I say this DVD is AWESOME!!  I had been going to the gym and power walking for months.  During those months, I had only lost 8 pounds.  Desperate, I purchased P90X and after a couple of weeks and realizing I needed to purchase so much equipment to complete the workouts, I gave that up.  After searching through Amazon Customer Reviews, I found Jillian Michaels' DVD highly rated...and the price was also right.  Another selling point was the only equipment I needed was a couple of dumbbells and a mat.  Even though I had never heard of Jillian Michaels (I've never watched the Biggest Loser) I purchased the 30 Day Shred, not expecting too much and figuring I'd quit in 2 weeks.       Well, 3 months and 35 pounds later, I can say this DVD is all the workout you'll need.  The workouts are only 25 minutes long (no excuse for busy women), but they're tough.  After a couple of weeks and thinking you can't take anymore, you'll notice your body changing.  After another 2 weeks, you'll notice the pounds melting off.  In less than 3 months, I have went from a size 16 to a size 8 and that's without any extreme dieting.      Again, I must stress, the workouts are tough.  There have been a few times that I've cursed at the TV, hoping Jillian would hear me and ease up.  But after the workout is over (and my heart stops trying to pound its way off my chest), I feel wonderful.  Trust me, completing her workouts, especially workout 3 (there are 3 different workouts), is a great accomplishment. I'm over 40 and haven't felt this great in years.  I just gave up my gym membership and have purchased her other DVD, [[ASIN:B001NFNFMQ Jillian Michaels: No More Trouble Zones]] (also awesome), and now alternate between the 2 so I don't get bored.      I have another 20 pounds to lose and I am positive I will lose them with her help.  In fact I'll be purchasing more of her workouts as a Christmas present to myself.  You can't go wrongwith her DVDs, especially for the price.  And trust me, after a month of working out with Jillian, you'll be recommending her on Amazon and to all of your friends too.  If I could, I would give the 30 Day Shred more than 5 stars.
1582701709|2.0|I bought this book a while ago and read it last month.  It was an easy read, and I first thought it made sense and started telling people about it.  Most had already heard of it and thought it was pretty good.  Then I ran into a physicist friend who pooh-poohed it.  He said that the premise that likes attract is opposite of how nature works.  He cited endless examples showing that likes actually repel; instead opposites attract - at least at atomic level.  He told me about another book called Ordaining Reality in Brief, which promises the same positive feedback, but supports it by showing how to utilize the laws of nature.  I just finished that book and plan to write a review soon.  I am very happy with it as it seems to make sense and it actually tells me what I need to do to have my thoughts actually change outcomes.  It gets into specific meditation and tells you why.  In The Secret, although it was enjoyable to read, and a lot faster to get through even though they are the about the same number of pages, basically relates a bunch of personal anecdotes that tell you how this or that person accomplished some feat and suggests that you can also do this by having positive thoughts.  It was inspiring until I thought about it and what my physicist friend said.  I strongly believe that positive thinking leads to positive results, and I think there is a lot of evidence to support that.  This book just doesn't explain how it works, whereas the other one does.  Maybe you should read both and see what you think.
B00049QQHI|1.0|This just can't be me alone!  I could not finish this disjointed, boring, bad acting mistake called a movie.  I like Leo, but bought it for Mark Walberg.  I either didn't recognized him or he didn't make the first half of this waste of film and my time.  Skip this one. Watch Leo in \\"Titanic\\" or \\"Blood Diamonds\\" or Mark in \\"Shooter\\" or \\"Planet of the Apes\\".  These in my humble opinion are good films and should be seen.  I would rather try to stomach a plate of brussel sprouts than start this film over.
B002OOG6RQ|5.0|The amazing thing is the album gets better and better on subsequent listenings.  Even on the 30th play I notice new elements and find the songs more attractive than ever.  It is so unusual for a band to make music this good this late in their careers.  This is a real achievement and as it may well be their last studio album, it is a wonderful way to close out their studio sessions (they will tour for years, dont worry).  Dont miss this album even if you are a new Rammstein fan.  For those of us who are already fans, this ranks as one of their best and most complex albums ever.
0671027387|5.0|I thought it was thrilling and find it hard to believe that it hasn't been made into a movie yet.  Great storyline, scenes, characters and props.  I highly recommend it and thought it just as good as his other books.
B00005ASOC|5.0|This film is a lot more than the story of a black boy from the Bronx finding his full realization in both basket-ball and creative writing. This film is a lot more than the skimming of black public high schools by white private high school to find the winning sportsmen they need. This film is a lot more than the story of a black teenager who finds his mentor, a father substitute since he has no father and his elder brother is not the model he wants, in a famous and yet totally marginal writer, Scottish by origin and bird-loving by choice and passion. This film is a lot more than the exacting tyrant a failed writer can become when he decides to compensate his failure in writing by becoming a creative writing and literature teacher. And this film is also a lot more than the phenomenal emotional shock it is for an aging man, diagnosed with cancer, entirely solitary and marginalized to find by accident and the insistence on the side of the foundling, the younger man who is going to be his follow-up next generation. He gets out of his cocoon. He gets out of his seclusion. Even so much that he will save his foundling from academic probation and even open up the door to his future. This film is all that together and a lot more. It is the story of loyalty, commitment and yet betrayal and salvation. Deeply emotional all along the film gets to a poignant ending when the death of the older man is announced by a lawyer to the younger man, and when this younger man is given the full legacy of the older man: the keys to the older man's den and sanctuary in the Bronx, a final farewell manuscript letter and the manuscript of his second and posthumous novel to be prefaced by the younger man. The racial problem is dealt with delicately but thoroughly showing how little race has to do with creative imagination, or even plain human love, but also that it has a lot to do with some preconceived ideas that a black basket ball player cannot be a creative writer of any excellence. A film to watch several times just for fun and emotional inspiration. You can always trace and track all the visual or situational allusions to many other films, like Matt Damon as a young lawyer. I have seen that somewhere else. Solve the many riddles of the type like the older man on his old fashioned bike cycling to the private school to save his black younger friend from ostracism and rejection. He just misses a black gown flying around him.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Vincennes Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Val de Marne Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID.watch several times just for fun and emotional inspiration.

1416583408|3.0|I never received the book that was ordered, so it is hard to give a review. I had to reorder from another seller.
B000ZELISO|5.0|I've given this product 5 stars for the entire package, and not the movie only.  As a movie, \\"Half-Blood Prince\\", is the best in the series since \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" and \\"Goblet of Fire\\".  Granted for the fans who have read the books as well, there are plenty of glaring omissions that take away from the story.  It's safe to say there will be a lot of making up to do in the \\"Deathly Hallows\\" films.<br /><br />Still it is a great movie.  David Yates has done an excellent job of directing.  It is much better than his first installment in the series \\"Order of ther Phoenix.\\"  My only quip with him as a director, is that he seems to shy away from the action scenes and go all out on the emotion and feeling.  Emotion is a key element of the series, but so is the action and thrill sequences.<br /><br />The strongest element of Yates' direction is the acting.  \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" and \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" have arguably the best acting in the series, and it is a joy to watch in this film.<br /><br />My final score for the movie itself is 4 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Now on to why the package gets 5 stars.  First of all it is a 3 disc package.  The Blu-Ray movie, the Blu-Ray Special Features disc, and the DVD movie.  So it has very high accesibility.  If you don't have a Blu-Ray at the current moment, you can still watch it on your DVD player while waiting to upgrade.  The Special Features disc, like with most of the Harry Potter DVDs, is PHENOMENAL!  The HP series always seems to hit grandslams with their special features.  One of the features included is a 2 minute preview of the \\"Deathly Hallows.\\"<br /><br />Finally there is an option for a Digital Copy.  With all of this, it makes \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" one of the best Blu-Ray/DVD packages around.
1423101472|5.0|I am in my 60's and I have just finished reading the Percy Jackson series.  I read the Harry Potter books and my college aged son was reading the first of this series.  I picked up the book when he went back to school and in two weeks I had finished the whole series.  I  know this is a young adult series, but I can't see why it should be limited to just them. I know that this series closely follows the Potter formula but it takes a back seat to no one.  This is a great series.  The dept of characters and the villians, non- god ones, is a surprise for what I thought would be quick read.  The back ground knowledge needed about the Greek gods helps, but the reader soon is given a lesson in Greek mythology that rivals those given in high school English classes and some collge classes.  The last book in this series contains a battle that I would love to see on the big screen.  It is the equal of a Mathew Reily battle and those who have read that series know how good those are.  In short this is a worth while read and one to give to others to read.  Any age can enjoy this. so enjoy!
B001HC7XCS|1.0|The DVD sent was in the Korean language, to disvcover this  the seals had to be opened therefore not retunable.
0385504225|3.0|I read Da Vinci Code and Angels/Demons and they were excellent. This is a good read - not great, but good. The adventures and historical clues are similar two the other two books and sometime in DC I'd be interested in checking these locales out. I felt the plot started a little slow, but the pace picked up quite a bit and didn't want to put it down. The climax of the book was surprising/excellent, however the conclusion was flat and uninspiring. The religious references were clever yet the lack of detail to explain such references was a letdown, as if Dan Brown didn't quite know where to go with them once he brought them up.
B0029LHW68|2.0|...would have been a better name for this album. When heard the title of 30 Seconds to Mars latest release my mind anticipated relenting songs of power, energy and force. But what I discovered was a release that in so many ways is the musical equivalent of the \\"Star Wars - Phantom Menace.\\" \\"This is war\\" is very \\"menace\\" like in the way that the songs are very long, drawn out and not very entertaining. There are also some various effects that are meant to enhance the music that make little impression on the listen audience. In addition the continuous chanting and harmonizing by the fans that are featured in songs like \\"Kings and Queens\\" and \\"Vox Populi\\" are very Jar Jar Binks like in that they are interesting the first time you hear them and completely obnoxious from there on out.       It is not like the album is completely terrible; I enjoyed \\"Night of the Hunter\\", \\"Hurricane\\" and \\"100 Suns\\". But to be fair none of these songs were in the same league as any of their songs on \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" or their self titled release.     In a way that is one of the reasons why I am so disappointed, because I truly cherish 30 Seconds to Mars. Their creativity is often invigorating and I really identified with the personal struggles and growth that were entrenched throughout \\"A Beautiful Lie.\\" \\"This war\\" contains no personal element and more to the point it feels like they got too chummy with top 40 radio. It was as if they hope sacrificing power chords in their songs would net them an additional million in record sales.     Ultimately, I can't recommend this album. It garners only two stars, one for their creativity and another because the band is very fan friendly. (See the Faces of Mars Campaign.) If you're like me and you're a long time fan just download the songs you find you like and forget the rest.
0307269981|5.0|I have been reading for almost six decades and have read thousands of books.  This is the first time I couldn't wait to read the next in a series and used Amazon U.K. to order the books prior to the US release date. I am driving all my friends nuts because I keep recommending this series to them.  Now it is your turn, read this series because it is just that good.<br />I have read all three books and while I enjoyed each one, this book is my favorite simply because Lisbeth Salander is arguably the best female character of the 21st century.  Do yourself a favor and read all three books in order.  You'll enjoy them.
B002PMV9FG|2.0|This movie wasn't too bad.  It did deviate from the book some.  It's a darker movie than the others.  If you read some of the other reviews posted here, they'll be more thorough in detailing what was left out of the movie version, than the book.      *** BUT THE ONE THING THAT ANNOYED ME THE MOST, WAS THE FORCED PREVIEWS YOU HAD TO SIT THROUGH AND WATCH BEFORE THE DVD MENU WOULD COME UP.***  YOU COULDN'T FAST FORWARD OR SKIP ANY OF THE THEM, OR GO TO THE DISK'S MENU.    There were about a dozen previews for the multiple video games, theme amusement park, and other movie previews.      This will be the first Harry Potter movie I won't buy because of this annoying feature (what a major pain in the you know what!).       - Disgruntled Fan

B000PC0SPU|3.0|I never would have chosen to read this book on my own accord. It was assigned for a class (which I found rather strange since it did not directly correlate with the subject, since it is a more of a business book than anything else). Still, I did enjoy it more than I thought it would. In the style of [[ASIN:0060731338 Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (P.S.)]], the majority of its facts were anecdotal and fascinating. Suggested activities and websites made it an interactive and modern book.
B002R68U7K|3.0|OK, so I was about ready to hit \\"BUY\\" for this box set, then I thought about something. I am a huge fan of packaging and marketing... THIS being the reason I wanted to slam 70 USD down on this product. But let's take a look at the reasonableness behind actually owning this. Each CD has only two tracks. Just think of how annoying that would be, trying to listen to the entire box set straight through. The answer to that is simple: VERY. And in a day and age where all CD's are almost worth nothing at used CD shops, we would probably take the two hours to upload all the tracks, most of which we HAD already, to our iTunes. Then where does this 70 USD... I'm sorry... \\"Box set\\" go? On our dresser? In our closet after a month of taking up room on your desk? Unfortunately for me, yes. That or I'd re-sell it for a LOT less on Amazon or Ebay as a used item. Hey maybe that's what I will do- Just wait a month and buy it used for 30 USD from someone who DIDN'T read my review! Wala! My venting about this sweet looking collection has now saved me 40 USD which I can now use for something WAY more relevant: Maybe taking a family member out to dinner. Yeah. Good idea. You should do the same. Trust me.  Happy Holidays to all!
0142000671|5.0|What a poignant and precise book. Despite this book's classic reputation, I never read this in school, and really had no idea what the book was about. I really enjoyed it - and was truly shocked by how sad it was. I felt terrible after reading the ending and was surprised at how such a short book could cover such huge themes like isolation, friendship, love, death and dreams. The number of dogs were surprising, too. I liked it more than [[ASIN:014200068X Cannery Row: (Centennial Edition)]].
B002T921DE|5.0|Alright I have to say that people should listen to a bluray or dvd before they write a review and say that it is not good enough.  One person on [...] said that this concert on blu doesnt sound right and that there is too much bass and distortion.  Well I have to say is if you think this concert will sound good on a $200 Home Theater in a box then your wrong.  I am using Definitive Technology Mythos Seven and a Supercube III via an Onkyo 606 and I have no distortion, rather it is the best sounding bluray concert  to date so far.  If you use cheap speakers and amps, this will not work the way it was meant to be.    So for everyone next time you write a review and have anything negative to say check your equippment if it can handle it otherwise please dont write anything.    All I can say is that this concert is the best in video and audio quality, especially the DTS HD MA soundtrack.    Thank God they released it on blu-ray.    If you like George Michael do yourself a favor and buy it no matter how much the cost.    Enjoy!

B000HBK3MM|4.0|Corinne Bailey Rae has a gorgeous voice.  However, she needs to find songs that are a little more varied - after the third song, the rest of the album sounded the same.  Her voice is exquisite.  What this artist needs is better songs written just for her voice and style.<br /><br />I look forward to hearing her new album when it comes out.
B001CDLATE|5.0|The critical Amazon reviews of this have been thoroughly fascinating and illustrative of the range of intellect in our online consumer culture. This variation spans psychology and intellect, from a large group of viewers who felt the filmmaker was pushing a message about the evils of modern society to those that found his message too shallow and merely voyeuristic. Some were lost without the structure of narration or plot line. Amazon has included many reviews critical of the transfer and encoding, which were for the original, out-of-print, poorly-transferred DVD version under the listing for the Blu-Ray version, which is truly stunning.  There is a negative review by a technology freak who has built himself a home theater and refined his technical knowledge beyond being able to enjoy a thing of beauty.<br /><br />To these people I say: try turning off you're your feelings of inadequacy and stop projecting your own fears and discomfort onto the joy of experience and wonder. Although not beyond criticism, this disc offers you an uncommon opportunity to peer into a window of experience unlike any other. Several of the Reggio films were great, and Frick has continued along that path with his own, alternate vision, refining and expanding the theme of using visual transport to a spiritual realm; looking at our world in a way that transcends time and mere cultural associations. Try looking at these images as wonders of the world from the eyes of a child, where even the most base modern practice is revealed as a thing of beauty through the lens of this amazing custom-made camera. Yes, there is juxtaposition here between the sublime and the banal, pointing a direction as well as contrasting a level of spiritual action which has come to us from our ancestors, no matter who we are. It is the filmmaker's opinion, as any film is.<br /><br />Besides being beautiful, this disc is technically the best quality photographic reproduction I have seen in the Blu-Ray medium. nothing I have seen even comes close.
B001PPLIEG|1.0|I am unsure of how many persons read these things, but I hope they read some of the NEGITIVE ONES before \\"wasting their money\\". These are harsh terms but Quantum of Solace was a complete disaster. i HAVE COLLECTED all of the Bond videos but this one is not up to par. All most all of the \\"action scenes\\"  were so blurry and played back at such a high speed to simulate struggles they were unwatchable. Who was the director and firm editor that they would allow blurry scene in 40% of the movie? I will say no more, rent it maybe, buy it never!!!
B002N1AEN2|3.0|There are a few pretty nice songs here, making the most of breathy vocals and spare electronic backing, though for my taste, too many of the songs are draggingly slow.  But the dealbreaker about this band is Oliver Sim's singing.  There is a drab, toneless quality to his voice, and he cannot sing on key (mostly flat).  His vocalizing definitely detracts and distracts from the overall effect.  He should abdicate vocals and leave them in the capable hands of his bandmate Romy Madley Croft, who, alone, could make this concept work.
B0001CTJCC|4.0|I am not sure if Zappa knew this was his last tour but he was sure acting so. He formed a big band. These musicians were at least as good as the 1973-75 band, but 1980s sampling and digital instruments gave them an edge.<br /><br />He had this band learn almost his entire catolouge. This double set covers the rock material, while [[ASIN:B0000009TK Make a Jazz Noise Here]] encompaasses more abstract compositions. [[ASIN:B0000009TI Broadway the Hard Way]] covers more theatrical material.<br /><br />Tracks ranging from \\"Heavy Duty Judy,\\" \\"Inca Roads\\" and \\"Who Needs The Peace Corps\\" are here, along with an improptu cover of Johnny Cash's \\"Ring Of Fire.\\" The sound of the band with their modern equiptment is so massive, earlier versions sound malnourished. Zappa's guitar work has a density and abstraction that may make this the best axe work of his career.<br /><br />This and the other two CDs will give you over six hours of music from the 1988 tour.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|If you are a Star Trek Fan - you are certainly biased enough to go buy this Blu-ray DVD. Content is pretty good - what I liked is the fact that I can download the movie into my iphone via itunes and the price that Amazon sells it is one of the best prices to be found right now.
B000001DYA|5.0|There was a riot going on in 1968, and it was called Vincebus Eruptum. Hendrix may have fused volume with blues and jazz, and the MC5 may have staged a punk insurrection. But no one rocked harder than Blue Cheer.<br /><br />\\"Summertime Blues\\" turns Eddie Cochran's rockabilly into a mosh frenzy. \\"Out Of Focus\\" is a head in the vice fever dream, and \\"Rock Me Baby\\" may have been the heaviest take on the blues in rock yet.<br /><br />Blue Cheer were not the kids marching, or going to college. They were the guys that would have worked in a machine shop, smoked lots of weed, drank lots of beer, and grown their hair, stedily. This was music for the kids in the steel towns, doomed to factory jobs, and the songs punched as hard as these kids could,<br /><br />No politics, no protest, no power flowers. This is heavy metel before metel was heavy. GET IT.

0596527055|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book, it was a quick light-hearted read. While I didn't learn anything earth-shattering, it was a nice way to pass a few hours and to inspire a bit of brain-storming. The author did try to inject humour in his writing, but much of it came across as rather cheesy.    If that is what you're after, then this book is fine. If you're after something more serious, then I would suggest looking elsewhere.    The author doesn't appear to have done any real research aside from surfing the web and chatting to people in bars. The book reads more like a personal blog of somebody who spends a lot of time reading about innovation. About half of the books \\"citations\\" were to web-pages (many of which are now dead links).    Overall this book comes across as an earnest attempt by a \\"pro-am\\". I suspect that it would have made for a great blog if the author turned each chapter into a post; but as a book it just feels cheesy and lacking real substance or authority.    I would have given it only one or two stars on the basis of the content, if not for the fact that the light-hearted tone made it enjoyable to read. So, overall, it's \\"Okay\\".

B0026S7JQ2|1.0|THIS STAND IS DANGEROUS. DO NOT TRUST IT TO SUPPORT YOUR LAPTOP.     This stand loses grip over time. A few nights ago, I watched (in slow motion horror accompanied by a classic muffled/panicked \\"nooooooooooo....\\" for added effect) as my macbook pro slid off the stand and onto my kitchen floor. The laptop was fully on the stand prior to sliding off. After that, the laptop wouldn't boot.     I took my laptop to the Apple store to have it diagnosed. My hard drive was broken because of the fall. This was not all. I now have a big dent on my laptop and a ding in my kitchen floor.     I called Griffin Technology to see what they could do for me. They said that since the stand was more than 2 months old that it was not a manufacturing defect and that they would be unable to cover the cost of the replacement hard drive and shell. The hard drive and new torx set cost over $120. I don't even want to guess how much a new macbook pro shell would cost me.    It is concerning that Griffin believes that a $30+ stand which supports a multi-thousand dollar computer should only be stable for one to two months.    I spent the next day dissembling my laptop, installing a new hard drive, attempting to bend my laptop shell back into shape, reassembling my laptop, restoring OS-X and the environment that I had on the computer.     I should have trusted my first instinct to not buy products from Griffin.
0061730327|5.0|The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind was the most inspirational book I've picked up in a long time.  I've been following the story of William Kamkwamba since I first stumbled across his blog some time ago.  He's a truly impressive individual whose hand built electricity-generating windmill has made waves around the world especially among those interested in renewable energy.<br /><br />I was under the impression that William's book would be geared toward the environmental/renewable energy crowd, but as I got deeper into the story I realized that the message really speaks to anyone who desires to make a difference.  In William's words, \\"If you want to make it, all you have to do is try\\".  From start to finish, I was inspired by William's recounting of his family, his community, his perseverance, and the enthusiasm with which he pursues a better life for his family and his homeland.  It's not necessarily a book about renewable energy, but instead it's a book about how vision can transform the world we live in.<br /><br />The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind tells William's story from the famine that inadvertently prompted his dreams of an \\"electric wind\\" to the media storm that took him around the world to share his dream with the world.  The truly amazing part of this story is its characters and the depth of human emotion portrayed as William works toward a better life for his family.  Drifting away from my preconceptions about the book, the story focuses less on the environmental improvements that can come with renewable energy and more on the dramatic quality of life changes it can bring for those living in developing countries.<br /><br />I think William has one of the most important messages that we can hear.  His story shows how we must follow our visions in spite of the obstacles that lay in our path.  There is also a clear message about learning how the changes needed for our families and our communities come through a cycle of giving.  This book demonstrates that we are both the solutions to our problems as well as the limitations that prevent those solutions from being manifested.<br /><br />I found the insightful perspective through which William saw the world to be both entertaining and informative.  William and co-author do a beautiful job in explaining the culture of Malawi (William's homeland) while showing both the tragedies and pleasure of life there.  I also enjoyed learning about the mechanics of wind power production and its potential beyond a renewable energy source.  This is a must read for anyone who finds themselves in a rut toward achieving their dreams of a better world or anyone who simply wants to be inspired by what can be done to change life for the better armed with nothing more than passion.our problems as well as the limitations that prevent those solutions from being manifested.

0756405890|4.0|This lengthy fantasy novel introduces the story of Kvothe, a gypsy boy turned orphaned street urchin turned student and prodigy in magic. Actually, he's a prodigy in everything else he attempts as well: language, music, and the list goes on. He also possesses few if any moral flaws (besides arrogance, but the author doesn't seem to recognize that one). Sure, he makes mistakes, but they're of the impulsive-youth variety, easily forgivable.<br /><br />Mary Sue? Let me count the ways. Not only is Kvothe omni-skilled and morally justified, he's also the victim of childhood tragedy, of desperate poverty, of snubs at the University. He's driven to avenge his family, who were killed by the Chandrian (uber-demons who may or may not exist according to his world's society--of course, we know they do). He's witty, all the time. He sings breathtaking baritone. He's a redhead.<br /><br />However, the wish-fulfillment nature of the hero isn't the worst part of this book. That honor falls to the prose itself. The dialogue isn't bad, but it sometimes comes across awfully, thanks to profusions of adverbs and direct address. The narrative style can be artful, but it can also be melodramatic and author-indulgent. One gets the definite feeling that Mr. Rothfuss is impressed with his own diction. In addition, characterization of the supporting cast leans on quite a few types (wise old teacher; waif/free spirit love interest; entitled rich kid antagonist; devoted sidekick/servant).<br /><br />Not many four-star reviews list more minus than plus points, but I'm a character reader. I want to feel something for these fictional people. If I don't, literary brilliance isn't going to win more than three stars. If I do, well ... I occasionally end up with a review like this one. Frame narrative is used brilliantly here to give us glimpses of a mysteriously broken Kvothe, telling his tale in the present. How did he become this way? None of the book's literary flaws negate my need to find out. I can't wait for the second installment, which will obviously give us less setup and more payoff.<br /><br />Kvothe, Extraordinaire In Everything, is the most enjoyable Mary Sue I've ever read.  I'm curious how he'll evolve from the student of Book One's chronicle, to the warrior we know he'll become, to the broken innkeeper in the \\"now\\" of the frame narrative, telling his own story.  I care about what's in store for him; whatever it is, I want him to heal from it.  When his story is told, when Chronicler sets down his pen and the scraelings descend at the end of Day Three (surely that's the plan?), I want this arrogant, ridiculously flawless guy to win the day.can't wait for the second installment, which will obviously give us less setup and more payoff.<br /><br />Kvothe, Extraordinaire In Everything, is the most enjoyable Mary Sue I've ever read.

B00000JNNY|4.0|The name Etta James is no stranger to this space. Whether it is in reference to the classic Chicago blues label Chess Records, Chicago blues as a genre, or just Etta rockin' the house I have found time to place her in that rather small (unfortunately) number of great modern female blues singers. That said, this CD has plenty of that, but also showcases her other talents. Although this album started life as a Chess production (of some sort) there are ballads and other old time tunes here to show that in her prime there was nothing Etta couldn't cover with gusto. Some of it like \\"Trust In Me\\" is just a little too sweet for me. I called it \\"bubblegum\\" music in the old days. But compare that to her covers of famous classic Lena Horne \\"Stormy Weather\\" or \\"Sunday Kind of Love\\" and you have an approximation of what the songs were that we listened to when thoughts of love were first bubbling up around 1960. And easy music to ask a girl or guy to slow dance too. Ah, well.
B001AVCFK6|3.0|The three disc version of Star Trek is amazing, video and sound quality is absolutely amazing. If you see alot of glare in the actual movie don't worry. Its the camera man J.J employed to shoot the movie, great filming quality but alot of flashing glare in some parts but all in all very amazing video, better filming than the last three Star Wars movies anyways and better than Transformers. I would appreciate however if Amazon had shipped me the version with the mini star trek ship, i think it is neat as a purchaser has shown in the pictures section. I guess Walmart beat them to it and bought out all those version cause they were on sale for 19.99 on Black Friday. Anyways i am very pleased with the shipping and service from Amazon way to go!

B000PUXCQY|2.0|This is a great concert! I saw it aired back in 2004 when it was first recorded. So I was excited to see that it was available for download. Unfortunately, this file they're selling for $9.99 only contains the first half of the show! As the file is ending you can even hear the announcer telling the crowd that there will be a 15 minute intermission before the next set...What a letdown. There's a really cool part of this concert where the band does more acoustic versions of Owner of a Lonely Heart and Roundabout, and they're not included in this download. So do yourself a favor and order the DVD. You won't regret it!

B002VECM6I|5.0|The Blindside is the definition of what an inspirational movie should be. It INSPIRES you. I've seen so many films that are suppose to inspire you but fail to do so. This film will make you want to help someone. The Blindside is the story of a poor homeless youth named Micheal Oher who is taken in by this wealthy white family. It's amazing how much this family changed this young mans life just by caring. This movie will definately move you. Sandra Bullock once again shows why she is one of the best actresses in Hollywood. She delivers a wonderful performance. I'm not going into detail about this film because i want everyone to see this. I did not expect much from this movie. I didn't even no what it was going to be about. However, It was an experience that i will not soon forget. I give the Blindside a 5 STAR RATING and TWO THUMBS UP, and no i do not do this very often. Please go out and see this movie and pick it up when it comes out on dvd. HOLLA!

0385504225|3.0|I really love Dan Brown, I love Robert Langdon and the whole concept.  This has been my most eagerly awaited book ever and unfortunately it has also been the biggest let down.  Yes, it was basically The Da Vinci Code set in Washington DC, but I was ok with that.  I was ok with it being almost the same plot, basically the same leading lady, same tweed jacket.  What I wasn't ok with was the extra 150 pages of added fluff in the middle of the book and the extra 50 pages at the end.  The story seemingly ends and wraps up and for some reason the main characters continue on like nothing ever happened.  I am being very careful not to give anything away here, but just know, you can basically skip 50% of this book and still get a very good picture of what happened.  Not that I did, I slogged through all 500 pages until I got to the end and then, just like the last Lord of the Rings, it continued and when it did finally end I was left feeling like I got cheated.  He should have ended it on page 450, not 500.  I'm still a fan and I'll still race to buy the next Langdon book.  But I hope he has learned a lesson with The Lost Symbol.  I am not the only one feeling this way.

Anyways, I said all that to say that even my least favorite album of his is still pretty sweet. This cd is kinda like continuum, a little lighter and fluffier. I gave it four stars because I love to hear him play the guitar, and there aren't many nice long riffs on this album.

I ended up seeing this musical 2 more times at different places. I don't think I can watch another musical the same way because there will always be WICKED to compare with. anyway.. We listen to this CD quite often with warm remembrances. Buy It.. you would NOT be disappointed.
B001VLXNLU|1.0|This book was 2 dollars for the Kindle for a reason. I couldn't make it past Chapter 2. The main character used the word \\"turd\\". Whether you're looking for a Twilight type of fix or just wanting a good book, this will NOT be the solution. Don't waste the time or money!
B002N1AERI|5.0|I have roughly 160 Gigs of Metal/Rock/Death/Black Metal/Industrial/Symphonic/Goth etc all collected over the last 10 years or so, and nothing I have ever heard can in my opinion hold a candle to this album.  I have never felt the need to write a review about music, after listening this a couple times I couldn't stay away from writing about it.    This album is bombastic to the extreme in a way that makes other attempts seem silly, however it pulls it of the flawless execution. It is so deeply layered with a multitude of sounds and flawlessly pulls off grunt vs harmony that I can't fault any of the main songs (the ballads are not my style, of which there are only 2 on this album).    As a musician myself I can appreciate the intricacies of blending an orchestra, choir, and female fronted death metal band, and doing it well.  It is very well done, the transitions are fluid and dynamic.  There is quite a bit of mixing major and minor for a dark yet inspiring and powerful sound, especially when the orchestra stays major and the electronic strings all go minor, then layer in Simon over the top with her unbelievable vocals that have an incredible range of style and sound, and it comes together in an album that does not fit in a little package of \\"symphonic metal\\" or any other label, it defies it, and it does it well.    I think why it strikes me as so unbelievable is that it takes so many components of all the different various types of rock/metal/etc that I listen to and combines it into one band with extremely complex songs that still have enough accessibility to be enjoyable. Epica doesn't go off roaming on technical timing or odd off beat breaks to prove they can do it, they do it, but that is not the focal point, the focus is the balance of Simon and everything else in harmony. Yes, it has honest to god Harmony.      In the same way that certain classical pieces can inspire very strong emotional reactions in people who truly appreciate them, Epica can inspire the same, and oddly enough, Kingdom of Heaven, a near 14 minute song, can swing emotion all over as it twists and turns through power portions and then flows back into a darker death sound.    All that said, if you like complex, strong music that you can listen multiple times and pick out new things for quite a few listens, this album is for you, though, if you want something that you will hear on the radio and be \\"cool\\" , this isn't it, they will never get air time, it's too much for the general public to consume.    Forget 5 stars is a 10/10 :)
B00164GDD2|3.0|I would think technology had reached a point where cleaning up the graininess would have been a problem long passed, but apparently it isn't. The BR version is just as grainy as the DVD version. As a matter of fact, if you're looking to buy the blu ray version in hopes of it being better than the DVD version, don't waste your money. The DVD version is the same if not better than the blu ray version. It is sad, because this movie is one of my all time favorites. It is a classic, but very disappointed with the blu ray transfer.

B001VPJYZK|4.0|Season five was far superior to the current season six, so far. Centering on six gorgeous women, many of the episodes hit emotional highs by a mix of intelligent dialog and summation narration. One episode in particular - I think that it was #13 entitled \\"The Best Thing That Ever Could Have Happened\\" - was worth the price of admission alone. It was heart-wrenching throughout, centering on a handyman's life and his influence upon the lives of the six leading ladies. My wife and I had missed the whole season and bought this to catch up, and we were very glad we did. Especially after that episode.
076535618X|5.0|For my time and money, I think \\"The Last Colony\\" is his best work since \\"The A Dream\\"  It had everything.  Action, great great diaolgue, and wonderful political cloke and dagger.  It is true that I did not like Zoe's Tale quite as much but between this and \\"METAtropolist\\" (is that right?, I don't have it in front of me)I am going to be a fan until he proves otherwise.  Well done John!!
B000065V42|4.0|I have no idea how long ago I watched this on The Disney Channel, and taped it onto a video and watched it umpteen times. Just recently, I was able to afford it on DVD and thoroughly enjoyed it once again. Inventor Wayne is having trouble with his shrinking machien that seems to blow things up until a neighbor boy hits a bseball through the attic wiindow, which lands in an area where the machine's beam pierces it, and suddenly objects become tiny, including both familes' sons and daughters. Thus begins a wild trek across the backyard encountering huge butterflies, bees, an ant and a scorpion. Both sets of parents fantically search for their children, unaware until later what has happened to them. Now Wayne, who had smashed his shrinking machine before knowing what it had accomplished, now has to put it back together so he can return the children to full size. The four kids try out a number of ways to get home, such as trying to hitch a ride on the family dog. I felt the kids looked very real to me in their tiny size, and found the large-scale objects they were filmed with very convincing. I had great fun watching it and know others will as well.
0140306013|4.0|My wife says, \\"order it\\", so I ordered it. I've never read the book and this ones a gift for a grandchild. My wife says it's one of the best books she ever read as a child. Beyond that, it's what I expected.
B0001I55SS|3.0|I'm no fan of remakes, but \\"The Black Hole\\" sure could use one. The \\"Vincent\\" and \\"Bob\\" bots are among the most ridiculous ever - obviously & childishly ripped off from Star Wars. They look like rejects from Sesame Street. Although BH got a PG rating, Disney didn't seem to know whether to \\"upscale\\" it for older audiences or dumb it down for the kiddies. They settled for the latter, resulting in a confused mishmash lurching from compelling to idiotic.    Replacing those dumb bots with Tom Servo & Crow would be a vast improvement.
1400063736|5.0|Finally a novel that meets all the ridiculous expectations and merits all the awards. McCann is an artist and a craftsman, with an uncanny ability to use language and meter and structure to project intense emotion. He deeply inhabits his broad cast of characters, giving them the not-always-overlapping gifts of life and humanity. He also illuminates New York City from its gritty, mean, harder-to-love past, before Disney and New Urbanism and Giuliani and Sex And the City revitalized it. Push past an opening chapter that feels weaker and less lively than the rest of the story; it is a necessary foundation, if sometimes less deft than the brilliance that follows.
B001YB29HG|5.0|I have loved pretty much everything Joss Whedon has ever done, but he and his cohorts have outdone themselves with this!  It is pure genius!  The people are awesome and perform their parts fantastically!  The music is catching and you will find yourself humming it all the time.  If you like something that requires you to think outside the box then this is for you!  Enjoy!!
B001MYIXAC|4.0|First of all, sorry with my english as i am french. I do my best with the grammar errors.<br /><br />The criticism over the supposedly bad subtitles is clearly, what we call in french, a tempest (or a storm) within a glass of water. Much ado over nothing.<br /><br />If you are going to keep yourself from seeing this great film because of the subtitles, you are depriving yourself from one great experience.<br /><br />C'mon you guys!<br /><br />Are you all little children? Do we need to hold you by the hand? Are you so childish that you can't get pass poor translations?<br /><br />I've seen the famous blog site that every one is talking about where one person who clearly has too much free time on his hands compares two versions of the film with two versions of subtitles. Yes, there are differences. Even one that is sad (the morse code one with the word \\"s.w.e.e.t.\\" being one of them).<br /><br />But you know what?<br /><br />It does not matter! You nerds! If you're watching foreign films, it means that you are willing to have these margins of errors in the translations. How d'ya know for sure that your \\"right\\" version of the subtitles is the closest to the real film? Unless you speak swedish? If you're watching foreign films with subtitles, it means that you're a true movie lover, even a so-called \\"intellectual\\" of cinema. It then means that you're an educated person, probably even intelligent. Well then, it means that you are aware of the different mind set that is required whenever watching a foreign film with subtitles. You know darn well that you are going to be missing important aspects of the dialogue. From language to language, meanings differ and expressions are not always the same. When you watch a foregin film, you are suppose to prepare yourself mentally. You are suppose to open your mind a little bit more. You are suppose to let yourself be absorbed by the general atmosphere of a scene rather then by every little choices of words.<br /><br />If there weredifferences, i don't feel like i've missed anything. I got the point of the movie anyway. And i'm not better than anyone else.<br /><br />I'm french (from Montréal) and i watch a lot of french films from Europe and from Québec (Canada). Sometimes, for the heck of it, i put on the  english subtitles just to see how much different the meanings are. Well, my friends, they are! But in general, you get it anyway.<br /><br />FCor examples, in \\"I Come In Peace\\" (with Dolph Lundgren), the bad alien keeps saying \\"I come in peace\\" before killing his victims. At the end, the hero kills him after saying \\"Well, you go in pieces!\\". In french, you can't do this play-of-word. Instead, the hero replies \\"well you will give us peace of mind\\". He says it in french of course and it does rhyme with \\"I come in peace\\" (in french). In \\"Running Man\\" with Arnold, he lifts a bad guy over his head and drops him by saying to him \\"Wanna lift?\\". In french, he says \\"Wanna play airplanes?\\" (in french, it's an expression we use). You know what? These replies are even more funny in french than they are in their original language and it doesn't really change the rythm of the scene. We \\"get it\\" anyway.<br /><br />To sum it up, don't listen the nerds who are boycotting this version of the film and buy it anyway. Don't miss this film. Believe me, you'll \\"get it\\". You won't be \\"lost\\". You'll probably even say \\"What the hell was that fuss all about?\\"<br /><br />After all, you are an intelligent person. You are watching a foreign film with subtitles. You know how to prepare for it. How to have the right mind set.
B001GCUO52|3.0|There are enough good reviews of the movie here for you to get an idea of whether you want to watch it or not.  For me, the movie was a good time.  Not much new going on from the first 3 in the series, but they had some new deaths which were well done in their own right.    I decided to post this review to inform people of the 3D BluRay version.  The disk itself has both the typical 2D version of the movie, and an Anaglyph 3D version.  For this reason, I have to say, do NOT buy this movie if you are expecting an amazing 3D experience.  Many of the scenes were shot with dominating red or blue hues which play havoc with the Anaglyph (red and blue lenses) 3D format.  Many scenes are more of a headache to watch in 3D than are justified by the addition of 3D.  You will find yourself taking off the glasses and switching to the 2D version of the film within the first 45 minutes.  If you were going to buy this movie based on the 3D experience, your money is better spent elsewhere.  For fans of the previous films, they will not be disappointed.    Soon enough the AVC-3D codec will be released and allow for polarized screens/glasses that don't destroy the colours in the film you are watching.  Until then, 3D Anaglyph blu-ray disks are just novelty, no more.

B001PO53IO|5.0|I find these more enjoyable than Episodes 1 - 3.  Anakin isn't annoying (imagine that) and you get George Takei as a villain in an episode!    It's much better in HD and w/o commercials (no Cartoon Network HD on our local Comcast and no Tivo).  Will definitely get season 2 when it comes out.      This is a must buy for any Star Wars fan with kids (or w/o if you're geeky enough ... joking).
0763631205|5.0|This book was purchased for our book club read and I love this version.  With big gorgeous full color pages the story pops from the pages.  This book was not purchased for a one time read, but as a book that I can keep on the shelf for years to come to be shared again and again.
B0029LHW68|5.0|It is impossible to put a review on this album; the album is, without a doubt, the best piece of work that has come out in years.  I wish this band all of the luck in the world.   Excellent job, 30STM.
0691142165|2.0|When I purchased this book I was expecting to learn about the various financial crisis through out history and the psycholgy that lead up to the crisis.  Instead I read a book that was mostly data.   Half of the book consists of tables and graphs, another 25 percent explains how the data was collected, and the last 25 percent explains what the data means.  The main points I took away from the book are the following:    1. Devaluing a currency is a form of default.  2. Countries in their initial and middle stages of development frequently default on their debt, while advance countries rarely, if ever default on debt, but if they do default they will devalue their currency, which will cause inflation.    3. Banking crisis are usually cased by large drops in home values.  4. It takes years for a country's economy to recover from a banking crisis.  5. During a banking crisis government debt will usually grow on average by 86 percent.    If you are an economics professor who loves to look at data you may enjoy this book, but the average reader will not.

B0002YCVXI|5.0|Of all of my CDs, this is the one that creates a reflective and meditative mood. A very deep and peaceful arrangement. Yo-Yo's best in my opinion. But thats just my opinion. Check it out for yourself. See what it does for you.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I first listened to the original LET IT BE album as a kid, and thought that it was strange, but excellent.  Today, I still feel that way about it.  Then, I listened to the LET IT BE...NAKED album and realized how much they 'cleaned up' the album.  It wasn't that the original album had any profanity in it.  It was just that they removed the dialouge and the musical sounds made by Phil Spector.  I think that this album is neither better, nor worse than the original album.  It's just different.    I read that Paul McCartney, as well as many critics and fans, was not pleased with the original album because he was not satisfied by the musical additions that Phil Spector made as well as the not-so-professional methods of the other songs (with all the laughing, false starts, and gibberish.)  Anyway, I probably don't have anything brilliant or innovative to say, considering that there are hundreds of other critiques about this album already, but I'd like to discuss the songs:      \\"Get Back\\"- This version is different in that it does not include any jokes or gibberish such as when John Lennon sings, \\"Sweet Loretta fart, she thought she was a cleaner\\" on the original version.  Moreover, unlike the version on the PAST MASTERS album, it does not include the ending where Paul says, \\"Get back Loretta. Your mama's waiting for ya...wearing her high heel shoes...and a low neck sweater.  Get back home Loretta.\\"  Even though this is left out the song still rocks.  I'm also glad that Billy Preston's piano solo was not edited from this version!    \\"I Dig a Pony\\"-The original version has a false start.  You don't hear it in this version.  Plus you don't hear any dialouge at the end of song as you do on the original version.  This is a well-arranged song with efficient and enjoyable guitar solos.    \\"For You Blue\\"-In the original version, you hear John say, \\"Queen says no to pot smoking...F.B.I. movies...\\"  You don't hear that here.  This George Harrison song is fairly easy-going, but atthe same time, not boring.    \\"The Long and Winding Road\\"-In the original version, you hear the over-the-top orchestral and choir arrangements by Phil Spector.  However, in this one, all of this is cut out.  It's more back-to-basics, and features a well-done electric organ solo by Billy Preston.    \\"Two of Us\\"-In the original version, you hear John cracking jokes prior to the beginning of the song.  In this version, it's left out.  This is a great easy-going ballad with great lyrics and instrument arrangements.    \\"I've Got a Feeling\\"-The version on this album is somewhat different than the one on the original album.  Paul shouts his vocals in areas which are different than the original version, you hear Billy's Preston's piano playing more clearly, and you don't hear any gibberish after the song ends.  This song is a well-written rocker.    \\"One After 909\\"-Here's another great rock 'n' roll song which is not too different from the original version.  The vocals are somewhat different throughout the song, and you don't hear the group sing the old British song, \\"Oh, Danny Boy\\" after the song ends.    \\"Don't Let Me Down\\"-Another well-written song by John, where the vocals are different on this version than on the original version.  You hear Billy Preton's brilliant piano playing as well as the great arrangement of the other instruments by all the Beatle members.    \\"I Me Mine\\"-Written by George, this is an exellent version, without the choirs and orchestral arrangements of Phil Spector on the original version.  It should also be noted that John was the only member not present during the recording of this song.    \\"Across the Universe\\"-This version is different from both the original album version as well as another version featured on another album called, NO ONE'S GONNA CHANGE OUR WORLD, which was a charity album released back in February, 1968 for the World Wildlife Fund.  On the version, released on the charity album, you hear bird sound effects, two girls singingchoir backgrounds, and well as additional vocals.  On the original LET IT BE version, you hear all of these features removed and hear choir and orchestral arrangements provided by Phil Spector.  Whereas, on this version, you hear John playing his guitar and singing.  (His voice is not overdubbed like on the other two versions).  Plus you hear echoing at the end of the song as well as some sound effects.  This is a moving version which is well-arranged.    \\"Let It Be\\"-This version is different from the original album version in that it does not have some of the orchestral arrangements provided by Phil Spector.  You hear the vocals and Billy Preston's organ playing more clearly.  Also, George plays a different guitar solo from the original album version and the version a the PAST MASTERS album.  Along with that, there is no extra verse at the end of the song, unlike the version on the original LET IT BE album.  The version here like the other two is sensational.    There's an additional disc called, FLY ON THE WALL, which features The Beatles at work and rehearsal for this album.  You hardly hear any shoutings or arguments.  Obviously, there were plenty of tensions and fights taking place during the making of this album.  I suppose the makers of this album thought that if us fans listened to tensions going on, we would be overwhelmed, but that's just my point of view.  This is nevertheless and interesting and enjoyable disk to listen to.    This CD set also features a booklet:  One part consists of an essay by Kevin Howlett in which he gives his view about the making of LET IT BE.  It's well-written and interesting.  The other part of the booklet features sections of The Beatles making discussions and cracking jokes while at work during rehearsal and during the studio sessions.  They are very amusing.      Well, after all that has been said about and done to this album, I think that this is an excellent album done on a more professional level.  Once again, I don't think it's necessarily better than the original LET IT BE album or the GET BACK single released previosuly.  However, it is great for your Beatles' collection.  Well, there you have it.  Draw your own conclusions!

B002GJT4XW|5.0|To start off this isn't a review of the movie itself, by now you should have already formed an opinion of the movie for yourself or from other reviews of just the film.  This is a review for the Ultimate Edition.    Two words:  Absolutely Amazing!    This isn't just some scam from Warner Bros to get a few more dollars squeezed out of the Harry Potter movies, this is brand new and refreshing.  Warner Bros packaged this set to be (or what appears to be) the last Harry Potter set to be had.  Everything that you could want in a collectors set it included here.    The booklet included is surprisingly well done.  The book keeps with the theme of the special feature exclusive to the ultimate edition.  For example, in the Chamber of Secrets edition the booklet is all about the characters and their development, both at the beginning of the series and how they have evolved through the years.  Included are stills from the movie, pictures of the theme (ie. characters, buildings, sets), and my favorite... concept art.    As for the character cards that are included they aren't anything super special but at the same time they aren't cheaply done.  The cards are solid and printed well.  I could see where some people will find them very satisfying and a highlight of the edition.    The thing that I was most impressed with, however, was the presentation.  Finally someone released a special edition of a film and made it presentable and convenient.  The boxes are made to look like books that fold open and are neatly packed on the inside.  Also on the inside of the book there are images from the film, making it look very much like a collector's item.  Warner Bros has really set themselves up nicely for the release of the next six of these.      Overall I was extremely pleased with this edition of the movie and cannot wait for the rest to be released.
0061537934|4.0|Huge dog lover here.  Cried at the end when Enzo died, even though during much of the book he annoyed me. (That's not a spoiler: he's dying on page 1.)  Not using contractions when you speak doesn't necessarily make you wise.  Also, too much race car driving for me, and I thought the long, long racing metaphor overwhelmed the book.    Still, I'll read any book about a dog.

0307454541|4.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is intended to be a mystery, but it isn't too mysterious. Certainly, some details are suprising, but overall, most of the plot is predictable hundreds of pages beforehand. Despite this, the author keeps it interesting and leads the reader into rooting for the main characters.<br /><br />There is plenty of content to earn an R rating. Apparently, the author was trying to make a point with that content that could have been done much more plainly.<br /><br />Anyway, by midway through the book, I didn't want to put it down.
1906694168|5.0|I had read \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tatoo\\" first, on my Kindle. It took a bit to get into the book, but once that I did, I couldn't put it down; because, it so thoroughly set the stage of the characters and a story line that dominated the entire book. I could not wait to download \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\".<br /><br />This book was even better than the first. The fast pace and interesting characters, who had continued from the first book, kept me glued to these pages. In fact, when I finished this book, in two days, I was rather depressed, thinking that there would not be a continuation of these characters, in any other book. I was shocked to see that there was yet another book to read, that did continue the saga of the main character in the books.<br /><br />Oh no! When I read that the third book would not be released in the United States until May of 2010, I was beside myself. I then saw that I could, in fact, order it from a source in England. I did that immediately through Amazon, and received the book within two weeks.<br /><br />There are not enough words to describe how fabulous the last of the trilogy is. There are answers to questions and behaviors of the main characters, that prevailed throughout the previous two books. One gets a very strong message about how women were thought of and treated in Sweden. The political mysteries that were touched upon in the other books come to life and are explained. Most of all, there is closure for the main character.<br /><br />I did not want this book to end. All three books posessed every element to keep you reading; mysteries, crime, emotions and political hijinks, just to name a few.<br /><br />It had been meant that these books were to be a set of ten. Sadly, the author, Stieg Larrson, passed away before he could write any others. What a loss for all of us.<br /><br />A review could never justify the mesmerizing effect that all three books had for me. Pick the first one up, and I guarantee you that you will never stop reading until you have read them all.ever stop reading until you have read them all.
0307341550|4.0|This book is creepy good. Gillian Flynn, a former film and television critic for Entertainment Weekly magazine, ventures into almost taboo territory by populating this novel with evil women, a few irredeemably so. Her characters are believably flawed, and the story she tells is so unsettlingly horrific because it is realistic and disturbing. She relies on the terrible potential for pain and horror that we possess--rather than the supernatural--to create a palpable atmosphere of fear in this very readable novel about family secrets and sinister relationships. This is a true contemporary Gothic novel; it exploits our very real fears that the people we're related to might very well cause us lasting harm. I'm eager to read her new novel, Dark Places, and I hope that when this one is turned into a movie (as it almost inevitably will), a skilled director is chosen to helm what I hope will be a very talented cast.
B0029LHW68|2.0|I was very hesitant about the Kanye/Jared collaboration. Too bad they had to go and prove me right. (MTV news April 15th, 2009)    Sadly, this album does not rock.    The crowd is way overused. It sounded cool at first as Kings & Queens played on the radio. I figured if that's all they did with it, then it was way over-hyped but a cool addition. But to hear them on every other song? Come on...    I was a huge 30STM fan, but this album is a letdown of epic proportions. I started it on release day, got pulled away and didn't have any desire to listen to the rest of it till several days later.     Good thing it was the Amazon deal of the day and I only had to sink 4 bucks.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I purchased the 1st & 2nd series to put in my motor home, to watch when I become bored traveling, \\" Wow I watched the 1st dvd and could not stop untill I finished with the 2nd set, yes all in one weekend, this was like reading a book. I became captivated, my husband laughed and just called out for pizza. I can not wait to receive the 3rd series, and yes I plan on watching this sizzling series again.  The acting is superb.
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|The Killers - Live From Royal Albert Hall is an excellent concert video, revealing The Killers as brilliant musicians, both individually and in ensemble. Ronnie Vannucci's drums beat at the center of this astounding group like the steady heart of a seasoned jazz musician: always alive, always responsive to the band, always in perfectly chosen tempo. Dave Keuning, on guitars, is lightyears beyond the generalized strumming of most rock chord-players, speaking to us articulately and beautifully with his nimble fingers. On Bass, Mark Stoermer is powerful and elegant, never missing a step, or beat, and is vigilantly alert to his fellow musicians, always nuanced.<br /><br />The group inspires total confidence, which is in no small part due to the astonishing talent of Brandon Flowers, a singer whose grasp of vocal possibility, both technically and creatively, is far beyond his years. His pastiche of power, nuance, simplicity, refinement, flawless technique, and elegance place him solidly in the pantheon of great singers. Did I mention power? At 28, he has a command of his instrument, and an insight into it's mysteries, that most advanced artists do not begin to approach before they are in their 40's. Simply put, he is a phenomenon: delivering unbroken passion in perfect balance with his skill. Never missing a note or moment of connection, his attention is always with his audience, with giving them the best, and ALL of it. And they are ready and willing to take him up on his offer.<br /><br />The concert DVD / Blu-ray is first rate, mostly due to The Killers all-around brilliant talent as performers and composers, Flowers' lyrics always interesting, always impressionistic and captivating. The audience of fans delivers what has come to be expected by Killers followers: total enthrall and open-hearted excitment. Killers fans are always smiling. And as this concert proves, so are The Killers. Seldom, if ever, have I seen a band (or solo performer) project such open-hearted enjoyment, pure joy, at making music. Flowers and Vannucci never stop smiling, and neither do we. This DVD is simply brilliant.oy, at making music. Flowers and Vannucci never stop smiling, and neither do we. This DVD is simply brilliant.
1847879071|5.0|I've now endured one of the most miserable courses I've ever taken - a course on statistics. That course was consistent with what one might expect to exemplify typical stats courses everywhere - dry, boring, and no regard whatsoever for those who really want to know about the subject but have limited backgrounds. The primary text we used for that course was literally one of the worst I've ever come across, besides the fact that that book was nearly $200; it was poorly written and nearly comprehensible. I'd rather have hemorrhoids lanced than to have to read that book (or any part of it) again. Then, to compound matters, asking the instructor about the veritable tsunami of nearly incomprehensible material we covered in the class only led to suggestions that we go back and \\"read the text.\\"     In an effort to survive, I tried everything I could think of just to get through the course - I bought numerous other books on stats and conducted endless online searches just to hang on to my sanity.  I came across \\"Discovering Statistics Using SPSS\\" while combing Amazon for other resources and, while the book is somewhat expensive (although it is still far less than the text we were subjected to),given the fact that so many others had already given it a high rating, I took a chance: this book turned into a lifesaver!  I only wish that we used this book instead of our assigned text.  I'm very glad I purchased this book and can only hope that it will find use in classes such as the one I just suffered through.    Finally, I can't help but note a comment from the previous reviewer concerning the coverage of \\"syntax\\" - this book is NOT about every last advanced feature found in SPSS (which, is also a very non-intuitive and highly complex program), nor should it be! The other reviewer's complaint is utterly asinine. Who cares about syntax when you're just trying to learn about statistics? For those who haven't yet had to suffer through a stats course the uses SPSS (recently renamed\\"PASW\\"), \\"syntax\\" refers to the programming code that can to be manually entered into the program and is very DOS-like. This is one of the archaic things that SPSS/PASW and SAS (another stats program) heap upon users and doing so when one is just trying to learn the basic functions of the program makes things much more confusing.  With that in mind, this book does an outstanding job in explaining how to use SPSS which, under even the best of circumstances is not a simple thing to do.     If all textbooks were written as well as this one, students would learn a lot more, and learning would be far less painful.
B002SQ364Q|5.0|I was lucky enough to see this movie in an actual theatre (remember those?) this past September, and it really was a delight. Watching with a small group of friends and loved ones, I felt a kinship with the central character and his simple desire to do something, anything, to change his fate while the world seemed to be changing its tune - for those three days, at least. Being both a musician and a fan of all things European, I really liked the look and the pace of Ang Lee's film. While the book on which the film is based bubbles and froths madly and delightedly like a late Seventies hot tub, Lee's film presents a place and a time that feels alive and gentle like a spring leaf but also has the sullen gravity of the fallen leaf once the autumn comes. Demetri Martin comes across like a slightly-stoned Pinocchio, hoping -  through his 11th-hour involvement in helping to save Mike Lang's Woodstock festival from cancellation - to become a real boy. (It's not coincidental that the actor who plays his father, Henry Goodman, looks a bit like Gepetto in the Disney animated classic of years ago.) Those who complain that this film doesn't have music are missing the point - the film itself is music, and a soft and glorious one at that. Besides, there's a wonderful sequence towards the end of the film involving use of a song from `60s group Love being played on an 8-track cassette player in the back of a psychedelic VW van . . . that scene alone captures the real experience of being at Woodstock, at least as told to me over the years by those who were really there or who wanted so badly to have been there in person (though they were already there in their hearts). Having seen this film, I feel like I was at Woodstock too . . . and when this movie is available on DVD, I plan on going back . . .

0132350882|5.0|\\"Clean Code\\" informs developers how they can write code that is more readable and maintainable.<br /><br />The first section of the book covers identifying confusing code and rewriting it for topics such as variables, classes, and concurrency algorithms.  These chapters contain snippets of code before and after some thought was taken to make the code's intent clear.  Although the examples are all in Java, the principles could be applied to most languages.<br /><br />The second section contains case studies of taking source code and applying the ideas from the first section to contrast how much code can be more readable and maintainable.  It was difficult to flip back and forth between pages to follow the differences, but the case studies succeed in showing iterative improvement in the source code.<br /><br />The final section is a short summary identifying when code might need re-factoring to improve readability.<br /><br />I believe \\"Clean Code\\" does a great job showing how code quality improves when someone writes or rewrites code with the will to make it better.  Before reading this book, I applied some of the ideas from Robert Martin and the other authors, but after reading the book, I learned a lot how to write better code that I apply to my programming today.<br /><br />Just as [[ASIN:0321344758 Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition]] shows how poor web usability can confuse users and how to address it, \\"Code Clean\\" shows how poor code readability can confuse developers and how to address it.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I cannot really tell if this is how the Beatles sounded since the very beginning,or if it is how they are supposed to sound, since I was born a few years after their last original release.    However, what I CAN say is, that compared to the previous re-masters on Stereo CD, the sound quality and clarity on this mono re-master is absolutely fantastic.. for starters, the annoying \\"vocals on one speaker-music on the other\\" effect that was present in Rubber Soul, Revolver and others is absolutely gone.    To make things much better, the mini-LP replica packaging is a treat to all of us who did not have much of a chance to appreciate the original artwork. A MUST HAVE for hard-core Beatlemaniacs.
0380973839|5.0|If I were to write a jacket blurb for this book, it would go something like this:   \\"Ray Bradbury does it again with another stellar title. This is a novel of science fiction, mystery, beauty, and conflict. Starting with the first rockets to Mars, Bradbury tells the story of Mankind's spreading and fleeing to and from the planet. It is a great story and is not only for science fiction fans but also for anyone who enjoys a good book.     I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I picked it up thinking it wouldn't be to amazing, but once I picked it up I couldn't put it down. It isn't just another science fiction novel; it's much deeper than that. I would definitely recommend this book to all of my friends. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't willing to read and understand this, because it's a bit higher then comfortable reading level for me, but it's really not that hard. Any extra effort you put into reading this book is generously rewarded.    There really is no major character in this book, because the same person rarely appears in multiple chapters. It is a book of short stories, so this is I picked Captain Wilder of the Fourth Expedition as the \\"most\\" main character for two reasons. One, he plays an important part in the colonization of Mars as the captain of the first successful expedition to the planet (there were actually 3 attempts before his success).  Two, he is one of the few characters to appear in more than one chapter. I think he is somewhat similar to Tobias MacIvey from A Land Remembered in several aspects. They are both leaders, Tobias of his Cattle Company and Wilder of the Fourth Expedition and the mission to the outer planets, and they are both peaceful but powerful. They rarely fight anyone, and when they do, they never started it, they have a good reason to be in it, and they usually win. They do differ, because Tobias is always trying to make a living and drive cattle and get money, making him a bit more economic-minded than Wilder, who wantedto preserve the natural Martian landscape as it was when they first landed, making him a bit more conservative. I believe these two characters would get along fine. They never pick fights with anyone, so I can't see why they would with each other. If there was any interaction, I think it would be cooperation.     There are many conflicts of all different shapes and sizes in this book, so it is hard to determine the most significant one. I think one of the most major ones is between man and his fellow man. There are many examples of this throughout the book, from one on one struggles to gang fights to full scale wars. The largest of these is an atomic war on earth that destroys the entire continent of Australia in the first blow. Right after that, everyone is called home from Mars and only a handful is left. The book shows no clear resolution to this at the end. As one character puts it near the end of the book, \\"I take it most of Earth's a shambles, but the war goes on.\\"    One theme of this book is man's nature to ruin beautiful things, especially natural beauty like that of Earth and Wars. Near the middle of the book there is a small chapter who wants to go to mars on a rocket because he is afraid of an \\"atom war\\". Later in the book, we have that atomic war on Earth and actually destroy the entire continent of Australia, among other things. With mars, there is a chapter devoted to that too. It says \\"The rockets came like locusts, swarming and settling in blooms of rosy smoke. And from the rockets ran men with hammers to beat the strange world into a shape the was familiar to the eye to bludgeon away all the strangeness, their mouths fringed with nails so they resembled steel-toothed carnivores, spitting them into their swift hands as they hammered up frame cottages and scuttled over roofs with shingles to blot out the eerie stars and fit green shades to pull against the night.\\" And this is exactly what we do to mars. We kill off the Martian race, and then use their ancient cities for target practice. We then bulldoze what remains and build a city of steel on a once beautiful metropolis. This theme is easily applicable to real life. Basically, the life lesson is to appreciate natural beauty instead of destroying it. That's a moral many people could use.

B000ZELISO|5.0|I can't believe that this movie has a 3.5 rating.  It is a very good movie.  I know it's not as good as the book but none of them are or will be.  The reason I can't believe that this only has a 3.5 rating is that while it's not as good as the books, as a film, it is definately at least 4 stars if not more.  The Bonus features on the discs makes this a 5-star product to me.    The movie is engaging, dark, and actually quite amusing.  A well balanced film, in my opinion.  My only gripe is that there are added scenes that weren't in the book (and really aren't necessary at all) while interesting book material was left out.  Still, if you haven't read any of the books but enjoy the movies then you won't have missed any really critical information.

0141439513|5.0|From time to time I read a critical opinion on Pride and Prejudice that, while acknowledging its excellence, wonders why Jane Austen could not in her genius provide some more gravitas.  It's rather more observant and intelligent than your run-of-the-mill romance, to be sure, but a romance it is at bottom.  No political savvy, no real attempt to face the role of women in Regency England, just a cute love story with an enjoyably satirical bent.  Miss Jane herself seemed to agree with that assessment - she once called it \\"a little bit, two inches wide, of ivory\\".  Decorative, but hardly important.<br /><br />Would someone please tell me what these people were reading?  It certainly isn't the same book that I read.  Or the one that thousands of people have fallen in love with and has produced at least four separate movie and television versions (which is a detail that allows me to give away certain plot points below, confident that most people already know them).<br /><br />It is indeed a very romantic love story, if by romance we mean the attempt of people to open themselves up and accept each other with their good and bad qualities - not only accept each other, but admire each other and want to be together just as they are.  That process is difficult enough in this day and age, with the whole lot of us positively encouraged to be as frank as possible.  Back in Miss Jane's day it seems to have been a good deal harder, what with the restrictions placed on people in the way of acceptable behavior and the disastrous consequences for breaking the social rules.<br /><br />If, however, we understand \\"romance\\" to mean the story of a woman who doesn't know her own mind, who has been so hurt that she can't stand the thought of love, who is too headstrong to allow anyone to tame her, and/or who eventually finds her way into the arms of a muscular hero type and melts on the spot (which is, after all, exactly what happens in plenty of perfectly good romance novels), that's not precisely what we have here.  To be sure, the heroine of Pride and Prejudice does indeed begin the story entirely too headstrong to submit to marriage for its own sake, and she certainly finds her way into the arms of a man she previously despised (offstage, of course), but she doesn't exactly melt.  It would be more accurate to say that she learns to think for herself.  Whereas before she rejected her society's more foolish standards by reflex, she gradually comes to accept or reject what she's told by thinking it over first.  And people think that Jane Austen didn't consider the place of women in her world?  That there's no understanding of the big picture in Pride and Prejudice?  Baloney.<br /><br />Now, Pride and Prejudice doesn't mention the big picture very often, although it's always present.  The Bennett sisters get into trouble largely because a company of militia moves into a nearby village, and you and I both know that they're there to drill and train because at some point they will probably have to go fight against Napoleon Bonaparte, even though no one ever mentions his name.  The sisters also have problems because they have no brothers, and know that a distant male relative will therefore inherit their house when their father dies.  Rather than complain about these various disasters, though, the author shows us what their effects are upon the family in its daily life - the temptation to a group of young woman of handsome men in uniform hanging around, the scramble for advantageous marriages, and of course the question of whether one ought to seek a man one loves or a man with money if one can't have both.  Great authors know, especially when it comes to two-inch pieces of ivory, that it's much more powerful to show the impact of great historical events than to talk about them.  Jane Austen was a very great author.<br /><br />If she simply showed the workings of her society, though, she would have been simply a very good essayist, not a great author.  Fortunately for us, she was also an extraordinary stylist, and she had an enormous gift for irony, very much on display in Pride and Prejudice right from the famous first sentence.  That same twinkle remains in Miss Jane's eye right through the first sentence of the last chapter - \\"Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennett got rid of her two most deserving daughters.\\"  Few authors would dare spend hundreds of pages setting up two weddings and then dismiss them both like that.  It's positively delicious.  With that kind of language, that sly inclusion of social criticism and such intriguing characters as Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy, you can call Pride and Prejudice a cute little romance if you want, but I'm warning you - it has hidden depths.<br /><br />Don't let that scare you, though.  I told you, it's delicious.  Dive in and enjoy.<br /><br />Benshlomo says, Grown-up readers deserve grown-up books about grown-ups sometimes.unately for us, she was also an extraordinary stylist, and she had an enormous gift for irony, very much on display in Pride and Prejudice right from the famous first sentence.

B00129H7VS|1.0|I really enjoyed this series when it ran on HBO, but poor quality control has made it impossible for me to find a good set of Blu-rays of this series.  I have purchased Band of Brothers in Blu-ray twice, once from Amazon and then again from another vendor.  I had to return both sets for the very same reason. This is a 6 disc set.  In both cases, discs 1 and 6 played on my Blu-ray player, but discs 2 through 5 simply played a message that I was attempting to play them on a player from an incompatible region.  I can't imagine why HBO has not recalled these defective sets.  I'm reluctant to purchase another set because, even though the discs that worked were great, I don't want to go to the bother of returning yet another set if the problem hasn't been fixed.  I have many Blu-ray discs and this is the only time something like this has happened (and it happened twice)!  I'm surprised that the reviews don't contain more complaints about this situation.
B002RSDW80|3.0|This 2009 dramedy is an uneven case of dramatic bifurcation tied tenuously together by two characters who share a struggle to find their livelihoods through their passions. One is Julia Child, the larger-than-life culinary legend who found her calling when her adoring husband Paul, a U.S. Foreign Service envoy, is transferred to Paris in 1947. The other is her acolyte, Julie Powell, a bored call center worker for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation in the throes of 9/11, who also happens to be a failed novelist with a supportive husband in Queens. On her first film since the execrable big-screen revamp of [[ASIN:B000ASDFGI Bewitched]], director/writer Nora Ephron ([[ASIN:B0000AOV4I Sleepless in Seattle]]) decided to meld their respective books together, Child's posthumous autobiography, [[ASIN:0307474852 My Life in France]] and Powell's [[ASIN:031604251X Julie and Julia: My Year of Cooking Dangerously]], into a movie depicting them as soulmates. The central problem is that Childs' story is emotionally rich and more compelling, while Powell's comparatively trivial account is the one that provides the narrative framework.<br /><br />In Paris, Child instantly becomes a Francophile, and forces her way into the prestigious Le Cordon Bleu to take professional-level cooking lessons where she perseveres among her disapproving male colleagues. Finding her passion there, Child partners with French epicureans Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle to collaborate first on a cooking school for American expatriates and then on a massive cookbook currently in its 49th printing, [[ASIN:0307593525 Mastering the Art of French Cooking]] published in 1961. Her seminal TV show, [[ASIN:B0006VXMHG The French Chef]] premiered in 1963, and she showcased the spirited personality that engaged home cooks for over a quarter century. Flash forward four decades to 2002, Powell, tired of her mundane job, takes her cue from Child's 524-recipe book and decides to write a personal blog documenting her attempt to cook every recipe in the book within one year.  Child becomes Powell's muse, and her entertaining posts attract quite a fan base.<br /><br />However, her increasing self-absorption and cooking temperament start to make her marriage unravel. The two stories never really coalesce but just trail off in their separate ways. Nailing Child's braying tone and gawky manner, Meryl Streep is masterfully entertaining as usual, although there is a Looney Tunes-level edge to her mostly comic performance. She certainly evokes the memory of the real Julia, but there's also a surprising bit of parody that seems intended. Adams, Streep's co-star in last year's [[ASIN:B001PA0FFO Doubt]], is an engaging presence, but Julie is basically an insufferable, narcissistic character that needs an actress with a more natural edginess. It takes a considerable effort for Adams to overcome Streep's shadow to hold up her part of the story, but the basic inequity in the storylines is never truly resolved. Stanley Tucci, who played Streep's devoted associate in [[ASIN:B000J103PC The Devil Wears Prada]], provides a blessedly low-key presence as Paul, but Chris Messina ([[ASIN:B001DJ7PR8 Vicky Cristina Barcelona]]) is merely bland as Powell's non-descript husband Eric.<br /><br />In near-cameos, Mary Lynn Rajskub ([[ASIN:B001L5SRJE 24]]) provides needed snap in Powell's half, and once again, Jane Lynch, nearly unrecognizable in period clothing, steals scenes, this time from the formidable Streep, as Child's unapologetically high-flying sister Dorothy. The movie feels overlong at 124 minutes probably because neither story invokes that much in the way of surprise or conflict. Everything works out the way you would expect with one notable exception at the end. The 2009 DVD offers a couple of extras. One is the inevitable commentary track, which only includes Ephron explaining the details of the production, and without the participation of the cast principals, there are long periods where she says nothing. The second is a half-hour featurette, \\"Special Ingredients: Creating Julie & Julia\\", a better-than-average making-of piece.second is a half-hour featurette, \\"Special Ingredients: Creating Julie & Julia\\", a better-than-average making-of piece.

B00009Z574|2.0|Tormato has the dubious distinction of being one of the worst albums that Yes has ever released. On the surface and free of bias, it's actually not all that bad. A couple tracks on here actually have all the hallmarks of \\"classic Yes\\"; soaring vocal harmonies, multi-textured guitars, classical song structures, and celestial lyrics.<br /><br />The problem with Tormato is mutiple:<br /><br />1. The band decided to produce themselves. While this can sometimes work, as it had on Going For The One, sometimes if there is a lack of direction or focus, no one knows where to sail the ship. So they go in circles instead.<br /><br />2. The production is terrible. Rick Wakeman pulls some amazingly horrid sounds out of his keyboards, one of which included the new \\"Birotron\\" that he helped create in the late 70's. It was pulled from the market by 1980 with the rise of the Yamaha CS-80 and other revolutionary digital sampling devices coming from Japan. One listen to this monstrosity, and you'll understand why.<br /><br />3. The songwriting is fragmented. Yes works best as a democracy. On each respective solo effort, sometimes they're not as good as a Yes album, simply because you can hear the other elements are lacking (which essentially gives you an idea of what each person brings to the group.) The best Yes albums were borne from democratic songwriting (and sometimes even lyrics.) The Yes Album, Fragile, Close To The Edge, Relayer, Going For The One, 90125, Talk, Keystudio, The Ladder, Magnification...these are all examples of surpreme albums that benefitted from either two or more members working in deep concentrated collaboration, or more importantly, as a handful of guys sitting around a rehearsal room, barn, or living room, and working together face to face, bouncing ideas and energy back and forth in a true fusion of creativity.<br /><br />The worst Yes albums (generally the typical scapegoats tend to be Tormato, Big Generator, Union, and Open Your Eyes) were put together by recording different parts in different locations by individual band members, or the organic creative process was somehow disrupted.<br /><br />Bear in mind that I do consider myself a hardcore Yes fan (I've seen them live about nine times or so), and *do* enjoy all of their albums to varying degrees, including the ones mentioned above. But I have to be fair and critical when I hold a band of Yes's caliber up to a certain standard. They have reached amazing heights, even late in their career, and have been pronounced \\"dead\\" on more than one occasion, only to come roaring back with another classic work.<br /><br />So, all in all, I have problems with Tormato. Jon Anderson's lyrics (and actual singing) sound forced and unnatural on this recording. Alan White's drums sound strange. Chris Squire's low-end bass sounds like a dying alien whale (don't kill it, Chris...), and from 1978 onward, Wakeman would forever be playing cheesy synth tones, of which he would never recover again, and -- in my opinion -- makes me wonder as to why so many Yes fans hold him up to be the ONLY keyboardist that matters in all the various lineups. I honestly love his playing. But his choice of tones and keyed instruments has been terrible after this period, and was starting to show shades of Velveeta even as far back as Topographic Oceans. Sometimes I think that certain Yes fans took too much LSD and are actually stuck in an internal timewarp that doesn't let their mind get past 1973.<br /><br />Steve Howe is the only person who walks away from Tormato with his credibility and dignity relatively intact. His guitar tones are up to their usual standard of goodness, and he provides some great playing, especially on the mini-epic \\"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\\", which joins \\"Madrigal\\" and \\"Don't Kill The Whale\\" as the only decent songs on the album. The rest are all failed experiments.<br /><br />The cover art is an abberation, and a bad joke. I understand that they're trying to \\"go with the times\\" of the late-70's and not be tied to the Sci-Fi utopia paintings of Roger Dean, but the band's sound was so connected to that imagery by then that this one (and the previous failed and oddly-paired music/art of Going For The One) just stick out like rotten apples. (Later, the music and imagery fit together for 90125, Big Generator and Talk, so I don't consider Dean's work to be absolutely essential.)<br /><br />The original name for the album was Tor (as in \\"hill\\"), as there was a hill in Steve Howe's town of Devon named \\"Yes tor\\" (the topographic map with this is seen on the inside cover.) Funnily enough, this name would've been far better, and not made the album such an easy target.<br /><br />I only listened to Tormato once or twice when I first got it in the late 90's, but I've given it more of a chance in recent years. I like it and *understand* it better, but I feel that if more casual listeners were exposed to this directly after experiencing a masterpiece like Close To The Edge, Fragile, or 90125, it might scare them away from the rest of the band's really good discography.<br /><br />So...either get it as your first Yes album (you'll be free of bias and the shadow of other works), or don't get it at all. Otherwise, if you're already in the midst of collecting the myriad Yes albums, save this one for absolute last.<br /><br />Sorry if I come across as overly-critical. I do NOT begrudge other Yes fans for liking this album, or misunderstand WHY they love it...or if they have an emotional connection to it. We all have our personal Yes favorites that are generally \\"misunderstood\\". Mine happen to be Drama, 90125 and Union. So, yeah...<br /><br />2.5 stars<br /><br />Note: The 2004 Rhino remaster has several bonus tracks, including original demos, a B-side, and a handful of outtakes, as well as photos and detailed liner notes.

B002MW50KO|5.0|I admit that when I heard Bob Dylan had recorded a Christmas album, I cracked jokes about how it would sound.<br /><br />Now that I've downloaded and listened to it several times, I take those jokes back.  This is a beautifully produced, heartfelt and classic Christmas collection.  The instrumental and vocal arrangements are spot-on perfect, the perfect counterpoint to Bob's admittedly raspy voice.<br /><br />But who ever said all Christmas albums had to sound like Perry Como or angelic choirs? Indeed, Bob's imperfections are part of the special magic of this collection -- something like the joyful singing of my wife's 90+ year old Irish uncle. It catches my heart.<br /><br />And for those who give a \\"Bah! Humbug!\\" to this album, I can only hope that visits from the Bob Dylans Past, Present and To Come will soften their hearts.

0061122416|3.0|At the heart of The Alchemist is its message to pursue your dreams and not settle along the way.  Its overarching purpose resonated with me as did many of the points made throughout the journey, such as the importance of paying attention to the lessons that are learned along the path of trying to achieve your dreams, especially the ones that are particularly grueling and result in setbacks.  It is often the setbacks that make us stronger and give us the strength we need to keep moving forward.<br /><br />However, there were also times I felt that the messages were a bit flawed.  While I endorse the importance of perseverance and reaching for the stars, there seemed to be a parallel message that you should continue to pursue your dreams at any cost, such as leaving those who you love and care about or risking death.  Really?  This just didn't work for me.
B001BWQVUO|5.0|VERY IMPRESSED VIDEO , EXCELENT IN EVERY WAY, I'VE SEEN IT FOUR TIMES SNCE I BOUGHT IT, CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT.
B002ECJZ76|4.0|I ordered this through the Vine program. I was intrigued by the description. I just finished watching it and I was fairly impressed. Other reviewers have given the details and \\"spoilers\\" of the movie. I am glad that I watched it before I let my daughter see it (she is 4). The tale is dark at times and I think is more appropriate for slightly older children.  I think this could also confuse children based on what they know/believe about the modern-day Santa Claus - and the fact that there are different stories available.<br /><br />I agree with one reviewer who said that there were gaps in the movie that could have been developed better.  I thought some of the movie was abrupt and you didn't quite understand the entire \\"story\\" or relationship between characters. Also the ending was abrupt. Nikolas went from delivering presents at his last Christmas to showing up the next year in the sky with his reindeer.  The viewer is left to figure out what transpired. Was he really there in the sky? Was it just his spirit - meaning that of giving? Was it just a memory?<br /><br />Overall, I think it is worth watching. The acting is great. The voice-overs are very good. I watched it on a HD TV (large one) and didn't find it distracting at all (most dubbed movies are distracting for me).  But I did find that the one character, Nikolas' best friend, needed a different voice actor - having a slight New York accent detracted from the story.<br /><br />I will be showing this to our daughter in a few years....
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|This DVD makes it clear why Leonard Cohen has earned such an exemplary status as a poet, song-writer, and singer. The ensemble playing with him is wonderful,  his melodies are so inviting and memorable,  and he is a gracious and generous leader of his group. The DVD is of high quality and I have found his performance  simply mesmerizing.
B000002LRX|4.0|Another solid FNM album.<br /><br />There's some foreshadowing of Mr. Bungle in songs like \\"Be Aggressive\\", and then there's the always awesome \\"Midlife Crisis\\".

1596434252|5.0|i chanced upon this book through a random search. and decided to buy it the moment i saw the video!   i looked up websites of indian bookstores. none had an idea what the book was all about. online purchase was the only way for me to get my hands on this ephemeral piece of publishing history. so i got on to amazon, from where i have purchased a few cds during my stay in london.     the delivery date showed 24th december. i was dancing around my house like a mad man since i could not wait that long. and the amazon gods heard me! (probably they stay in the flat below us!) the book was delivered in almost three weeks time. arriving in the immaculate amazon box, i opened it very very carefully. and kept looking at the cover through the plastic wrapping. the letters moved of their own accord, like images appearing on paper in the developing tank of a darkroom.     i must add that amazon takes a lot of care in packaging their products and making sure they reach in pristine condition. i opened the book and turned every page with trepidation, lest i snap some of the letters. each letter was meticulously covered with small sheets of paper to avoid them from sticking or smudging. which is a very intelligent thought!     it took me an hour to go through each letter, wondering how in god's sweet world did marion bataille think of this. it was like being in pre-school again. discovering these strange looking shapes and attaching meaning to them.     the book is wonderful. everyone who loves books MUST have one in their collection.       one suggestion - please keep it away from kids. and buy a big box of paper gloves for people who would like to take a look!

B002MRRRAA|5.0|I'm a huge fan of metal music but always loved Nirvana. This dvd is for those fans of all time. I just fell into tears when watching this dvd. The passion, originality, energy and so on of this band will stand forever as an example for all the other bands and the music industry itself. So sad to see Kurt so close, in front of you and realizing you won't ever have the chance to see them alive again. But this DVD is the chance to go as close as you can to that dream...Beautiful.
0385504225|4.0|This book lived up to Dan Brown's reputation.  The story wants you to keep reading and finding out about real historical events.  The last chapter is great.  The book arrived quickly and in excellent condition.
0385341008|5.0|I've purchased and read several books based on Amazon reviews in the past & not one has prompted me to write a review myself.  Not until now because of course \\"Guernsey\\" is unique.  I LOVE this book.  I enjoy all types of literature, from Louisa May Alcott to Stephanie Meyer, from James Patterson to Charles Dickens...but this book is in a category of its own. There are no words to describe it.  The story is unique, the characters real & the format fantastic.  READ THIS BOOK!
B0006J28BO|3.0|I'm not going to go into extreme detail - if you like Miyazaki's other work, you'll recognize a lot of his stylistic influences present here. However, The Cat Returns is also missing a lot of the wit that makes Miyazaki's other films succeed, and simply put, it cannot measure up to his true masterpieces like Castle in the Sky and Kiki's Delivery Service. In the end, the entire plot feels like an elongated excuse to transform a Japanese schoolgirl (likely not of consenting age) into an anthropomorphic cat; a powerful and recurring fantasy for 100% of Japanese men over 40.
B001DHXT2A|5.0|The Incredible Hulk is action and chase scenes with some little drama sandwiched in-between. Marvel Studios did a great job making sure the film is true to the comics while still still being capable of greatness (along with Iron Man). Edward Norton is the best Bruce Banner of all time, his performance allows people relate to Dr. Banner's...unique position. This film erases any memory of Ang Lee's Hulk, which wasn't exactly....the best film. The film is in a way a half reboot/ half sequel to that film as the origin story is provided in the opening credits. The film in my opinion is better than Iron Man and The Dark Knight (although I love both those films).<br /><br />Edward Norton remains strong throughout the film. The chase scenes are jam-packed adds a never-decaying level of excitement to the entire film, Hulk may seem like a villain fighting the military, but you sure want to cheer him on! Liv Tyler, who had \\"disappeared\\" from film for a few years returns as the love interest of Bruce Banner and she is utterly fantastic! William Hurt is General Ross plays the father of Betty Ross (Liv Tyler's character) and archenemy of Bruce Banner. Tim Blake Nelson also has a small role as scientist Samuel Sterns (who later on becomes a major villain in the comics). The CGI is terrific as The Hulk and Abomination truly look very realistic. There is also references to other areas of the Marvel mythos (including the Iron Man film).<br /><br />The 3-Disc DVD is well worth the price. The first disc contains a excellent commentary by Director Louis Leterrier and Tim Roth and deleted scenes. The second disc contains a alternate opening of the film, along with an excellent jam-packed set of special features. The third disc is the digital copy.
1400063515|5.0|Bottom line: there is an element of uncertainty in everything we confide to know, but ignore this uncertainty in some instances more than others because of limitations and propensities of thought. The author claims to present a new idea, but a lot of it is along the same vein of How We Know What Isn't So: The Fallibility of Human Reason in Everyday Life by Thomas Gilovich. If you liked that book, you'll enjoy this one too. This book, however, is sort of a primer on learning to be a sound empirical skeptic and seeker of truth.
B00005JPO1|3.0|For so long the public wished for a another installment in the Indiana Jones (including me) and it has finally arrived! Was it worth the wait? Some might say so, but not me.  Although the film is still watchable. Indy's back and he may be older but he still has it! The film takes place in 1957 and this time Soviets are the bad guys instead of the Nazis.<br /><br />The movie suffers from some very \\"out-there\\" writing, I have the greatest respect for George Lucas but the lack of realism in this film saddens me.  Indy survives a nuclear blast by hiding in a fridge! A FRIDGE! Including aliens (or dimensional beings) doesn't bother me, but the way they play out does. The film suffers from too much CGI, a trait Steven Spielberg and George Lucas has unfortunately become associated with.<br /><br />The 2-Disc Special Edition is for fans only, as the film is only worth a rental. The first disc contains the special feature on a tribute to Indy as well as a feature on the pre-production of the film. The second disc contains a production diary and a pre-visualization feature. In the end the single-disc version is the one worth getting, or just renting it.
B00005MP58|5.0|I love this version of Pride and Prejudice.  It is 5 hours long, so it goes into great detail compared to other movies that are half the length.<br />I love Colin Firth, an excellent actor who portrays Darcy quite well.  Again, great price on amazon!
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Its easy to imagine why The Dark Knight is one of the greatest films of 2008, if not the best. A great ensemble cast mixed with fantastic a fantastic writer and composer turns this movie into more than just a great superhero flick but a cinematic achievement!<br /><br />The film may be a little overhyped but it definitely deserves the ratings it receives. Christian Bale is a great Bruce Wayne/Batman (despite his somewhat amusing voice as Batman), Gary Oldman really shines as Jim Gordon (in fact I view him as the best part of the film), Aaron Eckhart surprises us all as Harvey Dent along with his alter-ego. Heath Ledger does a very memorable performance as The Joker. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine also does great in their roles and adds icing to the already very delicious cake! The film is a great mix of action, drama, and a bit of comedy(just a bit). The dark tone to the film is perfect for the world of Batman and is the main reason the film is so great!<br /><br />The Two-Disc Special Edition is not worth the time to purchase however unless you want a digital copy.  The special features on the second disc are very not so special. Its much better to simply buy the single disc DVD or Blu Ray edition (which contains much more special features).

1400063736|5.0|Literature portrayed as mosaic is phenomenal, and even seems better when delivering a pretty or happy message that people - each full of human frailties  and weaknesses - can be the cause of great endings.<br /><br />Corrigan (who ignores his first name) encounters a divine calling in grade school to tend the poor.  Leaving his native Ireland for America, we learn about his impoverished life in rugged Bronx where he befriends the local street walkers - most particularly Tillie and her daughter Jazzlyn.<br /><br />From there we learn how people who cause great stress and strife to Corrigan, Tillie and Jazzlyn can become the closest friends to those closest to he and Tillie and Jazzlyn.  Even a marriage emanates.  And eventually good things come to Jazzlyn's two daughters who become model citizens and leave the streets which imprisoned  two previous generations of their maternal family.<br /><br />McCann may be saying that good people are reared, not born.  The mother and grandmother of the innocents are no less good in the core -  but being subjected to cruelty or not being as properly reared - they end in the opposite spectrum of their granddaughters or daughters.<br /><br />Like the movie [[ASIN:B000A3XY5A Crash]], we learn the fate for some can cross cultural, economic and other barriers. And, within clouds are silver linings. This book does not preach that good prevails over bad, it just recites how good can come from bad.<br /><br />In the end, we all must die. And as one old woman cleverly states, \\". . . she was tired of everyone wanting to go to heaven, nobody wanting to die.\\" But, when we learn the equality of man in the relative bizarre world of fate, does not the end result also happen with equality - the same for all?  I think Colum McCann was implying that streetwalking grandmother or samaritan-adoptive parent who touched the lives of the girls probably will be at the same steps of afterlife to greet the children - if there is an afterlife.<br /><br />Books like this are fun. The characters are rich and full.  Each seems to be someone you could and maybe will discuss at the next dinner date. This book ends up close to your heart. The characters almost seem like acquaintances. That is a great accomplishment by any writer.d full.  Each seems to be someone you could and maybe will discuss at the next dinner date.

B000ZELISO|1.0|Blue Ray disk has an annoying commentary box without sound that impossible to remove.  Blue ray disk is useless.  Returned disk and will wait until they print a usable version to buy again.  We have the whole Harry Potter collection but this disk is useless :(  We have no problems paying other Blue Ray disks on our system.
0810983915|5.0|Purchased this book for my son. According to my son, the storyline is very funny, the kids seem to able to relate to it.  He loved it so much he won't put it down. I bought him the whole series and he loves all of it. Great collection.
0446343129|5.0|This book should be a must read for everyone. It is very insightful and if you want to be healthy you need to know what an awful drug refined sugar actually is and how it is destroying your body. The truth is most people are sugar addicts and do not realize it, we are trained from an early age that sugar is a reward for finishing our meals, we are rewarded with candy for doing a good job, the media portrays soda and sweetened drinks as hip and cool \\"it's the real thing\\" and\\"Obey your thirst\\" many processed foods are loaded with sugar and we consume them in mass without bothering to read the label of the ingredients, Why? because most of us are sugar junkies! we are addicted to the stuff! and the sad thing is that it's no different than cigarettes, alcohol, crack or meth! Do yourself a BIG favor buy this book, read it and take charge of your health, make no mistake refined sugar is POISON!!!!
B000EQ5SRK|4.0|Sharon Stone and William Baldwin set the screen ablaze in this unrelentingly sexy thriller based on the novel by Ira Levin. Following her phenomenal success in the 1992 erotic blockbuster BASIC INSTINCT, Sharon Stone portrays Carly Norris, a divorced, sexually repressed book editor who moves into a luxurious Manhattan high rise and finds herself pursued by two men: the building's owner, Zeke Hawkins (William Baldwin), and writer Jack Landsford (Tom Berenger). She decides on Zeke, a compulsive voyeur who maintains a video surveillance of every room in the building; he may also be the mysterious psycho who has brutally murdered several of the tenants. In the suspense and terror departments SLIVER does not compare favorably to BASIC INSTINCT. As an exercise in eroticism, however, the film actually surpasses its predacessor. Although it has been said that Stone and Baldwin didn't get along too well when the cameras weren't rolling, they make an extremely hot screen team and engage in some of the most breathtaking sex scenes ever captured on celluloid; Zeke and Carly's tryst against a pillar is particularly risque for a mainstream feature.

B002ZF249S|4.0|Finishing up my review I said some of the deleted scene should've been put back in. A small problem I had with Two Face  is sometimes he acts like The Joker next he acts like Two Face should next he acts like his character from Blown Away plus Arron Eckhart is a better portrayal than Mr. Jones portrayal. Forever is a good sequel but I like the 89 movie & TDK better those were the best Batman movies IMO. It's certainly better than our next movie in the series.

B001CP4VNY|4.0|Back to my review. Schumacer wanted Robin to be in the movie so Chris O'Donnell was casted. Micheal Gough & Pat Hingle reprised there roles. Nicole Kidman was casted as Chase Meridan the love interest of the movie. Story Two Face is already established himself & he has struck on the 2nd anniversary of Batman capturing him so during his hiest at The 2nd Bank of Gotham Two Face sets a trap for Batman he overcomes it tries to apprehend Two Face but gets away next we meet Edward Nygma he creates a device that can read brain waves through T.V's Bruce Wayne tells him it raises too many questions. Nygma is obsessed with Bruce Wayne it turns to hatred because of the rejection. 1 of Nygma's Bosses are mad that he is still working the invention so Nygma just kills him & makes it look like a suicide. Later on he becomes the Riddler of course. Later Two Face kills Dick Grayson's parents who are Circus Acrobats Dick has to live with Bruce Wayne & eventually finds out he is Batman & Nygma joins forces with Two Face.
0763619795|2.0|I was disappointed to receive this in the mail.  I ordered it for my niece.  I didn't particularly think that the quality of the smaller book was that nice (not a board book type- just a really small paperback).  And the bear isn't much bigger than a beanie baby.  It was my fault for not looking at the dimensions, but I would've like a bigger book and bear for the price.  If you're wanting a tiny book and bear, then order.    As far as the story itself... I love the story and read it to my children.  Its repetitive and kids love it.  Fun to use motions while reading it!   We clap our lap, and then our hands to the rhythm...\\"going on a bear hung, we're gonna catch a big one\\"...the kids love it.  I would personally prefer a bigger book, however.
B001U3N3O6|4.0|So Riddler & Two Face join forces & they want to find out Batman's identity so at a Nygma Tech show 1 of the boxes read Bruce's mind & Riddler & Two Face find out that he is Batman they go to his house trash the Batcave & kidnap Chase Meridan. Robin finally is in a Batman movie now it's up to them to stop Riddler & Two Face. Despite it being family friendly I though Batman Forever was a good sequel. The score was was good soundtrack rocks acting was good for the except for some of Jones & Carrey's acting was over the top I really don't think the movie warrented 2 villains Two Face could've easily held the movie as 1 villain. Early on Kilmer tried to mimic Keaton but did come into his own but he's not Keaton or Bale but h**l of a lot better than what George Clooney did in the role. This is about the only movie Chris O'Donnell was OK in. I had no problem with Nicole Kidman I mean the Batman & Meridan stuff was filler but surprisingly good delete scene did help with the rank I gave the movie.

B0018CMJSU|5.0|The DVD giftset of The Godfather-The Coppola Restoration was wonderful.  The colors are wonderful.  We enjoyed watching all three DVD's plus the DVD of the making and restoration of the film.  They don't make films like that anymore.  I plan to watch it again soon.  Jo Pruette
0061719544|4.0|I've been watching Mr. Ferguson for several years and so was eager to read this book.  I find his type of comedy very funny and enjoy his tv show.  The book was just about what I expected.  Since a great deal of his material on tv and on the tv special of this year was about his previous experiences and his life while drinking and doping, there was not a great deal in the book that was exceptionally new material.  There were some things that I didn't know but really not many since he refers to this material over and over again.  He is really best at his improv. type of show.      THe book was relatively well written, easy to read, not long (I finished it in one sitting).  I think that it was a true autobiography from what I knew prior to reading it.  There were no suprises.  I would have enjoyed more pictures and a peek into his real life now.  I believe he tries very hard to protect his private life which is certainly understandable.     I believe this is a book for his true fans since I believe you need to know of him  and enjoy his style before you would buy the book.  It took me quite awhile to purchase it even as much as I enjoy his work. The reading level of the book is not exceptional and you don't have to have more than a 6th grade reading level to read it.  I would not reccomend it for anyone that age, however. If you are looking for comedy that's not what this is.  It's just what it says it is, which is very much what he presents...He's forthright and seems to be quite honest in presenting the bad with the good.     Overall, I wasn't disappointed and don't regret purchasing the book.
0765322889|4.0|This has got to be the slowest starting novel in history.  Something like the first 500 pages had me forcing myself to turn the pages.  I thought the slow \\"start\\" would never end, though my friend assured me to have faith.  He was right.  The last couple hundred pages are awesome.  I learned that this book has one of the most interesting characters ever created in literature: Anomander Rake.  I do not say that lightly.  For exposure to that character alone, this book is a must read.  Moreover, the other books in the series are solid too.  This is a good series to start; there is a book a year, all very good - get in on it, and you'll have a lifetime of books to read.  The others start slow too, but they stay slow for less and less time as you move along.  Overall, I recommend this book.  But you have to be patient and be prepared to work hard.  Very complicated plot.  Only for serious, avid readers.  If you have Danielle Steele on your shelf, look elsewhere.
B002QH2NUA|4.0|Paul McCartney is a classic. And their concerts are expected in the world with great anxiety. A great show with the best of the Beatles, Wings, and the legend of Paul frozen in time.
0756405890|4.0|Rothfuss is the next big thing in the fantasy world.  This is a fantastic book.  It starts a little slow though, even for me; the beginning is not as polished as say, GRRM would be.  Which is why I docked it a star.  But after that there are great twist and turns, none of which feel forced.  You get to know and very much like the main character, Kvothe.  An excellent 1st novel.  I hear that Rothfuss says he's learned a lot about writing since publishing this, has honed his skills even more, and book #2 should be even better.  As a first novel, this is killer.  Heck, apart from GRRM, and maybe 1 or two others, this book is probably the best fantasy out there, period.  Get in on Rothfuss now during these early years and you can say \\"I told you so\\" for life.  Buy, buy, buy.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Others have written such spectacular, thorough reviews of this CD, that I cannot add much more praise. I will comment on Susan's captivating rendition of \\"Wild Horses\\". My husband, who had never heard her voice until this CD, said he has always preferred the original-artist version of a song over any remakes, but in this case, Susan's version quickly became his favorite. In addition to Susan's vocals, I appreciated the variety on this CD -- the Stones' song, a Broadway song, hymns, and even a Christmas song.
B001FB55I0|1.0|the plot is one of THE worst ever. this is more of a side story, not a direct sequel. not how I thought the series was going to continue at all.<br /><br />also instead of making things flow smoothly continuity-wise ,they just take bits and pieces from the original and its sequel and threw them in here. you'll catch them if you're a fan.. cringe worthy stuff.<br /><br />I thought I was FINALLY going to see John running in the dark fighting TONS of Terminators, like those flashbacks have shown us,but NO. There were maybe like 10 Terminator bots in the whole movie. and not even at the same time.<br /><br />Don't even get me started on that new Terminator kid. How did he survive a NUKE blast? he came out of that whole in mint condition. that whole heart exchange thing..... RIDICULOUS !!! haha. why was that female pilot so dumb?<br />she swore to fight Terminators but she fell in love with this one in 5 minutes.<br />how can they give Bale such little screen time??? they never heard of Dark Knight?<br /><br />and the computer graphics?? SO SOOOO BAD.<br /><br />I'm so glad the movie rights are going to be sold off. hopefully another studio will wait for the right director and script. its a known fact the producers of this movie just wanted to make a quick cash with a cheesy movie. and it shows.<br />this movie has no soul.<br /><br />if you have time, Wiki what their plans were for their sequels. TRULY AWFUL STUFF !!!!
B000ZECQ08|3.0|Okay, then... the hospital scene? I just kept thinking...Snape standing there listening to this drivel? Watching Lavendar fussing like a ninny? NO WAY! They could have saved the scene with a good Snape scowl and eye roll.   My biggest beefs with this film... They never explained why Snape is the HBP, those extra scenes, expecially the waitress chick (??!!), and they never told us what the other suspected Horcruxes were! (ie the memories Harry needs in order to find them in Deathly Hallows!) Are they planning to cram all that down our throat in the first 10 min of DH so that we have some clue? ARRGGHHH!  I don't expect it to follow the book completely, but really now, how about getting the important points across before adding all the extra drivel. If they could make HP3 and its complicated time travel plot make sense on film surely they could have made this one better!  The best part as always is ALan Rickman's Snape. God bless him for sticking this out. Hopefully they don't sideline him in DH.
B001FB55HQ|5.0|This will probably turn out to be the strangest 5 star review you've ever read so bear with me. I will start out by saying I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from start to finish! I had really high expectations from the moment the initial trailer was released and I'm happy to say that I wasn't disappointed in the least. This is an action movie of the highest order! The CGI was outstanding! I have to take issue with those reviewers who claimed the CGI was not realistic. I have to disagree. I would say this is one of the more realistic CGI movies I've ever seen! The entire movie had a gritty, organic feel to it that was at once bleak and beautiful. Those of you looking for a slam bang good time filled with explosion after explosion you will be very happy.     However - and this is a BIG however - those of you looking for a movie with any kind of depth, emotion, or character development will be sorely disappointed! This ain't T2 people! The thing that made Terminator 2, and to a certain extent the original Terminator, so compelling was the depth of emotion James Cameron (absolute genius that he is) brought to his characters. The idea behind T2 was that if a machine, built for the sole purpose of death and destruction, can develop human feelings of empathy and compassion, then perhaps there is hope for all of us. The initial reviews of Terminator Salvation hinted at a similar theme: what does it mean to be human in a world where most vestiges of humanity have been wiped from the face of the earth? It is a terrific concept; unfortunately the opportunity is completely wasted. Marcus Wright (played by Sam Worthington who is a beast of an actor) is a very intriguing character, but he is never allowed to develop much of an arc. In the end he just feels like someone else put into the movie to shoot guns when he could have been so much more. Christian Bale brings the same dour, one note quality to John Conner that he brings to Batman. That raspy grumble of a voice works for The Dark Knight but here it's just off-putting. He is the bad-ass you'd expect John Conner to be, but for someone who is on the life-changing mission that he is on, he shows zero emotion. The same is true for every other human character in the movie. The machines may not have yet succeeded in wiping out humans physically from the planet, but they have definitely succeeded in wiping out their souls!     I also would have been okay with more time dedicated to the inner-workings of Skynet, or at least a little more history on how Judgment Day actually came to be. Perhaps that will be a topic for yet another sequel, but it could have gone a long way in this movie.     Overall I recommend this movie because it has all the look and feel of a great Terminator movie. Unfortunately it has none of the soul. Again, all you action/ adventure junkies (like me) will be in heaven. Those of you looking for anything more beyond the surface, stick with T2.     And a quick note about the DVD: the fact that there are NO special features included in the standard DVD release is disgraceful! I agree with virtually every other reviewer that this is a greedy move by WHV to force people to buy into their BS blu-ray format. The only thing this move will do is make me stay away from blu-ray that much more!  Nice job Warner!!

0385737947|4.0|I have to say that I did find that this novel reminded me of the Hunger Games, which I enjoyed immensely.  The Maze Runner was also very good and is apparently part of a series.<br /><br />The story begins when Thomas finds himself in a box which is opened up by the Gladers, boys approximately his age who all live within the Glade, a lush, controlled environment where all of their needs are met, save one, their freedom.  They are trapped inside with no memory of where they came from, only their names.  Memories of people from their past have been erased from their minds and no one has any idea why they have been sent to live in the Glade.  The Glade is surrounded by a maze, hence the title.  Each of the boys has a job as they've formed a relative community.  One of the jobs is to run the mazes to try to find a way out.  One problem, though... danger lurks within the maze and the boys know that getting stuck in the maze at night is a death trap.<br /><br />It's an interesting story, but a frustrating one.  Apparently none of the boys wish to speak of what they know about the Glade, so as Thomas poses the questions we're thinking, the answers come incompletely if at all.  It's frustrating.  I can only imagine that if I were there, I'd be chatting with everyone to see what I could figure out about the place.  No wonder they've been there for two years.  It just doesn't seem like realistic human behavior and I found it hard to accept as the entire book was structured around not giving anything away.  The ending, although comparatively rushed considering that the rest of the story is only about a week's worth of time, was surprising.  I only wish it were better detailled.  I found myself not caring as much about the characters as I'd like.<br /><br />I'll recommend this to my students who enjoyed the Hunger Games.  I think that boys especially will find it an interesting read.  I am certainly looking forward to the next novel in the series.
0739337297|5.0|He has a very unique writing style that leads to great drama and vivid details. I have now been a part of both of his most recent books (after being recommended by my dear son and daughter, Branch and Rebecca) and have very much loved them.
0452289963|5.0|If one pays direct attention when reading this book and absorbs the message by maintaining a certain awareness, one cannot help but obtain a life-changing experience. The content is far from difficult but like many seemingly simple messages, it will not be grasped by the casual reader. It truly woke me up. A must read.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|. . . will enjoy this wonderful movie.  Sweet, comical, creative, touching.  SIt is such a delight to watch something that is truly entertaining.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Out of all the Star Trek movies, I own all of them, this has got to be the best. Even better than \\"Wrath of Kahn\\". Since we recieved the movie, we have watched it at least ten times. We always find something new we didn't see before. GREAT movie.
B00138Z97C|4.0|What a pleasure it is to have the wonderful reproductions of the original LP covers in this set. It really does help create a sense of nostalgia and excitement. What a difference from the indifferent packaging of so many recent box sets.<br /><br />What will astound you in this set is the consistent beauty and artistry of the performances, how exciting it must have been to see her on stage. Her ability to wield such an enormous voice to create such a full, powerful and beautiful sound and then pare it right back without resorting to half tone or disconnected sound was a wonder.<br /><br />Some of the recordings have dated a little. The Rossini disc shows how much we have evolved the performance practice of his operas (little of the material is 'Rare' these days)and the comparison is fascinating. On the Donizetti disc the recording sometimes distorts the voice on high notes which is a dreadful shame. If there are any below performances they are the fault of some indifferent conducting and below par Spanish orchestras. The Granados arrangements are dull and the playing bland. The winds in some of the early recitals sound amateur, but this strangely somehow adds to the sense of discovery. Would it have been better to include her RCA Traviata or Lucrezia Borgia instead? Discuss.<br /><br />If you are unfamiliar with the Salome and Norma recordings you will be pleasantly surprised by the subtlety and effectiveness of her dramatic interpretation. All the recital discs are tremendous and sufficiently varied in the material covered... and of course I agree in the above reviewers' opinion of the Strauss Lieder disc.<br /><br />So much to enjoy, and what a lovely present to buy for someone you like more than yourself.
B002NXSRX4|3.0|For what it's worth, this is a fun movie to watch if you want some mindless entertainment. It's not going to win any Oscars that's for sure. The script is brutal, the acting more than occasionally cringe worthy, and the plot full of as many holes as a spaghetti strainer. However there are some great action sequences, as a sort of pervasive comic book fun that makes the whole thing better than the sum of its parts. Most of the characters are pretty one dimensional, and the few that aren't aren't given enough time to develop. I thought the most interesting characters were Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow, and their various confrontations made for the best moments in the entire film. They could have done so much more with that storyline than they did. It would have been more interesting to have Storm Shadow redeemed at the end than the boring girl friend character.<br /><br />The Joes being some sort of multi-nation peace keepers instead of \\"Real American Heroes\\" put a bad taste in my mouth. Is it so bad to have American Heroes these days that we have to turn it into a badass version of NATO?<br /><br />The powered exoskeletons were ripped right out of CRYSIS. They look almost identical. The undersea base of COBRA looked like a rip-off of BIOSHOCK. This is definitely a movie heavily influenced by video games and marketed to the same demographic. Nothing wrong with that--it's actually A LOT better than 90% of movies based on video games.<br /><br />Despite some pretty glaring flaws, the movie is pretty entertaining. I went in with pretty low expectations, and ended up enjoying it more than I thought I would. Don't expect too much from RISE OF COBRA, and you just might enjoy it too.<br /><br />2.5/5 Stars. Silly but fun.
B001LRJH0U|3.0|I have always loved Ed Harris as a character actor. This time he acts in and directs Appaloosa. Harris plays Virgil Cole and Viggo Mortensen as Everett Hitch who together roam the western United States as hired guns and help out towns to be kept free from outlaws. They come to Appaloosa to help it get rid of Jeremy Irons who has killed the Deputy. After going on about cleaning the town, they encounter Widow Renee Zellweger who becomes a threat to their friendship.<br />The movie was based on a novel by Robert B Parker. Highlights of the movie include the scenery or landscape of New Mexico, the chemistry between the two leads i.e. Harris and Mortensen. I thought Zellweger was miscast and so was Jeremy Irons. The comedy between the two leads is funny but subtle. I though the scenes when Mortensen has to complete Harris's words are funny and so was the scene with the Chinese man in the caf&eacute;. Don't expect any sudden fireworks or explosion but some good acting and a thing called chemistry between the two male leads. I give it three stars 121009
B000ZEE3I6|5.0|There are some spoilers in this review, so if you haven't watched the movie yet, I recommend that you don't read.      I've read quite a few of these other reviews, good and bad, and I agree with some of both. I think that YES they did leave a little too much IMPORTANT info out of this movie, while I also think they did a good job of getting more of the book into this one. There were VITAL scenes that they left out though, In the scene where Snape kills Dumbledore, he did make impossible for Harry to help him in the book, and I think that should have been kept in the movie. If they HAD to take it out, which I seriously doubt, why did they have to make it look like Harry didn't want to help? That made me mad. Also, one other part of the book that I considered VITAL to the movie was the funeral at the end. This was the most beautiful part of the entire book and it was also a little confirming. I say this because when I read the book, a little part of me kept thinking, \\"Maybe Dumbledore's not dead\\" and the funeral kinda gave me confirmation, and a beautiful closure.     This movie was rated 5 stars by me because I feel like it is a breath of fresh air compared to the last movie, which was my favorite book, and Phoenix was absolutely butchered. This one however kinda sets the pace a little better in preparing viewers for the last of the series and all the great things to come.     This movie really gives off that sense of urgency that you feel when reading the book when you consider how important it is for Harry to learn all that he can about Valdemort because he IS the ONLY one who can kill him. I just wish that they would have reminded you a little more in this movie WHY he needs to be killed.    But like I said, I did enjoy this one much more than the last, so I have to give it kudos. I read the book twice, and there were details in the movie that I had forgotten were in the book until I saw them on screen.     Five stars from me. Thanks.
0385504225|3.0|While I enjoyed most of the book, I got weary reading it torwards the end.  I felt the author was leading up to a huge, earth shaking climax; however, the ending was flat and lacked substance.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Enjoyed this movie in IMAX and love it on my 55 in tv as well.   Enjoyed some of the extras on the second disc.  If you liked the movie would highly recommend this
014241493X|5.0|A poetic coming-of-age story told in the voice of the bored, swearing, acronym-loving, technology-tinkering, boundary-stretching, misunderstood modern teenager. Though the book is about Quentin's quest for Margo, it is also about Quentin himself. We learn about Quentin's depth, his taste for life and his comfort with the norms. With him as our filter, we can unravel the complicated social spread of the modern American teenager: the techies, the jocks, the bullies, the freshmen, the band geeks, and the people who are better than labels.<br /><br />Though Quentin's antics take him off the straight and narrow with increasing frequency as the book progresses, we see that good kids can live life without wanting to be delinquents. They can show up at parties where underage drinking is practically expected, but they can also come home dead sober hauling a stupid friend that has a beer can superglued to his palm. Quentin doesn't tell his parents everything, but that isn't always a bad thing; when it comes down to it, he knows they're there for him, and he is more responsible on his own than he is under supervision.<br /><br />My favorite part was when they mentioned how research needed reliable sources. That and the superglued beer can.<br /><br />A new modern classic. Highly recommended.
B001MW0IY8|5.0|I can't really describe the genre of this music but it's very enjoyable.  The songs tell a story like jazz but it's vocals are strong and not overwhelmed by musical instruments.  I saw them perform for a late night show and enjoyed their set.  This CD is in our living room CD carousel.
0399230033|5.0|This has been our staple \\"going to sleep\\" book for several months, now, and my son is only 1 year old.  He loves this book and selects it far more frequently than others in our library.  The story is in the pictures and we always seem to find something new.
B001F12J48|2.0|I love The Polar Express movie itself.  I love Tom Hanks.  I have seen the movie in the theaters, and believe me, that was great.  I thought the 3-D version would equal or top the theatrical experience.  Boy was I wrong!    When I played the 3-D version of this movie on my LCD computer monitor, I expected to be wowed by the movie.  The 3-D visual effects when something is coming toward you are amazing.  However, the other imagery is just awful.  Doubled images are just not meant for a movie of this caliber!  Shame on Warner Brothers!  Their holiday classic is terrible in 3-D!  I expected a much better quality movie than this!    If you want the best version of The Polar Express, you might as well buy the 2-D version alone.  The 3-D version is not the best, it actually is the opposite, THE WORST version of a movie I have ever seen.  If Warner Brothers should have released this movie in Real3D, it would have been FAR better.  The anaglyphic glasses and visual imperfections have TARNISHED the reputation and high prestige of this movie!    WARNER BROTHERS, YOU SHOULD RE-RELEASE THIS MOVIE IN REAL3D!  YOUR MOVIES HAVE BEEN GREAT, UP TO NOW!
B000025RHI|4.0|I Don't Have any more to add to the above reviews, this is one of those all-time classic Reggae albums made at Lee Perry's Black Ark studio in the 70's.... pure and simple.    Unfortunately i was a little let down by this particular version of the album, the mastering could be a lot better, and i have heard better versions on CD/download that have much better clarity... a small gripe but something to consider before buying this issue of the classic album.    I have since read that the definitive version is the Blood & Fire re-issue (BAF 9)Its re-mastered and has added bonus tracks... kicking myself for not getting that instead.    But as classic Reggae albums go, this is one of the best. Give thanks and praises for The Congos.     Keep on rowing to the higher ground!
B00006D295|5.0|This is a crazy twist on the traditional \\"Frankenstein's Monster.\\" Join the near all-star cast of big named actors like Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick, and Meat Loaf in their various musical numbers throughout the movie. My mother introduced me to this video when I was younger, and I was fascinated by the oddities included within it. Those of you with conservative viewpoints may not like it, but it is definitely for those who love crazy movie plots.  Every time I watch this movie, I have to jump up and do the Time Warp along with the actors.  A definite must see!
B0006SNK9E|5.0|Glitter Rock, Glam Bubblegum... this is just plain rock fun. The previously unreleased B sides of the early singles are on this collection. If you own \\"Desolation Boulevard\\", this album will compliment this one nicely. Enjoy and Stay 2nd :-)
0545123267|2.0|I actually bought this for my friend for a Christmas gift but I decided to read it before I gave it to her since I read the whole Twilight series and enjoyed all of them (even if the last one was kinda crazy). I have to say I definitely judged this book by its intriguing cover and thought it would be a good little romantic scifi read, but I was wrong. (Still going to gift it though... money doesn't grow on trees)<br /><br />It was nice to step out of the vampire world for a moment and enter a world with just werewolves, but there wasn't a whole lot of explanation throughout the story. It was cute, sure. Boy meets girl, boy loves girl but is inhibited by some paranormal state so their future is iffy, I get it. But the story-line had multiple holes in it. If there was suddenly a problem, there was always an obvious solution. It was too predictable and when it wasn't predictable, it seemed random and just stupid.<br /><br />Most importantly, I didn't like any of the characters. The main characters were supposed to be juniors or seniors in high school and yet they would say things that weren't fitting for their age. I found all of the girls annoying, aside from Grace, who I couldn't really picture in my head what kind of person she was. Sam was okay, but his random lyrics and poems were too cheesy for my taste.  I think in order to like a book, I need to like the characters or at least understand them to become attached to them.<br /><br />I could go on and on about all the little things I didn't like about this book but the worst was the ending. I'm not gonna give anything away but after I read the final page, I said out loud \\"Whaaat?\\" meaning...That's it? Yeah, the ending sucked unfortunately.<br /><br />Overall... if you really are interested by this book, I suggest getting it from the library for free before spending money on it.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Mama Mia the price was reasonable and it was delivered promptly.  Thank you for the great product and service.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|This is a wonderful movie, so hilarious and warm and at times painfully real. You can't beat a cast with Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. And it takes place around Christmas time! When you lug out all your old favorites that you've been watching since you were 3.<br /><br />Ever since my kids bought the first PS3 out there I've been hooked on blu ray. We're just the movie-watchin-est family.<br /><br />I've been buying all the action films and greats on blu ray, but then I ordered an old favorite that I had misplaced (it ran away to live with my children). The amazing difference in picture quality has me replacing my old library slowly but surely when a blu ray version comes out.<br /><br />Love, Actually was always on my blu ray list - I justify by maintaining that they last longer. Heh. Good excuse, hey? L,A is so much more vivid - I notice all kinds of small things I missed in what seems like the rather washed-out standard dvd.
B001KVZ6G6|4.0|Never saw in the theater... meant to, but my \\"date\\" blew me off! Having seen the reviews on RT, and being a general fan of Pixar (hope Disney doesn't screw up a good thing) I decided to take a small, $20 leap of faith.   I will consider this money well spent. For $20, I got a reference-quality blu-ray, and a pretty good movie to boot. The story is pretty unique in the telling, but as with all good stories, it's the underlying messages that will touch. Sorry, no spoilers here... when I open my Christmas presents I prefer to BE suprised, rather than ACT suprised!   The technical aspects of the blu-ray are beyond reproach. Punchy, dazzling colors in almost every scene, crisp lines, no artifacts that I noticed... all around spectacular picture quality. And the sound is just as good - punchy, crisp and very well mixed. Dialogue was always came through cleanly, even in the noisiest scenes. Surround was immersive without being showy. Very cool.  As a fan of Pixar films, I would have to rate this below Toy Story, TS2, and Finding Nemo, but better than Cars and maybe The Incredibles. If that gives anyone a guage line. Anyway, for the money, certainly recommended.
B00005JPAO|5.0|The Queen has been raised to believe in absolute values.   But she lives in a dark age of consumerist, media mediated shallowness.   When her people desert her for the false image of a demented daughter-in-law, she must choose between what she has been taught is \\"true\\" and what the marketing people tell her she must \\"be.\\"    This film suggests that identity in the modern age is a hoax.  We are all whores and we will kill everything we love (pay attention to the scene with the deer: the greatest moment in contemporary cinema) to stay in the spotlight.      This is the wittiest, most profound film of the 21st century.  Probably there has been no film since the days of \\"Pygmalion\\" in which the British cinema has come so close to besting Shakespeare.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time...it stays with you for several days. I highly recommend it!
B0013D8LOK|5.0|What is it about the musical?   Just when you think the genre's dead and buried, along comes this lyrical, flowing, river of dark poetry.   The screenwriter-- a lifelong fan of Sondheim's masterpiece--  did a brilliant job of adapting a semi-Brechtian theater piece and making it into a dark dream film.   Gone is the post-modernism, replaced by grand guignol that may sometimes scream too brightly in crimson, but that works far better than one might have had reason even to hope.     I loved every minute of it (and if there were a few seconds here and there I could have lived without, well, that's why fingers are long enough to shield the eyes from the sight of lawyers being processed into sausage).
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Well, with all the hoopla generated by the release of this box set there were bound to be a few disgruntled buyers but as you can see the overall response to this is thumbs up. I procrastinated buying this upon its issue and was dismayed when the price rose to 225 dollars, so jumped at the chance to buy it when it appeared at Costco for 175 dollars. Now that the price has dropped further, it crossed my mind that I should have waited even longer but those are the breaks...  The biggest question is value. Is this set worth the 180 dollars it was originally being sold for? The answer is unequivocally yes! Not only do you get all 13 Beatles albums together in one handsome CD set, each album comes with lavishly illustrated booklets filled with snippets of commentary contemporary to its original issue and interesting retrospectives. You also get a double-CD set of past masters AND a 49 minute CD of interesting mini-documentaries. Now doesn't that sound like a good deal?  When I read the reviews I noted some complaints that the albums should have been remixed rather than remastered. I don't know, I have a pretty decent stereo system and the remasters mostly sound better than the originals ever did. There are only a couple songs that sound oddly disembodied, but those are songs on which the Beatles were experimenting with new recording techniques anyhow.  I can't say that The Beatles Stereo Box Set is the ultimate Beatles collection, but its all the Beatles music I am ever going to need. Treat yourself, add this to your collection!

B002JCSWUW|5.0|This is the dream film of 2009.   I saw it at Warner Bros Studios the night before Obama received his Nobel Peace Prize and both the film and the Obama phenomenon (fantasy or otherwise) seem to represent our most hopeful selves.      Afterwards, alone in the dark on a cold night,  I wandered around the backlot-- the old New York brownstones from the Jimmy Cagney gangster films, the Paris street from \\"Casablanca,\\" River City from \\"The Music Man,\\" James Dean's small town street from \\"East of Eden,\\" and the stages with plaques on them indicating that \\"Streetcar Named Desire,\\" \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" and \\"Adventures of Robin Hood\\" had been shot inside.   Somehow, this setting which gathered together the whole world of the cinema, was the ideal one in which to process the beautiful movie I had just seen.     The idealism of the old Warner Bros is everywhere present in \\"Invictus,\\" a \\"movie movie\\" (which I judge as a Hollywood entertainment-- not as an \\"art film\\") that takes the world today-- with all its fears and dangers-- and finds within it not decay and destruction, but a global village blessed with hope, the seeds of a better world ahead.    The performances, incidentally, are fine all around.   Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon are superb; that, by now we can expect.   But there are wonderful surprises-- especially in the interaction among Mandela's bodyguard, composed of former enemies, white and black.   Eastwood finds many sublime moments here which exemplify the humanity of his late style, of which this film is a prime example.      In Hollywood history, there was once John Ford, Howard Hawks,  John Huston, and Victor Fleming.  Today, let us be grateful that we have Clint Eastwood.  Hooray for his honest, humble poetry!   May he make films until he's 100!
1600243916|2.0|Sadly, it took this book to motivate me to write a review on this site. I really enjoyed the first half or so of this book. The stories about some well known outliers were quite informative and the point the author was trying to make was fresh and relevant.    However, at some point he diverted from his stated theme and started talking about rice paddies and inner city schools, etc. His comparisons of rice farming to American farming are horribly inaccurate and portray American farmers as lazy and unmotivated. I am guessing he has had zero actual exposure to the day to day activities of managing a farm in this country.    Finally, what is with his fascination with black box recordings from downed planes? This content was only loosely related to the underlying theme of this book...not to mention boring.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Food Inc. is a great documentary-movie. The direction, organization of material, music, everything is perfect into place. More importantly, for me, it was hard to believe that it is NOT actually a movie, but REALITY. It was simply shocking to learn the truths of the present food system - all the mass production - how the system has completely lost the balance between being consumer oriented and profit oriented.   It is MUST WATCH for all Americans!!
B0029LHW68|3.0|I haven't bought a CD in awhile, but decided to give this one a chance, because I liked their last one. Hearing that it was more epic helped in my decision, because I'm a fan of that style of music. After listening to this, I can't help but be disappointed. It's like every song follows the exact same formula:    Step 1: Start with a simple beat and maybe some crowd chanting and let it build...    Step 2: Let the whispering commence. Leto is at his whispering best here, making all the lyrics seem so much more powerful because of said whispering.    Step 3: WALL OF SOUND!! Leto screams because he's tired of whispering, and all amps are turned up to 11.    Step 4: Decrescendo until your song reaches 6 minutes in length.    Step 5: Repeat.    Does anyone else agree with this, because I feel like it is a fairly accurate interpretation of the musical styling on this CD? It's not the worst formula, because I liked it on a few songs, but it seems like every damn song is the exact same.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I've never seen such a good movie! my god this movie is VERY good. the special effects my god you couldn't even know what was special effects and what was real (the scene of the Woolworth building collapsing is one of the best scenes I've ever seen in my whole life).    I didn't feel sick at all.I don't know how some people could get sick.    Thia movie is absolutely BRILLIANT. I mean, you really feel you're IN the movie, in the middle of the disaster.  J.J. I love you for finally making this movie.    Now the U.S.A. can say they've made a good (gooooooood) monster movie!!!!!
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|I expected nothing less than a mind blowing performance on this DVD. The Killers Live at Royal Albert Hall is such an awesome DVD!
B000MVQIEO|5.0|I often watch this show over and over. Great show about growing up and a great drama that your entire family can enjoy.
B002VKE0XA|4.0|We saw this movie in the theater, which was a really good way to see it, but I'm guessing that watching it in a dark house would be phenomenal!   The beginning of the movie had to establish the characters, so it was a bit boring. You really had to use your imagination through the first half of the movie, and I think it is more the IDEA that something could happen was more of the fear factor. That said, the movie was pretty intense in some parts, and I literally screamed LOUDLY at one point, which is not something I have done in a movie theater before.   There are a lot of comparisons between this and Blair Witch, and I can see that. However, Blair Witch had a lot more action in the evening scenes, and I was too afraid to actually scream out when I saw that one in the theater.  I love scary movies, and to find one that is unique and you don't know what is going to happen next, it is a real treasure. For those who are scary movie fanatics, this movie is a must-own.
B000IOM1YG|5.0|I've always loved this album!  It's not often that I love every song on an album but I've found true love with this one.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|For those of you who were wondering if Alice in Chains (AIC) could do it after such a long hiatus, rest assured this album is nothing short of incredible. The album starts off with a track called \\"All Secrets Known,\\" which will remind AIC fans of the song \\"Died.\\" Right after that, turn the volume way up because it goes into one of the catchiest songs on the album called \\"Check My Brain.\\" The guitar riff on this is just ridiculous, and the combination of Jerry and (new guitarist and singer) William Duvall singing makes this song spectacular. This song makes me want to drive fast! The song \\"Your Decision\\" will remind AIC fans of \\"Nutshell\\" from Jar of Flies. The song \\"Acid Bubble\\" is a very intense song and changes rhythm drastically a few times throughout. Turn the volume up on this one too! The highlight of the album, however, is the last two songs. \\"Private Hell\\" gave me chills the first time I heard it. Looking at the lyrics, it seems as if Jerry explains the private hell people create for themselves when they don't embrace the people they truly love. Jerry and William sing in perfect unison on this song and the harmony literally touches the soul. One of their best songs ever!!! Finally, the album closes with \\"Black Gives Way to Blue,\\" which is a tribute song to the late Layne Staley. For those of us who have been fans of AIC for a long time, this song will put lumps in your throat. The length is short (kind of like Layne's life) and Elton John plays piano on it. Jerry shows his voice off like crazy on this song. This album is incredible, and I am happy to say that AIC is back. A warm welcome to William Duvall as well. You fit the band quite well.
B002NOAF9W|3.0|wow, lots of your reviews are correct.  I'm not a cheap person, but I find it interesting of how expensive rolling stones remasters are for what you get.  The original recording is amazing by itself, i dont really think its been remastered or needs to be, i enjoy the raw sound.  i know they have alot of footage from that tour in vaults somewhere, or maybe in ian stewarts basement.  these creators at this label got really stoned and didnt roll out anything good.  ike,tina, and bb have way better live recordings.  the dvd is a tease some footage is already been released on gimme shelter criterion edition..hold your breath because i doubt the stones will ever release the classic stuff anybody wants..those remasters should be $10..one last thing, they didnt release a newer updated ya-ya cd by itself, they want you to waste $45.  this is for the true collector or fan if youre not buy the original version cd of this album or a exclusive import..
0743298039|1.0|On the back of this book are reviews that simply do NOT apply to what is written on the pages of The Thirteenth Tale. After reading this, it is clear to me that anyone believing this novel stands on its own, or compares to Jane Eyre has either been snookered by bogus reviews (believing there is substance where there is none) or they have been bought. In truth the pages offer little more than rambling, implausibility, insults to the mind and atrocious grammar. Characters drop in and fall away when they get in the way of cohesion.  They are either fragmented or run on and on and on as do her sentences. Not even my reading glasses could take the absurdity of this book, breaking and falling to the floor after chapter 4.
0385751893|4.0|This is a book project for my class; so my review will be long & boring; but here it is anyways:    One major conflict in this book would be the friendship between Bruno & Shmuel. In this book, their unique friendship hits many obstacles, but in the end, they end up together hand in hand. I can't describe much, because that will ruin the entire book!  One of the characters in this book, Bruno, would get along well with Zech, another little boy in one of my current books, A Land Remembered. They're both curious, adventurous, brave & intelligent. They'd help each other.  **Jacket Blurb Section**  The Boy in the Striped Pajamas- A great story about two little boys with very different circumstances that end up with an inseperable & very unique bond. A must read!      I would definitely recommend this book to anyone! It's inspiring, magical & gives you the feeling that you're in the life & times of Bruno. People who like history, but don't want to read a million pages to get to the good stuff would love this book. Overall a great read! :)
B002TYZKIM|3.0|This Is It (Kenny Ortega, 2009)<br /><br />I think everyone knows this by now, but for the record, the footage that was compiled, edited, and released as This Is It was never meant to be seen by anyone but Michael Jackson (and, presumably, a handful of trusted advisors, as well as those working on the shows). Nothing about this is finished; this is not in any way a concert film. If you're not the kind of person who can listen to a third-generation bootleg tape and visualize the original concert, This Is It may not live up to your expectations. (This is, in fact, exactly the reaction my daughter, a Michael Jackson fanatic, had to the movie.) As a document of the creative process involved in the making of such a massive live show, however, it sheds light that very few people have seen, and in that way, it is quite valuable.<br /><br />One does not put together a cast-of-hundreds live performance at the drop of a hat and simply allow everyone to do what they want. Michael Jackson has to ride herd on an incredible number of artists here, including a few full complements of dancers, a large number of musicians, a gaggle of lighting and video techs, and all the other people involved in order to pull something like this together. And while some of the management methods may seem a little on the odd side, whatever the man did, it held him in good stead for quite a number of years and quite a number of huge performances; from the looks of things here, it was going to work again. We only get to see, in many cases, the barest outlines of what would have been. In some cases, not even that. (The whole girls-in-cages thing, for example, gets a few mentions, and we see some early cage prototypes, but nothing of the actual routine.) In other instances, the routine is almost completely worked out, and we see, sans lights, big explosion effects, and most of Jackson's vocals (it's mentioned by a few people that he's preserving his voice), the finished product (\\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" and \\"Beat It\\" being the two that seemed closest to done to me). Throughout it all, Jackson stops the action once in a while to tweak something, however small it may be. Control freak? Perhaps, but there are quite literally thousands of little details, and every last one of them has to be worked out, especially in songs with video accompaniment (\\"Thriller\\" and \\"Smooth Criminal\\", for example); everyone's got to do everything right when it's supposed to be done. You can't pull that off without some control freak in you, I don't think.<br /><br />It's not bad, but more than anything it's frustrating, seeing what might have been (and I say this as someone who's never been all that big a Michael Jackson fan). And, like most concerts, I found myself wondering why some songs had been included and others (\\"Rock with You\\", \\"Off the Wall\\", \\"P.Y.T.\\", all number one hits) had been left off the list. But what's here is kind of fun to watch. Instructional as well, not that any of us would ever be putting a show this big together, but you can always dream. ** ½It\\" being the two that seemed closest to done to me).

0394721780|4.0|The book arrived very quickly. I was a bit disapointed as it is a paperback, thought I had ordered the hard cover version, but that was a mistake on my part. At any rate the movie \\"julie and julia\\" prompted me to purchase the book. It is very good. Made Boeuf Bourguignon the 2nd day after receiving the book and it turned out awsome!.
B000XA5K48|4.0|Shoot 'em Up (Michael Davis, 2007)<br /><br />I knew I was going to love Shoot 'em Up about thirty seconds into the movie, when we first see Smith (Clive Owen), the film's protagonist, and he's sitting at a bus stop looking all badass and...eating a carrot. That was my first clue that this is not your mama's action film, and boy, is it ever. Ever not. Something like that. In any case, what it turns out to be is a hilarious, and brilliant, sendup of every genre clich&eacute; there is, while still being the most satisfying action movie I've seen this year, if not longer. I'm just going off the top of my head here, but I think this is my favorite action movie since Dead or Alive: Final. And that's saying something.<br /><br />In any case, after an opening scene where a lot of things blow up in a very amusing manner, it comes to pass that Smith finds himself in charge of a baby and on the run from a gang led by a nasty sort named Hertz (Paul Giamatti). Smith needs to find some way to feed the kid, so he enlists the help of a reluctant prostitute (Monica Bellucci) who's currently lactating. The rest of the movie involves the three of them dodging a whole lot of bullets while Smith tries to figure out what Hertz and all the gangsters he can enlist are after this kid. (I'm not even going to hint at it, because when I say this movie is brilliant, I mean it. Amazing plotting here.)<br /><br />Davis (Monster Man), who also wrote the screenplay, fires on all cylinders here. Everything is well-done, and everything integrates well--the strong character development, the comic timing, the plot and its twists, the amazing acting (aside from the top dogs, the movie also features such excellent, and in many cases underrated, actors as Julian Richings, David Ury, Daniel Pilon, and especially Stephen McHattie, whose very name attached to any movie in the past ten years, seemingly, turns it to gold), all the subtle (and not-so-subtle, viz. The hysterical love scene) jabs at other action films. Leave your belief at the door; this is as over-the-top as they come, and it's supposed to be. If you passed it by when it came out because you're not an action movie fan, give it a go now; it's well worth your time. *** ½he door; this is as over-the-top as they come, and it's supposed to be.

0385504225|1.0|I have been a big fan of Dan Brown's all previous novels. The plot of his previous novels are thick and although too descriptive have always a good 'cause.  However this book has no plots and puzzles that just keeps going on and has a complete dud end. Also the characters come out as extremely weak.   for e.g. why would the hero just bring a critical artifact along without as much as an after-thought. Why would they break a seal which was kept unbroken for more than a century, with many sacrifices just  to save a man. The explanations given show the characters as very weak individuals.  And the ending was a complete failure..     And I agree with the another review comment - fire the editor.    Frankly after reading this, I don't think I am gonna read another Dan brown novel for a long time
B001KMB6X2|2.0|Babylon A.D. (Matthieu Kassovitz, 2008)<br /><br />Despite all the horrible things I'd heard about this movie, I had to wonder how you could pair the director of La Haine and the star of Multi-Facial and come up with something bad. And to be fair, \\"bad\\" is a kind of relative term. I can see where people who are only exposed to mainstream cinema might think it's one of the worst things they saw in 2008, but, like The Chronicles of Riddick, another unjustly trashed Diesel vehicle, this wasn't even the worst movie I saw this week. (By my count, in the past seven days, I've seen three movies that were demonstrably worse than this and two more of roughly the same level of quality.) Yeah, it's nothing more than a mindless action movie, certainly not of the quality I'd expect from a director like Kassovitz, but if you put aside the expectations that come with a director and cast of this quality, it's like Charlie Brown's christmas tree; scraggly, sure, but with a spark that's been missing from all the other aluminum trees on the lot.<br /><br />Plot: Toorop (Vin Diesel) is an American expat living in Russia, a mercenary who's been kicked out of his home country after finding himself on the terrorist list. He's hired by the similarly mercenary Gorsky (Gerard Depardieu) for a sensitive mission: to deliver a girl named Aurora (The Legend of 1900's Melanie Thierry) and her keeper, Sister Rebecca (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon's Michelle Yeoh) to New York City in six days. Along with half a million dollars, Gorsky will provide Toorop with a new genetic identity, which will enable him to move back to America permanently. That's quite a carrot, and Toorop takes the job. While there's some more to the plot later on, that's the basics, and the rest of the movie is doing the things Vin Diesel has been doing best for the past ten years: scenes where a whole lot of stuff blows up.<br /><br />You can't go into it with high expectations; Kassovitz' annoyance with Fox was well-publicized, and Fox ended up cutting almost half of Kassovitz' original cut in order to give the movie its less-than-ninety-minute running time. While I'd love to see the full hundred sixty minute cut Kassovitz originally turned in (the DVD clocks in at substantially less, with only eleven minutes of footage restored), I'm not all that sure it would make a great deal of difference; this is big, stylized Hollywood violence, without the intimacy of fist meeting flesh that made La Haine such a shocking film. Things go boom, and people run around shooting each other, and if you like that sort of thing, you'll probably get a kick out of this. It is kind of a disappointment to see Diesel only doing these big action-movie things after starting his career off by proving himself a fantastic actor in Multi-Facial, but like Keanu Reeves after a similar beginning with River's Edge and Permanent Record, that sort of role doesn't seem to be in the cards any more. (Ever think about going back to directing, Vin?) Still, for what it is, it gets the job done. Not in an exceptional or original way, but turn your brain off and you'll have a good time with it. **ing almost half of Kassovitz' original cut in order to give the movie its less-than-ninety-minute running time.

1401323820|5.0|It's a rare book that I really don't want to put down. I may have used that old saw to describe other books in the past, but it was never so true of a book as it was in this case. I took this on vacation (to Northern Maine for Thanksgiving) and I kept ignoring family so I could bury my nose in this. This is not deathless prose, but the mystery was engaging and the writing solid. When you compare it to books by other fake people (Jessica Fletcher, Gary Troup, James Patterson--oops! He used to be real) this is a real stand out.    Yes, I am a fan of the TV show which I only started watching because I think Nathan Fillion is dreamy. It's a funny, fast-moving, often surprisingly touching fantasy-cop mystery show--what genre doesn't it touch? You don't have to be a fan of the show to enjoy this. It is easy to see the characters of Castle and Beckett in Rook (ha ha castle/rook...get it?) and Heat especially since some of their banter seems lifted right from the show. And the mystery might as well be an extralong series entry...but you need no knowledge of the show to enjoy the book.    It is also a rare book that makes me laugh out loud. In fact, I think fewer than ten have (and I read a LOT of books for fun and for the three journals I write reviews for). This one got me several times. I will certainly never look at Sponge Bob in the same way again.    So it's fun and funny just enjoying the story (level one) and to enjoy it as a companion to the series (level two) and to snicker at people who find it \\"dishonest\\" in some bizzare way of ABC to put out a book \\"by\\" one of it's series characters* (level four) AND it is a knee-slappin' hoot to read stories (and get e-mails) about people going into bookstores and libraries looking for Castle's OTHER books (level five).    One final level of fun is the speculation as to the real author. Since the back flap lists Richard Castle as the author...but also mentions his first novel \\"In a Hail of Bullets\\" as the winner of the Nom DePlume Society's prestigious Tom Straw award...I think it's safe to assume the author of this is Tom Straw & I am going to go snatch up a copy of his other mystery \\"The Trigger Episode\\" because this was so good--maybe you should to!    *do these same people think it's dishonest of James Patterson to fob off the writing of all of his books on co-writers? Or of Nora Roberts {not her real name to begin with} to write as JD Robb among others? Grow up people!
B00005JKLZ|3.0|Time travel.  Oh, the possibilities; the consequences.  Which really pertains not at all to this Simon Wells adaptation of his great-grandfather's classic story.  But because I thought the 1960 Rod Taylor [[ASIN:0790747324 original]] was totally lame, I had flatline expectations of the 2002 version of THE TIME MACHINE.  And you know what?  This one's lame, too, but much more fun to watch.<br /><br />The main reason this version looks better is due to CGI done quite well.  It certainly has nothing to do with a dull, wooden Guy Pearce as protagonist Alexander Hartdegen--an instructor consumed with gadgets and machinery and marathon math equations who builds a time machine to go back in time to save the violent death of his betrothed (Sienna Guillory).  Yet once he realizes the futility of his intervention (his betrothed was going to die, one way or another, on that fateful night), he decides to explore the future--only to bang his head in 2037 because pieces of the moon are crashing into Earth and, quite unconscious mind you, flings himself some 800,000 years into the future.  From there, we're treated to the customary confrontation between the Eloi and the Morlocks, interspersed with Orlando Jones as an informational hologram (really lame), a stunning Samantha Mumba (wolf howl), and a smug Jeremy Irons in white makeup and predictable villain mode.  The fight Irons has with Pearce aboard the time machine is a howler, yet still fun to watch.<br /><br />It's the special effects that save THE TIME MACHINE from DVD coaster status.  They're crisp, clear, vivid, impressive, and wondrous to behold; plus the blended scenes ending--with Pearce and Mumba in one half of the shot exploring their new future while the other half depicts two characters in 1903 standing on the exact same spot speculating what's become of Professor Hartdegen--is a grand way to end the visuals.  THE TIME MACHINE ultimately is silly and nonsensical, but the special effects at least make the nonsense palatable.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoningkels, Author, The Reckoning
B002ELM5HY|5.0|Mark Knopfler's one of the dozen musicians whose work I have loved throughout their careers.  I have just about everything he's recorded and the remainder is on my Wish List.  \\"Get Lucky\\" is currently my favorite of them all.      This is an exceptional recording, good enough to audition speakers with heartfelt lyrics primarily from Mark's Celtic leanings.  From the opening flute on \\"Border Reiver\\" to the closing decay of pipes on \\"Piper to the End\\" I haven't found a single song on this CD I haven't considered an instant favorite.  And yes, I've played \\"Get Lucky\\" more than once to come to this conclusion.  Like Mark, \\"If there are no pipes in heaven, I'll go down below...\\"       Rebecca Kyle, December 2009
1593083653|4.0|Amelia and Becky are schoolmates together at a fancy young ladies' finishing school in England in the 1800s.  When the two leave together, Amelia is sobbed over, remembered fondly, and given a gift by the headmistress.  Amelia comes from a good family and is very wealthy.    Becky, on the other hand, is a poor orphan who had to earn her stay at the school by teaching French to the younger girls, and her graduation is not mourned by anyone.  Once free from the stifling environment of the school, Becky is able to look around and the world and find the best way of getting ahead in it.    This book follows the paths of Amelia and Becky as they each make their way through society and, for very different reasons, marry and gain families of their own.  Becky and Amelia both struggle to be liked, to be accepted, and to make their way through their socially complex England.    The story of these characters is fascinating, and it is especially compelling to watch Becky, who is always on the lookout for the most advantageous opportunities provided to her.  Amelia's story is much less turbulent, as she is not at all the conniver Becky is.    The book was a bit of a slog; it took a long time for me to read and I sometimes felt like I was missing some of the jokes.  The characters and the story were still very interesting, though, despite being written in the style of the time.
B002RSDW80|5.0|This entertaining true story is all about a woman who decides to cook every recipe in Julia Child's famous cookbook, giving herself just one year to do so.  Along the way, she has a bit of trouble with her boss over her blog, strains her relationship with her husband, and learns a lot about herself and Julia, as well as about French cooking.  The real Julia C. apparently did not care for the project, and we never really learn why.  But perhaps that mystery died along with her.  The actors are all superb here, the food will make you hungry, and the set design on 1940s/50s France and 2000-era New York is excellent.

1433502410|5.0|During the course of preparing a Sunday School lesson on the history of Bible translations, I discovered the ESV Bible.  As I did more and more research I kept finding glowing reviews of this translation, so I did some side-by-side verse comparisons and I really liked the ESV.  I also read many scholarly reports and it appears that the ESV translators have done one of the most literal (if not THE most literal) translation from the oldest and best Greek and Hebrew sources.  I was tiring of my 7th grade (or lower) reading level NIV (1984 translation) so I bought this.    And I love it.    PROs:  - Online access to all text, notes, pictures, etc  - Quality translation using the most recently discovered and verified sources  - Many quality study notes  - Hardcover makes reading it on my lap much easier  - Gorgeous illustrations  - 100s of pages of Articles on various other topics, including interpreting the Bible, Biblical ethics, languages of the Bible, the Septuagint, a salvation timeline, and Biblical doctrine  - Very recent translation can use recent archeological finds  - Literal translation (does not include \\"PC\\" gender neutral terms)  - Written for adults with a better vocabulary than some translations  - Study notes are organized well and have different headings depending on the span of the notes    CONs:  - Doesn't have red lettering for the words of Jesus    I have been recommending this to anyone I know that is interested in a new Bible because I think it is a great translation and study source.  Even if you don't need it, I would recommend it.

B002EA4IO8|5.0|1)  One major conflict in this book would be when Bruno and his family moved far away from their home in Berlin, and went to a new home called Out-With.  This conflict doesn't get resolved because Bruno went to the other side of the fence and got himself killed.  2)  Bruno is a lot like Zech from \\"A Land Remembered.\\"  They are alike because both of them are curious and always wonders about things in the world.  They also are both adventurous and they like to try new things.  If they met they would most likely get along and help each other out.  One difference between them is that Zech gets to grow up and Bruno does not.  3)  \\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\\" was one of my favorite books of all time.  It's full of emotion and tons of suspense.  While reading this book I felt as if I was really there.  It was one of the best books of the year.   4)  I would most definetly recommend this book to someone else.  It is just a great book!  It has been expertly written.  It also has a wonderful storyline.  I believe everyone would enjoy reading this book.  I think everyone would like it because once you get into it, you don't want to stop.  5)  One theme of this book that relates to me is having a friend that your really not allowed to have.  When I was little, like about 7 or 8, I had a friend named Jameson.  He was my best friend, but both of our parents didn't like each other so they didn't want us to be friends.  Even though our parents didn't like each other, we were still friends anyway.  This was like the theme because I had a friend I wasn't suppose to have.

I ordered it from Amazon.com, it arrived promptly and I have listened to it several times, both with and without ear phones.      I am NOT disappointed in Susan's voice.

I was surprised that she sang the refrain for \\"How Great Thou Art\\" three times but never sang a verse.       I wish her the best of success in her future musical career.  I hope she will be invited to duo with Russell Watson, another of my favorite performers from the UK. I also hope to one day have a DVD of her....She's a \\"modern\\" Kate Smith!

1594488916|4.0|The Man Who Loved Books Too Much is a dual tale, focussing both on the world of rare book collecting and the bibliophiles who dominate it, and on the strange tale of a bibliomane, a man who loves books so much that he resorts to stealing them in order to create his dream of a world class collection.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book, though I grew impatient with the book thief's constant self-justifications and arrogance.  I got the most pleasure out of the interviews with the owners of the rare book stores he preyed upon.  It was also interesting to read of the efforts of the book store owners to track down the book thief and bring him to justice, though it was somewhat frustrating to see him get off time and again with light sentences.<br /><br />I'll keep The Man Who Loved Books in the section of my own library devoted to accounts of bibliophilia, a delightful disease I have \\"suffered\\" from for many years.
B002HWUU1I|4.0|I first heard of Swell Season three years ago when I went to a Damien Rice concert. Swell Season was the opening act and I had never heard of them. I was blown away. Glen Hansard is a fantastic singer and a masterful storyteller during his live shows. That night, I bought their first CD. I was impressed with nearly every track and I went out and bought a CD from Hansard's other band, The Frames.    Then a few months later, I saw that Hansard and Marketa were appearing in a film together called Once, which features  a great deal of music from that Swell Season CD. I was overjoyed to see the band would then go on to win an Oscar.    So is there a sophomore slump or hangover with Strict Joy, the duo's second CD? Not at all. It is excellent. Every track is great and I was impressed that most of the music is softer than what Hansard has done with The Frames. It's a different side to him that should be explored more, I think, in future projects. As for Marketa, she is great but I prefer listening to his voice. Either way, this album is worth investigating if you like folk, or indie music.    It is also worth mentioning that this CD was included in NPR's 50 best all songs considered collection for 2009.
0446691437|5.0|Mr. Pressfield is to be commended for a great book! There is much noise in the self-help arena, but this book transcends the genre and puts common sense tools into the hands of the reader. Rarely have I read an author who possesses the power to convey such profound ideas in such an accessible way. I don't agree with some of the metaphysical stuff, but that's part of the appeal.

So it's interesting to meet the Characters knowing how the ending will come out. I gave this book a 5 because I am a Cancer Servivor and can identify with the book. Macomber tells it like it is for us ladies who were single when we got cancer and how we have a tendency to stay away from men. The series will introuduce new characters from a widow who adopts a child, a late in life romance, a society snob who falls in love with her husband again, a single women who is engaged to a creep and finds the strength to break it off and fall in love with a real man, a young lady abused throughout childhood is blessed with a dream husband, A cancer survior who gets married, and much more.

(By the way, as a New Yorker and as one who had an intimate connection to 9/11--my husband worked on the 105th floor of the South Tower, but was late that day--this film is not a downer; it's uplifting, and doesn't trade on the tragedy of 9/11 at all.

B002HWRYJE|4.0|I have ordered many items from Amazon in the past, and I have generally been very satisfied with both the product and the delivery time.  However, I was disappointed with this order.  There was big hype to compete with other companies with this product by slashing prices.  The pricing was great, but then I thought Amazon dropped the P.R. ball by not shipping on the day this product was released.  I could have gone to Wal-Mart and bought the movie on the day of release for the almost same price.  I would have spent $0.01 more!  Instead, I had to wait day after day until the movie was finally shipped.  I got the movie on an order with free shipping, so I knew it would take awhile before delivery was made.  However, the movie should have been shipped on the day of release, and it was not!  I won't stop making purchases through Amazon.com, but I would hope the next time a promotional event like this is made, Amazon.com will be more aggressive in delivering the product to the customer.
B001DDBCUK|4.0|Sex in the city is a result of women's lib that began in the sixties (or is that cities?) that resulted in all sorts of problems for modern women in relationships, but also resulted in a lot of positive steps for women in the workplace.  This is the result - a movie and show that some women in today's culture can relate to.  And this is why this show is popular - it glamorizes something that many women can relate to.  On the other hand, you could argue, that it may promote selfishness, unrealistic expectations about life in general, sexual promiscuity, and may push women into this type of behavior by making them think they are prima donnas because they deserve the best in life.  Regardless of the social content, I found this film to be enjoyable.. even if it was a little more pornographic than I was expecting (not saying I'm complaining of course... but still).  Read some of henry Mackow on the subject and his take on the show..  [...]
B000YRY8BG|5.0|This almost six-hour-long BBC miniseries is brilliant! Great cast: David Morrissey, Kelly MacDonald, James McAvoy, Bill Nighy (remember the naken guitarist in \\"Love Actually\\"?) and John Simm, among other familiar British faces.     An independent committee, headed by an up-and-coming Member of Parliament (Morrissey)is investigating British oil companies. One of the committee's researchers, an attractive young woman (of course), falls under the wheels of a train in the Underground. Accident? Suicide? Murder? It quickly becomes clear that the married MP was having an affair with his research assistant, and the avid British journalists start digging, armed with imagination, ruthlessness and a generous budget for buying information, which is more than Woodward and Bernstein had.    It's addictive. I watched it three times through, and then had to slap my fingers to keep from putting it on again. By the second or third time, working class British English becomes understandable.... or you can do what I did, back up the DVD, close your eyes, and listen until you get it. They are speaking, fundamentally, the same language, after all. And you really want to know what they said.
0195073401|3.0|First off, full disclosure: I am NOT an economics PhD student. I'm in a business discipline and was forced to take a micro theory class using this book. The first three chapters are fairly easy if you know partial differentiation (and even if you don't, it's not that hard). However, it goes downhill quickly after that. On one hand, I want to give this book one star for making my life miserable over the past semester. On the other hand, even if I only understand 10% of it, I feel that I learned a ton from this text - not just about econ, but also about economic models and math. So, three stars it is, and I'll count my blessings that I am done with this book after one semester, unlike the econ guys who are stuck with it for a full year.
B000000993|2.0|My main advice is to listen to the samples and make a decision. If you listen to the samples and expect the music will be better on the full album, you might be unpleasantly surprised. I figured that the music would grow on me because I liked other alternative rock bands. I listened to the album several times before I finally admitted that it just didn't work for me.<br /><br />Amazon and a couple of friends told me that I would probably like Tool, based on the kind of music I listen to normally. My friends and a couple of reviews that I read indicated that Undertow was the group's best album. I expected to like this music, unfortunately I find it either boring or think it is just irritating noise. I like several bands that are supposed to be similar, such as Bush, Rage Against the Machine, Pearl Jam, Audio Slave, Nirvana, Blink 182, and The Offspring. Unfortunately, I find that the lead singer doesn't stand out vocally very well and the music sounds mostly like noise. Again, listen to the samples and try to figure out if you like what you hear. If you do, then it will probably work for you. If you are unsure, you might want to keep listening to samples until you have a better idea about it.
1932907009|4.0|I used to love to write, but I can thank a college professor for putting the kabash on that one.  Until recently, that is.  I often think of wonderful story ideas, and write them down when they are more than just okay.  But then I don't know what to do with those ideas, how to expand on them.<br /><br />Recently I saw a writing class advertised.  So I signed up and bought the course book, which was Save the Cat by Blake Snyder.  This was a start, I told myself.  Little did I know that I was about to read one of the industry \\"bibles\\" on screenwriting.  Also, little did I know that the morning after my second class the wonderful and generous Blake Snyder was going to leave us, taking to heaven before I could ask him all of my questions (I tried the email in the book but guess he didn't have a \\"ghost writer\\" yet :)<br /><br />Anyway, all in all I found the book so wonderful that I picked up the next one \\"Save the Cat Goes to the Movies\\"....to refine my ideas and channel things efficiently.<br /><br />Just buy it.  You'll see!
B002VKE1K2|1.0|I have never in my life hated a movie or a video game or anything so badly that I gave it a ZERO. Paranormal Activity changed that. (Okay, technically I gave it a 1, but that's only because the scale doesn't go all the way down to zero. In my mind, I just gave it a zero because there's nothing good about this movie.)    The movie was absolutely terrible. I was bored out of my mind for the entire movie. Half the scenes in the movie were the two main characters (a couple) bickering (and no one pays for a horror movie to see people bicker--unless they die as a result of or shortly after they bicker). The other half of the scenes (the ones that were supposed to be scary) was just sitting around for a few minutes waiting for something to happen. And then something incredibly lame (on the order of furniture moving by itself) would happen. I actually found myself checking my watch every few minutes to see how much longer I'd have to suffer through this. (30 minutes into the movie, I considered walking out of the movie as a result of the excruciating boredom, but I decided against it since I was here with friends and they needed to give me a ride home.)    The \\"scary\\" scenes themselves were pretty underwhelming. Aside from the fact that they were so few and so short and so lame, they were completely predictable, completely cliche. Every \\"scary\\" thing that happened I could see coming from a mile away, and my reaction was more of \\"seriously, that's the best they could come up with?\\" rather than one of fear. The sole exception, the one time when something happened that I didn't expect, it actually amused me to the point that I burst out in laughter. Only the most sheltered of people would find this stuff scary. Either that or people who come in with the mindset of wanting or expecting to be scared. But someone in that mindset could also be scared by your friendly neighbor saying \\"hi\\".    The movie has been described to me by multiple sources as \\"weird sounds in the middle of the night\\". Yeah, I hear weird sounds at night every frickin' night, and I'm still not scared. Maybe if a monster jumped out and dragged me out of my bed, then I'd be scared. But I'd be scared of getting dragged out of my bed by a monster with or without this movie.    Maybe all of this garbage would have been worth it if there was a nice payoff at the end. But no, the payoff was literally in the last few seconds of the movie. And to top it off, that payoff was something I'd already predicted as soon as the movie began.    Now don't misunderstand me. I love horror movies. I even enjoy the really really bad ones. But even I hated Paranormal Activity. It was painfully boring, predictable to the point of cliche, and simply not scary at all. I'll even take a page from the book of Comic Book Guy and call it the Worst Movie Ever.    I don't regret it, though. I actually love writing reviews about grossly overrated pieces of entertainment where I just completely trash them. And Paranormal Activity gave me that opportunity.
B002K0WBXW|2.0|I agree with the person who said that if you've seen while you were sleeping, you've seen this movie!  Throughout the whole movie, things kept happening that happened in while you were sleeping!  Like when she said she couldn't marry him at the alter, here we go again!  Anyways, it was kinda annoying..
B00005JLEU|5.0|Anime is always stereotyped as nothing but ADD-indused action, annoying music, characters that surprisingly look the same, and a bad example of style-over-substance. This isn't the case with Miyazaki's Spirited Away. This is a very distinct anime film. Not only is it devoid of many stereotypes that anime in general is associated with, but it's a highly imaginative tale, with some fascinating details that you regularly don't see in Naruto or Bleach (both of which I dislike, by the way). Here's the story: a ten-year-old girl named Chihiro and her parents are moving into a new residence, and she's the only one who condemns the decision. Once they get lost by taking a shortcut through the forest, they come across a mysterious bathhouse. Things start to get worse as Chihiro's parents transform into pigs as they indulge themselves with food, and the way back to their car has been blocked. There is only one way out of this: get a job at the bathhouse that is now up and running again, and hopefully her parents will turn back into their normal selves.<br /><br />With a length of just over two hours, Spirited Away is a visual spectacle of fantasy, drama, and comedy. Miyazaki brings his vivid imagination to life with memorable characters, gorgeous settings, and sequences that feel like they've come straight out of a dream (the train station is one example). I did have a couple of problems with this movie, however. The main character, Chihiro, got on my nerves a few times. She is a third-dimensional character, yes, but can't she PLEASE stop crying and screaming whenever she feels sad and scared?! The other problem I have with this movie is the music. I don't why, but sometimes the music doesn't sound very melodic. It's not the sort of music that you would remember for all time.<br /><br />Well, despite those two flaws, this is still an excellent animated film. It may not be one of my favorites, but I can still acknowledge that this is one of the finest films to have ever been created since the beginning of this new millennium. Everyone should have a chance to watch it.<br /><br />Grade: A-beginning of this new millennium. Everyone should have a chance to watch it.    Grade: A-

Each image is huge like thy were in the Disney Archive \\"Story\\" book and showcase their line quality. It's definately one of my prized possessions now!
1402217722|5.0|Ever since I began reading heyer -- in 1966, when I was 15! -- this is the novel I have loved the most. Although set earlier than many of her novels, the beguiling story of Horatia Winwood, who offers herself to Marcus Rule in her sister's stead to save the Winwood fortunes, has all the panache and wit that charcterizes Heyer at her bets. Originally written in 1933, I feel that some of the descriptions about the erotic frissons between Horry and Rule HAD to have been read by Margaret mitchell, whose GWTW in 1936 has passages that read almost identically to Heyer's!  Hilarious comic characterisations, especially the effete Crosby Drelincourt and Pelham Winwood, Horry's dim but dashing brother.  Amazon found me a British first edition which i treasure, but I buy the stylish new copies as gifts. A Must-read for Heyer fans.
B0029LHW68|5.0|Wow I absolutely love this new album. I have been a mars fan since way back when they released their first album and im so glad they made this new record. In all honesty i was disappointed when they released \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" since it was so different from their first album that was so unique and rockin. After a while \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" grew on me but i must say that it only took one listen on \\"This Is War\\". Its totally a step in the right direction for these guys. Yes, its different, but I love how it combines elements from their first two albums. The songs are put together very well and I love singing along to it. I cant wait to see them perfrom it live! Im sad to see fans falling off the bandwagon, but Im glad its new and different. Who wants to listen to a band that stays the same? Not me, and thats why I love what they have evolved into!\\"Kings and Queens\\" rocks, \\"This is War\\" is an amazing song, i love the ending with the emotion and lead into the soft \\"100 suns\\". \\"Closer to the edge\\" rocks my socks off and then Alibi has an amazing buildup! Lots of highlights on this one!
0312944926|1.0|First of all, I wish I'd read Rimesh Patel's review [...] before starting this book.     This book was actually painful to read. I really enjoyed the Da Vinci Code because I am very familiar with the background materials he used and he seemed to get the Templar and biblical elements right. Here he just seemed to make things up. I won't go in to Brown's clearly inadequate understanding of the technology and politics that are fundamental keystones to this story. Mr. Patel covers that well enough. My biggest objection was the poor writing. Again Mr. Patel discusses that on a technical level. I think he misses one point that is very high on my list of cardinal sins writers must not commit.     His characters aren't just boring -- they are perfect. Perfect. They are all successful, went to the right schools, make gobs of money. They are beautiful, with motives as pure as the driven snow. And they seem to absolutely lack human qualities like doubt or fear. These people are BORING. Their love is unqualified and untested. And for these things to be true, it seems pointless to consider their failure. Without that possibility, suspense becomes impossible. For that reason, this hardly has the right to call itself a thriller.    Part of this annoying perfection is the main character's simplistic world-view justifying the main premise behind this story -- that the NSA can and should be privy to ALL communications, regardless of who is doing the communication or what is being communicated.      I understand that people in the intelligence agencies may, and perhaps should, feel this way. But I am frightened to think that they believe this without any reservations. I like to think even the people in the NSA have souls and consider the implications of their actions. I hope these people realize there are lines which even the NSA should not cross.     David Becker and almost every other character in this book are not people I want in our intelligence community. They really have no souls. These views are what finally bring me to condemn this book. I cannot disagree more with the characters' (and presumably the author's) notions about an individual's right to privacy, or the constitution of this country.
B001EXE2ZG|5.0|Billy Wilder, one of the best filmmakers ever, crafted here one of the best film noirs ever made. Filled to the brim with scathing insight into Hollywood, biting satire, sweeping dramatic arcs, and uncanny resemblance to real life, this is one blistering depiction of a by-gone era that is still as relevant today as it was upon its release in 1950.<br />Gloria Swanson, a real life former silent film star, plays Nora Desmond, a former silent film star who is living soley on memories and faded dreams from the past. The industry has tossed her aside when films moved into the 'talking' era. William Holden, who in real life was a promising young actor who was on a downslope, plays a burned out promising screenwriter who is on bit of a downslope, broke, running from debt collectors, stumbling into Nora's 'world' literally. He becomes her 'writer' and lover and confidant, and eventual enemy.<br />Filled with real life film stars from the period, and film director Cecil B. Demille playing himself, this is also a scathing look at the whole inside of the Hollywood industry and the machinisms that are within it.<br />Hailed by many as a classic, and rightly so, this timeless masterpiece is ripe for discovery for any film fan out there. Brian DePalma used a set piece, the luxurious hotel, in his noir film \\"The Black Dahlia\\". Other films have paid homage to this over the years, but none can compare to this...Truly a classic for all to enjoy.<br />\\"Mr DeMille, I'm ready for my close up\\"...<br />Highly recommended!<br />Thank you...;o)
B000641D2Y|5.0|Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is mostly an exact duplicate of the original film. Kevin (Culkin) gets into trouble in the beginning, he ignores his family, his family is separated from him, he enjoys his independence, and his two most ruthless rivals come and ruin all the fun. But this time, Kevin makes it to the airport and gets on the wrong plane. So now he's in New York City for the holidays, while his family is all the way down in Florida. I'd say that Lost in New York is as equally entertaining as the first. It has the same amount of charm, and the booby traps are a bit more inventive. Tim Curry becomes a bit of a sensation in a small antagonistic role, while Rob Schneider is pretty annoying whenever he appears (isn't he always?). But the film as a whole is a bit more beautiful-looking, with a few darker elements added in. I don't think I can decide which film is better, since I think they are equally brilliant. So I will say that this is yet another Christmas classic that anyone can watch during the holiday season. It's a great family film that isn't as memorable as the first movie, but it's just as good.<br /><br />Grade: A-
B00001NFCY|4.0|Shortly after Creed released the mediocre `Higher' I saw them in concert.  It was one of the best live acts I've ever seen.  They actually made me enjoy that song, despite my better judgment.  When a song like `Higher' is the worst you can come up with, you know that you are doing something right, because even that song (in all it's safe, cheesy ridiculousness) is still somewhat enjoyable and catchy as all get out.<br /><br />`Human Clay' was Creed's sophomore album, their follow up to `My Own Prison', and while nothing on this album even comes close to the blistering brilliance of songs like `One' and `Unforgiven', `Human Clay' does offer us a different side to Creed, and it introduces us to the new direction they were taking; a sadly more commercial yet interestingly more diverse one.<br /><br />Instead of maintaining their alternative edge, Creed adopted more of a Top-40 sound, which can be heard on `Higher' and `With Arms Wide Open'.  They stripped away edge to unveil sentimentality, and while it works sometimes (`With Arms Wide Open' may push it a tad, but it is still beautiful) it comes off a little misplaced at times.  This album also suffers from a few tracks that are just mediocre in concept and a few that are too reminiscent of other, better, tracks to stand out on their own.<br /><br />With a handful of good material and a slew of lazy contributions, `Human Clay' is easily Creed's worst album.<br /><br />The album opens with `Are You Ready?', a track that is extremely forgettable.  It lacks any real punch, even if it sports an aggressive nature.  It's too, what's the word, cheap.  Songs like `Wrong Way' and `Inside us All' fall under that same category.  They just seem like filler B-side type tracks that were thrown on at the last minute to add some length to the album.  `Wash Away Those Years' has some value, but it is to familiar sounding to me, and `Higher' is just a whole bowl of cheesy stew.  I love how this was labeled `typical Creed' when it sounds NOTHING like what they delivered on their debut.<br /><br />This one is far too `pop/rock' sounding.<br /><br />`What If' has real teeth, but it also gets obnoxious and repetitive.  `Say I' has the same problem (I'll never understand the idea that all a chorus needs to be is a repeated phrase).  I really like both songs and they have a quality that reminds me of a polished version of their debut, but both also have that one flaw that knocks them down a peg.  `Never Die' is slightly elevated, but it also loses some edge in areas.<br /><br />The best on the album is the trifecta of `Beautiful', `Faceless Man' and `With Arms Wide Open'.  `With Arms Wide Open' is easily the worst of the three, for it does lay on the sentiment a little too thick, but it is a really well done song that is meant to be emotional and so I forgive Creed.  `Beautiful' is easily the most respectable of the three, and the most reflective of where this album should have gone.  It is a very nice example of Creed maintaining their `edge' yet showing a sophomore polish that comes from more money and more studio support.  It is a song that shows growth.  That said; `Faceless Man' is easily the best.  I love the guitar work, and Stapp's soft and sincere vocals are just so moving.  His lyrical message also feels much closer to his debut than the rest of the album.  One thing that was so impressive about Creed's debut was that they had such a clear message that showed no signs of tampering (aside from their `lords name in vain' dilemma on `What's This Life For?').  For me, `Human Clay' feels heavily influenced.<br /><br />But I could be wrong.<br /><br />In the end I give this one a B-.  I know that, from my review, a B- may seem like a high rating, but like I said, even the bad tracks here have layers of catchy likeability.  It's hard to dislike this album, but to say it is without flaws is a statement blinded by bias.red on their debut.

B002MJV75O|1.0|The packaging and delivery were great, but as I opened up the box and put the first DVD in I was disappointed with the content. The more DVDs I watched the more disappointed I became, until I had finally watched them all (it took me 3 days) and I had to purge. I wanted this to be a good show but unfortunately it is horrible. I can't decide if it's the acting, the actors, the writing, or the music. Or it could be the plot. I'm not sure which one is ruining it for me.

0884271153|5.0|I have seen several of the reviews that slammed Its Not Luck, and I am surprised.  I've read most of Dr. Goldratt's books and I cant believe that someone would find the book to have little value.  But this book will not spoon feed you.  You have to actually think.  You will need to follow the steps to create a breakthrough in sales.  And it is an unconventional breakthrough to build an operational capability that actually solves a customer's need, especially if the customer does not recognize that someone can actually solve that need.    To get sales, if you are saying the same things as your competition (functions, features, service, etc.) then you should expect to compete on price.  If you really try to use your brain, this book will help you find a way to differentiate yourself like no competition.  But you have to do the work.    This book is not a pipe dream, I have seen this book applied in multiple cases.  It does work.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Dance of Death being Iron Maiden's 13th studio album and their 2003 release is a back to basics Heavy Metal album with a rough metal sound and longer tracks which is very similair to early Metallica in that songs are often more then 5 minutes long. All the lyrics are included and we also get many nice photos of the band in group and in individual shots. Unfortunately no list of whom plays what is included. Allmusic and Sputnikmusic gave the album 4/5 and I agree. The best tracks on this release are \\"Wildest Dreams\\" and \\"Rainmaker\\". 4/5.
0385341008|4.0|This was a good book.  The author developed every character; I teared up in a few spots. The book is written as a series of letters between friends- I pretended like I was reading my grandmother's old letters. It was a very effective way of writing a historical novel without just putting down facts. I researched Guernsey during the war online, and it seems most websites only state a small paragraph about the island's occupation. This book reminds me of The Diary of Anne Frank.
0385532458|5.0|For those of us who are ardent Grisham readers, this was \\"new\\" territory. Of course, I was not surprised at the quality of the stories but I was pleasantly surprised that he did it. It was a joy to read Grisham's selection of \\"tales\\" from Ford County and it felt natural after reading so many of his novels that took place there. His characters were definitely varied but believable and that made for some out loud chuckles more than a few times. My only hope is that he will venture out with more short stories again and thereby grant me some more reading \\"fun\\".

We haven't given in but it is clear she is really paying attention to a lot more details than just the pretty colors and schemes.  She is actually reciting the story to me and laughs at appropriate jokes.  I love seeing the joy in her face.  The movie is great and not too many scary scenes for the little ones as some of the other Disney movies.  This one is a winner!
B000063DI9|4.0|Seventh Son of a Seventh Son is the 7th studio album by Iron Maiden and was released in 1988 and to me it is an album that is a rock album with heavy metal elements but not an album that is a pure Heavy Metal album. The booklet contains no lyrics but does have a list of whom plays what. The album was met with poisitive reviews by Allmusic, Kerrang! and Sputnikmusic. Even though I find their sound to be Heavy Metal light this is not a bad album with great melodies and some great guitar solos. The songs I like the most are the following: \\"Can I Play With Madness\\", \\"The Evil That Men Do\\" and \\"The Clairvoyant\\". 4/5.

He does all the right things, but is he just putting on a \\"show\\" to get the Gladers to trust him? Several of the Gladers who have been though the Changling think so...I found myself not wanting to doubt our faithful hero, Tomas or his intentions toward the other Gladers. I can't say more, don't want to give it away....<br /><br />Then there's Teresa, you don't see to much of her, but I like the \\"connection\\" her and Tomas share...it adds another unexpected twist - she adds a different element and I can't wait to see their relationship develop...Is Teresa to be trusted as the Gladers continue on there journey?<br /><br />Chuck was one of my favorite characters, as well as Minho and Newt - Chuck leaves me heart broken, he's such a fun character, Thomas often gets tired of him and his talking, but somehow Chuck worms his way into Thomas' heart - they become brothers...Minho and Newt are an excellent support case, along with many of the Gladers...<br /><br />The Maze Runner leaves you wondering, a deep \\"NEED TO KNOW\\" wondering - with tons of questions still on your lips...then you read the epilogue - and it's even worse...<br /><br />For me, this book is a \\"must read\\"...All in all I give it a 5.lent support case, along with many of the Gladers...

B00005ATQM|5.0|Pros: It's Metallica -- IN SURROUND SOUND!<br /><br />Cons: No extras, unless you count an ad for one of their DVDs.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: If you are a Metallica fan, and you own a player compatible with DVD-Audio, GO BUY THIS!<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Original 02/04/05 review:<br />Metallica has been quite busy over the past decade releasing a lot of studio albums, a few live albums, several concert DVDs and now a DVD -Audio. The first album that Metallica chose to release as DVD - Audio is the already very well produced self titled album, also known by Metallica fans as \\"the Black Album\\". Barely visible on the matte black cover in a dark grey is the band's logo and a \\"Don't Tread on Me\\" snake. I've always liked Metallica and view them as a \\"thinking persons\\" heavy metal band. This review will focus on the sound quality of the DVD-Audio rather than the album itself. Metallica albums have been reviewed rather heavily as the band has gained and/or lost fans as they have grown (or \\"sold out\\"). I will state that I am one of the fans who believe that they have grown.<br /><br />That said, how does an already well done album sound in the new DVD-Audio format? Let me start with a description of my favorite two tracks on the album as they sound in surround! The album opens with the song \\"Enter Sandman\\". The opening guitar chords of the song float in the center of the room, then a few guitar riffs come in from the rear left and the rear right surround speakers. Then Lars drums boom from the front center, and bass guitar fills the rear. You will want a good center channel speaker for this DVD-Audio, because Urich's drums are consistently located front and center of the sound stage. The opening vocals of the song burst in from center stage, and choruses just seem to float into the whole sound field. The Lord's prayer is recited in the rear left channel and the child repeats the prayer in the rear right channel, as the drums and bass stay center stage. Vocals then move around a bit, sometimes coming in front left or right, other times rear left or right. Overall, Metallica really takes advantage of the full surround sound stage. The right and left rear channels are very actively used, and not just as ambient fill.<br /><br />On my favorite Metallica song \\"Unforgiven\\", the opening guitars (reminicent of the Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns) come in center front and expand to the full center stage. Then Lars drums come in solid center front and the vocals seem to emerge from the center of the room. The choruses seem to fill the entire sound field. The rear right and left channels occasionally burst into life with a guitar riff.<br /><br />Similar surround effects were used throughout the album. Mostly, the drums and lead vocals would stay in center stage, but backing vocals and choruses would move around or literally surround you. Guitars and bass would often come in from the rear channels. Metallica does all of this in a way that sounds like a natural use of the surround sound and it never comes out as gimmicky or forced. By moving the instruments into six channels instead of two, I gained a greater appreciation of how well produced this album is. The orchestral work on \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" for example, takes on a clarity I had never really noticed in the stereo version. The Lord's prayer also gains a new depth when it is separated away from the heavy drums and bass. On the songs with melodic guitar solos, the guitar work clearly stands out in greater depth than it did in the stereo mix. You can hear the notes resonate! The Advanced Resolution Surround Sound mix is only playable on equipment designed to play DVD-Audio.<br /><br />The DVD-Audio also has an advanced resolution stereo track (for DVD-Audio only) and a 5.1 Dolby Digital mix for use in any DVD player. I didn't notice much improvement on the stereo mix, but this is not a criticism of the DVD-Audio, its more of a compliment of the original CD.<br /><br />Metallica was very light on the bonus features with this disc! A \\"video\\" is included which is nothing more than a teaser trailer for an upcoming video by them about the \\"Making of the Black Album\\". You get to hear Urich declare that the black album is their \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", and a few bits about how hard it was to produce, but to get the full story, you need to wait for the \\"Making of\\", because its just an advertisement! Although Lyrics are included, a photo gallery is not. I would have also liked to see at least a couple music videos thrown in, but none are.<br /><br />Since DVD-Audio cannot be copied and distributed on the internet, I am positive that Lars Urich will release more of Metallica's albums in this format. Based on the sound of the black album, I think thats great! If you are a Metallica fan, and have DVD-Audio and surround sound, the black album is a worthwhile purchase. Please buy it though, don't borrow it from your friend, or listen to it for free somewhere without properly compensating the band for the intellectual property they have commercially distributed for home use and enjoyment only. Lear Jets cost money you know.<br /><br />Added notes: This was originally reviewed on a Yamaha Surround Sound Receiver with a Pioneer Elite 47A DVD player. At the time of my original review above, I had Cambridge Soundworks speakers hooked up except the front R&L channels which were Advent Legacies. Since upgrading to Polk speakers,a Velodyne subwoofer and a Rotel amplifier for the fronts, my feelings for this album have only grown. In fact the Velodyne subwoofer really brings out the bass I hadn't noticed in my original review. - Shopaholic_Man, epinions 2/4/05a was very light on the bonus features with this disc!

B00000D9TQ|4.0|I'm personally more of a Genesis fan than a Phil Collins solo fan, but he certainly did have some great solo songs. His first two albums, in particular, were an important bridge between his more difficult Genesis material and his soul-influenced adult contemporary work. Singles such as 'In The Air Tonight', 'I Missed Again', 'I Don't Care Anymore', 'Thru These Walls' and the reworked 'Behind The Lines' are great examples of this transitional period. So it's a bit of a pity that only the first of these appears on 'Hits'. In fact, only two songs from his first two albums (his cover of 'You Can't Hurry Love' is the other) are present here. So rather than being seen as part of a gradual development, 'In The Air Tonight' actually sounds a bit jarring and out-of-place among the soft-rock that makes up the rest of the album.     Phil Collins' solo work is the sort of stuff that you either love or hate, and there's certainly nothing here to convince the \\"haters\\". But those who jumped on board with 'Against All Odds' will find most of their favourites here. Obviously, the album is dominated by singles from the squillion-selling duo 'No Jacket Required' and 'But Seriously' ('One More Night', 'Sussudio', 'Take Me Home', 'Something Happened...', 'Another Day In Paradise', 'I Wish It Would Rain Down') plus singles from that period ('Against All Odds', 'Easy Lover', 'Two Hearts', 'Groovy Kind Of Love'). No arguing with these songs, and the album does a good job of collating those loose singles, movie tracks, and covers that do not appear on any other Collins album. A couple of later-day, minor hits like 'Dance Into The Light' round out the collection, and are fair enough inclusions.     Most of what's here deserves to be, but it's hard not to miss some of those early songs, plus other songs from the mid-80's like 'Don't Lose My Number'. It might have been a better idea to issue this as a 2 CD set of (say) 24 songs, or maybe including a Bonus CD containing some of these rarer andearlier tracks. A 16 song single CD contains a lot of music, but still doesn't quite do justice to Collins' massive solo success.     I still give it four stars, because what is actually here is still very good.
0810982862|2.0|Sure, the art that's there is impressive, but there not much of it. Overblown single images spanning two pages that would have been better as a half page, little text, and barely over 100 pages. Sorry, but compared to most \\"art of\\" books out that this is a paltry little rip-off that should have been sold as a magazine. Where is the REST of the art? That can't be more than 10% (at best) of what was produced. Did the author only want to feature a handful of images from her favorite artists and ignore everyone else that had input into the film? Was it laziness, just rushed to the presses, favoritism or some absurd studio politics that made this volume so weak?
0440237688|5.0|i remember having to read this book in middle school. since then, ive read it a few more times. i decided to buy it because its such a wonderful book. the imagination in this story has always perplexed me, and its like this whole new world when you read it, but yet one that you COULD imagine our world turning in to one day... i just finished it again the other day, and its still a great book. Jonas's reactions in the story seem like reactions that the reader invisions he would have done in the circumstance himself...
0553385461|4.0|Stephen Hawking's A Briefer History of Time was written for people who wanted a simpler version of A Brief History of Time with main key concepts. In this book, Hawking goes through topics such as the shape and orbit of earth (Aristotle, Ptolemy, Copernicus), Newton and his views on the universe, relativity (Einstein), curved space, how the universe is expanding, the Big Bang and blackholes, gravity, time travel, dimensions, unification of physics, and God. His writing was somewhat simple for those who have not been introduced in depth to time, the expanding universe, and those kind of things before (ex. Hawking referring to the tension in a string as a thousand million million million million million million tons as a 1 with thirty-nine zeros after it).   I feel like this book really stretched my mind. It was a hard read, no doubt, but I liked contemplating things Hawking wrote and realizing that I had grown smarter for it. The most interesting section to me was about time being faster closer to the earth. Apparently, if you sent a twin up in space and kept one on earth and the twin in space came back, he would have aged less than the one on earth. Hawking could have been more clear when he wrote about dimensions and curves. It confused me, but with some careful rereading, I bet I could derive more from it.  All in all, good read and recommended if you want to do some deep thinking.
B0007TKNCY|5.0|Cary Grant is hilarious as an awkward professor.  He is matched in talent by a giddy, girly - and very pretty - Katherine Hepburn.  The entire cast, underscored by a live leopard, is superb.  The entire scenario is so ridiculous, one can't help but laugh.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This is a movie I have been waiting for a long time. It is absolutely gorgeous in HD/Blu-ray. The picture quality is amazing along with the sound, and if u have a home theater system it is even better. This film has a great story, great actors, and great action. This truly is a must buy for any one who has a Blu-ray collection. 5/5 Stars.
B000VECAEO|1.0|The rate is about the DVD Edition, not the show. Is one of my favorites shows of all time.<br /><br />A shame of edition.<br />Contain in every disc, without the chance of fast-forward or interrupt, a long antipiracy comercial that starts before the first episode you select after inserting the disc.<br /><br />Very annoying. Probably I have watched the same commercial at least 15 times in the last weeks.<br /><br />Why I have to be forced to watch that commercial so many times when I bought an original edition?<br /><br />I bought the last two season recently and the same also occurs in the 8th season.

1590171993|5.0|One of the most powerful books I've read. The first 50 pages or so are a little slow but once it gets rolling it never stops. Is it exciting and full of twists and turns? No! It's a simple story that's a testament to the indomitability and integrity of the human spirit. Do I feel changed by it? Yes! It makes me more aware that no matter what happens in life or what other people say or do, one must be true to one's own self.

B00001ODGR|5.0|This dvd was absolutely fabulous. A friend of mine was watching it with me and was really into the show so I got one for him. I am somewhat biased about Styx (if I could only listen to one musical group, it would be them) but even though the concert was from 1996, I thought the digital quality was excellent. My only regret was that I couldn't turm my surround sound system any louder.
B001RNI34E|2.0|This is the second of Ms. Hannah's books that I read, although it was written before the one I read first, \\"The Wrong Mother,\\" (also published as \\"Point of Rescue\\").  Skip \\"Little Face\\" and read \\"The Wrong Mother.\\"    Why? Mostly because, thinking back after finishing the novel, the central character (Alice) makes no sense, and the plot is less believable than what I can accept, even trying to suspend disbelief.  These are separate problems -- one concerns the plot and the other concerns Alice's character. I can't say more without spoilers.    In addition, I really do not enjoy sadism scenes, even more so when the victim could fight back and does not.  There are too many of these.    Finally, there is too much time devoted to an not-very-interesting and hard-to-follow interaction between two of the police detectives.    Nevertheless, I kept reading, and will read more, thanks to Ms. Hannah's ability to grab hold of the reader and not let go.  Just skip this and move on to her other works.
1416594787|5.0|This is a very fine book.  I would recommend it to all those not yet convinced by evolutionary thought, to those who, like me, need refreshing from time to time in the basics of this science, and to all who enjoy the English language.  I found chapter 12 -- \\"Arms Races and Evolutionary Theodicy\\" -- one of the best, most succinct answers to the problem of pain and theodicy in general.  Chapter 13 is a Dawkins masterstroke, an homage to Darwin's eloquent conclusion to On the Origin of Species and an eloquent conclusion in its own right.  The photographs are superb.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I paid ten dollars for this and it was worth it! I saw this movie when it came out. It was great and I knew I would buy it on dvd. I was surprised when I saw it on amazon for ten dollars. What a great deal by amazon.

B001GQ2BNQ|3.0|I am learning the Total Immersion method of freestyle. I had to modify the snorkel a bit to work for me. The end was too close to the water.

I get some strange looks at the \\"Y\\" when using it but it works for me!
B001TIQT98|5.0|The lead reviewer's preference for Gary Bertini over Leonard Bernstein is eccentric, to say the least, but I agree on technical grounds that this new issue is the best-sounding version of Bernstein's first Mahler cycle.  A note from the engineer responsible for the remastering informs us that he went back to the original multi-channel master tapes. These were mixed on a \\"state-of-the-art, one--of-a-kind analog soundboard.\\" The resulting mix was then digitally transferred to a single-bit  steam for audiophile-grade quality in the CDs. None of this can be fully translated by me into ordinary ideas, but my ear can tell that some glaring sonic blemishes are gone.<br /><br />I don't hear the brighter highs that the lead reviewer mentions, but the bass is now clean and distinct; there's no digital glare in the higher strings; the orchestra has  more room to breathe.  This is all to the good. Anyone who loves these performances can rest assured that rebuying them one more time is well worth it.<br /><br />I am a devotee of Bernstein's Mahler. Indeed, it's my Mahler, the first I ever heard, along with Bruno Walter's. I bought the original 13-LP box set. As much as I loved the performances, the sound wasn't good. Even now, with advanced technological tweaks, the improved sound isn't as rich, dynamic, or complete as what Bernstein got from DG in the digital era when he returned to Mahler a second time.  Too often the horns are backwardly placed; the string sound is thin at times.  But one thing can be said -- we have come as close as possible, for now, to what the conductor and engineers heard in the control booth during the recording sessions. Good enough, and thanks.<br /><br />Not all of these 12 CDs are well filled, but it's nice that Sony included the original bonus disc in which musicians who played under Mahler remember him. The last CD contains a performance of Das Lied von der Erde that is defective in Rene Kollo's unappealing singing and the lackluster abilities of the Israel Phil., but at least Bernstein himself and Christa Ludwig, in a signature role, are fine.<br /><br />P.S. 2012 - In a recent review that probably won't get enough attention, discophage adds some detailed and intriguing comments about the CD of interviews with musicians who played under Mahler.<br />\\"Unlike what the product info suggest, they were not made in 1967 but in 1960, originally for a radio broadcast that was aired on the LA station Pacifica KPFK on the occasion of the centenary of Mahler's birth, July 7 1960, \\"They Remember Mahler\\".

B00000JXVK|5.0|On Any Sunday<br />by Bruce Brown<br /><br />Every kid needs a hero. Movies and sports work hard to supply.<br /><br />Adults seek people to respect. Talent, humility, and integrity are fine beginnings.<br /><br />Bruce Brown became known for his visually arresting surfing documentary Endless Summer. His camera captured the same sense of danger--and the people who respond to it--in another of film titled On Any Sunday. Much of it was shot at motorcycle competitions that were held over many weekends. It is colorful, and noisy--and quite instructive.<br /><br />Viewers follow American Motorcycle Association Championship contender Mert Lawwill as he drives his van full of Harleys to dirt and road courses across America seeking to again earn the AMA championship laurels. Brown's film makes it plain that this is a lonely journey, filled with long hours, hard work and few luxuries. As we watch, it is impossible not to be impressed with the quiet, determined Lawwill.<br /><br />As it happens, Lawwill also has a famous riding friend and supporter in movie star Steve McQueen. McQueen had established his riding bona fides (on-screen and off) in The Great Escape. Here in On Any Sunday we see him riding in local enduros and desert runs under a false name in order to stay under the radar of other riders and the studio bosses who didn't want their investment damaged.<br /><br />Almost incidentally, we are introduced to a third character who rides with McQueen. At the time, Malcolm Smith was only known to those who followed Trials-type competitions. In Trials, riders compete, one at a time, against the clock over an extremely difficult obstacle course. Only the best ride trials. Successful competitors need patience, judgment, strength, and imagination to win. Malcolm Smith is an International Trails champion.<br /><br />From the moment the slight, bespectacled, quiet Smith rides into the picture, you know that Brown has found a \\"natural\\" and the story moves from Lawwill and McQueen to this extraordinarily gifted rider. Brown is obviously awe-struck too as the tone of his very engaging narration reflects. He has crafted a film that allows us to cheer for three quite different characters, each of whom is striving toward a different goal in this dangerous and very exciting sport.<br /><br />Those of us who watched this film in the theater when it first came out expected to see a movie about a movie star who was one of us and an AMA Champion. Not surprisingly, forty years later, riders remember it as the movie about the extraordinary Malcolm Smith; even today, a hero who does not disappoint.<br /><br />I can't leave this commentary without relating a recent personal experience. I was being interviewed in my cluttered office by a reporter from the Providence Journal. At the conclusion of the formal interview, just as he was leaving the young man inquired about the posters on the walls. I explained to him that I had posters or pictures of the five men whom I most admired. Some he recognized but others he didn't so he asked me to identify all five. I replied, \\"In the realm of the arts, there are William Shakespeare, Leonardo da Vinci, and Giuseppe Verdi. And in the world of motorsports: Juan Manuel Fangio and Malcolm Smith.\\" Sad to say that young interviewer had never heard of Malcolm Smith.<br /><br />But you have, and through the magic of the VCR or CD/DVD player, you can watch On Any Sunday as often as you desire.<br /><br />Copyright 2009, Peter Bourassa, [...]awe-struck too as the tone of his very engaging narration reflects.

Although it's billed as YA, I think adults will find it just as enjoyable. It is an intense read, but, although violent, it's not  overly bloody or gory (IMO). The romance triangle aspect is a little cheesy (again, just IMO), but I'm sure that's something that will appeal to the teenage crowd that this book is mostly geared towards. If not for the romancy stuff, I probably would've rated this a 5/5. All in all, I thought it was a highly entertaining and great read, and I will be reading the sequels.
B001I8BN7C|3.0|This book was in great condition but the smell of smoke was so strong when I opended it that I had to let it air out for awhile before I could stand to read it.
B002KLAL4W|4.0|Really like this one. It is a new direction for them as far as I am concerned. It is fun, it has some straight forward hooks which is a rarity for Pearl Jam. I love listening to it. The bands skills still shine through. It is so obvious how far above most bands they are as far as musical talent and composition. Great rock band... keep on, keepin on fellas. Oh yeah... and I was impressed at the lyrical contributions from the rest of the band.... way to utilize eveyones wrting skills on this one!! I think eddy only wrote 4 of 11.
B000092ZYX|5.0|And now my collection of full Radiohead studio albums that people actually like is complete. Unless they make another one, which they may or may not, depending on which member you listen to. Anyway, as expected, Hail to the Thief is quite good. Just to give you an idea of how much my taste in music has changed in just six years, I remember \\"There There\\" as the first Radiohead song I ever heard, or at least the first I knew was them, and being a bit bored by it. I started listening to the band a couple years later, and now I count that song among possibly their ten best, especially if you count radio playability as a factor. Maybe twenty best if you don't (they have a lot of really good songs).    Thief is an interesting transitional album. Their most recent work at the time was the game changing and unusual Kid A/Amnesiac project, which cemented them as a band that will do their own thing at any cost. Its traditional rock elements were few and far between, and Thief marks them easing into a return to that sound, although with heavy influence of their electronic sojourn still intact. It has the longest running length and most songs of any of their albums. Most have something pretty strong going for them, and unlike the vast majority of releases the record seems a bit back-loaded, with most of the less impressive ones packed toward the beginning.    Just a few tracks that stand out particularly even if it's just for an element that's gripping or interesting instead of a genuinely good song are \\"Backdrifts\\", \\"We Suck Your Blood\\" (best use of hand claps in a song ever?), \\"The Gloaming\\", \\"Myxomatosis\\", and \\"A Wolf at the Door\\". I know I mostly just picked the tracks that would fit in the most on Kid A, but that's not an indictment on what this album does differently - there are a lot of things about it I prefer. And honestly, for me, it might be the band's best release of this decade.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Well, despite my having the entire Beatles collection on CD since 1988, I love this group too much to have not purchased their remastered stereo box set.  I'm very glad I did.  The sound is definitely sharper.  The bass and drums, in particular are more defined;  the 1987 CDs now sound too trebley and tinny by comparison.    Obviously the biggest difference to most of us who owned the original cds is in the first four lps (Please Please Me, With The Beatles, A Hard Day's Night, Beatles For Sale) which were only in mono version, and are presented here in stereo.  Now, this is minor complaint, and the only complaint I have, but I almost prefer the mono version of the first two lps to the stereo versions.  The two channel recording technology of 1963 gave George Martin and The Beatles no better alternative than to record all instruments on one track and vocals on the other, which is probably why stereo was a poor option at this point in history.  The vocals on most tracks on Please Please Me sound a little too echoey in stereo, but was probably the preferred way of recording with mono in mind.  The Beatles themselves also weren't taking the stereo mixdown of their early recordings too seriously, and few people had hi-fi equipment for such a listening experience anyway.  Now, having said that, once it gets to A Hard Day's Night and Beatles For Sale, I think the stereo mix sounds really good, whether the Beatles put much care into the mixdown at the time or not.  So, the recordings of 1963?  Yeah....maybe a little better in mono, but a very minor complaint when taking the overall quality of the new stereo remasters in mind.  Everything from A Hard Day's Night on sounds better, in my opinion.    The extras are a nice touch to the box set.  The booklets with each cd are great, and the dvd with mini-documentaries of each album is surprisingly good, for somebody like me who thought he'd seen just about every piece of Beatle footage.    As a Beatles fanatic, I may consider purchasing the mono box set one of these days, but I just really love the crisper sounds of the new stereo remasters.  Even the overly echoey vocals on some of the Please Please Me and With The Beatles tracks aren't reason enough for me to drop my grade to an A- on the stereo box set.  I give this an A!

B00288KNJU|5.0|Almost everything about this movie is brilliant, from the jaw-droppingly good visuals, brilliantly colored/lit blend of stop motion and computer animation, genuinely funny humor, spooky mysterious storyline that will hold the attention of (brave) kids and adults alike, great mood-setting soundtrack featuring the Hungarian Orchestra, and a French composer and children's choir. There's even a catchy and clever song by \\"They Might Be Giants\\" complete with double entendre \\"She's a peach, she's a doll, she's a pal of mine/She's As Cute As a Button In the Eyes Of/Everyone Who Ever Laid Their Eyes on/Coraline\\" (\\"buttons\\" for the eyes of \\"dolls\\" being a characteristic of the belle dame's fantasy world).<br /><br />The story of Coraline feeling neglected by her parents and enticed by an alternate world where everything seems better (emphasis on the word \\"seems\\") is great, but it may be a little scary for some kids (think \\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\" meets \\"Alice in Wonderland\\"). There's also a hilarious but revealing costume of a bosomy downstairs neighbor during a theater scene in the belle dame's world, which may shock some parents, but I don't think anything else is too objectionable.<br /><br />Beyond that, I should mention that this Blu-ray has THE best quality picture I've ever seen on the format! It's seriously hard to pull your eyes away from.<br /><br />The 3D is nice for one showing, but spoils the color so you'll be watching the 2D version afterwards.<br /><br />Lastly, the digital copy is something I'm a big fan of (so I can take the movie on my iPhone for my kids to watch), and this is pretty near to a must-buy in my view. The movie itself is among my favorites and you almost need to purchase just to show your friends how great Blu-ray can look!
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|The movie \\"The Dark Knight\\" is about a community that is being damaged by the mob and gang members who terrorize the city with actions that scare all the citizens, including a tragic couple mixed up in a situation that may destroy their relationship. The movie takes place in a fictional place called Gothem City. The movie is entertaining and mind blowing for those who would enjoy watching it.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|Wow, comparing the remasterd songs side by side the old 80's mastered stuff is a trip. I love how they took the original 1/4 inch tape and used new and improved tube technology to remaster it rather than that crappy sold state crap they were using in the 80's.  It's the closest thing to vinyl you can get.  Love it. Get it. Love it more
0143116371|4.0|This book is a great adjunct to the author's famous website.  I have dog-eared so many pages (many more than I have in recent editions of Vogue or Harpers Bazaar) that showcase terrific, real-life STYLE.  This book would make a great stocking stuffer for your fashionista friends, or even a nice hostess gift for style-conscious holiday party givers.
B002CAWNEM|3.0|I wasn't expecting much when I got Obsessed, but I always enjoy a good Fatal Attraction-type film. I was willing to give it a try. While Obsessed isn't nearly the thriller of the Glen Close/Michael Douglas movie, it isn't as terrible as it could have been.    The plot is predictable and it is unfortunate that they didn't at least TRY to make it stand out from similar films. There were some excellent opportunities to create \\"I didn't see that coming\\" moments - you know, the kind that make a film stick out, or become a must-buy for your DVD library. This movie was written closely to the formula - sort of like Harlequin novels; no deviation, no surprises. The end scene where the wife is finally facing off with the obsessive freak goes on WAY too long and runs into the ridiculous.    I always love Ali Larter as a psychopath and she really shines in this film - more so than the other actors. Beyonce Knowles was surprisingly good; I was expecting a lot worse.     That said, I still liked Obsessed. There was a certain deviant charm to it that resonated with the thriller genre lover inside. It isn't nearly as bad as other films I've seen this year, including the absolutely horrendous [[ASIN:B002Q4TKBI Sins of The Father]]. I rented it at one of those dollar kiosks and I would urge anyone else who wants to see it to do the same. You will be disappointed if you spend any more than that on it.
1439157383|2.0|I am glad to hear that the movie has the opposite ending as the book.  Admittedly, the book is captivating and brings up some issues worth thinking about.  However, when I got to the end of the book I felt as if the author just gave up and took the easy way out.  I even woke up in the middle of the night after reading the book, furious at the ending.  Of course, in life there are tragic and unexpected events, but I really felt that the ending was a stretch - very unrealistic.  It was kind of like watching a bad soap opera.  The author spent a lot of time describing the feelings of each character leading up to this ending but then wrote an abrupt and catastrophic ending without really allowing time to explore the consequences of it.  So thumbs up for the great writing style and ability to keep the reader interested and thinking.  But overall I was totally in shock and disappointed in the end result of the book.

B0029LHW68|3.0|I bought the MP3 and have listened to the album straight-through four times in the past three days. I'm still not sure how to rate it. It's not like anything I've heard in a long time.<br /><br />First thought, this album solidifies in my mind that Leto et al love concepts. They dwell in concepts and aural imagery.<br /><br />On the one hand, \\"This is War\\" is epic. If you're not expecting it, the open from \\"Escape\\" will send chills down your spine. The prior two albums sounded epic, although differently so. Provehito en Altum (1st album) was epic in that it honestly felt like space rock for starship pilots who enjoyed being on the edge, rather than so much glam-navel-gazing as space rock tends to be. It was lonely, it was out there, and somehow it worked on a distant yet intimate level. Beautiful Lie (2nd album) was epic in terms of heart, not a cheesy romance confined to the limits of a 90-minute teen-happy-touchy-feely movie, rather a profound exploration of pain and resistance.<br /><br />This epic feels like war - emphasized by the choir and military drumbeats. The three tracks after open - \\"Night of the Hunter\\", \\"Kings and Queens\\" and \\"This is War\\" - could very well feature Jared's personal militia accompanying him on his metaphorical emotional journey. Though by the title track, one starts to wonder if all the songs are the same - jubilant if not joyful, but similar in structure beneath the militaristic overtone. There's a relief with \\"100 Suns\\" - though somehow the militia is still  present. \\"Hurricane\\" digs a little deeper, distressing yet just as potent as anything off \\"Beautiful Lie\\".<br /><br />Then we get to the part where I realize they went in a different direction creatively, and it doesn't appeal to me as much personally. I don't think \\"This is War\\" is as innovative as the prior two. Yes, the choir, violins and drums are an innovation - one that Jared & co hold onto and explore exhaustively. And once that theme is exhausted, the band seems to lose focus. They do keep the loud/soft structure, but they express it so similarly in each song - open-mellow-loud-soft-loud-mellow build - loud climax - quiet finish. I hope this is something to continue to explore because they seem to really love it, and maybe I'm just spoiled by the loud/soft that the Smashing Pumpkins were able to pull off on \\"Pisces Iscariot\\" and \\"Gish\\".<br /><br />\\"Closer to the Edge\\" was my least favorite - the melody and rhythm seem inspired by Kelly Clarkson. By \\"Vox Populi\\" the choir is back in full effect - though the impact is lost on me now. \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" makes me think of Orgy or Deadsy, and the opening is just too close to \\"Search and Destroy\\" to be easy to enjoy.<br /><br />So I'll still be listening to \\"This is War\\" - probably for another few weeks before I make up my mind altogether, but I'm giving this one three stars:<br />-1 for overusing the military motif and the homogeneity in loud/soft<br />-1 for losing cohesiont structure, but they express it so similarly in each song - open-mellow-loud-soft-loud-mellow build - loud climax - quiet finish.

B0012QE4Q2|4.0|I absolutely loved this movie, however there were scenes missing.  I first saw this movie on TV.  It was more than 2 hours long.  Then when I purchased the DVD it was a lot shorter.  I was really disappointed.  I don't undersand why there is no option to view or purchase the movie with all the scenes included.  These missing scenes were not part of the bonus features on the DVD either.  But overall I enjoyed the film.

078513915X|4.0|I always like visual renditions of favorite books so when I saw there was a graphic novel of my all time favorite book 'Pride and Prejudice' I bought it immediately. I felt that Nancy Butler did a very good job at taking the essential parts of P&P and putting them in a shorter format for the comic while still keeping the feel of the story as a whole. My only real complaint is the artwork. I've never been a big fan of american comics, I much prefer the Japanese manga, so the artwork for this was kind of creepy to me. Nearly every panel had a close up of the characters' faces that was almost grotesque and when they smiled they made me shiver. I expected them to jump out of the page and eat me. Plus, since this was also a five part series put into one whole book (all five covers are shown in the end as a gallery) the artwork begins to change as you get closer to the end. The dark outline lines become fewer and fewer until there's hardly any outlining at all and the colors begin to soften and smooth into one another. I found the last fifth of the book the best only because the artwork had become so smoothed out that they characters' faces weren't nearly as creepy anymore.<br /><br />So as a whole, this is a great addtition for any P&P fan but don't expect it to be the greatest visual rendition. I hope someone does a (good) manga version someday. Anyone up to the challange?
B002XHN776|4.0|Awesome CD.  Only song I didn't like as much as the rest was Alibi.  Other than that it's a really good album.  The fans chanting in most songs adds to them in my opinion.  Night of the Hunter, Kings & Queens, This is War, Hurricane, Closer to the Edge, and Stranger in a Strange Land are some of my favorite songs on this.  The style here reminds me of Angels and Airwaves in spots but better.
0307269981|2.0|I hope I won't get flamed for this but it sure looks like I'm one of a very small minority of readers who found this sequel to the splendid \\"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" horribly disappointing.  Here's why.<br /><br />You'd imagine that with the unique Lisbeth Salander as returning heroine, Larsson simply can't go wrong but sadly HE DOES. For starters, the plot is so thin the story hardly gets off the ground.  Strangely, he begins with an episode featuring Lisbeth on an extended holiday break after making off with money from the earlier Dragon Tattoo assignment, that turns out to have absolutely nothing to do with the story at hand.<br /><br />Then he spends an inordinate length of time getting down to business - an incredible number of dull colourless characters roll off the pages - it would help readers remember their names or tell them apart if they weren't all law enforcement officers  - and still no real action to speak of.<br /><br />Worse, the storyline is supposed to be set around the illegal sex trade but we don't know anything about it by the time the story finishes.<br /><br />Only when we get to the two third mark does the plot lift off - by then, I had lost interest and couldn't have cared less. The last third is pretty good page turning stuff but it came too late for me.<br /><br />Most ironical is the fact that considering how long Larsson took to get started, he wraps up so abruptly like the editor suddenly realized he's exceeded his word count limit and demanded an instant cut to the proceedings.<br /><br />After this, I can't say I look forward to the final instalment of the Millennium Trilogy.
045122499X|5.0|He's done it again!  Ken Follett has revisited the Kingsbridge Cathedral of his famed novel THE PILLARS OF THE EARTH and given the reader a return journey 200 years later.  We now see Kingsbridge in the late Middle Ages (1327-1361 to be exact).  The city is still filled with all the outlaws, war, death, sex, and politics that drive both novels.<br /><br />In WORLD WITHOUT END, Merthin, a descendant of Jack Builder, builds a remarkable bridge and repairs the weakness in the foundation of the original Cathedral.  We meet Caris, the love of his life whom he seems destined to never have as well as his cold-hearted and diabolical brother Ralph, a hard-working and ambitious peasant named Gwenda and her manipulative brother Philemon, the corrupted Prior Godwyn, and countless others in a page-turner readers will be loathe to put down.  This is juicy historical fiction at its best sweetened with the alleged murder of a King and a secret letter everyone is searching for.  However, the most overwhelming focal point of this novel is the people of Kingsbridge dealing with the Plague, the disaster commonly referred to as Black Death and which killed 25 million of the 75 million people in Europe during the time frame of this novel.<br /><br />This book has all the drama, the good characters, the evil villains, and the despicable doings of its predecessor.  Although it can easily be read without having read TPOTE, reading them in the correct order will only enhance the reading experience of the later novel.

His Scrooge is mean, troubled and seemingly irredeemable but as Mr. Winters makes his way through the story he shows us a quite complex and interesting portrait of the infamous miser. Just so you know there is a female actress to do the female parts and there is music and sound effects throughout the story to make it well paced and impossible to take your ears off of it. Although I don't want to give too much away Mr. Winters gives a Ghost Of Christmas Present with a Scottish accent! This is a wonderful way to help celebrate Christmas!    I never thought I'd find something to rival Patrick Stewart's one man show, but this is a thoroughly entertaining production especially considering the \\"reader\\" is American!
B001ACY8D2|5.0|I was inspired to write this review as a result of a comment written about another amazon reviewer: \\"this guy hates everything.\\"  I am yet to write anything but a one star review, and I thought, will I merely be another snobbish curmudgeon eviscerating every piece of garbage that a world of commodified art tends to produce?  This review is my unequivocal no!  It is much easier to write a bad review, for while so much that is bad is bad in the same way, things that are truly beautiful seem to radiate their own, individual light (yes, I aped Tolstoy there!)  It is difficult to write about something you love, our words can often fail to capture that which stirs in our hearts.  For me, Med sud i eyrum vid spilum endalaust is something like a counterpoint to ( ).  ( ) as an album (also a 5 star work of genius in my opinion) is an epic meditation on pain and loss.  I feel a great deal when I listen to it, but hope or joy are certainly not feelings that readily come to mind.  The feelings are dark, intense, at time transcendental, but even with the punctuated elegance of tracks 3 and 4, I feel like I am in a place that is more akin to purgatory than heaven.  In that sense, after the pain, meditation and depuration of ( ), Med sud i eyrum vid spilum endalaust is in a sense reaching for the sky.      The music of Sigur Ros is constantly defined by a certain grappling with life and death.   I think that the stark reality of death and the anxiety it creates is fundamental to their music.  While (  ) seems to delve deeply into that vast crevasse of metaphysical doubt and ensuing anxiety  that have become omnipresent in this post-modern era, Med sud i eyrum vid spilum endalaust is their redemption song.  (   ) tells us that we are all going to die.  Med sud i eyrum vid spilum endalaust says yes, we will die, but because life is transient we will love, cry and dance!  It is life affirming in the deepest sense, raging against the dying of the light in the only way that will give us peace.    The album begins with Gobbledigoo, an effervescent, frolic into childlike abandon.  You could almost hear the repeated vocal lines at the beginning, chorus and bridge as youthful taunts, but taunts  lacking any malicious intent.  They are simply crying to the shy kid staring at his feet in the corner, just let it all go, come and dance, it's time to play!    Dance is a word that comes to mind on the second track, seeing that Inní mér syngur vitleysingur has even forced a surly misanthrope such as myself to laugh, run and flail my limbs without abandon, whether I'm at home or frightening fellow commuters on the metro as the propulsive rhythm transfigures me into the dance commander!  The bridge which swells with dynamic intensity and polyphonic grandeur is one of the most hope inspiring and blissful musical experiences that one will find anywhere.  It is difficult to listen to this song and without be grateful for every moment we've been given in this life.    I would hate to refer to Gódan daginn as filler, it is calming, otherworldly and a wonderful transition between the two most expressively hopeful tracks on the album.  Vid spilum endalaust gets us back onto the hope train with a similarly pounding piano/bass line which drives us forward but with that familiar and comforting (though somewhat more restrained) sense of joy and purpose.      The next seven tracks represent a slight transition.  The first four are almost like the laughter, joy and celebration of life, love and friends, but festival ironically takes us out onto the verandah, cumulous clouds and a silver moon above, cigarette in hand, reflecting on the night and the mortality that comes creeping back to us when our serotonin levels start coming back down.  But while there is a definite sense of melancholy that can be felt, it never reaches those depths of absolute loss that punctuate (  ).  No, it is the ambivalence of death reminding us why it can be so painful, namely because we loveso much.  This feeling seems to permeate the rest of the album, hushed, delicate, intense love and the knowledge that one day it all ends.  When we listen there is still joy still simmering in our hearts, but it's a joy tempered by time and tide.  Ára bátur becomes the culmination of the ephemeral laugher of youth with the pained reminder of ultimate loss as it gradually builds into a tear wrenching crescendo that is simply sublime.      Here we are in this world, everything is fleeting, we love so deeply as the lines form on our faces and the unbearable lightness of being shines into every corner and crevice of our souls.  And yet, somehow, the breeze rustling the leaves and the pallid light dripping from the sky grab our hearts and we no longer fear the terminus on this strange, beautiful journey.  And as the last track reminds us, in the end, everything and everyone is all right.  And yes my friends, it really is, even when it isn't...
0393312836|5.0|To say that A Clockwork Orange is a \\"controversial\\" piece of media is an understatement: militant feminists and \\"family values\\" activists have gone so far as to remove this book from library shelves. It has been hailed as genius satire and denounced as violent exploitation. Some read it as Burgess's own depraved rape fantasies. Other people will argue that it's an attempt to get into the heads of the young men who gang-raped his pregnant wife. Others read it as a piece of chaotic, post-modern art to be appreciated by the edgy and the hip.    A Clockwork Orange may be all of those things and more. What it is most of all, however, is an amazing, sweeping, page-turning read.   Burgess takes the reader inside the mind of Alex, the leader of a small youth gang, all of whom enjoy nothing more than imbibing mind-altering substances, giving women a bit of the old in and out (whether they like it or not) and beating up the poor. This all changes, however, when Alex is arrested and given the chance to participate in an experiment to cure his sociopathy and turn him into a fine, upstanding member of society.   While Alex's violence and the moral quandary posed by the experiment form part of the sick, prurient excitement of the book, none of it would work nearly as well without Alex's cynical and humorous tongue-in-cheek narration, told in a fictional Slavic-inspired slang language that may be difficult to comprehend the first few pages, but soon becomes readily clear.   With Alex, Burgess takes the anti in anti-hero to new levels, to the point where he can barely be called a hero if not for the fact that his observations and asides are strangely and hilariously charming.

0740785508|5.0|I've seen James Gurney's work for a long time, not only his \\"Dinotopia\\" books, but his illustrations on book covers and in National Geographic. His work should be considered as part of the legacy of imaginative realists such as N.C. Wyeth and Norman Rockwell. And as he says in the book, whatever happens with the economy, historically there has been and will always be work for those artists who can portray realistically what the imagination must supply. Sadly, the school of realism has not fared well in our universities  for many decades (though this is changing I hear). Gurney sure shows and tells about his craft well enough to inspire the new generation of aspiring realists and illustrators.<br /><br />I am not really a [[ASIN:0060530642 Dinotopia]] kind of guy, but Gurney knows how to paint, and all the methods and techniques to produce a painting that seems believable and beautiful at the same time. As an artist myself (though not a realist), I really found a lot of useful information in games to loosen up, making and using maquettes and tableaux, and especially the section on composition (spokewheeling!). It is bound nicely with gorgeous color illustrations of his work (and others) throughout.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this book. Not just a coffee table book of images, and not just a how-to book, it really combines the best of both. Now if I could only half so realistically when I wanted to. I ended up taking a different road in my own art. But hey, maybe I'll give it a try sometime, because Gurney's book is about the best book on painting realistic images using one's imagination I have ever seen. if only I had read this book when I was 16. Thumbs up, James Gurney!
B001FB55MG|5.0|This is one of those movies that we, the parents, don't mind watching over and over, and not being an Adam Sandler fan per se, I can honestly say I think he is quite funny in this one.  We are typically pretty conservative in terms of what we will let our kids watch, but there are only maybe two words that I thought were mildly inappropriate (sexy and stupid were each used once that I recall).  There is one kissing scene, but it is not steamy (the kids still say \\"EWWWW!\\" though!), and for a change, there are no overt or covert political agendas being promoted as in so many other movies these days.<br /><br />My only negative, as in almost every-other Disney movie out there, is that they have to take at least one of the parents out of the picture.  Why is there ALWAYS an absent parent at the crux of these kids' movies!?  I understand that divorce is a huge part of life these days, and thankfully (spoiler alert) these kids get the stable family they need in the end, but, come-on, is it really that hard to write a compelling story around an in-tact family?<br /><br />Enough ranting.  Great original movie for all ages!  (our kids are 5 & 7)
1594201927|5.0|I liked this book because it gave me a good overview of many types of financial markets in a very easy to read, well organized fashion.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|Among the army of Radiohead clones that emerged last decade few bands can today claim to have found his own style. Fewer can boldly stand alongside the Oxford masters (to overcome them is so much to ask for, remember that Thom Yorke and company are cooked separately). One of these bands is Muse that just had delivery \\"The Resistance\\" their fifth studio album. There is not much new to say about Muse music. Everything in their work is excessive and still yet it sounds perfect. Keeping almost the same sound of \\"Black Holes And Revelations\\", the trio deliver intense, ambitious, elaborated and perhaps a little more bombastic, if possible, music. The guys from Teignmouth left behind the \\"floydians\\" album covers but keep their epic style with a progressive rock touch on tracks like \\"The Resistance\\", \\"Unnatural Selection\\" or \\"United States Of Eurasia/Collateral Damage\\" (with an obvious wink to Queen) songs in which they carry their rock/pop to cinematic limits by combining monumental orchestral arrangements with the powerful guitar and passionate interpretations of Matthew Bellamy. The album closes with \\"Exogenesis\\" a 3 movements mini-symphony in which Bellamy gives vent to his classical piano accompanied by Edodea Ensemble. \\"The Resistance\\" is an impeccable album that assures Muse to be on all \\"Best Of The Year\\" lists. It is also a great opportunity to take a rest of the low-fi/do-it-yourself fashion and enjoy a little bit of glamour.    As i wrote at [...]
B00005MP58|3.0|From reading the more recent reviews, I had hoped that the video quality issues reported by other reviewers had been resolved, but I was very disappointed in the video quality of trhe Special Edition DVD. I understand that this was made for television in the days before HD, but if you are used to watching HD, this DVD seems like very poor quality. Like other reviews, I also had to change my TV settings to put color saturation to the maximum, which means that brown and navy become black, but at least you can differentiate pale faces from lace collars. I have a 34 inch wide screen television and this is the first time I have ever been grateful NOT to have a larger screen.     If these issues are resolved with Blu-Ray, maybe it is time to start saving for a Blu-Ray player.
B002H3F7F6|4.0|Hard to fathom the rather \\"cool\\" way in which this disc has been received by so many listeners.  Given all the \\"schlock\\" that gets turned out at Christmas, this is a work that stands in pretty sharp contrast.  While I am occasionally less than fully satisfied with the \\"fit\\" of Sting's voice to some of this material (hence 4 stars rather than 5), If On  A Winter's Night represents--in every other respect--a marvellous seasonal work, beautifully capturing the gentle essence of the Christmas/winter solstice season.  More accessible than Sting's album of music by John Dowland (though drawing upon a similar aesthetic), featuring wonderfully nuanced and varied arrangements, those who are looking for something a wee bit different for the Christmas season (something that more than bears repeat listens), If On A Winter's Night comes highly recommended.
0071636080|5.0|I had a big presentation ready to go, and after reading this book, I hit the Delete button.  After using the tips in this book to re-create a very important presentation, it quickly became \\"the presentation\\" everyone was talking about.  One VP said \\"It was the best presentation I have ever seen in my entire life.\\"  Coming from a person who sees over 1,000 presentations a year, this was a huge compliment.    The book is simple to read.  Gives real-world examples using Steve Jobs real keynotes.  I went back and watched some of his keynotes, and the author was dead-on with his analysis.    I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their presentations and get away from the boring old \\"bullet points\\" of what we have to endure every day.
B002OFWG7O|3.0|Really an album with all Foo Fighters hits (with exception of Wheels, which I don't think is one of their best). But DVD is only a collection of their videos, which is rather disappointing. But could you expect more for 10$..?  With all the recent hype it's a good time for such collection and I would definitely recommend it to those who want to have complete coverage of their music. Just do not put many expectations in to \\"Deluxe\\" stuff, because it's nothing impressive :)
B001EGFQNU|5.0|When OMD first hit, I was in my late-30's! Unfortunately, OMD did not realise much success in the USA, first charting with So In Love in 1985.  I enjoyed their follow up singles.  But when their Greatest Hits LP (on A&M) was released I really got excited by their earlier work, especially Messages & Maid Of Orleans.  Then later it was one of the first LPs I replaced with a CD.  A&M did a great job on the CD and I've played it many, many times.    Then when I got high-speed internet, I watched their videos on [...].    Then I happened to find this CD/DVD set: Messages - Greatest Hits.  After reading the other reviews I thought that the reason to buy this set was for the DVD and that the CD was ok.      I love watching the videos and seeing them on wide screen tv is definately better than [...]!  Plus I enjoyed watching the ones I hadn't seen.  I would rate the DVD 5 stars.    Then I listened to the CD, and wished that I hadn't waited so long to buy it!  The remastering job is fantastic.  Messages sounds incredible and really takes off.  Maid Of Orleans gave me chills, and the harmony on Forever Live & Die was georgeous.      Plus there were several songs that were not included on the A&M release.  The best ones are Sailing On The Seven Seas and Telegraph.  But on the downside, We Love You and La Femme Accident were left off.  I would rate the CD 5 stars.    That gives this set a total of 10 stars.    I discovered Gemm.com and they sell 45's from all over the world.  So I've been buying the early OMD singles, as well as ones by Sweet & Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich - two other UK groups that didn't have much success here.  Naturally all three of them are among my favorite groups of all-time.
0307454541|3.0|Mikael Blomkvist rails against \\"speculators\\" and \\"bean counters\\" but has been unfaithful to his wife.  The hypocrisy of moral outrage is a staple for good reason.  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is not such a book.  Instead, Mr. Larsson presents his journalist as admirable.  After all, Mikael has voted in a parliamentary election only once, and then for the Social Democrats, and he'd been honest with his wife about his feelings for Erika Berger. His wife had assumed the liaisons would end when they married.<br /><br /> Mikael believes that \\"the sharks\\" create interest rate crises, that these creatures speculate away the savings of (sensibly diversified?) small investors, and that slum landlords \\"force\\" young people to pay \\"too much\\" for appallingly dismal apartments.  Mikael fails to take advantage of this last opportunity by building attractive and affordable housing.  But then, the job of the financial journalist is \\"to scrutinize corporate boards with merciless zeal.\\"<br /><br /> If any of this sounds ridiculous to you, skip this book.
B000ZECQ08|4.0|An upsetting trend has begun to develop with recently released DVDs, being that they don't have any special features unless you buy the Blu-Ray version. But Happily, this 2disc edition has a good selection of special features and thankfully they've dropped the annoying voice over that was on DVD's of the older Harry Potter movies. My only complaint would be that there is no commentary! Other than that, I'm satisfied with this DVD.
B001RV53SA|5.0|\\"Traffic\\" is as timely now as when it was released in 2000. The American belief in the efficacy of the \\"War on Drugs\\" is put to the test in this movie. Michael Douglas plays the newly appointed drug czar, and he learns firsthand from his own daughter what a fruitless and pitiful effort is this thing we call the \\"War on Drugs.\\" As long as there is an insatiable demand for drugs in the United States, there will never be anything called a victory. The efforts put into the supply side are shown to be farcical. On the supply side corruption and crime are endemic.<br />The war is really a series of skirmishes. Failures in the \\"drug war\\" cause many deaths and misery.<br /> The movie is told in a series of stories with each of the storylines having a set of characters that at times intersect and form the bigger picture. Two detectives on the American side (Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman) in San Diego are tracking a drug ring while two detectives on the Mexican side in Tijuana are going after a major cartel. One of the Mexican cops, Javier, is played brilliantly by Benicio Del Toro.<br /> The American drug boss and his wife form one of the story strands. In an effort to save her husband she becomes as ruthless and cold-blooded as he.<br /> What \\"Traffic\\" illustrates is that it's the actions and honesty of ordinary cops who win small victories in the \\"war against drugs\\" that count, not the futile efforts of misdirected national movements.<br /> The movie is long, but fascinating and worth sticking with. Some scenes are filmed in sepia tones. It's an intense and very significant and pertinent film.
0307408833|5.0|I'm sure I'll write a longer review as I looooove this cookbook and am so thankful for it. However, most of the people's comments that have a negative point, say they were disappointed the book said \\"Gluten Free\\" and that was not the case. Lighten up and read the cover it clearly says \\"(Mostly) Gluten Free\\", so ease up with the critique of something not being exactly the way you wanted it, when it never promised to be. How about try to concoct the recipe's with the spelt flour with flour alternatives until you get the blend that makes you happy? As for pricing, they didn't create the pricing in the grocery world, and we should be thankful someone spent so much time concerned about making scrumptious cruelty-free, healthier, and mostly gluten-free treats and decided to share their secrets with us.
031606792X|2.0|WARNING! Contains some spoilers.    Now, let me start by saying, I have never been a romance fan. I only learned of the existence of the Twilight Saga when the release of the first movie was announced. I read online spoilers to give myself a better idea of what I would be in for if I actually gave in to pop-culture and read the book. Those were enough to convince me to give it the good ol' college \\"try\\".    I will say that it was rewarding to read Twilight, followed by New Moon and Eclipse. I found myself an immediate member of Team Jacob (though I had a feeling I knew how things would play out) and continued to read mainly to find out how that character's story would resolve.    My praise for this saga is in that it encouraged my -- at the time fourteen-year-old -- sister to read. She had always been difficult when it came to picking up a book, so I give my gratitude to Smeyer for accomplishing what other authors had failed to do. For that, kudos.    Now, here comes the negative.    The first three of this saga were, in my opinion, phenomenal. Perhaps the writing left something to be desired -- and yes, I found myself thoroughly disgusted with the Edward and Bella characters after the events of New Moon -- but the story in general was oddly compelling, and I found myself eagerly anticipating the arrival of my copy of Breaking Dawn when I ordered it less than a week after reading Twilight.    Imagine my dissapointment when I found out that, not only does Jacob's story have a rather unsatisfying -- and frankly disturbing -- ending, but not even the main character's experiences could salvage this travesty of a novel.    700 or so pages of drivel concerning the sparkly vampires (which, btw, is a sin for which I will never forgive Smeyer), Bella's near-instant coping with the wild newborn tendencies everyone was convinced she would have to endure, as well as the sudden violation of so many previously established rules (Human-vampire hyrbid? Really? And here I thought Twilight's vampires had no bodily fluids except venom . . .)    Then, there's the antagonists. The Volturi are arguably the most powerful force in Smeyer's vampire world. So how, how I ask you, is that they are thwarted by the machinations of a know-it-all hack like Edward, and newborn, self-indulgent, suddenly oober-powerful Bella? And what about an epic showdown? I'm sorry if it's unreasonable, given all the hype for nearly ten chapters about the preparations for this inevitable confrontation (which even has Alice allegedly running for the hills, and she's braver than the rest of the vamps put together) to expect an actual battle once the major players have assembled. If nothing else, couldn't we have at least had the satisfaction of knowing that petulant little Jane got her comeuppance? While you're at it, why not reduce Aro to a smoldering pile of ashes? Caius, too.    And don't get me started on the anticlimactic love scenes on the island. I'm no fan of smut, and I don't expect everyone else to agree with me, but even I would've preferred a little more to go on a quick journey into deeper water! Where was the pillow-talk? The cuddling? Edward doesn't sleep, so it's not like he's tired after doing the deed! Honestly . . .    In short, this book disappointed me. I can appreciate Smeyer's wanting to end her saga on a positive note, and maybe even avoiding serious bloodshed. I respect that much. But to build to such a climactic moment, only to have them RUN AWAY is insulting to your fans, and will likely guarantee that this book never sees the big screen (or I fervently hope not!)    But heck, don't take my review for it. Read it for yourself . . . just don't say you weren't warned.
B00005NWM3|5.0|\\"Silver Side Up\\" is an impressive rock album full of powerful, heavyish but very catchy rock songs. Melody and power are not always something that are captured together on rock albums but Nickelback have managed it on this to great effect. You are launched into this wonderful world with the gorgeous opening track \\"Never Again\\" and the album just does not let up, delivering one storming song after another. The combination of pace, power and enjoyment in a studio album is rare - extremely impressive!!
B0029O08WA|1.0|As I am a very open minded person and am not one to judge in immature ways I feel that this soundtrack was lacking.  Although there are a few songs that are good, the majority aren't right for the movie and just aren't songs that you want to listen to over and over again.  I felt it almost painful to listen to these songs. They are slow, annoying and don't get to the point.  Even though these songs are in my favorite genre's it just wasn't what I expected.  Sure it's great to buy for the poster inside but other than that I wasn't pleased with the songs on this soundtrack whatsoever.  I understand that it was all meant to fit the tone of depression for the movie but none of these songs screamed Twilight Saga to me.  Loved the Twilight Soundtrack, Was not fond of this one.
B00000272N|5.0|The often overlooked \\"Facelift\\" marks the starting point from which Alice in Chains staked a claim in the Seattle scene. Tracks like \\"We die young\\" and \\"Man in the box\\" instantly grab the attention, whilst other tracks such as \\"Love, Hate, Love\\" approach from a slower, more subtle angle but still leave the listener in awe of the haunting but powerful vocals of Layne Staley. Definately a more instantly accessable album than their second album \\"Dirt\\", \\"Facelift\\"'s slam-bang rock style smacks of late eighties rock, but without the cheesey cliches and an added edginess with a raw sound. Classic stuff from an awesome band, and that's without even going into the classic \\"Dirt\\" album !!!
B00005R8FI|5.0|Perhaps not Mayall's best performance,but if you enjoy British blues of the late sixties and early seventies, this piece of work is a must have.
B00008ADPF|5.0|This is a great follow on from the 2001 hit album 'Silver Side Up', which this album develops on and makes a better sound, better melodies and better lyrics; which give the album the push to make it one of the great albums of the 00's. The tunes are heart-stopping, which 'Figured You Out' having a great guitar intro, and the melodic follow on 'Should've Listened' makes the album much better than their first effort, 'Silver Side Up', which fit the time well. The fast paced album opener 'Flat On the Floor' is an eye opener, with a constant drum bashing and guitar mashing being the centerpiece of the whole song. The vocals are riveting, with great lyrics to go with Chad Kroeger's mind-blowing singing voice; which is very distinct. 'Someday', 'Believe It Or Not', 'Because Of You' and 'Another Hole In The Head' keep the album interesting with guitar pounding anthems, drum fills and great vocals by Chad Kroeger. They all have their strong points but not many weak points that people can pick at and criticise this great album. The extra bonus tracks are killer. Great cover of 'Saturday Night's...' which is nearly as good as the original. 'Learn The Hard Way' is a great song which has distinctly editted vocals which gives the song a different direction to move in, which is good. 'Yanking Out My Heart' also has a distinct repetitive gutiar rhythm which is the only song on the album, that lets it down.
B000002GB9|3.0|You know, i've heard some Styx hits, and heard other recommendations from my peers, but when i bought the whole CD, it didn't really stand out to me. The problem with styx is, althought their technical musical ability is great, they lack that really \\"explosive\\", dripping emotion/passion and depth behind it; their songs are decent on their own but as an album, lack diversity, and the poetry is pretty straight-forward... it's like, ok, Styx, you're tired of the media and people putting up facades and all that jazz, ok great, but, sort of like a 'tell me something i don't know' in the pool of Prog rock. its a fine CD to jam to once in a while, but nothing that really stands out.... Instead, listen to something like Jethro Tull's MINSTREL IN THE GALLERY or Kansas' POINT OF KNOW RETURN if you want something a little more poetic and heart-felt.  The album cover art is pretty frikkin awesome though, its worth that if nothing else.
B000001FTD|5.0|Among the living contains alot of sharp, forceful riffs from guitarist Scoot Ian and, true to the thrash metal stlye, very fast tempos. There are also lots of killer tempo changes and guitar solos to make the songs even more interesting.   Anthrax also ensured that their music was still fairly original. Joey Belladonna actually sings well on this album whereas so many thrash metal singers just shout. His voice helped Antrax create an original sound. The album also has a hardcore punk influence, noticably in the shout-along choruses, which helps mark it out from many other thrash records. It is also refreshing that the band weren't taking things too seriously here. While it is a heavy album with all those crunching riffs and the typical thrash metal speed, the album never sounds particularly dark and is never falls short of just being extremely enjoyable. The lyrics also help give the band a fairly original sound. A skeleton in the closet (one of my faves) and the title track are both based on Stephen King books, I am the law is a tribute to Judge Dredd and Efilnikufesin (N.F.L) is about the comedian John Belushi and his death. There are also some more political lyrics in One world and Indians, while Imitation of Life is an attack on all the glam metal bands of the 80's.(nothing wrong with glam matal though,some people don't like, i happen to like it. really like all types of music)  So there you have it, a classic thrash record. It really packs a punch with its ferocious brand of thrash metal, that has Antrax's original style written all over it. It is the most consistent thing they ever realeased too. My favourite songs are I am the law, A skeleton in the closet, Indians and the mosh pit classic Caught in a mosh. The album never gets repetitive and each song has a slightly different feel or structure to it. You really ought to buy this album.
0307346617|5.0|Best zombie novel I have ever read. Max Brooks proves he is a really good author and that he really knows the stuff he writes about. Book is written as a series of interviews with people who were in a big world war with zombies. Interviews are with people from all over the world and they describe how the war started and all the way through almost losing at and then how they saved themselves and after that the Earth. Brooks really knows his history and present, knows a lot about world politics and has some pretty good predictions as to how would each nation react (war is happening in the near future).    He really studied what would happen if people were to loose Earth to zombies and how would they have to change everything about themselves to conquer it back. He knows a lot about the stuff that surrounds us and how all that would go to hell and what would we need to become a civilization again.    Zombie lovers must read this book.
B00005QENZ|5.0|The album marked the end of the band's Geffen years, and what a high-note to bow out on...  Unashamed MTV-friendly rock pervades the CD, but it is delivered with such panache as to be more than forgivable. Some fans hated the fact Aerosmith were seemingly in ballad mode as 'Cryin', 'Crazy', and 'Amazing' dominated the air waves for what seemed like an eternity (but hey, it afforded us the opportunity to see Alicia Silverstone on three separate occasions...never a bad thing). To be fair the three tunes are essentially the same, and it was a bit self-indulgent of the record company to release them all as singles after the initial success of 'Cryin'.But Get A Grip has a lot more to offer in the form of tunes like 'Eat The Rich', 'Shut Up And Dance', and crowning glory 'Livin' On The Edge'. A definite party album in terms of its sheer energy and up-beatness.    If you consider yourself a fan of rock music, you cannot be without this album!
B002RSDW80|3.0|\\"Julie & Julia\\" (2009) is half of a great film, with the magnificent Meryl Streep adding culinary icon Julia Child to her gallery of classic performances. The scenes between Streep and Stanley Tucci (as Julia's supportive diplomat husband) are nothing short of sublime. However, melding Child's \\"My Life in France\\" with Julie Powell's 2005 memoir proves problematic. Despite writer-director Nora Ephron's best intentions, the parallel stories never dovetail into a satisfying finale. The likable Amy Adams offers a strangely unlikable portrayal of the blogger cook - a directorial misstep on Ephron's part. Chris Messina, by contrast, is thoroughly appealing as Julie's devoted spouse. In retrospect, a Julia Child biopic would have been far more effective. Perhaps Streep can take a crack at The French Chef's later years.
B000086EOB|5.0|The second album from the legendary W.A.S.P represents a more mature and sophistication since the debut one.  The amazing voice of Blackie Lawless is stronger and better than the previous album. The lyrics are more profound and well composed. Wild Child is a great anthem very strong with a lot of rebel attitude very characteristic of Blackie himself.  Congratulations to Snapper Records for the remastering and inclusion of B-sides tracks of these 80's hard n'heavy classics.
0545123267|5.0|This is the most wonderful book I have ever read. It is about Grace, an 18 year old who has always loved the wolves that live in the woods behind her house. one wolf in particular, Sam, a beautiful wolf with gold eyes, stands out to her. A very suprising romance occurs!! Maggie S. pulls off romance perfectly and I could not put this book down until I finished. I love that it is about werewolves, but they are sweet and gentle and beautiful and the story was awesome! A must read :D
B000Q66HBE|5.0|Okay, so if you like catchy sing along choruses, some huge simplistic metal riffs and the odd bit of shouting then this band are for you. The Poison is a great album with a variation of songs, from the more emotional songs such as 'All These Things I Hate Revolve Around Me' to the fist pumping 'Room 409'. This is really an excellent album, which is a good base for those who are beginning to get into the heavier metal bands. With a couple of songs thrown from their superb EP this album is topped off with the majestic 'The End' which really hits home what these Welsh metallers are about.
B0002KQNJU|5.0|I saw this movie many moons ago at the Fox Senator Theatre in CA & I thought it was incredibly funny & way before it's time. Beautifully photographed, & endearingly portrayed by all the principle performers, this movies is & always will have a special place in my heart & DVD library. I have never shared this before with anybody until now, but here goes, I saw this movie (alone)at the Fox on the afternoon of August 8, 1969, & the following day I witnessed the news reports & read about what had occurred the previous night before in Los Angeles. I was shelled shocked to say the least. Beautiful actress Sharon Tate, the female lead in this movie & the pregnant wife of director Roman Polanski & four other house guest were horribly murdered at their home in Bel-Air by the Manson morons. I have since then always had this strange connection to this movie ever since. It's not very often that you can successfully combine the genre's of horror & comedy, but when you do & it works, well then what you have is very funny little gem of an overlooked vampire movie. Never did Sharon Tate look so beautiful, then in this film.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|I won't bore you with the story behind this album - just to say it is different to their previous albums although their style can still be recognised. A lot more experimentation, love for Queen, Pink Floyd and The Beatles evident.<br /><br />01) The End - A powerful introduction (8/10)<br /><br />02) Dead! -  up-beat song, about death! (9/10)<br /><br />03) This Is How I Disappear - Very good song(9/10)<br /><br />04) The Sharpest Lives - I  think this song reminds me of, another fast and good song! (7/10)<br /><br />05) Welcome To The Black Parade - Brilliant rock ballad(10/10)<br /><br />06) I Don't Love You - A  song that shows that they are able to change, but still retain their own sound (8/10)<br /><br />07) House Of Wolves - Classic ! (10/10)<br /><br />08) Cancer - A moving, slow song (10/10)<br /><br />09) Mama - I don't like this song as much, I think it stops the flow of the album (4/10)<br /><br />10) Sleep - Slow and strong, another ballad  (9/10)<br /><br />11) Teenagers - This song is great, has a very sing-a-long sound to it! (8/10)<br /><br />12) Disenchanted - I love this song(10/10)<br /><br />13) Famous Last Words - A great end to the album, so feel good! (10/10)
0385504225|2.0|It had me going until about the middle, then suddenly the whole thing just falls apart and in the end you are left wondering why did he even write the book. The ending is so dumb, all these people are killed and for what - a mytar and a bible.  Please, National Treasure was better.  If your thinking of reading it - don't.
B00005QEO1|5.0|A tight album of ten songs which deliver a consistent and enjoyable Aerosmith listening experience. Openers 'Young Lust' and 'F.I.N.E.' start things off at break-neck speed, before the immortal words 'Goin' Down' are uttered and anthem 'Love In An Elevator' kicks in. Only by track five does the pace lessen slightly with fan's favourite 'Janie's Got A Gun'.For me the two most enjoyable tracks on the album are 'Don't Get Mad, Get Even' and 'Voodoo Medicine Man' where Steve Tyler gets his hoodoo on. Closer 'What It Takes' and 'My Girl' are the only songs which could be accused of being weak, but the album itself has more than stood the test of time.
0780626966|5.0|This is such a great show and I'm so glad they had it in a collection I had to buy Freddy vs Jason separate from this though.
0060594896|5.0|I knew about Jack Canfield from the Chicken Soup series. Now there've been so many of them, I've lost track. Jack Canfield is nothing if not prolific. At times, I felt a little overwhelmewd by the sheer mass of the advice contained in the book, but I simply chose the principles I found most attractive and that has worked well for me.<br />It's simple, straightforward reading with captivating anecdotes, heart-touching tales and practical easy to try steps for achieveing success. The instructions are clear, only problem is potential inner resistance.<br />The book helped me visualise my way into a whole new continent within a month of reading it. Talk about dramatic life change. Jack's newsletter and coaching/ mentoring also helped me a lot. He had offered a free 30-day program along with the book when I bought it, plus a free manual for starting your own Canfield Study group.<br />Not everything in the Principles appealed to me and I have had experiences that seem to contradict some of what he says, but that in no way detracts from the validity of his message. In fact it just proves 64 are not exhaustive. I bet Jack will be coming out with more soon. He's well worth reading. I also checked out some of the references he gave in the Success Principles (Napoleon Hill, etc.) which was fantastic reading, too.<br />Best of all: it works!

B002VH7P4O|5.0|I bought one of these Beatles USB Apples today and all I can say is OMG!    I've been buying LP records since 1966, then audiophile half-speed master pressings in the late 70's/early 80's, (and every other type of audiophile vinyl) and then CDs in the early/mid 80's. I've always been on a quest for \\"the perfect version\\" (sound quality wise) of whatever I was into at the time. I know that vinyl LPs are having a bit of a renaissance at the monent, and nobody loved records more than I, but let's face it...unless you have major bucks to sink into a super high-end system, they don't sound all that great with a cheap phono cartridge on a (GASP!) belt-drive USB turntable. And even if you buy a gazillion dollar cartridge, and a multi-gazillion dollar phono pre-amp, you're still going to hear only half of the channel separation (or less) than you get from a CD. (Take THAT, vinyl heads!) Throw in all the surface noise, the pops, clicks and ticks, worn out grooves, and you're right back in 1968, listening to the \\"White\\" album or \\"Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn and Jones Ltd\\" on a GE Wildcat Stereo in your bedroom.    All analog curmudgeons and their dinosaur opinions aside, (non-compressed) digital audio saved us from (adding any more) tape hiss or surface noise. Even vinyl fanboys have to admit that. I was one and I did. (I do miss the 12\\" x 12\\" artwork though!)    Ok...so I waited since 1987 for the Beatles CDs to be done right. Sure, \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"With The Beatles\\" were recorded, meant, and intended to be heard in mono (by George Martin, anyway). But back in 1987 we were truly robbed when \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" and \\"Beatles For Sale\\" were only released in mono, when perfectly good stereo mixes existed (those albums were originally recorded in the studio on multi-track machines and mixed for both.) I remember the 60's...when you went into the record store and they had TWO racks of your favorite newest release...one rack was MONO and the other STEREO and GOD HELP YOU ifyou ever got the wrong one. You'd end up sterile. Or bald. Or insane. Your cattle and your crops would dry up. Your children would have eleven toes and three eyes and would turn out to be ax-murderers. The moon would leave its orbit. Jack, you simply tore a hole in the space/time continuum if you ever played a stereo album on a mono record player.    Back to 2009...for all the uninformed people who say the Beatles are \\"double dipping\\" by releasing these remasters, take this >>> many bands have already done 3 or 4 versions of their CDs (Doors, Fleetwood Mac, Rolling Stones and millions more) and they re-release newer, louder versions that don't sound any better every few years. The Beatles waited 22 (count 'em...TWENTY-TWO!) YEARS to re-do theirs. So shut up and go play GNR or Miley Cyrus or some screech n' growl death metal on your Nano.    Anyway...    I LOVE the new, 2009 stereo remasters of the Beatles catalog. They truly ARE better than sliced bread, Chia pets and the Clapper. The sound is AMAZING. Or so I thought until today.    I put this USB stick into my computer, put my AKG 240 headphones on and started listening to the 24-bit Flac file version of Abbey Road. I can die right now. After hearing these better-than-CD-quality files, (ABSOLUTELY, COMPLETELY, POSITIVELY TRULY BETTER!) I have found the Holy Grail as far as sound quality and the Beatles music are concerned. I got a deal on this at a local record shop ($208!) but it is easily worth 3 or 4 times that. Not because it's a little green aluminum apple, or it's a limited edition, but for the SOUND QUALITY, matey. The sound is even more detailed than the new remaster CDs. It's more spacious, open and clean. I can't fully describe it, really. The songs have depth and presence. You can close your eyes and it's like your listening in the control booth as the Beatles are there live, recording these songs. They're crystal-clear...it sounds like \\"music in 3D.\\"    I have the MFSL Beatles half-speed mastered LP set, and the original 1987 CDs, and they truly sound like AM radio in comparison to this. It really is THAT incredible. Oh sure, some will moan that it could have been better with higher than a 44.1 sampling rate, or they should have been saved in 24 bit wav or 24 bit aiff files, but they'd never be happy with anything, would they?    For the here and now, there is NO BETTER version of the Beatles' material. And we might be waiting ANOTHER 22 years for them to top this USB Apple.    In addition to the Flac files, it comes with the whole shebang on MP3's encoded at 320 kbits. They sound great too, but you can rip 320 kbit MP3's from the CDs and get the same, I believe. There is no DRM (Digital Rights Management) on these files, they're yours to put on as many computers as you want. For those moaning about being able to play Flac files, download Goldwave and re-save them as 24 bit wavs or 24 bit aiff files and give your iPod a real treat instead of that low-quality MP3 crap you're downloading.    Beatles forever!

0385532458|4.0|John Grisham heads back to his literary roots of Ford County.  For those of you who don't recall (or didn't read the dust jacket), Ford County is the setting for his first (and possibly best) book \\"A Time to Kill.\\"<br /><br />After a disappointing legal thriller for his last new book, it's nice to see Grisham get back to the business of storytelling again with this collection of short stories.<br /><br />Grisham pushes his boundaries as a writer, offering up stories that offer humor, pathos and character building.  The requisite lawyer gone wrong story is in the book, but Grisham makes the caper-nature of what the guy is doing compelling and interesting enough and the story doesn't overstay its welcome.<br /><br />The best stories are those that bookend the collection.  The first about three guys heading to Memphis to donate blood to a local but who end up getting side tracked by a run in with the law, beer and then a Memphis strip club is wonderfully done and, at times, hysterical funny.  The final story about a man with AIDs returning to town for his final days will put a lump in your throat and stay with you long past the final page being turned.<br /><br />If you've given up on Grisham, you might want to come back for this one.

B002HWRZH0|5.0|As a big Star Trek fan I've been witing for this release since the moment I walked out of the cinema. When I sam this exclusive edition on Amazon, I decided to buy it, because my husband collects model Star Trek ships. This is an excellent addition to our collection, a detailed and high quality metal ship.  As for the Blu-ray itself: I love this movie. I think it's fast, action packed, funny, has unexpected emotional impact, and offers a mnew view at a (we thought) very familiar universe.  The extra's are pretty extensive, with the whole process of writing, casting, shooting described in all kinds of featurettes. I'm not a big fan of extra's that just have stills, but the interactive models of the ships are pretty cool.    All in all: I'm a very satisfied Trekkie!

0156421178|5.0|George Orwell went to Barcelona in 1936 as a journalist to cover the Civil War; instead, the idea of making a stand against fascism caught him up and so he enlisted in the militia.  For the next year, he served two tours at the front and witnessed the street fighting amongst the Government forces in Barcelona.  Then, facing jail because the militia he joined was outlawed by the ascendant Stalinists for failing to adhere to the party line, he escaped into France and finally home to England, all while still suffering from the throat wound that had knocked him out of the fighting.  'Homage to Catalonia' is the result of his observations, written after his participation, but before the war's conclusion, when Franco's defeat still seemed possible.       Much of the book describes his time spent on the front lines, along with another portion that untangles - or attempts to - the various goals of the forces fighting for the Spanish Government.  Aside from these comments, though, there is another, partially voiced complaint that must have preoccupied him for years after, as he revisited it in his later works - the use of propaganda in the war.  Throughout the second half of the book, it's clear that Orwell was becoming frustrated with the way the world's press had spun events of which he himself had first-hand knowledge, yet it was also evident that, as a weary participant, he felt a bit resigned to it.  Still, he couldn't keep the irritation out of his recollections when he discovered that for some of the accounts, not only did the papers warp the truth into its complete opposite, but they also did not attempt to reconcile its fiction with reality.  They simply printed what they wanted their worldwide audience to read.  Today, I think, we would look at many of the publications Orwell refers to and intuitively understand that they were communist publications, and with the experience of the Cold War behind us, assume that those papers would automatically spin the truth.  I doubt Orwell had many illusions about them either, but I do think the effectiveness of these blatant fictions surprised him some.  That effectiveness was only possible because of the distances involved and the concerted effort to push a certain storyline, but it made me think of our own media, inescapably subjective regardless of intent.  Like Orwell, I too have little doubt that some items are pushed in certain directions - might I also be surprised at how far and how effectively?    Orwell came to Spain already opposed to fascism - leftist newsprint in England had convinced him that the conflict was a cut and dried affair of human decency against oppression.  My own unexamined opinions about this particular event in history were much the same.  Orwell dismantles the idea of the Spanish Civil War as an emblem of the morally pure facing off against evil, and makes it clear that despite whatever idealistic impulses many of the volunteers against Franco may have had, larger forces subverted much of that energy to their own ends.  Orwell's account, in conjunction with some other recent readings, forces me to reconsider events I may have looked at as axiomatic blueprints for 'just' causes.  The fact that one side was not motiveless does not negate the injustices perpetrated by the other, but it does strip away some of my own illusions (fostered by a popular historical subjectivity).  It also serves as a warning to those who, perhaps longing to get behind such a clear-cut moral stand, will allow others to sway them to a course of action that is actually doubtful and unclear.      Orwell himself is no objective observer - something he admits several times while urging the reader to understand that his description of events can only be a reflection of the small corner of the conflict that he witnessed.  Even so, I believe it is a genuine and earnest account, with only the desire to clarify the situation in relation to his experiences.  In that context, 'Homage to Catalonia'is an account of the particulars, rooted in the events it covers.  And yet, without browbeating the reader, and almost as an aside, other themes inherent in Orwell's homage seem as germane to my world as it was to his.  That a description written seventy-five years ago still carries an edge that fine is just good history to me.

Perfect pacing, great action scenes, amazing special effects and best pf all, great writing and top notching acting by the entire cast.

0307269760|5.0|The characters in Alice Munro's newest book, some anyway, are more extreme than I've been used to encountering in her earlier books. There are two triple-murderers, a woman whose childhood friend helped her kill another girl, a beloved son who chooses to be a derelict, the male narrator (rare for Alice) whose port-wine birthmark thwarts his whole life, and there are a statistiacally improbable number of \\"specials\\", people with disabilities of intelligence. The dysfunctional relationships, Munro's perennial subject, are more extreme, or perhaps just more quirky, than in previous portrayals. Munro's stories have always stayed close to home - southern Ontario - and close to plain folk, to herself, her family, her ordinary `others'. That's been the great strength of her work, really -- her honesty, her close-to-bone reality. Now in her seventies, in this book and in her 2006 \\"The View from Castle Rock\\", Munro seems to be stretching her range both in time and space, writing about emigrants of the previous generation, about people who weren't and couldn't have been neighbors ... and in the title story of this collection, \\"Too Much Happiness\\", she's written a long story/novella about a Russian woman mathematical prodigy of the 19th Century. It's easy to understand why she wants to stretch, to establish her claim to some universality and some ability to get beyond her own identity as a subject. No one who has read all of her previous work, as I have, could deny that she has \\"written the same story again and again.\\" She has. Or rather, she has written her several stories again and again, like Leitmotives, in her eleven books. That is NOT, believe me, a weakness in her art. It's been her genius to be able to re-examine those stories - those experiences - from the perspectives of different ages-stages of her `unfinished' life. Each retelling has expanded the story, added rings to the tree trunk of memory.<br /><br />Trees, wood, and wood-working... it occurs to me that `wood' has been as much a character in Munro's narrative cast as any human, and in this collection, one story is titled \\"Wood.\\" `Cancer' has also intervened often enough, and in some of Munro's finest stories, to be considered a stock character. If anyone supposes that Munro hasn't written enough about the Great Themes, let me ask you: what theme is greater than one's own death?<br /><br />Or than `age'? Munro has always written eloquently about the elderly, and about children. That's been another of her literary accomplishments. In this collection, however, `age' takes a different role. Here's the first sentence of the story Some Women: \\"I am amazed sometimes to think how old I am.\\" Wow! Me too, Alice! I'm ten years behind you, 68 to your 78, but I'm keeping pace like a kid brother, edging relatively closer every year. Munro writes about the strangeness of living memories of dead-and-vanished worlds, of life-styles that now seem incomprehensibly extinct, of conversations recorded in her living conscious mind that seem archaic and exotic now. Age - being old in the always-new of life - is the unifying theme of Too Much Happiness.<br /><br />Thematic unity is what makes Munro's eleven books of stories more than mere `collections'. Each of her books has been a story-suite, a genre of fiction distinct from the novel or novella, in which the various narratives entangle and infuse each other with meanings. That's the case with the first nine stories in Too Much Happiness. Frankly, I didn't begin to sense the impact of the first story, Dimensions, until I'd read the fourth or fifth. The final story, of the historical `feminist' martyr Sophia Kovalevsky, stands somewhat apart from the others. Perhaps it might have been better reserved for a different collection or published separately.<br /><br />Munro is more tolerant of the failings of her women than of her men. More forgiving, though it's not that there's less to forgive. Many of her women, especially her first-person female narrators, are what my mother would have called \\"pills\\". My mother never used the B-word. But Munro's men `are who they are' - completely recognizable and plausible, from the outside - while Munro's women are ... herself. There's more of her strength: her honesty of perspective and her ability to forgive herself, after cross-examination, at least enough to be able to write her confessions. Munro is above all a confessional writer, of the generation of confessor-poets like Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop.<br /><br />And perhaps I need to confess that I don't consider Too Much Happiness one of Munro's best books. No single story in it is as powerful as \\"The Bear Came Over the Mountain\\" from her 2001 collection Hateship/Friendship/Courtship/Loveship/Marriage, or the title story from Something I've Been Meaning to Tell You, or \\"What Do You Want to Know For?\\" from The View from Castle Rock. Those three stories are sublime. For them alone, Munro should rank as the \\"greatest writer who hasn't yet won the Nobel Prize.\\" But Too Much Happiness is a powerful book, worthy of its lineage as Munro's twelfth suite of stories. I can't wait for her thirteenth!ld have called \\"pills\\". My mother never used the B-word.

1416955070|5.0|I feel that the author did an excellent job developing the different characters and sub-plots within the book.  The fantasy of  having \\"shadowhunters\\" who are essentially human's trained to kill demons who inhabit the world was easy to believe.  I liked the   fantasy world of the vampires, fairies, and werewolves, and how the various characters interact with them.  I loved the love story  between Jace and Clary, and thought that Jace's character was developed the best out of all of the characters in the book.  Magnus Bane as  a warlock, is funny and witty, and was also well developed.  I liked the struggle between good and evil, and I loved the conflicts  between Jace and Clary's relationship.      It is a believable fantasy world.  I read all 3 books in 4 days, and they sort of remind me of the Twilight series.  I actually like  Jace better than Edward, in that he is a human and is part angel.  What could be better?  I loved these books and would highly recommend them.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|I read this book in anticipation of seeing the movie.  I had already heard from friends and some reviews on Amazon that the ending was awful, so I was prepared.  Well, there was no need.  I liked the book from beginning to end.  The premise of the book is great and controversial.  I loved that the book was told from different character's points of views and jumped forward and backwards between chapters.  I didn't find it difficult to follow along at all.      Now I hear that the movie has a different ending and I'm excited to see what happens there.  I'm so glad I read the book first and I plan to read other Jodi Picoult books in the future.

0810970686|1.0|I would rate this a minus one star, but there is no way to do that here.<br /><br />Our book club decided to read this book.  OK,I am over 60 and I have never liked \\"humor\\" in which people are embarrassed or have bad things happen to them.  So, to me it wasn't at all funny.<br /><br />There are sooooo many really great books written for the 5th grade crowd, I'm sorry to think that this is what passes for good these days.  Take the Hatchet series for example, or Animorphs.  They have plenty of adventure and are not hard to read.<br /><br />Does no one think that the antihero of the series might be an example to other kids - do they really see his blunders as something to learn from or do they identify with him?  Reviews by kids suggest the latter.<br /><br />It also bugs me that the grammar is poor, the \\"me and Rowley went to the movies\\" contruction is used throughout.  I certainly think that while this might make the book more believable, it is repeated over and over as if this were correct English.  Kids will copy this.<br /><br />I don't mind being called a fuddy-duddy, the book I read, I consider trash.
B00008J2PG|4.0|I enjoyed this movie based on the real life exploits of Catholic priest Hugh O'Flaherty (Gregory Peck) who risked his life to save the lives of thousands of others, including numerous POWs from the hands of the Germans.  Based out of the Vatican which maintains a delicate position of immunity/neutrality, O'Flaherty uses an extensive network of contacts to aid him in his work.  The acting by Peck and  Christopher Plummer as SS Col. Herbert Kapler, is first rate and the script is quite good for the most part.      There is a brief synopsis at the end of the movie of what became of Col. Kapler.  It is disappointing however that with such great factual material to work with, a documentary was not included as a special feature on the life of Monsignor O'Flaherty.  My other complaint is the lack of English subtitles for those of us who are hard of hearing.
B001TODCII|3.0|One recent moment of great humor for me was watching 72-year-old Charles Bronson destroy bad guys and outrun automatic weapon fire during the fifth installment of his ever popular \\"Death Wish\\" series. That movie, made in 1994, was the end of the line for fans of that particular series. While Charles Bronson apparently wasn't available to play the lead here, \\"Taken\\" seems to have, ahem, taken up the mantle from \\"Death Wish 5\\" with ridiculous levels of action and heroism.<br /><br />If you've been living in a cave somewhere, the plot of \\"Taken\\" is Liam Neeson's 17-year-old daughter goes to France with her teenage friend -- over dad's objections -- and is almost immediately kidnapped. This happens while she's on the phone with dad, a former security expert, who ends up talking to her kidnapper and vowing revenge.<br /><br />Having apparently no financial worries, Neeson flies to Paris, almost immediately finds out who did the kidnapping, finds the guy and chases him to his death on a freeway ramp. This begins a lengthy discourse in ultra-violence and bloodletting rare even for this genre of film. You probably can figure out for yourself without seeing the movie the sequence of events and ending, so I won't bother with them. Suffice it to say the body count is high and the action plentiful.<br /><br />I found myself both involved in this movie and laughing through much of it. There is no indication the filmmakers were trying to create a parody and the leading man certainly does nothing to generate laughs. He is completely serious throughout in the same way the steely-eyed and thoughtless James Bond of Daniel Craig contrasts to the cool, tongue in cheek and sophisticated superagent portrayl of Sean Connery.<br /><br />If you like action, revenge and/or violence, you should watch this film at your earliest opportunity. It's pretty good as these films go with fine production qualities. Neeson's characterization, while not credible because of a flawed script and lack of vision, is compelling nonetheless. You'll probably root for him whether you like the movie or not.You'll probably root for him whether you like the movie or not.

B000002AGM|5.0|Miles Davis added another glorious jewel to his impressive catalogue of succesful recordings. This suite -which dates from 1957- illustrates once more, the egregious and unequalled sound of his instrument with such grandness and innovative originality that one must recognize we are in front of one his most unerring musical achievements.<br /><br />Don't miss this milestone recording: an acoustic gem.

0226264211|5.0|This is a book that should be in the library of all freedom-loving individuals. It is old school, basic, foundation-building information.<br /><br />Friedman is not an anarchist and this book is not anti-government. It is championing the accomplishments of Western Civilization, the free-market, and most importantly the individual.<br /><br />It does start off a little slow and tedious, but chapters 7-13 are worth any possible moments of boredom. Originally published in 1962, it reads as if it were written today. Mankind has not changed and we seem to keep reliving the same worn out arguments. Friedman offers many well-thought answers and insights.

B00001ZWTT|4.0|If you don't care about realism, don't care about historical accuracy, weren't a fan of the original show, and are obsessed with steam-powered gadgets and machinery that couldn't possibly work in the real world, this movie is awesome. I can understand why most people don't like it, but for me this movie is just fun to watch. I guess it appeals to my inner steampunk:-P
B0012GMUZY|5.0|What an amazing story. In 1928, OKeh recording director Tommy Rockwell discovers a then 35-year-old John Hurt in Avalon, Mississippi. Hurt goes to New York in February and cuts a handful of tracks. \\"Frankie\\" and \\"Nobody's Dirty Business\\" sell well enough to bring Hurt back in December for two more recording dates. These thirteen tracks are the result of those 1928 sessions. Hurt would spend the next thirty-five years in relative obscurity before his next recordings at the age of 70. But even if he never stepped into a recording studio again, these recordings would still make Hurt one of the most revered folk-blues artists.<br /><br />I first encountered Hurt's music by way of Doc Watson, but there's no substitute for the real thing. There's no flash, no guitar pyrotechnics. Just a simple man whose restrained vocals and unique fingerpicking create nothing short of magic.  ESSENTIAL  [Running Time - 38:17]
B001KVZ6G6|4.0|I enjoy watching a movie where I have no idea what to expect.  All too often these days, Hollywood shows so much in the previews that you know the entire plot before watching the movie.  This was not the case for me with UP.  I just heard it was a good movie from friends and the only preview I saw was of the old man floating his house away.  Thanks Disney.    With that said, it didn't take long into it to realize approximately what was going to happen.    They treated his life and wife's passing VERY well.    I'm pleased to have watched it.
B002NXSRVG|4.0|All I heard was don't waste your money going to see this movie... now I wished I had. The movie is not a documentary of war but a re-do of a cartoon. (one that I watched as a kid) This was an exiting movie, had action and even a love interest. What more do you want? No this isn't a serious movie... but it is not supposed to be.
B001AVCFK6|2.0|Attention Universe: This is the layman (normal,regular guy-expects what he paid for ).<br />As a long time STAR TREK fan I thought this movie would ENTERTAIN its paying audience.<br />Having purchased the BLU-RAY disc and viewing it on my BD player, a great disappointment unveiled. ALL logic has been pushed to the wayside. It was like watching a two hour SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE spoof. Once the cobweb / crustacean-like Romulan Spaceship exited the (wormhole?), things just went south. No need to elaborate(see review by GURMAN SINGH BAL), too bad I can't get my money back.<br /> As for Blu-y Quality, it gets 2 stars. If you really want a Blu-ray reference, see the BD versions 'ZULU' (Michael Caine) and \\"HOW THE WEST WAS WON\\" (ensemble cast). I gave the BD Transfers on these two movies 5 stars and so did all the other reviewers. I got what I PAID FOR!
1400082773|4.0|\\"Barack Obama is the most powerful writer since Julius Caesar.\\" When the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) made this claim in October 2009, we were suspect. But after reading Barack Obama's first book, we were not.     \\"Dreams from my Father\\" is a powerful book. That it comes from an American president, even more so.     This does not mean we don't have criticisms of the book. We do. But first, what we liked.    The first part of the book - \\"Origins\\" - should be required reading. Period. Beautifully written and insightfully observed, it's a universally human story about identity - Obama's own and others'.     An incredibly rich passage of \\"Origins\\" - and reflective of the book's seasoned soul - comes near the beginning. Obama is describing his maternal grandfather, a white WWII veteran from Kansas who decided to move the family out west to Hawaii:    \\"He would always be like that, my grandfather, always searching for that new start, always running away from the familiar. By the time the family arrived in Hawaii, his character would have been fully formed, I think - the generosity and eagerness to please, the awkward mix of sophistication and provincialism, the rawness of emotion that could make him at once tactless and easily bruised. His was an American character, one typical of men of his generation, men who embraced the notion of freedom and individualism and the open road without always knowing its price, and whose enthusiasms could as easily lead to the cowardice of McCarthyism as to the heroics of World War II. Men who were both dangerous and promising precisely because of their fundamental innocence; men prone, in the end, to disappointment.\\"     The passage has a human frailty and honesty about it, a certain poetry. That it comes from a politician is both surprising and refreshing. Obama credits his grandfather's spirit, as described in the passage, for the family's move to Hawaii, a move leading his mom to his dad and ultimately leadingto Obama's torn existence and storied journey to the White House.    The next (and last) two parts of the book - \\"Chicago\\" and \\"Kenya\\" - are not as impressive. Obama's writing becomes tired - what once was profound now feels flowery. (Perhaps it's all profound but that too much depth fatigues.) The story also strikes us as less engaging - what once was timeless insight is now more descriptive of events. At this point in the book, it's who Obama is that keeps our attention, not the book itself. If you're not an Obama fan, or don't care to be, you don't have to read these sections. But if you're interested in knowing how Obama developed his political chops (\\"Chicago\\") and how he uncovered pieces of his identity in Africa (\\"Kenya\\"), then do.    Acute observers of Obama have noticed a man torn between lofty ideals and grounded realism, between the glory of greatness and the humility of service. This book is a subtle reflection of that - perhaps an internal tug-of-war between his instinct for full transparency and his ambitions for political office. You get the sense he wants to share an unfiltered version of his story, but also that he's holding back in some respects - not in the beginning so much as once he reaches \\"Chicago.\\" There's a level of personal depth that he simply loses as he takes us beyond his college years. He begins more to report than to reflect. Perhaps that's what dries out the book - this shift from insightful reflection with universal implication to deflective reporting with mildly interesting vignettes.     Are we being too harsh on the last two parts of the book? Maybe, but only because the first part is so darn good. Whatever the reason, there's no denying that President Obama is one heck of a writer, arguably the most powerful - in political and literary terms - since Julius Caesar.
B001GCUO4S|3.0|Being a huge fan of FD2, it was hard to top that movie. Kinda the same as Terminator 2 overshadowing the expectations of the following movies. FD3 was ok, but was no where near as good as parts 1 or 2, and I did not expect this 4th installment to be as good as either of those, so I was not that disappointed when this 4th one finished and I thought, \\"I knew it\\"    The plot of this one is much the same as the others, the group of people in this one survive being victims of a Nascar crash that caused havoc in the stands of spectators. Then one by one, death catches up with them. However, the plot and finding outs in this one did not hold up as well as the first 2, or even the 3rd one for that matter. The storyline of this one goes very quickly. It doesn't seem to play on that cool idea that \\"what you think is about to happen, happens, but after they do something not expected just before it\\" this one is pretty much, you think you know whats about to happen, and it pretty much just does.    There is a couple of cool death scenes in this one that should make fans of the film say \\"HA, COOL!!!\\" but then again there is also a few that really looked dodgy and too CGI. But mind you, the reason the film may have been done this fast paced way and CGI kills ect.. is because it was meant to be seen in 3D. So I will have to return to this review and edit it the day I see it in 3D, so my review so far is only for the regular 2D version.
B002SSBD6W|5.0|This book reads extremely well, but is not always a fun read. Foer's research on the abuse and cruelty in the factory farm is eye-opening, shocking, and highly disturbing. It is also critical that his message reaches the popular masses. How much longer can we, as a society, continue abusing animals? Moreover, how much longer until we change the inefficient and wasteful factory farm? We cannot deny this massive elephant in the room any longer. I hope other readers see it with the glaring spotlight Foer shines on it and we can create change.
159562015X|4.0|The book itself is nothing special: the first 30 pages make the point that we often focus more on improving our weaknesses than capitalizing on our strengths, while it is through using our strengths that we find fulfillment. The rest of the book is devoted to descriptions of each of the 34 \\"themes\\" of personality (e.g. Achiever, Analytical, Consistency, Learner). The real reason for this book is found on the last page: an access code that lets you take their online strengths test, giving you your top five themes.    Having never taken a test like this before, I can't compare it to any others. I have reservations about some of the dualities they seem to espouse (Do I look toward the past or the future?). I also wonder how they came up with 34 themes. Why not 35? Or 10?     But I did get enough out of the test to recommend it. I wasn't surprised by any of the results, but it did tell me some things I had never articulated. Even better, the test results included an \\"application\\" section which suggested actionable goals based on the traits it identified, and some of those suggestions were very insightful. For example, while it might sound like management-speak, their suggestion that I should partner with an Activator (someone eager to  get a project started) is borne out by my collection of abandoned projects.    Personal inventory exercises feel to me a lot like sitting down with a psychic: you ignore the stuff they get wrong and focus on the stuff that at some level you already know. But as a way to guide your own introspection and articulate some characteristics you have only vaguely recognized, this test is worth the money.
0786868724|5.0|I have never read the author until now.  As I wondered through the bookstore I was literally drawn to the book.  A still small voice.  My current personal circumstances are difficult but not insurmountable by God with just a little faith.  I was overwhelmed in parts of the book as his Rabbi spoke directly to me through Mitch.  A divine orchestration.  God speaks when we are ready to listen.  Mitch; thank you for listening.  You are making a difference.  It does not matter your religious vantage point; this book will touch your heart, as it should.
B001AVCFJM|4.0|Although Chris Pine did an excellent job with the making of Star Trek, he deviated from the classic storyline of the three main characters.  Especially he changed the history of James T. Kirk's history and thus I have to berate him a little for that.  As far as Star Trek is concerned, I am a purist and the story should have stayed the course.  Of course I am one of the original trekkers from way back in the old times of the 1960's.  Except for this one major flaw, I have given this movie four stars for special effects; writing; acting; and I basically enjoyed the movie.

630282091X|5.0|Owl Moon, the classic Caldecott winner, has long been my favorite children's book.  The story and the illustrations -- all pure magic in book form -- are dramatically accentuated in this Children's Circle video, more than worth the price just for Owl Moon alone.  Author Jane Yolen's voice, sound effects, music, brilliant camera effects (pans, tilts, zooms, etc.)  applied to the inspired art of John Schoenherr without in any way altering it.  All this is storytelling at it most brilliant.

B0015UKX7E|3.0|First off, I am a huge Prince fan.  \    This was a great performance, but the camera work was horrendous. If Prince is taking a solo... how about show him playing the solo... not 6 different camera shots of the band/audience/etc... It was starting to give me a seizure/making me nauseous.     Take a lesson from Stop Making Sense.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I'm not going to try to write a classy review on this. All I want to say is that if you are a fan of most of the musicians/artists who performed at this concert then I would heavily suggest getting it because you will most likely find it worth watching parts of it over and over! Everything about it was high quality from the performances to things like the lighting, etc... I was very impressed by everything on this DVD. My previous two roommates and I watched parts of this DVD so many times we lost count-and we still have never got tired of it! And personally I felt that a lot of it is not just entertaining but very moving!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Planet Earth is an amazing ten part documentary about the wondrous pristine natural world, some of which focus on creatures and places that had never been captured on camera before. I loved all ten parts, each on a distict type of environment of the planet. Surprisingly my favorite of them was the one on deserts (not an area I had been particularly interested in in the past), with its jumping lizards and head-butting antelopes and the swarm of locusts which looks likes a massive ring of smoke from afar but comes off terrifying clos up. Some of my favorites items from other parts include the amazing slow motion shots of Great White Sharks hunting seals on the part on shallow seas, and the rare Snow Leopard chasing its prey down steep dangerous rocky slopes on the Mountains episode. There's too much great, fascinating and exciting stuff for me to describe, and since I purchased the set I've watched each part at least twice. Also on the DVD version are three additional documentaries on the future of this planet, and they in my opinion aren't near as fascinating as the main stuff but are still well worth watching.     I bought the DVD version, and while it doesn't take full effect of the special HD cameras used, it looks as detailed and crisp as any DVD I have ever seen. The sound on my 5.1 system also sounded superb. Bottom line is I can't imagine anyone of any age or personality, male or female, not enjoying Plant Earth. And now at the lower price it's a no-brainer.
B0019LY5IM|4.0|I am going to make this short and sweet.  I thought that the DVDs for the Fifth season were put together very well(i.e. the episodes and all the bonus features).  I only had maybe a couple of issues with it.  First, why is it that they have stopped putting the liners notes with the indepth episode synopsis.  With the fourth season and now the fifth season they just provide a list of the season's episodes.  Second, there seems to be a couple of bonus features missing.  In the product description here on Amazon.com, it says that among the bonus features is \\"A day with Josh Holloway\\" and a behind the scenes of the 100th episode celebration.  I looked everywhere in the DVD's bonus features and I couldn't find either of these.  Am I the only one?
0688145078|5.0|I purchased \\"I'm a Big Brother\\" for my 3 year old grandson who just became a big brother in August, 2009.    I had it sent to my house because I watch him and his little brother 2 days a week.  I wanted him to feel important now that the baby arrived.  I told him I had ordered this book specifically for him.  He wanted me to read it too him immediately.  I did so.  He loved the story and pointed out pictures in the book that he, himself, had already done.  Holding the baby on his lap, helping feed the baby his bottle and running to get Mommy a diaper so she could change the baby.    He was very excited about seeing things he had done printed in the book.  For about 3 weeks after he first saw the book, he wanted me to read it to him everytime he came over to our house.  It made him feel very important; which was the main goal.    I think any new 'big brother' would enjoy this book and I highly recommend it.    Sincerely,    Esther Ann

B002N2XFXC|3.0|Ambos libros son muy interesantes and fueron escritos con mucha imagination y talento. Sin embargo, tengo mis reserves y dudas:    1. ambos cuentos tienen demasiados cosas en comun - el sitio dondo se protagoniza el relato,(la playa de Normandi),el personaje del principe de la niebla es el mismo que la Sombra, el bosque y el jardin, las criaturas mecanicas y las estatuas, el relojero, el reloj que giraba al reves, el faro, etc.    2. la Guerra mundial que ocurria en la misma epoca que las historias de los libros, esta mentionada por el escritor mui de lejos, com si no fuese un factor letal que influyo en las vidas de milliones de gente y como tal Guerra no demonstrase quanto lejos la maldad humana pudo llegar.    3. el final de ambos libros es algo decepcionante - despues de tantas aventuras y tormentas, me esperaba un final mas sorprendente - y no lo fue.
0887307280|3.0|Pros: Some excellent points, especially re the need for systems/standardization, documentation, training and metrics.  Cons: 1) Assumptions that a) the only valid reason for starting a small business is to create a \\"franchise\\" that you can eventually sell and b) the only way to grow a business is through outside financing.  2) The book felt like a self-promotion piece selling the e-myth process and consulting services. 3) No index.

B000LXH0AE|4.0|Harold, played with great restraint by Will Ferrell, is one of those obsessive-compulsive types who live lonely boring lives of desperation. He brushes his teeth using the exact same number of strokes each day, knots his tie the same way and catches the same bus on the way to his boring job at the IRS.<br /><br />One day, Harold hears a voice in his head -- a woman's voice with an English accent, Emma Thompson's voice in fact -- narrating his life as it happens. \\"Little did he know,\\" the voice intones, \\"that Harold's actions have put him on a course to his own death.\\"<br /><br />The acting in this movie is uniformly good with Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah and Maggie Gyllenhaal all contributing. Ferrell is better here than I've ever seen him; he makes us see the true goodness of his character buried deeply beneath the facade and his yearning to live. The premise is interesting and the movie asks some important questions: what is more important, life or literature? How do you live a life to make it worth living? We learn that Thompson is a famous author wrestling with writer's block and a life almost as empty as Harold's. But this movie never gets freighted down with philosophy as it barrels along to its satisfying conclusion.<br />Well worth an evening in front of the boob tube....
B0009XNUK0|5.0|There is no doubt that he was truly the King of Pop. This is a great affordable CD set of his music. I usually buy my music by song on iTunes or Amazon's MP3 site, but with so many great songs, buying the entire album as a CD and then importing it from my Mac to my iPods was the most affordable and highest quality option.<br /><br />It may not have every song that he sung, but it does have most of his best and for the price, it cannot be beat.
0143036556|5.0|This book summarizes the effects of 5 factors causing or contributing to the collapse of more than 7 societies in the past, the success of some and the potentials for future collapses including that of the US.  It lists some reasons for optimism, and reasons for pessimism.  The five factors analyzed are over use of resources causing environmental damage, climate change exacerbating environmental damage, hostile neighbors, cultural values and attitudes that limited adaption to changing circumstances, and population growth. The descriptions of the societies and their histories are very interesting, the analysis is objective, supported by evidence and for the most part supported by science, archeology and history. As a practicing forester and ecologist for more than 40 years, I consider this book is a must for anyone, liberal or conservative, who is concerned about the future they are bequeathing to their children and grand children.

B002OHB2TK|5.0|\\"Samantha Fox\\" was originally released in 1987 and was the follow-up to her first album \\"Touch Me\\". The album produced 5 hit singles, \\"Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now\\", \\"I Surrender\\", \\"I Promise You\\", \\"True Devotion\\" and \\"Naughty Girls\\".     The original vinyl LP contained 10 songs with \\"Satisfaction\\" strangely kicking things off but the CD version of the album, in some countries, moved this track to its position here, after \\"True Devotion\\", and started with the more original \\"I Surrender\\" in its single form.    \\"True Devotion\\" was remixed for its single release and a new song, \\"Even In The Darkest Hours\\", was recorded as its b-side. Both of these tracks appear on this release as bonuses.    Fan-favourite \\"That Sensation\\" is a great album track that probably should have been released as a single after \\"I Surrender\\" instead of \\"I Promise You\\".    This re-release of \\"Samantha Fox\\" also contains the single mix of Full Force's \\"All I Wanna Do . . .\\". The track is misplaced on this CD though (as it dates from a later time period) and the 12\\" version of \\"I Promise You\\" should have been included instead.    Definitely her best album from the 80s, \\"Samantha Fox\\" has dated the least and has the artist singing solid material that has her sounding at her very best. A must have in the CD collection!
B001EO2UJK|5.0|Excellent sound. A must for every Genesis fan. The music in 5.1 channels gives you an experience never found before. Best albums with Peter Gabriel as never heard before.

B002KQ6BT6|4.0|A fine addition to the Dan Brown series. I finished this book in a cold winter weekend when staying inside was the best option.  Much easier to visualize if you have been to Washington DC. Overall, a good fiction read.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Buble is a great artists.  He manages yet again to take standards that have been sung by many and turn them into his own.  He has a great voice and great attitude when he sings.  I enjoyed the arrangements of this album.
B0011V9XT6|3.0|I thought the concert was ok...she copied a lot of other artists on several acts..makes me wonder he original she is. The quality of the blu-ray and the sound is great though. I gave it 3 stars because of her performance and her lack of originality. But if you are a Beyonce fan, it's a great BLU-RAY...i happen to like most concert on blu-ray!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I didn't get a chance to see this in the theatre, and I rarely purchase movies have not not seen, but on the recommendation of my mother, I did buy this set.  And I am so glad I did.  The movie is heartwarming & sweet, yet very funny & has action!  My boys that are 6, 5 & 2 just love it!  And I loved the story too!  I'm super picky on what my kids watch & what movies I buy for them to see over & over again (like kids like to do), and this one is not crude, or mean, or scary, or inappropriate in any way.  There is no cursing, no questionable language or content.  It deals with love, loss, friendship & mentor ship.  Plus it's nice to have the blu-ray to play at home & the dvd copy to keep in the vehicle for road trips.  It's a movie I can stand to either watch or listen to over & over again!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Testing with PS3, 40\\" Samsung LCD, and 2 speakers stereo.   Good pictures, good sounds.  Recommend for Blu Ray testing, and collections.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I grew up watching the classic Start Trek episodes & while not a out & out \\"Trekie\\", I do have love for the series & the characters.  And this Star Trek movie really touched on all the things I love about the tv episodes!  If you don't know the show that well, then there are many things about the movie, characters & lines that you won't \\"get\\" as they reference so many aspects of the tv show.  That doesn't mean that you won't like the movie though!  It has lots of great action, amazing scenes, great dialog, and character development.  And it's a movie that I like to watch over & over again.
B000UR9T7I|5.0|Bought it for my 1st blu ray, watched that movie few times, that blu ray has good picture and good sounds. Very satisfied. Recommend for Blu Ray test or collection.
0061438294|4.0|Enjoyed it for the most part.  Got some good information and found the examples in the boxes interesting and helpful. I thought the preaching about tolerance of other cultures was unnecessary.  I was loooking for facts about universal expressions and body language that are present in all cultures.
0307269981|4.0|I didn't realize the trilogy would split the last two books across one story - the first book (Draggon Tattoo)introduced the key characters but was a stand alone story. The second (Fire)contained interwoven but threads of different stories, so while the key theme of the book is absorbing, it contains so many different developed characters/sub stories, I came to relaize there must be a 'continuation' (Hornets). Thats OK but Fire is 700 pages of albeit paperback so you put a lot into reading the book and come up slightly empty -I suppose thats the magic/skill of Larsson, he leaves you longing to read the next installment which it seems (from Hornet reviews) is a continuation to Fire.I am a great fan of Dennis Lehane and put Larsson in the same league - his early demise at such a young age is truely tragic. Enjoy this book but know that is setting the scene for Hornet's.
0385504225|4.0|This book I thought was an excellent follow up to the Da Vinci Code. I was on the edge of my seat the entire book. Dan Brown's use of historical buildings and objects to create fictional stories is one of the most creative writing styles I have ever come across.
B000ETQR3Q|3.0|It's very big for little kids (under 7).  The single shooter that can be removed has very little range (5-10 feet). The darts jam often if the kids don't cock it fully from front to back and front again.  The clip system is great. It is interchangeable with all of the clip system N-Strike guns even with the drum from the Raider CS-35 and vice-versa. Just make sure to not over load the clip and to have straight darts or the darts will get damaged and not shoot straight.  My kids also have the Firefly REV-8, Maverick, Rapid Fire CS-20, and the Bubblebee brand Buzz Bee Automatic Tommy 20 Blaster, Belt Blaster, and the Twin Tek 6 Blaster Set.  Straight out of the box the easiest for my kids, nieces and nephews to use would be the pistols (Nerf Maverick and Buzz Bee Tek Blasters). Happy Nerfing.

B002H3F7F6|3.0|3.5 stars.  Sting has always been our moodiest and most intellectual of pop stars, with the darkness of his lyrics often at odds with his bouncy melodies and that distinctive light and raspy tenor.  This latest project is firmly in the Sting aesthetic, so his hardcore fans are unlikely to be disappointed with this offering.  I think, however, that this is not the album to win one over to the Sting camp if one is not already in it.    As Sting himself has copiously pointed out, this was not intended to be a holly jolly romp down Christmas lane; the oft-forced and tinny joviality rife in other commercial songs of the season is something which Sting (and this reviewer) find repugnant during what is a sad, lonely and isolated time for many.  If you are of the same mind, you will find many of Sting's minor-key, introspective musings here a refreshing antidote to too many sugarplum warblings on offer in December.  Of the 15 songs here, I would call half stellar; a few (mostly the original Sting compositions) are OK but are derivitive of stuff we've heard before, and a couple are just flat-out bizarre.  \\"The Hurdy-Gurdy Man\\"'s haunting, classically-inspired tune belies the grim story of a poor street musician who freezes to death and then is eaten by dogs.  Sting's own \\"The Hounds of Winter\\" (previously on his \\"Mercury Falling\\" CD) gets a new treatment here and it does contain seasonally-approciate lyrics, but this recycled number takes up a spot that could have been occupied by a fresher and better song. A Sting rendition of \\"In the Bleak Midwinter\\" (something that would be perfect for his voice), for example, is notable in its absence.  Or how about \\"Good King Wenceslas\\" or a cover of Joni Mitchell's \\"River\\" or Loreena McKennitt's \\"Snow\\", none of which are particularly Christmas-y?  Sting makes use of some Bach melodies as background for his own lyrics; lovely to listen to but ultimately forgettable, with nothing particularly wintery to recommend them for this collection.  As some other reviewers have pointed out, Sting does some odd vocal stylings with some of the more medieval-sounding numbers, producing a forced and ponderous tone that is out of his natural range.  It's as though he believed he could become a basso profundo by sheer act of will, but his voice is not up to the task, and he only succeeds in quashing what is unique and attractive about his sound.    As one would expect from Sting, this is a musical journey that is both personal and experimental; some parts of the experiment succeed better than others.  In crafting a partially lovely, partially unsettling aural experience, he has remained true to his own unique vision, and in the end, this makes him an artist with integrity.  The fact that he's also wildly commercially successful is just icing on the cake.  Sting has reached the point in his life and career where he can make music solely to please himself, and if it finds an audience, too, well, that is just a nice bonus.  If you own all of Sting's other albums, it would be an oversight to skip this one.  If Christmas music is solely what you are after, you might consider just purchasing individual songs--\\"Gabriel's Message\\", \\"Soul Cake\\", \\"Lo, how a Rose ere Blooming\\" and \\"There is No Rose of such Virtue\\" are true Christmas songs, and my favorites.

0375704027|4.0|Haruki Murakami's NORWEGIAN WOOD is the story of the coming of age of Toru Watanabe, a Tokyo student who grapples with a consuming love over 1968 to 1970. Toru is captivated by Naoko, the girlfriend of his deceased best friend, and remains dedicated to her even as she descends into mental illness. This all happens against the backdrop of late 1960s political radicalism, free love and classic rock and jazz.<br /><br />Murakami's novels usually have fantastical elements, but this is \\"just\\" a love story. Nonetheless, perennial elements of his style remain, such as a male protagonist negotiating a labyrinth of female characters, who have intriguing connections between them though they don't know each other, and a plot point or two that seems important but are never resolved. Haruki is a good novelist, though perhaps his range is too narrow for him to be a great one. Nonetheless, I truly enjoyed NORWEGIAN WOOD. It makes some powerful observations of that difficult transition from late adolescent to full adulthood, and its description of the impact of 1960s counterculture (my favourite era of history) is somewhat enlightening.

0061914177|5.0|During my last job interview the question came up how I would use social media as a marketing channel. I had to admit that for me it is not clear how to use twitter, facebook et al. for a drug, esp. with the restrictions on DTC advertisements outside the US.  For myself I felt that I might get a bit old and lose touch with this development. This is why I decided to buy Gary's book.     The book gives a very good introduction to the usage of the different platforms, what they have to offer and how to link them. Besides that it was an entertaining read and if you watch some of Gary's videos you can feel his enthusiasm for the whole topic. A very funny and motivating guy with lots of experience to offer.    Although Gary makes it sound easy and fun, he also makes it clear that you have to be committed to a lot of work, need an open mind and have a genuine passion for your topic. So for a company this might be a very big decission to make. On a personal level it shouldn't be that hard.  Once you are willing to share your passion and maybe leverage it and yourself to a new level, this book can show you the way to succeed and motivate you along the way.

0451196716|5.0|I'm going to keep this short and sweet. First, this book is amazing. A friend asked me the other day if I'd read it. When I said I hadn't, he gave me the gist of it. Four days later, I'm writing this review. The Long Walk is an amazing look at the human experience, both good and bad, that demands just as much from its readers as it does from its characters. If this book doesn't make you question your life, your past, or your faith nothing will.    Secondly, to those who don't like the end of the book, I have to ask, what did you expect? The reasons how this walk began and why exactly these kids do is never answered, why should the ending be any more clear? Then of course, there's always the old fail safe, \\"It's the journey, not the destination, that's the thing.\\" But with all that said, I'd argue that there is a pretty definitive ending, it's just not spelled out for you in black and white. The author's asking you to stretch your legs (and imagination) a little, and join the Walkers, to see what they see...

B001QOGYB8|5.0|It's been a long time since I've seen a movie like this. At first, the animation looks a little cheap. The walks aren't that realistic. But after you get into the story, you don't care. The world is textured. It's beautiful. We don't see this kind of movie anymore, this stop-motion, and I don't know if it's simply just been too long since I've seen other stop-motion films like Chicken Run or what--I was enthralled.    This movie did not have an overly-typical storyline, but at the same time, it was not devoid of one either. The jokes were not written to try and provoke you to laugh out loud; you'll simply find them funny, perhaps to chuckle. But the thing I really loved about the movie was this--there was a lot of life in the film. Real life, something I identified with in the characters.    Don't expect a typical Phase 1, Phase 2, Climax, Ending, kind of film. Don't expect to be drawn into the story and be spit back out. This isn't exactly a story that ends with a clever line--it ends with the characters dancing. But I can guarantee you that you will enjoy this movie. It wasn't a \\"good\\" movie. It wasn't a \\"bad\\" movie. It was an \\"enjoyable\\" movie. And it's a higher honor to be an enjoyable movie rather than just a \\"good\\" one.

B0017ANAZO|3.0|Mary Haines (Meg Ryan) is a successful housewife. Her busy schedule keeps her name on the lips of society and her daughter adores her, but it seems her husband is discontent. Steven Haines is having an affair with a perfume girl (Eva Mendes). Suddenly the gossip is out, and although her friends (Annette Benning, Debra Messing, Jada Pinkett Smith) try to help her deal with the pain of the situation, Mary decides to divorce her husband.<br /><br />The movie starts strong. The dialogue is witty, the characters are energetic and interesting, and the plot moves along nicely. It is updated to modern times flawlessly, and these girls resemble the famous friends from Sex in the City.<br /><br />Toward the end, however, the movie veers off into an alley of sentiment and turns into a full-on chic-flick. We see a woman become independent and powerful and achieve the dreams she never realized, made for audiences to shout \\"You go, girl!\\" in the background. Best friends have a fight and then cry together over their great relationship. It all culminates in a delivery room where women bond over the ability to have babies. Disgusting.<br /><br />Still, this re-make is superior to that starring June Allyson and Joan Collins which is much less exciting in spite of how cheesy this one becomes.<br /><br />It is always nice to see a great screen writer from the past appear in the credits of a film, even if it isn't a wonderful remake. However, it retains a lot of the great elements of the past. There are no men in his film, a gimmick ignored in the Allyson remake but a memorable part of the original. Also, the \\"jungle red\\" nail polish, the bathtub scene with Crystal Allen, and the lingerie scene (This one is quite a bit more risque).
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|Definitely Top's best record, for my money, Tres Hombres has been restored to its original vinyl mix, but compressed like every other modern production. Why can't they just leave the dynamic range as it was on the classic first pressings of rock's greats? Are they afraid our ears can't take a little subtlety any more? This is better than the six-pack version, but it still ain't the real deal.<br /><br />I got lucky and just found an original first pressing of this last week in a 99 cent bin (there are indeed many advantages to living in Tejas!), fold-out cover and all; that picture of the gloppy nachos is special. I was reminded of how truly great a band Top was back in the day. Billy's tone is so sweet; there's a guy who knows what gits to match with what amps. The vinyl sounds so much richer than this remix, scratches and all. And it was 1/6th of the price. I still say cds are a ripoff.<br /><br />Some of their best tunes are here: Bus/Chicago and La Grange are about as good as they ever got. Gibbons' pinch harmonics on Grange started a whole new school and inspired Eddie a ton, as he's said (add the whammy and there's your early VH sound, if you've ever heard the boots from Halen's high school gigs). Beard and Hill are locked-in, laying down their fat groove as always, a huge key to why ZZ have always been so legendary: they can all play their nuts off.<br /><br />There are no bad tunes here, only classics and good rockers. Precious and Grace sure sounds like a tribute to speedballs; Billy's habits have always been kept kind of quiet, but he wrote about them all the time. Why you think he's been rail thin for 40 years anyhow? But as that and La Grange and Beer Drinkers testify, these guys were never churchgoers. They were hardcore party dogs and this album has been the soundtrack to millions of hardcore parties over the past 36 years, count on that.<br /><br />Play this back to back with Eliminator and, as good as that record is, you'll see that this is some of the best chicken-fried truly southern rock ever put on wax.<br /><br />And if you can, find the used vinyl to hear what these songs are really supposed to sound like.hern rock ever put on wax.     And if you can, find the used vinyl to hear what these songs are really supposed to sound like.

B000F4LPJ6|2.0|Sorry.. didn't work for me... I certainly get the point though. This life is nothing if not predictable in its utterly cruel way of recurring behavioral patterns. The key-words nowadays are \\"cool\\" and \\"hip\\" forms of parenting, in a ridiculous attempt to identify with the up-and-coming generations of alienated youths. Boundaries are blurred. Parents abandon their stoic posture and yield to hedonism, refuting egregiously their years of experience. When purposeful regression takes center stage, all hell will break loose. So, when haughty, hormone-driven adolescents see that they have their affection-deprived parents on their knees, a greater sense of already-gargantuan entitlement takes over. And this extends into the every sphere of life, especially in social gatherings, and even more in the classroom, where hiding under the surface of blatant infantile behavior lies intensely insecure thought processes. Anyway, the fabric of school tries to institute a neo-superego, but since the primordial one has been vanquished, why should this one be allowed to prevail??? It shouldn't, that's why students just don't care, and their parents are too afraid of losing their children completely (a cataclysmic death of self as well, since children are the redefinition of their rebirth) and simply don't choose to emphasize the importance of education. The movie tried to take the side of the kids, giving everyone a brief background that tries to be inspiring... it vilifies some of them as well so we know who to cheer against (there is an ineffectual attempt to humanize the girl with the scythe by showing her brush with a potential child molester). Now, the solution in this case is pure fascism, and it is a very moronic way of looking at life. The reason we have so many school shootings and whatnot in the US is because the culture causes a spiritual suffocation and death, there is no room for negotiation, there are no shades of gray, so extreme behaviors are adopted to get the point across. Here, it's the same thing, adopting radical dogmas for a much deeper-seeded behavioral issue that derives from the adults' lack of insight into self and how to raise their kids... bah... I usually try to stick with the story in my reviews, not focusing on technical aspects. Unfortunately, I must comment, the acting was very poor.. I love to be drawn into the realm of the film, but I simply couldn't because none of it rang true or believable. Anyway, in essence, an unnecessary statement which echoes the dumb way the world perceives its problems, and the primitive way it intends to resolve them.

I couldn't wait to open the CD and listen to Susan sing. I was in the process of making hubby's favorite potato soup, so I put the CD on, and the sound of Susan's beautiful voice filled the kitchen, as did the aroma of the potato soup! WOW....AWESOME....BEAUTIFUL! When hubby returned home from errands, he was absolutely delighted to hear the beautiful voice of Susan singing, and the aroma of soup cooking! I have to admit, I had some tears flowing as well. Susan has ARRIVED! Her beautiful voice and the songs on this CD are absolutely amazing, and set the tone for a delicious winter dinner with Susan singing. It doesn't get any better! I have played the CD over and over. We are hoping that Susan will do a Christmas CD next year, to include \\"O Holy Night\\", our favorite Christmas song. Best wishes for many years of success to Susan!  Thank you to Amazon for the great service, and Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to everyone! God bless!

0199537623|5.0|Greed, gold-digging and deception sit at the heart of \\"Vanity Fair.\\" It's no joke that it's subtitled \\"a novel without a hero\\" -- William Makepeace Thackeray mercilessly skewered the pretentions and flaws of the upper class all throughout it. The result is a gloriously witty social satire.<br /><br />It opens with two young women departing from a ladies' academy: dull, sweet Amelia (rich) and fiery sharp-witted Rebecca (poor). Becky Sharp is a relentless social climber, and her first effort to rise \\"above her station\\" is by trying to get Amelia's brother to marry her -- an effort thwarted by Amelia's fiancee. So instead she gets married to another family's second son, Rawdon Crawley.<br /><br />Unfortunately, both young couples quickly get disinherited and George is killed. But Becky is determined to live the good life she has worked and married for -- she obtains jewels and money from admiring gentlemen, disrupting her marriage. But a little thing like a tarnished reputation isn't enough to keep Becky down...<br /><br />\\"Vanity Fair\\" is actually a lot more complex than that, with dozens of little subplots and complicated character relationships. Reading it a few times is necessary to really absorb all of it, since it is not just a look at the two women in the middle of the book, but at the upper (and sometimes lower) social strata of the nineteenth century.<br /><br />The main flaw of the book is perhaps that it sprawls too much -- there's always a lot of stuff going on, not to mention a huge cast of characters, and Thackeray sometimes drops the ball when it comes to the supporting characters and their little plots. It takes a lot of patience to absorb all of this. However... it's worth it.<br /><br />Like most nineteenth-century writers, Thackeray had a very dense, formal writing style -- but once you get used to it, his writing becomes insanely funny. Witticisms and quips litter the pages, even if you don't pick them all up at once. At first Thackeray seems incredibly cynical (Becky's little schemes almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.<br /><br />Becky Sharp is the quintessential anti-heroine -- she's very greedy and cold, yet she's also so smart and determined that it's hard not to have a grudging liking for her. Certainly life hasn't been fair for her. Next to Becky, a goody-goody character like Amelia is pretty boring, and even the unsubtle George can't measure up to Becky.<br /><br />To sum up \\"Vanity Fair\\": think a period soap opera with a heavy dose of social commentary. In other words, it doesn't get much better than this, Thackeray's masterpiece.s almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.

0061864153|4.0|How does a band sum up over 25 years worth of career that's spanned more than half their lead singer's life, thousands of concerts, and sales of well over 120 million albums? Not to mention survived more than 8 different music trends (at last count)and umpteen label management changes (10? 12?), while doing their own thing. By Jovi, this'd better be good.    Bon Jovi: When We Were Beautiful is indeed a very good anthology of a great career. Arranged by subject instead of the more predictable chronological order, it's narrated by the band members themselves and loaded with photos from a perspective rarely seen of the band, who publicly admit to not letting many people into their tight circle. There's much here to surprise the public, and maybe even a few hard core fans.    For one thing, this is not a picture book full of pretty, posed studio photographs of cute guys in the 80's. Although a couple of those are there for scrapbook purposes, the majority of the book's photos are either original, Phil Stern-style behind-the-scenes candids that were snapped for the book and its accompanying documentary (many of these photos are in black and white) or are photos of the band onstage. In both cases, the style and quality of the photographer's work shares equal billing with the subjects, with great results.    As a serious photography hobbyist, the photos on pages 8-9,13,15,43,126-27,and 137 are among my favorites, because I know how deceptively difficult they are to do. Because of this, my copy of Bon Jovi: When We Were Beautiful isn't kept with the other music biographies in my collection. Instead, it resides on a shelf of favorite photography books, between works by Phil Stern and Life Magazine: these are the kind of artist photographs I'd like to achieve.    When We Were Beautiful also contains snapshots from the band members' personal collections, photo session outtakes, and previously unapproved photos. Some of these are hilariously not so great...such as the series ofan extremely sleepy/sleeping Jon Bon Jovi on a plane to Moscow in 1989 (page 48-49), complete with large red X's and thick lines drawn on the photos to indicate someone's disapproval (presumably management's or Jon's). Every major artist has marked-up contact sheets of unapproved, goofy photos in their files. Bon Jovi actually lets you see them.    The text shows the expected business savvy, tenacity, and personal growth of the individual band members, as well as their wit (David Bryan, page 59--drinking liquid while reading not recommended). But it can also be surprisingly revealing, such as on page 138. There's even an \\"Eeeeew\\"-provoking gross-out moment from, of all people, Jon Bon Jovi (page 142).    From a practical standpoint, for aspiring artists (and their aspiring managers and tour managers), the Backstage section is most helpful, especially Jon's wisdom on page 139. Pages 138-144, 150,152, and 175 are of special note...particularly page 152, which gives the reader something to think about.    Bon Jovi:When We Were Beautiful is certainly not the type of sordid tell-all that publishers and the media like to see from a rock band, so don't expect this book to get much media attention. Nor is it the bare-it-all autobiography a lot of rock fans and celebrity watchers may prefer. But by all accounts, Bon Jovi are guys who deeply respect their families, especially their kids, who don't happen to be in the spotlight. In Jersey parlance, ya gotta respect that. And ya gotta respect the band for doing it their way.    After all, it's worked for 26 years.      Full disclosure of Endorsements/recommendations/disclolosure of financial compensation or business relationships per FTC Blog Dsiclosure Regulations in effect as of December 1, 2009: In the 90's I worked for a concert promotion company that presented many Bon Jovi shows.

B001GKJ2FC|1.0|Bought this BD along with a well recommended LG BD Player and not to mention other BD titles. All the BD's that I bought (through amazon at the same time with this title) seemed to have worked perfectly with the LG BD Player EXCEPT for this one. Bought this around October and it has never been opened till today because I was waiting for the perfect time to watch it. So disappointing.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|Musically and lyrically, this CD is a strong partner to the Heroin Diaries book, and it has some of the best guitar production I've heard in a long time...possibly ever. And James Michael's soaring vocal on the triumphant \\"Life is Beautiful\\" is simply beyond words.
1416550542|5.0|I would give this book a 10 if I could.  Loved it...absolutely amazing....the story is fantastic.<br /><br />All the mysteries and secrets of the Mountrachet family are revealed....the ending is superb.<br /><br />The story goes back and forth in time telling the story of how little Nell was put on a boat to Australia without an adult and how the portmaster and his wife in Australia took her in as their own.  Nell's life makes a complete turn around for her when her father tells her on her 21st birthday that she isn't really his child.<br /><br />The book tells of the generations before and after Nell.  It is masterfully written...you don't want to put it down until you find out who Nell really is and until you find all the secrets about how she arrived on the boat and in Australia and the significance of the  forgotten garden....the garden plays a huge part in the unraveling of the secrets and mysteries in the book.<br /><br />I usually don't re-read books, but I would re-read this just to be sure I \\"got\\" all the facts straight...it was just fantastic....the story was very clever and the characters unforgettable....I didn't want the book to end.
0743486285|5.0|In 1986-87, Nikki Sixx seemed to have it all: hugely successful albums, sold out concerts, and a jet set lifestyle as songwriter and bassist, and co-founder of one of the most popular bands in the 80's. All this, at the height of a career he'd dreamed of since he was a teenager.      All this, also at the height of a major drug addiction to cocaine and heroin.    The Heroin Diaries is, without a doubt, the best book I've ever read about addiction. It's a wild ride that takes you right along with Nikki--make that drags you by the collar--through a myriad of emotions Sixx was apparently trying to dull with drugs, including anger, frustration, sadness, loneliness, and confusion. The book also documents Sixx's wild wide from the perspective of people who were around him at the time, such as ex-manager Doc McGhee and Karen Dumont, a label employee who moved in to Sixx's home to house sit while he was on tour but who in reality stayed on to try to keep an eye on him. (It should be noted that Dumont was later  nicknamed \\"Karen DuPont Dumont\\" within the music industry, for her Teflon-strong resilience.)           The Heroin Diaries and its subject matter is serious, but it's also entertaining.  The entries range from sad and pathetic to hilarious, and despite knowing the outcome, as I read it I found myself alternately saying, \\"Get it together, Nikki\\" or feeling genuinely sad at the potential loss of an often-witty human being should his latest attempt at rehab fail.    But along with all that, as someone who grew up around (and lost) an addicted loved one, I found the Heroin Diaries to be incredibly insightful whenever I least expected it.    Recommended for: Motley Crue fans, loved ones of addicts, people who want to learn more about addiction, aspiring artist managers.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing.  It is well written with many interesting characters.  This is not your typical Tolkeinish fantasy eithier.  Most of the characters are not strictly good or bad but somewhere in between.  If you are thinking about buying this book you definitely should.  It is well worth it especially if you are an avid fantasy reader looking for something a little different from the standard plotline ie. the poor servant boy going on a magical journey and eventually becoming king.  I have read the first four books in the series and am anxiously awaiting the fifth.  I am also looking forward to the forthcoming HBO show based on the books.  If you do buy this book make sure you have ample time to read because it is impossible to put down!
0060989157|5.0|A must-read for Motley Crue fans and rock fans, but also for any aspiring band manager, because in addition to documenting the band's rise, it's a prime example of what should NOT happen...    Excellent background on each band member about what motivated each individual to a career in the music industry--reading about Nikki Sixx's childhood is especially difficult but explains a lot--as well as highly entertaining, too-crazy-to-be-false stories about the band's exploits.      For aspiring band managers, the book is an excellent chronicle of each member's individual reaction to the band's fame and fortune, and the factors that eventually drove the band apart.    Bottom line: a thoughtful, entertaining, well-written, and useful How NOT to book!
B001VLXNLU|4.0|This book is one of the best vampire books I have ever read, and even though I am only thirteen I have read a ton of vampire books. Unlike some other books I have read this book hooked me from start to finish. I thought about it all the time and when I wasn't reading it I was thinking about how I could get out of school or anywhere else I was at so that I could read it. I can't wait to buy the second one. If you haven't read this book I truly recommend it. It will have you hanging on to every word and begging for more.  P.S: I LOVE NALA
B0001GMIOE|1.0|A little bit in doubt here. I ordered original Canon battery BP-511A but I've got some kind of very bad replacement of different color of stick-on label, weight and of course capacity etc. I will try to upload pictures of this one where certain signs can be seen to compare original Canon against fake / replacement.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|The Matrix trilogy truly resides in my mind as the the best sci-fi trilogy of the 90s/21st Century, full mind-blowing action. The Matrix Revolutions may not be as memorable as The Matrix or The Matrix Reloaded, but it is definitely worth watching. Picking up right after The Matrix Reloaded, the fate of Zion rests in the balance of Neo.<br /><br />The films starts great with an excellent chase scene in The Matrix to save Neo, the middle of the film contains contains a spectacular battle sequence as the machines invade Zion, and a Superman style fight amazes me the most at the end. The Wachowski Brothers are truly genius when it comes to satisfying an audience, a great score also helps enthrall us. The only downside to the film is it can be very dull at times between the big fight sequences.<br /><br />The only available DVD version is the 2-Disc version which is great! The movie can be found quite cheap quite often, and it is worth the price (I would pay 30 for it!).  The Second disk is packed with special features that truly take time to watch through completely. The only downside to the film is that their are no commentaries to go alongside the film. I have no regrets since I purchased this film and never film. A trilogy I will never forget.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|Rome is packaged in attractive packaging.  It is not too bulky which I think is a plus.  The blu-rays are packed creatively and securely.    The series itself is phenomenal.  The acting, the sets, the stories; all excellent.    The only drawback it was too short (only 2 seasons).    I would have loved to see the continuing adventures, but sadly it will probably not happen (just like Deadwood HBO).
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Simon Pegg and Nick Frost plus Director Edgar Wright is just perfect.  I have rewatched this film several times and every time I enjoy it! Sure its a comedic parody of the Romero zombie films, but its just great! I cannot recommend this film enough to anyone who is a fan of comedy or even zombie films. Simon Pegg stars as average Joe Shaun, Nick Frost is his slacker friend, and Kate Ashfeild plays as Shaun's girlfriend. The film also stars Lucy Davis of The Office fame. Plus a small role by the great Bill Nighy! Its a Romantic comedy with zombies! Whats not to like?<br /><br />The DVD contains superb commentaries by the cast and crew, even with lack of features the commentaries alone are worth it! Someday I hope the film gets deluxe treatment in a home video release, it deserves a super special edition!<br /><br />Special Features:<br />Missing Bits-Outrageous outtakes and all-new deleted scenes not shown in theaters<br />Raw Meat-casting tapes,Simon Pegg's video dairy and special effects comparisons<br />Un-Censored Commentary-with cast and crew, zombie photo gallery, Zomb-0-Meter (zombie trivia) and more!

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Here's a movie Eastwood made in between two \\"big\\" films, a modest film that nevertheless looked braver than what most of the indie world's been producing and completely kicked Hollywood high budget movie asses by staying at or near the top of the box office for months.

0061719544|5.0|Ever since we happened upon the author's show, we have been recording it every night to watch the following morning. Even before reading this book, we have picked up hints in the midst of his popular-culture banter that his range of knowledge is very deep. Few talk-show hosts evidence as impressive an acquaintance with history, literature, languages, music and art as Craig Ferguson, nor do they wax as profound (and personal) as he chooses to do on occasion.   His book was predictably hilarious, and demonstrates how versatile and brilliant he is. He is not only an accidental American, but an accidental writer, film producer, actor and comedian. He is also a great example of an autodidact (to use his word), another testament to his brilliance.   The writing is engaging and flows, and the final pages inspiringly wrap up the narrative.

B00000DHR0|4.0|I can understand why this album has remained popular since its debut more than 10 years ago. Her producers were very smart including not only popular catholic christmas anthems but also jewesh, she even sing in spanish. Celine vocals praise the Lord, Jesuschrist and Moses at the same time, and as expected she sings in a very classical way, it will surely suit the taste of 40+ people. Overall very good album, just a step below the greatest for me (Elvis first Christmas album, Mariah Carey's Merry Christmas and Trans Siberian's Christmas eve...)
0061673730|1.0|What tripe. This is probably the best selling philosophy book ever, but I'm still trying to figure out what Pirsig's \\"philosophy\\" is. It's got something to do with \\"Quality.\\" That's all I could glean from it. The importance of Quality in our lives is illustrated by this book, which has none. It's said that 147 publishers passed on this before it became a best seller, which should inspire confidence that the waste of enough time will ultimately result in something, kind of like the billion monkeys who type the Bible at random.<br /><br />Pirsig admits this book has NOTHING to do with Zen and NOTHING MUCH to do with motorcycles. If Pirsig really did know anything about Zen he would have burned this book once he'd typed the dedication page.<br /><br />I read this book in 1974 and 1980. and 1994, and 2009---Okay, so I only read it cover-to-cover once, in '74, when I didn't know any better and I thought it was deep. Kids.<br /><br />This was the first \\"Zen and the Art of\\" book, and its inexplicable popularity is reflected in the fact that seven billion subsequent books hijacked the title. About 6,999,999,998 of those subsequent books are better, and should trace their lineage to Eugen Herrigel's ZEN IN THE ART OF ARCHERY which is a great book, and which inspired Pirsig's title. Truth be told, the title is the most memorable thing about this book.<br /><br />What's wrong with ZEN AND THE ART OF MOTORCYCLE MAINTENANCE? Well, it's a long, long boring read. It's also self-indulgent, ego-ridden, rambling, and completely dry. Pirsig's story revolves around a motorcycle trip taken with his son. During the trip he ignores the boy utterly (except to emotionally abuse him), and spends 99% of his time in flatulent speculations on the nature of existence. He's pathologically critical of others and addicted to self-praise and superficial examination of his own problems. Yadda, yadda.<br /><br />I can remember only one moment of any lyric beauty, when Pirsig describes the scent of honeysuckle. The problem with Pirsig's approach is that he's an objectivist first and a subjectivist second. In ZEN AND THE ART OF MOTORCYCLE MAINTENANCE he's trying to write objectively about what are subjective experiences. Trying to make it dance, he ends up with something that clanks when it walks heavy-footed across your frontal lobe.<br /><br />Why then, was this coma-inducing pile of typing so successful? Firstly, it represented the high-water mark of, and epitomized, the \\"Me Decade\\" that gave birth to it. Secondly, it was just dull enough and filled with enough funny names and five dollar words to have readers believing it was really good and they were really dense for not getting it. It remains a biggie because it lives off its reputation as a \\"classic.\\"<br /><br />What this all boils down to is that Pirsig made millions convincing people that they were stupid and that he was smart.approach is that he's an objectivist first and a subjectivist second.

B002ZTQVGQ|4.0|Among my favorite anime films are Hayao Miyazaki`s \\"Princess Mononoke\\" and \\"Spirited Away\\" (won Best Animated film); those two films are truly masterworks of animation accompanied by a very intricate storyline. \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" was good but I thought it was a bit of a mixed bag. Miyazaki's eighth film for Japanese animation company \\"Studio Ghibli\\", \\"PONYO On The Cliff\\" (full title: Gake No Ue No Ponyo) has been imported by Disney to U.S. shores on a limited theatrical run. The way to approach any of Miyazaki's films is to temper your expectations; although honestly, hearing about another Miyazaki film is just so delightful that any Miyazaki fan would become excited. \\"Ponyo\\" is more a family-friendly film that uses the traditional hand drawn animation instead of CGI. This has been promoted as Miyazaki's last film.<br /><br />Sosuke (voiced by Doi Hiroki) is a young boy who lives with his young mom Lisa (voiced by Yamaguchi Tomoko) in a small house on a cliff that overlooks a small port in Japan (Based on Seto Island) One day, he encounters a magical sea sprite/goldfish that he found on the beach who he names \\"Ponyo\\". Taking the magical creature to wherever he goes, the two have such a good bonding because of a certain cured meat called \\"ham'. But as soon as the two become close, Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji) a former human who has rejected the surface world who has become a sea sorcerer who collects magical elixirs is hot on Ponyo's trail. He takes Ponyo back (who he calls Brunhilde) back to the depths, but Ponyo now desires to become human and to be with Sosuke; a desire so strong that she breaks out of Fujimoto's undersea lair that causes the his elixirs to be unleashed on an unsuspecting world that causes a major storm that threatens the island. Fujimoto seeks out the aid of Ponyo's mother, a water element dubbed as the Mother of the Sea (voiced by Yuki Amami) to try and put things back to normal before the sea engulfs the surface...<br /><br />Written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, \\"Ponyo\\" is a film with a very simple premise that borrows some elements from \\"The Little Mermaid\\". As with Miyazaki's past films, the film has strong messages about ecology and environmentalism that focuses on the well-being of the world's oceans. The opening scene with all the pollution, debris and garbage in the ocean makes a very strong commentary, these sequences give justification as to why Fujimoto would leave the life of a surface dweller. Fujimoto has taken it upon himself to try to repair the damage this has caused, but all appears to be fruitless as the oceans are damaged faster than he could anticipate. Some of the environmental messages may appear too heavy-handed but Miyazaki is a master of fantasy-storytelling and he manages to overcome the film's flaws.<br /><br />The film's central focus falls on the friendship between Sosuke and Ponyo. Sosuke exhibits this optimistic innocence that is just so full of life. Ponyo as the sea sprite is just so cute and adorable.<br />I admit to a certain extent, that the film does take its time getting to its goals. However, the first half is also full of charm, warmth and endearing scenes that would please any viewer of any age. Once Ponyo reverts to a human however, the film gets into gear as the viewer is treated to an animated visual marvel that is quite refreshing to see in these days dominated by CGI animation. Seeing a colorful, great visual achievement using traditional cell animation is so cool to look at, Miyazaki still proves that one doesn't need CGI to deliver a good animated film. Miyazaki has the eye to deliver something truly fantastic as well as bizarre and outrageous; Miyazaki intentionally made the drawings to resemble the use of crayons and pencils to make them superbly reflective of a child's imagination. The animation work is truly charming that retains the look of a kid's coloring book given life and motion. The animation work by Katsuma Kondo is excellent for the film's tone.<br /><br />Child actors Nara Yuria and Doi Hiroki do magnificent work as Ponyo and Sosuke. I will NOT give credit to the English voice cast by Disney at all, since I saw this in its original form. Anime is meant to be seen in Japanese, English dubbed work is often abysmal. Nara Yuria is magnificent as Ponyo. Her voice portrayal fits the infantile charm and wit exhibited by her animated counterpart. She sounds so cute and adorable on some scenes, it comes as no surprise that Doi Hiroki would fall for the magical sea sprite turned human. Tomoko Yamaguchi is also awesome as Sosuke's mom. Tomoko is a model and I could just feel her `vibe' as her youthful, energetic young woman. I was a little confused as to why Sosuke kept on referring to her as Lisa instead of mom, but perhaps this is just a reflection on the more modern Japanese family. Comedian Joji Tokoro is great as Fujimoto. His character is full of weird potential but sadly, Miyazaki doesn't really flesh his character out more thoroughly. I would have loved to see more of the relationships between Sosuke and his father as well as more of Fujimoto's background. Everything did feel like they had to take a back seat in favor of the visuals. I also would have liked more undersea world detail as rendered by Miyazaki.<br /><br />In this world, Ponyo represents the oceans and Sosuke represents the surface world. There are some parallels to the friendship between the two to the relationship between Fujimoto and the Mother of the Sea. Miyazaki seems to be giving the viewer that for the world to succeed, man and his environment need to work in unison. Man needs to respect and love his environment for what it is, and not change anything for his own selfish motives. Love, sincerity and compassion are needed to save the planet.<br /><br />Miyazaki Hayao's \\"Ponyo\\" is a little light in the dramatic areas and ends up better as an adventure `exploration' film than an actual undersea journey. It will not match \\"Princess Mononoke\\" and \\"Spirited Away\\" in raw brilliance. The film does suffer a bit within the limits it imposed on itself, Miyazaki's talent still shines through and I hope that this isn`t his last film. Miyazaki has crafted another modern fairy tale that can be appreciated by the young and old alike. It is a timeless story of friendship, love and adventure that exhibit's an endearing warmth that cannot be soon forgotten.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!!

B001AVCFJM|5.0|I highly recommend this film.  For those who do not know Star Trek, it will invite you to learn more. For returning fans, it is evident that the creators and the actors studied the original cast.  The mannerisms and actions of the new crew are exactly as we would expect them to be.  Especially in his role is the actor who plays Dr. McCoy; he seems to have even captured the voice of \\"Bones\\".  The adventure and action is non-stop.  The emotions pulled out of you are direct and to the heart.  This is such a powerful representation of a SciFi icon.  It's a must see.
0393061310|4.0|The author mainly argues that societies developed differently on different continents because of advantages in geography, not advantages in human biology. In the book, we can conclude that there are four reasons to account for all historical development. Firstly, it is the number of the crops and animals to be domesticated. The second reason is the speed of agriculture development in the continents. The next reason is the knowledge communication between different continents. The forth reason is the size of population. Diamond argues that all of four factors have convincing evidences. And Diamond was able to explain geographical factors integrating knowledge from a wide range of subjects, including molecular biology, epidemiology, human genetics, linguistics, and archaeology. The book demonstrates the depth of the author's technical, linguistic, political, historical research. To the author's credit, when reading this book, I find myself accepting the term `geographical determinism' almost unconsciously. The theory Diamond sets forth is convincing enough, but the reality is more complex than simple geographical determinism--there are other factors at work, like culture and human decision, especially after the Neolithic Revolution.<br /><br />This is an impressive book. On the one hand, Diamond answers the complex question, \\"why did Eurasians conquer, displace or decimate Native Americans, Australians, and Africans, instead of the reverse?\\" using only three tiny objects: guns, germs and steel. Guns influence the course of political development. Germs are an additional thread of this transfer of power. Steel gives us a clue into technical advancement. The author does not get lost in complicated and trivial factors; on the contrary, he dismantles racially-based theory through analyzing environmental factors in the human history. On the other hand, Diamond brings to the book a great breadth of knowledge. When he began quoting writers from the Zhou Dynasty (first millennium BC), describing history many Chinese aren't even aware of, I was convinced of his credibility. As a scientist, I was able to appreciate Diamond's ability to express intricate and often inaccessible microbiological concepts in a clear way, to convey the magic of the microbial world to readers with a more general background. Take, for example, his description of the microbe's side of the spread of disease:<br /><br />\\"Many of our `symptoms' of disease actually represent ways in which some damned clever microbe modifies our bodies or our behavior such that we become enlisted to spread microbes... the strategy practiced by the influenza, common cold, and pertussis (whooping cough) microbes, which induce the victim to cough or sneeze, thereby launching a cloud of microbes toward prospective new hosts.\\"<br /><br /> As well-researched and thorough as it was, when you leave the book, you will have a suspicion that the author intentionally ignored the adverse evidences to support his opinions. In James Blaut's article, \\"Environmentalism and Eurocentrism\\", \\"he pointed out examples of North-South diffusion of crops, notably the cultivation of maize in both Peru and North America (1999)\\". But the book did not mention that several important crops that grow outside the temperate parts of Europe. And as a Chinese reader, I cannot eliminate a feeling that the writer always is looking for the evidence to support genetic racial equality while perhaps ignoring evidence that might suggest otherwise.<br /><br />In the book, Wealth and Poverty of Nations, author David Landes said \\"China's conscious decision in the 1400's to isolate itself from other nations was the key event that caused it to lose its technological advantage and fall behind Europe\\". Diamond also addresses this point from a geographical view. His argument: China was able to become a monolithic, autocratic country because of geographical factors, most importantly, its geographic connectedness. However, I think it is toosimple to explain why China fell behind Europe. More explanation can be drawn from a cultural basis, such as political freedom, capitalism and open debate. The thoughts of Confucius were embedded deeply into the people of China for almost 5,000 years, and Chinese people innately believed agriculture was more important than commerce and industry. Although the commerce made a progress to some extent, they did not pay enough attention to it thus advanced industry could not be developed quickly. Also, the prevailing notion that people should stay loyal to the emperor and never resist, allowed the Chinese people to blindly accept they were the so-called super-country the emperor claimed. Actually they had ability to explore new lands, but their culture told them they were strongest and they did not need to do so.<br /><br />According to the statistics outlined in Andre Frank's, Reorient: Global Economy in the Asian Age, during the Ming Dynasty, China had a much stronger economy than Europe. Thus the Chinese found no need to conquer other countries for economic gain, instead focusing on the inner economical. The book did not address this point.<br /><br />Cultural elements do work in the human history development. But there is a question why different countries have different cultural thoughts. Now that genetic biology is not the reason, geographical environment shaped the basic ring of human history. But Diamond could not clearly answer why Confucius thoughts emerged in China, not other places, so did Socrates in Europe. The complexity of the issue may, in itself, explain why this was not addressed in this book.<br /><br />In summary, this book exhibits us a new picture of human history from a specific view of selecting three representative objects. In the book, you can view the fate of human societies from new vantage points. But you should have a bit of skepticism, because while Diamond convincingly argues that geographical elements play a vital role in the human history, culture and human decisions are also important.ll behind Europe. More explanation can be drawn from a cultural basis, such as political freedom, capitalism and open debate. The thoughts of Confucius were embedded deeply into the people of China for almost 5,000 years, and Chinese people innately believed agriculture was more important than commerce and industry.

Actually they had ability to explore new lands, but their culture told them they were strongest and they did not need to do so.    According to the statistics outlined in Andre Frank's, Reorient: Global Economy in the Asian Age, during the Ming Dynasty, China had a much stronger economy than Europe. Thus the Chinese found no need to conquer other countries for economic gain, instead focusing on the inner economical. The book did not address this point.      Cultural elements do work in the human history development. But there is a question why different countries have different cultural thoughts. Now that genetic biology is not the reason, geographical environment shaped the basic ring of human history. But Diamond could not clearly answer why Confucius thoughts emerged in China, not other places, so did Socrates in Europe. The complexity of the issue may, in itself, explain why this was not addressed in this book.    In summary, this book exhibits us a new picture of human history from a specific view of selecting three representative objects. In the book, you can view the fate of human societies from new vantage points. But you should have a bit of skepticism, because while Diamond convincingly argues that geographical elements play a vital role in the human history, culture and human decisions are also important.

B00104W8T6|5.0|The cd came in a reasonable time, the price was great, and it was still in the original wrapping. It came NEW as advertised. I didnt open it yet because it's part of my daughter's Xmas gift, but I'm pretty sure the cd should play good.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|I am an 11 year old who loves to read and when my dad first got me this kindle a couple of weeks ago, I was overjoyed. He downloaded a christmas carol and when i finished the book, I decided it was my favorite. I am amazed that story was that interesting and is perfect for all.
B000JK8OYU|3.0|Listening to THE BEATLES LOVE - one of the more recent re-mixed adaptations to 26 of The Beatles' best remembered work, I'm glad to see that it's not just another \\"never found or played before\\" collection of rehearsals or bloopers recordings... not that those aren't interesting to die-hard Beatles fans like myself, but there're enough of them going around so that we don't need another -- unless it's taped-recordings of Paul telling John how he predicts the impact of Yoko Ono (so much that her name would later be used metaphorically in describing how some relationships can come between the interests and bond of legendary partnerships)... but enough digressions.    LOVE is a great effort by the Martins, of which the elder, George, is responsible for taking helm of The Beatles' talent and having led them on their path to greatness. Remember this album is meant to be a score for the Cirque du Soleil performance, and it works very well for that specific purpose... and possibly bring new interests to a much younger generation of audience so they would revisit some of the great, original, work by The Beatles.    There are a few tracks that work very well, in my opinion, especially the charged-up mix to GET BACK & Sgt. PEPPERS, while others come across as sounding very Star 45 medley-like. Some of the earlier reviews above mine favor the acousticized version of WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS, which I don't think works except to help move it into Andrew Lloyd Webber territory. What is most impressive to me is the fact that tracks such as YESTERDAY, LADY MADONNA, HEY JUDE, ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE, etc, are really not too different from the original tracks -- yes there's the added percussion to some, while others combine parts of other Beatles songs as the lead-in (goes to show how difficult it is when you try to improve what is near-perfection to begin with - EVEN when this is done by the man who helped create the original work!) - The remixes mostly work, except for the reversed\\"SUN KING,\\" which, to me, is only academically important in reminding the audience that they are the early pioneers in innovative mixing and experimentation during post-production.     All in all, listening to this album will help already-fans of The Beatles revive their interest and dig up the earlier \\"original\\" work, which [for me at least] is now mostly relegated to be a part of Oldies format radio's playlist... and the years of \\"never heard before, but we found it under Yoko's mattress/Stella's crib\\" simply served to turn everything \\"sepia\\" and trivial for the group whose work symbolizes a generation of legendary innovations in the history of Rock & Roll.
0679746323|2.0|I have to say I'm a bit disappointed in this book.  It's an easy read - I only have about 40 pages left.  However, I walked into this book knowing nothing about Mao - and not having an opinion in either direction.    The book is best when it sticks to the facts.  I *do* feel that I've learned a great deal from this book.  However, as others have pointed out, it repeatedly strays into discussing things it can't possible know about.  There are hundreds of instances in this book where the authors site what Mao was thinking when a particular event occurred - even though Mao (nor any one else) said a word (or wrote a word) about what they were thinking.  It is very clear that this is a book meant to attack what the author feels (probably rightly) is a pretty sanitized official mythology of Mao.  I can appreciate that.  But I think the authors, perhaps, don't have enough respect for their readers to form their own opinions based on the facts.    To be sure, you will probably finish this easy-to-read book feeling like Mao was a monster - I'm pretty sure he was.  However, I wish the authors hadn't made me feel so dirty in coming to this conclusion.  By being so one-sided, they planted doubt of their original premise - which does a disservice to the victims of Mao.  I'll look for something more scholarly nexttime.
B0002NRQTI|5.0|After listening to the weak production Presto and Roll The Bones suffered at the hands of producer Rupert Hine, the awesome production of Counterparts was (and is) nothing short of impressive. Counterparts is without a doubt the best sounding album of any in Rush's catalogue; the only one that comes close to touching it in terms of production is Snakes & Arrows.    This album is guitar driven and aggressive much of the time while still leaving room for acoustic guitar (Nobody's Hero), beautiful ambient guitar parts (The Speed Of Love, Everyday Glory), and what I consider one of Alex's best solos that nobody ever mentions (Cut To The Chase). While I prefer the edgier bass tones Geddy is using these days, his bass here sounds natural, smooth, and powerful. Love the way it's mixed! Neil's drum parts on this album have continued his transition from the progressive 70's and flashy 80's to the groove oriented style he has adopted today. But don't let his playing fool you; there are still some very difficult drum parts on this album as can be witnessed when fans try to cover songs like \\"Leave That Thing Alone\\".    Counterparts may not please some hardcore progressive fans who want to hear 2112 forever, but this \\"new\\" Rush focuses less on individual prowess and instead chooses to focus on writing great songs as a band.    One of my favorite albums, and be sure to go back and listen to the solo for \\"Cut To The Chase\\". Simply awesome.
B002UXRH10|5.0|What can I say? Rihanna, has had her ups, and downs this year, but she is back better than ever. This album is better than I expected it to be. This album has a mix of stuff, for everyone to enjoy. Rihanna is a great singer, I think she could sing anything, and it would be great. Rihanna is very talented. Rated R is somewhere, where she needed to go with her music career, I think it was a great decision. I really enjoy, Stupid In Love, Rockstar 101, I think this song is one of her best to date, it has that edge, I really enjoy that. Wait Your Turn, also has an edge, which is great. Cold Case Love is a very emotional song. The Last Song is also amazing. This album is one of my favorites of 2009.

I can't wait to try to make some iskiate haha.    (and maybe one day do a few ultramarathons. >=D)
B002HWRYJE|3.0|Typical of hollywood in these times. Special effects and mediocre acting. Once again it is shown that you cannot remake a legendary IP. When will hollywood do something original?

B001TH8UUA|5.0|I'll leave the techno-babble to other reviewers.    Suffice it to say that this AmazonBasics HDMI Cable works perfectly with my Blu Ray and HD TV.  Not only that, but at a significantly lower price than those so-called premium cables.      Excellent deal.  Excellent price.  Basically a no-brainer.
B001CD6FKS|1.0|I disagree that this is a great film OR a technical feast for anyone except CGI fans. This reviewer is not one of those.<br />Of course movies aren't real, but some realism is expected unless it's a completely animated film. CGI effects look like a GAME rather than quality filmmaking, and that's what &#34;Speed Racer&#34; really is....a classic tv show repackaged as a two-hour arcade game.<br /><br />The frail storyline just isn't enough to hold interest for the duration of this film, especially for fans of the original. The talents of the fine cast, including John Goodman and Susan Sarandon, are completely wasted. Why wasn't Moms' character updated for the 21st century?<br /><br />Don't recommend this to anyone but CGI fans and very young kids. Let's hope another director gets it right.

0060989157|5.0|Neil Strauss does an excellent job of drawing out detailed stories with the feel, emotion and passion of Motley Crue. This should be mandatory reading for any young rock band who is about to hit the road. This could be YOU! You end up loving the Crue more or wanting to smack them for plain stupidity and arrogance. He shows the frustration of Mick Mars, the permanent chips on the shoulders of Nikki Sixx, and Vince Neil, and the somewhat charmed but challenged life of the groups most talented member, Tommy Lee. Worth the read if you wanted to know what it was like to be a rockstar in the 80's.

B000JLSLZQ|1.0|DON'T BUY THIS DVD! The video and audio is inferior and should not be considered \\"Blu-Ray.\\" I am so disappointed, since the sound of this should have been truly spectacular, but I guess you get what you pay for (it's half the price of other Blu-Ray films).  Amazon charged me shipping costs to return this junk, so once again, consumers pay the price for believing in their marketing hype.  Disappointing!
B001U0HBPG|5.0|I can see there are much better writers who've reviewed this film beautifully but I must take part in praising this film.  I was definitely very impressed by this film.  The stunning visual effects, set designs, musical scores, acting and all the multiple aspects of the film just work together so well making the film a true epic and a timeless piece.  The story of a man growing younger not older is told beautifully.  As mentioned in many of the other reviews, the love story between Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett is the central part of the film but the film is more about the case of Benjamin Button and how he deals with life that has dealt him an unusual set of cards.  The film is about life, loss, love, forgiveness and choices.  Brad Pitt was a perfect fit for this role and he plays this character with so much truth.  His performance was truly moving.  It's too bad that the media only focuses on his looks and personal life when, in my opinion, his talent far exceeds all of that.  Cate Blanchett does a fantastic job as well.  And I must reiterate what the other reviewers have mentioned, the fascinating effects of aging - it is truly well done. Without a doubt, a five-star movie.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book, it's the perfect combination of adventure andd romance. Suzanne Collins knows exactly how to make the perfect story with just the right amounts of every important story element. Readers of all ages will enjoy this thrilling adventure filled with suspense, romance, and thrilling moments.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Not a bad effort, but it requires an even greater suspension of disbelief than his other books.  Beyond the usual anti-God stuff which I don`t like, the Noetic science angle is pretty out-there.
B000OVLINI|5.0|Zafon has created a marvelous world of literature replete with rich characters and suspense. The protagonist, Daniel, a young boy growing up in his father's book store, falls in love with a brilliant yet obscure book by a forgotten Catalan author. As with many love affairs, Daniel can't let go, and soon becomes dangerously entangled in the mystery of the the strangely-familiar author's disappearance. As the years pass, the bond between these two seemingly-distant people grows, the parallels become pronounced, until the climax brings everything into sharp focus. Each character evokes emotion from the reader, and I felt invested in the story until the last period.<br /><br />A server at my favorite restaurant recommended this book to me one evening while I was dining alone with my Kindle. By the time my first cocktail arrived I had downloaded the novel and was completely hooked. For the serious reader, that kind of access is totally worth the cost of the device.
076531178X|3.0|Cons:  This book reads like a spin-off on some kind of anime series.  While reading it I just couldn't shrug the cartoon imagery; exaggerated physical features such as large eyes, short unruly hair, elongated limbs, speed lines (MIST in the case of this book) and onomatopoeic, exclamatory typography. Finally, the focus of the writing appears to be on the action sequences, the powers of the characters and very little on the dialog:   -Kelser Nodded  -Vin nodded  -Kelser shrugged      Pros:  The action scenes, the magic system and the Steel Inquisitors (spikes through their eyes) are an interesting twist from the fantasy norm and worth reading about. I would recommend the book on those aspects alone.

B001OQCV24|4.0|2012: Quick Review<br /><br />Grade: B-<br /><br />In director Roland Emmerich's new film 2012, he manages to cram nealy every way possible to destroy our world. John Cusack plays a worried father trying to save his ex-wife and children while the world blows up--whether it be by earthquakes, tsunami's, or mega volcanoes--somehow always behind them. If their's one thing I can't stress enough about 2012, it's that it throws all sense of plausibility out the door. Cusack and co. seem to be either invincable or immpossibly lucky, unlike the other 5 billion that perish in the movie. The special effects are fantastic though, and you can see early on in the movie that the 100 million+ spent on the CGI were worth every penny. Sadly that's the best part about the movie--the script packs every cliche possible into it. And yet it seems we have even more coming our way, even after we've left the theatres--a T.V. series named \\"2013\\", which is about the aftermath of 2012, is already in production.
B002RSDW80|3.0|there are few indicators, more clear and concise, than this movie as a denominator of the disgrace of contemporary treacle being published as \\"writing.\\" meryl streep as julia child is a effervescent reminder of how people used to be: made of strong stuff, clear views, and dedicated to accomplishment...a point made clear by one scene in the movie (will get to that in a moment). meryl streep simply must be given a place of her own in the arena of movies. how great thou art meryl streep? very great, indeed. had hollyweird truly wanted to make a great movie they would simply have made the story of julia child and left amy adams/julie powell in the dustbin where she belongs.     the portions of the movie with amy adams are insufferable, showing as they do, the insufferableness of new yorkers who, steeped in the history of it's-all-about-me psychoanalysis and woody allen belly-button analysis disguised as thought, believe that new yorkers, who have no experiences save for hailing cabs and shopping at bloomies, can nonetheless pretend to write books/movies on experience sieved through the life of those who actually have lived a life: to wit, julia child. new yorkers are shallow, intellectually bereft, and clearly in need of some good ole hands-on living. every new yorkers is seemingly afflicted with michelle oboma syndrome (entitled to the movie star life because they breath air and can walk and talk at the same time). julie powell is the classic insufferable new yorker whose vapidity knows no bounds but the new york publishing world awards this kind of vapidity, refusing to recognize it as a form of sucker fish living whereby ones only ability is to exploit those who have done and lived and achieved.    oh and that scene which shows just how insufferable new yorkers are? in the movie, amy adams/julie powell is oh-so-hurt that julia child doesn't come running to her acclaiming them best buds, but rather declaims amy adams/julie powell in the crisp concise way of ms. child's wielding of her meat cleaver. and why not? the movie clearly shows the endeavor of years julia child racked up in learning her craft and honing her recipes, and amy adams/julie powell wish to simply exploit her. ms. child being no fool, doesn't appreciate such exploitation. new york publishing has no shame.     please, begging here really. stop the onslaught of books by insufferably self-annointing new york \\"authors\\". julie powell has, as is so common these days, been annointed with a book contract on the basis of sixth grade writing and an ability to serve up treacle as nutrition, which much like a twinkie simply can't sustain for more than a wee bit (not to malign the venerable twinkie which compared to julie powell is a medieval feast).    the parts of the movie with meryl streep are so wonderful as to be sheer. fabulous joy. how lucky we are that she is an american and that we can claim her as our own. homegrown. all praise the streep.

B00008OWZC|5.0|The first time I listened to Rock and Roll, (on disc 2,) I had my headphones on - (more like bloody great ear muffs, actually!) It nearly blew me away! I must have listened to that track about six times straight, before I moved on to Moby Dick. Then I had to listen to Moby Dick at least twice, just to hear that cataclysmic sound of John Bonham on the drums one more time!    This album makes the Song Remains the Same seem somewhat monolithic and plodding. (And I really like The Song Remains the Same... Well, I always did, until I heard this!!)    Aside from Led Zep at their rawest, rocking best, there are also some really wonderful acoustic guitar passages that just fill-out the performance nicely and provide some lovely breathing space between all the hard rocking electric guitar riffs and John Bonham's drums. Instead of a pounding dentist's drill, the audience is really ready for the rock when it hits.    Complete with bum notes, slightly off-tune guitars, feedback and overheated valve distortion - (not to mention a couple of occasions when Robert Plant's voice completely cracks!) - this is just wonderfully raw and exciting. Led Zep at their live-performing best! I could listen to this album all day and every day, if I had the chance - and if my neighbors would put up with it!
0156421178|4.0|This first-hand account of Orwell's time fighting in the Spanish Civil War is a good primary source in its own right, if approached with caution, but also givens some vivid insight in to why he approached his later writings the way he did.  Enjoyable read most of the time, but a bit heavy on philosophy in some parts.
B001EO748M|2.0|I'd love to say how much I enjoyed season 2 but after replacing it with a 2nd set of discs I still cannot get past the first episode as it seems to have some protection that won't allow it to play on my DVD player.  Same problem as the first set I purchsed, so I know it's not just operator error. I watch all sorts of DVD's and think this protection stuff has gone too far to actually block veiwing. So now I have to wait for a new player to see Jonathan-Ryes Meyes get and kill the love of his life and move on to more wives.  The first episode of season 2 was as wonderful as the first season so I am waiting with baited breath, and trying not to be too seriously annoyed at the manufactuer.

B001NEK2GE|4.0|The unit is well built and the macros are easy to set up. I have longer fingers and after a solid month of gaming with it a couple hours a day tyipcally sometimes as many as 5 or 6 it still feels awkward.  Part of this is do to its size and my need to place it on a keyboard tray vs. having a flat desk with more room, the other part is its ergonomics.  I did have a problem where it would suddenly switch to the default keybinds for no apparent reason.  It acted up for a week or so and seems to have resolved itself.  Weird?  Other then that I think its a solid option to put more keys in reach then a standard qwerty keyboard.  EDIT:  Software updates have fixed all the software issues.  With time I have become very comfortable with it and have bought a second for when im on the road with my laptop.  COuldnt imagine gaming with out it.

Recommended for anyone that struggles to grasp science and especially young people.   Many people that watch this will be the choir.

1421532255|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. If you have seen the third Death Note film, you should know that this book is different than the movie, which can leave with a lot of the element of surprise.     The Thai boy is missing and Near is himself as N in the story, and the adventures lead with only L and the girl Maki. There's also the FBI agent Suruga. Like in the movie, we see a side of L that is surprising but sweet and concerning. I really loved the way in which they bonded with each other and it makes us think that they became good friends, especially in the moments where they hold hands for reassurance and L telling her that he would protect her. Since you know, she has been infected with the virus that her late father had smuggled into Japan, and the bad guys are after her and to try to obtain the antidote for the virus. L and Maki keep on trying every possible way to evade the villains to not track them down since they have a computer genius with them. Both of them made it on time to a viral expert who had worked with Maki's father in the past and asking for his help in making the antidote which he reluctantly agrees. The professor has a different name than in the movie. There was a scene in which L was too late when Maki decided to hand herself in to the bad people especially Dr. Kujo. She was taken away and when L couldn't catch up after fighting with the lady with the literally killing personality, he let out his anger and despair, this agony being strange to him. But the ending was a good one.    Here's another thing, there's a scene in which L is dressed up in a bear suit. XD

Even the new one from Kiss sounds nothing like a Disturbed or Godsmack,but is not just like a time warp back to the 70s.
B00007GZR5|4.0|First of all let me say that this movie is HARD to watch. It starts out with tragedy and takes a very long time to swoop out of it - in the end it is an uplifting movie, and amazingly crafted both visually and philosophically - but for the majority of the movie it grips you hard by your emotional core and doesn't let go.  The visual style is incredible, the special effects way ahead of their time, and a take on both cinematic presentation and the afterlife unlike any I've ever seen before.    It can be at times a little heavy-handed and overly serious, but with both incredibly strong performances across the board and a deeply compelling story. This movie definitely goes high on my list as a little-known must see movie.
B002ECJZ76|4.0|I wasn't sure how to classify this film. On the one hand, it's more imaginative than the usual holiday fare, and the production values are good.<br /><br />On the other hand, I would have no idea this film was supposed to be set in Finland from watching it. The town the young protagonist, Nicholas, lives in looks like a ranch in Texas. The Dickensian-like master who adopts the boy is Russian, and everyone wears pilgrim hats. These are things that make you go \\"hmmm\\".<br /><br />However, the story is heart-warming. The breakout character is the Russian carpenter who takes charge of the boy. At times the Russian reminds me of Hagrid. Nicholas is a sympathetic character who becomes obsessed with making toys for the children in his fishing village. Although the film treads familiar territory explored by THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF SANTA CLAUS [[ASIN:B002VA5A0M Life And Adventures Of Santa Claus/Nestor The Christmas Donkey (Double Feature)]], SANTA CLAUS THE MOVIE (also features a sleigh accident that sets Santa's destiny in motion), [[ASIN:B000A2XC1C Santa Claus - The Movie (20th Anniversary Edition)]] and SANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN, the story is fresh and there's a sense of wonder.

B0009U55SI|5.0|Now over a half-century old - this Reiner led Chicago Symphony performance of the Mahler Symphony No. 4 was made at the beginning of Decmeber 1958 - we're now treated to a revisit to the original work in the high end SACD format. Reiner was a past master in the works of Richard Strauss, (See for example his shattering recordings of opera excerpts - [[ASIN:B0009U55S8 Richard Strauss: Scenes from Salome & Elektra [Hybrid SACD]]] so it's a treat to hear Reiner's approach to Strauss's musical peer in probably the most accessible of the Mahler symphonies. Instrumental balances are very nicely judged, order is maintained in the most tumultuous sections, and much of the glamorous sound of the Chicago solo players emerges. Soprano Lisa della Casa does not let the side down in the last movement, and I thought Reiner did justice to most of the score, struggling only a bit when it came to clarifying the profoundly elegaic Andante. People often spoke of the Chicago Symphony under Reiner as the symphonic version of a fine wine - and the orchestra certainly does call up the height of luxury and distinction. While I cannot quite mark this down as an unforgettable performance, it IS an unforgettable opportunity to hear the spectacular Chicago Symphony of that Golden Era under agreat Straussian, Reiner, in such an excellently played and recorded historic performance of a Mahler symphony.<br /><br />The much ballyhooed SACD sound definitely catches ones attention, with greater detailing and less of the glare heard in a previous version. Notes claim the original tapes were never subjected to any equalization, and I certainly am not going to argue. To my ear RCA made even better and more successful recordings of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra around this time. (See the above) In a couple moments of the Mahler the metal percussion instruments ting out far too harshly.<br /><br />However, at this price Mahler buffs who like to compare different versions should feel free to indulge their fandom!<br /><br />Note: For some reason Amazon has crossed over reviews of another modern performance of the Mahler with this reissue under Reiner and Chicago.

B002JCSWUW|5.0|It takes a true leader to understand and empathize with a former enemy.  When Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) took power in South Africa, he didn't change the name of the national rugby team.  Instead, he embraced them and encouraged their captain, Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon), to win the 1996 World Cup.      A truly daring move, which his own people initially opposed. But, Mandela understood the pride of the nation and managed with this gracious gesture to bring the people together.      Director Clint Eastwood did his usual amazing job with \\"Invictus.\\" A fellow audience member who recently returned from a visit to South Africa was amazed at how accurately Mandela's cell was depicted.  In addition, both Freeman and Damon did some of their finest work as former enemies brought together to unite a nation.  This is an inspiring performance and one that I predict will garner more than one Academy Award nomination.     Rebecca Kyle, December 2009
B002C6A6N6|3.0|I love the series itself, no question about that. But every single episode at one point during it the voices and the picture are a second or so off. Sometimes, 2 seconds off. Which can be very distracting, and disappointing.
0756405890|5.0|Kvothe is the main character and we find him running a small inn located in a village.  He was using the name Kote.  There is trouble with a spiderlike creature that the locals believe to be a demon.  They destroyed the creature and bury it.  Later we find Kvothe out in the dark by himself.  He lures five more creatures out and destroys them, not telling the locals.  We don't know who this innkeeper is.  From there a man called the Chronicler arrives and wants to know Kvothe's story.  The story then jumps back to when Kvothe was a boy and is told in first person by Kvothe himself.  It takes us through a happy boyhood with a traveling troupe and disaster.  We learn of Kvothe's experience with some beings called The Chandrian, and he becomes obsessed with them.  He takes us through his teen years and leaves us wondering if he is going to make it through the University or if his feud with a noble's son, Ambrose, will ruin him.  The book ends back in the inn and leaving the reader enthralled and wanting more.  The descriptions are vivid, letting the reader smell the wood and dust of the inn, the smoke from the fire, feel tension between rivals, and cheer for the love of a young man who does not know the first thing about courting a lady.  The Name of the Wind is at the top of my list of favorite books.  It is a great read and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the fantasy genre.

B002PQ7JQK|4.0|You can read my formal review at dvdivas.net<br /><br />Depending on when you purchase this the individual sets MAY be a better deal (as of 12/09 they are about $24 less)<br /><br />This is for the Blu-ray three season set. Many folks are rating this based on THE PRICE (that's not what the star sysem is for folks--it's for the overall quality of the sets)my rating is based on the quality of the sets, their packaging and the original episodes themselves NOT THE PRICE.<br /><br />In a nutshell: The show looks terrific and you can toggle between the original visual effects and the new ones with ease most of the time. The writing for the first two seasons was top notch with the third very much a hit-or-miss affair. The show looks stellar with new digitally prepared &#34;prints&#34; that have been cleaned up, color corrected and had damage repaired.<br /><br />Extras are virtually identical to the last DVD set which also had the new visuals but we also get 3 new &#34;Trek&#34; extras (for all three seasons) Billy Blackburn's behind-the-scenes footage. This color footage was shot on location but without sound which gives us a unique look behind the production of the show. Ideally CBS/Paramount would have incorporated these into a new featurette with narration by Blackburn, Nimoy, Shatner and others discussing production for the various episodes but they are nice to have here with Blackburn's memories of working on the show.<br /><br />Included is the original unaired alternate pilot for &#34;Where No Man Has Gone Before&#34; which keeps the original visual effects intact as well as alterned music and the edit is slightly different compared to the aired version. &#34;The Cage&#34; is included with both the &#34;restored&#34; color version as well as the black and white version that has come with all the previous sets BUT it is NOT in HD (I suspect the source material may only be SD videotape) it does, however, feature Roddenberry's original introduction.<br /><br />We also get two Comicon 2009 featurettes (one hosted by David Gerrold writer of &#34;The Trouble with Tribbles&#34; and &#34;The Cloud Minders&#34; and an award winning novelist)as new featurettes on the third season set.<br /><br />There are no additional discs or special features if you buy this boxed set of three vs. the individual titles.<br /><br />For those who want to know the case for the third season is slightly thinner than the first two.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Compare the price of the three seasons to the individual seasons before buying because there isn't anything else of value included here beyond what are on the individual sets.<br /><br />CBS/Paramount has added a couple of special features here unique to each set but not every single special feature on the previous boxed sets appear here either (although most do).

B002I9Z89Y|5.0|For any Star Trek fan, these re-fx'd blu-ray editions of the original series are must-haves.  The imaginative stories, inspired writing, and wonderful characters of the original series finally have the backdrops and special effects they deserve.  While some of the acting is dated, the new fx put these inspirational stories near the top of any sci-fi fans list.  I was stunned seeing some of the old episodes \\"re-envisioned\\" - very well done!  If you are, or know, someone who likes \\"Star Trek,\\" and you have a blu-ray/hi-def TV set-up, this is definitely something that will be cherished.
0307593525|5.0|Like the famous Julie of \\"Julie and Julia\\", a lot of us aspiring amateur cooks tried to work through this book in the 70's. We made a lot of the recipes, including a memorable \\"Dacquoise\\" meringue and praline cake for grad school parties. (We eked out a seminar dinner budget to cover the speaker and two or three guests at a restaurant and turned it into dinner for 30 or so by cooking at a faculty member's house. This was our main cookbook for many of those dinners.)<br /><br />The basics on vegetables are here--maybe a bit plain by today's standards, or sometimes overly complicated (who is going to fight with an artichoke or make a moussaka a la turque steamed in a lining of eggplant skin in a timbale mould) but most of the recipes are well worth the effort.<br /><br />Book One has main dishes and a few desserts, soups, of course and vegetables. Book Two has more ambitious baking (the infamous Dacquoise) and even baguettes, which still don't come out quite right as American flour has a different ash content and American ovens don't produce steam like professional ovens. The pastry section is particularly good in both; you can learn to make a pate sable or a kind of sugar-cookie like crust that is dead useful for tarts. I've also used the Creme Bavaroise many a time; a lot of work, beating gelatin, cream and carefully unmolding what looks like a simple mousse in a decorative ring mould but is a very elegant dessert that serves quite a few, especially sliced, and plated with fresh berries and a drizzle of sauce. It adapts to many flavors (passion fruit, strawberry, chocolate, mocha) and is one of my favorite classics that you just don't see anymore. The Reine de Saba cake (chocolate almond, under-baked in the center and with a ganache glaze) is equally elegant and again, serves a number of people when sliced and plated elegantly.<br /><br />This book has the only French Onion Soup recipe I really like. A lot of work (you have to peel and slice a hellacious pile of onions, oh the tears) and when I had this book the first time, there were NO food processors. Even so, with the food processor, it takes a lot of time to cook down and brown those onions and you need REALLY good broth but the result is by far the best onion soup there is. Just writing about it makes me want to go slice onions this very minute.<br /><br />I can't imagine being without these books, and the packaging is nice, as the originals were two different sized volumes and sit kind of funny on the shelf.<br /><br />I suppose I should mention that even if you aren't going to make most of these dishes (who can find veal these days?) the book is excellent reading on culinary arts.when I had this book the first time, there were NO food processors.

B002RSDW80|3.0|The movie, based upon a young New Yawk woman's blog, has some fine acting, nice emotional moments and fluid editing between a period set in 1949 and 2002.  The acting is quite good.  Meryl Streep seems to be an enormously talented chameleon in her acting - she seems taller in the film, probably with lifts, but has the tall woman's physical movement down pat as the ungainly Julia Child.  Stanley Tucci is usually very good.  Amy Adams plays the vulnerable young woman who works at a 9/11 Recovery center.  Here's where her boss says, \\"Hey I'd fire you if I was a Republican but I'm not a schmuck.\\"  There are also reference to McCarthy and Julia's father voting as a Republican to set the Left-wing agenda in motion.  Gratuitious bashing distracts from otherwise good entertainment.  If you want to vote with your dollars against the nuts, then don't buy but rent.
B002NPY7E0|4.0|Set in the mid-1950s, sleazy private investigator Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is hired by mysterious Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) to find a singer who owes him money. Enticed by a $5000 retainer, Angel's search leads him to a hospital which covered up the singer's release years ago, and then to New Orleans and bayou country where Angel's probe leads to voodoo worshipers and a trail of brutal ritualistic killings. Along the way, Angel manages a brief but raw encounter with the singer's young, sexy daughter played by Lisa Bonet.     The movie is entertaining to watch if you don't mind a little brutality and gore now and then, and has an interesting plot twist of deja vu and self-discovery. I did think that the glowing, piercing eyeball display on several characters at the end was silly and unnecessary, since an assoociation with the darker side of things had already been established. While De Niro's character appears mostly at the beginning and end, Rourke carries the film and gives the movie it's vitality. Charlotte Rampling also appears in a minor role.    The blu-ray transfer is mosly excellent but with typical grain in the blue/grey skies. Special features include comments by Rourke and director Alan Parker.    Tidbits: Following this 1987 film, Rourke moved on to do the sleazy Barfly with Faye Dunaway. Alan Parker, who had previously directed Midnight Express, completed the successful Mississippi Burning the following year.
B00005V9IL|5.0|With all due respect to The Titanic, which is also a masterpiece, James Cameron's \\"The Abyss\\" remains, more than twenty-years after its release, the pre-eminent water-based film.<br /><br />To the professional reviewer who complained about the plodding pace of this film I would ask \\"just exactly what film were you WATCHING?\\"  The Abyss is fleshed out with intriguing character development and scenes that make you identify with and care about what happens, but these scenes hang on a skeleton of many of the most scintillating and hair-raising set-pieces ever filmed.<br /><br />When the original theatrical release of this movie occurred in 1989, I was a submariner on the U.S.S. Tennessee, an Ohio-class submarine like the U.S.S. Montana, the fictional submarine that encounters some unknown deep-sea disturbance before sinking in a scene that was horrifyingly realistic to myself and my shipmates who went from the darkened theatre back to the Tennessee.  Except for a water-tight door outside of the ship's control center, the submarine depicted in the film was eerily realistic.  The scene where submariners know they are losing the ship, as well as their own lives, was harrowing in the extreme.<br /><br />Ed Harris plays Bud Brigman, the leader of an underwater oil-drilling rig that is closest to the sunken Montana.  Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio plays Lindsey, Bud's estranged wife and the designer of the deep sea rig.  Michael Biehn plays LT Coffey, the leader of the Seal Team the Navy sends down to Bud's rig to lead a search and rescue mission of the submarine.<br /><br />A masterful supporting cast rounds out the all-too-human drama taking place far under the water.  Absolutely amazing underwater scenes keep you on the edge of your seat as you learn that the Seal team has secret orders to secure a nuclear warhead from the submarine to destroy anything the Soviets may try to salvage from the wreckage and the undersea team learns a little at a time that they are not alone.<br /><br />A word must be provided contrasting the Special Edition to the original theatrical version.  Some \\"special edition\\" movies simply pad the running time with scenes that were wisely cut from the version that is released.  The Abyss special edition adds almost 30 minutes that completely change the tone of the original.  The ending, previously weak to the point of near ridicule as a Deux-ex-machina is introduced, now resonates in a way that makes you think \\"every single human being on the planet should watch this.\\"<br /><br />I have deliberately tried to avoid spoilers, but if you're a human being... you should watch The Abyss Special Edition.<br /><br />Peaceing the Special Edition to the original theatrical version.

B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I'm not going to nit-pick like a critic and just express my own opinion of this movie - I loved it! I grew up on ABBA's music as my parents were fans and remember singing and dancing to \\"Dancing Queen\\" when I was seven (such memories!). I have loved ABBA ever since, and it was only recently that I actually got to watch the movie (sadly, on DVD, as I missed it during its theater run). Though the actors do not remotely resemble (nor sing like) the singers of ABBA, they more than make up for it with genuine chemistry and camaraderie. A viewer can tell these actors had great fun during the production of this musical/movie and their fun is incredibly infectious! I sang out loud and even danced to the old, familiar, classic songs, and had so much fun! The main cast is made up of famous actors - the incomparable Meryl Streep (who really showcases her beautiful singing voice here), the svelte Christine Baranski, and Julie Walters (I remember her most from her role as Mrs Weasley in the Harry Potter movie franchise), Pierce Brosnan (yes, he does not exactly have a great singing voice, but who cares???), Colin Firth (whose performance as Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice left an indelible impression on me), Stellan Skarsgaard, and the two young and talented actors, Amanda Seyfried as Sophie, and Dominic Cooper as her fiance, Sky (the pair are a real-life couple and reportedly began dating on the set of the movie).<br /><br />The story begins with 20-year-old Sophie Sheridan who discovers that any one of three men (Brosnan, Firth, or Skarsgaard) could be her father. Wishing to have her father (Sophie was raised by her mother,Donna played by Meryl Streep) walk her down the aisle at her wedding to Sky (Dominic Cooper), Sophie invites all three men to her wedding. The clueless Donna invites her two former backup singers to the wedding (Baranski and Walters), and when she sees the three men from her past, all hell breaks loose, and so does the music! The plot is quite thin, and the characters are not explored in-depth here - but the focal point of the movie is the music. The plot revolves around the music, and the lively dance numbers showcase great choreography. The fashion is reminiscent of ABBA's heyday and the costumes are in a riot of colors - all in all, pure rip-roaring fun!<br /><br />This is a fun movie that brings back nostalgic memories. I will be adding this to my DVD collection.Someday, I hope to watch the Broadway musical.ers are not explored in-depth here - but the focal point of the movie is the music.

0061053147|5.0|I needed to write an essay about a movie and I selected \\"Blade Runner\\" because I wanted to learn more about it.  The essay also required research resources for which I purchased this book.  It turned out to be a valuable source of information about the movie and behind the scene work.  I recommend it for any filmmaker who is seriously studying movies.  This is a classical masterpiece movie and the book helps explain why.
B001AIRUP4|5.0|The movie is one of my all time favorites to watch with my Daughters during the Holidays. On Blu-Ray it was Awesome. Having seen the movie on DVD first then on Blu ray, I was able to see details that was not noticeable before. Everything seemed so much more richer, the stars popped out of the scene in a way that the dvd version couldn't. It is a must see on Blu-Ray.
0143034901|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book despite not knowing whether I would like it at all.  It's not the sort of book that I would normally choose, but it was a book club selection so I got to read it nonetheless.  As it turned out I read it in two and a half days and got very frustrated when I had to put it down to get other things done.  The mystery of it keeps you intrigued throughout the book.<br />Some fellow members of my book club felt the style was a bit flowery, but I enjoyed that myself.<br />My only critique is that it was a bit too well wrapped up in the end; while on the one hand I liked having all the loose ends tied up, it also made it a bit too tidy.

B002XHN776|5.0|This is War is the long awaited new album from 30 Seconds to Mars.  I did not think it could get better than A Beautiful Lie, but the band has outdone themselves again.  There is an edge to the new sound.  You can find songs on this album for your every mood.  Music to pump you up would be This Is War and Vox Populi.  A more mello sound can be found in Hurricane and Closer to the Edge.  There are many examples of the band's use of vocals strait from their fans.  This makes this album truly unique.  I would recommend this to any listener that enjoys rock.  With This Is War you can not go wrong.
0684824906|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Goodwin uses sources around the President and cabinet to paint a rich picture of the people and how they worked through the problems they faced. This book offers more than a view of history, it has gems of Lincoln's brilliant management of a very independent and contentious cabinet. Mr. Lincoln and this book have lessons to teach about working with and getting the most from teams of smart people.
0553579908|4.0|With the advent of the HBO series, the books have become a hot item for readers and curious non-readers alike.  Most notably, individuals want to know and experience the differences between the series and the books, but also to gain more knowledge about the characters and the land in which they live.  Having read this book well before the TV series, and having read it again after watching the show, it is interesting to see the liberties HBO took and what they kept the same.  As per most of my reviews, the book is, of course, better.<br /><br />Robert Baratheon is dead, and Joffrey Baratheon (most refer to him as Joffrey Lannister since he has no Baratheon blood in him) sits the Iron Throne with his Queen Regent mother, Cersei, presiding.  The Hand of the King, Eddard Stark, is also dead from beheading decreed by the Lannisters, and war is upon the Seven Kingdoms.  Robb Stark claims to be the King of the North, Renly and Stannis Baratheon both battle each other and Joffrey for the Iron Throne, Lord Tywin fights for he Lannisters cause, and Daenerys Targaryen is left to try to figure out what to do amongst the Dothraki now that her Khal is, also, dead.  Having killed off some of the best characters, this book is strangely lacking for people to like.  The running winners is often Jon Snow, Arya Stark, and Tyrion Lannister just because they are the outsiders, Daenerys as well.<br /><br />The book focuses on the clash between the kings, hence the title, but there are hardly any battles.  This also makes it difficult to plod through the book.  Thankfully, Martin is a fantastic writer and he is able to keep and hold interest quite a deal.  There is also a lot more misdirection to keep the reader on the edge of their seats and continually entranced in reading.  For example, magic makes a bigger to-do in this book, and curiosity is piqued as to what lies beyond the infamous ice Wall at the northernmost reaches of the kingdoms.  There is definitely a goal in this second book of the series to reaffirm and to help the readers realize the depth and complexity of the characters left to be complex.  This will help as the series progresses.<br /><br />Overall, a good read, albeit slow, and definitely necessary for the series.  It does, however, pale in comparison to the first book and even ends on a bit of a low note.of the series to reaffirm and to help the readers realize the depth and complexity of the characters left to be complex.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|As a life-long Trekkie, starting with TOS(the original series to non-Trekkies) my anticipation for this movie was tinged with apprehension. With all new actors, director,etc. the possibility of messing up the whole idea of Star Trek and the relationship between the main characters seemed a real liklihood. I was immensely pleased that did not happen. The young actors playing Kirk, Spock, and McCoy nailed the personalities of their characters. I enjoyed this movie tremendously, seeing it first at the theater,then watching it again on the DVD. The funny outtakes and commentary on the Dvd are a bonus. Looking forward to the next ST movie!
0385504225|2.0|Basically a rehash of the Da Vinci Code, but not nearly as good. Much in this book struck me as preposterous. The characters recover from terrible situations, and even mutilations, in a matter of minutes. The last 50 pages of the book are so slow I seriously considered not reading them. The only good thing is since I checked it out from the library I have no financial pain.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Whoops! I think Lucas missed the boat here.  By the time higher market penetration hits, the disc price will be down to an average of $15. Had he released it last Christmas, he could've sold the complete Star Wars compendium including all six of the original films with special features and the like (including original and revised versions of the films) plus Clone Wars. This set would probably have run somewhere in the neighborhood of $200 last year.  This year it would probably be on sale at no more than $150. Next year it'll be a Black Friday Door Buster for $49.99!    Had he released it last year, it would've driven sales of BD players last year, he would've sold somewhere in the neighborhood of 1Million copies - a net profit to him somewhere in the neighborhood of $40 million dollars... now who couldn't use an extra 40 mil during the Holidays?  This year he would sell an additional 3 million copies.  Probably by the time he releases it, BD will be no more.  That'll just frost my hide!    LUCAS - if you read this. I've already paid you about $300 of my hard earned coin buying all of the different VHS/DVD versions of the films. Get it together... I want to give you more of my money!

B001DUJNGS|1.0|I got this CD for something to listen to on the way home from my girlfriend's house (a couple hours away).  It wasn't too bad... a little repetitive, perhaps, but not as bad as Moby.  I would rate the music a solid 3.  Unfortunately, a couple days after I got home, I decided to play it on my computer (which serves as the \\"preamp\\" for my sound system, among other things).  Well, to make a long story short, this CD, like nearly every other music CD I have bought in the last couple of years, immediately begins to execute (or try to execute) all sorts of crap-ware.  I suppose I just wasn't in the mood for that sort of garbage, so I calmly removed the CD, replaced it into its jewel case, held it over the trash can, and snapped it into a couple dozen pieces.  After all, life is too short to waste any portion of it struggling to listen to mediocre music.  I know I already paid for it.  I also know that within five minutes I could be listening to it in Windows or that I could have just booted into Linux and listened to it without a hitch.  It's just the principle, you know.  I paid the money, so I don't want to jump through hoops to listen to the freakin CD.  The people that pirate the music (and yes, EMI, it is that easy) don't have to put up with crap-ware, so why make the people who actually buy it put up with it?  How likely do you think it is that I will ever actually buy another CD from EMI?  Exactly.  Oh well, back to work. By the way, FYI, if you put CDs back in the jewel case first, they seem to crumble like crackers when snapped.

B001684L0A|4.0|This is a sidenote for this series based on what I have learned on the founding fathers.    This series probably does the best it can of making the founding fathers human, and 200 years ago people weren't as \\"pretty\\" as people are now.  So yes, Washington did hold a grudge against Jefferson and never spoke to him again.  Hamilton really was an irrate person who I believe was shot and killed in a duel.      Lastly, if you really believe that the founding fathers had Christian intentions for forming a separate government, then you haven't learned the most important thing about how most decisions are made, which is \\"How did money effect this decision?\\"    Part of the founding fathers were not Christian, though they did go to church.  Parts of them did believe that most people were idiots.  Some were political scholars, which is rare today.  They had good ideas about governments in general, and that's why they could develop a pretty effective government on the second try, basing most of their ideas on the Virginia plan, which was the work of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, the political scholars.      You really think this country is about some glorified version of history that you learn in elementary school?  There are plenty of documents that disprove that, though if you have doubts then I suggest you become a Historian and do the work that they have done.
B002MJV75O|5.0|I absolutely love the series, so glad I bought it. Only compliant I have is more than half the cds have pretty big scratches on them and some of the scratches interfere with playing the cd and it skips and or doesn't read the cd so I have to take it out, clean it and put it back in. I have gotten all of them to work again by doing that but for the money I paid for it and for the set being brand new I don't understand how the CDs have scratches in them. Otherwise, great series!!

The innocense from the beginning of man space flight and it's maturation by the early 1990's as seen by an insider is very exciting.  And it leaves us as readers not affected so much by the mistakes or later the shuttle disasters. Instead we see people using slide rulers (yes the nuns taught us to use them even though caculators were already cheap) and low tech equipment (from our standards of today) and ask ourselves how did they get so much right!  They just don't make these kind of people anymore.<br /><br />One other note - gosh damn - isn't it nice to actually read someone and have them \\"talk\\" like most of us talk.  No ghostwritting here.  Just plain,understandable sentences and paragraphs.<br /><br />And for that the critics panned the book.<br /><br />As Al Swearengen of HBO's \\"Deadwood\\" asks the newspaper writer of the town \\"is it your duty to inform your readers or make them feel stupid\\".  This is one reader that thinks that less and simple is more.
B001UE27X8|5.0|Having been a fan of Bill Evans for ever, when I later \\"discovered\\" the marvel that is Tony Bennett, it was an obvious move for me to pick up [[ASIN:B000J233MG The Tony Bennett/Bill Evans Album]]. As my review of that work said, Tony and Bill have a certain chemistry that magically comes to life when Tony's phrasing and subtle emotional projections are overlaid on Evans' lucid, iridescent harmonies and voicings. I mean, I really didn't want it to be over, so when I started thinking about getting the second TB&BE recording, this compilation was an easy, economical choice. I have not been disappointed. Comprising two CD's, one containing the released material from the two recordings, and the other containing the un-released second (or \\"bad\\" first) takes, this set really gives the listener a lot to compare, contrast, and just enjoy. In fact, I was a little surprised at how different the outtakes sound compared to the released songs, especially the released songs that I've come to know so well through repeated listenings. Which is not to say that any of the unreleased material is of inferior quality. I just don't believe there is any song that Tony and Bill couldn't make sound good. But what is remarkable in the unreleased material is that what sounds different does not sound quite as good as what eventually made it to the albums. It's hard to explain, but as an informed listener, I was able to pick up on the subtle nuances that were lost in some takes and showed through in others. It's really remarkable to listen to the recordings in this fashion, and it gave me an even greater appreciation of what Bennett and Evans achieved in their heyday. I would say any fan of vocal jazz, and any fan of Bill Evans, would do well to add this compilation to their collection. Casual jazz fans will probably became Bennett and Evans fans if they aren't already if they pick this one up. This is jazz mastery that is timeless, ingenious, and moving, and four times the music of any one CD. Who would complain about too much of good - or great - thing?Who would complain about too much of good - or great - thing?
B001AVCFJM|3.0|Gene Roddenberry must be spinning in his grave, this movie is so far out of context with the original Star Trek its just plain wrong, the only explaination is that its an alternate universe where up is down, and an Ensign becomes Captain on his first mission. Chekov joined the crew when Kirk had been Captain for, what 15 years, but not in this upside down universe, he was already on board when Kirk came aboard. They should have just gave the ship and everyone in the movie a different name.
B002R4K6AG|5.0|I just received this as a b-day present and it is a home run! Though somewhat of a novelty it comes across more like sincere. In the immediacy of my current situation I was having a hard time getting in the Christmas spirit, but I look at it this way, if Bob Dylan can do it, anyone can, it worked for me, his cracking gravelly voice makes each note sound like it might be his last..... Oh Little Town of Bethlehem.... this CD is the most successful merge of Santa Clause and the birth of Jesus I can recall. I was never really impacted by the words of most of these songs until now.

0810982862|3.0|I was underwhelmed by much of the stuff in the book.  The fact that it is a skimpy book didn't bother me as much as its content.  There is a usual number of technically well executed images, but lacking  inspiration: less the fault of the artists than Cameron's taste I would assume.  There are some interesting creature and environment concepts, but it's stuff we have seen in countless video games and movies: mechanized suites, propellered ships, space marines...  I was hoping for more exotic images of truly alien lands but not in this book.  I know the film is supposedly filled with amazing night time shots of the planet with glowing plants and aliens but not in the book.    What you do see in the book are endless photo-manipulated Photoshoped imagery which is a great ad for Photoshop as an illustration tool.  One image that somewhat irritated me was a two-page spread of the blue aliens having hunted a larger creature while they were cutting up the hunt.  Well, the image looked familiar to me then I realized that it was actually a well known National Geographics photograph of Pygmies hunting and cutting up an elephant. The aritst seems to have simply manipulated the photo to create the piece.  All fine if just used to show the director ideas, but to give the picture a two-page spread didn't sit well with me.    If you love Art of books, then by all means pick this up.  But this book is certainly not the most awe-inspiring of the bunch.
0761129235|5.0|For years my approach to work and my life is how to achieve the most success in the shortest period of time.  This frequently resulted in set backs from impatience and over expansion (in my business).  It took many years for me to realize that the bigger, better, and faster approach resulted in two steps forward and three steps back, i.e. it actually made me go backwards in the long run.<br /><br />Thinking small, taking small but steady incremental steps is counter intuitive in our present culture of instant gratification but I now fully believe that it is the most solid way to progress in both life and work.  This book explains the small step and incremental principle.  It is easy to read but pack with common sense insights.  The principles laid out in this book will serve as my cornerstone principles in life and work.

0515127485|4.0|This was readable with some interesting information on Stalinist Russia. The prose was serviceable. I learned a couple new words, including \\"verst\\" and \\"taiga\\". The structure, plotting, and characters were professionally and skillfully wrought; I finished the book, was interested. I think it's a book worth reading.<br /><br />I don't think this book rises to the level of some of Harris's novels, like Fatherland, Imperium, or Pompeii.<br /><br />For one thing, I did not get the sense that the author had truly mastered Russian culture and history. Too many of the characters and scenes seemed drawn more from movies than from history. There was very little insight into the Russian language, and except for a few sayings (of which \\"we are born on a clear plain and die in a dark forest\\" was my favorite; or Stalin's \\"gratitude is a dog's disease\\").<br /><br />But with Fatherland, there just seemed to be a more pervasive Germanic sense, or mood, in the book. And in Imperium, I just got the sense the author had learned some Latin, had mastered the details, in a way I did not get with this book. Similarly, Pompeii had so much detail about aqueducts, you could tell there was a huge amount of research that went into it. Frankly, in this book I got the sense the author didn't know Russian. The style was not wedded to the content as tightly as in his other books, it just did not feel \\"Russian\\" in the way that Fatherland felt German or Imperium, Latin. Too much of the effect depended on cinematic set pieces and horror or gore, there was too much profanity, overall just not quite the subtlety of Imperium or  even Pompeii.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, the big weakness in this book is that the conclusion. The earlier plot-lines are either left dangling or are resolved in ways that were not credible, indeed at times the resolutions seemed almost silly.<br /><br />Now the remainder of the review has SPOILERS so do not read more if you don't like them.<br /><br />The image of Stalin's son spouting quotations from his speeches just seemed absurd. It's easy to be absurd in literature - what's hard is to be realistic, to be plausible.<br /><br />The whole sub-plot of the missing pages of the notebook was left dangling. It's also not really clear what will happen to the son.<br /><br />The idea that Kelso would try to destroy the notebook is one I found rather annoying. He's a historian. I hate in movies and novels when characters destroy some valuable artifact they've spent the whole plot seeking. But it's especially annoying here, when it's a historian doing it.es just seemed absurd. It's easy to be absurd in literature - what's hard is to be realistic, to be plausible.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|I will start off with stating that I was NEVER a fan of Star Trek! I had so many friends that followed the series and then consequently the movies but I never had an interest in it. I had a very basic knowledge of the characters or props known for this series but I could not tell you about episode 7, scene 19........yeah I just made that up! So when this movie came up I won't say I was one of the millions that was anxiously waiting to see it! But nonetheless I have always had a weakness for prequels because you do get to find out how characters developed and in this case Iconic characters that have stood the test of time, so I CAN tell you that I was a little curious. The movie was released on the big screen and it came and it went and I never saw it, in spite of so many recommending it! So here comes the home release of it and being a huge fan of special effects and quality sound and the whole business of \\"Blu-Ray\\" I was ready to start reading reviews of this movie as soon as they were available and they were all very favorable. So I decided that I was going to dive in head first and just straight purchase this bad boy!! Well I did and I can tell you the water is more than fine, it is absolutely amazing! The video capture of this movie is spectacular! The sound is ground shaking and crisp, and the story line of the movie was very cool and with my very minimal knowledge of all that is Star Trek, I was able to enjoy the characters that I was somewhat familiar with and most of all I was fascinated with the root of the friendship between Kirk and Spock. It seems like they got all the perfect young actors to fit all the main rolls! All and all the movie was amazing in the Blu-Ray format and I wholeheartedly recommend it for even the non-fans of the genre!! Pick one up, if you are a Blu-ray enthusiast, you need to have it in your collection! And may the force be with you.........told you I didn't really know about this stuff!! LOL  ENJOY!!

0385504225|5.0|Whenever a book is written that \\"supposedly\\" challenges our beliefs, I look forward to reading it. If what we think is what we are, a book that challenges our beliefs will either help us transform and self actualize, or will reaffirm that what we believe is indeed a certainty for us. At any rate... we gain from the author's insight, perspective, ideas, suggestions and knowledge.    So, when The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons were released, I read them, and honestly enjoyed the mystery, the thrill, the suspense and the locations covered by the work of Dan Brown because having visited those cities, I was stunned to realize I had not seen many of the symbols mentioned. We even researched The Last Supper by Leonardo DaVinci and were surprised to find many of the details explained by the author and never had we seen the details as when explained by this amazing writer.    So, it is with great anticipation that I looked forward to reading The Lost Symbol, especially knowing that this book would be written about a city we frequently visit, Washington, D.C. Having just finished reading it, I look forward to our next visit so we can \\"map\\" out the sites mentioned by the book and experience the thrill of discovering it through Dan Brown's eyes.    The Lost Symbol is awesome! With great trepidation every page is turned because the suspense created is simply riveting. Without revealing the plot or attempt to re-write the work, the thoughts that fascinated me and have kept me pondering on the wisdom share are as follows:    - To live in the world without becoming aware of the meaning of the world is like wandering about in a great library without touching the books!  - What if I told you that a thought... any tiny idea that forms in our mind... actually has mass? The obvious implications are, if a thought has mass, then a thought exerts gravity and can pull things toward it... Taking this thought a step further, what happens if many people start focusing on the same thought?- If enough people begin thinking the same thing, then the gravitational force of that thought becomes tangible... and it exerts actual force with the ability to effect our physical world.    The first lines encourage education, reading and seeking knowledge. A truly noble idea. The second and third encourage the people of our planet Earth to share information, to debate ideas, to encourage learning and to \\"think\\" therefore... becoming citizens of a planet that can; for example, finally achieve peace!    Imagine all the people of Earth focusing on one thing, the power of our minds to create, to do good for mankind, to leave a legacy, to transfer knowledge and insight. Imagine humanity realizing the true potential of our brain power to do powerful things rather than seeing ourselves as different and separate from one another.     As you read the book, take the time to research the symbols, to find clips on the locations mentioned, to ponder on the probing thoughts shared by the author. Powerful... and in the end, we walk away with the feeling that there is a better way for our societies to form, through cooperation and the sharing of knowledge and ideas.    Yes, The Lost Symbol provides... HOPE!    If you have not done so, I sincerely encourage you to read The Lost Symbol!

B000PKX2KA|5.0|I was looking for a USB powered GPS receiver to use witn my Asus Netbook [[ASIN:B002DYIXMI ASUS Eee PC 1005HA-PU1X-BK 10.1-Inch Black Netbook - 10.5 Hour Battery Life]]and Microsoft Streets and Trips software.  I didn't buy the Microsoft one at first because I thought my Garmin eTrex would work - but although it is a great field GPS, it doesn't support NMEA codes that Streets and Trips (and other software packages) require.  So, the GlobalSat unit fit the bill.  Easy to install with included drivers and it's high sensitivity antenna even picked up enough satellites from inside the building to get a pretty good fix.  Terrific.  I have yet to use it on a road trip but at least now I'm ready.

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|My family and I went and saw this in 3D in the theater, but we knew we had to buy the disc to add it to our collection.  I try not to spoil the movie plot in my reviews, so this may not be as thorough as some, but sometimes discovering details for yourself is half the fun.    It's a sweet movie... surprising, in some parts... that has character moments everyone in your family can relate to.  It deals with lost love, growing old, being a child, childhood adventure, and family.  If you're a dog lover, you will have something that appeals to you too.    This movie can be heart-breaking, at times.  I know in the theater I misted up in three separate parts, and viewing the DVD at home does not change the pathos of those moments.  Your experience may vary.  As a woman starting the last stretch of the road towards fifty years of age, and the mother of two children, though, there was a lot in this movie I could relate to.    In the end, you are rewarded for all the teary bits, I promise.  I don't know if it's a happy ending, but it is a satisfying one.

1400032717|5.0|I found this book in the library by accident, I love dogs and was intrigued by the book's cover showing an upside down French poodle. My brother is severely austic. I can barely stop reading the story. Unlike the author who said that he is mildly autistic, I can excuse the book for not having the main character express his emotional side. Just writing about the way that people who are autistic may think gives me confidence to think my ideas may be true. I can understand him more through this book. My real person-brother does have intense emotions. When my mother dies and he was living with her, our cat, Happy Days had to be pried from his fingers. This book is a big start for me. I will be ordering Mark Haddon's other books and searching for more books, fiction or not on autism.
0812966066|4.0|It wouldn't be right to say much about the plot of a detective murder mystery. So I won't. The short, non-spoiler synopsis is: Holmes and Watson solve the crime behind the mysterious death of a man with the surname Baskervilles, circumstances being complicated by a curse. The characters were well-developed, descriptions good, plot non-figure-out-able. I'd only take issue with statements that seem true, but turn out to false or vice-versa. Then again, I guess that the way it goes the genre.<br /><br />This being my first Sherlock Holmes story, I was surprised to learn that this particular book is (p vii) \\"the most popular Holmes story and perhaps Doyle's most acclaimed work.\\" Also interesting is the fact that (p vi, vii) Doyle killed off Holmes (in a book published in 1894), but brought him back for this book, published in 1901. Although a helpful explanatory Notes section was provided to clarify some of the terminology, the book was, in general, a short, easy, enjoyable read. I preferred it to The Maltese Falcon by Dashiell Hammett, another author I read recently for the first time. Even better: The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins.
B000ZECQ08|5.0|The magical world finally stands united now that the Dark Lord has made his presence known. Now no one is safe except for those to choose his side. Be it a wizard or muggle Voldemort has his sights set one finally completing his mission, but he must eliminate the chosen one. Harry Potter, is about to enter his sixth year at Hogwarts. This time, besides being closely watched over by the watchful and caring Albus Dumbledore Harry must face a new challenge, being a normal teenaged boy with his thoughts fixated on girls. Friendships and dating is swimming all throughout the corridors at Hogwarts and it's much more complicated than any Quidditch match. Still, Harry must stay focused because he can sense that there is a plot afoot to penetrate the walls of Hogwarts and turn the haven of wizarding youth into a spawning ground for Death Eaters. The questions that need to be answered are who is plotting it, whom are they after and who is working with them on the inside. There are many secrets revealed about Voldemorts past in this chapter, but most importantly this is the point in time when Harry Potter finally makes the choice on what he must do to finally take down his nemesis.<br /><br />There were many mixed reviews about this film, but as a fan who read this book when it was first released this was my favorite installment (Meaning it surpases 'Chamber of Secrets'). What grabbed me the most was this book made things a little lighter after two extremely dark novels. It was a much more human story showing that while there is a classic story of good versus evil in an imaginative world these young witches and wizards are still just ordinary teenagers with ordinary problems. Bringing David Yates back to direct this film was the best choice because in 'Order Of The Phoenix' he brought realism to the characters and deep development within themselves and with one another. Tackling love and heartbreak is a very hard thing to do in a Sci-Fi fantasy film, but Yates nailed it. The story was also very funny as the book was. The characters show fears in the areas on popularity or just manning up to tell a girl how he felt. Tom Felton who has played Draco was finally given a chance to show his acting potential. While there was minimal dialogue until the very end his body language showed true emotional that really worked the crowd. The fact that a boy who has always boasted about being a proud dark wizard can shed tears when he faces his true self was made so believable by Felton. I sure hope that once these films have concluded he is given a chance for more work and many stellar performances.<br /><br /> If you agree with this review then like me this will be a Harry Potter film you will enjoy. We now look forward to the final chapter going Hoarcrux on us to bring us the entire final book page by page.

B000PDYVVG|3.0|Deviated greatly from my reading tendencies to read this book after hearing a 'guilty pleasure' recommendation from NPR. I will know better next time.  Italy and India portions of this book were OK. Indonesia digresses into a smultzy pseudo-harlequin romance. Boo.
0756405890|5.0|I'm sure by now that you've heard all the raves about this book. They are all true. This book is quite possibly the best book I've ever had the pleasure of reading. The writing is what makes this book great. I greatly appreciate the way Rothfuss takes the time to develop his characters, the plot, and his world. He does this as well or better than any author I've ever read. I could go on about how great the book is but I'll stop the praise here and get to the critizism.   Where is the second book.

B002Q4U9YU|5.0|After seeing the movie, 3 times, yes, 3 times, I am still awestruck by the talent, professionalism, dedication to his craft and his utmost graciousness towards his musicians, dancers, singers and superior choreographers, producers, directors and all making this concert happen.  The creativity they all bring blows your mind. It takes ALL THIS to make a concert happen?    When you view this movie you won't care how much you pay for a concert ticket anymore. You understand the blood, sweat and teamwork that is so remarkable.    The director is a genius as is Michael Jackson. The creative team around them are the best of the best. Dancers from all over the world. Musicians like you have never seen or heard.  And Michael, doing his thing as only he can do, bringing magic into the mix.    Everyone seeing this amazing movie will understand why he was loved and why he  was so dedicated to the environment and was a humanitarian.  Loving was his specialty, dancing and singing was his way to get you to listen to the words of his music and what he loved and wanted to change and making us aware of the beauty around us and how to save it and us.

B000A2GREQ|5.0|For casual fans interested in the work of The Police, this is definitely the best place to start. If you could make one criticism of the band, it's that they had some brilliant individual songs, but couldn't always sustain things consistently over an entire album. In contrast, 'Greatest Hits' is uniformally strong, with no flat spots or weak songs in sight.     All of the band's big hits are here: 'Roxanne', 'Can't Stand Losing You', 'Message In A Bottle', 'Walking On The Moon', 'Don't Stand So Close To Me', 'Do Do Do Do...', 'Spirits In The Material World', 'Every Little Thing...', 'King Of Pain', 'Wrapped Around Your Finger', and (obviously) 'Every Breath You Take'. But there are also a couple of fan favourites such as 'So Lonely', 'Invisible Sun' and 'Synchronicity II', which weren't massive hits but have an important place in The Police legacy.     Importantly, the songs are all presented in chronological order, which is significant, as the band developed rapidly from straight reggae-punk anthems to complicated jazz/pop philosophical discourses. My only objection would be that 'Tea In The Sahara' (an album track) could have been left off for 'Secret Journey' (a single), although 'Tea..' does provide a nice closer to the collection.     At 16 tracks, this album is the perfect length; long enough to include a couple of lesser-known but important songs, but not so long as to bog the album down with any filler. It's simply one great song after another, and a perfect place to introduce yourself to one of post-punk's most creative and successful bands.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|Anyone who has seen Greencard or any other movie where the main characters are at odds and forced together, can pretty much figure out the direction of this movie.  That doesn't mean it is fun nonetheless.  Bullock plays a tough New York book editor (Margaret) that has the whole office cringing in fear of her.  Reynolds plays her pandering assistant (Andrew) who will do anything to be promoted to editor and get his book published.    Though Andrew is like a \\"servant\\" around Margaret he lets the rest of the world (the office and his family) how much he hates her.  He even sends broadcast  text messages to the staff, each time Margaret approaches.  Through a bad judgement by Margaret to land an interview overseas, Imigration has revoked her visa (she is a Canadian) and will be deporting her.  Not only that, she will not be able to return to the US for at least a year, which would effectively nix her editior job.    Desperate, she hatches a scheme where she and Andrew are getting married.  She then has to make a lot a concessions to him so he will go along with the plan and convince immigration.  What follows is that Margaret has to travel with Andrew to a family birthday party and Andrew is not who she thought he was.    It takes a while into the movie for some let up to Margaret's \\"Dragon Lady\\" personality.  A lot gets helped along by Andrew's grandmother (Betty White) and mother (Mary Steenburgen) who both put in \\"A\\" performances.  The movie never gets too campy like some of Reynolds prior films, instead the level of humor is about right (maybe along the lines of The Devil Wears Prada).      This is one of the better comedies I have seen this year, a good \\"date\\" flick.

The songs she wrote are wonderful.  \\"Christmas Must Be Something More\\" really gets at the heart of Christmas.  I loved it.  \\"Christmases When You Were Mine\\" is great for someone who had a breakup with someone who is still loved. \\"Santa Baby\\" is the best version I have ever heard.  I actually heard all the words for the first time.  I never knew what \\"deed\\" she was asking for on other versions.  She really did a great job with \\"Last Christmas\\" making it her own. Her rendition of \\"White Christmas\\" and \\"Silent Night\\" were beautifull updated.  What a great CD.  Every song was special like Taylor.  She amazes me with her vocals.

B001P06GX4|5.0|One of the modern classic board games.  This game is very deep, despite the simple concept.  There is a great amount of skill involved.  The downside is the trays for the pieces are cheap egg shell thick plastic and the pieces themselves appear to be fragile, though I haven't broken any thus far.
B0017HMF6W|3.0|The movie is great, the added extras and the bonus book packaging are worth the money alone ... but don't get your hopes up... the BluRay transfer is very disappointing.  Picture quality and resolution are far superior on the old standard resolution DVD I have.  My expectations were high based on the VistaVision source material and the amazing results produced on the BluRay print of the John Wayne Searchers movie (also VistaVision and simply stunning), but they let us down on this one.  I am keeping both ,though.
0812973992|3.0|I have read thousands of books. I am 50. This book is OK, although I thought early in that it was sub standard, not to my liking.     To give you an idea what I think is high Lit, Le Carre, Hemingway, Scott Turrow, Pat Conroy, Trevanian, Fitzgerald, and a host of others.     This book in my view is scattered, not too interesting, and not very relevant.     Try The girl with the Dragon Tatoo if you want non-stop entertainment.     Sorry to the author, the book is OK but in my eye, nothing special
0385737947|5.0|Attention - this review contains spoilers. Typically, I don't give away the surprises throughout the story, but I have to for this review. If you want things to be a surprise, which I recommend, don't read this review and read the book based off of my recommendation.<br /><br />The Maze Runner was exactly what I was hoping it would be. The world that Dashner has created is the perfect type of dystopian society that science fiction books are typically known for. However, what makes it particularly unique, is that this dystopian world is a world within a world.<br /><br />The world that Thomas wakes up in with his memory lost is a Lord of the Flies type of scenario. The maze world is populated only by teenage boys, and each has particular tasks that they're in charge of performing in order to make sure that their little world can continue working. The other world is the outside world, that some of them seem to have some faint memories of, and when they go through the Changing, they remember that their world is not a world worth going back to. However, they still hold out hope that there must be something better than what they have now, and so they attempt to solve the maze<br /><br />What Dashner has cleverly done to avoid the boys fighting amongst each other is given them something to hope for, something to work toward. They channel all of their respective energies into solving the maze and finding freedom rather than fighting against each other. In that way, it's unique from Lord of the Flies or many of the other dystopian science fiction novels.<br /><br />There is a good balance between the death of the boys, and the difficult situation they've found themselves in, and the hope they retain for discovering freedom, coupled with their intelligent pursuit of that goal. They crack codes, which is an interesting discovery process as well for the reader.<br /><br />Lastly, the ending is perfect for the way the setting and plot slowly reveals itself to the reader throughout the novel. You don't know any more than the characters do themselves, and that's part of the adventure. In addition, the fake murder of the scientists, and the false hope they've placed these characters within yet again makes for a tantalizing next novel. Often with follow up books, they are rarely as good as the first because everything has already been revealed, and there is no mystery. I recommend this book to all readers 13+.<br /><br />-Lindsey Miller,[...]than the characters do themselves, and that's part of the adventure.

0316069906|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone with a natural curiosity about where our food comes from, and to anyone with an open mind about the necessity (or lack thereof) of eating animals. It isn't preachy (though it's clearly filled with plenty of good arguments for being a vegetarian) and regardless of its author's vegetarian POV, it presents some uncomfortable facts about the horror show that is the factory farming industry. I understand those who think that whatever it takes to turn pigs and cows and chicken and fish into delicious food has to happen, but I don't see how anyone could argue that that should include unimaginable suffering, terror and pain. There is a big difference between old-school farming (my great-grandma used to kill chickens by swinging them over her head) and what passes for farming these days. Even as someone who loves meat, the facts are discouraging if well worth knowing. Best of all, the book is completely easy to, um, devour...the writing style is personal and accessible. Really a brilliant work.
B002HWUU2C|5.0|I was lucky enough to say that I was able to see this performance live at the Riverside Theater in Milwaukee's historic theater district. Since then I've striven to see them again and was able to do so on November 1st of this year.     The video captures the moment in the best quality and the cd of the live performance allows me to bring back the  night of that excellent performance any time I wish.     The new album released with these two portions of the live performance in MKE is also something that was very well done. While there is a definitely a new sound to about  half of the songs, they are up-beat in melody even if it does reflect the breakdown of the relationship between both Hansard and Irglova. It will leave music lovers wanting more and will make you wish that you could have been one of the lucky ones to live in Milwaukee to view this concert live!
B000001DTM|3.0|Certainly a pivotal, difficult album for a lot of U2 listeners to swallow (at first).  \\"Achtung Baby\\" made U2 LOTS of new fans, for whom this CD is ground zero.  I'll admit, I hated it at first.  I sold my original digipak version of it.  It seemed like such a surrender after all the artistic stands they had taken with nearly every preceding album (except the top-heavy \\"Rattle And Hum,\\" perhaps).  Gradually, however, through the gluey mess of production that U2 became further ensnared in over the next several albums, the songs of \\"Achtung Baby\\" stayed afloat.  I found myself liking them, despite my initial dismissal.  I found myself buying all the singles.  I found myself re-listening to the album, re-evaluating things a bit.<br /><br />Even back then, though, I noticed that the guitar solo in \\"Even Better Than The Real Thing\\" is a bit of a ringer for the solo in Jimi Hendrix's version of \\"All Along The Watchtower.\\"<br /><br />It's not a perfect album.  It's a little heavy-handed lyrically.  The production and arrangements sometimes overreach.  But 18 years later, this is the \\"classic\\" sound of the U2 that U2 became after they noticed their own potential for megastardom.  I'll not mince words, I think most of what's been etched by U2 since this disc is pure pretentious twaddle.  But I have a soft spot for \\"Achtung Baby.\\"  It's never going to be able to compete with \\"The Joshua Tree\\" or \\"The Unforgettable Fire.\\"  But it's a good album; daring even, for its time.  \\"Achtung Baby's\\" biggest fault is that it's a period piece, and 1991 was kind of a gloomy year musically.  Would have loved to hear the raw acoustic demos for this one -- I think the Onion said the same thing about Bob Mould's abyssmal \\"Modulate\\" album of a few years later.  This would be the last U2 album I would ever buy, one that took some digestion and a bit of coming to terms with the shifting currents of rock music (not to mention Bono's persona) in the 1990s.<br /><br />The tides of music changed irreversibly shortly after \\"Achtung Baby.\\"  A little band called Nirvana would re-write the playbook hot on the heels of this album and nothing would ever be the same again.\\"Achtung Baby.\\"  A little band called Nirvana would re-write the playbook hot on the heels of this album and nothing would ever be the same again.
B0025KVLTC|2.0|I tried to like this one, I really did. But every time I went about listening through Revolver, I felt more inclined to put in Sgt. Pepper's. The album does have a few (not many) strong tracks, namely Eleanor Rigby and the one after that about sleeping. Harrison's contribution sucks in comparison to Within You Witout You. People go on these reviews, blogs, etc. and say how \\"When I'm 64\\" is such an embarrasement, but why don't they pop this thing in if they want to hate on something considered a masterpiece. The last track is atrocious in comparison to \\"A Day in The Life,\\" and overall not a great album, mediocre at best. The best beatles albums are Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Abbey Road, A Hard Day's Night, and Help! respectively. (The latter can be taken for what they are, and what they're not trying to be.) If I wanted to be a helpful reviewer, and not a Beatles kiss*sser, then I would suggest skipping out on this one. It really is more like a 2 1/2, but doesn't deserve to be rounded up to a three. Maybe I'm missing something, I'd love it if someone enlightened me as to why this album is so enlightened. My advice, go with the albums I listed above, most of the rest isn't that good or worth legally purchusing.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|\\"Lungs\\" is an excellent CD.  Five tracks shine for me.  The opening track \\"Dog Days Are Over\\" rocks like a happy anthem with its driving catchy chorus, \\"Run fast for your mother, fast for your father, for your children, for your sisters and brothers.\\"  The next track \\"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)\\" has that great cheerleader chorus with Florence's voice expressive and emotional.  \\"Howl\\" throbs mechanically, almost military in its militancy.  \\"Cosmic Love\\" has an ethereal feel punched by the intense drum, \\"I heard your heart beating, you were in the darkness too; so I stayed in the darkness with you.\\"  The CD ends with \\"You've Got the Love,\\" another strong track. This is a great find!  Enjoy!
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This in my opinion is by far the best Pixar movie out there. I went to rent it the next day it came out on DVD and ALL copies were gone! The story line is great from the friendship of little Russel and elderly Carl, to the bond they create with a talking dog and the affectionate bird, Kevin (who is a girl). The movie never gets boring, It's fun and funny and it gives a very real story of life and friendship while also providing you with the great immagination and animation of classic Disney. Love this movie, definately a must have.
1593072937|5.0|Since I am just getting into Frank Miller and the Sin City series this review is intended for newcomers.     I've always been a fan of hard boiled fiction. I've loved Raymond Chandler (later finding out in Frank Miller's interviews he was a major inspiration for some of the Sin City plots). There's something honest about hard boiled crime. The \\"Sin\\" in Sin City is a very well placed title. The series focuses on our human vices, our flawed human nature that often times leads to tragedy. Here is a man who is not the most clever character, but deep inside, however twisted, he means well.     This is one the things that really sets Frank Miller apart from other writers. He painstakingly makes us aware of the flaws in his characters, the obsessions. They're not perfect, but they are heroes. The realization that those are non-exclusive is very gratifying in story telling.     I loved it.

0786868724|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Mitch Albom.  And I really loved it!  It's short, easy to read, and a real page turner at the same time.  It's moving and inspirational. You won't be disappointed.

B00000DHRX|5.0|The best of both worlds. Two CD's in one convenient package. One CD is for dancing, the other for listening. All his hit numbers:  new as well as the older ones. If you are George Michael fan you have to have this!
1423119509|5.0|This Percy Jackson and the Olympians set of books is a must for any fans of the Harry Potter and Percy Jackson and the Olympians.  The stories are interesting, and have similiarties to the Harry Potter series.  I have to admit that the books aren't written as well as the Harry Potter or even the Twilight series, however they are written very good.  I don't want to spoil anything about the plot, but I must say that you will fall in love with Percy Jackson as you did with Harry Potter and Edward Cullen.  Trust me, and enjoy!
0140120416|5.0|I am not going to go into details because others have already done this, but I am here to say that this book is absolutely amazing and you have to buy it if you are learning Russian. I was recommended this book by Natives, and that is proof enough that this is a good book. This book is the reason why I am progressing in Russian.
B000O178BY|5.0|Certainly enhances my collection and always a joy to listen to the best band in tecno-industrial-metal or whatever the most popular catch phrase is now- don't go without this CD, and get the entire Nine Inch Nails Halo Collection of music. Trent Reznor is the BEST!
B000002LSV|5.0|ZZ Top - Greatest Hits being a greatest hits album with ZZ Top was released in 1992 and contains such classic hits as \\"Gimme All Your Lovin'\\", \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\", \\"Rough Boy\\" and \\"Viva Las Vegas\\". The booklet contains no lyrics but has great linernotes written by Bob Merlis and Davin Seay that describe the band and why the certain tracks were included. It also has a list of released albums up to that point. This compilation did well both with the public peaking at 9 in the billboard 200 and Allmusic and Robert Christgau both gave it positive reviews. ZZ TOP amanges to mix blues-rock, hard rock and rock into an amazing sound with great lyrics and atmosphere. 5/5.

0896898288|5.0|Quilters doing \\"Dear Jane\\" will probably really like this collection of old-fashioned 6\\" quilt blocks.  The designs will remind you of the \\"Dear Jane\\" quilt, but the instructions here (a CD is included with the book) are much clearer and easier.  Also, the reprints of letters (responding to the question about being a \\"farmer's wife\\") are fun and interesting.  The letters, by the way, were written quite some time ago.  You'll really see how farming has changed, when you read them!<br /><br />But best of all are the block designs and instructions.  Can't wait to get to work on this quilt!<br /><br />Since I had seen this book at a local quilt store, I had all the information I needed before I purchased it at Amazon.com.  I do this all the time.  See a book I like at a store and then go to Amazon. com to buy it.  Not supporting the local economy.  Bad girl,huh!
B0015DYIH2|4.0|I read many of the comments for Breaking Dawn.  I am surprised how many people disliked the book.  I thought after finishing the book that it ended good!  Actually. it would be neat to see a series with Jacob as the main character.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I was a sceptic about Star Trek (the movie) because the TV series was always so cheesy.  I was pleasantly surprised when I watched the movie though.  The best part is, you don't need to know ANYTHING about the TV series to follow the movie.  Great action film; Captain Kirk and Spock were cast prefectly.  Loved it!
B002T9H2L0|1.0|I want my money back.<br />Seriously.<br />Put it this way.<br />The best thing of the movie is Brad Pitt and he's only, I repeat, ONLY in 10% of the movie and probably says under 100 words total. Even the slaying of Hitler wasn't that good.<br />Oh sure they pumped him full of lead and then some more, I know he's Hitler, but he's barely portrayed as evil other than the fact that he's given the status of being Hitler. So it was rather neutral to see him die.<br />I wish a brought a book or gameboy or something to play through most of the movie. only in the last 20 minutes did ANYthing really happen.<br />I was ready to walk out had I not been so blocked into my seat at the theater.
B000059Z8M|5.0|I watched TOY STORY 2 last month while on our Disney cruise, and I cannot believe that I have never seen this movie before.  What a cute story!  I  really enjoyed it, and my 4 ½ year old daughter was enchanted - Jesse has instantly made it to her sacred list of favorite Disney characters.<br /><br />Disney does many things right, but their stories with the messages of being true to yourself and true to your real friends are always outstanding.  These messages are so important for young kids, and Disney tells them well and memorably, in many ways.  And TOY STORY 2 is clearly one of the best renditions.<br /><br />With outstanding vocal talent, including the return of Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, young and old alike are sure to enjoy this adorable, sentimental, and funny flim.  The story is typical happy ending Disney, the animation is excellent, the 3-D effects are great, and the messages are perfect.<br /><br />After the lights came up in the theatre, my wee one and I discovered that her 12 year old sister and her dad were also in the audience.  Which is just further proof that Disney is the premier maker of wonderful family entertainment.  TOY STORY 2 is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|The Legend of the Seeker first season is an escape from the everyday type of storylines.  It is a little like when the Lord of Rings and Harry Potter came to the screen.  The Countryside of course is New Zealand again, which is beautiful.  The pairing of the main characters seem to work well together, kind of glad that the actors were less known because it is always good to see new fresh faces. Definitely have made it a point to know and find where this series is on the television schedules now and am waiting for the 2nd season DVD set.
0064430227|5.0|i am a teacher at a headstart, and this is a very important part of my teaching resources.  i love this book, it can be useful in the library area or designing activities around it. i love it i highly recommend it.  in older grades it can facilitate early reading.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|I really loved this set.  For the Matrix lover, this is the ultimate disc set.  From how the movies were made to the Philosophy behind the Matrix, I was really engrossed in the set.  The video was really good but the sound was a little uneven.  In fight scenes, it was like you were in the theater, but in some conversation scenes, I could barely hear the people talking.  My only big problem is that I was really looking forward to the digital copy and I was hoping to place it on my iPOD.  Here is the problem.  The activation code sheet has an expiration...a very quick one.  I bought the set on December 11th, 2009 and the code to activate the digital copy had expired TWO MONTHS before in October. The set was released in October 2008 and Warners only gave you like a year to buy and get full use out of the set. So pretty much 1 of the discs out of the set is really an expensive frisbee.  I wrote Warner Brothers customer support hoping they will remedy this considering those discs were worth $10 on its own.  This is the only reason I did not give it five stars.
B001PPLIFU|4.0|In a fascinating move, Quantum of Solace (2008) picks up where Casino Royale (2006) left off.  Daniel Craig in his second outing as James Bond, attempts to uncover more information about the mysterious Quantum organization that plagues the British government, and nearly cost him his life.  Quantum provides more of the frenetic action, violence, and breakneck pursuits seen in Casino Royale.  Daniel Craig is simply the most physically capable Bond ever, and once again his athletic talents are pushed to levels generally reserved exclusively for action stars.<br /><br />More than just a physical specimen who can fill out a tuxedo perfectly, Craig is a talented actor.  That is not to say he has the same refinement, charm, and aplomb, of some of the previous Bonds.  With some rough, jagged edges, Craig's Bond doesn't quite fit the ideal for the sophisticated gentlemen.  In his two stints as 007, Craig has successfully handled some enormous challenges.  Besides enduring intense physical trials, Craig's Bond has faced his most intense personal crisis in decades.<br /><br />In Quantum of Solace, after a pair of dramatic chases, one involving cars, and one on foot, Bond is off to Haiti following a lead.  After dispatching an assassin to meet his maker, he encounters Camille Montes (Olga Kurylenko), who eventually leads him to primary villains Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric) and General Medrano (Joaquin Cosio).  Bond gains intelligence about some members of Quantum at an opera house in Austria, but is forced to seek help from Rene Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini), after being abandoned by MI6.  From there, the pair are off to Bolivia, where Bond teams up with Camille, though unfortunately his contact Strawberry Fields (Gemma Arterton), and Mathias both fall victim to Quantum.<br /><br />The film does flame out a bit in the later stages, as Bond survives an attack while flying a plane, by making a most unrealistic parachute descent.  In one of the most ridiculous schemes since Moonraker, Bond discovers that Greene is restricting Bolivia's water supply!  Really now, they can't be serious?  Ms. Fields demise, is a worthy homage to Shirley Eaton's final repose in Goldfinger.  The film's finale is exciting and explosive, but hard to swallow, as an entire hotel becomes a raging inferno in minutes.  Bond completes his mission in Russia, tracking down Vesper Lynd's ex-lover, a member of Quantum, whose specialty is compromising women.  Stana Katic (TV's Castle) makes a cameo appearance.<br /><br />Although one of the shortest Bond films, Quantum of Solace is so action-packed, that it seems longer than 105 minutes.  Dominic Greene is a major disappointment as one of the least imposing lead villains in the entire series.  While Mathieu Amalric may have been a questionable choice, Olga Kurylenko is one of the most strikingly beautiful women ever to play the female lead in a Bond film.  Kurylenko is a talented actress, and hopefully this performance will open some prime opportunities for her.<br /><br />Directed by Marc Forster, Quantum of Solace has some missteps, but is solidly entertaining.  Bond's relationship with M (Judi Dench) warms up a bit, as her trust in him increases.  With most of the loose ends wrapped up, and Daniel Craig putting his imprint more firmly on the role of Bond, it is interesting to contemplate where the franchise may go from here.  The film looks fabulous on blu-ray, and the DVD has an ample array of extras.overs that Greene is restricting Bolivia's water supply!  Really now, they can't be serious?

0061730327|5.0|I lived in Malawi for four years and got to know William personally. I thought I knew what Malawi was like, and I thought I knew William's story, but this book wonderfully revealed much more about the kid who built the windmill and the amazing country he grew up in.<br /><br />William and Bryan took me into the life of a boy raised on a struggling farm in Africa. Through William's eyes I feared witchcraft. I felt the empty pit in my stomach from famine. These were new experiences. But there was the familiar as well: running and playing and hunting and failing to fit in with the cool kids. I remembered taking apart my bicycle and then a telephone and then a computer and remembering how each time I suddenly understood how it all worked and how it felt like you could build ANYTHING. William's story is so foreign yet so familiar at the same time. Thanks for writing it down, and best of luck in the future.

0449000729|5.0|To say that the sweep of this book in panoramic is to belittle the word panoramic.  The scope is incredible, a history of England from the ice age/stone age continuously to the present. Style supple and accessible, intriguing - draws you in, hard to put down, a hell of a thing to say about a volume of some 800 pages.  Just the right blend of history and speculation carried by the well wrought fictionalization. Never learned so much from a book so deliciously easy to read.                                                          Steve Goldman

The Bob has been recording for close to 50 years.  He deals a hard dose.  His voice isn't pretty but that doesn't mean he's a bad singer.  And you people aren't the first to say \\"he can't sing\\".    I played this for my 80 year old mom and her comment was \\"these songs suit him\\".  If you appreciate Dylan then you should have this record.  It's done for a good cause.  The Bob's proceeds go to help food banks. In perpetuity I might add.    So if you don't like his singing, just keep it to yourself.  You ain't the first and you won't be the last to make ignorant comments about a true genius and living legend.

Alex and Brittany may come from opposite sides of town, and this difference may also be equivalent to black versus white, but they have no control over what is about to happen to them. They soon find that they are not so much different, and that no matter how hard they try their paths are determined to cross and converge. Simone Elkeles is a fabulous author that has a gift of reflecting the emotions of her character into the reader. If you are up for a trip down lovers lane; this is the book for you. This story is one that will continue to linger well after the last page. Perfect Chemistry is an incredible story, but it is something that must be experienced nothing I or anyone else can say will do this book justice.<br /><br />I am caught up a ready for the release of Rules of Attraction by Simon Elkeles on April 27th, 2010

B002VECM40|5.0|Precious is an outstanding, powerful, gritty, poignant and memorable film--period. I am amazed at just how well this film was done. Look for this film and/or some of the actors in it to be nominated for Oscars--this is all THAT good. Yes, there is some violence that will shock some people; but tragically the problems depicted in this movie really do happen. If you can, don't let the violence stop you from seeing Precious. The plot moves along at a very good pace although it manages almost magically never to rush things; and that's remarkable in and of itself. The casting couldn't have been better; and the cinematography works wonders along with that choreography. The script is brilliant, too.<br /><br />When the film starts, we meet Clareece 'Precious' Jones (Gabourey 'Gabby' Sidibe), who goes by the name \\"Precious.\\"  Precious is a rather overweight 16 year old who is still in junior high school and expecting her second child--again by her own father! Her mother, Mary (Mo'Nique) is also terribly abusive--she is a recluse living without dreams or hope as she throws things at Precious' head while Precious makes their dinner--and Mary throws more things at Precious than just small things! Mary also curses out Precious in a very abusive way; she's like a monster of horrific proportions.<br /><br />When Precious is essentially kicked out of school, her principal refers her to an \\"alternative\\" school, Each One Teach One, which, by the way, is a real alternative school located in Harlem, New York for persons who need extra help with their schoolwork and more. Precious isn't even sure what an \\"alternative\\" school is, but she decides to try it and with the help of her kindly yet firm teacher Ms. Rain (Paula Patton), Precious soon begins to actually enjoy school, learn things and even express her most private thoughts through her daily journal writings which Ms. Rain comments on and then returns to Precious as she does with all her other students. Precious starts smiling, too! Things develop over time as Precious' second baby is closer and closer to being born; events come her way both good and bad.<br /><br />This film, as I stated above, is outstanding for many reasons; but if I had to isolate just one thing that shines the brightest about it, that one thing would have to be the acting. I have rarely seen anyone--anyone--give such a strong, convincing performance as Mo'Nique who truly deserves an Oscar, as does Gabourey 'Gabby' Sidibe who plays Precious. Look also for great performances by Lenny Kravitz as a male nurse and Mariah Carey as Mrs. Weiss, a welfare social worker.<br /><br />Fans of the actors in this picture will want to see this; and anyone interested in the issues explored in this film would do well to see it and add it to their collections when it is released on DVD. This film's a winner; and I highly recommend it.p over time as Precious' second baby is closer and closer to being born; events come her way both good and bad.

B001QOGY9K|5.0|Take the classic fairy tale of the princess who has to kiss a frog to turn him back into a prince, set it in New Orleans, throw in a few practical lessons, like, it's not enough to wish on a star, hard work is also involved, set it to a great score by Randy Newman, with Cajun, Gospel, Dixieland Jazz, and for a little spice, a dash of voodoo; and voila! Gumbo is served.<br /><br />This return to the classic animation style and musical not seen in these parts since Beauty and the Beast is fun for the whole family. The grown ups might even secretly enjoy it more than the kids. In fact, the young kids in the audience where we saw it were a little frightened by the voodoo, and then grew a little restless as the romance between Tiana and Prince Naveen reached its d&eacute;nouement. But what do they know?<br /><br />It's great to see the Disney style animation, with the hand drawn characters over the hand painted backgrounds. One scene was even done in Art Deco style. The Art Work was complimented by Randy Newman's songs and score, covering a lush and fertile musical terrain--New Orleans, the birthplace of Jazz, and also Cajun music from the Bayou.<br /><br />Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos) of Maldonia sounded strangely familiar, so I googled him and found that he had played Diego Vasquez on Christina Applegate's sit com, \\"Jesse.\\" Both characters had the same cadence and accent. I never knew Diego was from Maldonia. Anika Noni Rose, who played Tiana, was in Dreamgirls and From Justin to Kelly, which both had an American Idol Connection. Michael-Leon Wooley, who was also in Dreamgirls, voiced Louis, the trumpet playing gator; but what I wanted to know was, who played Louis' trumpet? Answer: Terence Blanchard. Jim Cummings, who played Cajun Firefly Ray, has done the voices for Winnie the Pooh, and Tigger, too. Oprah Winfrey, chef Emeril Lagasse, Terrence Howard, John Goodman, composer Randy Newman, and Keith David also lent their voices to the project.<br /><br />Bottom line is The Princess and the Frog is a welcome return to the classic Disney animated musical style that will be enjoyable for the whole family.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00001QEE9 Pinocchio (Disney Gold Classic Collection)]]<br />[[ASIN:B000B8QG4A Lady and the Tramp (50th Anniversary Edition)]]<br /><br />Other Roles from Castmembers of The Princess and the Frog<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00133KFGW August Rush]] (2007) Terrence Howard was Richard Jeffries<br />[[ASIN:B000O1799U Dreamgirls (Widescreen Edition)]] (2006) Anika Noni Rose was Lorrell Robinson and Michael-Leon Wooley was Tiny Joe Dixon<br />[[ASIN:B000I2JDEO The OH in Ohio]] (2006) Keith David was Coach Popovitch<br />[[ASIN:B000A3XY5A Crash (Widescreen Edition)]] (2004) Terrance Howard was Cameron Thayer and Keith David was Lt.

B000VSBX34|5.0|I love this movie and will give it five stars, but I haven't actually seen the Deluxe Edition.  My question is: does this version come only in wide screen?  Is there any option of watching it in full screen?  I ask because my Grandmother desperately wants this movie but she has a strong preference for full screen.  Anyway, thanks.

B0012GMZ4U|5.0|The artistry of Barbra Streisand continues to amaze.  This 1966 recording sounds fresh and brilliant--as if it were recorded yesterday.  I bought the LP years ago, but wanted the CD to share with a \\"refresher\\" French class I've been taking.     One of the tracks, \\"Le Mur\\" particularly impressed my teacher (who is a native Parisienne) because of Barbra's flawless pronunciation, but also because this song was originally written for Edith Piaf, who never got to sing it.  When the composer heard that Barbra was recording an album of French songs, he waited and asked her to record it first--quite an honor.  The English version (\\"I've Been Here\\") is also on the CD, so if you don't speak French, you can hear the song in English.  With \\"Le Mur\\" it sounds a bit as though Barbra is channeling Piaf--my teacher was amazed.     Most of the songs are actually sung in English; a couple are performed half in French, half in English.     \\"Ma Premiere Chanson\\" (My First Song) was composed by Streisand herself, with lyrics by her friend Eddy Marnay.      Barbra commented on her 2006 tour that this \\"record\\" has finally \\"gone gold,\\" after 40 years!  Quality endures.  Enjoy.
B00158K0S8|5.0|There are a plethora of reviews of the movie, but my review is mostly a comparison of the BD vs DVD version. I won't discuss its merits as movie.<br /><br />I saw Patton as a child in a theatrical release. But since, I've seen it also on VHS tape, 2 DVD versions and finally BD, as different releases were made.<br /><br />This movie is stellar in BD. It is closer to what I recall as a child in terms of detail available on a large CinemaScope style screen.  The sound does not have 5.1 imaging, but its clear and crisp, with dynamic range to make the explosions boom into your living room, while still hearing the dialog among the characters.  You'll hear more instruments in the musical soundtrack that are muffled by the lower resolution DVD and VHS sound tracks.<br /><br />The quality of the transfer is so good, it compares favorably against the just released Star Trek 2009. Patton looks like it was filmed just yesterday.<br /><br />Having seen several versions it was amazing to see details I've never seen before.<br /><br />In the opening address of the troops against the American flag, you can see Patton sweat big beads under his neck as his speech progresses.  The weave pattern on unit insignias are detailed on uniforms, the amputated limbs among dead soldiers in the opening post battle scene after Kasserine are more ghastly, appreciate the texture of desert sand and its transitions to land as it becomes mixed with gravel, appreciate different types of plants and cacti on the grounds, see a supposed \\"dead\\" body flinch as scorpions crawl on his skin, or read the details on prop newspapers read by Montgomery about Patton in Palermo.<br /><br />In the scene were Patton meets his his new aide after Jensen is killed, you can make out the building's all wood interiors, including lacquer on doors, 1940 era electric light switches with external wiring snaking on the walls, see the notes on the sheet music during the wine-dine session as Patton plans the attack on Sicily, appreciate different clothing materials on all the characters such as woven cotton belts, leather in holsters, cotton ammo cases and bandoleers, to the rust on the toilet seat bowls in the lavatory as Monty plans his Sicily attack.<br /><br />Its more anachronistic to see 1960s era tanks substitute for 1940 era models, if you know the WWII period technology well.  The jeeps used are the larger 1950s version versus the smaller, and lithe 1940s jeep.  The vehicle paint strokes and uneven metal forging are so real I felt I was at the Aberdeen tank museum in Maryland, than seeing a movie.  In the scene where a US column is blocked by a cart pulled by stubborn mules, you can easily make out paint over rust in the vehicle Patton is on just before shooting the mules.<br /><br />The movie also comes with a DVD extras disk that contains the same material as the extras disk in the 2 disk DVD edition.characters such as woven cotton belts, leather in holsters, cotton ammo cases and bandoleers, to the rust on the toilet seat bowls in the lavatory as Monty plans his Sicily attack.

B0026P3G12|5.0|If you listen to this album paying close attention to the range of material covered it's clear that Simon Cowell has a real talent on his hands. Susan Boyle sounds good on EVERY style of this varied album. Broadway, ballads, gospel-type music, pop, simple hymns, nightclub material are all included here, and it's only the really gifted singers of the world who can command all these styles with ease. Susan's voice AND delivery make each one believable. I was particularly impressed with her soulful rendition of \\"Up to the Mountain\\" - any evangelical choir would be proud to have a lead singer like this! Congratulations Susan on a wow-'em sampler of what you can do. I look forward to hearing where your dreams take you and how you evolve in the next CD - looks like the sky's the limit in terms of where you could go...

1423113497|5.0|...and all five in the series, because an adult friend was reading them and raved about them.  I found them interesting, but with several silly and annoying errors per book, like when Percy jumps out of the Arch and falls into the Mississippi River - instead of going splat on the concrete at its base - as if the Arch straddles the river.  And Denver is nestled in the mountains, instead of being able to see them on the horizon...but most kids won't know those are mistakes and won't be annoyed by them. (I DO hope they fix the mistakes in the movie/s.)  They are written in a style that will appeal to teenage boys more than to adults, a writing style much like the Maximum Ride books, but that is fine with my two teen age boys.  Your kids will love them, even if they don't end up being YOUR favorite books.

031606792X|1.0|unless, of course, you are a character in Breaking Dawn...    I will admit it-- I am a sucker for a happy ending. This one, however, is just ridiculous. I was a BIG fan of the first three novels and could not wait to read the last book in this series. There are many reasons why this book fell short (WAAAAAY short) of my expectations, but I am just going to hit the high points.    1. Bella gets pregnant. Seriously?! Would it have been so terrible for Bella to have been forced to sacrifice something (ANYTHING!!) in the name of love?! This \\"twist\\" was utterly ridiculous and is the catalyst for what is BY FAR my biggest complaint about this book...    2. At some point during the first three novels, I realized that Jacob was a character destined for heartbreak. I mean, love (especially first love) can be so incredibly overwhelming. It can make people act in silly, naive, and immature ways. This was the case with Jacob. Although he annoyed me at times, there came a moment somewhere during the third novel when I was finally able to see Jake's actions for what they were- the desperate and futile attempts by someone whose heart is breaking to hang on to something that was never really his in the first place. It was heartbreaking and beautiful... and completely ruined in Breaking Dawn!! Jacob was only drawn to Bella because of the fact that she would one day have Reneesme (and don't even get me started on that name). SERIOUSLY?!?! Now, I cannot even reread New Moon and Eclipse because, ultimately, none of it really matters. I mean, who cares if Jake is hurting? It doesn't really have anything to do with Bella at all-- only her future baby!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!    As I said, I like a happy ending as much as anyone, but in this case, bittersweet would have been so much better!! At least then, I could have reread the previous novels and still been able to hurt with and cry for Jacob, a character who, it seemed, was learning a lesson that so many people learn at a young age- sometimes the people we love don't love us back (at least not enough that it matters). It really is too bad that Stephenie Meyer took the easy way out on this one and, in the process, ruined one of my favorite series...
9113020730|5.0|I was not about to wait six months, so I ordered the hardback from Amazon UK. Why is the American publisher waiting so long?<br /><br />The Millenium trilogy, a landmark in crime fiction, comes to a satisfying end with \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.\\" It's clear now that Stieg Larsson had settled on putting the story of the ferocious feminist avenger Lisbeth Salander front and center in his series of books prior to his death.<br /><br />Lots of unpronounceable (to Americans) Swedish names and places. Get over it.<br /><br />The books demand being read in order. \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" the first book, shows how Salander, a superhacker, and her crime-fighting partner, Mikael Blomqvist, an investigative journalist, first teamed up. The plot, involving finding a missing person and taking down a crooked financier, is all tied up at the end. It is virtually a stand-alone novel. But be aware that the second novel contains a major spoiler to the first novel, so read them in order.<br /><br />The second novel, \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire,\\" and \\"Hornet's Nest\\" are virtually one book told in two parts. In fact, \\"Fire\\" ends with a cliffhanger and \\"Hornet's Nest\\" begins the very moment the previous novel ended.<br /><br />\\"Hornet's Nest\\" begins with Salander in a coma in the hospital with a bullet in her brain. She awakens on page 49 and her devoted reader fans are relieved to see she is immediately pissed off.<br /><br />I won't give any spoilers, but I will say that this book tells Salander's entire back story. Her whole life she has been a pawn in the hands of a corrupt group of men within the Swedish secret service. Everyone gets what's coming to them, and the fate of the loathesome Dr. Teleborian is most gratifying.<br /><br />Most of the book describes the intrigue leading up to Salander's trial for attempted murder. There is surveillance, break-ins, phone taps, interrogations, computer hacking, stolen documents, conspiracies, etc. Salander is in custody almost the entire book, but she eventually jumps into the action when she is clandestinely slipped a computer. Her big moment involves a violent locked-room fight at the end that settles a major score.<br /><br />At 600 pages, this book could have used some trimming. Larsson elaborately introduces characters that he clearly intended to be staple characters in subsequent books -- books we will not see. This is a British translation, so we get words like \\"vouchsafed\\" and \\"kerb.\\" I wonder if the American publication is being delayed because of the need to make an American translation.<br /><br />Larsson is clearly an ardent male feminist and feminist themes run through all three books, especially rage against the mistreatment of women and the need for all people to be able to express their sexuality openly and, if necessary, unconventionally. Salander herself is bisexual and Erika Berger, a major character, has an \\"open\\" arrangement with her husband. Larsson makes a point, though, at drawing the line at child porn.<br /><br />Lisbeth, we're going to miss not seeing more of your adventures.

B002PMV9FG|4.0|I've read every Harry Potter book in the series, and watched every movie. I've loved every movie (except for PoA, as I can't stand the directing and editing). We pre-ordered the single disc DVD (widescreen) edition, and I'm very pleased with it. I received it on the day of release. Amazon, as usual, was flawless in delivery.<br /><br />Now, to get on to the movie. As I said before, I loved all of the books, and have loved all of the movies except for #3 (see above). David Yates does a good job handling the wealth of information from the book, although they did take a very liberal license in omitting certain parts of the book (such as Dumbledore's funeral), or flat out changing some parts of the book (such as Luna finding a paralyzed Potter on the train, instead of Tonks). Despite these minor annoyances, the acting is really good from all the characters (especially Alan Rickman in his brilliant interpretation of Snape).<br /><br />Overall, the movie was very well done. I'm really glad that David Yates has stuck with the franchise, as each movie has been better.<br /><br />If you are a Potter fan, you will get this movie. If you are on the fence and want a good fantasy movie to watch, then I would recommend getting this as well.
B002JCSWUW|4.0|I suppose a film about Nelson Mandela and his attempts to reunify South Africa is expected to include a number of unsubtle and unoriginal racial themes, namely the literal and symbolic divisions between blacks and whites. \\"Invictus\\" is such a film. Consider a brief but effective shot in which we see Mandela standing in front of his bathroom mirror, getting ready to shave; the entire bottom half of his face is coated in white shaving cream while the top half is uncovered. Also consider the opening scene, which takes place on February 11, 1990, the date Mandela was released from prison; two soccer fields are separated by a road, and one of them is bright green and populated by affluent white kids while the other is patchy, brown, and populated by poor black kids. There are also many shots of white rooms with dark furniture, which may or may not symbolize Mandela's hope for a peaceful coexistence.    While nowhere near as compelling as his 2008 masterpieces \\"Changeling\\" and \\"Gran Torino,\\" \\"Invictus\\" is still a fine example of Eastwood's affinity for strong stories with equally strong characters, who in this case are drawn from actual historical figures. He relies once again on Morgan Freeman, and while that may seem like a cliché casting choice, there's no denying that he was the perfect person to portray Mandela; he not only looks the part, he flawlessly captures his distinct voice and style of delivery. Have you ever heard him speak? He can almost always get a point across, not through actions but simply through deliberate speaking, as if to suggest that serious thought must go into every word before opening your mouth. Listen to one of his speeches on YouTube and you'll know what I'm talking about.    The film focuses on one of Mandela's more unorthodox strategies for rebuilding a peaceful and democratic South Africa: Getting the people to support their national Rugby team, the Springboks, before playing in the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Up until then, the Springboks were unanimously hated, mostly because they continued to wear jerseys of green and gold, the colors of apartheid. Many people wanted not only to change the jersey colors, but also to change the name of the team. Mandela, in a move initially resisted, urged his people to leave the name and the colors unchanged, believing that an overhaul of this sort would separate the black and white populations even further. This isn't about petty revenge, he assures, but about moving forward. \\"This Rugby,\\" his personal assistant asks, \\"as a political calculation?\\" Mandela asserts, \\"It is a human calculation.\\"    As part of this act of social reform, Mandela personally appeals to the captain of the Springboks, Francois Piennar (Matt Damon), who initially seems cool on the whole race issue until he's shown the prison cell Mandela was locked in; cramped and lacking both a decent view and a basic bed, he stands there envisioning Mandela's harsh living conditions and has his quiet yet powerful transformative moment: \\"I was thinking how a man could spend thirty years in prison and come out and forgive the men who did it to him.\\" Indeed, Mandela practices forgiveness at its highest level, almost to the point where you're not sure he's in touch with reality. Most of us, I suspect, will probably never understand or even want to understand what he went through.    All of this is well done. Still, one can't help but be somewhat critical of the film's formulaic structure, where overt political and social commentaries are abundant and in service of the final match between the Springboks and the New Zealand All Blacks, a team so fierce no other Rugby-playing country has ever been able to defeat them. If you know your history, you already know who wins the game. Even if you don't know your history, the outcome isn't too far removed from those seen in your average inspirational sports movies. Was there no way for Eastwood and writer Anthony Peckham to go for something subtler? It's hard to say, butI'd wager that much of this material has been dramatized for the sake of appealing to the movie masses.    Still, you have to give everyone involved credit for crafting an entertaining drama. And I admit that obvious representations of racial prejudice are more effective than metaphors, like those seen in the well intentioned but unsuccessful science fiction fable \\"District 9.\\" What we get from \\"Invictus\\" is no more or less than a feel-good story, which I know is something we all want to see from time to time. It helps that the characters are strong and the performances are good; one of Eastwood's strengths as a director is his ability to emotionally develop the key figures of a story, which could not be done without capable actors like Freeman and Damon. So no, this movie doesn't reach the same level of excellence as \\"Changeling\\" or \\"Gran Torino.\\" But at least it gets the job done, and for that, I'm grateful.
B002N3GD2Q|4.0|This live Doors cd has excellent sound quality to it. The Doors were not really known as a great live act, but this set proves that they were as good on stage as in the studio. I always thought the guitar player in the Doors is greatly underrated. Robbie Kreiger unique style is as important to the Doors sound as is Rays keyboard. Morrison is in fine voice throughout.  This collection has 90 tracks(including some tuning up). Listening to the crowd in between cuts is interesting. You can hear specific requests and profanities shouted out throughout the discs, making a great live listening experience.
B001QOGY9K|4.0|In an age when most animated films are computer generated (including those produced by Disney), \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" comes along, and it's like witnessing a rebirth. First and foremost, it marks the return of traditional hand-drawn 2-D animation, a process Disney has not used since 2004's \\"Home on the Range.\\" It's once again possible to see an animated film and really appreciate the artistry that went into it - the backgrounds, the color schemes, the articulation, the lighting, the special photographic effects, the form of the line. It doesn't matter that many of the old time animation techniques have been replaced with computers, including the cels and the Ink and Paint department; the style remains true to the classic Disney animated films, as does the manual use of pencil and paper.    The film also marks the return of the animated Disney musical, with a playful and jazzy collection of songs by Randy Newman that play true to the story's New Orleans setting. While nowhere near as memorable or charming as such Disney standards as \\"Under the Sea,\\" \\"Be Our Guest,\\" \\"A Whole New World,\\" or \\"Colors of the Wind\\" (all scored by Alan Menken, who probably would have been a much better choice for this film), they hold their own in \\"The Princess and the Frog,\\" expanding the settings and allowing the characters to be even more expressive and appealing.    The plot is perhaps formulaic. But then again, even the most beloved Disney animated films, from \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" to \\"Cinderella\\" to \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" made use of formulaic plots, so I don't see any reason for reinventing the wheel. A reinterpretation of the classic fairy tale \\"The Frog Prince,\\" it tells of a hard-working waitress named Tiana (voiced by Anika Noni Rose) who dreams of someday opening her own restaurant and doesn't put all her effort into wishing on a star. One day, she crosses paths with the broke Prince Naveen of Maldonia (voiced by Bruno Campos), who was hexed by the conniving voodoo practitioner Dr. Facilier (voiced by Keith David) and turned into a frog. Naveen, believing Tiana to be a princess, begs her to kiss him so that he will return to human form. She agrees to help, but because she isn't royalty, the hex backfires - both Tiana and Naveen are now frogs.    Thus begins a journey through the swamps of Louisiana, where they will not only learn more about each other but also run into a group of colorful side characters. We have Louis (voiced by Michael-Leon Wooley), a trumpet-playing alligator who longs to be human so that he can play in a jazz band. We also have Ray (voiced by Jim Cummings), a Cajun firefly deeply in love with a star in the sky he has named Evangeline. Finally, we have Mama Odie (voiced by Jennifer Lewis), a 197-year-old blind voodoo priestess who may be able to help Tiana and Naveen. Other characters include Naveen's sniveling valet, Lawrence (voiced by Peter Bartlett), Tiana's spoiled debutant best friend, Charlotte La Bouff (voiced by Jennifer Cody), and Charlotte's kindly father, Eli \\"Big Daddy\\" La Bouff (voiced by John Goodman).    I was especially taken with Dr. Facilier, the most stylish and entertaining Disney villain since Hades from \\"Hercules.\\" Imposingly tall, sinisterly thin, and with an appropriately outrageous getup, he's given the nickname The Shadowman, and for good reason: Much like Gary Oldman's version of Dracula, his shadow is an entity unto itself, able to move freely away from his body and move objects by clutching onto their shadows. His song is delightfully scheming and given some of the best visual treatments, with puffs of lavender smoke swirling mysteriously as voodoo masks come to life and chant in harmony. His manipulation of a deck of tarot cards is fascinating; it's always fascinating to watch a slight-of-hand master at work, even if he happens to be a cartoon character. I leave it to you to discover his evil intentions, but chances are you already have a pretty good idea.    Indeed, \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" delivers just about everything you've come to expect from a Disney animated film, from the romance between a prince and a commoner to the struggle between good and evil to the belief in dreams someday coming true. But in all honesty, I didn't go into this expecting an original story with newly explored themes; what I was expecting was a fun movie with good characters, and that's exactly what I got. And the artwork is just extraordinary, especially during a fantasy sequence revealing Tiana's vision of her restaurant; stylistically simplistic yet expressive, it evokes the look and feel of a colorful storybook drawing come to life. The scenes in the swamp are also striking, not only because of the actions that take place but also because of the attention to detail, right down to the algae skimming the surface of the water. This is a bright, charming movie, a definite must-see for the entire family.

B001AXKXBW|3.0|I know some die hard DT fans will hate this, but I have to write this review.  Having listened and played music for over 30 years musically there just is no equal; DT is simply at the top of their game.  The musicianship is like a group of surgical technicians each with phenomenal prowess of their specific instrument.     Unfortunately, I cannot listen to the album, just when I'm rocking along and totally into the groove completely consumed by the incredible rich musical tapestry I am pulled out, like a breach birth with the unmelodic, forced, and contrived vocals of James Labrie--I just can't explain it; I know it's me--but I just cannot deal with his voice.  It doesn't work for me no matter how hard I try.  It's a thin, shallow, un-melodic vocal contraption that immediately disrupts and destroys the instrumental architecture.  I have tried repeatedly to get over this, but I cannot.    Album wise: Musically the album is 5 stars. Lyrics is 3 stars and Vocals is one star.

B002RBZ13Q|5.0|recieved sooner than expected from amazon, the dvd itself is amazing, the quality is better than any concert dvd I've seen. I happened to see the killers on this tour and it exceeded my expectations. I became a huge fan after seeing them live, this concert brought those feelings back. The colors and detail on the bluray are mind boggling, my wife who would never admit the purchase of all of my hi-def products we're worth it, talked for days about the quality of this concert.
B0025KVLT2|5.0|The fact is, I cannot afford good enough equipment to benefit from the entire cornucopia of musical nuances.  However, \\"Rubber Soul\\" has always been my favorite Beatles LP (etc.), with \\"Two Virgins\\" being my least favorite.  Now, the remastered CD is the best medium to purchase, unless you have the deep pockets to purchase the remastered box set.  The only problems I have are with the possible exception of the last song, which seems to advocate murder, and the method which this CD, and at least \\"Abbey Road\\" and probably the rest, are sleeved into the product.  I am concerned that the slipping in and out of the cardboard sleeve may cause abrasion to the disc.  So, serious listeners may wish to buy a separate case in which to store the actual disc.

B001AVCFJM|5.0|I really enjoyed Star Trek and rate it as one of the top ten  movies on my list for 2009.  It kept the tradition of the  Star Trek franchise yet put a new twist on it.  It was a good  touch to hear the origins of the now famous catch phrases from  the crew.  The movie itself was a roller coaster ride from  start to finish.

B002HRTMHQ|4.0|A must-buy if you like soul music but don't mind a modern feel. So far I haven't been that excited by neo-soul music, except for a few so songs here and there. I really can't take most of these water-downed singers and productions, it just doesn't compare to the classics. This one album is something else though. If you can appreciate a good falseto a la Curtis Mayfield, there is plenty to enjoy on this album. Catchy productions, rich instrumentals with nice basses and horns, emotional singing that doesn't sound faked. In a perfect world this album would get plenty of radio airplay (instead of all these rom-com soundtrack singers who play piano and are sooo deep).     I was familiar with a couple singles before (\\"ain't gonna work it out\\", \\"I wish it would rain\\"), the rest of the album doesn't disappoint. It definitely is more than just someone doing soul music again, I can hear lots of influences from various music genres (such as a trumpet reminding me the Cure's close to me(!) on \\"Your easy lovin\\"). As far as I am concerned, this is also much better than Amy Whinehouse, it doesn't have that annoying over-produced/unnatural feel. Cop it, especially if you already like all this other neo-soul stuff!

B000ZECQ08|3.0|Yes I found the latest installment of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince disappointing. I felt there was too much dialog and not enough action for one thing. Look at all the past HP movies, always a good blend of story with action. This movie was like a melodrama with minimal action. For 2 and1/2 hours that you expect some long exciting wizardry action you get a lot of dialog. It felt like there were not many action scenes. The only real exciting scenes were at the beginning where the villains known as the Dark Lords are flying around wrecking havoc and the ending with a death of a major character.<br />There wasn't even some giant monster or beast or any giants to fight...just some dead people coming out of the water entrapping Harry Potter and Dumbledorff.  It was decent, on - re-review, but it just lacked that spark this time around. I felt this lacked a lot of action that made the first ones great.. What gives ?<br />The only thing I can think of that this is the calm before the storm as obviously this set up the next 2 films which I hope will be full of action suspense, and other fantasy elements that make these films so good.<br />The story is to uncover the secrets of the Half Blood Prince, who is he, and to find the potion that uncovers the secrets of the prince. Lots of scenes of Harry's facial expressions. For a movie of this length there just was not enough scenes of action. Collectors will get the 2 disc version.ic Enemies - a crime drama has more action than a fantasy film. That film and Star Trek were far better than HP.  For me this movie didnt stand out - I made a list of where I felt it was with others of interest to me this year - it is a middle of the pack movie for me.   Star Trek  Public Enemies  Harry Potter (a very distant 3rd I might add)   Terminator Salvation  GI JOE  Transformers Revenge of the Fallen  I love films and when I expect a movie that has delivered so many times in the past to fall way short I was very disappointed. Its not that I did not like it at all, but I just found to be dismal compared to other HP films.  Die hard fans will enjoy, casual fans might not ..  I do recommend the 2 disc edition if you choose to own it for the loads of extras.My theory is if youre going to get the DVD , you might as well go for the gusto unless you just want the movie only.

B000001DQG|4.0|Caribou is a much criticised Elton John L.P. mainly because it came inbetween his two biggest records, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road and Captain Fantastic. This however gives an unfair reflection of the albums merits. Caribou is an excellent release focusing purely on the balding pub pianist and his backing band and containing some great unrecognised Elton tracks. \\"Pinky\\" is one of Eltons best album tracks along with the mad \\"Solar Prestige a Gammon\\" and \\"You're so Static\\" it accumulates a great array of piano based rock and pop. The main track on the album is of course \\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\\", what can be said for this, possibly Elton's finest .AND LET'S NOT FORGET ABOUT \\"The Bitch is Back\\".
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I missed this in the theater so I lost much of the impact of the scale, but really the characters were the highlight as it was the original. I marveled thinking back to friday nights in the 60's watching the show with my friends with our Spock evybrows on, huddled around the tv. They hit the essence of all my old friends in the TV series and as one reviewer pointed out brought out the real Kirk. I was amazed as even their movements captured the characters, and I was sooo pleased to hear Scotty in the end, with his great frantic lines, pushing the Enterprise to the limit! I feel safe with the new old crew in the helm, and look foward to the new old adventures!
B000001EGE|5.0|To listen to some of the lyrics on this album, you can actually imagine some of the situations that made the music. Of course, Rocket man and honky cat will have you singing along, but for the more dedicated fan, mona lisa and mad hatters let you get lost in the words and music, A definite buy for the Elton fan.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|As a huge fan of Loreena McKennitt's unique and captivating style, I had high expectations for this production. She exceeded my expectations with this one. I love this cd so much and will probably listen to it all year long. She is so talented and so original. The song selection is wonderful and there isn't one track I dislike.
B00008WT5C|5.0|Song for song, this album may not be quite as strong as 1979's \\"Highway To Hell\\", but \\"Let There Be Rock\\" was still the best record AC/DC had made up to that point. It wasn't a big hit at the time, but several of the eight songs have gone on to become classics - most spectacularly \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\", which isn't just an AC/DC classic, but one of the instantly recognizable classics of hard rock in general.  \\"Let There Be Rock\\" also sports the title track \\"Bad Boy Boogie\\", and  \\"Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be\\".

I wish I knew who mastered those so I could give him some props here as he did a magnificent job compared to the original mastering.  The early Hawk albums were recorded and mixed poorly, so the fact that the '96 remasters sound so good is testament to the skill of the engineer.  So this 2007 edition had a tough act to follow, but the potential was there as the tech is so much better today.<br /><br />Unfortunately the 2007 remaster is a dud.  The engineer did the old lazy trick of jacking up the bass and using dynamic compression to make it louder and that's it.  So the 07 remaster has way too much bass, the mids and highs are swamped.  And the dynamic range has been reduced by about 50%...Really really disappointing.  So I'd recommend tracking down the 1996 EMI remaster as the sound quality is so much better, and if you get the original digipak there is a very cool reproduction of the concert's program.<br /><br />The 2007 version though comes with three bonus tracks not on the '96 version (which has 2 tracks not on the 07 version).  There are decent alternate night's versions of \\"Orgone Accumulator\\", \\"Time We Left the World Today\\", and \\"You Shouldn't Have Done That\\"...nice but hardly necessary.  The one thing that is fantastic about the 07 package is the restoration of 3 minutes to Brainstorm.<br /><br />The big selling point is the inclusion of the DVD in the package.  The dvd is a regular PAL dvd (NOT dvda as some websites claim) and contains 5.1 dts and ac3 tracks, and a 24 bit 48 kHz lpcm stereo version of the concert set to some graphics, and two very short promo films.  There is NO concert footage, which is a shame because from what I hear it was a stunning concert visually.  The 24/48 is the exact same as the music on the cds, only in 24/48.  I don't notice any improvement at resolutions above cd redbook standard 16/44.1 so I did not care for the lpcm tracks.  I was really disappointed with the 5.1 version as well because it was not remixed for 5.1, it was upmixed for 5.1.  What that means is they take the 2 channel master, copy the left channel to the left front and left rear, then they copy the right channel to the rf and rr.  Then they fold the stereo mix into a mono version and put that in the center channel.  Then they run a high freq filter on the mono track, and put whats left over in the low freq channel.  Finally, they apply a few studio tricks to each channel to make them a little different from each other.  It is kind of like the fake stereo process used by some companies to turn mono recordings into really bad stereo recordings during the 60's and 70's.  And just like there is no substitute for a real stereo mix, there is no substitute for a real 5.1.  So the 5.1 is a very poor 5.1.<br /><br />The short promo films are good though, but not worth the purchase price.<br /><br />*********The Music:<br />This is the greatest live rock record ever released, imho.  And if you only want to sample Hawkwind, or just want one release of theirs this is all you need.  It is Hawkwind at the peak of their powers, with their best line up, playing the cream of their music.  The versions on this record are more powerful, tighter, and more raw then their studio counterparts.<br /><br />Some highlights:  There is the gloriously over-the-top \\"7 X 7\\" segueing into \\"Sonic Attack/Time We Left This World Today\\" where Michael Moorcock being channeled through Calvert really lays out some killer dystopian sf poetry, then the band engages a relentlessly hypnotic groove, with Lemmy doing a mind altering bass solo just before the song winds down. Lemmy's bass work is inspired on this disk, and is undoubtedly the pinnacle of his career. Lemmy wasn't playing bass in this set, he was playing lead bass.  \\"Master of the Universe\\" puts the studio version to complete shame. \\"Brainstorm\\" in its restored version is a maniacal delight (with a rare Brock solo) as is \\"Lord of Light\\" with Lemmy giving it all he's got while Nik Turner and his sax merge.<br /><br />I should also mention that in 2005,  Space Ritual Sundown V.2 was remastered and re-released. The original Space Ritual is a live record that had a lot of studio work done on it; new vocal tracks, rework guitar pieces, lots of edits, etc.  Space Ritual Sundown V2 presents an hour+ of the music from The Space Ritual  as a strait runthrough, no overdubs, mistakes and all.  There is only one detectable tape edit in the hour plus of music.

B000001EG6|5.0|If his first album, the low-budget 'Empty Sky' hinted at Elton John's potential, his second ('the black album') well and truly confirmed it and is one of the most significant albums of the early 70s. Its distinctive character derives from the three features which would become Elton's trademark sound in his early albums - his unique vocal delivery, his expressive piano playing, and the use of heavy orchestration. The songs range from tender ballads with baroque influences, to bluesy rock numbers, and the slow but powerful songs for which he is perhaps best known. Only one ('Your song') was a hit record, but many others have become well-established classics of Elton's repertoire (notably 'Border song', 'Take me to the pilot', 'Sixty years on' and 'The king must die'). (Three additional early songs, not originally included on the album, also appear.) Paul Buckmaster's orchestral arrangements on this album might be criticised as being too grandiose and overbearing at times, but they are part of what gives the record its distinctive character and helped to establish Elton as a very individual new talent in his early days. After two further heavily orchestrated albums, his song arrangements became much more stripped-down and conventionally commercial, as can be heard on 'Goodbye yellow brick road', but the black album showcases Elton's raw talent before 'stardom' arrived. A landmark album - but if you like the style of this you should also obtain the subsequent 'Tumbleweed connection' and 'Madman across the water', which are also EJ classics.
