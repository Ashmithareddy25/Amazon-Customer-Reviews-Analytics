B000002TLX|5|ove Love Love Richard Marx and this album has his Greatest Hits that we all love
B00000JZI9|5|This movie has a great cast. There is humor and action. Kevin Costner is a little over the top in his portrayal but overall I really think this is a good movie.
B00BAXFECK|5|The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt  is a beautifully written novel  with many great discussion aspects. It is a perfect book club read. There are wonderful character studies but it is a &#34;dark&#34; story with deeply flawed characters. Even with its length and complexity, I found it to be a compelling book.
B00MWD7XR6|5|Anyone who lived through the 20th century needs to read this series just to understand what you lived through and to understand what really happened. Ken Follett really brings history into focus.

B00CNQ7HAU|4|I enjoyed reading this book.  I would have given it 5 starts except that I thought the book came with a free chocolate bar.  It doesn't.
B003ZK58WM|1|I'm not sure who is the bigger idiot here--the publisher for setting such a ridiculous price for an ebook or the person who will pay this price.  There is a price point which turns people off  so much it sends them not to buy the hard cover or the paperback but straight to the library for a free copy.  This is the tipping point of ebook pricing --and it has been reached here.

0345803485|1|From page 1, I wanted all the characters to die. I wish I could say I only hated the arrogant prick who plays the \\"love interest,\\" but the main character was worse. I wanted to scratch out my eyeballs every time she flinched, winced, cringed, and especially flushed.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this book is akin to the refuse a pig would leave behind after a 10-night stint in a whorehouse.<br /><br />Don't ever read this book.

B00L6306G8|4|This one sounds real good too only it's just not quite as Hard Rock and Metal mustering as I would like.  It's nice and everything but just doesn't quite have enough instruments or vocals playing or something I don't think.  I think it's lacking something but I don't quite know what, just not enough KaPow in it.
B008CPZNL6|3|If I could download it to my tablet, I would appreciate it more<br /><br />Thank you for the phone version. It is excellent
B008JFUNWS|5|Same review as the 1st movie but I have not viewed this title just yet...very excited to watch it.
B004MOMT2M|5|After buying Moving Pictures multiple times, one has to wonder when enough is enough and the sound just can't be improved any more.  Unfortunately for your wallet that is not the case this time, the DVD-Audio is absolutely outstanding and hearing these songs in 5.1 definitely gives them new life.  For the most part the surround is subtle (aside from obvious moments like the car in Red Barchetta, and yes, the triangle intro to YYZ does go through some speaker acrobatics) while still providing clarity, most of which can be heard in the clarity of every tom and cymbal Neil hits (and there's a lot of them!)    As for the whole complete package, the set comes with two discs, one being a CD for on the go listening, that for my money differs very little from the Remastered CD released years ago, with maybe slightly more clarity.  The DVD has the album is Surround Sound and Stereo options, and as for extras there's a set of three extremely cheesy music videos (Tom Sawyer, Limelight, Vital Signs) and a small picture gallery that's interesting for around seven seconds.  The set also comes in fancy cardboard case and includes a nice beefy booklet with an essay from David Fricke, a bunch of very cool pictures, and (now readable sized!) lyrics.      All in all if you have the album and are fine with it as is, there's no reason to spring for this set, most will likely not care about the improvement of sound quality.  However, if you are am audiophile, enjoy DVD-Audio, or are interested in the idea, I can't recommend this set enough.      And let's face it, if you're a massive Rush fan, the type that has already seen them on the Time Machine Tour and listen to 2112 on a Saturday night at home instead of going out, you already were going to buy this, even just to hear Neil Peart's toms fly around you in Witch Hunt.  And you'll love every minute of it.
1591795230|5|I enjoyed the audio of the Biology of Belief. I ordered the book, but have not gotten to it yet.  I've listened to the audio at least 6 times and I learn a little more with each listen.

B0012QCZ54|5|I am well pleased with this movie. I've never bought anything used before like this without seeing it first. The outer slip cover for the actual case was even with it and in GREAT condition. The disc doesn't even look like it had been touched either. I am glad I decided to purchased this used. My daughter really enjoys dance movies and both Step Up movies are her favorites.
0553583182|4|Book came in great conidtion, took a few extra days than others purchased.   And it is the BEST book I have ever read.
B00BAXFECK|5|Ms Tartt is a master of character development. This book initially reminded me of Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close by Jonathan Foer. But it did not take long to relate to the character who takes you in, making you as reader a part of his life, leading you on a wild ride. Though it is a bit lengthy it is well worth the time. This is one book that really draws you in and leaves you thinking about life. After completing it I found myself sorting back through its content to refer back to the author's earlier references.
B00000F169|5|I've noticed many of the reviews for this little gem have been positive.  However, to the folks who bagged on it, perhaps they should do a little reading about the history of the film and then look at it from that perspective. <br />The movie was the final USC film project of John Carpenter and Dan O'Bannon and has excellent production design by Ron Cobb (who went on to other classics like Blade Runner).  It was originally about 45 minutes long, but Jack Harris provided funds to add footage so that it could make the rounds at drive-ins.  So, yes the film is low budget.  But, the work and effort that went into shows through every frame.<br />Yes, it was a beach ball.  Its a joke.  Get it.
B002M2N9JI|5|I saw them on Conan's show and fell in love right away. I You tubed it, but their album wasn't out yet. My kids adore her singing too!
0810993139|4|This book was a really funny book.  I think that kid's can really relate to this book.  This book has many challenge's that you could deal with in middle school.  I would recommend this book to kids with a sense of humor and adventure.
B009FZZK8I|5|I am not going to lie the first season didn't do much for me...the seasons following starting to peek my interest way more. I loved this season best because of the intensity in it. The survival of the fittest at its best. The characters really do portray what people \\"would\\" act like if we have a situation in our hands like this. It really does make you think that if this were to happen \\"how long would you last\\" it makes you think maybe we aren't so prepared for this to happen. Scary yet entertaining. Absolutely amazing season and cant wait for more to come. If you haven't seen TUNE IT!! they also have prior seasons on here and netflix! check it out!!!
B00C5W3SBE|5|It was a great take on the oz continuum. Mila kunis was one cool wicked witch. She and china girl helped to carry the story.
B002Y0TGOU|5|Great movie. Several young up and coming actors. Have watched several times.
B003NX76BM|4|This is a must read for those who believe that dogs are truly man's best friend. Not only does this book have romance and suspense, it also demonstrates how much dogs assist us in our lives.
0553582011|5|great book, i want to read it now
B004SOR4H6|1|I didn't buy this.
B003G4W49C|5|Well, I'd read this when my son was in middle school - to make sure he was reading it, and he picked it up again 4 years later and read it.  It is the ONLY book he has willingly ever read.  I must say I didn't remember how good it was. Some plot holes of course as it is sci fi, but still very good insights from a kid POV.  It made me read Ender's Shadow which I think is even better, a companion book about another character in this one.
B0017MO10U|5|I have seen the movie.  This one is WAY better than the Ark of Truth.  Maybe I was just sick of the Ori, but Continuum flows better, there are fewer holes, and it doesn't build up for 1.5 hours just to end in 5 minutes.  Absolutely worth buying!  The worst thing about the movie is that Jack is getting fat.  I know, doesn't really have much to do with the movie per se, but it was depressing nonetheless.  You'll get to see a few old familiar faces, some of whom were killed off long ago, and the alternate timeline thing works really well.  The special effects are top-notch.  I was highly critical (to myself) of The Ark of Truth, but this is a far more believable story and is interesting from beginning to end.  I miss the original Stargate series, and if you do too you will be pleased with Continuum.  7 stars out of 5!
B003QSJVTY|4|Great film
B00E8KLWB4|4|I've never played a hidden object game like this.  You use energy when you search for objects and sometimes run out of energy and either have to wait for it to generate new energy or spend money to get more.  I don't like spending money, so I wait and it can be a little frustrating.  However, the graphics are great and if you are careful you can play for an hour or so at a time.
B000001FDK|5|Nothing to complain about.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Very addicting game.  Spend it of time waiting for lives to fill back up.  But other than that love to play a y this game.
B00NEQRNVG|4|I liked the fact Gideon was persistent but disturbed that he wasn't really learning from Eva. She had to be extreme for him to take notice. I recommend this book for romantics. Those who think money and power can get you all you want, regardless of what others think. I chose this rating because the book was entertaining.
B00TU9UO1W|5|Are you kidding?! Addressing the 'relocation' of the entire human race and unraveling the mysteries of the universe (not so much 'what's at the other end of a Black Hole', but why is LOVE, along with GRAVITY, the two most powerful forces in the universe), in the same story... What a tremendous amount of intelligence,  courage, self confidence,  not to mention hubris,  needed to conceive of and formulate such an incredible narrative, and then to perfectly present it in perhaps the best-acted and directed film ever!<br /><br />A high level of intelligence is required to truly appreciate the genius and talent that was liberally poured into this film by everyone involved. Even then,  one must purchase and read the screenplay, and watch the film several times over the course of many months  to finally be in the position necessary to truly appreciate the great gifts freely and passionately given by the Nolan brothers, Matthew McConaughey, and ALL the actors plus everyone else who worked on this project.<br /><br />I promise, if you think you have what it takes to appreciate a movie of this magnitude,  you will be awestruck and amazed to find that true genius is alive and well in American filmmaking. All I can say is,  I envy those of you who are intelligent and open-minded, but yet have not yet had the opportunity to see this movie - you are in for the adventure of a lifetime!
B0011NVC9I|4|I agree with some of the reviewers' comments about Angelina Jolie, she is incredibly overrated, and I'm so tired of having her \\"perfection\\" shoved in my face.  I realize I'm in the minority here.  She actually looked better in CGI than she does in person.  They obviously tweaked her figure to make her even more attractive.  Most people don't seem to understand this... they think what they saw on screen was a 100% faithful representation of her real body.  Her face, yes... her figure?... no way!  I'm sure \\"adjustments\\" were made here and there.  Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't push her out of bed in the morning either, but I can find at least a dozen other actresses who are far more attractive and desirable.    And let's face it... Ray Winstone (Beowulf) looked nothing like his CGI character either!    With that out of the way, I thought Beowulf's character was very well written.  He was a flawed character, arrogant and sex-obsessed.  His desire for women became his undoing (I can relate to that haha).  His lack of will power, and always thinking with the wrong head got the better of him.  I read the original text (I own the Seamus Heaney translation), and I thought the script changes were genius.  Connecting the dragon to Grendel's mother and his past sins was brilliant.  In the end, he redeemed himself by slaying his son and saving his kingdom.  And Grendel's mother?  She still lives in that somber cave, waiting to tempt mankind once again.  And for those saying the ending left the movie wide open for a sequel, I completely disagree.  No sequel necessary, we \\"get\\" the ending!    Anybody else out there think his son looked like an Oscar statue? :D

So I finally decided to break down and read it and I couldn't put the book down! I had to read more and boy am I glad I did! Awesome series ! I can't wait for Christian point of view in the series. I am deffinately going to reread the books again, it was that good!

B00DBSZEH2|3|I was so hyped when H & G was finally released for home viewing.  zzzzzzzz...huh?  Wha?  Oh, I'm sorry, I fell asleep.  While the action was a lot better than HP, the story line became predictable after a certain point.  Ok but, since when do witches pre-Harry Potter need to use wands?  The gore was a good touch.  Curious though this is supposed to be set in old world style but everyone has straight white teeth?  Hmmmm...they must have good dental.  It was way too short of a movie too.  In the end, the witch got what she deserved but the method was very under whelming.  Not enought panache.
B00BAXFECK|3|The Goldfinch is written in the kind of prose that is awarded an A+ in creative writing courses; intricately detailed, but interminable, re-re-redundant descriptive verbally diarrhetic passages that numb the mind by sheer volume, like reading Wikipedia or the OED – which I enjoy – but 800 some-odd pages could have been told in 400.<br />Though the Goldfinch is told from the POV of a fourteen year old boy, Theo, our hero seems to view his world from the POV and values of a middle-aged, middle-class woman with an insatiable appetite for upscale consumerism, from shoes to food to furniture and all else too-too expensive in between; a combination Neiman-Marcus and Sotheby’s auction catalogue running amok on every page.<br />The central character is really secondary to the action [not the philosophy] The plot moves along with the narrator getting stoned and having deep, colorful thoughts – especially on LSD or model glue – and getting himself into deep, deep trouble. But instead of learning, growing, evolving as a not-so-tragic hero, every time a crisis needs resolving, the book’s Deus ex machina magically appears from nowhere, our narrator’s boyhood friend, name of Boris, speaking in pijin [not goldfinch] Russified-english and it is Boris who moves the action another notch. Were Boris black, speaking eternal truths in ebonic, like Uncle Remus, there would be an uproar, but here it seems to fly.<br />The moral of this book seems to be that it’s perfectly okay to ingest  – daily –every mood-altering substance known to man for fourteen years with absolutely no adverse physical or moral consequences for our hero. Around age thirteen, after the life-changing EVENT happens, he starts drinking stolen beer – to stupefaction – then proceeds to vodka, glue-sniffing, marijuana, Oxys, Roxys, dilaudid, X, cocaine, morphine, heroin – and countless other intoxicants along the way. Unlike his buddy, Theo prissily stops short of injecting heroin, only snortingit, no explanation given. The author describes in detail -  about every other chapter -  Theo being blasted totally out of his mind, unconscious, near death, and then vividly describes morning after hangovers in colorful detail as the narrator vomits up the night’s binging. Yes, his vomit, too, is described in all different colors and textures! Great if you like vomit, or finding the meaning of life in upchuck, as our narrator seems to.<br />Strangely, at the end of the book, he/she chronicles an eleven month period immediately after, during which there is no mention of drugs of any kind and miraculously, the narrator has no withdrawal symptoms whatsoever, no remorse, no comment. After a fourteen-year non-stop daily binge-to-stupefaction drug intake, this makes no sense. I read this in a Kindle edition. Amazon Kindle routinely censors out what it deems too much sex description, but fourteen years of teenage drug binging with no consequences seems to be okay. Go figure.
B00RR30UXA|5|Fantastic story. Stay young at heart, y'all.
B00AAQRNQ8|4|This mouse is outstanding for it's price. It is super responsive! I bought this mouse last year and it had operated flawlessly up to this point.<br /><br />The mouse after a year of owning it and using it on a daily basis for multiple hours a day finally started to act up. There might be a faulty connection in the mouse. Whenever I hover over any item on my computer with the cursor while using the mouse, it will click on said object hundreds of times...it will open many windows of the same thing if the cursor hovers over anything. The anchor symbol that lights up sporadically blinks on an off as if it had a bad connection inside (yes i know the light is supposed to &#34;breathe blink&#34; but this is different). I think I just received a fluke. The mouse had performed great up to this point though.

B0039YZPZ4|5|Sherlock Holmes is a clever, fast-paced and entertaining film.  Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are so much fun to watch together.
1400052173|5|If you mention \\"HeLa cells\\" to most people, you are going to draw a blank look or a \\"what did you say?\\"  But HeLa cells are the basis for some of the most amazing science discovers in the field of molecular biology and medicine today.<br /><br />Rebecca Skloot's work is not a dry review of what the cells are or how they were used.  Skloot uses this magnificent line of cells as the spring to dive into the live that created them, that of Henrietta Lacks, a black woman who ultimatly died from the cancer that was created by these same sells.<br /><br />Skloot digs deep into a life shrouded in mystery - a woman who was deeply loved and missed by her family members once she died, and the science industry that took her cells, propagated them in the name of scientific discovery, and then used and confused her family in the years afterward.  The poverty of Mrs. Lacks childhood, and her family plays a significant role in how communications and silence between blacks and whites, males and females, educated and under educated occured leaving Lack's children - especially her youngest daughter - feeling as if the world had a better grasp on who Herietta was than they do.<br /><br />What emerges is the painfully poignent story of a family left behind and used and tired of people calling them up to tell them who Henrietta Lacks was, and defining her only as a vessel by which the HeLa cells were created.  The author diviates from that one track thought process by involving the reader with yearning that she had to know the woman who made these things possible.  As the reader I wanted to know this woman, to have coffee with her, to hear her talk about her thoughts, her aspirations and her fears.<br /><br />The prose of this book is readable and it is compelling.  In all honesty, the last book that grabbed my attention as this book did to me was the DaVinci Code.<br /><br />The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks will give a greater appreciation for the woman that she was and will raise ethical questions in your mind about life, race, education, poverty and our own control over what happens to tissues taken and examined in our own lifetimes.<br /><br />This is a great book!ife, race, education, poverty and our own control over what happens to tissues taken and examined in our own lifetimes.    This is a great book!
B00005QEO1|5|In a time of excess rock,pop metal, and hairspray only two bands were holding it down for that bluesy nasty rock n roll. Guns N Roses and Aerosmith. Aerosmith came back to set everything straight. This album had everything that the Aerosmith of the 70's had and more. Every track is a classic to the die-hard Aerosmith fans, but not since Toys in the Attic had Aerosmith had any strong singles. \\"Love In An Elevator\\", \\"Janie's Got a Gun\\", \\"What It Takes\\" and \\"The Other Side\\" were all huge singles. So this album will definetly be adored by the fans who only liked the singles, and also the fans who dug songs like \\"My Girl\\" and \\"FINE\\". Treat yourself right now!!!

B00005JOFO|5|\\"Great books make terrible movies,\\" has been a cinematic rule of thumb for generations. Commonly, the problem lies in trying to compress a lengthly novel (usually digested by the reader in small chunks) into a two hour movie--the action becomes telescoped, the motivations of the characters trite or simply incomprehensible. Less frequently, an attempt to remain faithful to the text results in a bloated monstrosity which is equally hard on the patience and the hindquarters.<br /><br />At 55 pages, Annie Proulx's Brokeback Mountain is ideally suited for the silver screen. The adaptation by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana is faithful to both the letter and the spirit of the short story--much of the dialogue is lifted from the book verbatim. The film highlights the books' contradictions: epic, yet intimate; stark, yet lush. The characters speak in their silences as much as in dialogue. This is a story that could be only set in America. Yet, it is an irony that Asian born Ang Lee has directed a definitive American masterpiece.<br /><br />Much will be made of Brokeback Mountain's treatment of homosexuality. But sexual orientation is not the main issue. Honesty is. None of the four main characters in Brokeback Mountain attain happiness--and it's all because of the lie. Ennis and Jack fall in love while herding sheep on Brokeback Mountain in 1963. It is chalked up to loneliness and horniness, and written off as a one time deal. Ennis marries Alma, while Jack marries Lureen. In 1967, Jack and Ennis reunite, and the lie perpetuates. Alma spots them kissing and denies what she sees. She never even mentions it to Ennis until a decade later. Ennis and Jack continue to meet sporadically over the years. Given the era and the culture, there are no options for them to live openly. By the time he's 30, Ennis has deteriorated into a virtual automaton, only fully human when he's with Jack. Ennis and Alma divorce in 1975, while Jack's marriage cools into a business partnership. Unless one is honest with oneself, and in turn honest with others, one can never be happy, and the sorrow spreads like a disease.<br /><br />So the great lesson of Brokeback Mountain is age old: To Thine Own Self Be True. Lies, obfuscation, and concealment poison the soul--more than any sexual act or deviation from religious doctrine.<br /><br />Every aspect of Brokeback Mountain is outstanding: cinematography, editing, makeup (the characters convincingly age twenty years without overdoing it), music (just enough to highlight the story). But it's the acting which will stand out.<br /><br />Heath Ledger's performance is masterful. He plays Ennis as a terrified loner, hiding his emotions beneath a gruff exterior, his cowboy hat shielding his eyes. Ennis is so controlled by his fear that his heart breaks just as he realizes he has one. Jack Twist is a more open hearted character than Ennis, easier to read, and because of this Jake Gyllenhaal's equally commanding performance may be overshadowed by Ledger's. But he merits recognition as well. These are both stunningly brilliant actors in full command of their resources. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway also deserve kudos for their strong supporting roles.<br /><br />Regardless of the viewer's or sexual (or political) orientation, or gender, Brokeback Mountain is the must see movie of our time. Just as 1939 is remembered as the year of Gone With the Wind, generations from now 2005 will be remembered as the year of Brokeback Mountain.ess one is honest with oneself, and in turn honest with others, one can never be happy, and the sorrow spreads like a disease.  <br /> <br />So the great lesson of Brokeback Mountain is age old: To Thine Own Self Be True.

B004EC937G|5|Like many others, I was taken in fully and completely by Duffy's fantastic debut, 'Rockferry', but I seem to be standing in the midst of a more modest group actively championing this album. With 'Rockferry', I find that I have to be in the right mood to listen to the work as a whole, or even to pluck a song or two out for a quick Duffy fix. 'Endlessly', on the other hand, is the perfect soundtrack to everything. It's musically and lyrically compelling, and crafted to be exactly what it is: a perfect pop record, with the definition of 'pop' here having the original and true meaning of the term (i.e., 'pop' in the same sense that The Beatles were a pop band, The Beach Boys were a pop band, Linda Ronstadt was a pop singer, etc.). Songs like 'Girl' epitomize this concept, and this record, by fully capturing both the timeless allure of classic Motown and the neo-psychedelic wanderlust of the Paisley Underground movement that brought forth acts such as The Bangles, The Three O'Clock, and Mazzy Star simultaneously. There was once a time when musicians made albums--generally 10 tracks deep, all roughly the same length but displaying a variety of styles and feelings and emotions, with the whole thing clocking in at about 30 minutes--designed to be listened to as a single piece of art. That time, sadly, has become mostly lost in today's truly dead 'pop' culture, but there are some artists--true artists, like Duffy--who refuse to bow to the pressures of modernity. 'Endlessly' is a true pop masterpiece, a brilliant album that will forever remain a touchstone in my life. I'm unabashedly in love with this record and am already anxiously awaiting Duffy's next one. And even though she'll undoubtedly be driven by the powers-that-be toward an overall sound more palatable to today's disposable youth 'culture' (sic) next go-round, Duffy's timeless voice and inherent brilliance will shine through once more. If I could award 6 stars here, I would.
B008XG1X18|5|It is the greatest app ever! I used it to help plan two baby showers, a wedding, and I'm on my second bridal shower(gnome theme)! It's just the best place for ideas!
0765348780|4|Really confusing for the first 3/4 of the book but it slowly starts making more sense as you are dropped right into the middle of a story with little to no explanation as to what's going on, how this world/universe works, etc.  However, this book gets better and is a great set up for the next couple of books in the series.  If you can make it through the firs 3/4 of this book, it'll be worth it.
B004P4S4NM|5|Love all the songs on this album.  Really enjoy all of the sounds of Adele! Great buy, especially when you can download.
B00005JMEW|1|I thought this was terrible. It had a badly written script, bad acting, and ok, I don't really like action movies.
B007HJB55G|5|Every episode is worth watching in this series. It tells like the books it is based on so don't miss an episode. Great acting and great design. Thuroughly enjoyed every minute.

B00W6XM002|4|Good game!
6303418287|4|I don't know about you people but this was a pretty good movie but some flaws.The film was too fast I mean the camera would not stand still and it made the film seem soo fast it was like you put it in and then it was over just like that even though the film is 123 minutes.The love scene was just like any other scene in the film it seemed like Victor was on a schedule or something.Make monster,go back home greet family,go face creature,get married and make love to her.The film should have taken its time it should have had long moments just like in Bram Stoker's Dracula in which this film is a companion with.It should have had long slow more talky moments the film should have been longer it was all too quick.The score is very good too.Maby Kenneth Branagh should have just directed it and not played Victor as well I don't know.The film is good and bad its good on the outside but if you pay attention to the film itself its got quite a bit of poorness to it,but beside all that theres also lots of neat things to look at this also is one of the very very extremely few Frankenstein films that stays true to Shelley's original novel I mean the very first 1931 Frankenstein film was really not at all true to the novel at all,but this one is just like Bram Stoker's Dracula in which this one is produced by Dracula's director Francis Ford Coppola.This movie reminds me of Exorcist 2 The Heretic cause in that film they had all the best people to help make it and great actors but it didn't come out well somehow but it wasn't terrible.Anyway costumes are good sets are good and the Oscar nominated make-up is terrific.Anyway this is a pretty good film inspite all of the negative things that come along with,but its good none the less so see it you might actually like it.

B0041KKYEM|4|Natalie Portman gives the performance of her life as Nina, the talented yet neurotic ballerina teetering close to the edge. In a way, this role is brilliant casting. Nina's vulnerability and chastity mirrors Portman's own public persona to some degree. She has adamantly refused to do nudity and sex scenes in the past. Even in her amazing turn in 'Closer' as a troubled stripper, she was never nude and there was still a pure, childlike quality about her that made you want to protect and nurture her.     In this film, that girlishness is intensified through the character of Nina, only to be destroyed by the end of the film through Nina's exploration of her sexuality and her dark side. Like Nina, Portman is required to 'lose herself' in a way that she never attempted before and the result is spellbinding. Her Academy Award was well deserved.    Mila Kunis also turns in a very solid performance. Her character is less demanding, acting wise, than Nina but I would disagree with other reviewers who claimed Lily lacked depth. It's just that there's an inscrutable quality to her. It's difficult to figure out if she's good-natured and friendly or a shrewd manipulator (which is the point). Kunis projected this ambiguity with great skill and this is certainly her best role to date.     Darren Aronofsky is known for creating visceral, startlingly intense films. This kind of intensity tends to provoke equally intense reactions in the viewers. Therefore, 'Black Swan' is a type of film that inspires few middle ground opinions; the majority of people will either love or hate it. Even though I happen to love this movie, I understand that there's equal ammo for both camps. Those who love it will be seduced by its dark, psychological undertow and those who hate it will shirk from its brash, head-turning quality of Aronofsky's direction. Either way, 'Black Swan' is not just a film, it's an experience.

B00014TJ7K|4|I think this is one of the best in music writting both in lyrics and style. I first got wind of this album when I saw the video for Got My Mind Set On You and rushed out and got the 45 record. I played it alot and everytime I did play it I always flipped over and played the other side titled Lay His Head. When I bought the original album, tape and cd the song Lay His Head is missing. I was disapointed, the song could have fitted on it, there was enough room and time. Side 2 was shorter than the other side and could have been placed on the second side.  <br /> <br />When I saw the cd in Wal Mart and saw that it was remastered, I said to my self YAHOO!, it will may have the song Lay His Head on it cause sometimes remaster releases have extra bonus tracks on it and some of those extra tracks are B-sides and what do my eyes see, Lay His Head is missing for the second time! I said \\"Forget It!\\" and put the cd back and I told myself that I will keep my original cd and just have to find the single cd somewhere of the song Got My Mind Set On You.  <br /> <br />This terrible find of the good B-side missing from this remaster of a great album happened before on another great artist's remastered gemm. That gemm was Cyndi Lauper's She So Unusual when they forgot to include Right Track, Wrong Train the B-side to Girls Just Want To Have Fun single 45 on the remaster release of the cd.  <br /> <br />When will we get the proper remaster releases that we been expecting, time will never tell?
B0088W4YTK|5|The storyline that runs through this series is well written and well developed. And the plots of each episode are seamlessly woven into this storyline, and are equally well constructed. It makes for viewing experience you don't want to stop. I've watched as many as 4 or 5 episodes in one sitting.<br /><br />The characters too are well developed. They have color and depth that, along with the plot, make this a very engrossing and engaging show.<br /><br />In other words, yeah, I think I'd recommend it.

B00000IL29|5|Less overtly adventurous than its predecessor, Empyrean Isles, Maiden Voyage nevertheless finds Herbie Hancock at a creative peak. In fact, it's arguably his finest record of the '60s, reaching a perfect balance between accessible, lyrical jazz and chance-taking hard bop. By this point, the pianist had been with Miles Davis for two years, and it's clear that Miles' subdued yet challenging modal experiments had been fully integrated by Hancock. Not only that, but through Davis, Hancock became part of the exceptional rhythm section of bassist Ron Carter and drummer Tony Williams, who are both featured on Maiden Voyage, along with trumpeter Freddie Hubbard and tenor saxophonist George Coleman. The quintet plays a selection of five Hancock originals, many of which are simply superb showcases for the group's provocative, unpredictable solos, tonal textures, and harmonies. While the quintet takes risks, the music is lovely and accessible, thanks to Hancock's understated, melodic compositions and the tasteful group interplay. All of the elements blend together to make Maiden Voyage a shimmering, beautiful album that captures Hancock at his finest as a leader, soloist, and composer.<br /><br />When I formed my first jazz group, we called it \\"Maiden Voyage\\" after this album. I was floored by it. It was obvious that this was a turning point in the history of jazz. Miles had begun the modal movement in jazz, & a few short years later Hancock pretty much perfected it. Freddie Hubbard on trumpet was at the top of his game. In later years I didn't appreciate Hubbards' experimentation, or to be more prcise, he got to a place which was more avant garde than mainstream jazz<br />like the great John Coltrane. George Coleman on tenor sax is also brilliant. With Ron Carter on bass & Tony Williams, drums, you've got an all star quintet. The finest tune for me matches the alobum title & \\"Dolphin Dance\\" is a real gem.<br /><br />Without this CD, your jazz collection is definitely incomplete. Highly recommended.te. Highly recommended.

The only thing i could even think of adding is a due date or some sort of linking method (that'd probably be way too complex, though.) I tried several before finding this one, and honestly, I'm so glad I did.
B003M6EAXM|4|Well done, exciting action - but now getting tiring.
B003102JDM|1|Unless you're an orthodox Jew, this movie will bore you to tears. Truly awful.    The Coen brothers have made some great movies. This isn't one of them.
B00E5Q1HJS|5|Great action movie with a suspenseful plot.
B005FITILO|5|Judging from the bad reviews, people went in expecting \\"Bridesmaids\\" and instead got \\"There Will Be Blood\\".  Looks like the marketing dept failed, yet again, by portraying a movie as something it's not.  They sell a movie like it's a mainstream popcorn flick to get the butts in the seats, but then many of those butts are understandably pissed that it's not the formulaic comfortable feel-good comedy they were looking for.  This backfires because it creates instant bad word of mouth, rather than the slow, building, good word of mouth that happens when a film isn't hyped the wrong way and is allowed to find its audience.  So sad that the movie business just can't work that way anymore.  If \\"Chinatown\\" had come out now, the idiots in the marketing dept would have tried to make the commercials look like \\"Basic Instinct.\\"  Fools.  As far as the movie goes, it's spectacular. It's a beautiful, dark, little character study.  And I HATED \\"Juno\\" and wasn't expecting much from this but was so happily surprised.  Give it a fair chance. Keep in mind that it's not a raunchy, uproarious comedy, and that if you're in the wrong mood the movie can be depressing.  But in the right mood, the movie's like a shot of some damn fine smoky bourbon.
B00PSLQYWE|5|Just as good as 1-4
B00063F8B2|5|I bought this CD before I saw the movie and was very pleasantly surprised, it is a mix of original songs by Alan Silvestri and classic christmas favourites.  While seeing the movie helps you to understand the songs better, you don't need to in order to appreciate Silvestri's new songs.  With Rockin' on Top of the World sung by Steven Tyler and Josh Groban's Believe combined with songs from the movie and very famous classics that include Bing Crosby's White Christmas and songs from Frank Sinatra and Perry Como this album is great for your next holiday party or for lifting your Christmas spirit!
B000W7JWUA|3|I actually don't like it so much. It is interesting but a bit too stressful for my 10 years old daughter. We played it a few times and it always ended with quarrel.
B000RPTQ1C|5|This CD is absolutely brilliant! The only thing I have bad to say about it is that there aren't enough tracks! Vivia La Vida, Lovers in Japan and Strawberry Swing are my favorite. I was always loved Coldplay but never have owned a CD of theirs until now!

1582701709|5|I'm surprised by all the negative comments written by various people for various reasons. The Secret is actually no secret at all. The principles of the Law of Attraction is embedded in most religions, as well as with most advice and courses given by many successful people throughout history. Most of us have been exposed to this law in one form or another throughout our lives. The problem is we either don't recognize it, don't believe it, or we've just been programmed to focus more of our attention on what is wrong with our lives than what it right with it. The Secret is easy and effective way to get in touch with the law of attraction and how to use it to make real differences in our lives. Those who have written negatively about The Secret do not wish for this law to work in their own lives. And it for sure is not working for them, for that is their choice. I would recommend to anyone interested using this law to their advantage to first go the the website, www.thesecret.tv and view the movie first. It'll cost you $4 to watch it for 3 days or you can spend $10 and be able to watch as many times as you wish forever. If you are moved by the movie, then buy the book AND the CD's of the book. I listen to the CD's in my car going to work, and read the book often. I watch the movie many times. I can tell you this law WORKS if you are open to it. The money spent is minute compared to the immense value using the Secret can be in your life. It can make a profound difference in your life if you are but open to receiving the message with an open and willing mind.

B00F91SCXC|5|One of the best zombie movies in a while
B00003CXZ4|2|DID NOT ENJOY THIS FILM
079073463X|5|This is probably, of all my favorite 80s fantasy movies, the best of them all. This movie has everything: adventure, romance, tragedy, comedy, true love, evil, and redemption. This is a masterpiece. A true masterpiece.<br />A young thief named Phillipe Gaston &quot;the Mouse&quot; escapes from Aquila, the fortress-like city belonging to its corrupt Bishop. He roams along the countryside, until he runs into some of the men sent out to hunt for him. But a mysterious man, Captain Etienne Navarre, appears and rescues him. Navarre is a mysterious, lonely man whose only companion is a lovely hawk he has with him always, and who needs Phillipe's help.<br />That night, as they stay in a farmer's barn, Phillipe sees a wolf and a beautiful young woman outside--but the woman vanishes during the day, as Navarre vanishes during the night. Phillipe soon discovers the tragic reason why the two cannot be together: they are cursed--he is a wolf at night and she a hawk by day. As animals, neither is sentient, so they don't remember anything that the other says or does. Their only glimpses of each other are as they transform at the end and beginning of days.<br />This could have been very depressing, but Matthew Broderick's unusualy humor makes it funny at time. As a seemingly honorless young thief, Phillipe talks to God frequently and, as he learns to help others, becomes a better person. The big-brother-little-brother relationship that seems to form between him and Navarre is particularly endearing.<br />I fell in love with Rutger Hauer in this movie, as the stalwart, tragic knight Etienne Navarre. Hauer's rugged good looks are only a small part of his appeal--extremely expressive eyes and his quiet voice add to it. He's the knight every women dreams of. The part where he watches the wounded Isabeau plummet to the ground and murmurs, &quot;No...&quot;, the part where he tenderly holds one of her dresses, and the scene where he and Isabeau have a brief glimpse of each other as humans are his finest moments.<br />Michelle Pfeiffer, whom I had only seen in &quot;Age of Innocence&quot; before, is perfect as the lovely lady Isabeau. Though she plays an innocent and sweet person, Pfeiffer shows that Isabeau is also a strong and brave one. Together, she and Hauer are so convincing that you'll find yourself with tears in your eyes.<br />Leo McKern is a very rough jewel in this movie. Playing the tormented old priest, Imperius, who committed a mortal sin by betraying the lovers, he is alternately amusing, haunted, and grim. Though definitely not as handsome as Hauer or Broderick, he is no less convincing and just as good an actor.<br />There's no nudity or gratuitous violence in this movie, although there IS violence. There is a bit of swearing (nothing worse than &quot;damn you to hell,&quot; meant literally) and references to a &quot;dark side&quot; bishop who is in love with Isabeau.<br />Although I do wonder: Evidently clothes vanish if Isabeau or Navarre transform while wearing them. Then how did Navarre manage to dress himself, scamper up a rock ledge, and fire his crossbow only seconds after sunset, if he woke up nude the day after? (Never mind me, I'm just nitpicking)<br />The characters are set in a land of lush fields, beautiful mountains, fortresses and ruined castles, forests and midnight thunderstorms. The costumes are beautiful and simple, from Imperius's rags to Navarre's black armor to the bishop's stark white robes.<br />Anyhow, this movie is a must see--it has something for everyone. You'll come away from it feeling a little richer in spirit.are his finest moments.<br />Michelle Pfeiffer, whom I had only seen in &quot;Age of Innocence&quot; before, is perfect as the lovely lady Isabeau.

1878424319|5|Enlightened people dispel the darkness around them. They live more prosperously, with less stress, consider every difficulty an opportunity, and are open to new learning. This time of year is the perfect time to look over the past year and ask yourself the important questions: \\"Did I take time to grow spiritually, bettering myself with reading and stimulating conversations? Am I continuing to answer the  questions that really matter? Did I share whatever good things I found with others, to encourage them in their quest?\\" We are all candles, and sometimes I have felt my flame only softly glowing, instead of  brightly radiant. <BR>I am now house-bound and not able to get around. If it wasn't for reading and personal growth, and the ability to share and participate with others through the phone and internet about the things I am learning, I would go nuts! For me, books are a key to happiness. There are many people in my situation who feel life is not worth living anymore. I have seen that spiritual health, and being in service to others in some way (even if just by sharing good information) is the key to balancing whatever else is happening in your life. That's why I am sharing some of my personal favorites with you (I'll try to keep you updated as I read new ones), words that helped me heal and fan my flame bright again! I also placed this particular review  under one of the books I have read and appreciated.<BR>1. The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom (how even the little things we do can affect changes in people's lives, and by doing them, affects ours too)<BR>2. Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life by Tiffany Snow (tools and training to access our God-Spots for  supernatural gifts, has great stories about healing, afterlife, NDEs, helping FBI on 9-11, etc)<BR>3. The Creative Habit: Learn It and Use It for Life by Twyla Tharp (helps to ease the fears of facing a blank beginning and opening the mind to new possibilities)<BR>4. The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle (accessing the deepest self by living in the present time)<BR>5. 500 Low-Carb Recipes by Dana Carpender (actually good tasting recipes that will help you keep your physical balance, at least after the holidays!)

0316666343|2|At first i was excited to read this book having heard and read so much about it but it turned out to be disappointing particularly the character of Susie Salmon's mother, Abigail. The author never made clear her emotions and why she left her family ro drift off in some far away places only to come back when her husband had a heart attack. I thought the author made a very superficial character, weak and undeveloped. All in all this book is a big disappointmnet and it reads more like a third grade novel than a literary achievement it was hyped to be.
B002ZG99NG|3|I really like the new Ben Affleck . I thought his directorial debut GONE BABY GONE was one of the very finest pictures of its year . I thought he was teriffic in STATE OF PLAY and that that film was quite a good picture . I'm old enough and film curious to have seen a lot of similar films to THE TOWN over the decades . My wife and i watched all but about a half an hour of the film and really dug it (then had to crash) . It was very successful in ratcheting up the tension during this period . The following day , \\"Boom\\" , it's HEAT (and a thousand others) and the career criminal with a heart-a-gold . Time to leave Beantown Ben . Solid effort undermined . It happens . No ill will . Brilliant cast . Three quarters of a very good film . 3 and 1/2 star out of five .
B001BANK32|5|Of course Stephen King is the best. I read this book over and  over again.Good and spooky.  Well worth having
B005CWRB44|5|Been using E15's for 3yrs+ super great key chain FL. Have 5-140lm & 2 new 170lm lites (use on bicycle). I'm about to order 1 more. (PD35 is a great light!! Just bought 1)
B000002NIW|5|Thank You
B00DPM7RJW|5|Great book! Kept me wanting to read more and more I couldn't put it down. It is a must read!
B005ZOBNOI|5|This story was very touching and had me crying at certain parts. John Green is a very talented writer. I really enjoyed this story and I hope you will also! :)
B00DJFIMW6|5|Thomas is super addicting. I love playing it and it's FREE!! It doesn't get better than that. I'd recommend it to anyone young or old!!
B0055SWM08|5|This game is easy to learn and once you get the hang of it, it is a lot of fun to play. Will certainly entertain and keep you thinking from start to finish.
B00DPM7TIG|5|An incredible read, could not put it down. Seeing a side of humanity and wartime struggle from many perspectives, not \\"happy\\" or \\"sad\\". A picture of life in WW2.
B00CO4GO7I|5|What an amazing man, the book reveals so many hidden facets of Chris Kyle. We were blessed to have him on this earth even if only for a short time.
B001EBWIPE|5|A terrific director and a great cast of Hepburn, Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart.See it, You cannot go wrong It's a winner.
B000V7B90C|4|There are few songs lacking that I would have love to see but this is still a great overview of a great band.
B0018QQQKS|4|A good look at the history of the financial sector.  I would like to see an epilogue post 2008 now that the recession is nearly over.
B006MW3V6U|5|This series is great! This is my favorite series ever! Started watching and ended up watching 3 seasons in one weeks time! Very addicting!
B002QE3CTY|4|Started reading it after seeing the trailer for the movie and it was pretty good. Not as riveting as some of the other dystopian novels that have been published recently, but worth my time and I will read the rest of the series.
B00EI4V3X2|2|Small ear cups are uncomfortable and the sound is good but not $150 good. Better off shelling out a few more $$$ for a much better headset.
B00594XOZU|3|So far so good.  Only used a few times with our young grandson who does not have a phone.
B008Y2FRFO|3|Really like this game but hate the fact that you can only play for about 5 minutes before you run out of coins and have to wait again.
6302610702|5|Not only is this a great trilogy, but it is very deep in that it forces the viewer to TRY to understand their lifestyle. Alot of us are like &quot;Kay&quot;, the wife of Michael Corleone(Al Pacino), in that we don't  understand why their family was that way. But that's what makes this movie  superior to others. I agree with everyone who says you could watch them  over and over again. For those that want to know, AFI ranked The Godfather  I as number three on the all time greatest movie list. Part II was ranked  somewhere in the 30's. If your a Godfather fan, you just love part III  because it is part of the set. But if you don't have it, I suggest you RUN  and go get it.
B0067QPVD2|5|Great film, nice addition to the classic 82 version.
B0068FZ0GK|5|How often can you watch a truly uplifting, star studded movie for this price? Field of Dreams is a story that will appeal to everyone. And it is a movie that you can either watch alone, or with the entire family, even Grandma. Can not put a price tag on that. For the money, it is almost wrong not to buy this!
B002APU580|4|I watched it right after I finished reading the book from Jane Austen and I thought they did a pretty good job with this movie. A lot of scenes from the book were included
B00C7KXUOE|2|I finally decided to check this out after hearing so much about it. Although I think it's okay, my biggest issue with it is Hugh Dancy's portrayal of Will Graham. I can't accept that he would actually be employed by the FBI being the twitchy basket case he's made out to be, and his weak character pales against the versions played by William Petersen and Edward Norton. Just can't get into it.
B005LAIIN0|5|a film you will need to watch several times to catch everything you missed the first time.amazing spellbinding,great cinema masterpiece
B003WTE886|1|This is Taylor Swifts least creative piece of music. Her self-titled debut and some of Fearless is alright, but THIS is \\"diary hidden\\" nonsense.  I found none of these songs good. \\"Mean\\" is the most atrocious garbage on this CD. Like Pumped Up Kicks, it talks about getting revenge on a bully, and that song should be burned in a fiery inferno where all good rock fans gather in a circle and watch this song burn in the most violent fashion ever. \\"Mine\\" is also atrocious, but not worse than \\"Mean\\". Also, Taylor Swift sings about being in love in most of the songs. This is advice to NEVER buy this record.
B00BAXFAOW|4|Another outstanding book by Gladwell. Not all the stories are about a David taking on a Goliath. The story about class size and student performance is not really in the David and Goliath mold. The message is about overcoming monstrous difficulties or hardships on the path to some form of success. While the odds may seem stacked against you, you may find a hidden strength within you, and/or a trait/weakness in the thing that opposes you, which you can leverage.<br /><br />So don't be afraid to take on a powerful entity. Don't hesitate because the obstacles are intimidating, or you've had some major misfortune in life. You just may have precisely what is needed to succeed.<br /><br />I wish the book were about 100 pages longer. When finished, I found myself hoping there were more stories. I'll just have to wait for the next one.
B0002V7O3S|4|Looks at the claimed abduction of Travis Walton.  Shows how people react to claims of the UFO.  Great human responses in the movie.  It allows the viewer the ability to determine if they believe or not.  Focuses on the impact of the incident more than the incident itself, allowing the viewer to almost visualize more than shown.
145162445X|3|Certainly an intersting book but the author is obsessed with \\"proving\\" that God does not exist.  Of course, though claiming victory in this endevour, he fails and the very interesting physics is, as usual, quite neutral on the issue.  That the instability of nothing caused there to be something does not prove that the Cosmos needs no other causes anymore than the truth of cosmic and biological evolution proves this negative.  One often wonders why a scientist would so want to prove this anyway.
B002HFP0QU|5|Great CD!
B004EPZ07U|5|The extended version of the Green Lantern is lots of fun and a great action comic book movie. Ryan Reynolds is great in the movie. If there is a sequel, I hope Ryan agrees to do it. I did not see the theatrical version of the Green Lantern. But after seeing the extended version, I can't even imagine seeing a version that is 10 minutes shorter. The extended version of the Green Lantern is a complete movie. Even though I have not seen the theatrical version, it just seems to me that it is a incomplete movie without the extra 10 minutes. I think movie editors are terrible at their jobs. Movie editors really need to think more what scenes are important to leave in and what scenes really are necessary to be cut out of the movie. The 10 extra minutes in the extended version of the Green Lantern movie should never have been cut out for the theatrical version.
B008YI99IE|3|There are some scenes I don't like, and parts in the movie that are boring.<br />What I like:  sound effects(after the plane crash in the jungle; the scenery/view of the mountains and water-especially in the beginning of the movie).  What I dislike:  Billy's attitude and/or behavior(stealing rapture eggs; his attitude towards Dr Grant-I understand that Billy wanted to save Eric's life after he was carried away by one of those creatures, and I commend him for that.  But he should've asked for advice from Grant since he(Grant was the expert).  It was sad to see Grant express his disgrace toward Billy, but if Billy knew better, then why did he do it?  And what I also disliked:  Grant being pressured/sucked into(through the Kirby's lies)in going over to that island-being forced to something he didn't want to do.  Mr. Kirby could've found other people that Grant knew could help him.  Thank God Grant managed to survive.<br />Anyone who loves sci-fi.
B00LP9E79U|1|Waste of money to rent...<br />Blood and gore.  Sorry I watched it.
B00C6PB8XA|2|I believe this isn´t the best book of Paul Auster.<br />It`s a little obsessed and repetitive on the characters.<br />Josep Gubau
B00EMXBDMA|5|This is really a great story about survival, tenacity and human nature.  It was hard to put this book down.  Enjoy!
B00024BHTC|1|Superbly written?  More like superbly ripped off from elsewhere.  This isn't a beautiful album at all but a horrible album to listen.  Proms type outtakes with a heavy guitar riff and out of key vocals sounds crap in my mind.  In fact Nightwish are one of the worst bands I've ever heard.  Kids will love em though, and from reading most of these reviews, I doubt there are many reviewers over 13 years old that are praising this band.  Except of course the Finnish loyal.
B007FEFLTO|5|Excellent read.....could not put it down.  I like all Ken Follet's books.
B00BIKCYAU|5|After being one of the few people on the continent who hadn't watched G of T, I purchased the first and second seasons on Blue Ray.
B004H6G0TI|5|I have a kindle fire, and I saw that some people had issues using this game on fire, but it seems like the problems have been fixed. I have no issue using the controls.<br /><br />At first, I thought this game was entirely too easy, but as the levels continued, the game got harder. I liked the UFO in the game as well. The music was classical and fit the game very well. The graphics are cute and well done. I did feel sorry for the ducks though. There are a ton of different planes you can play, after you unlock them of course. The bonuses in the game were very helpful as the levels progressed, and there seemed to be just the right amount of them (not too much, not too little). I liked that the screen had arrows pointing out the enemies, making it a bit easier to find the last stray enemy.<br /><br />The controls were simple to use and there wasn't anything complicated about this game. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a new, fun game to play. I got this when it was free, but I think it's still worth the money for everything you can do in this game.
B000N3ST7A|5|Good selection
B006LSZECO|5|One of the best Mystery/ Suspense / and Romance novels I have read in a long while. I will read other titles written by this author
B0058EBNAO|5|I've found it to be beautifully  accurate for weather in US and Central America. Tons of info at your finger tips. Widget appearance is nicely flexible for the most part. Has worked great on TF-101 so far. Has become an indispensable app I refer to daily as well as for planning all my outdoor excursions.
B00DPM7TIG|5|The juxtapose of the main characters was fascinating.  I enjoyed the journey!
B0011WL8MK|5|I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS ONE BUT I GAVE IT AS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT AND THE MAN SAID IT WAS GREAT.  CAME EARLIER THAN EXPECTED, JUST BEFORE XMAS.  HE'S BEEN L0OOKING FOR THIS FOR YEARS AND WAS VERY PLEASED WITH IT.  OF COURSE JACK BENNEY IS ALWAYS FUNNY.  I THANK YOU AMAZON.  I'M TRUELY GLAD I FOUND YOU!
B004XZR63M|4|This book makes you think about your life choices and gives you advice (very detailed I must say) on how to really have money work for you.
1607066017|5|Good comic to start a new series
B004FRX0MY|5|Good music choices
B008JFUQ16|5|This was a very cute movie.  We have already purchased Despicable Me and hope that there will be more movies in the future.
B000DWMYQ8|5|Funny movie
B00IU0M85C|5|I have to write a painfully long paper on modernizing Japan and literature production, but this has SAVED MY LIFE.
B00T6NBG2I|1|How am I supposed to enjoy this app if the app won't even open or load at all? That makes this app a total waste of time.
B003G4W49C|4|Very good story! Haven't read the next book in the series but I'm in the process of acquiring the book
B000024D4R|3|The members of Pink Floyd themselves have admitted throwing this album together in a very hasty fashion in order just to have some tour material.   This, coupled with other things, is why I give this album only three stars.<br />Pigs on the Wing parts I and II are both very good, short but sweet, songs.  A better version of the two combined can be download from the various places on the internet.<br />Dogs, Pigs (three different ones), and Sheep, the majority of the album, are all pretty much the same, which doesn't really present a problem if you like any one of the songs.<br />Moderately reccommended.
B00D7Z4GQY|4|I enjoyed this book. Took it on a trip and it was the perfect vacation book. Not so engrossing that I couldn't put it down, but a book I enjoyed getting back into it. I liked the characters and the fact they were Austrailian and story was based there, gave it a fun twist.<br />I'd reccomend the book to a friend.
B00005R24G|5|For those of you who have been disappointed by the version of Sleuth in the white box, take heart and trade up to the black one.  The film is widescreen, entirely presented on one side, and the sound is excellent.  In addition, the DVD includes an interview with playwright Andrew Shaffer about the conception, original staging and film adaptation of \\"Sleuth.\\"  If you haven't already seen this most brilliant of screen thrillers, please kill yourself now.
B00AREIAI8|5|Such a fun game!  Our family takes turns with this one! We love it!
B00FEHXCIG|2|I had to watch this movie without any sound. I am very disappointed in this purchase.
B004LWZWGK|5|Love this movie and it just gets better on blu-ray. It is a must for every batman lovers movie library
B009MF5BXK|2|There's something missing in this follow up to the enjoyable Expendables 1. Overall it felt as if the story and characters relied too much on cookie cutter formulas taking a backseat to the action sequences. It also felt like the large ensemble cast was poorly juggled compared to the first film.<br /><br />Speaking of that ensemble there's a large cast which shows that doesn't always make a memorable film: Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Statham, Liam Hemsworth, Jet Li, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Dolph Lundgren and Chuck Norris.<br /><br />Again, quite the disappointment.<br /><br />The budget was $100M and it made over $315M at the Box Office.<br /><br />SOUND: C plus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: C plus to B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus to B minus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: C minus; ACTION SEQUENCES: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: mid December 2012; OVERALL GRADE: C plus.
B008G33PMI|1|I was really looking forward to this, as I love Tarja, and was hoping to get some of her great Nightwish music but without the male vocal parts which I've never cared for.  I own every other piece of music (that I am aware of) that Tarja or Nightwish (with Tarja) ever recorded.<br /><br />Unfortunately, whoever mastered \\"Act 1\\" is apparently stone deaf (or was trying to turn Tarja into grunge).  The base is so overpowering that much of the other music is lost unless you apply massive equalization, which helps, but can't fix the huge amount of distortion since either the audio was overdriven when it was recorded, or the mastering levels were done so high that the equipment itself was clipping and distorting.  Not only is the base terrible because of this, but in the powerful sections of the music, everything, including Tarja's voice suffers from terrible clipping and distortion.<br /><br />I'm not even going to bother ripping these CD's, instead I'll be asking for a refund, as for anyone who really likes music with any clarity at all, both CD's are just terribly painful to listen to.
B00FF8OKJE|5|It is such a good strategy game really easy
B00A3NQNUU|5|in dragonvale I have too many moon dragons. (in case you were wondering moon dragons are RARE) this game is so much fun!!! lasts me hours!!
014241493X|1|disappointed with this book. had high expectations and this book was too boring for me.. forced myself to finish...
B0055SWM08|2|don't get it but it is very addicting that is why people gave it 5 stars listen to Md ok and if you don't then you will be addicted to it
B008J1Q1R8|5|Was a fully inspirational book that showed what an amazing individual Nelson Mandela is. I loved this book and have recommended it to my friends.
B00PTB7B34|5|Nice game to play but to time consuming
B00MUCX6AW|5|Awesome movie!!
075669812X|5|My grandson found this book at a book fair at twice the cost.  He is in second grade and was excited that he could read the book himself.  DK Publishing never lets me down.
B0058EBNAO|5|I had inadvertently not changed  my time zone and I sent a note to support.  They responded in record  time. Great Support! I love this App...best weather app of all time!
B00IG2DOKM|5|Great game. So easy to learn and fun. Great for the kids to learn about goods and services and to use money(the money you earn in the game).
B00DFFI7K2|4|This is entertaining action movie. Lot of different action from simple fight to Kung fu style action, guns, tanks and of course Bruce Willis .
B000NQR7NO|5|I was a bit anxious about the new album from Arctic Monkeys, because most bands have problems to clear the bar of a great début. The first single, Fluorescent Adolescent, was not really what I expected from the band. I bought the record anyway, and am glad I did. FA as a single may not work, but its absolutely ok within the context of the whole album. Favourite Worst Nightmare rocks. That was the first thing I noticed. The songs are more mature, and are much harder than the ones on the first record. One could say that Arctic Monkeys just push on from where the first album ended. There is nothing that can stop these guys. If you liked the first one, you are going to love this one!
B00005N9CV|1|I was very pleased to see that Diana was releasing a new CD so I pre-ordered (very convenient).  While I know that this was another step forward in her musical career, I was disappointed with the syrupy arrangements and heavy strings.   She is an incredibly accomplished musician and songstress and I was looking forward to another well-crafted, intimate jazz album, with tight arrangements, showcasing her voice as well as her excellent piano skills and that of the other fine jazz musicians in her group.  I would not have purchased this if I had heard the musical clips on Amazon
B00HZ3C4N6|3|3.5 review. Good casting, plenty of action.
B00PSLQYWE|5|Love this series. Can`t wait for season 6.
1608871452|5|This book is amazing. So much eye candy I cant stand it. They have posters and sticker and postcards and just everything you could ever want. I suggest buying 2 just to have back up its THAT great. Its great for the coffee table but i might salt and burn anyone who dare touch it!! A truly beautiful book!!!!!
B0088WK27S|5|The movie was not what I originally expected but it was pretty good
B00HGJ18C2|4|It's a time killer but would prefer to make my own choice where I can place my cards.  It will work for a boredom buster.
1781162646|5|All I can say is this book is worth every penny. I would easily place this in a top 5 of Stephen King's best works. Stunning and very emotional. It's a story where you feel connected to the characters and care about them, something that isn't in many books nowadays.<br /><br />Well done, Mr. King. You gave your Constant Readers a real treat.
B003HE2B6C|5|i LOVE hanson's 5th studio album \\"shout it out\\" .... it has an amazing blues/pop/indie rock feel to it, unlike anything out there right now!   i don't think i could possibly pick a favorite song!   i can't wait to get to the concerts to start hearing these songs live!
B00HXYKYIE|1|Realized I don't believe in the subject matter so quit the book.
B003TSEL7S|5|An epic begining to Rick Riordan's new series&#34;The Heros of Olympus&#34; Gea is waking and the gods have gone silent and its up to new charicters Piper McLean a charm talking &#34;kleptomaniac&#34;girl who has a choice to make her father or her friends.Leo Valdez who has a scary secret.Jason Grace a boy who is sufforing from amnesia and can speek Latin instead of Greek and does't know were he came from.And many more!
0385474547|3|This book really is good to read if you want to know about Nigerian culture in the 1800's.  I learned a lot from this book.  However, I didn't really enjoy reading though.  It was hard to like the book, when I really didn't like the main character, Okonkwo.  Okonkwo was really hateful, but I sort of understood where he was coming from.  He was really tough on everyone because he didn't want to be seen as weak, like his father, unoka, was.  It's an ok book, but not great.
030746363X|5|Tim Ferris is a bit odd, thank goodness for that. His obsession with ferreting out the best alternative towards life often leads to out of the box thinking. He is right to do so and you reap the rewards of his outlandish attempts and his somewhat obsessive record keeping.    I am a 56 year old man and familiar with much of what Tim has written , in fact I worked for the swimming guru that created Total Immersion.    Nevertheless in a clear and well written sliver of a book Tim gives great advice and even if you use only part of the advice it is money well spent. Moreover if you accept his way of thinking and expand in your own quest for optimum health in a minimum amount of time and effort ......BUY THIS BOOK .    I could write more but stop wasting time; start on this path towards a better life .
B004LWZWGK|5|Very satisfied with this product and service.
B007IXWL2C|5|I'm am absolutely in love with these fascinating yet very seductive books. Two thumbs up and I can't wait until movie comes out:)
B005S9EKCW|5|Love it!
B00AREIAI8|5|I love this game because it is so fun to play and it is the best game ever made in the world.
B00IXF85CY|4|Good to see a movie without all the gore with a very good story. Shows the struggles that people had to deal with during war.
B00FN811SY|5|I got this on my kindle and it works fine and it is so easy to update .and I can get all books for the ministry and the meetings!!!!!
B00006D295|5|Ideally this shouldn't be available on DVD or VHS at all, because people should see it in the theater.  You won't \\"get it\\" watching this if you haven't seen it in a theater.  (Unfortunately our theater stopped showing it after the VHS tape came out.)  The amazing thing about seeing people act out the parts perfectly in the theater was knowing they learned it by going to the theater every week...not by practicing the parts at home. <br />  <br />Now on to the transfer: Someone commented about the sound being remixed.  What they didn't realize is that the stereo AND mono mixes are available on this disc, which is wonderful.  Most theaters show the mono version, yet the stereo remix used to be the only thing available on VHS (unless you had the Japanese import...).  And the live clips and audience participation aren't as bad as I thought they would be (that participation album is embarrassing!). <br /> <br />The actual sound fidelity is MUCH better on my hi-fi VHS tape though, although there *could* be something set wrong on the stereo downmix on the DVD players I've used (though I've used more than one and have fiddled with them all, and have tried both the mono and stereo versions). <br />  <br />Anyway this is a treasure for Rocky fanatics but not Rocky virgins.
B00MB6IYHW|5|It isn't often that I watch a movie that is this long and feel the movie was going pleasantly quickly and kept me entertained all the way threw.  Very Well done.  Enjoyed it greatly.
B005KJZDXK|4|Got this CD for my brother as a Christmas gift, and once again She & Him never fail to disappoint!!! Highly recommend and as usual service from Amazon was impeccable.
B008Y2FRFO|2|Yet for some reason I keep playing. Don't get sucked into buying more &#34;coins&#34; though. It's unnecessary unless you feel the need to drop coins 24/7
B00AGE20ZI|5|I absolutely love this movie. My favorite Christmas movie ever!!!!  Really gets me into the Christmas spirit!!  I introduced my daughter to it this year and she loved it!!
B00BAXFJ5M|5|Another great story<br />Edgar is awesome<br />Very disappointed that TV show was cancelled.  It was a great complement to character development.
B006ID6NDQ|5|This is not for the faint of heart.  I am an African American, not immune to what it is like to struggle with racism both in this country and abroad, but this book has changed my whole outlook on life.  It has made me want to live more fully, and to treasure everything: each morsel of food, underwear, my family, my medical insurance.  Hate is a powerful thing, and this book shows how it can destroy both the oppressed and the oppressor.
1433502410|5|This study bible is more than adequate to interpret the bible. Translations and word derivatives are excellent. So many interpretations you are more than able to understand the bible better than ever before. Welcome addition to my library!
B003G4W49C|5|I loved the book! And highly suggest it to anyone looking for a good science fiction read. This is coming from a halo series reader

B00MWD7XR6|1|What a disappointing end to a long wait.  This the final installment of the trilogy did an injustice to the first two installments.
B0020BUWX2|4|This was a great book - easy to read and I could hardly put it down.  I didn't like how it ended.  I wasn't sure if it was still going, or the start of a second book, or what.
0345529057|5|swell awesome fab fabulous no comprendo halla at this review yes books done writing done erythang big! greatly grateful i am!
B00B8M4IMK|5|I bought this because a friend was raving about anker products and my new car doesn't have a USB port like my last one... I have to say, I love this thing. It actually charges.  Previous chargers I have used just seemed like they maintained whatever battery life I had while I was in the car, never really charging... but I can plug into this and even if I am just going 10 minutes down the road, I get a really really good charge.  I will be buying none other than anker chargers going forward.

B006MW3UZW|5|Watching an episode of this show is like taking one bite of a delectable dessert and then wanting to have the next bite right away.
B006VFQGFQ|4|If not for some minor flaws, I would've given this film bio five stars but nevertheless it's an impressive production by Eastwood and boasts one of DiCaprio's most impressive performance(a pity he didn't get an Oscar nomination for this one) and fine supporting turns from Judi Dench as Hoover's domineering mother, Arme Hammer as Clyde Tolson and Naomi Watts as his long suffering secretary.  I thought I would be bored by the length but I wasn't and Eastwood's direction hooked me in.  The only flaws in this film are the horrible makeup job on Hammer's aging Tolson and the actor playing Nixon---he doesn't even come close to looking like \\"tricky Dick\\" (couldn't they have used Philip Baker Hall for the disgraced President?).  But outside of these flaws, this is still a worthwhile film into the complex life of \\"J. Edgar\\".
B00004SZWD|3|I'm a big Stevie Wonder fan because he is the master of melody, but I have to admit that &quot;S.I.T.K.O.L.&quot; isn't very enthralling.  Only one or two other reviewers had the same standpoint.  I don't see why everyone keeps giving it 5 stars.  Even though I like when artist put a lot of songs on an album, it's more the quality (as opposed to quantity) that I care about more.  If Stevie would've have taken all the radio hits and a few other note-worthy songs and made them into a single album, that would've been much better.  Instead I feel short-changed, sorting through the &quot;not-so-captivating&quot; songs just to hear the gems &quot;Summer Soft&quot; and &quot;Another Star&quot;.  Even the songs I actually like I skip towards the end because they trail on waaaaay too long (i.e. &quot;Ordinary Pain&quot; with its segueway, &quot;Joy Inside My Tears&quot; with its refrain, and &quot;Black Man&quot; with its Black Panther-esque chants).  And what's up with &quot;Saturn&quot;?  I mean it's a good song, but it's just plain weird.  I'm sorry to say that you're not missing anything by passing this up at the store.  Get either &quot;Innervisions&quot; or some greatest hits compilation if you really have to have some Stevie Wonder in your collection.
B00005221M|4|true, it's got it's historical inaccuracies, it's a bit p.c. in places but this is still a good yarn. battle scenes are pretty graphic at times but overall this is a good old-fashioned adventure movie and great entertainment. by the way, peter stines from texas doesn't like the british! boo hoo! do you actually think we care? this section is for reviewing movies not a political forum. get a life.
B006OCM0G0|5|I was expecting it to be awesome because it was a team lava game but then when i started playing the game i was like WHAT!!!!!! I loved it so much i even found my friend on there gymnasticscafe( i am not going you her real name) and she was awesome  this game is the second best game ever (after fashion story) and this game is right for both boys and girls :)yaaaaaay :-)so much fun :-D
B005T87QCI|5|oh ya this game is cool but I wish they could put in atom and sues it has very good graphics
B00QW8TYWO|4|My kids and I have so much fun with this game! It's a great time killer &amp; it causes so many giggles! Plus no need to spend money. Game makes it easy to earn coins by watching a 15 sec video &amp; you can do this every few minutes. It's now my daughter's mission to get EVERY character!
B00IKZX1ZI|4|The game is fun for both myself and my family.<br />I like that you don't need to ask friends for things to move from level to level.
B009WUBERW|3|I liked it.
B00009R86L|5|I use this with my soccer bag. It's infinitely better than the strap pad that came with the bag.<br /><br />For that little extra comfort, this is one of those small purchases that comes in at a huge value.
0545123275|2|I read a lot of YA books, and while werewolves really aren't my thing, I'm willing to give anything a try if it seems like it's well received. I can honestly say that the appeal for this one makes no sense to me at all. I wish it did. So many reviewers raved about it, and I never caught the fever. The main characters are flat, there are no parents to be found anywhere (they must let their children run wild like the wolves, I guess), and the dialogue was just painful. PAINFUL. The other thing that bugged me was that the story is told from the perspectives of its two main characters, Sam and Grace, and while that alone is fine, the way they portrayed each other conflicted too much for me. For example, in Grace's narratives, she struck me as kind of forward-thinking, blunt, and a bit daring. But in Sam's narratives, she came across as more timid and shy and girly. You might say that our views of ourselves will always be different from the way others see us, but this issue was most apparent during the dialogue, and it's a little harder to hide there.
B00004STPT|5|I bought this soundtrack used and listened to it so much that it wouldn't run in my cd player anymore. I am buying a new one because it rules!  Hans Zimmers past work such as Crimson Tide is good but this is his best by far.
B009NF54ZE|4|If you like these type of hidden object games, you'll like this one. My kids really enjoy it. I like it fine ans the story line is interesting.
B00C5R7B0I|5|Love the Scarpetta series of books she writes!!  She make you feel as if you know the characters personally and therefore these books are an excellent read and hard to put down. I suggest reading all of her Scarpetta series books!
B00QW8TYWO|5|In this game you can be many different characters crossing highways, train tracks, and water to get to the other side...if there is an end. But if you're not fast enough, you get eaten by a bird. Even if you're a horse. 0_0 CHECK IT OUT! You'll love Crossy Road! I hope... -thejaustin
B00HB8UWCU|5|I chose this rating because the movie was really interesting and it was a movie that would change because of the prisons
B0083B3KOQ|5|App does just what I wanted it to- have converted m4v file of grandchildren taken with an IPhone to mp4 format that I can see on my Kindle.
B00GT4V5DM|5|It catches malware that other software does not .Works real well ! It has saved me from crashes more then once .
B00IVD2HMW|5|This is the longest, best designed point and click ever. It's challenging without being impossible, and the hints and helps -- including an option to have the game solve the puzzle for you if you're completely stuck -- is beyond awesome. I'm looking forward to trying another one by these guys.
B00FATEJYE|1|This awesome game will be great and you could also buy gold packages for game money!!!!!&eth;
B001HBYHFA|5|This is one of the modern classic space western/sci-fi movies of our age.  Watching Firefly and Serenity are must-do's for all modern sci-fi fans.
B00DJFIMW6|5|If you are looking for an entertaining game that gives you a challenge when you are sitting inside on a rainy day or half way through a road trip this game would be the best to sit down with. And one of.the things I love is the way the minions act on this game. I mean who doesn't love minions?
B007J4T2G8|5|Fast read, edgy, somewhat uncomfortable, but cannot put it down! Reading book 2 now, will see if the edge stays
B00BHHIWQO|5|Very intense game,things really heat up when the fire square appears.only draw back is you lose your life after each maze.
0316017922|1|This is one of the worst books I've read--such a bunch of b.s.  How can this piece of crap still be no. 3 on the New York Times non-fiction best sellers list?    At first, it's a little fascinating to read some sections.  But afterward I just kept thinking, \\"this is such a total bunch of b.s.  This author is full of it.\\"    As pointed out by a lot of other reviewers, this book is filled with errors.  But it also ignores huge exceptions.  For example, Gladwell repeats over and over again the arduousness of rice farming in Southern China (making the Chinese so amazingly smart and industrious).  First, what about all the urban Chinese (including those who work in factories)--most of whom think that rice farmers are stupid and lazy?  Second, what about Thailand, Burma, Cambodia, Philippines, and Indonesia?  If anything, those people (where rice paddy farming is at least as important) should be a lot smarter than any Chinese.    Gladwell's exhilarating little \\"discoveries\\" also ingore more-boring parallel worlds.  The town in the \\"Roseto Mystery\\" can be any ethnic immigrant neighborhood anywhere in America (he says that the Italians who created Roseto Pa. were amazingly healthy because they \\"had created a powerful, protective social structure capable of insulating them from the pressures of the modern world.\\").  What about all the other Little Italies in the U.S.?      The chapter about a few hugely-succesful Jewish New York corporate bankruptcy/mergers/acquisitions lawyers can also apply to children or grandchildren of almost any ethnic group in any other big Eastern or Midwestern city.      This sentence on p. 132 is an example of the sloppiness of the book: \\"[People] born before 1911 . . . graduated from college at the height of the Depression, when job opportunities were scarce, and they were already in their late thirties when the Second World War hit, meaning that when they were drafted, they had to disrupt careers and families and adult lives that were already under way.\\"  What?  First, how many people were drafted in their late 30s (or even early 30s)?  I always thought draft age was a lot younger than that.  Second, factory and skilled workers were NOT drafted (because their skills were needed in production).  These people were in the right places at the right time.  They saved up fortunes in overtime pay (and started businesses that took off because of the war, and after the war).  Men born in the early-1920s were jealous of their older brothers who made good money during the WWII.    Reading this book made me think back about Blink and Tipping Point and wonder if they, too, were just a total bunch of b.s.  The Hush Puppies shoes story in Tipping Point at the time seemed like an exaggerated story by Gladwell (I never remembered any Hush Puppies craze that suddenly took over the country the way Gladwell talks about it).
B00DURGZHW|3|Not the best movie I've ever seen, but keeps your interest, moves smoothly, OK storyline. I may watch it again.
B00688628M|5|Great show
B000002O5L|5|A quaint example of 80s American heartland rock. Every chord of Mr. Petty's music swoons with a vulnerability that will leave listeners nostalgic for simpler times. A simply lovely LP.
B00006RCOB|3|Now this movie is one of he most ridiculous films about USSR I ever seen. Most russians (like me) could die from laughter while watching that one. The scenes in Soviet Union are simply hilarious. The uniforms look like WW2 British Army, the cars are mostly from the 60's (why the hell KGB agents would drive a black governments Chaika from the 60's?), the metro looks nothing like the truth plus it has a great hotel-style mensroom! I mean we moscovites are proud of our metro but this is too much. USSR looks like some stupid Evil Emprire out of Star Wars with a nice mix of Nazi Germany with KGB men asking for \\"papers\\" each 5 minutes. The funniest thing is Clint  never even cared about the actual russian translation  - bumaga is russian means just paper not documents!  All russian language used in the film (both spoken and written) is so bad that I could not understand a word. I guess real Gant would last 3 minutes with such a language not to mention the whole story of him getting in the plane is so unbelievable that I guess KGB was pretty much insulted by the way they were portrayed in the film! Now don't get me wrong I'm not a communist, but the political reality of the early 80's USSR was ... to say politely VERY different from that Nazi/Stalinist regime in the movie. Imprisoned jewish scientists - gimme a break! From one side it's histericaly funny, from the other - a bit frightening that americans back then really believed in that Evil Empire George Lucasy stereotypes.
B00A2LOAKI|5|I would say that this is a MUST SEE!!!! (if you saw the first one) I really, really enjoyed it.
076115728X|2|After one reading, my granddaughter never asked for it again, and turned it down with every offer.  It's one of those feel good books, where the concept is laudable.  But that doesn't always translate to a child's favorite.  There is no story here, no beginning, middle or ending.  If you are looking for a book that a child wants to read over and over, try these:  Princess Justina Albertina, I'd Really Like to Eat a Child, There's a Nightmare in My Closet, or The King, the Mice and the Cheese.  Or if you want to be creative and make up your own story, buy, \\"Tell Me a Story.\\"
B005LAJ212|5|It was in great shape TKS
B003H4I4JU|5|Excellent read.
B00D7Z4GQY|4|This is my second book by this author, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  The characters are sympathetic and classical tragic type-caught up in a destiny that they cannot escape. I enjoy the Aussie touch, and the incongruity of details like Easter coming during their Autumn.
B00BAXFCPO|5|My wife and I will enjoy reading this book of nutritional information. We did'nt realize how much is bad and good for the consumtion. The facts are backed up with real experiences.<br />Thank You<br />CWH
0345803485|5|I purchased Book One as a Xmas gift for my sister; Was notified it would arrive on the 27th of Dec. (gift wrapped). My sister called 12/27 very excited that the book arrived on said date. So thank you &#34;Amazon&#34;. By the way; she finished it in one day.
0385486804|5|Bought this for summer reading by one of my students. All indications / he really likes it,
B00DJFIMW6|5|this is a pretty sweet game and quite challenging. the fact that it is free free free was pretty cool too.
B008JGSM6G|5|This game is all my daughter plays and she had 423 games, she really likes it! So do I! So I g suggest that you get this game now!
B00659N39K|5|This is the perfect size for my kindergardner. It is the right size for a small backpack and holds plenty of food for lunch. We have a small freezer disk that fits under the cannister when I send lunchmeat rolls for lunch. The other two containers are great for edamame, crackers, apples, pickles, carrots, what have you.  Also, a little pricey, but it is the kid's favorite lunchbox.
B00C8S9W0G|5|Another wonderful book from Diana Gabaldon just like the rest of the Outlander series.  Worth the wait.
0451418441|3|Not nearly as good as his Pillars of the Earth.
B000002UB3|5|Abbey Road is quite simply the strongest album ever made.  Side one kicks off with &quot;Come Together&quot; which is a mean little romp through Lennon's perspective on his own life, and quickly leads into a beautiful  love song by George, &quot;Something.&quot;  This song leaves you thinking  that even though this guy's madly in love, something's just not wuite right  in the relationship.  Next come two fun tunes, &quot;Octopus's Garden&quot;  and &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot; (only the Beatles could pull off  either of these songs sucessfully) split by McCartney's vocal tour de force  &quot;Oh Darling.&quot;  A guitar jam follows (I Want You) and leaves your  adreneline pupmed for what is to follow.  Side two is a roller coaster ride  of textures, melodies and jams woven together in a magical tapestry with  hints of themes sticking with you just  barely.  When you think you've got  hold of one song you're on to another.  You can listen to this CD in the  worst of moods and when you're done you'll be in a good mood.  I promise.
B003AIEOCY|5|Thanks
0525478817|1|I bought this book because of it's incredible feedback and was so excited to read it.  Then I finished and thought...okay, and what was so great?  All the book consists of is cheesy pick up lines and overly sarcastic dialogue.  The characters are annoying, the story feels forced.  Never once did I shed a tear.  The thing is, I've never read a John Green book but I knew a lot about him and his career and this book just seems to not be playing toward his strengths.  It just isn't believable and seems very Hollywood which is something I didn't expect from Green.  For such a good writer, I expected something more moving and powerful. It is a book about cancer and yet I never felt sorry for either character.  It is a cheesy teenage love story and all their love consists of is them saying okay to each other...and that's it. Each one had a glass half-empty look on life and I just didn't care.  I will never know why people enjoy the book so much...
B00S58LCB0|5|This was a present for our Great Grand Daughter. I was very pleased with the quality and prompt delivery service.
B00NEJ7MMI|5|Love it
B000002UA2|5|This is a CD that can hold its own with many of Pink Floyd's greats--do not pass it up simply because it is a &quot;non-concept&quot; album.  It is, in fact, the last non-concept album that Pink Floyd would produce until A Momentary Lapse of Reason.  Therefore, what the listener ought to focus upon is the power of the music.  This disc really does a nice job of forecasting some of the beautiful music that will later appear on The Dark Side of the Moon.  The entire CD is underrated--and that is why I have chosen to open this review with ObC's most underrated track.<br />That, in my opinion, is &quot;Absolutely Curtains&quot;.  To be honest, it is beyond my understanding why this song seems to bother so many people.  It's quite heartwrenchingly played by Richard Wright...there's something mournful and mysterious about it that his fans would recognize from his solo song &quot;Interlude&quot;--that same feeling of standing frozen upon the edge of *something* that's about to happen, not quite knowing exactly what it is.  I know the song is credited to the entire band--but its *execution* is largely down to Mr. Wright: the song, aside from percussion and tape effects, consists entirely of a synth (VCS3?), Farfisa and Hammond organs, Rhodes and acoustic pianos.  While Pink Floyd obviously did not know what was to come, it's quite chilling to listen to this song bearing in mind that they *did* in fact stand upon the edge of an era that, while filled with great promise, would also result in great pain.  This is the very side of the music that, over time, was forced out of the music and only regained in later years.  As for the chanting, I personally find it mesmerising.<br />Another historical rarity on this album, for which it should be treasured, is the appearance of the powerful Wright-Waters songwriting team--something seen only on this album and Dark Side of the Moon.  Had Roger Waters had more respect for his opposite, this could have gone even further, as these tracksprove how perfectly they complemented each other.  Look at &quot;Burning Bridges&quot;, the best of these songs: here you have a gorgeous, memorable, and *innovative* tune, along with enchanting (not overbearing...not yet!) lyrics.  I should also point out that the mixing is the boldest for Mr. Wright's vocals to ever appear in a Pink Floyd album before the song &quot;Wearing the Inside Out&quot;, making it quite a treat on the ears.  &quot;Mudmen&quot;, the instrumental companion track to &quot;Burning Bridges&quot;, adds to Mr. Wright's gorgeous chord sequence some guitar work that might remind the listener of &quot;Time&quot; although with a backing more like &quot;Us and Them&quot;.  There is no doubt that both David Gilmour and Richard Wright were now ready for The Dark Side of the Moon.  (A bit of trivia--someone pointed out that the time signature is changed between &quot;Burning Bridges&quot; and &quot;Mudmen&quot;, a very interesting subtle sign of musical innovation.)<br />Perhaps the most *chilling* of all the predictors on this album is the lyrics to &quot;Free Four&quot;, put on a backdrop of music that is entirely too happy for the subject matter (intentional sarcasm on Mr. Waters part, I believe, similar to &quot;Corporal Clegg&quot; on A Saucerful of Secrets).  The lyrics, in a way, are a precursor to every theme that Roger Waters will dwell on in future works, particularly The Wall.  His fans will probably see this as a welcome introduction to his more serious approach to music--others may see this song as hailing the future destruction of the band.<br />&quot;When You're In&quot;/&quot;Obscured By Clouds&quot; is a quick rock instrumental opening that shows Mr. Wright's Hammond technique in fine form.  &quot;The Gold, It's In the...&quot; is perhaps the album's weak point--a track that sounds less like Pink Floyd and more like the Doobie Brothers: basically a simple rock tune, but still enjoyable enough.  &quot;Wot's uh the Deal&quot; is a very pleasant &quot;Pillow of Winds&quot;-like tune with interesting lyrics, nice vocals by David Gilmour...not THE best of the album, but very soothing and likeable.  &quot;Childhood's End&quot; is written solely by Mr. Gilmour, and while musically (except in the intro) doesn't really deviate from standard rock, it's lyrically one of his better outings, just under &quot;Sorrow&quot; and &quot;High Hopes&quot;.  &quot;Stay&quot; is the other Wright/Waters outing, and my suspicion based on the ordering of credits is that the lyrics, similar in theme to &quot;Summer '68&quot; (describing the emptiness of a one-night stand) were *mostly* written by Rick Wright himself.  My personal guess based on intuition is that the chorus is Roger Waters--the rest is Rick Wright, and his vocals are very pleasant to listen to.<br />Overall, this is a disc that all Pink Floyd fans should make sure to pick up, both for its own intrinsic qualities and for the almost prophetic way in which it indicates the future direction of the band.
B00HGJ18C2|4|Great game but would like it  if I won more  often,but I' m not as our looser.
B00003A9QI|5|When I viewed this movie, I remember liking the soundtrack a lot, but didn't really listen that closely.  I then heard an interview with Rachel Portman, the composer,  on NPR, and I remembered the music and was so enthralled by how beautifu it is.  I then purchased the soundtrack from Amazon.  If you just like beautiful, orchestral music that has some melancholy themes (but not really classical,) you will LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, this soundtrack.  It tugs and your heart.
B00L24IJCY|4|My kids loved it! The ending was definitely unforseen. Great movie though.
B003XF1XOQ|5|I liked every single part of it. I would recommend it to anybody who likes thriller books or sad books. Suzanne Collins is a genius. You should read her other series, Gregor the Overlander. Very similar and very different at the same time.
B00OMLRSPI|5|👌👍👍💜
0792842731|5|Great movie! Arrived on time.
B004O63TVS|3|It was pretty light but I like QL and JF so it was worth the $5 price. I was disappointed Bad Ass Eliot ...uh...Christian Kane was relegated to such a boring part (he does hot criminal so well).
B00E5Q1HJS|1|Too much infra-red effect.  Too much random fast action. Lacks story line from the begining.  Waste of time.  And I normally like anything trekkie!
B000683VI4|5|\\"The Notebook\\" envelops you and despite my best effort I became completely and totally submerged in the film.  This is a movie that makes you believe in love again.  So many of the stories we hear about in the news today are stories of hate and violence.  This movie does a fabulous job of taking you out of that world for two hours and making you understand that true love still can exist. The story follows Noah and Allie from their young life together as teenagers until their death together in a nursing home bed.  This is touching especially since in our world today divorce is becoming commonplace.  I realize that it seems like I think the world is some horrible and sad place but I really think the opposite.  Having a movie such as this to watch can remind us of the positive when we might be overwhelmed by the negative. When I first saw the film, I had not yet read the book by Nicholas Sparks.  I think it is interesting because the book opens with both main characters, Noah and Allie dying, but the movie ends that way. I think I would have been disappointed by knowing the ending first in the movie because this removes the feeling of suspense.  Despite that main difference both pieces (the film and novel) mirrored each other.  Why change something that is so great?
B0094BB4TW|5|great way to comunicate and keep in touch, and find friends.  also love the cat and dog pictures and different way to find things
B004Q1FDHO|5|this game is very addicting! It is fairly Simple to figure out but fun! Does freeze sometimes. Good for passing time
B00B2G2RG6|5|super performance by all actors. Kept me on the edge of my seat and wanting more. There was a shock during each episode. Hope next season is just as good.
B0074D3CAQ|5|Harold's pilgrimage encourages those of us of a similar age to look back on our own lives.  It left a feeling of hope<br />that 20 years of misery and misunderstanding could be swept away by an impulsive decision.
B0054JZC6E|3|Well I just downloaded the app and so far so good. No complaints.....Totally fun when your bored.....It is so easy to win points to get access to another.....
B007V2UGPE|5|its the most amazing game I have ever played on my kindle fire who ever wants to get this game don't wait get it now
B005MMJ84K|3|The second book starts by drawing into the wilds n it's world. But then slowly it turns cheesy and at times trying to push things to happen. Usually when I like a book I really want to finish it to see what happens, but with this book I just wanted it to finish.
B00AREIAI8|4|This is a great game.  Very realistic and fun.  My daughter loves this game and I do as well. I can't seem to put this game down!!
1476753164|5|This story…it’s an experience. There are two parts to this fictional endeavor and you can’t have one without the other, you really can’t. So if you haven’t done it, get the Maybe Someday soundtrack with the songs by Griffin Peterson and make sure you’ve got it cued to play along when the songs appear in the book. You won’t be disappointed.<br />I’m not sure this story would have spoken to me on the level it did if I hadn’t had the music playing at the same time. When I say it’s an experience I mean it. Full body one no less. You know that all over complete feeling you get when you read or hear or experience something that’s perfectly right? I had that with this entire book. Never once did the feeling change and I can’t even begin to say how thankful I am for it.<br />This book was an escape, but not one that was so out there that you can escape entirely. It’s real, it’s raw and it will attach itself to your heartstrings and pull until there is nothing left inside you.<br />I was not as affected as I should have been by the beginning. Sydney finding out that her boyfriend had cheated on her and with her best friend no less, just from her own words, her own thoughts as it related to the way she saw them in the future, it meant that them breaking up didn’t even make me blink. Getting past that part though and every instance that came next, all I did was feel.<br />I won’t say anything more about this book because I’m not the reviewer that comes in and gives away the plot points or regurgitates the blurb on the back of the book. What I will say is, whether you are a fan of Colleen Hoover or you aren’t, you need to read this book. You need to experience every single facet of this book and you need to lose yourself in it.<br />I wasn’t sure that anything could touch me the way Hopeless did when I read it ages ago, but this did and I have a feeling that no matter where I go, what I read next, it will be with me forever. It’s a love story so real it can never be forgotten.<br />To both Colleen and Griffin, thank you for the experience and most of all, for sharing it with the world. This really was a life changing read. Wow. Absolutely phenomenal.<br />Excuse me while I go cry now.tory so real it can never be forgotten.<br />To both Colleen and Griffin, thank you for the experience and most of all, for sharing it with the world.

B00HBR9OWU|2|Very slow moving might be nice for kids have to wait to long to be able to cut down trees and expand
B005DD7H50|4|This is for sure a better entertainer of the 2011 lot. Bradley Cooper suits the character well. Though fans like me would expect more from a great actor like DeNiro. His role in the movie was short and not so powerful as his introduction shows. With so less characters, the director has managed to keep the pace which is a commendable effort. This movie gets its place besides other brain based thrillers like Inception and the like. Go watch it if you like fiction.
B00000JMOF|5|Great movie, has always been a favorite, good quality. I would recommend this product and seller. Buy the combination DVD with 3 movies for the same price.
B001EO748M|4|Good series.
B000002BHE|5|worth it
B005R9HK8O|5|For me personally, The most important book of the &#34;20th Century&#34;
B007ZGO7EM|5|Has everything you need for day to day tasks.
B00AFROVQC|5|Was hooked from start to finish. Can't wait to start on the second book. Would recommend this book to anyone interested in fantasy.
B003ITZBVI|5|I owned this animated adventure on DVD but I had to add it to my collection as a Blueray.  The movie is much more vivid and the audio is fantastic on my system.  I have viewed Batman: Under the Red Hood about 50 times and it gets better after each viewing.  As it pertains to story line, action, adventure, pain, suffering, guilt, love and a host of other emotions, this movie is perfect.  The voice over actors' interpretation of the scenes is so full of emotional context.  You will never regret adding this movie to your collection.  In fact, I do not know why they have not gathered this team together again for a sequel or to depict another epic adventure by Batman.<br /><br />As you watch this movie, remember that Batman (Bruce Wayne) could be The Red Hood at any time.  Therefore, the Red Hood is an extension of who Batman could have been.  Also, Nightwing (Mr. Chatty) is the person Batman desires to be as a person.  This was a perfect contrast of characters.<br /><br />Buy this MOVIE!!!!
B000MRAAJM|4|Well I bought the DVDs and they looked so bad compared to what I watched on HDTV that I broke down and bought a blu-ray player and this set on Blu-ray. By all means buy it if you like nature documentaries. I've watched some episodes twice already and was not bored. Anyway, they look great too, but there is no reason that for even more money than the DVDs they don't include the extras. The 10 minute docs after each episode are wonderful and show you what the film teams went through. Literally days of hiding out in a tent just to get a few minutes of the birds of paradise footage. Well you'll have to rent the DVDs to see it all if you buy these. Are they really 25GB discs? If so, that is even more lame and makes it more inexcusable not to use 50GB and inlcude all the extras. You could buy these and not know what you're missing on the DVDs. Unfortunately, you'll be missing a lot.

1607747308|4|This books truly is an eye-opener, and my room has never been cleaner than it is right now! I love the Konmari way of folding clothes, and I have far more space in my closet and drawers. I don't know about you guys, but one thing I will say is this was NOT a day project for me. It actually took a few days. Be sure you have a weekend set aside, or a few days to get everything in order. Other than that, I definitely recommend this book.

B007TBZ63Y|5|Greek and Roman mythology lovers would enjoy reading about Percy and Jason learning on how to work as a team instead of handling every minor quests by themselves. This book shows how some members copes with the fears they grew up with and how they overcome their phobias. The reader can easily visualize every task and scenes that the young demigods faces throughout the book. Can't wait until the next book comes out.
B0015519VS|3|After multiple listens of Usher's lastest album Here I Stand, I honestly like it. Before when it was first released and I took a listen I didnt care for it simply because I probably did with so many people did, compared it to 8701 and Confessions...Which is a big NO-NO because this album is on a whole different playing field.<br /><br />I had doubts about this album when I first heard \\"Love in this club\\", I was like \\"huh\\" (scratching my head) wondering why Usher would release a song talking about \\"Love\\" in a club, beats me. But anyway recently I heard the two songs \\"Appetite\\" & \\"Before I Met You\\" and simply fell in love. I decided to give the album another chance. Lyrically, vocally, and production wise this album is very good and it shows Usher's growth. Even though there's still some areas that could be worked on but its nothing to major.<br /><br />Ratings of tracks on a 10point scale:<br /><br /> 1. Intro<br /> 2. Love In This Club - (featuring Young Jeezy) (6/10) For a single I guess it served its purpose.<br /> 3. This Ain't Sex  (6/10) I like the production, lyrically I'm not fond of the song.<br /> 4. Trading Places (7/10) Took a few listens, but I like.<br /> 5. Moving Mountains (10/10) This song always touches me especially toward the end<br /> 6. What's Your Name - (featuring Will.I.Am) (5/10) I normally don't skip this song but its not a song I would put on repeat.<br /> 7. Prayer For You (Interlude)(5/10) Cute, its fits the album since its mostly about parent hood, marriage and growth.<br /> 8. Something Special (5/10) Nice song but nothing I would put on repeat<br /> 9. Love You Gently (10/10)<br /> 10. Best Thing - (featuring Jay-Z) (7/10) Everything on this song fits, just not a favorite of mines.<br /> 11. Before I Met You (10/10)<br /> 12. His Mistakes  (10/10)<br /> 13. Appetite  (10/10) The song that made me re-listen to the album<br /> 14. What's A Man To Do  (9/10)<br /> 15. Lifetime (8/10)<br /> 16. Love In This Club Part II - (featuring Lil Wayne/Beyonce) (7/10) Like the guest appearances, especially Beyonce.<br /> 17. Here I Stand (6/10) Not to fond of the song-but it works, like the melody and arrangement though<br /> 18. Will Work For Love (7/10) Love the lyrics but its not as catchy as I would want it<br /><br />Top Tracks:<br />Appetite<br />Before I met you<br />Love you gently<br />Moving Mountains<br />His Mistakes<br /><br />Grade: 127/170=74% C<br /><br />Overall this album is very different from his others and it should be. He has grown and made changes in his life and this album reflects that. But I am looking for the next album to have a little of the old Usher in there.ly Beyonce.   17.

0486266885|5|\\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is assured a place in the history of horror fiction because it the literary classic that represents the archetype of the werewolf (the human with the hiding inside).  Along with Mary Wollstonecraft's \\"Frankenstein\\" (the Thing Without a Name) and Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" (the Vampire) Robert Louis Stevenson's novella is part of the gothic foundation of the modern horror story.  All have in common the fact that they promise to tell a story that might best be left untold, which, of course, is exactly the sort of story we want to hear.<br />Given that Stevenson was writing when the genre of horror fiction was not recognized as such, it is surprising that \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is cast in the form of a mystery novel.  Stevenson invites his readers to try and get ahead of the story, to put the clues together and come to the conclusion.  Today it is nearly impossible to pick up this story and not know the \\"secret,\\" but if you think back to the late 19th-century when this story was written you can get a sense for how Stevenson used the biases and limitations of his readers to his advantage in keeping them from what we might consider to be an obvious conclusion.<br />More importantly, Stevenson is writing several decades before the writings of Sigmund Freud revolutionized the whole idea of human psychology.  Yet we can certainly find evidence of the conscious and subconscious mind of which Freud would write.  Stevenson reinforces this metaphor with the block of buildings that divides this particular part of London, with one side representing the civilized world of a respected physician and the other side the squalor of the world inhabited by an inhuman creature who gives in to his every earthly desire.  The novella also speaks to the topic of evolution, with Hyde being described as \\"ape-like,\\" reinforcing the idea that our most human attributes remove us ever further from the category of mere animal.<br />Of the three classic horror novels, \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is the most accessible.  Not only because of its shorter length, but also because its evil is more realistic, even in terms of our imagination.  We might be unable to reanimate the dead or to become the walking dead, but we can certainly relate to the idea of unleashing the beast buried with us.  Even if we could not, we can recognize the \\"werewolf\\" in the real world in the form of serial killers who try to show a civilized face to us in public.  This is not to say that the novella is simplistic, for Stevenson offers a sophisticated narrative.  If this is one of those literary you have never read because you already know the story, then you should take out an evening to sit down and finally get around to reading it.Of the three classic horror novels, \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is the most accessible.

B00C8S9W0G|5|OMG!  I have read and re-read many times all of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander books.  This newest one does NOT disappoint.  My only warning is, they are not thrown together willy nilly and you will be in for a wait between each one.  They are BIG books and I tried my best to read slowly.  That didn't work for me with any of these.  I can't wait to get to the end to see what all the characters are doing and then want to start over again.<br />If you like historical fiction, especially if you happen to be lucky enough to be a Scot...you will love these books.  When I first discovered them, I had a lot of catching up to do.  Now when I re-read them from the beginning, I always find something I'd missed.<br />Mrs. Gabaldon researches her books so well that I've found myself wanting to know more about the history of the era and have done a lot of reading of the actual histories.  I have a much better understanding of how my ancestors lived during their lives in olden times.<br />I love to read, but Diana Gabaldon is one of the few authors that can make me laugh out loud and cry with her characters.  If you haven't yet tried the Outlander books, you are missing out on some great adventures and wonderful well crafted stories.<br />I am impatiently waiting for the Starz new upcoming Outlander series that will start this month.  Due to the fact that Diana G seems to be happy with their treatment of her works, I am sure that they will do a good job with them.  I'm only worried that, like the books, they won't last nearly long enough.<br />Even if you've not read the preceding books, each one can stand alone, but you won't want to miss any of them.
0345298349|5|Many writers today find a successful formula and stick to it... over and over. The only thing the same from Martin Cruz Smith's works are their high level of excitement, interesting characters  and plot development. Gorky Park is Smith's BEST work to date. What he does best is gives the reader an insiders' view of a society totally different than what the audience is used to. And introduces his characters to his readers as if we had been their friends (or enemies) for years.<BR>Whether it be Los Alamos during the development of Man's deadliest weapon in Stallion Gate, Cuba in Havana Bay, Japan in December 4th: A Novel, or Moscow in Gorky Park, with his characters on the verge of an exciting adventure for the reader to be a part of. <BR>I enjoy Smith's books. Gorky Park is THE mystery novel I judge all other mysteries and mystery writers by. Some mysteries I consume like potato chips or pretzels. Very, VERY few do I savor each page as I did Gorky Park!<br />John Row

Each episode focuses on different individuals within the group while leading you through their journey from training, to D-Day, to the end of the war in Europe. the quality of filmmaking is superb, and the heart behind the story is engaging, from beginning to end.

B00FMQINEM|5|This is amazing for the price. I expected something sub-par, and reading the reviews thought I would have to get an engineer involved in the application. It was so super simple to put up, and looks super professional. Since the 'body' of the sticker comes in 4-6 pieces, I suggest starting with the bottom half of the main part of Elsa (this is what I ultimately ended up doing after I started with her head and worked down. I took it all off and started again with the bottom half of the skirt to make sure I got it even.). Most of the pieces are snowflakes, so you can place those wherever you'd like. I would certainly buy again, this is a great product!
B000GG4ZKO|5|Fabulous book! You will not be able to stop untill you finish the whole book. The main idea is very much like in Celestine Prophecy, The Secret, and What the bleep do we know. In short, it is about learning ones purpose in life, in finding ones way. When we live doing what we really want to do, we are living our Historia Personal. To know what to do, one only has to know what one desires to do, for through our desires we learn about our personal way, the point of our existence.<br /><br />The books talks about the biggest lie of all: That human life is determined by destiny and there is nothing we can do to change it. Meanwhile we are the only ones who determines our destiny. There is no limit to what one can do. As young people we know exactly what we want and believe that everything is possible but as we get older we change our mind because every day we are hearing from people that this is not true.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book greatly and highly recommend it to all
0553212540|5|In books, magazines, television, etc. in the English-speaking world, we often come across references made to Oscar Wilde, as many people quote his witty sayings and lines.  Having come across so many of these references and quotations myself, I was hesitant to pick up any of his works, assuming that to understand and appreciate Wilde I would have to be some kind of a literary scholar. Let me set the record straight: this is definitely not the case at all, as Oscar Wilde is very down to earth and easy to understand.<br /><br />He is a gifted writer and I understand now why people quote him so much. He's a master at putting thoughts to pen and paper so ingeniously. After I found out for myself what he was all about, I regret that I never read his books earlier. I picked up this book that included various works and I was truly amazed at his genius. He interlaces humor with the heavy so cleverly.<br /><br />In all of his works you can easily identify a so-called \\"dandy\\", a male character whose one role is to make flippant but ironically true remarks to the dismay of stuffy characters. The quotes we so often see or hear are usually remarks uttered by one of Wilde's dandies. Offering tongue-in-cheek humor with wholehearted honesty, Wilde called a spade, a spade but could so with such brilliant wit. Oh if only I could be even half as gifted with the pen!<br /><br />I am not going to write about any plots of the stories and plays, as other readers have done that already. I simply wanted to say that if you have never read anything by Wilde, I highly recommend you do. I am confidant you will enjoy.  You could end up like me, frantically longing to get your hands on as much of his writing as you can.

B0035G9ABQ|3|Other reviewers have mentioned a lack of coherency and I couldn't agree more...it feels like a random mix of rap songs with almost no singular artistic vision. Guests make up the vast majority of the CD. It's not a bad hip hop record in its own right but Gorillaz fans will likely be disappointed by how little presence \\"the Gorillaz\\" seem to have on their own CD.     To get a real taste of The Gorillaz pick up Demon Days. Plastic Beach has a couple really good Gorillaz songs but overall it's rather forgettable. It's almost as if Damon Albarn wanted to make a new solo CD but, in an effort to make it sell, forced a couple Gorillaz songs into it so he could call it a \\"Gorillaz album.\\"     I realize this group's always had its own style but this album just doesn't feel like them....though several songs are quite good, nothing reaches the heights of Feel Good Inc or the Demon Days song off their last  CD.     Many Gorillaz fans will wonder what they've purchased. It's worth a listen or two but don't expect it to live up the the band you know and love.

B00051E906|4|This is a simple lightweight instrument. Made in Russia. Easy to use. Does not tick or beep with each count, only when a theshold is crossed in terms of counts.  <br />I gave it a 4 instead of 5 because the manual seems to have been written by someone with a Russian/English dictionary who had one semester of English. But it was understandable. It also did not have any information on how to interpet the readings.  <br />Not a professional instrument but good for someone who wants to be prepared for a local nuclear accident or terroist attack. Peace of mind. I tested it by holding it near a smoke detector and it worked!
B000FGFBEE|3|Just watched this movie tonight on DVD after many years since my last viewing (when I never paid much attention anyhow while it was on TV).  I read the book a few months ago and rated it 4.5 stars.  The book was much better.  Perhaps if there was no book, the movie would rate higher having nothing to compare it too.  I'm not sure why this movie is considered one of the best films ever made.  Maybe it's a classic by Hollywood standards for its place and time and some of the actors involved, but it's lightweight when compared to the book (perhaps an inevitability).  Is it worth a watch?  Certainly.  But please, read the book, too.  It's better... much better.  As for the movie, if you can get past the fact that the location scenery (despite its beauty) is all wrong and that the lead Indian is played by a white guy, then it gets four stars.  The extras on the second DVD are very good.  For overall entertainment value I rate the entire package four stars.  But the movie itself gets three stars.

B005NKIQ26|5|Definitely not your usual Justin Bieber groupie, I heard Justin's first holiday tune 'Only Thing I Ever Get For Christmas' on AOL Radio and decided, right then and there, to order this CD.  Always on the look out for innovative, upbeat interpretations on holiday classics, Justin's fresh, clear tone versions are not only fun to listen to, but engaging.      The BIG surprise of the holiday is that I absolutely loved this CD.  I'm a picky,  musically enlightened 60 year old who enjoys finger-snappin, toe-tappin' qualities in song and dance.  This CD promises to elicit bouncy, rhythmic pop tunes that entices one to karoake-out or get up and move.  Young Justin seems incredibly comfortable and composed singing with featured artists; from Usher to Mariah Carey, his chameleon like voice seems to meld beautifully with the various performers that accompany him.  And what's more? There are bold surprises in the mix. The unexpected rendition of 'Drummer Boy' featured with Busta Rhymes will have you up on your feet movin' and groovin' to a song you never thought would encourage snappin' and tappin'.  It reminded me of Michael Jackson's driving anthem, 'They Don't Really Care About Us'; definitely, a different spin on a classic.   'All I Want For Christmas Is You' is a happy, festive take on the song originally attributed to the movie hit, 'Love Actually'. Additionally, there's a Justin-spin on a country pop tune featuring The Band Perry that is both charming and holiday-spirited.    There are several songs that feature Justin at his melodic, pure-tone best that boast cool, up beat pop tunes.  However, the song that truly astonished me for its engaging, poignant rendition of a holiday classic was Justin's last featured song, 'Silent Night'; his version will startle you in its simplicity, if not touch a soft spot in your heart.  This CD, in my mind, has it all; from pop to R&B to new country, Justin, Usher, Boyz II Men, Mariah, Busta Rhymes and Band Perry have successfully contributed to the creation of an enjoyable, 'young at heart' 2011 holiday CD. Well done!

It was fun and positively humorous, but not and A+ movie, not even \\"Airplane\\" funny, more like.....well, a serious movie with \\"trying to be funny\\" like..........dang wut movie is ALMOST funny....anyway, you get my drift, a perfect one timer if you've got nothing else to do......except drink a few and laugh at this movie.....

0790730960|2|Tim Burton's worst movie, hands down. It's visually interesting, but that's about all. Batman himself seems like a secondary character in this sequel, and unfortunately I couldn't get into Danny Devito very much. He  plays the role well, I suppose, but the story is awfully flimsy and there  just isn't much to latch onto here. I will say that Michelle Pfiefer ... oh  my ... I had a crush on her for months after seeing this for the first  time. And it isn't just the skin-tight leather outfit (although it sure  helped.) My. But in any case, watching her was the only redeemable  distraction I could find in this disappointingly poor movie.

0307275639|5|This book is powerful indeed. I shied away from it for years because I thought it would be too depressing. However, it wasn't the heartwrenching tale I expected. Some of it is comforting, a few things made me laugh, and certainly it is inspirational. I am inspired by Morrie's courage, honesty, and generous spirit. He has indeed made me rethink my priorities in life. What a great thesis.

B00BESM14U|3|I enjoyed this quirky coming of age story and the compassion and support the main characters actually demonstrated with one another. It was a positive and reassuring teenage story.
B003008RWA|4|I watched this movie for my Bioethics class.<br />I found many answers for my questions in class.<br />It is documented movie but really interesting.<br />I will watch it again for my future career in health care.
B007IXWKUK|5|Thoroughly enjoyable.  Have to read all three books.  Ready to read again.  Too bad there were only three books in series.
0061684384|5|I got this as a gift for my wife, as she is an avid Kat Von D fan. The book is excellently done, with interesting background facts and tons of cool pictures. She loved it...
B008XG1X18|5|this site is great. it had given me lots of ideas for my classroom and recipes for new and exciting dinners. love it
B004FRX0MY|5|Amazon MP3 down load makes it easy to find the music, easy to buy either the album or just a single song and they make it easy to down load the music to my phone or pc.
B003YL4LYI|5|This Series is amazing!  I wish all books could be written this well, and all twists this dramatic.  Good thing they aren't though, or I would never get anything done.  Everyone should read this series!  EVERYONE!
B008C1O8CA|4|I have to admit that I was really skeptical when Green day announced that they would be releasing three albums in short succession.  I was wrong to worry.  This is Green Day as you know and love them.  Whether you're primarily a fan of Dookie or American Idiot, it doesn't matter.  This is Green Day in very fine form.  If you're a fan, this is a must have.

0345404475|1|We are told below that this \\"one of the best books ever written by man\\", comparable presumably, then, to The Odyssey, The Bible, Canterbury Tales, Hamlet, Don Quixote, Walden, Critique of Pure Reason, The Sun Also Rises, and The Unbearable Lightness of Being. Let's assume, however, out of hand, for the sake of argument, that it really is \\"one of the best books ever written by man\\": How does it compare to the best books written ever by rooster, drake, or bull (speaking of bull)? What? Was its author awarded the Nobel Prize in Quasi-literate B Science-fiction Pulp? Is this a new category? Let's assume, however, out of hand, for the sake of argument, that it really is worthy of a Nobel Prize in Quasi-literate B Science-fiction Pulp: Wouldn't you still rather read the back of your box of Fruit Loops? (Or, for the that matter, the side panel listing ingredients?) I know I would -- that is, if I actually ate Fruit Loops.
B00DHKKN6Q|4|I love the game and play it all the time. I only give it 4 Stars, because if you lose a level, you lose a life and have to wait almost 2 hours to gain them back, and you need a number of stars to unlock new playing fields. I love this game and totally recommend it!!
B0054JZC6E|4|pretty good games. and what makes its better is that there are different game. not too crazy about the updates. but still doesn't take from the game

B000BHHVPO|5|My husband and I were at the London concert. It was amazing. I could not believe when I won the tickets to attend. Me, some crazy American, participating in history. I am anxious to see if we made it into the footage, as I gleefully waved to every camera I saw. I'm just glad no one filmed me falling down a flight of stairs at the subway station(hee-hee).
B00BSBR9N6|5|This is one of the funniest books I've read in a long time.  Don reminds me so much of Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory  on T.V., but Don is even funnier.  Rosie is also a delightful character who wins Don's heart, even though she is everything Don says he doesn't want in a wife, but she is absolutely perfect for him.  What a clever story.  Be sure to read The Rosie Effect as well.  I thought the second book couldn't be any funnier, but it is delightful too.  Hope there are more in this series.
6303014100|5|GETTYSBURG By Mike Ray<br />One of the most difficult problems that movie producers face in making a historical  movie, whether it be in Hollywood or elsewhere, is the concept of  truthfulness and believability.  Many  producers and directors feel no responsibility to treat the subject matter  that they are presenting in a truthful or honest way. Some feel that they  are at liberty, and have a license to slant the movie any way that may suit  their cause. Others lack this dedication to the truth simply because they   don't do their research.<br />So, it is very rare indeed when a production  company chooses an ambitious historical setting that still burns in the  hearts of many Americans, (The Civil War) and sets out, not only to make an  epic movie, but to tell the truth at the same time.<br />The Movie Gettysburg  would not have been possible without the efforts of three men: Michael  Sharer, author of the book, \\"The Killer Angels\\" - the foremost novel about  the three days of Gettysburg , July 1, through July 3, 1863; director  Ronald Maxwell, who after reading Sharer's book said, \\"I must bring this  story to the screen.\\"; and TV giant Ted Turner, who put up the financing to  make this movie. <br />This remarkable team was determined that not only was  the message of both sides (North and South) to be presented openly and  honestly, but they were also willing to spend whatever it took to make the  setting as historically accurate as possible. This was to be a huge  undertaking. Maxwell came up with the idea of using Civil War Reenactors.  (These are people who have studied the war for years, and stage  reenactments of Civil War Battles every spring and summer) They not only  have the authentic uniforms of the day, but all of the accouterments that  go with it - i.e. rifles, powder, flints, tobacco pouches etc. - right down  to the smallest detail.  Another plus for the production company, was that  each reenactor knew the battle of Gettysburg like the back of their hand.  Many of their ancestors fought in this battle. It was a part of their  lives. Each man (about five thousand) were paid $10 a day, fed beans  and  cornbread, and slept outdoors in either tents or bed rolls. They enjoyed   being at the historical location, and all that went with it - like  mosquitoes, and no running water. Many of them thanked God for the  opportunity to be a part of something that would honor their forefathers.  Many of the stars in the movie were touched by the spirit and dedication  that these men brought to this production. It was very special.<br />The  producers receive very high marks for making sure that the philosophical  under pinning of each side was presented fairly and accurately. The South  felt that the Constitutional convention of 1789 gave them the right of  self-government. They felt the states were joined together \\"only\\" for the  sake of a unified military to fight off foreign aggressors, and for a  common currency. They believed they could leave the union at any time, and  for any reason. Since Washington DC was meddling in the affairs of the  Sovereign States, the South, led by South Carolina, felt that for the sake  of their sovereignty they should split from the Union. The North was  fighting to preserve the Union. It was Lincoln's strong conviction that  once a member, always a member. A \\"divided nation\\" could never stand he  said. Officially, slavery did not become an issue until January 1, 1863  with Lincoln's emancipation proclamation. This subject is dealt with fairly  and honestly, with both sides presenting their own unique  perspective.<br />The story revolves around 3 major characters, General Robert  E. Lee of the South (played by Martin Sheen), General James Longstreet of  the South (played by Tom Berenger), and Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlin  of the North (played by Jeff Daniels From Coldwater, Michigan) and  supporting roles from dozens of others. This movie does an outstanding job  of introducing oneimportant character after another, without losing any  momentum.<br />As the movie begins, General Lee, the beloved leader of the  ragtag South has piled up one impressive upset after another. His  incredible victories at Fredricksburg, and Chancellorsville has made him a  legend. His men are outnumbered, under clothed, and underfed, but seem to  find a way to lay up one important victory after another. Lee, despite his  success, has grown tired of the bloodshed and the carnage and wants the War  to end. He believes that a victory at Gettysburg will give him a clear road  to Washington DC. In fact, a declaration letter of  victory written  by  Jefferson Davis has been prepared for Lee to give to Lincoln, when and if  they can make it past the army of the Potomac. Lee's determination to end  the war quickly, and his false sense that his men are invincible, will lead  him to a tragic mistake.<br />General Longstreet is Lee's aid who is loyal,  and smart. It is he who has developed a brilliant defensive campaign, and  tries desperately to convince Lee that an offensive attack against the  better equipped North will fail.<br />Colonel Chamberlin,  a Philosophy  teacher from Bowden College in Maine, is a reluctant and unpretentious hero  who leads an incredible, seldom used, bayonet attack against General Oats  and his Alabama brigade. That move of desperation keeps the South from  taking the high ground, and makes a southern victory in this small  Pennsylvania town impossible.<br />This is more than a movie about a war, or  about a cause. It's also about people. Maxwell puts heart and soul to the  characters. He has made them real. You find yourself caring about them  (both sides). You sense that in the middle of every battle many of the  soldiers come to the realization that in a few short minutes, they will be  standing before their maker. The emotion, at times, is  overwhelming.<br />Gettysburg is an unforgettable movie. Randy Eldelmans  dramatic musical rendition isone of the best film scores of the last 35  years. His music and director Ronald Maxwell's film are a wonderful  marriage. This movie does our ancestors justice.  It honors their beliefs,  their courage, their sacrifice and their memory. It is the greatest motion  picture I have ever seen.
B001OBT3FC|5|Excellent
B00005JKQX|5|I'm not much of a Russell Crowe fan, but went to see this movie because I had heard so many good things about it.  I knew this movie was a true story about a brilliant man, but I didn't know anymore than that.  I instantly got sucked into the story, which made the movie so enjoyable.  I laughed, I cried, and I felt every emotion in between.  I have recommended this movie to everyone I know.
0385737955|5|loved the book
B0002VFXFE|5|My CPU + stock fan would overheat alot. I had used the free crap that came on the bottom of the heat sink, and it didn't work. Rebounded the same fan with some of this paste instead, and average temp under load went down by about 8 degrees Celsius. Good buy.
0345529057|5|I'd never even heard of these books before I started seeing the billboards all over the city for the HBO special. I am so thrilled that I remembered to dvr this when I got home. I was half way through the tv series before I had to buy the books. I can not remember ever reading a book and watching a tv show simultameously. This is one of the most brilliant books/series of books I've ever read. Some have compared to The Lord of the Rings, some have compared to The Once and Future King...I have read them and many other of these types of books that can loosely be called similar, but I can compare this to nothing I've read previously. Perhaps - maybe - possibly - remotely - the Harry Piotter books only in the comparison of making a total and complete creation of another/aternate world, but one you feel utterly comfortable in from the first page. There is no new vocabulary to learn no new words to describe things (mostly they are spelling changes - but you get the idea immediately)and no strange creatures or languages that most fantasy books frankly, make you learn before you become comfortable with the books. From the first page you are comfortabley sucked in immediately and must continue to read until you get to the end. I highly recommend to anyone who likes a good, long, complicated but engaging yarn. Get a blanket, curl up by the fire - winter is coming - and you'll have a lot of reading to do!
B0010ZR160|5|Who would have thought Ben Affleck had talent?  As someone who is currently working a missing child case, I can tell you this is a most realistic movie. It stretches a bit with who ultimately did it (no spoilers) in the end, but the fuzzy line between right and wrong, what is good and evil, and what should be and what should not be done is done with finess and reality without any fancy action hero type silliness. The use of actual people from the street vs actors helped, and the real actors do a great job in keeping with character. Shows Missing Child stories aren't always so simple or so easy.   [...]
031606792X|5|After reading the reviews I was not sure I would like Breaking Dawn but I loved it!!!  Let's not forget this is a Fantasy/Paranormal Love Story.  I think the saga showed Bella mature from a wall flower teenage girl to a beautiful woman-vampire, which I could relate to and I am sure a lot of others can and will be able to.  It showed Edward more of a man-vampire not a super hero.  You may not be able to pick your family but family is family and not all and every family can get along with each other werewovles, vampire or most of all human families.  The birthing scene did not gross me out at all, yes it would have been nice had they gone to Dartmouth for a year but how boring would that be to read?  The baby added a little more of what are the consequenses of your actions.  I loved meeting all the other Vampire familes which people seemed to leave out of the reviews I read.  I was totally surpised by that and loved them.  I most of all am glad for a happy ending.  It made me feel good. It's good to have a happy ending even though life may not give you the happiness you seek but what else does one have without hope. Enjoy this book.  I had one problem - what is a nudger? I have never heard of that word referred to a baby before.
B00KY7PEAA|5|Loved it super game only think I have is it cuts off maybe 2 times a weeks on my kindle fire. I still say everyone should get this game. on my iPhone it works fine.

B009FZHYKU|5|Love it, love it, love it......enjoy the show....been watching since the beginning.  If you have not got into Zombies this will get you hook!
B005COO1X6|4|Very good.  This is what I like.  It kept me guessing.  I was wishing it to be a longer story though.
0618918248|4|I like the book because it is very witty and opens your mind into things that you have not thought about...  I like the beginning of the book when the writer talks about Einstein..and also I like the part when he discusses the crimes found in the Bible...there is also another good part when he explains why terrorists in Islamic countries become terrorists...  On the whole it is a good book...yet there are some parts that I did not like...for example the abortion part..I don't know I feel that this topic has been given more than it requires...
B00II5YUIW|5|Challenging and engaging. The hidden object puzzles were varied as were the mini games. I would definitely recommend this game and am going to get another of theirs to play!
B00328R21C|5|Our seven year old grandson,Leo, has been an avid LEGO builder for two years -- not duplo. He puts together very intricate constructs that literally blow my mind. Yet, he LOVES this little landspeeder -- put it together quickly and called me in to see its features. The major draw, it seems, is the five little Star Wars figures. His thank you note says: \\"I realey, realey loved the Lego landspeeder. I play with it a lot. I realey like R2-d2 and C-PO! The landspeeder has a storage area. Love, Leo\\"
B00JVZ0DQG|4|It's fun and the kids love it..easy to play and easy for the kids to get around and figure things out
B00EMXBDMA|4|The same way that the new Sherlock reboots Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes to the present day, Andy Weir's \\"The Martian\\" reboots Robinson Crusoe (and Caataway, and  ...) to now. Instead of a sailor trapped on an island, we have a hacker -- both physical and computer -- trapped on a planet. It's sort of MacGyver Crusoe in Space.    Weir's book is all sorts of things: Propulsive plot-driven in Crichton style, compulsively analytical, and, dare I say it, funny.Yes, funny.    My main criticisms, such as they are, are that the book's relentless cataloguing of gas mixtures and duct-taped solutions to problems can become overwhelming, but ... just skip some of that stuff. I did, and the book lost nothing in the skipping. Second, the characters all kind of either blend into one another or are awfully clichéd -- Can-Do Insouciant Astronauts! NASA Bureacrats! Bookish Geeks With The Solution!.    But ... those criticisms are pointless. You know, that's not really why you're reading this book anyway. You're reading it find out of MacGyver successfully ... MacGyves on the big stage Weir sets out for him,\\" Mars, with the world watching .
B00IKZX1ZI|5|love it
B00BMKDTNC|4|The only reason I read this stupid book was to be done with this god forsaken series once and for all.  I hate the character and wish the authors would have killed off more.<br /><br />I usually talk about trash sci-fi and trash fantasy stuff and give it high ratings.  This is trash, but not in the good way.  It takes effort to read this stuff, it does not entertain and it generally just leaves me in a foul mood after reading it.  Feist is entertaining and sparks the imagination, Gibson is entertaining and sets the imagination on fire, Brett (Warded Man) leaves you wanting more.  This leaves you wondering if you have somehow been captured by the Dark Lord and are being tortured.  Only the Dark Lord himself wouldn't make the forsaken read this crap.<br /><br />The reason for the 4 stars?  Because it's over.  Done.  No more!  Raise your voice in celebration.

B000003S16|3|Exposure is a disconcerting, wild ride through the mind of Robert Fripp, produced and realized during a time when all eyes were on him in high expectation. He passed the test with this collection of oddball tracks,  highlighted by Fripp's reworking of Daryl Hall into one of the best rock  screechers ever. Exposure was conceived as part of a trilogy of Fripp  influenced recordings, along with Hall's solo LP Sacred Songs, and Peter  Gabriel II. However, try a Fripp quadruplicity for a total  &quot;experience,&quot; in the following order:  Peter Gabriel II;  Exposure; Sacred Songs; Peter Gabriel I.
B00008BXJG|5|The ULTIMATE rock album.  More or less the album that put the nail in disco's coffin.  Those of us who needed a new power rock band in the late 70's got it with HTH.  This album will run up your blood pressure and make you want to go wild. Always put this album on when I used to get ready to go out to party worked just right.  Now older but stills gets me going again!  Few albums in rock stand out over the years and this is one of them for sure.  To bad we lost Bon Scott so early on.  Brian Johnson a good replacement for sure, but Bon is the one.  An album misunderstood by the title but so good on the music and every song is a keeper.  If your a AC/DC fan this is the must have to your collection even more so than Back in Black which is a good album.  HTH in the car full blast on a sunny day nothing could be better !!!
B00JP5ONY0|3|This was recommended to me by a friend who enjoyed it thoroughly. I found it slow moving in the beginning and actually didn't finish watching.
B00E8KLWB4|4|If you like hidden object games I recommend you do this one. It has a great story line and several different ways to find objects in the pictures.
B007SGLZP8|4|Suspenseful and intriguing. Never a dull moment. Very interesting story! Twists and turns you'll never see coming! Great read just like all his books!
B00597A6NU|4|Memphis Belle is a fictionalization of the 1943 documentary Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress that tells the story of the 25th and last mission of an American Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber called the Memphis Belle that was based in England during World War II<br /><br />Having won fame with their exemplary war record and amazing lack of casualties, they expect their final assignment to be a cakewalk. Unfortunately,it was difference from what they expected as it they were assigned to bomb a heavily defended German city.It resulted loss of many lives.Memphis Belle is led by their experienced captain, Dennis Dearborn and the crew shoulders its responsibility despite mounting fears, while their commanding officer and a public relations specialist wait anxiously for their return. Things get interesting when it later found that medical officer Val Kozlowski has fake credentials.<br /><br />The film was definitely made for entertainment for viewers who love films like Top Gun and Iron Eagle.Aside from that,it lacks realism as things that happen in it were definitely far from what probably happened in real life.it was obviously a fictionalization as I have stated in the first paragraph.Despite of it,the film manages to rise above it as it had great actors who delivered great performances.It definitely could provide a feeling of patriotism especially for people who did service in the military.Overall,it is still a war film worth viewing.
B008JMKN4Y|5|Beautiful Disaster is most definitely one of the best books I have ever read!!  I literally had to stay up all night to finsh it; I couldn't put it down.  Granted, I like almost every book I read, but I love this one so much that I have become completely obsessed with it.  I loved how it starts off right away with Travis showing a particular interest in Abby, and as the book goes on it shows how the hate she has for him develops into friendship, and then into something more. Of course, there is certain content in this book that isn't for young readers, but it's that one book I'm forcing all of my friends to read.  I seriously can't wait to read Walking Disaster (already have the due date marked on my ipod calendar) :) and I am freaking out hoping that Beautiful Disaster will become a movie too!! xxoo
1589944607|5|Battlestar Galactica is the board game that put me firmly in the camp of the \\"board game gamer.\\"   When I got this game for myself last Xmas, I was daunted by the long rulebook and the many cards, parts and pieces. It all seemed like too much effort...crisis cards...super crisis cards...Raiders...Heavy Raiders...etcetera. There are many small ships to keep track of and many cardboard pieces which don't always hold up so well after multiple games.   But don't let that stop you. This game is worth the effort.  Since I am a big fan of the \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" TV show, I didn't give up on the game and I played the it at a local gaming convention. And I had a blast!  The Battlestar Galactica board game is complex and time consuming and deals with some adult themes, so I wouldn't recommend it for kids (especially those with short attention spans).  The goal of the game is for the Human fleet to reach the planet Kobol by making FTL (faster than light) \\"jumps\\" through hazardous territory. The Cylons want to prevent this from happening by destroying the Battlestar Galactica or running the Humans out of their four main resources (food, fuel, morale and population) through military attacks and exploiting the mandatory crisis posed to the fleet each turn.  Yes, you'll need at least three hours (give or take) for a game of BSG, but the time spent is worth it, if you ask me.  Yes, making the switch to this kind of complex, adult oriented game isn't easy at first for people who play Parker Brothers board games regularly.  Yes, you will have more fun playing BSG with three or more people. But there are two player and solo rules on the game's web site. I've had fun playing by myself, which (to me) is the sign of a good board game.  Yes, you may get the chance to play as a Cylon and attempt to destroy humanity. Any character being played can be a Cylon, not just the ones who turned out to be such in the TV show. The element of paranoia between the players is a significant element of the game--one which increases with the number of players in the game.  No, everything in the game does not follow the logic set down by the TV show. For example, no character can fly Raptors in the game (Raptors are risked in various card based situations, they don't enter into combat), not even Boomer and Helo who are characters in the TV show who only fly Raptors.  No, it's not easy to be the Humans once a Cylon player is revealed. But that's the point. Human players have to work together to find out which player is a hidden Cylon--while resolving a new crisis every turn, plus Cylon fleet attacks--and then work even harder to fight off the revealed Cylon's determined efforts to destroy humanity.  Yes, each of the main Human (and one Cylon) characters from the first season of the TV show is represented in the game. My favorites are Baltar and Tigh, though Adama and Roslin are great in larger games. And the allure of jumping into a Viper and blasting Cylon Raiders as Apollo or Starbuck is strong.  Yes, Fantasy Flight Games is due to release the Pegasus expansion (in Fall 2009) to the Battlestar Galactica board game, which carries the game through the beginning of season 3 of the TV series.  Whether you like the TV show or hate it, I hope you try and enjoy the Battlestar Galactica board game if what I've written above sounds at all interesting to you.
B00FMQILBC|5|Kids love it!!!!

B00DI75SWM|5|This is a &#34;white noise&#34; generator with multiple sounds and works well.  I can recommend it.
B0086700CM|5|This is the first game I will play
B004G600A4|5|I have watched this movie over 10 times and it still hasnt gotten old. Its special because Disney put a lot of thought and comedy into the \\"typical\\" romance and made the characters realistic and relative. Ever 2 seconds I would think to myself, \\"thats exactly how I act!\\" XD It was just the most adorable movie and I will treasure it and pray that Disney continues down this path.
B004SHGBDG|4|showed up quick and works great..
B000002N1E|5|The 'Purple One's' 1st release under the \\"symbol\\" moniker is a funk, r & b, rock and soul masterpiece! Easily one of his most over-looked efforts that also happens to be one of his best. Slow jams - \\"The Most Beautiful Girl In The World\\", \\"I Hate You\\"...got em. Killer r&b dance numbers - \\"P Control\\", \\"Billy Jack B**ch\\"...got em. Rockers - \\"Endorphinmachine\\", \\"319\\"...got, well you get the picture. Prince also reminds everyone that he is an amazing guitar player. The solo at the end of \\"Gold\\" is worth the price of the album alone...Highly recommend!
B00A7W29BE|5|This is a fine app and I felt compelled to leave a 5 star review just to cancel out some of the unjust one star reviews. Of COURSE this app requires a camera and I'm terribly sorry the Kindle doesn't come with one (neither does my tablet) but on my phone this type of app is very useful. I understand there are plenty of Kindle users on the Amazon App Store but I have a Nook Tablet and a Galaxy S3 on the Amazon App Store, so other devices are out there. Don't take it out on this app! If you're at all dissuaded from purchasing this app due to the one star reviews go and read them and you will find that they are all unfairly written.
B00127RAJY|5|I purchased this DVD to use at home on days when I cannot get to the gym. I felt more results in 20 mins than I have after being at the gym for an hour! Jillian definitely delivers. But follow her advice and start at level I.  I was so sore the day after I started this that I had to go down the steps on my butt! Definitely worth the money! And mine shipped to me in 2 days (with ground shipping) If you want to feel results quickly, this the way to do it!
B003XF1XOQ|4|I was unusually disturbed when a certain tribute died, so I can certainly say the characters and story were engrossing. I just didn't like that Katniss became increasingly irrelevant. Without her, would Mockingjay have unfolded much differently? I thought events would mercilessly forge her into a little general, a leader of the rebellion, a sci-fi Che Guevara, but instead she spent most of the book cowering or recuperating. I also didn't like that many of the best scenes happened off-camera.
B004NSULHM|4|I mean, they've done it all, haven't they? They've reached the pinnacle of their sounds, they've experimented with seeing how far their techniques can go, and here they are, this is where they ended up. It's totally understandable, really. Falling back to their original sounds, or, in other words, just playing out something more prototypically rock music would mean exactly that, falling back, and they just can't do that, eh? They can't go back to \\"The Bends\\" for example, they can't go back to \\"OK Computer\\" in between the two CDs where they found themselves, where they found their style, their mark. Nah, they can't do that. They have to keep pushing the experiments further and further as much as they can until the mutation can mutate no more, and it's an obvious progression to end up here. Know what I mean?
068484267X|5|This has to be one of the best books I've read in a LONG time. It was refreshing to find a book that could keep my wandering mind and High School attention span in check. The trials of the Mc Court family were nothing to laugh at but I often found myself trying very hard to surppres laughter while reading in a classroom where you could easily hear a pin drop. The humerous sections were not based around the events that were taking place, but more around how Frank, as a child, viewed what was going on. The McCourt children knew very little of life and death. What they did know was taught to them by their drunken father and manic depressive mother. Frank seemed to have a slight grasp on the idea that once his younger siblings died he would never see them again, yet he still had many innocent questions. At a very young age Frank was questioning how death happened. He saw a dog get hit by a car and bleed to death. Later on he made another child bleed on the playground. Thinking that blood was death after seeing the dog die from it, Frank feared that he had killed his friend when in all actuality it was a minor injury. Later on in the novel when others take ill and die Frank questions why there was no blood and yet they died. The lack of knowledge and simple questions that Frank had as a child added a great deal to the novel. It was almost depressing when I realized that he would never get those questions answered and just keep wondering. While reading I found myself often forgetting that this was a true story and wondering how an author could come up with a plot line with this many twists and turns. All in all I LOVED this book. It earned each and every one of the five stars not only because it kept my attention for longer than humanly possibly, but because of the way McCourt took tragic events and somehow made the reader believe that for a split second something comical was going on.
B0077SGMXM|5|There is so much to this game. It's a ton of fun and challenging. Definitely makes you think. Probably the first app I've rated 5* in a long long time. Incredibly well made too. Zero issues with freezing. No lagging. Just pure, fun game play.
B0053JJLLC|2|Somehow, someway, I believed that combining the literary forces of these two greats - Richard Preston (\\"The Hot Zone\\") and Michael Crichton (\\"Jurassic Park\\") - would create a masterpiece greater in total than the sum of its individual parts (or authors).  Wrong.  \\"Micro\\" amounts to a predictable, banal attempt that might as well have been titled, \\"Honey, I Shrunk The Graduate Students\\".  Sure, there are a few grotesque insect-ridden attacks to make you cringe (or grin), but that's about all you're going to get with this totally predictable piece of hogwash.  Skip it and instead journey back to the days when Crichton and Preston actually had unique plot ideas peppered with intelligent social commentary.
B009UX2YAC|5|Very challenging. You have to use your brain with this game. You can also use it with FacEbook. But it always says \\"can't connect to FacEbook,try again\\". I don't know if that's happening becAuse I am trying to connect to FacEbook on a kindle fire HD. Maybe you can can only connect to FacEbook on a original kindle fire or cell phone. Other than that a very great game. =)

B00005JKJA|4|Lynch is either insane or brilliant!  I started viewing this with low expectations, given my disappointment in Lost Highway, but the next day and the day after... I was still thinking about this film and curious about Lynch's intent and the layers of mystery.  (For great insights, check out the reviews on the Rotten Tomatoes website.  Read about his use of color, the connection the the Black Dahlia murder case and other clues to really appreciate this film.)  He repeats a lot of themes and metaphors in his films.  Fans of Twin Peaks (TV series and the film) and Blue Velvet and Eraserhead will recognize Lynch's techniques. Again and again, he gives us quirky, baffling imagery that both amuses and terrifies.   I think ultimately, several of his films to date are progress toward a film not yet made, one that will be his signature piece.  I suspect that if the rumor of Lynch making a movie about the Black Dahlia is true, that could be THE movie for Lynch.  He certainly is able to create the atmosphere -- we see dreamy, starry-eyed optimism that morphs into desperation and terror.  I think that with Mulholland Drive, Lynch is closer to this realization than ever before.
1451668953|1|Advertised in good condition.(All but good condition)! Was NOT advertised as &#34; SMALL&#34; paperback. Just paperback which I took as meaning club size paperback!!!
B00QMVRK6I|5|Love it.  Some of the best of the 80's recombined and refreshed for 2015!  Very Journey like in sound, but with a slightly harder edge.
B0094K1WZE|5|The cons are I run it on my Roku Stick and it lags. Every two to three minutes the movie stopped and would have to load. Def is not my isp either. Netflix and Chrunchieroll(for anime) run smoothly and in good quality.

1573225517|4|I was required to read this book for a Modern Fiction class I am in. I really did enjoy the work and would recommend it to others.  <br /> <br />This book is about the \\"modern loser\\", Rob, who is a music snob. Rob uses his top five all time most humiliating heart breaks to describe who he is and where he comes from. He shows you his faults and lets you into his mind. This \\"modern loser\\" is easy to relate to or relate to someone you know.  <br /> <br />The book begins with his long time girlfriend walking out on him, a thing he is familiar with. You are spun through the heart breaks of Rob's life and how each one has brought him to the man you see today. Rob, who owns a record store, uses music as a biography of his life. He looks down on those who are not in-the-know about what good music is, or at least his version of it and blames pop music for the depressing life of its fans.  <br /> <br />I really enjoyed seeing through Rob's eyes his view of women. You could see his record shop and the people who worked there. I enjoyed the way Rob described things from his life. I could have lived without so many of his top five lists. I am not a music snob so some of the music talk bored me.  <br />  <br />This book is really enjoyable but I do recommend reading the book before watching the movie.  <br />
B0073PPNE8|5|Second time that we have watched it - and enjoyed it.Now living fairly close to Cold Mountain so it was good to see the local scenery
B00B1RB942|4|decided to buy this cause I already read the books
B004LWZWGA|2|Left with the impression that I missed something in the midnight screening of \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" after rave reviews from critics and die hards opposed my initial thoughts, I knew I would have to watch it again to form a solid opinion. Then the movie theater massacre happened in Colorado and my second viewing got post-poned... indefinitely.<br /><br />After a Black Friday shopping spree led to the purchase of \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" DVD for $13, my chance arrived yet again. And yet again, I've been let down. \\"The Dark Knight Rises,\\" like \\"Spider-Man 3,\\" is a trilogy clunker that coasts on the belief that bigger is better.<br /><br />The problems are still there, two viewings in: Christopher Nolan expands the cast to include characters that are too quickly introduced and too focused on for us to care. Peter Foley (played by weakest link, Matthew Modine), Miranda Tate (the \\"written strictly for the third act character\\" played by Marion Cotillard), and John Blake (a Joseph Gordon-Levitt, whose assumption that Bruce Wayne is Batman is so ludicrous it lingers for the remaining two hours and causes us to wonder if he knows that Batman is actually Christian Bale) are generally unwelcomed additions to a story that's thinner than what its weaver hopes we think it isn't. This is \\"Batman Begins\\" all over again, only it attempts a loftier reach for epicness that inadvertently causes it to be the most cartoonish in Nolan's desperate-to-be- realistic franchise.<br /><br />The only new character given justice is Selina Kyle, who, as played by Anne Hathaway, is too underused for how good she is.<br /><br />Even at 165 minutes, \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" feels like a rushed effort. Scenes transition into others like a contestant at a hot dog eating contest waits to digest his next wiener. The pacing is fast, but the result is not edge-of-your-seat inducing. It's messy. And rarely anything more.<br /><br />On top of the bloated pretentiousness, \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" sound-editing is atrocious. Between Howard Shore's score and Bane's Sean Connery impersonation, the mute dialogue featured in \\"The Artist\\" resounds as more audible. Not only does \\"Rises\\" adopt the motif that bigger is better, but also louder, and it's all to its disadvantage.<br /><br />As the conclusion to a trilogy, \\"Rises\\" should have been more intimate than special-effects ridden. Scenes showing \\"The Bat\\" dodging missiles lack suspense, compared to the ones wherein Bruce Wayne encounters Selina Kyle at a charity ball. And while the level of talent involved cannot be denied, their use can. I thought \\"The Dark Knight\\" was a comic book masterpiece and I think a lot of others are confusing its affiliation with this picture to mean the same. Not so. \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is smoke and mirrors. A motion picture that deserved better from the expectations set by its own creator.<br /><br />FINAL SCORE: Cis atrocious.

0385474547|5|Achebe's Things Fall Apart is nothing short of brilliant.  This is the best book that I've read in a long time.  The story is simple, yet powerful.  As a college literature professor, this book will become a staple on my syllabus.  Things Fall Apart accomplishes what all great literature does: it teaches us and moves us.  That's all we can ask for.

B008HK3XU4|3|I just wish I could further protect the device's screen with a good film protector, and the case could be made a little tougher. I have a lot of junk in my purse, and sometimes I find minor scratches on the case.
0399230033|5|I give this as a baby present (along with Pat the Bunny) all the time. I think it is hysterical!
0811729117|5|As has been stated before, the translation initially seems clumsy, but the calibre of the soldier authoring the work quickly shines through. Brutal stories are told but the work is not particularly brutal or gory  and it does not descend into simply being an action story of who fired when, etc. Some readers may find that understatement disappointing, but over time the enormity of the man's experience produces a deep respect on it's own, and it forces your imagination into work mode to understand what the situation would really have been like. An excellent exposition of the tragic command failures by both sides, and a fresh viewpoint on the war that does not cross the line into bitter nationalism.<br /><br />Helps if you're a tank fan (and obviously a history nerd) but hardly necessary to appreciate it from a historical, military, or personal standpoint. Highly recommended.

B0000024RQ|5|Even if Bob Dylan had never released another album after his 1963 sophomore effort, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, his place in the history of twentieth century music history would be perfectly secure. The album is an absolutely landmark for folk music.<br />It is not Mr. Dylan's approach that makes the LP so exciting. The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan is the sound of a folk singer doing what folk singers have always done: sing to the common people of what is going on across the country.  It was the alarming developments going on across the country that was so exciting. The Cuban Missile Crisis had just past, Vietnam was right around the corner, and, as the nuclear arms race escalated, everything seemed as if it could be gone tomorrow. Meanwhile, a new generation was arising, one that would test the uncharted waters of post-WWII society, inherit a world on the brink and decide how the norms must change to meet a tomorrow than never seemed more different than yesterday. It was a brave new world and someone had to sing about it.<br />Mr. Dylan was the first folk artist to show an understanding of the more terrifying and far-reaching changes that were engulfing the world around him. Resounding with a poet's clear-headed sharpness and folkie's wide-eyed innocence, dazzling Freewheelin' songs such as \\"Masters of War,\\" \\"Talkin' World War III Blues,\\" \\"Oxford Town\\" \\"I Shall Be Free,\\" \\"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\\" and \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" brilliantly recapitulated this fascinating atmosphere. Sometimes Mr. Dylan's approach was wry and zany. \\"Talkin' World War III Blues\\" is a tongue-in-cheek recount of jaunting across a postapocalyptic city while \\"I Shall Be Free\\" places a merry drunk in the world of JFK and air raid drills. Sometimes it was gravely serious. \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" is an open-hearted pat-on-the-back to troubled denizens of the day while \\"Masters of War\\" is perhaps the most scathing insult to callous, warlord politicians ever put into verse. No matter what his tone, no songwriter had a greater grasp on the almost incomprehensible times than the brilliant, young Mr. Dylan. He may not have been the first somewhat politically minded folk-singer but he was the first with the intelligence, skill and bravery to face, head-on, many of the more overwhelming troubles that had recently entered the world. To put it bluntly, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan is the sound of folk music entering the second half of the twentieth century.<br />Not every song on album is steeped in revolution, though. An album so densely coated in insight and immensity would boggle the mind so Mr. Dylan treats us to some quaint, more traditionally minded, gems about love and wanderin' between the heavier songs. \\"Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance\\" and \\"Bob Dylan's Blues\\" are easy-going country ramblers while \\"Girl from the North Country\\" and \\"Bob Dylan's Dream\\" are sincere, mournful dirges. The greatest of Freewheelin's personal songs, however, is \\"Don't Think Twice, It's Alright,\\" a shove-off to an former lover that features Mr. Dylan's seething wit at its best.<br />The songs of the Freewheelin' Bob Dylan sparked a sensation. In the coming years they would be covered countless times, chanted at protest rallies and on street corners and their messages would be incorporated into the values of a new generation. The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan is the seminal force of folk music entering a new era, stronger than ever.
B0000027RL|5|I really didn't get into Pearl Jam until about 1998. I had heard their super popular songs Even flow, Alive, Black, and Jeremy and liked them a alot. A a stuggling guitarist able only to play the simplistic Nirvana style riffs, the incredable soloing here by PJ lead guiatar player is what caught me. WoW! Check out Porch, Garden, Even Flow, Alive, and Once for some incredable guitar work. <BR>Fueled by Vedder's incredable voice and lyrics this is a CD with not one weak track. Since i have purcahsed this CD I have purcahsed many subsequent PJ titles such as Vs. Vitalogy, No code, and Yeild. It has been nice getting into a band that has grown and improved over their long twelve year or so existance. Now I kno why they are so well respected by peers like Pete Townsend, Chris Cornell, Flea, Neil Young, and Michael Stripe. <BR>Ten is now up there as one of my favorite pure rock cds with Led Zepplin III, Jimmi Hendrix Are u Experinced, and Beatles White ALbum. I kno its high calibur, but Pearl Jam's has outsold any other grunge band for a reason: its a classic album!
B00005OAIE|4|I will be short. A young guy who writes his own music, plays the guitar soulfully and has the voice of an (I admit hoarse) angel, deserves nothing but respect. I'm happy to hear some real, ment music with all it's shortcomings and cliche's. I will wait for more and am sure that he will deliver. And all of you who are talking about Dave Matthews: I can't hear any resemblence in their voices.
B00F35B8F8|5|Great movie!
0375869026|2|Very readable style and engaging characters and voices.  Our son received this as a gift for his 9th birthday.  He is an advanced reader who is adept at picking up the subtleties and innuendoes in more mature books.  Since I had not read this beforehand we read it together each evening, and I often found I needed to skip over sections which were too graphic and mature (medical & puberty issues etc.) which we find inappropriate for 3rd and 4th and even 5th graders.  I think there are better ways to accomplish the story without trying to evoke sympathetic wallowing, the opposite of kindling the compassionate nature of man. (We read Because of Winn Dixie right before- if you haven't already, it's a much better read!)
0385333846|5|Slaughterhouse-Five is, as its jacket cover boasts, \\"one of the world's great antiwar books.\\" Centered around the infamous firebombing of Dresden in late World War II, the novel takes its readers on a ridiculous journey through the life of Billy Pilgrim, a detached sort of fellow who has become unstuck in time. As sad as it is hilarious, Slaughterhouse-Five is a thought-provoking novel whose morals are disguised by absurdity. Be prepared for Vonnegut's refreshingly strange writing style; the book is much more enjoyable if you let Vonnegut carry you away to his unique and darkly humorous world. It takes some effort to decipher the novel's abstruse themes, but there is much to be learned from Billy's search for meaning in a seemingly meaningless world.
B001TAFCBC|1|This was supposed to be a wonderful romantic movie, but it aw helter-skelter from the start. Very disjointed and a downer. I wouldn't watch it for free!

B000000OXH|4|The songs &quot;Don't Cry&quot; and &quot;The Smile Has Left Your Eyes&quot; are true hits. Also &quot;Midnight Sun&quot; should be a sleeper hit. A really great song! It showcases John Wetton's singing and Goeff  Downe's keyboards but the great Steve Howe is a bit muted here on this  album though...a good choice anyhow!

Winona is spectaculer and so are some other roles.  It  is also boring.  It does have some wonderful cinematogrophy but, it pales  in comparison to Interview.

B00014TJ7K|4|the disc is the best that George Harrison has in his catalog. The music is great! I love all of the songs except for one of the additional tracks. Zig zag is a track that could have been left off the re-release of the disc. The other thing that this disc has going for it is the additional big name musicians that are playing with Harrison. They include: jeff lynne, Eric Clapton, and Elton John. This is a must have for anyone who loves Harrison's music.

0062365584|3|Douglas and Connie, married nearly 25 years are about to embark on a European holiday along with their seventeen year old son as a sort of farewell hurrah before he leaves for college. Just before the trip, Connie whispers to Doug in the night that she feels their marriage has run its course and that she thinks she wants to leave him. Douglas is devastated and quietly plans to use the trip as a means to win her back.<br /><br />Such is the start of an overly long tale about the relationship between Connie and Doug and their singular relationships with their son. The book is sectioned based on their trip itinerary with short chapter blocks making up the text. Us alternates back and forth in past and present, taking us through the initial meeting of Connie and Doug all the way into their marriage, a personal tragedy, and the birth of their son Albie. The rest of the story take place in the present as the Peterson’s navigate a dysfunctional family trip through Europe’s major cities. An altercation involving Albie about halfway through their holiday has Douglas taking stock of his current situation and making a major decision regarding his marriage.<br /><br />It is plain to see that from the beginning Connie and Doug were ill suited as a couple yet their opposite personality styles may have had an effect of tempering and could have contributed to their marriage lasting as long as it did which is itself is remarkable after coming to know the characters.<br /><br />This story felt as about as long as Connie and Doug’s marriage lasted. It was so drawn out that I felt as if I were reading the same pages over and over again, waiting to get to the final resolution of whether or not these two make it. Did Nicholls write this with a movie in mind? It literally felt that this story would never end which was frustrating. Connie’s free spiritedness gave way to a juvenile lack of commitment that was not becoming on a fifty somewhat year old woman. Douglas, overly square and dull was the one who loved more in this relationship but still could not lighten-up and be what Connie wanted. As Douglas painfully tries to evolve and be more than what he has been, I rooted harder for him yet there was still a feeling of exasperation for this character.<br /><br />All in all this story did a great job of showcasing so many ordinary marriages and their individual nuances. What keeps them going and what is the catalyst that breaks them apart? The fear of a child leaving the nest and abandoning the couple to themselves is an important marital theme that was gratefully addressed. In the end, you just want everyone to finally be at peace and live a life that brings them joy.ore in this relationship but still could not lighten-up and be what Connie wanted.

B00AMBK0X4|2|The only funny scenes were in the 1st half of the movie, most of which were spoiled in the previews.  Then, half way through the movie, it turned weird and almost like they were switching to romantic comedy format.  Extremely disappointing, as I looked forward to seeing this for over 6 months.
B00K0OI42W|5|A perfectly wonderful tale, childhood innocence set against both virtue and evil. Everyone should read it again before reading her new one.

0757302661|5|I can't imagine laboring any other way! Hypnobirthing techniques really work to ease labor pains. I read the book and took the class at my hospital for my first pregnancy. Unfortunately, my son was breech and was a scheduled c-section. I did the techniques on my own during my second pregnancy and was able to deliver a healthy baby girl via VBAC. The doctor and nurses kept coming into the room shocked at how calmly things were progressing because they could tell on the monitor that my contractions were getting stronger. Whenever I came out of relaxation, I immediately felt nauseous. I would highly recommend trying this technique. Even if you can't use it during labor, it's great for quelling fears during pregnancy. I'm buying it again for my third pregnancy.

B009P3N1GI|3|This is Brandon Sanderson being Brandon Sanderson. It doesn't exactly shock or surprise, nor does it disappoint. It's one of his books that is well... a bit less memorable than some others... Not to say this is a bad story, it's just that Sanderson has better books (and worse).<br /><br />It's an awkward length, somewhere between a short story and a novella, but has the benefit of being pretty tight and devoid of unnecessary material. Sanderson does like to go on and on sometimes, much like his idol Jordan, and I'll agree that nobody could have finished Wheel of Time better. However, this book is lean and mean by his standards, and so we're left with a fairly simple idea, sparsely presented.<br /><br />Is it a good idea? Yes, it is. It's worth reading about. Is Sanderson's writing sharp enough to carry a top-notch short story? Not so much. He does ok, but you could imagine this turning into a classic in the hands of a more literary writer. As it is, it's one of those stories you read because you love Brandon Sanderson.<br /><br />Sanderson is one of those safe writers. He always entertains. You won't be bored or disappointed. You know you can open something of his, forget your troubles and get away from the real world for a while. There won't be too much stress. You won't be challenged, or scared, or excited more than is comfortable. You'll want to keep reading, but not too much.<br /><br />This book is actually a bit more on edge than his longer works. That doesn't make it better or worse, just different. It requires a bit more effort than something like the first Mistborne book, but it's not a hard read (and it's a lot shorter).<br /><br />He's easy to read, easy to enjoy, but ultimately thematically weak. A lot of his books tend towards weak character arcs where it all feels a bit manufactured. That's something he's getting better at, and Way of Kings has great character arcs, but here we get to really see him struggle with that issue.<br /><br />I think a different title might have helped this. It just sounds too much like his other titles and it deserved something to make it stand out more.<br /><br />For stories like this, Michael Swanwick excels. His shorts are punchy, vivid and thematically strong. Unless you're a Sanderson completist, you're better off reading Swanwick's work than this. Sanderson is at his best when he goes long, as he so often does.
B004JZBGWI|5|I have been using this app for a few weeks now.  I love it. I can make lists or notes on the fly, email the notes to print off at home or work, use the calendar to post appointments (color coded), and search for content.  I'm finding it's one of my go-to apps for keeping track of all kinds of things.  I tried one other Note app but this is far superior.  Works great on my Kindle Fire.
B007NESBK2|5|Iam quite an audio file and can be very critical of poor recordings. This disc is recorded very well,the blueray transfer from the master conveys all the texture of Sade's beautiful voice! The sound is extremely transparent with the appropriate soundstaging.! I had the privilege of seeing this concert live and this disc brings me back every time!!
B000AMJG4Y|5|Yes, I know there's no plot. Yes, I know that it actually creates more questions than answers. However, the absolutely fantastic CGI kind of pushes that out of your mind. You will end up gaping at the screen in awe once the movie is over and your mind will not even think of plot until your second or third time through. <br /> <br />Plot: Set 2 years after the game, there's a mysterious disease infecting the children of Midgar. A trio of brothers, led by Kadaj, plans to use this disease to help them get Jenova and recreate Sephiroth, but Cloud, being our reluctant hero once again, can't let them do so. However, before he can save the world, he must first save himself from his own inner demons. <br /> <br />A lot of those inner demons involve Aerith. I thought we had solved this problem in the game, but it seems that we must bring this issue to the surface once again. <br /> <br />But who cares? The CGI was fantastic. The music was fantastic. The action was mind blowing. Overall, watching it will be an unforgettable experience that you won't regret at all. Because of that, 5 stars.
0679442790|4|Michael Berg is fifteen years old when he is diagnosed with Hepatitis.  During a difficult bout of the disease, Michael falls ill on his way home, where a woman rescues him.  The woman is Frau Schmitz, a thirty-six-year-old \\"spinster\\" who works as a tour guide.  Michael pays her a visit to thank her for helping him.  Before he knows it, he embarks on a sexual relationship with the mysterious, taciturn woman who calls herself Hanna.  During their affair, they do two things -- they have sex and he reads to her.  Hanna loves to be read to, and Michael derives a certain pleasure from pleasing her.  But then one day she disappears -- not to be seen again until a day in court, where she is accused of a heinous crime.  Is Hanna involved in Nazi-related crimes?  Had she been hiding in Michael's town for a reason?  Hanna, the beautiful blonde who had seen Michael as nothing more than a sexual object, is finally revealed to him in her true colors.<br /><br />This is a unique and beautifully told story set during the late thirties and early forties.  Bernhard Schlink wrote this in German, I think, and Carol Brown Janeway translated it into English.  I hope nothing was lost in translation because this story is very enthralling and I'd hate it if the original had been written better.  In any event, Janeway wrote this with clear and lyrical prose and I couldn't put this book down as Michael told us about his love affair with an older woman.  I haven't seen the film this book is based on.  Needless to say, I look forward to watching it, especially after Kate Winslet (who happens to be one of my favorite actresses) won an Oscar for this role.  I can't recommend this enough.  Read it and enjoy it iff you haven't given it a whirl.
B0058DRTGC|5|I loved good to great, and I kept asking myself, how would I implement this at my church or volunteer organization? Tada!
B00AZQGZVM|5|Great product! Pretty big! Kks lookin pretty cool Playin shows every saturday night!(doesnt actually play music but doesnt mean i cant put the music on myself and pretend,)
B0001DI0FI|5|An absolutely stunning movie based on an absolutely stunning series of books. I'm about half way through the Aubrey Maturin series right now and notice that the movie takes elements from more than one or two of them. In fact the \\"weevil\\" joke is in about book 6.<br />Russell Crowe is a perfect Jack Aubrey. Paul Bettany a bit too tall and good looking for Stephen. And shouldn't Bonden have been bigger and burlier? Pity Jack and Stephen's wives weren't here. I'd like to have seen a good screen incarnation of Diana. Peter Weir does a brilliant job of showing us a ship as a floating community. And the things we learn about ship surgery are daunting.<br />The story, like the books, meanders a bit, but it's one of those instances where the journey is more important than the destination.
B000W91RUG|5|I didn't start watching Big Bang when it first appeared on television, and now see how silly that was.  This is a great show with a completely different brand of comedy than I've seen anywhere else.  Some of the jokes can go over people's heads who aren't very into math and/or science, but it's still easy to determine they are hilarious.  This first season is very fun, and I can't wait to purchase the second season.
B00BU987C8|5|This album is too good for words. Start on the first track and finish on the last, you will understand the genius that is Kendrick Lamar.<br />This album will always be in my collection. As well as Section.80.
B006LSZECO|3|The books drags along, following the narrative of two people until they reach the same timeline.  The last 20% of the book rushes through the conclusion , and a weak ending.
B0064X7FVE|5|Very good app to have. I have used this many many times especially when visiting other cities.

1451627297|5|Wonderful book.  I stopped reading Stephen King after Cujo.  His work was too graphic and too filled with horrible images.  A friend told me about this book, so I took a chance.  Beautifully written, great idea...what would happen if we could go back in time and stop the assassination of JFK?  I won't tell you what it is about, but I haven't given anything away since you are told this premise from the beginning.  Interesting journey....I loved this book
B00910Y1OQ|5|lovely fun challenging for all ages and gamers great to relax with and infinite play<br />try it it is addicting for sure
0345535421|4|enjoyable reading, if you like Game of Thrones,<br />you need to read the books for details.  This is adult fantasy/adventure.
B00TEKGL0U|5|A great album with a classic rock and soul heart. A good addition for some new music that fans of early 70's emerging punk too.
B009HNDCC4|5|This show makes me laugh, everytime I see it and I tell everyone to watch. Thanks to my Kindle I never miss an episode.
B0080BFVPU|5|Viewing Equipment: Epson 3010 3D PJ on a 92\\" DaLite Screen. Given the wide variety of reviews related to the PQ I was a little nervous about picking this one up. Grosse Point Blank is an all-time favorite film of mine and holds up extremely well on repeat viewings.<br /><br />I actually saw this in theatres when it first came out. Since I also view films on a very large format screen, nothing gets by me very easy. I had an opportunity to view this over the holidays on a family members 106\\" DaLite screen opposed to my usual 92\\". I must say the PQ was very good! I felt like I was watching a print; not video. I couldn't disagree more with any negative reviews of the PQ. I respect the opinions, but it certainly wasn't the experience I had thankfully. I sat about 15 feet back from the 106\\" screen. I noticed a few specks and scratches here and there, but nothing too egregious. I did notice some light ringing in scene or two. The only reason I caught that was because I was scrutinizing it very closely given some of the very harsh reviews I have read related to the PQ. The other thing that I find amusing is the fact that the DVD release of this film is non-anamorphic! You can't even seriously compare the DVD to the BD release of this film! LOL! The BD blows it away! I threw in the DVD first and watched it for awhile to see if I would notice a difference and when I put the BD in there was no comparison. I have seen some crappy BD's, but this isn't one of them. Batman Begins comes to mind. The PQ on that BD was very disappointing in many scenes. I think people tend to unfairly compare stuff shot recently on HD digital cameras and forget what film looks like.<br /><br />Fans of this film can purchase with confidence. The PQ is a solid 4 out of 5 stars.
B003QSOFFO|5|I love Disney movies! I am so happy that Amazon has these  movies on the internet when I have a craving.
0399237720|5|My child loves this book. It's a huge version and she loves to sit on it and try to flip the pages.
B00003CXSP|3|A few thoughts...<br />1)  I read the book (which was not the best) and thankfully the movie doesn't follow the book too closely (especially the ending).<br />2) Julianne Moore took on a big task of taking over for Jodie Foster - it took me until half way through the movie to stop comparing the two.  Julianne did an okay job of portraying Clarice.<br />3)  The movie was slow in parts...just like the book.  Especially the scenes in Europe.<br />All in all, it's a decent movie...not the best but not the worst I have seen.  There are some really good parts and great special effects.  Anthony Hopkins really helps bring the movie to an average level.
0060392886|5|I read your book guys, unable to put it down read it in one day. I just congradulate you all, and say you have'nt quite shocked me, but, the book is a good book, ( having been around you in the early days in Glendora, Whiskey, Roxy, etc. 81-85) I'm still speachless. Congradulations, on the book and on hanging in there, thru those years! Good Luck to all of you.
B0054JZC6E|2|It seems as though these are little mobile games and the concept of this is absolutely different, infact so different that this app isn't worthwhile your time unless you like to unlock games with poor graphics!!!

B007REV4YI|5|Interesting film with twists. Very good villain. Though moving back to characters we reconize, was sorry to see the DB-5 sacrificed. Maybe Blofeld and Specter will return.
B00BSBR9N6|5|This is not only laugh-out-loud hilarious (literally), it is also masterfully written. I started reading this after having a particularly crappy day, at the end of particularly grueling week. In short, I needed an escape very badly and this delivered in spades. I loved Don, despite his quirks I recognized a lot of myself in him and couldn't wait to see how he dealt and reasoned with every new situation he encountered. Mr. Simsion simply made him come to life and very accurately, as I used to work with kids on the Autism spectrum.  I really don't know how she did it but this book is magic. Well done Mr. Simsion, well done.
B00HY7VU60|5|Great movie
B008BQ8YHQ|5|Loving this series...have not stopped watching.
1781162646|4|I admire King's storytelling and writing style - his characters are vivid and compelling and the syntax of his capturing 1973 is \\"right on!\\" Other than the cringeworthy, foreshadowed and derivative \\"Summer of '42\\" sex scene and rather abrupt ending, I liked this book a great deal.
B001EN71CW|5|My ultimate favourite TV series of all time! Joss Whedon did a wonderful job!
B00005JMYI|5|One of the single greatest movies ever made. In my book this movie should have won several oscars including Best Picture, best actor (Will Ferrell), and Steve Carell hands down should have won best supporting actor for playing everyone's favorite weatherman (take that Al Roker) Brick Tamland,who likes to eat ice cream and really enjoys a nice pair of slacks. Years later, a doctor will tell him that he has an I.Q. of 48 and am what some people call mentally retarded.
B00HQ1FCSQ|2|The title of this review sums up Jake's character, in his own words no less. He was a violent, jealous man, who amounted to very little good.<br /><br />Throughout this entire film I was expecting some catharsis, to no avail. This movie had very little entertainment value, and was a huge disappointment.<br /><br />A lot of people are misguided in thinking that having fierce will and determination, is admirable. It is not. However, conviction in doing what is right and good, IS admirable. Someone who goes through life blind to that distinction, is a danger to themselves and others. That sums up Jake's life, and why I have no compassion or sympathy for him.<br /><br />He could have superhuman abilities in the boxing ring, but that doesn't mean a damn thing unless he's a good man. And he was not. This is more or less the story of a villain, not a hero. Regardless of his human frailties, he chose time and again to do the wrong thing to others, particularly the ones who were close to him. For no other apparent reason, except that he was selfish and stubborn. It's tragic, and not enjoyable to watch in the least.<br /><br />I'm extremely surprised that this movie is considered one of the best movies of all time. The story doesn't merit that praise.
B005XY67WI|5|Exceptional woman!!
0525953728|4|Thank you for your service doesn't begin to say it.  Truly grateful.
0930289528|5|Wow. Can this really be twenty years old? In many ways, it's a story that could have come from the current day. A brutal, totalitarian regime has installed itself in the UK. They have installed Orwellian surveillance of the population, an apparat for monitoring the cameras and microphones, and a secret police with powers of summary justice, to enforce their iron rule. First, they purge the music, books, and culture of the old ways. They, they round up the homosexuals, \\"darkies,\\" and other threats to the white sameness of their populace. Some are deported; others are turned over to death camps and to sadistic medical \\"experiments.\\" The human test animals were transformed in bizarre ways, and died in droves.<br /><br />All but one, test subject five. He was transformed, too, in ways that the prison keepers never detected. At least, not until he blew it up around them and burned the ruins. Then, he vanished. So, over the next few years, did those who staffed the prison - dead one after another. Number five, roman numeral V, had been transformed into vengeance, against his torturers and against the government that institutionalized that torture.<br /><br />The story is what makes this comic. The artwork does a workmanlike job of carrying the story and the characters within it - for better and (more often) for worse. The recent movie changed this story in many particulars, but kept the story largely intact. Despite the differences, or because of them, both versions work well.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B00CNQ7HAU|5|One of the best John Grisham books I have read in several years. My Mother's will was difficult to probate due to some cut offs in the family. Good read for me!
B005ZOBNOI|5|A very easy read-I'm not usually one for romance novels, but this was lighthearted and intelligent! Way to go, John Green
B007BVMVDU|5|I love to watch this in HD, because the scenery and everything else is so beautiful. Love the story, great mix of the mystical, knights, magic and history. Was hard to stop watching at 2 am.
B008JMKN4Y|3|As much as I wanted to hate Travis, he fulfilled that desire of every woman...to be Cherished and protected.  The problem with this book is that it peaked around halfway through and then became like front row seats to every bad relationship I've ever dealt with.  You know those friends that are constantly breaking up, then getting back together?  Well imagine having to read the memoirs to their relationship.  Not to mention, Travis' behavior in reality would be considered controlling and stalkerish.  Three stars was generous, only because I really enjoyed the beginning.
B00DYOOGYK|4|It is a grate GAME other than it glitches. But other than that it is a grate GAME and u can't rob the stores I think that should b in the next update and it is awesome  seeing a fight between different gangs or bikers. I think that In a new update there should also b cops responding to those fights 2.and I can't get in to a gang so if u r getting.the game 4 that I would not get it.
B009YP9L7U|4|I should've known this little diddy would be a romance, but alas it snuck up on me once again! It was a fun story though, and showed some interesting ideas on how to deal with these types of situations (just in case this were to ever happen to you! Ha!).
B00000JPH6|5|and haunting and exciting and scary and fun and sad and magical and puppets!  Go figure...
B0041KKYGU|3|Not a bad movie; but I didn't care for the way it portrayed teachers in a bad light.  At least in the end it turns that around.  not a bad story over all but I couldn't rate it very highly.

B000A7Q2DM|4|I won't suffer <br />Be Broken <br />Get tired <br />Or wasted <br />Surrender <br />To nothing... <br /> <br />        The opening words to the newest album from Jared Leto and company.  The follow-up to 2002's S/T debut is a lot more than a stanza of poetry, but the line sums up the albums meaning pretty well.   <br />  This is an unrelenting album that not only showcases the bands musicianship, which is top notch for a rock band of this caliber, but also their penchant for writing huge choruses with great hooks.  Forget about solo's and thirty minute epics, this album is about tight song writing- songs with punch that say what they mean and get out before they're welcome is worn out. <br /> This is a departure in sound for this band that could, formerly, credit most of their influence to bands like Nine Inch Nails, Stabbing Westward and KMFDM.  It sounds like Leto has been listening to a lot of NIN still but has also mixed in some My Chemical Romance and The Used as the sound is more abrasive on this album.  While Jared Leto is still on vocals, his voice is less produced and more natural, with cracks and screams all over the place that give him a new sound and life. <br /> Giving nods to contemporary rock acts like The Used doesn't mean they've ripped that sound off but it does means that if you liked the first album, there is no guarantee that you'll like this album.  The lyrics are more personal, giving the album much more warmth then the industrially laced S/T disc.  Leto emotes much better on this disc and finally shows the ability to capture an audience not only with his previous acting career, but finally, with vocal lines that bring an audience closer instead of pushing them away.  <br />  The album loses none of the aforementioned punch throughout, though the first three tracks on the album are probably the best; i.e.:  Attack, Beautiful Lie, The Kill. <br />30 Seconds bills themselves as a progressive rock act, but I wouldn't go so far as to call them that.  They've got the rock part down... but why bother going down the progressive road when you can write an album like this?   <br /> <br />For fans of: Nine Inch Nails, The Used, U2 (yeah, they really have all those sounds) <br />

B00A6PD9I4|5|Very enjoyable film; Delighted that there was no prince (or other male) to save the day; All the &#34;saving&#34; that gets done is by the princess herself; Also, though she is cute and idealized, she is not sexy or wearing sexy clothes; Warning - some parts are quite scary and suspenseful for little ones! [we watched it with our 3.5 & 5 yr olds, and both needed a lap a quarter of the way into the film, and for the duration, though both are begging to watch it again now]
B00L9B7IKE|3|In the mood for a mystery, I dove into this pretty well-reviewed tale. Were it not for wanting to see if the killer was who I thought it was, I finished it. As a mystery, I found it wanting but, worse, as a story, it has an appalling number of shallow and seemingly stupid women. The men don't come off much better. One character, while naïve, was recognizable, even appealing. Another, a practicing alcoholic was so excessive in her commitment to being drunk daily I could just about smell the liquor. A good mystery balances on credibility. I found this had none.
0375434526|5|I loved this book.  It is a typical Dan Brown book where you couldn't put it down.  I made the mistake of reading other reviews before reading the book and one person decided to tell us all about the ending...what an idiot. I guess he thought he was so interesting and intelligent that he kept going on and on about his borish opinion. While reading the book, I kept thinking about the ending.  Luckily, it really didn't ruin it for me. I would recommend this book to those of you who loved the Di Vince Code and Angels and Demons.
B00EKTCQCC|2|then they want you to buy too many extra parts. Just gave enough to interest you.I wish I hadn't messed with.B.Lawson
1594200106|5|Bar none the best first sentence of any book I have ever had the pleasure to read. And the rest of the work only gets better every time I read it. I have had to purchase a new copy; I read the old one literally to pieces. Highly, Highly recommend. Story telling at its finest.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Sycamore Row was an outstanding sequel to A Time To Kill. Grisham has a true gift for story telling. This novel was a true page turner that will leave you full of emotions and will have you in deep discussion. This would be perfect for a book club. Sycamore Row is a MUST READ!
B003S3F8SA|5|Dive into Nolan's labyrinthine worlds within worlds with only music as your guide. You will get lost - and you will love every second of it. This is an extreme musical trip into the unknowable.<br /><br />To anyone who has not yet seen this epic movie I would strongly recommend to do so. Nevertheless, the soundtrack stands on its own. Zimmer only had the script to go by so his compositions reflect his own take on the characters and events of the movie and are not simply there to complement the pictures.<br /><br />The collections starts off ominously with the short HALF REMEMBERED DREAM, reaches an early peak with THE DREAM IS COLLAPSING, turns playfully threatening with ONE SIMPLE IDEA to end with my favorite, TIME, a majestic closing piece, full of new found hope and open sunbathed vistas.<br /><br />If you think of buying this because you were blown away by the trailer music keep in mind that it is not included. That piece is called [[ASIN:B004I2JUS4 Mind Heist]] and it was actually composed by Zack Hemsey, not Hans Zimmer.<br /><br />This is the music of the worlds within, the sound of our subconscious fears and most secret dreams; the sound of the pulsating thread that connects us with the Universe.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B00F87ZUYG|4|With the plot heading in so many interesting directions. I found it boring/frustrating that we had to spend so much time watching Rick hide under the bed.
1623420148|4|I have a love and hate relationship with this book, but it leans more towards love. I will give Emma this, the story was absolutely different than anything I've ever read. I appreciate Drew for being unapologetic. He was who he was and what you saw was what you got, until he met Kate, who happened to be one of the few female characters that doesn't get on my nerves.<br /><br />Sometimes the writing voice was annoying, the way Drew would describe his analogies in question form, but at the same time I appreciated it because it was true to his voice.<br /><br />Another thing I liked was the plot twists. It's weird, because it's the kind of story where you think you know what's going to happen, but you truly don't. Everytime something happened that I assumed was close to the ending, i'd see how much percentage was left and be surprised to find I hadn't gone that long.<br /><br />SPOILER!!<br /><br />The only thing that bothered me is when Drew realized he loved her. Wasn't it after he came in her or something? I just kind of rolled my eyes. I know guys love sex but Drew was a mess with it sometimes lol. I also love how it didn't drag through their interactions in the beginning.<br /><br />Good story. 4 stars only cause of my love hate for it and I started skipping a lot towards the end.
B005GFPZYK|5|I'm glad Kyle got to write this book before he passed away.  These guys make Black Hawk Down sound like just another day at the office.
B005HJWWW8|4|Ok some people seemed to be confused with this...<br />The box it comes in IS a cheap thin plastic box saying Fujiyama (thats the &#34;name&#34; of the amp) but this doesn't make the product bad at all. I have to say that charging it completely before even trying it out is very necessary but no worries the charge hold a good amount (2  hours charging and about 10 hours of use). Using it while it is charging does emit some noise but it isn't really a problem since it charges rather fast.<br /><br />So this being my first, I didn't expect how much of a change it would be with my ATH M50s, and I do hear a different but is NOT an immense change like some people say. Notice that this is a really flat amp so with no EQ it won't suddenly change everything about the quality you are getting through your cans. I am also very pleased that I can hear small sounds and details that I could not hear before and nothing is blurred or muddy, very clear. Overall, very nice product and I am very pleased with it.

B002QE3CTY|5|I chose a rating of five stars because this book drew me in. Until The Maze Runner I have not read a book that made my heart race with anticipation.  The characters had their own personality and I especially liked Teresa's attitude towards their situation. I would recommend this book to anybody that enjoys a suspenseful book with some numerous situations, attention grabbing characters, and a very interesting plot.

B000000XB8|5|Great LP. Fantasy vinyl. Three dimensional warm analog sound. It is so much better than anything I have ever heard via any digital media, and I have tried it all: CD's, DVD-A, SACD, Etc. An occassional pop between songs is well worth the price of the sound I get with analog. If you can't tell the difference, then stick to MP3's! It is also flat, which is very importatnt to sound and an issue with many LP manufacturers.

0446556750|5|What I liked so much about this was how Connelly had Harry Bosch as a secondary character in the book and not the main character.  It was strange enough that the lawyer and Bosch were related.  Since I've been reading the Harry Bosch books out of sequence, I'm wondering where in the other Lincoln Lawyer and Harry Bosch books does it go into more details about their relationship.  What can I say....Michael Connelly is magic.

B001GZ6QEC|5|This film is great on so many levels. From the acting to action, the look and the sound, a flawless execution in cinematography. This film was able to make comic book movies a viable threat in the mainstream. My favorite movie over the last decade by far and a must-see for anyone who enjoys action.

B000TDGGVU|5|This book was not only insightful and eloquent, it was fun to read. The list of people I know who would benefit from this book, me being first among them, is long. It's important to note that this is not a self-help book. There are strategies that are offered, but it's main focus is a study of the current human condition.
B003BV8I3Q|5|Clint Eastwood's &#34;Unforgiven&#34;, the major winner of the Academy Awards in 1992 for best director and best film, is good solid film-making. However, &#34;Malcolm X&#34;, produced and directed by Spike Lee and starring Denzel Washington in the title role, is a bona fide masterpiece--a 20th century film equivalent to a masterwork of the Renaissance. Certainly, it may be unfair to evaluate the two films against each other, but since one received much more acclaim than the other during the year of its release, it begs comparison. However, it's like comparing a Caravaggio with Michaelangelo's frescoes atop the Sistine Chapel. The first is certainly exceptional but the latter is a magnum opus. &#34;Malcolm X&#34; is Spike Lee's Sistine Chapel. Like Selznik's &#34;Gone with the Wind&#34; or Welles' &#34;Citizen Kane&#34;, &#34;Malcolm X&#34; may be hard to top.<br /><br />The only thing equally as superb as Washington's acting is the directing and the script, which is at once honest and compelling. Except for a coda at the end that seems at odds with the rest of the film, the script is near perfect, relying heavily on true accounts of Malcolm X's life instead of altering the story to fit prescribed entertainment values, a bad habit of Hollywood filmmakers. Instead, Lee and Washington rely on Malcolm X and his history as the guiding force behind the film. Many of the incidences portrayed in &#34;Malcolm X&#34; actually happened, from his father being assassinated on railroad tracks, to the young Malcolm being involved with drug dealing to his rise as a star among the Nation of Islam, or so-called Black Muslims. In one scene that is history and not fiction, Malcolm X orders his entourage of male associates to stand outside a hospital when a fellow Muslim, Brother Johnson, requires medical attention.<br /><br />Malcolm Little was an African-American, the son of an assassinated preacher whose family had sustained vicious threats from the KKK. As a young man, he relocated to Harlem and became a streetwise hoodlum involved in crime gangs. Racketeering, gambling, prostitution, and drug dealing were his first religion. Then after an incident with white girls that landed himself and his associate Shorty (Spike Lee, perfectly cast) in jail, he meets a member of a new religious organization claiming kinship with Muslims in the Middle East and re-claiming their African roots.<br /><br />Headed by the honorable Elijah Muhammad who had converted to Islam and brought the religion (or at least his version of it) to the United States as the Nation of Islam, the so-called Black Muslims (although they do not refer to themselves as such) lures Malcolm into a new world of honesty, compassion, and purpose. To the their credit, the religious organization gives Malcolm Little, now renamed Malcolm X, a sense of purpose, an identity, a loving community, and rehabilitation from the vices that were destroying himself in Harlem.<br /><br />After his conversion, he becomes a prominent voice among the sect, a spokesperson for the honorable Elijah Muhammad and his message of religious determinism. Simultaneously, they also preach dangerous messages including that all white folks are devils, and that the honorable Elijah Muhammad is to be obeyed without question. As the spokesman of their cause against whites, Malcolm X in some ways becomes the darker side of Martin Luther King, Jr who propagated that proclaiming African-American superiority was as sinful as proclaiming white superiority. The press dubbed Malcolm X the &#34;angriest man in America&#34;.<br /><br />Washington does more than just portray Malcolm X, he becomes him. Washington, I imagine, must have studied footage of his speeches and spoken with people who knew him. Speeches of the real Malcolm X as compared to speeches in the film as enacted by Washington are almost indistinguishable. His performance ranks as one of the top two or three performances by an actor in the history of the performing arts and cinema, up there with Ben Kingsly as Gandhi, Orson Welles as Charles Foster Kane, Laurence Olivier as Hamlet, and Vivian Leigh as Scarlet O'Hara.<br /><br />The turn in the film occurs when, in the wake of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Malcolm makes some ill-conceived remarks to the press. Malcolm X further learns that Elijah Muhammad is not practicing all that he preaches. The star of the so-called &#34;Black Muslims&#34; begins questioning not only his role but the integrity of the entire movement. He then makes a pilgrimage to Mecca, required at least once in the lifetime of a Muslim. His pilgrimage changes many of his views.<br /><br />It's hard to describe this film without using many superlatives, but if there was ever a film that deserved it, it's &#34;Malcolm X&#34;. Washington and Lee do a tremendous job of neither vilifying nor idealizing Malcolm X, the man. In retrospect on the man, I think Malcolm X began to realize he could serve a higher purpose to help unify rather than divide the races. In the end, Malcolm X began to encourage that dream, but, like Martin Luther King Jr, his mission was cut short. As for the film, it is an honest tribute to one of the most memorable figures of American history. And like the man himself, the work may only be appreciated by later generations.

B00J2PCCYQ|3|After many years, I finally get to say a few words about this film. I originally received this &#34;kids'&#34; movie during early screening, back in 1994. I got my copy and headed to the only place for appropriate viewing, the arctic tundra. With me, I brought several jackets, a sweater, five hoodies, three shirts, and no pants. For 10 years, I trekked up the side of the globe to reach the top, only to realize I had misplaced the movie when I had gotten there. On my way back, I stopped by a blockbuster and rented a VHS copy. I scampered home to begin my movie viewing ritual.<br /><br />It started with my re-enactment of the movie Groundhog Day, where every character is a version of Eddie Murphy. Afterwards, I made the necessary sacrifices over the corpses of the damned so I could watch peacefully. Then I made popcorn. Sitting upon my strategically positioned sofa, placed at exactly 47.9 degrees away from the screen, I grabbed the remote for the toaster and pressed play.<br /><br />While the movie was thawing, I happily munched away. When the toaster popped, the disc launched from the toaster into the nearby movie-playing device. Finally I could watch this film of 500 decades in the making.<br /><br />The film administers it's opening in the form of a song. Not knowing the lyrics, I begrudgingly failed to sing along. We are then introduced to the two main characters, Elsa and, her sister, Raquel. Born on the streets of Manhattan, the two sisters constantly fight about who's best friends with the Statue of Liberty.<br /><br />One day they realized that winter was coming, so they partook in the annual village pillage, celebrated by the many citizens of Oregon, in order to please the frozen gods. However, as with Napoleon, the two sisters braved the winter of the north without any logic or reason. Sadly, the latter, middle-half of the film is the two sisters frozen in a snow storm for about sixteen hours.<br /><br />While my eyes wandered from the television, I noticedsomething peculiar. It wasn't just snowing in the movie, it was snowing inside my house! All around me were piles of what seemed to be cocaine. I did the only thing I could do at that moment in time. Continue watching.<br /><br />Eventually, the sisters are thawed out thanks to a friendly eskimo and his moose friend. They decide to go on a double date, which is weird, because one of them is a moose. After dinner, they head back to the eskimo guy's house in Canada. Having never been inside Canada myself, it was interesting to see what exactly it was Canadians did. After entering Canada-Man's house, they started the Maple Syrup bath. They all got in, which was weird, because one of them is a moose.<br /><br />From that point on the movie falls apart. The characters are exaggerated beyond belief, and now the snow in my house was starting to suffocate me. I had to act fast to get out of this one. Since all I could think about was maple syrup, I went to the fridge. Then it hit me. My custom-built lead refrigerator fell on me and I was trapped. My arms instinctively stretched out for the butter. I became defeated when I realized it too was frozen. I sat there like a mother goose waiting for a rock to hatch.<br /><br />This, of course, gave me plenty of time to think back about all of my regrets. Mainly watching this movie. Movie... Movie... Aha! I shifted my body under the weight of a hibernating beluga whale so that I could see the oven. With my last breath, the oven was set to preheat to six hundred degrees. There was no cake to be had, only freedom. As the oven caught on fire, the ice around me melted. Eventually, myself and the fridge were completely submerged. With the added buoyancy, I was now able to easily relieve my body from fridge.<br /><br />I immediately swam to the second floor and pulled the plug from the drain that I put in place for such a situation as this. As the water drained, I could only think of how much trouble this movie has caused me and my family.<br />I cursed this movie with every fiber of my being. After cursing it, I returned it to the video store. I really despise paying late fees.<br /><br />In conclusion, this movie deserves a 3/5. It showed promise in it's morals which it tries to teach kids, but falls short on actually teaching them. This movie may deserve to go in some sort of hall of fame, but certainly not on my bookshelf. If I had a nickel for everytime I wanted to see a movie like this, I'd have about 17 cents. Overall, this film was an unoriginal story told through nostalgia glasses, and only deserves the amount of praise lesser movies often get.
B00C1BU7V8|5|An amazing performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. It had deep insights into the politics and personalities of the Civil War and abolition of slavery.
0767903862|4|I can scarcely remember a book that has made me laugh out loud so many times, and I've read several passages aloud to my spouse.  Overall, I highly recommend it for the same reasons other reviewers do.  The main reason I am writing this review, though, is to warn readers away from the appendix of articles written about the Sydney Olympics.  The articles are overtly anti-American, written with the arrogance of a Yankee liberal who still thinks Boss Hogg is representative of the American south.  I just loved the book, but the appendix nearly ruined it for me.  Their snide tone is quite at odds with the book itself, and they make me reluctant to read Bryson's accounts of travels within the U.S.  And notably, although Bryson brings up the &quot;Aboriginal question&quot; several times in the book, all he can do with it in the articles is mention how Cathy Freeman could be elected pope.  He missed an obvious opportunity to provide a postscript to the book relating how the celebrity of an aboriginal athelete may have impacted the fundamental race problem in Australia.  Do yourself a favor -- read the book, but tear out the appendix!

0060989157|5|This is a killer book both for Crue and non-Crue fans alike!  I read it three times already...each time in a single weekend...YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!  This is a first-hand account of all the sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll you could want written by the baddest of the bad...THE CRUE!  Its a knock-down, drag-out, balls-to-the-wall tale of rock 'n roll excess and mayhem!  Ride shotgun with the Crue through their meteoric rise to the heights of metal Gods...and their downward spiral into the abyss of addiction, infighting, and egomania. <br /> <br />For anyone that ever dreamed of being a rock 'n roll star...this is the book for you!  The four members of the Crue take you through the highest of the highs and the lowest of the lows...and the insane roller coaster ride in between.

0525478817|4|I waited a long time to read this book because it's about kids with cancer, and because I spend a lot of hours in the hospital as part of my job, I typically turn to fiction for an escape. But this book got so many awards, so many stellar reviews, so many accolades, I finally broke down and bought it. And to sum up, I liked it, but didn't love it.<br /><br />The first third of the book was hard for me to get into. I found Augustus grating in a way I can't quite describe, but I'm pretty sure it has something to do with the ridiculously advanced, metaphorical way he speaks (the way all the kids in this book speak, really). I know John Green has said it's something like a grievous sin to talk down to kids in YA literature, and I completely agree with this, but I had to reread quite a few passages to get the gist of what these people were actually talking about. These were not realistic characters, and if Green was going for a lofty series of metaphors rather than real-life experience, than he succeeded. I just found myself constantly yearning for a normal teen. Smart, sure - I love smart, nerdy, overly linguistic teens - but I wish the dialogue and literary ruminations hadn't been so over-the-top.<br /><br />As the story went on, though, it got better. I very much enjoyed the ending, though of course it was sad (this is a cancer book - it's going to be sad). I liked the brutal honesty with which the author and his characters approached such a merciless disease. It made me think about my own mortality; it made me question my own place in this world.  I really felt for Hazel and Gus, but their families' stories were in some ways just as compelling.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for its emotional resonance, but perhaps not for the realistic depiction of teenagers. That said, the way with which John Green navigates humor and tragedy in the context of such heavy subject matter deeply impressed me.
0375701427|5|I loved this book. It shaked me and it hurted me but it gave me real emotions. In a world only made of appearances (you are what you appear) and of superficial relationships this book showed what real life is. Yes, not  everybody has a terrorist as a daughter, but please look into yourself...  how many difficult , unconfessable moments have you encountered in your  life? How many silences ? Roth gives voice to these silences and with a  clear cut description of details shows us the &quot;real&quot; life in  deep.
B006LSZECO|5|A great read.  Didn't know what was going to happen.  Kept you in suspense.
B00AMBK6J2|5|Loved it
B0032Y8XH8|5|Perhaps the BEST ALBUM I have EVER come across!!  There is not even ONE song that I couldn't listen to over and over! Their (very relatable!) folksy music (complete with acoustic guitar & banjo) literally draws the emotions from you! If you like Mumford & Sons at ALL, you should LOVE this album, heart & soul! :)
B000FDECGA|5|A defective samurai and his infant son must battle their way through hordes of ninjas and enemy warriors on the path to destroy their evil shogun leader. SHOGUN ASSASSIN is blood-soaked Japanese cinema at its best, taking the classic samurai Action/Adventure premise and pushing it to the limits of extreme violence and gore. The Americanized version of the film released in 1980 is actually an amalgamation of the first and second films from the LONE WOLF AND CUB series, removing much of the slower exposition from each in order to increase the rapid-fire action sequences. Wakayama's stern, calculated performance as the vengeful Ogami is one of the film's greatest strengths, lending credibility to the role even after much of the character's background had been stripped away. SHOGUN'S exaggerated comic book framing and fight choreography make every fight fresh and engaging, while the geysers of blood, severed heads, and flying limbs make this the perfect stepping stone to draw Horror purists into the excessive world of Asian action and gore that would inspire filmmakers like Quentin Tarentino for decades to follow.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

I believe this is not good music to listen for, but study for. Music for the soul, he knows what he is doing... Waking up people, fixing and giving strength to all of those who listen.<br /><br />Take advantage of your musical choices and pick something that would program your brain to think positively...

0385040253|5|I am an Eagle Scout and was once called Mr. Knott.  I enjoyed tying knots and practiced doing it as a young man.  In the day, no one could tie knots faster than me.  Now, as an adult, I do not have a need to tie knots or work with rope and other lines as often as I once did, but have an appreciate for those who can.  Knowing how to tie property knots is a lost art.  This is an excellent reference and one that I hope to pass on to the next generation.  This is an excellent reference that deserves a prominent location in any library.

0375842209|5|I can't remember reading a book as captivating as this one by Markus Zusak. I read it for the first time borrowed from my local public library, then wanted to have a personal copy to re-read and loan to friends. It's that intriguing. My sister who loves to read in Shreveport, LA told me about it. i talked about it to friends in Haverhill,MA. We read it and it is now on the recommended summer reading list for students at Haverhill High School.  So much the better!<br />I bought a used paperback edition, it was perfect for my needs.

B0073ODRKG|5|... and I assume that's coming later (and when it does, Warner Bros, you better do a true box set justice, not another cheap job like this.  Start with the gayest design company you can find so the box won't be as tacky as this one... fire whatever boring ass chick came up with this cover artwork and dulled out gold design).  BUT in the meantime it's a nice little collection for die hard fans, a good way to look back and even re-discover the CDs that were considered disappointments but are actually quite wonderful (see \\"American Life\\").  The little cardboard covers are cool enough since we're all sick of that plastic piling up in landfills and it's nice to have them all in one place, just like my Smiths box set.  There's nothing new here but get it for the right price (see the Marketplace) and it's a good deal for fans -- or their offspring who need introduction to one of the great pop stars.
B00003Q438|1|The Abyss is a continuation of that on-going, pathetic, story in the American filmmaking industry commonly known to most people by its nickname- &quot;Hollywood&quot;... an assembly of very talented actors whose talents  are unfortunately wasted under the direction of an incompetent director-  this time it's James Cameron. Add in the $$million$$ dollar special effects  extravaganza to the immature script, cheesy &quot;feel-good&quot;  soundtrack, and cheesy dialogue leading up to the very cheesy ending, and  what we have here is an underwater tear-jerker epic in the making(no, it's  8 years too early for Titanic)....The Abyss. I would've given it  &quot;2&quot; stars, but they had to re-release the &quot;Director's  Cut&quot; version, which made it even worse. Therefore, I am compelled to  give it a rating of &quot;1&quot; (only because &quot;0&quot; is not  allowed here). To me, there are 2 types of &quot;Director's Cut&quot;. 1.  The addition of footage that was cut out, because it was considered too  explicit by the censors. 2. The addition of footage that was shot, but  wasn't included due to time constraints. The Abyss falls under neither  category, with the end product adding nothing more than very bad outtakes  of Ed Harris mumbling to himself in place of the aliens so that we know  their(the aliens) true intentions on earth. People watching the  &quot;Director's Cut&quot; for the first time who have already seen the  regular version won't be surprised at all by how the plot turns out in the  predictably weak &amp; all-too simple of a script. If James Cameron had any  brains at all, he would've anticipated that someday there would be a demand  for a &quot;Director's Cut&quot;, and brought the actors back into the  studio even after the film's release to shoot the necessary scenes to give  it more cohesion for a future release. Not slop in a bunch of mediocre  outtakes and say &quot;Ok, here's my masterpiece the way it was intended to  be seen. Blah, blah, blah...&quot;. If anything, The Abyss is eye candy to  dazzle 12-year olds and nothing more.
B00104QSOM|2|The movie itself is great, but provided you don't scratch it while removing it from the luxurious cardboard slip case, you'll just crush the flimsy outer cardboard case it comes in. Really just detracts so much from the movie. For the price you would think the packaging would be substantially better.

B00HBQWGXK|5|It is Jack Reacher in his elements and he's still that unconventional trouble shooter!!<br />Reacher may be out of his depths amidst the modern technologies employed in the tale, yet he shows his personal abilities are what matters!!<br />Lee Child brings his story telling ability to a higher level with the story line set about a purported assassination attempt against the very top of the political hierarchy of the G8 nations.<br />Yet it is a believable tale, fast moving until its climax -then reality set in and I have to admit, Child has again proven himself the master story teller he is!! It is really a personal story about Jack Reacher!!

0547260695|5|Bought this for a friend who is a huge fan and collector of this book. We both LOVED it! The book is beautiful and true to the original illustrations. I really cant think of anything negative about this purchase.
B00KWVZ750|3|A good kids game
B001NLKXK2|5|A wonderful, sad book that informs the reader of the the effects of Alzheimer's on the whole family.
B005SFR7YE|5|I truly love this version of The Phantom. The sound and the production were outstanding. You can't go wrong with this purchase.
B00DR0PDNE|1|If you like being stuck in a cattle chute and forced to the purchase counter, then this is the one for you. No other choice, no other selection. Sucks.
031606792X|5|Isn't this what everyone wanted? A perfect ending? Well thats what we got. Well all except those \\"Team Jacob\\" fans :) I enjoyed this whole series of books, some of it kind of dragged in the middle. Took me off guard to see Book 2 \\"Jacob\\" it was nice to see things from his point of view even though I was not a big fan of his since he was just a big jerk a lot of the time. Bella choose what she wanted and that was to live forever with her Edward. So she got pregnant, big whoop. Its a fantasy and I think a lot of people are taking it way to literal. I loved how all the covens came together to witness baby Renesmee. I particularly love the name, it's different and unquie and whats wrong with that? Get over it.     The book had it's high points and low points, yes, but what book doesn't?     People bring up college - she can still go to college, not human of course, but she can still go and learn what she wants.    Poeple bring up the fact that she got pregnant at 18, as sad as this is to say I bet there are more 18 year olds out there pregnant than we even know about, again its a book and it's fiction. Stop acting as if this was real life.     Lastly, again I'd like to say I throughly enjoyed this book and the whole series of books. Stephenie Meyer did an excellent job. If you go to her website you will read that she just kind of fell into this writing thing. She had a dream, woke up in the middle of it wanting to know how it ended. She did a superb job. Im 27, and enjoyed every last minute of it. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time wanting to know more and was sad to put the book down because I had to work or sleep :) I can't wait for Midnight Sun and Twilight the movie to come out!!
B00I6IKSZ0|3|I like local multi player and zombie killing and all but the world wide I do not do because you can be hacked and reported which you can not play pixel gun after you have been reported. So try not to be reported
B005LAJ22Q|5|My family and I have been fans of the show since it started. We bought the first season, so when I asked my child what she wanted for Christmas this year, this was one of the first items on her list, so we got it for her. There was no question or hesistation.  I know when she opens it, she will love it.  Items shipped quickly, it came when I was told, and packaging was perfect.
B00AYQNOU8|5|Lush and lovely with a sense of loneliness and beautiful contemplation.
B000063DHK|5|I actually traded a buddy of mine a couple of \\"men's magazines\\" for the original vinyl record when I was thirteen and just starting to play bass guitar. This was the first rock record I had ever heard where the bass was actually mixed up front and audible... I pretended to be sick for two weeks so that I could stay home from school and practice along with it. Seventeen years later, I still get the most intense rush from listening to it-- the energy is just astonishing. I can't listen to Maiden's studio albums anymore-- they're just too cheesy for me to actually sit through-- but this one deserves a place on my shelf because it is just so amazing. I never get sick of it. If you're any kind of Iron Maiden fan, you should already own and worship this album. Conversely, if you've never heard their music (were you born under a rock?), this will spoil you rotten and you'll probably never like any of the rest of their stuff. I like how someone called this the \\"live best-of compilation\\". To my mind, that is entirely accurate.... I just can't recommend this album highly enough. Five stars.
B00E8B1P9M|1|No character development. Story is &#34;thin&#34; and all over the place. Should have read the reviews before I ordered it.
B001H5X7KC|5|My wife said this was the funniest Ben Stiller movie she'd ever seen.  I don't know if I'd agree with that completely, but it's one of his best, as a director or star.  \\"Tropic Thunder\\" begins with fake trailers for fake movies and fake products of the characters, and play like bits from the old \\"Ben Stiller Show\\" on Fox.  (You remember, right?  From around 1990?  10 pm on Sundays?  With \\"Flying Blind,\\" it was the funniest hour on TV.)      Then the movie kicks into gear.  Imagine a loopy \\"Hearts of Darkness\\" with some fake blood and guts, and you get the general idea.  While Stiller, Downey and company keep the plot moving, Tom Cruise steals the show as the demented, over-the-top studio head.  As much as I don't care for many of his off-screen antics and causes, he has to get credit where credit is due.  Nick Nolte and Matthew McConaghy also do very well with the small amount of screentime they get.  The plot progresses pretty much as you would expect, with some funny surprises along the way.      \\"Tropic Thunder\\" is not for the easily offended, and is not suitable for young children.  This may be why this movie garners so many 1 star reviews.  But if you don't mind a little offensiveness in the service of excellent comedy, you will probably like this film.  It's at least worth a rent.
B008M721MS|4|not sure if it works  yet. I hope it does so I can talk to friends and family on here
B0000AR8NK|4|Reality is a great escape.  The vocals are amazing and the hooks are addictive.  Bowie is a timeless legend and will always make great music.  I love that this album is outside the box and that the songs hit you.  The guitar rifts and editing are amazing.  The songs all belong together on this album and the sound is intoxicating.  The best songs are &quot;New Killer Star&quot; and &quot;Days&quot;.  &quot;New Killer Star&quot; has a driving beat and origanlity.  &quot;Days&quot; is a song that haunts you and the chord changes are so fluent.  The whole album is a detour from the usual.  This is music.
B003FSTN7A|5|I was dissappointed with the fifth season. This year (6) is outstanding! From the family plot, the insights into serial killers, and especially the outstanding acting by the star and all the others. The details and suprise endings make every episode compelling from start to finish.
B008JFUPK8|5|I have to admit that I was a little frustrated after the first time I watched this movie. I have come to realize however, that every movie with Christopher Nolan's name attached, has taken me a few watches to appreciate. After the 2nd and 3rd time, I saw all the little things that make this movie much more artful than people realize. I can understand why some people don't like it, because it is very deep. There is a lot of CGI, which could be considered good or bad, but there is definitely a darker aspect to this superman.
B009UX2YAC|4|It works great on my kindle. It glitches on my phone though.
B0058UXHHK|3|The writing was not fantastic.  Story line was mediocre and slightly boring.  I wouldn't recommend.  The outcome of the story was predictable.
B00BGI086Q|5|Very fast shipping, and as advertised.
B006FO3ERQ|5|I really loved this engaging novel, with very interesting characters, & descriptive geography. It kept me wanting for the story to never end!
B00ADS98FC|5|Great movie....funny and entertaining!  Loved the music too...watched it several times and found things I missed each time. Recommend it!
B00JGMK6VG|5|Probably my favorite of the Marvel movies to date.  I love how they aren't making super hero movies for the sake of fanboys, but telling the stories in cinematic genres (this reminded me of some of the great spy thrillers from the 70s and 80s).  Great film!
B000RZGFYS|5|This single album influenced more musicians than any other album I know of.  Probably hundreds of bands sprung up trying to play music in this style, which is really like Venom on steroids.  And, though the music is aggressive, a musician should be able to appreciate it for its talent.  There are entire record labels that came to specialize in this style of music, and of course Venom are bastards of a songs like Children of the Grave by Black Sabbath.  We all get our ideas from somewhere!  However, Venom is nowhere near as good as this album.  I find no weakness on Reign in Blood, though some tracks are better than others.  My favorite use of this album is to listen to it from start to finish!  Angel of Death, and Raining Blood are standards in the genre.  Sure, there have been albums put out since it that have been better, but it was an original in its time, and nearly impossible to compare anything to it in greatness.  My favorite review of this album actually came from a guitar magazine well over 10 years ago that said something like, \\"Reign in Blood burns with the intensity of 10,000 suns.\\"
B0017SWPXY|5|I really loved this book. It is a book for any type of reader. An easy read and a lovely story.
B00E8KLWB4|5|Great game. Keeps you going
B00008LOS1|5|What more can be said about this universally lauded Who album? Although my personal favorite is Sell Out, Who's Next contains all the group's most famous classics (the kinds of songs one would be most likely to hear on an FM classic rock station... or  a commercial). Highly recommended. The bonus tracks are also great in this edition.
B00IINPXLW|5|I played this game at the behest of my 4 year old son. I guess he was attracted to the icon character. Now both of us play it. The game starts out easy and gets progressively hard as you go through the levels. Cut the Rope 2 goes beyond just cutting the rope by adding new &#34;helper&#34; characters to more complex puzzles. Beware - this game can be addicting!
B00JOT3HQ2|5|My teen and daughter LOVE this game and they kept asking me over and over to get it so I did they played it for hour after hour once they even played it all night so I know they love this app :D
B00005JKOV|2|I feel somewhere in between of giving this film 2 or 3 stars. It's a commendable experiment, a very original movie, and for that I would give it 3 stars. But for all of that, it is ultimately a movie I didn't enjoy much. So that's why I gave it 2 stars. Read on for further thoughts...<br />First, the animation. It's amazing. It's interesting to see how it changes from scene to scene, giving it different moods for different characters. The extreme distortions in one, for example, are very engaging. Yet I have a little but. The truth is the different parts (backgrounds, characters, objects) bounce around a little bit throughout the whole film. This is certainly interesting and goes well with what the movie is trying to convey, but I can't help getting a little bit dizzy about it all, and I think it would have been much better if this 'bounziness' (for lack of a better word) would have been used sporadically. That would have been much more effective. The same goes, for example, for the extreme distortions previously mentioned. They are repeated throughout a long dialogue where all we see is that face being contorted and distorted over and over again. But despite all the minor complaints, animation is excelent, and will have you glued into the screen for some time.<br />Then, the plot or, better said, the dialogues. The idea of the movie was promising, and I really wanted to like this movie. But the fact that it has no plot whatsoever puts the whole of the importance on the dialogues. And the truth is that some really succeed in making you think, whilst most are simply... boring. They start repeating themselves and going off to places that don't make any sense at all (unless you're high, I guess). It's just so many 'profound' reflections that don't actually have any meaning, any substance behind them. There's mainly questions asked in this movie. Don't expect any anwers. And although I think that could be a good thing, after the first 30 minutes, it all gets boring andrepetitive. And it goes on way too long after that. The other thing I didn't really like was the 'plot developments'. They were waaaaay too predictable. Like when Wiggins is told 'You can tell you're in a dream when you try to switch off a light and the light stays on'. I expected this would occur sometime later in the movie. It would have a bit of expectation. But it happens right after they finish speaking. One way or another, I figured they would show us this whole film was a dream, but I though it would have been interesting to give some suspense to this, or to give the feeling that maybe some of it was dream while some might have been reality. The ending was very predictable as well. When I saw him starting to fly off and reach for the car again (and because of the time I knew the end was near), I automatically knew he would fly off and the movie would end.<br />The music, however, is something entirely different. Glover Gill composed a poignant and engaging score. The tango music fits perfectly the film and the questioning it's trying to get through, and I thought the music scenes were some of the best parts of the movie itself (especially the one in the Ritz in Austin, where they are dancing tango, towards the end).<br />In the end, Waking Life is a worthy experiment, but the end result is not as good as I would've liked it to be. I think this could have worked much better as a short, but I guess it wouldn't have had so much attention and success. The animation and music are top-notch, but the film becomes quite boring after the first half-hour, except for a few interesting dialogues.
B004SYP5WC|5|Easier then using calendar and unclutters the calendar from my repeat reminders making that easier to read and sort through.
B000NY12LO|5|This was a great story, unfortunately, what we have seen to many times recently.  Love the way she describes each  of her characters and then blends them together at the end.  I was keep in total suspense throughout the book. Great writer!
B00L9B7IKE|3|this is a real beach type book, and you can devour it in a couple of sittings, probably knowing soon after beginning who do it!
B00CBU7640|5|Simple and to the point, valuable lessons. Loved them when I was a kid, and happy to share them with my children :)
B00V4JJFN4|4|Very good movie, a bit long in parts but that is to be expected from a trilogy of movies made from one book.
0143038419|5|This book has helped shape my life. Elizabeth constantly reminds me of myself, all the anxious, social, romantic, emotionalness that is her personality. I have been inspired by this book to take up meditation and to explore myself and my relationship with God more deeply.    Some people hate this book, which  baffles me, but I feel sorry for them that they are unable to understand the spiritual beauty of it.  Their hearts and minds are closed, and they do not want to be changes.    Read this book if you are open and want to become closer to yourself and to God. This story is not about travel and adventure, but about becoming a better person and growing close to God and our true selves.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|just like flappy bird pretty cool game. its free. so hey why not. check it out and download it. its fun
B00DJFIMW6|1|Does not load easily. When it does, the game is fragmented and when not fragmented, boring. Four more words required.
B007IXWKUK|5|I watched the movie with my wife but wow this 3 book series so much better.
B000001EAQ|5|First of all, let's clear up a few myths about this album: 1:  Pop is not  a techno album - at least no more than Achtung Baby or Zooropa are techno  albums.  Unlike its misguided sister record, David Bowie's  &quot;Earthling,&quot; Pop uses electronic beats surprisingly sparingly,  and has a less sterile feel than either of its two immediate predecessors.  2:  Pop is not a pop album.  While some songs are obviously singles, the  majority are not so accessible.     While critics and fans never seem to  tire of panning this one, it has a few things that set it apart from their  other albums.  First of all, it is entirely without throwaway or  &quot;clone songs&quot; (by this I mean the embarrassing similarities  between All I Want is You and For the First Time, The Fly and Acrobat,  etc.)  Even the weaker songs have many redeeming qualities, and the album  grows with each successive listening.  The criticisms of its lyrical  content continue to puzzle me, they don't seem to be altogether different  than the trademark mix of social irony, conscience, and Irish  nationalism/Catholicism that cover most of their albums (However, there is  one glaring error, Bono's description of &quot;Southern accents&quot; in  Miami; we do not have Southern accents).  Granted, the album does not have  a song that is as majestic as &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot; or  &quot;New Year's Day,&quot; but tracks like &quot;Discotheque,&quot;  &quot;Do You Feel Loved,&quot; and &quot;Last Night on Earth&quot; all rank  among U2's best.  Don't believe the anti-hype; give this album a chance and  don't worry about being burned at the stake for saying it's better than  Achtung Baby or The Joshua Tree.
B0086700CM|5|If you have time to kill this game is just right! You can play it where ever you wish! Like on the school bus. At lunch. And when you are waiting at the doctor's! Its the best!
B00BMT9C84|3|This was a good clean, funny movie to watch. Good for all ages. Not the typical comedy from Seth but he did make it pretty funny.
B0000CABBW|4|When I first saw this movie, I was enchanted by the performance of Keisha Castle-Hughes and fully appreciated her struggle to be recognized as a leader of her Maori community.  Upon seeing it again a year later I realized how abusive Pai's relationship with her grandfather is.  When a twelve-year old girl feels she must sacrifice her life in order to realize her destiny and win the respect of her grandfather, this is not a vision quest but suicide.<br />So many young girls today sacrifce who they really are in the name of societal beauty and cultural acceptance.  Thousands of years ago, in the story of Abraham and Isaac, Abraham was stopped from sacrificing his own son to fulfill his destiny with Yahweh.  This was a crucial mark of difference between the early Hebrew faith and other tribal religions in Mesopotamia, that there would be no child sacrifice to appease gods or ancestors.  Children were now the vessel through which the promise of God would be fulfilled.  Later a man named Jesus of Nazareth would be crucified for his passion to live in the love of God the Creator so completely.  But he was a man, an adult who could make decisions for his own life.  A twelve year old girl is still a child; on the brink of womanhood but a child nonetheless.<br />To uphold this movie as a role model for other young girls (and boys) is wonderful up until the last few scenes.  I apologize for the spoiler content in this review but I feel strongly about the mixed message this movie gives.  Perhaps I am imposing my Western, 21st century point of view upon an indigenous culture, but how does this message translate to young teens facing adversity and lack of acceptance from peers and possibly family?<br />This movie is all about keeping tradition but also about making changes to move into the future. Yet Pai's sacrifice is something of the ancient world, not the one she hopes to lives in.  When watching this movie with your teenage children, talk with them about how they see Pai and could there have been an alternative ending, another solution to the impass between Pai and her grandfather.
B006ATJXQW|5|I read the series first, thought I was done but then saw this. I was happy to have just a little more ...good read
B00AREIAI8|5|I really enjoy this game. The energy recharge time is reasonable and the amount of energy needed to complete tasks is also very reasonable. The amount of jewels needed to get things is pretty fair.
B007VTUYWW|5|Its a fun movie with great action and Angelina Jolie does a great job saving the world from disaster.  I like that the hero is a female for a change.
B0054TKAZW|4|Overall, I like it.  Scott's kind of rediculous (and the Scott/Allison thing is a little over the top--in a way that feels that it can't be anything but purposeful) but overall I really enjoyed the show and the format of an ongoing story arc versus a Monster-of-the-Week type of seasonal story. Some of the other characters who I either didn't like at first or was indifferent about began to grow on me, so...
B00F91SCXC|3|Not enough gore man!!!! geeeeezzz... they act like they're gonna show something.... and then.... NOTHING! Best part.... &#34;the train is in the station!&#34; lol
B00QW8TYWO|5|This game very fun I love it
B001OGWY1W|5|Loved this movie...! Heath Ledger's performance complimented Christian Bale's Batman! I purchased this movie for my grandson, who is an extreme Batman fan!
B00BAXFECK|5|This is a wonderful novel.  Donna Tartt is the most incredible author.  Her use of language is awesome!!  I loved this books so much I limited the number of pages I would allow myself to read in order to make last.  The characters are people you feel you know.  This book is filled with important life lessons
B001EC0OMM|4|I enjoyed this movie immensely. The characters were simple and charming, the storyline was interesting considering the period of time, and the outcome was only slightly predictable.
B000009QPE|5|the seminal godhood of this album cannot be overstated. It simply slaughters anything in its path - i even put it on after Cannibal corpse bloodthirtst and it blew it away. Angel of death is the most intense,  extreme song EVER recorded period. The riff after the bridge is probably  the best thrash riff ever. The epic raining blood contains the greatest  ever intro. Master of puppets cannot even compare to this in any way - The  only thing Metallica ever had over Slayer was Cliff. I cannot recommend  this album enough, it is still just as powerful and raw today. I don't  often give five stars but this album deserves 10. No one ever will ever  come close to even TOUCHING this epic ever again. This is THE album to get  if you are tired of Korn Slipknot and Limp and other such trendy trash.  Someone wrote in a cannibal corpse review that he thinks people who think  Slayer+Megedeth heavy are laughable - I think that in the case of Megadeth  this is true but this album absolutely represents the epitome of heaviness  - own it and it will own you.
B00M14I9VU|3|Dmitri Tcherniakov, the producer, set himself to create a dramatic opera of Prince Igor.  Borodin never finished the opera, nor was it totally clear what the real dramatic message he intended to deliver, so Mr. Tcherniakov’s intent is certainly not misplaced. The questions are did he achieve his goal with this production, and was it worth it.<br />I would argue that the dramatic effect of the opera is still not the best characteristic of this opera.  The characters don’t evolve much between start and finish. In fact, with the exception of Prince Igor it seems all the characters are what they are from the onset.  Prince Igor suffers from extreme depression for most of the opera and his supposed change at the end is so short that it becomes irrelevant.  More traditional productions put the emphasis on the music and the spectacle. What is wrong with just beautiful music and some colorful spectacle and dances?  Do we need to have a deep, somber and dramatic theme to enjoy an opera?  The famous Polovtsian Dances are the most disappointing scenes of all, in fact the dancers looked to me as a bunch of “Smiling Zombies”.<br />The effort to make a dramatic opera of Prince Igor succeeded only in part, while I don’t believe it is worth the effort.  In addition, I feel somehow offended when a producer makes a time transposition of an epic opera, in this case from the XII century to communist Russia, to make it more real.  I can still relate to human emotions even when they happened many centuries ago…<br />The music aspects of this production are to be commended. Abdrazakov, and Dyka are very good singers and a delight to listen to.  The total ensemble is very good, including the chorus and the orchestra. Musically, this Blue-Ray is worthwhile.<br />I do recommend it, but only if you have seen a more traditional production first.
B002MFWLXK|5|Based on the indisputable evidence conveyed in this film (the Zapruder film being the most telling), it is quite clear to any reasonable human being that the official story on the Kennedy assassination is ridiculous. There is no way that a lone gunman, regardless of his shooting capabilities could have discharged the supposed assassination rifle three times in the recorded time period from the supposed position is ridiculous. It's shocking that an entire nation fell for such a ludicrous proposition but with so many agents working to make this story the truth from the FBI to President Johnson to military officials, it's no wonder it happened. And as the film points out with so many agents acting surreptitiously for a given end, it is by definition a conspiracy—not a conspiracy theory, a conspiracy fact.<br /><br />The conclusion that this Jim Garrison purported and that this film reinforces is that the motive behind such a dastardly plot is that the assassination was a coup d'etat in which the military industrial complex took out an obstacle to its war profiteering by killing Kennedy. After all, Kennedy had order a troop reduction in Vietnam and shortly after Johnson took office, he reversed this decision and led the country into a bloodbath costing America 60,000 young men and over a trillion dollars (in today's money).<br /><br />The film is expertly written, directed, and acted and it drives the unsettling prospect that the United States is hardly a nation of, for, and by the people, but rather is controlled by shadowy conspirators in the military industrial complex. It is a must-see during a time of out-of-control government and a lawless world.
B00K0OI42W|5|Still a great book after all these years.
B007FG9LIE|3|I can't say this is a bad book but it's definitely not what I thought it was going to be.  I enjoyed reading it and it kept me on the edge of my seat but the way it ended was a little strange for me.  Not sure f I will read the others.
B00T3DNKIE|5|I loved this just as much as Mockingbird.  Neither Scout or Atticus disappointed me.  If you loved Mockingbird you will love this book.
B0035G9ABQ|5|I got this album and I loved it pretty much from the start, the pictures the Gorillaz \\"paint\\" with sound have always been great, but this album is particularly good because of the large number of famous guest stars. Each song has its own unique styling because of the sound the guest artist was going for, but all of the songs have classic Gorillaz undertones.
B0058VW36U|5|My 7 year old loves to play this game, but sometimes he wants me to watch, and I get into it too :)  It's cute to watch him have to strategize a little and the Om Nom character is adorable and silly.

B0015OKWL2|1|Ah, I just couldn't wait to buy this movie - De Niro, Pacino!  What could possibly go wrong?  Answer: everything!<br /><br />Take a bad script, add a narrator, and then throw in a few B-level actor wannabes and you have a disaster on film.  This movie is so predictable and boring that I can only imagine Robert and Al were heavily medicated for head colds when they agreed to take lead roles in this project.<br /><br />If it had been any other actors, this movie would have been stopped in the middle of production.  However, many people actually give this movie high ratings, here at Amazon.com, because they know the amazing track record for the two big leaguers!  And I truly can't blame them for that.  Pacino or De Niro sitting in a rocking chair for thirty minutes would probably be a bit interesting, because these two have that IT factor.<br /><br />Two very old, white, NYPD detectives fall under every single clich&eacute; ever invented about cops.  Then they work out in the police weight training room, shoot lots of bullets at targets, talk trash, brag on each other, fight with the younger cops, stand up to the black street thug, and along the way discover they have a vigilante in their midst; wow, how will the audience ever handle the suspense.  Easy, there is none.  In fact, there really isn't a single character in this movie who I found myself rooting for to succeed.  I was actually hoping they all got shot!  Sorry, just being brutally honest; everyone seemed corrupt, arrogant, and void of any good human qualities.<br /><br />Righteous Kill is one of those movies that everyone hoped would live up to the hype.  But when you rely on a cool musical soundtrack and two great movie stars to carry the whole project, you are going to create a mess.  And that is exactly the best way to describe this movie:  A MESS.<br /><br />And CASTING DIRECTORS, please stop putting 50 Cent in movies!  He should not even be an extra in a film.  He cannot act!  He's not even good enough to convince an audience he is a rapper, and he is.<br /><br />Don't believe the hype.  Save your money and 101 minutes of your time.<br /><br />Want suspense and characters you care about?  Watch Bangkok Dangerous!  Now that's a script!<br /><br />See ya next review!is.

0307588335|1|I could barely make it through the first 50 pages of this book because, from the start, the author seemed like an insufferable know-nothing who saw a chance to cash in on the demise of his old firm.  I don't have an axe to grind with Lehman, the government, other banks or anyone else for that matter, but I turned to this book hoping for an interesting and clear insider explanation of Lehman's failure.  Instead, I got a poorly written, self-serving account that didn't go beyond what I could have cobbled together from various Wall Street Journal and New York Times stories.  Thank goodness I checked it out from the library and didn't pay for this book in any other currency than the time I can never get back.
B0076XIS4O|3|Everyone can admit, Grimes is the most adorable little pop star since, wait, has anyone been able to make music so cute yet so serious before? I suppose you could cite Barbie Girl by Aqua as a prime example, revolutionary for Grimes style. The Cocteau Twins also come to mind when listening. In simple terms, the sweetest bubble gum in the most vivid dream pop universe.

B000ELJBAK|5|\\"David Gilmour\\" stands head and shoulders above either of Gilmour's other solo CDs. Throughout the set list, Gilmour is in consistently fine form, and shows off his chops not only on guitar and vocals but also as a surprisingly competent piano player. Strong songs focus both Gilmour's singing and instrumental prowess, and this disc collects most of his strongest solo material. Most of this album can easily hold its own against much of Pink Floyd's output, and it's by far the best of any of Gilmour's attempts at solo success. When I bought this CD I listened to it at least once nightly for over two weeks and not once did I skip through the songs. That is how good this CD is. There are no big-name guest stars here and no gimmicks - only Gilmour with some very capable support on drums and bass.    There are no bonus tracks. Given that Gilmour is a perfectionist, that isn't surprising. I, for one, would rather hear a strong album the way that it was originally intended rather than dilute it with needless outtakes or demos. If Gilmour doesn't want them here, he has his reasons and I respect them.    Listening to this CD, I had a new appreciation for just how fine a craftsman David Gilmour can be. Everyone recognizes his gifts as a lead guitarist, but he's also a solid songwriter and his arranging skills are sublime. Try this CD, and you might find yourself glad that \\"There's No Way Out Of Here!\\"
B00IRMQADY|5|We were prepared not to like this movie, suspecting that it might turn out to be a propaganda piece put out by those seeking reparations for slavery of generations past, but, while this depicts the worst aspects of that period, it does it well, keeping the viewer intensely interested in the characters throughout. Seeing Brad Pitt enter the scene toward the end of the piece was a bit off-putting, as we're all used to seeing him in a more major part, but lest you wonder, he still plays &#34;the good guy.&#34; Keeping in mind that some of the slave owners treated their people more humanely (if one can ever say that when slavery is involved), such putative owners are nearly completely absent from this work. One who seems to be such, has to sell his due to financial hardship. Nevertheless, the film does a good job of giving the viewer a sense of what it was like to live in that period.
B00GFOIUVQ|4|This game made me go out and get a kindle just so I could play it on a bigger screen and wow l'm glad I did
B0084U0IEG|4|I liked the stories within the story and the twist at the end--which I should really have seen coming. The language is beautiful, as always, with Ian McEwan
B0064JV4LU|5|Not what I expected, a total smile!  it will have you laughing and even shedding a tear.  only the French, a truly beautiful movie! enjoy!<br />guys, close to a chick flick but not, note it will work as one in your favor!!!
0920668372|1|This book is downright creepy.  The only morals I can see in this book is that it's important to set firm boundaries with your parents and that you'll be on your death bed by the time you see your first grandchild if you wait till your 40s to reproduce.  I think there's a few pages missing in the middle too, after the mother keeps sneaking through the window of her grown son's house to rock him at night there has to be a side story where the police show up after the neighbors saw her or something about how he had to take a second job to pay for all the therapy he needed after she walked in on him and some chick getting it on.<br /><br />In addition to making any adult want to scream \\"BAD TOUCH!\\" the books freakishly catchy writing will have your child bring it back to you over.  And over.  And over.  Leaving you in the uncomfortable position of having to decide between breaking it to your kids that you won't read it anymore because it's basically a PBS special on unhealthy parent child relationships or burying it beneath the moldly lasagne in the trash after they're in bed and claiming you don't know where it is the next day.
B00IX9UPV4|4|Love it , t.y.
1439156816|5|I didn't realise that Stephen King had such a good sense of irony.  His autobiography at the start of this book, which he says is not an autobiography, is very revealing and entertaining.  Not being a fan of horror, I've never read any of his books but was surprised by his wit.  I am not sure if he writes horror in the same way.  This book on writing was a surprise!
B00MUCX6AW|4|I like the concept and the story is good. BTW I like first person shooter games and this movie does a good job of using that 'respawn' concept.
B0000584V3|5|I remember the first time I heard this album... I had heard a bit of Morningrise before but it never hooked me like this... I heard the Leper Affinity twice in a row... then bought the album the next day... and the rest is history.<br />Ever wonder why this band has become so popular? Well, maybe because they are THAT GOOD. Blackwater Park is a perfect album in my opinion... a title that not even any of their other releases can touch. Each track is an opus of beautifully dark and heavy riffs, melodic riffs, mood shifts, and a haunting atmosphere throughout. This is in part helped by Steven Wilson's excellent production... not too clean, and not too muddy... the guitars are all layered perfectly. <br />One key word for this album is ATMOSPHERE. For example, when listening to Harvest, I can't help but to think of fall, greens and browns, and fallen leaves... the song definately has that vibe to it.<br />Bleak is a track that is so epic, heavy, and melodic at the same time... an instant classic. Dirge For November is one of my favorite songs EVER... an amazingly soft and unsettling intro leads into a heavy, dreamlike storm of emotion... listen to both of the guitars at once, its brilliant... the song ends with a minimalist light outro... very effective... and the closer, Blackwater Park, is a 12 minute epic of immense proportions... the song contains a dreamy soft part with some eerie voices passing by in the background... and then hammers away with one of the most massive, intense intense riffs ever... and all hell breaks loose for the rest of the song, which results in an exhausting, intense end like nothing else.<br />As for that recent review by parabolak, why wouldn't you want to have these two styles of melody and aggresion blended together? It works so well, and it has been proven with albums like this... If you admit that you are not a fan of either styles of metal, then why should you bother going on about how YOU feel they don't go well together?<br />This album gets my vote for greatest album of all time. I know people throw that around a lot, but I really mean it. I absolutely love music, and no album has touched me or affected me quite as much as this one has. I know it has for many people. Maybe it will do the same to you.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Another great Grisham read!  Wonderful character development and flow.  It is always disappointing to reach the end of a well written story...

B00N6PD3GE|1|So little time, so much misery. It was kind of fun reading about the anticipation of the various individuals who embarked on this crossing, and even the discussion of the German submarine commander showed an interesting degree of humanity. Once the Lusitania was hit with the torpedo, the delight was irrevocably gone. It was simply mass murder. Grotesque in the telling, there was no pleasure in reading the accounts of how all these people died.
0440219078|5|A fantastic future world creation.  Young and old alike will enjoy this amazing vision.  The young narrator lives in a community of the future where all citizens are selected for their jobs and trained at the age of 13.  There is no choice in this society but thereby also no haves and havenots.  The citizens live happily in their roles and don't question what they have or what they don't have.  Because everyone, everything is the same.  No one has ever known suffering or hunger or need, but in having never known it, they don't even know what it is.  When he is selected as the receiver of memories, our narrator realizes that the world has not always been the way it is.  And in so learning, he starts to question whether everything is always for the best.<br />An amazing work that will make you think about society, community, risk, and choice.  Will spark many deep thoughts and discussion.  A great read that will definitely make you think about society, structure, and opportunity.

B004J4WNL2|4|I am an introvert. I have known that for years. I have punished myself because I was not as successful as others. This book gave me a reason for thoughts I had/have. Now I need to test them.  The last couple of chapters disappointed me. Not the strong finish that I expected and wanted. Still well worth the time to read.
B00E9ZATJO|5|My 9 yr old son loved this for Christmas!
B006BGZJJ4|5|Loves it
B008UCJ7KO|3|It was good and had some hot and heavy parts....but it was just missing that excitement and drama of the first two. Luckily this is kind of a middle book...so I assume it fits it's role properly. Hoping the next two in the series have some more drama and plot twists. Nevertheless, the characters are still awesome and have a deep and powerful romance.
B000021XS0|5|I don't understand how anyone could give a masterpiece like this less than five stars.  As a musician, I am, of course, forced to bow in reverence when I hear Petrucci solo, but as an avid music fan I also find the music at times exciting, saddening, and completely absorbing. It seems absolutely ridiculous to slight this album for perceived faults such as overlong solos or technical showboating; with music this startlingly original and entertaining, why cut it short?
B006ZN7KMM|5|Una buena colección de artículos!

B00AESN8XY|5|I like this game. Well worth your money. If you don't like games involving the somewhat graphically described(ish)attempted eradication of the human race, you wont like this. But if you enjoy intense strategic gameplay and frantically switching menus and deciding what to use your DNA points on, you will probably enjoy this game. Yes, I just said that.

B00ADQPA38|5|This was a gift for my sons who absolutely love it! Can't wait for the current season to come out.!
B0084AXZK0|4|This is an extremely well written book, from a time when people still had good vocabularies. Unfortunately, the theological and philosophical fencing made parts of it difficult to read. The character that corrupted Dorian was cynical and almost amoral. It is only at the end that he reveals that he still hasn't answered that most basic question of death. If he just didn't think so highly of his own intelligence, he would be able to accept the truths he hears but just dismissed out of hand at the end of the book.

B000NGV9EW|5|Alexander McCall Smith's \\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\" is an entrancing work of fiction. Smith's lively prose and witty humour is set in a rich backdrop of exotic Gaborone and the Kalahari, replete with witchcraft and crocodiles, missing daughters and philandering husbands all flowing to the rhythms of Botswanan life. But the most endearing is the character of generously proportioned Precious Ramotswe, of traditional build as she puts it. Mma Ramotswe is human in her uncertainties and self-doubts and has a background and skills quite unlike any other fictional detective. She isn't Miss Marple, but her canny intuition, warmth and unreserved wit has created a character which already has contributed more to tourism in Botswana than the tourism promotion efforts of the local government.<br /><br />When her father dies, Precious Ramotswe sells the hundred and eighty cattle she inherits and sets up as Botswana's only female private detective. The beginning is tough but as she solves her cases in her own unique manner, her reputation spreads and cases start coming in. There's no single big mystery that runs throughout the book, but rather a variety of small cases: a wayward teenager daughter, a missing husband, a strangely behaving doctor and a kidnapped boy. The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is the first of eight books about Mma Ramotswe.<br /><br />Greatly recommended reading for its heart-warming quality and natural wisdom.

B003L20ID8|4|There's a scene in \\"Citizen Kane\\" where one of the characters mentions seeing a beautiful girl on a trolley and he regrets not sitting next to her, and not one day goes by where he doesn't think of that girl. We all have experiences and memories like that, we wonder what our lives would have been like if we did sit next to that girl, or if we did talk to her, or get her number (undoubtedly, we lay more importance on these experiences than they may deserve. They're giant `what if' moments in our lives, the path not taken). But what if that moment of decision is the intrusion of destiny or fate? And we we're supposed to be with that person? That is the theme of \\"The Adjustment Bureau.\\"<br /><br />David Norris (Matt Damon) is a fast rising Congressman with a great political future.  As he is set to win his race for the Senate, a revelation comes out that puts his whole political future in question. He goes into a men's room to rehearse his concession speech and meets Elise (Emily Blunt) and they feel that instant attraction of `knowing' they should be together. But circumstances pull them apart, or do they? The next day David catches an adjustment team, headed by Richardson (John Slattery) looking like he kept the wardrobe from \\"Mad Men.\\" The only reason Norris witnesses this is because the adjuster assigned to him, Harry Mitchell (Anthony Mackie), was literally asleep on the job. Richardson convinces David that it's for the best that he forget he ever saw them and that he should forget ever meeting Elise or else his destiny won't be fulfilled. Of course David can't stop thinking of Elise and sets out to find her, and the right to choose the course of his life.<br /><br />\\"The Adjustment Bureau\\" is based on a Philip K. Dick short story.  For the past thirty years or so Hollywood has been availing themselves of the topsy-turvy worlds Dick created. Some of the more successful of those being \\"Blade Runner,\\" \\"Total Recall,\\" and \\"A Scanner Darkly.\\" Where does \\"The Adjustment Bureau\\" fit in? Right in the middle with \\"Paycheck\\" Ben Affleck's Philip K. Dick based movie. Philip K. Dick's novels and short stories can really turn your head around. Dick turned reality on its head in his stories and usually turned that reality in on itself too. \\"The Adjustment Bureau\\" takes on the challenge of free will versus fate, and while it plays with it a bit it doesn't turn your head around, and leaves it a pretty simple discussion.<br /><br />The acting in \\"The Adjustment Bureau\\" is fine. There are no emotional pyrotechnics or great ranges explored but the characters are believable, and the chemistry between Damon and Blunt is palpable. When they kiss at their first meeting you feel the intimacy and impulsiveness of the moment.<br /><br />\\"The Adjustment Bureau\\" is a nice light movie to provoke a little post movie discussion or a nice adventure and peek behind reality's curtain.

6304696558|5|I loved this movie the first time....years ago.  I still love the message.  Even though we live in a different decade from when this was made, girls still are pushed into the man-pleaser role regardless of the media claims to the contrary.  Case in point:  look at the clothing styles promoted for our girls:  there was a time that current fashions would have been  a sign of a girl who was &#34;easy&#34;, or tacky, or what is now called a &#34;ho&#34;.  It's always refreshing to see the transformation of a girl when she realizes she is being diminished and takes control of her life. If you are a woman, you will identify in so many of the manipulations. The wedding scene in this movie is a great climax.  I wonder how a man would like this; I doubt he'd consider it seriously meaningful, which it is!

B001U3ZMHW|4|My 6 year old loves the Ewoks and with his birthday coming up we splashed out on this set.  To me this is a $100 set, not $150, but there is typical Lego quality and some nice Ewoks (3) in the set as well as the glider.  It would be nice to get an &#34;Ewoks village&#34; set (anyone from Lego reading?) but this is a nice rendition of the story to destroy the Death Star shields.  We thought a long time before buying this and if you can find it for $100 go for it but there is better value for money out there in the world of Lego to spend $150 on.  Of course our son thought it was worth it.
0920668372|5|Love this book!!!!
B00CCEHX5W|1|Deafheaven's Sunbather is one of those albums I was reluctant to check out simply because of the aesthetic of the cover art as it seems to skip over the standard ideological motifs pictured on most black metal album covers; however, after hearing all of the great reviews about this album I was compelled to check it out. It turns out my skepticism wasn't unfounded as I quickly discovered that this album lacks all of those great qualities so often ascribed to it. The music, far from &#34;revolutionary&#34; or &#34;groundbreaking,&#34; falls victim to monotonous drudgery. I get it. It's atmospheric black metal. It's going to be repetitive. Rather than use repetition as a musical device to tell a story or build on the song structure, Sunbather's repetitiveness is more like licking cardboard for hours as corporeal punishment. However, it is not all monotony! For as you lick the cardboard you are gifted the rare treat of an experimental riff chalked in late as an interlude. To a fan of black metal, this album is a vapid exploration of the degenerate state of USBM.  It lacks creativity,  is repetitive, is repetitive, and is trendy. Yes, there are plenty of USBM bands that you can apply these term to. I mean listen to Krieg's newest release. But, at least that authentic! I can't say that about Sunbather. Black metal isn't for everyone, and that's okay! But to insist upon projecting this album as a revolutionary USBM album does a disservice to band and to the genre as a whole. Yet, I would be wrong to pigeonhole this album as a black metal  one. This album in truth is a crossover album which combines all of the worst qualities of atmospheric black metal with a post-rock sensibility, and some &#34;shoegazer&#34; (whatever that means). As a crossover album it gains instant recognition among hipsters, and neckbeards the world around, for the appeal is understandable - it sets u[ an ironic juxtaposition of  the Dionysian rage of a depraved society, while possessing musical sensibility and tenderness, all packed in an album sleeve designed by MGMT. Pick it up on your next trip to urban outfitters.
B00CWVFZ8W|3|The ending was disappointing.

B005COO1X6|2|This story seemed a little too short to me.  The pieces of the story did not flow evenly or fit well together.  The \\"bad\\" main character was not very scary or believable.  The story ends quickly with an introduction into an advertisement for his new book.  This makes me think that Mile 81 is just a primer for his new book, 11/22/63.
B003ZK58WM|1|Ken Follet continues to trade on his name when he has long ago ceased to have anything interesting to say. Don't waste your time and money on this overpriced waste of paper.  Hell, at the ridiculous E-Book price, it's a waste of electrons too.  Get with he program publishers - E-Books are a whole new market where you could be making MORE money (yeah, a lower per unit profit - but greater volume) if you revised your pricing strategies.
B004GHNIRK|5|I haven't read this in years, so it's like reading it for the first time.  What a magnificent story!!  Victor Hugo was inspired when he wrote this, and the translator let him tell it without getting in the way.  Beautiful usage of the language!  Talk about plot development!!  He'll go back decades into history you can't quite understand how it relates to the story just to give us an insight into one character's character.  I'm about 1/3 of the way through it, but I'm finding it hard to put it down, it's so engrossing!!

0375414053|3|I Don't Know How She Does It's strengths include some lovely, witty one-liners and great insights into the frazzled and still lonely world of striving businesswomen. But some things about the books seemed so very '80s, making me wonder what this book had that was new and fresh. The only thing I could conclude is that women in London are 20 years behind the U.S. and that current readers have missed out on the last 25 years of feminist fiction. Pearson's story opens with the main character \\"distressing\\" a mince pie prior to the school carol concert--an image that current and former working moms can certainly relate to and understand. Unfortunately, the author went on to describe, in great detail, why she harbored such guilt, her own psychological underpinnings, and a plethora of details about the actual \\"distressing\\" technique. All of which served to undermine everything invoked in the first paragraph. This is my main complaint: too much back story, too much explaining. These faults are so endemic to first novels that maybe they aren't even considered a problem for readers. But I found Pearson's overly adipose prose slowed the book--and with a target market of harried, sleep-deprived, time-challenged readers (such as the main character), that seemed a serious mistake. They need a faster read.

0316017922|5|Typical of Malcolm Gladwell to, like looking through a kaleidoscope, give you a totally different view of a subject that had become seemingly all too familiar. The secrets of success had been attributed to success, vision, strategy and a number of other things. Not that he disputes these, but in giving a different view, he explores the environment in which successful people grow up; the events that influenced their time, opportunities they had to have had, the circumstances that presented themselves and the discipline or interest or passion they had to have had to take advantage of those circumstances.    This was an interesting book; the last of the Gladwell Trilogy. I'm sure this is not the last book coming out of this unusual mind. Definitely a good read.
B0062P3392|5|Fast service I'm a big Jason Statham fan. Great movie.
B003VPWX6K|4|I read this book after I saw the movie (years ago) with Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson. All through the book I could just hear them! I love both of them so maybe that's why I rated it highly. Stevens is the very embodiment of the perfect English butler, to the point that he denies self. He really functions as if he does not matter, all that matters is serving Lord Darlington and seeing that the house is run exactly right. That mindset worked well when Darlington Hall was in its heyday but is outmoded in later years. It seems as though everyone has moved on except Stevens. He laments the loss of the propriety that was expected of him and all the staff. He spends much time explaining what greatness is in regards to butlers and questions whether he was ever one of the truly great butlers, like those 2 or 3 men he so admired. All thought and energy is focused only on being the best. He struggles to join the present day but really doesn't understand how to do that. He really doesn't understand how to carry on &#34;light banter&#34; and doesn't get the new owner's humor. The tragedy in my opinion was that he totally missed the cues coming from Miss Kenton the housekeeper. She admired him and wished for a relationship beyond the parameters of their profession but he just didn't get it. She finally left to marry, giving Stevens an open door to say or do something to let her know he would like her to stay but he was so focused on being professional that he missed it. Finally, when the new owner suggests Stevens take a holiday, he starts thinking about things that were said and done at Darlington and comes to the realization that he perhaps didn't see some of the nefarious things Lord Darlington was up to. He also realizes that he may have a chance to rekindle the relationship with Miss Kenton,based on a letter she sent him, so he travels to her town to visit.

B00T3DNKIE|4|This book was more complicated and hard to follow than TKAM, but it was still good in its own right. The entire book is a fairly large build up to the last three chapters and reading the book from a 2015 standpoint, it's rather profound. Most of my highlights came in the last two chapters. It was good and I'm glad I read it.
B003EYVXTG|5|I really liked the movie, Excellent actress for charater   [[ASIN:B003EYVXTG Winter's Bone]] Great drama , really enjoyed the movie

067101756X|4|I suppose what most convinced me of Corso's truthfulness in this expos of the events which occurred at, and then followed from the 1947 crash of a mysterious flying ship, was his whole attitude toward the events throughout  the narration. Corso was not intent on convincing his audience of the  reality of aliens; he had lived with this knowledge for so long that for  him it was an unpleasant and inescapable fact. He concentrated instead on  telling us what the results of this alien presence were, how the  governments of the world thought and reacted to what they regarded as a  threat to our species, how new technologies grew from the refuse found at  the Roswell site, how different branches of the government jealously  guarded their secrets and developments from each other. A lot of emphasis  is also placed on the US government's fear that enemy nations had their own  UFO crashes and were extrapolating alien technologies faster than we were.  After reading this book, which names names without hesitation and finally  makes sense of our rapid rise in technology, Project Blue Book, and the  Roswell crash itself, I don't which I find more frightening...the  ubiquitous presence of these inhuman and unfriendly beings, or the reality  of governments which will go to any lengths to keep people from knowing the  truth.
B004DLPXAO|5|I have a kindle and I love it but since getting the app I don't have to carry on the train to work.. The app has everything you need to read all your books. For anyone taking train or bus to work and don't want to carry an extra device this is perfect

B004FGMDOQ|5|This tome, as in the 'Harry Potter' books is about the magic that is true friendship.<br /><br />Jacob has heard his grandfather's stories about his life in a strange and wonderful place. Soon Jacob started doubting the fantastical stories. It wasn't until his grandfather was murdered by a horrible creature that Jacob sets out to find the truth .<br /><br />A good book, not for young people.

B00B7FXZQS|3|It was Ok, Follows the same sort of script as all the others. Starts off boring to introduce characters, Some out of the ordinary stuff happens, someone reserches and finds out clues to what is haunting the family, then all of the action happens at the last minute.
B00I8H6X58|5|Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto give stunning performances in this movie. The subject matter is difficult if you remember the aids epidemic at all, but these two actors so immerse thereselves in the parts that you no longer remember them as the actors they are. You will remember the characters they portray long after the movie is over. Watch this movie.
B000HKYBXA|5|Wow, what a well-done rendition of Hamlet.  We thoroughly enjoyed watching it.  The main actor is very entertaining though it is spoken in Shakesperean English.

A discovery of a new intelligence on another planet, the pequeñinos, contacted by humans could lead to either a repeat of the last war result, or a new oportunity for a life reborn.<br /><br />A really nice study of how far can two cultures interact without affecting each ther, modyfing themselves, A contrast draw on how our ways of life could crash when others who are different act upon us and viceversa.<br /><br />The whole interaction of humans-ender-the pequeñinos, it's so interesting.<br /><br />Why not 5, the conflict around Novinha , her family, and ender, being to distractive to the central plot.

0385737955|5|Amazing book
B000007OY0|5|The Shawshank Redemption is by far, one of the greatest movies of all time.  It is ultimate story of how hope truly never dies, and how good things finally happen to good people.<br />Tim Robbins, in his finest acting  job to date, plays the wrongly convicted Andrew Dufresne.  He is sent to  Shawshank Prison for killing his wife and her lover, and there he meets  Red, played by the ever talented (and one of the best voice-over voices of  all time) Morgan Freeman.  The chemistry between the two is so amazing  throughout the entire movie, and you can clearly see it flow.<br />You really  begin to feel for Andy and his quiet demeanor peppered with subtle  emotions.  Just when you think the movie is going a certain way, the plot  takes an incredible turn that leaves you sitting there with your mouth  open.  From this point, just when you think the film is heading towards its  almost certain climax, it twists another way, leaving you sitting there,  not being able to control your giddy smile.<br />The film is wonderfully  written, and the actors were superb.  It has a beautiful flow to it, and  you can't help but enjoy the masterpiece that you are viewing.  You will  definately be pleasantly satisfied.  This film is an excellent addition to  anyone's video collection.
B00H9671DW|5|After watching this movies. I had to go and download some of the other great racing movies of all times, Grand Prix, LeMans and even Days of Thunder.
B0014Z4OQG|3|I managed to watch this movie only in bits and pieces, as i was having a hard time to focus because of the camera movement and was getting a headache and a bit nauseous.<br /><br />That fact aside, i thought the movie was a reasonably well made monster flick, although i am a bit old fashioned and looking at some of the special effects if they had done the traditional way of filming, it would have been cool.
B0000AQS0F|5|Firefly is an original, extremely fun, cliche-less combination of  western and space-faring. Is that possible? Yes, because the stories are very well written, with attention to detail and packed with good humor and plot twists, the actors are awesome and the general look (ship design, costumes, weapons, special effects, etc) is quite believable. <br /> <br />The pilot episode starts rather suddenly, without much explaining of the main characters, but as the show goes on one gradually finds out more about Serenity's crew. After the first DVD I was a complete Firefly addict. However, after watching it all, I feel many promises were unfulfilled [chinese muttering]. <br /> <br />I can't believe anyone in his right mind would cancel such a wonderful series just when things started to get more interesting. The upcoming Serenity movie is good news though, and I'll be sure to bring all my friends to see it.
B00I8H7APK|4|Great Movie........but NOT as GREAT as LOVE ACTUALLY!!  However overall  it was a really great feel good romantic movie for everyone.

B005GFPZYK|1|It is probably  not a popular  thing to do, but  I  did not care for the narrative .  I know  he risked his life and that was his choice  to go to the conflict. He came across as a killer  that found more satisfaction  killing  than taking care of his wife and kids
B007FH9GT2|5|Gripping narrative

B0001611DI|4|I remember buying this at non chain grocery store back in 2006, it was all wrapped. Everytime I tried watching on my Playstation 2 it would always skip an hour in. But on other DVD players it worked fine.    I guess it was probably one of those rare times where it is a bad disc.     Anyways, you should totally get this DVD, if you don't like huge box sets then this one is perfect for you.

B00AQ3K8IU|4|I love following the mystery and putting the pieces together of the story. Although it became a little too intense for my liking.

B0009WFFS6|5|Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker re-unite to play all their songs from 35 years ago when they formed a trio called \\"Cream.\\" Those were the psychedelic days of England and America and these guys looked it: all skinny, very long hair, wild clothes and loud music. They played a combination of rock and blues and it was, for the most part, good stuff.    Well, these guys are now 60-something years old and they can still sing and play at a high level as this wonderful DVD concert disc shows us. I was always extremely familiar with Clapton, of course, who has never been out of the limelight, but I didn't know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, neither of whom I hadn't seen in decades. They surprised me. When he was young, Baker was so gaunt he looked like a speed freak near death. Now he looks healthy, in shape and his drum playing was solid. Bruce looked a bit haggard but his voice is great, as good as ever and a pleasure to hear on these old songs. This is just excellent material and performing from guys who know what they're doing.    Some people criticized this show for being low-key. I don't agree with that. I have no complaints. The concert sounded very good. The second song, \\"Spoonful,\\" was outstanding, the highlight of the concert for me.    Highly recommended.

B003XVYLDU|5|It was great
B000FCKC4C|1|I found the book dull, repetitive, and uninspiring. I would not recommend it to anyone. I don't understand all the hoopla about this book.
B00068NVI4|1|As several reviewers have astutely noted, the sound is emasculated, the performances tame and Jon Anderson is so much up front and more annoying than usual.  I agree with his sentiments, but his smug goody-two-shoes guru of PEACE! LOVE! HAPPINESS! demeanor is purely peurile.  It's excusable when not excessive and the band is crankin' -- but here it seems Messrs. Wakeman, Howe, Squire & White are mainly window dressing for the highly enlightened, inspiring, mercurial Jon Anderson.  I've seen Yes at least a half dozen times from '75 on.  This represents the band at a nadir; perhaps they're just too old and creaky to blast off like they used to.
B005HEFB6M|4|Great series, I enjoy it quite a lot. It did not come up to expectations of some fans but still great entertainment.

B005LAIHZY|4|A warm, cozy fairy tale that feels more like a Disney production than the latest entry in Pixar's storybook. It's sweet, quirky and funny, but routinely falls back on familiar motifs and often seems criminally under-explored. Since the vast majority of the action takes place in and around a single locale, there's a claustrophobic quality in the air that never truly dissipates, which robs us of the grand scale that's been present in every one of the animation factory's preceding works. It's no more than a straightforward telling of a reasonably interesting fable, with only a few short jolts of the unique character and timely laughs I've come to expect from the troupe. Of course, there's no arguing the fact that Pixar knows how to produce gorgeous scenery, and Brave is yet another leap forward in that regard; the surrounding landscapes are unanimously breathtaking, and Princess Merida's hair is constantly bouncy and lifelike, truly a character unto itself. It's an enjoyable fresh ride and a marked improvement over the lifeless Cars 2, but misses the depth and flair that made me fall so deeply in love with the studio's classics.
B00000099Y|5|The thing they do better than any other band is allow both the lyrics AND the music tell the story.  It's very powerful and very deep and you need above a \\"stoner IQ\\" to truely appreciate it. <br /> <br />You won't find any teen angst songs about hating your mom and your dad or any songs on how you're sorry for treating your girlfriend wrong.  If that's your thing, go listen to good charlotte or blink 182 or one of the other bands that put out sugar coated simplistic lyrics these days.
B007STBUHI|5|Great movie
B0001AVZA8|5|The two of these actors together fits really well!  I guess it is just too much fun watching people discover themselves all over again during their questionable mid life crisis!

B008A1B5Z0|5|Spoiled by Amazon's update policy.  I went ahead and purchased from Google so I could get updates necessary for this to work properly on my Note PRO 12.2.  Yes, I know Android doesn't -need- a RAM Booster, but there are times, especially on this tablet where I have multiple programs open in windows that things DO get sluggish.  I press \\"Boost\\" and this closes any program still running in the background.  I always see that Android does this automatically, but I like to have control of what is closed in the background and what is kept running.<br /><br />I'd also like to point this tidbit out:  Android includes a stock task manager.  If one wasn't needed, why is one built in?
B00AQ3K8IU|5|I think that Hopeless was a great book.  It's amazing how accurately Colleen Hoover can get into the head of a teenager.  This book left me breathless at times.  I found myself , gasping, fearful, feeling sad, but then laughing right out loud.  Any book that can evoke that many emotions is a great book.  You won't be disappointed.
B00BQI4AU6|4|Tom Keifer is the main singer, songwriter, and lead guitar player of the group Cinderella. Back in the day, they got grouped with the Hair Metal bands, although their music was somewhat bluesier with a lot of Stones type swagger. All of their studio albums are top notch, if you enjoy that sort of music. Keifer left the spotlight not so much as his popularity faded, but that he had severe throat problems, and was pretty much unable to perform for a decade and a half. Now, with the health problems behind him, he returns with a rocking, yet slightly more mature version of his style of music. This cd is as good as anything he has ever done, which is very good indeed.<br /><br />I recommend this to fans of blues rock, like the Rolling Stones, the Faces, or AC/DC.
B004W4N55C|1|After I was updated to lollipop I lost important features such as saving my favorites and changing the font so tabs line up.  I contacted UG and they said they don't support the Amazon app anymore.  So much for paying $8.  Thanks a bunch UG.

B00E8KLWB4|4|I like it!
0393312836|3|Although I agree that this work is certainly deserving of the term \\"enduring\\", having read the re-published \\"British\\" edition I feel that it falls short of deserving the categorization of \\"masterpiece\\". In the introduction, Burgess himself claims that he is unhappy with the fact that Clockwork is his best-known work and insists that the original \\"American\\" and Kubrick movie versions were incomplete. Those versions end with the 20th chapter, instead of the 21st that the British and most other editions were published with. To not risk giving out spoilers, I will simply say that personally, I disagree with Burgess and feel that the book would have been more of a masterpiece if all versions ended with the 20th chapter.<br /><br />The dialect that the narrator uses is at first hard to understand. Thankfully, I quickly got used to it, but the first few chapters were rough and I honestly think the book would have been just as good if Burgess had used proper English and not the made-up slang he actually used. Also, it was admittedly a bit difficult to read through the extreme amount of violence written into the story, although of course the novel would not have had the same impact without that. In the end, although I think this book raises interesting questions and was a great story, because of the aforementioned things I simply can't rate it at more than 3 out of 5 stars.
030758836X|2|Wasn't my kind of book. I felt it was pretty lame and sort of when on and on and on without much happening.

B004APVI1G|2|Not recommended, probably not suitable as a kid stopper. Nice pictures, terribly lame plot,story,whatever. Sorry we wasted the money. We were not entertained.
0307959473|4|I am a little skeptical about publishing the book at the time it became available on the market.  However,<br />it is the personal reflections of it's author, which makes it original and authentic to his perspctive of his experienced.  It is well written and fast reading.

B000002A3T|4|After being disappointed for several albums, this is the first one since 'The Wall' worth buying. the music is inspiring but with the exception of a few tracks is just an ordinary Pink Floyd album. I do Recommend this one,  but as one of many.
B00DR0PDNE|5|love it so much we bought two for our bedroom and livingroom.

B007SGM084|5|Loved it can't wait for the movie to come out.very good book. A long book but very good. A must to read
0671045857|5|While I enjoyed the story, and Stephen King is always wonderful, I really must comment on Anne Heche's reading/performance. She is mezmerizing! I listened to this book in my car commuting to work, but found taking the long way, wanting to hear more. Anne Heche sends chills down your spine as she speaks the words in Tricia's subconscious. I highly recommned listening to this book.
B000WS4PCO|5|Seriously, having had this album in my collection since I was 13 years old, I should have reviewed it a very long time ago, as with a number of other albums I have owned for equally as long in my now gigantic collection of well over 900 CDs. In fact, a number of the songs on this album go back even further in my life, I believe all the way back to when I was 4 or 5 years old, and my mom would play this album for me and my younger brother. Well to this day do I remember how my brother and I both loved it so much even at such an early age. After all, it was released in 1987, the year after I was born!  I was also just as blessed when my dad took me to see them live when I was 14. What an experience that was!<br /><br />Anyways, that is enough about my life story. Let us review the album!<br /><br />As with a number of my other reviews, there is not really much I can say that has not already been said about this timeless album already. I will definitely say that it is a milestone in the sense of taking the expression of political concerns to another level in the sense of expressing such views with a higher-than-ever-before level of eloquence, and into musical territory far more complex and technical than the classic punk rock of the late 1970s. Some may agree and some may disagree with this outlook, but this is the way I have always seen it with this album.<br /><br />In all honesty, I have never really been all that big on analyzing individual songs, but I do feel it to be somewhat necessary in the case of a select few:<br /><br />In the case of “Where The Streets Have No Name,” I cannot help but point out how it is the perfect song to send the kick-off start to the album as a whole. With the way that it starts off nice, slow and easy with the distant organ that steadily “looms and approaches,” it gives the listener the sense that they are in for an adventure of pure, epic, musical entrancement, not just with this song, but with the album as a whole. As The Edge comes in with his galloping guitar, followed by the rest of the band along with Bono’s attention-grabbing voice, you just do not want to stop listening, hands down.<br /><br />Another worthy mention is the sheer intensity and pulsating emotion of “Bullet The Blue Sky.” It almost sounds as if Bono is about to go crazy on someone at any moment with the way he seems to be breathing very heavily as he sings. For this reason, this song is a pristine example of how volume and intensity are two different variables. As a die-hard metalhead, I can accurately say that I can get the same amount of pulsating adrenaline from this song as I can get from any Black Sabbath or Iron Maiden song.<br /><br />“Mothers Of The Disappeared,” on the other hand, offers a more saddening atmosphere to the listener, which might not sound appealing to most common people, but addresses a tragic situation that simply cannot be left ignored. It is a criticism of U.S. foreign policy under the Reagan Administration that not everyone may agree upon, but I will not go any further with that thought. Despite the fact that this song might not be very upbeat, it consists of pure emotion and pulsating feeling, as can be shown in Bono’s voice.<br /><br />In any sense of the word, every song on this album, be it the uplifting feel of “With Or Without You” or “Red Hill Mining Town,” or the pulsating intensity of “Bullet The Blue Sky” or the dark balladic sadness of “Running To Stand Still” or “Mothers Of The Disappeared,” is a showcase of the superior depth and musicianship of U2 in their ultimate prime. This album, alongside many others, is a work of art that was meant to stand the test of time. Calling it a masterpiece is simply an understatement, and anyone who does not think so must not have any ears. U2 have proven themselves to be the type of band that makes music to make music, and to never be afraid to say what they want to say about anything, be it positive or negative. They have touched the hearts of millions the world over, and will always be light years ahead of all the worthless pop/rap/EDM trash that pollutes the airwaves nowadays. I should not even have to say that, as anyone with even a smidgen of a brain cell knows that is just common sense.<br /><br />Anyways, if you consider yourself a true fan of great music that actually means something not only to music history, but to society in general, then it makes no sense for you not to own this album. Just buy it already! You will be very glad you did.ve.

B00005A46T|3|Every generation gets the heavy metal heroes it deserves. <br /> The hedonistic '70s produced Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith. The superficial '80s gave us Moetley Cruee and Poison. And now, the violent, dysfunctional days of this new millennium have given us the frightening Slipknot, the new Antichrist superstars of disaffected teens everywhere. <br /> We should not be surprised by their popularity. Everything about this nine-member troupe from Des Moines is tailor-made to appeal to surly adolescents. Start with the look, which is, after all, just as important to kids as the music: The members perform in identical industrial coveralls. They wear freaky-creepy horror-movie masks. They go by single-digit numbers instead of names. Think about it: Anonymity, withdrawal from conventional society, the creation of a fearful new persona, a sense of belonging to a rebellious and powerful group -- what more could your average teen want except a side of fries? <br /> In Slipknot's case, that would be the music -- a monstrously heavy and explosively destructive cacophony of pain and mayhem more akin to the blackest European death metal than the comparatively benign rap-rock of Limp Bizkit. Searing sheets of guitars, pummeling waves of maniacally frenzied rhythm, nuclear-powered bass guitars and tortured vocals that veer from a guttural growl to a white-hot primal scream are the main ingredients in this recipe. And it's all served up with a bottomless lyrical cup of bitter psychotic rage. The message is simple: Slipknot hate everything about society. And everybody in it. Us, themselves, you -- especially you. <br /> Amazingly enough, they're even more pissed off on their second major-label album Iowa than they were on their eponymous 1999 debut. That album was like a middle finger stuck in the face of the world; this one is more like a fist heading towards your skull. On shiny, happy tunes with titles like People = S--, My Plague, I am Hated and New Abortion, Slipknot make their intentions graphically clear: They don't just want you to clear off. They want to stab you, bathe themselves in your blood and have sex with your corpse. We are not hyperbolizing. \\"I wanna slit your throat and f-- the wound / I wanna push my face in and feel the swoon,\\" bellows vocalist No. 8 on the devastating Disasterpiece, one of the 14 violence-drenched assaults in this hour-long session of brutality. And you thought Marilyn Manson was evil? <br /> Slipknot may not be evil but they're damned clever. The warning sticker on this CD (at least on the review copy we got) is stuck to the outer plastic wrapper, so kids who buy it can remove it before they get home. As much as we hate those stickers and the censorship they represent, that sneaky tactic concerns us. Slipknot's Iowa is an album every responsible parent should hear, both by themselves and with their kids. Not to try to dissuade teens from listening to Slipknot -- frankly, these songs are so relentlessly over the top and indistinguishably one-dimensional that even kids should get bored of them pretty quick. But adults might want to point out to the young 'uns that Slipknot is selling rebellion the same way McDonald's sells those fries. And that while their horrifically violent reactions to life and its evils make for excellent cathartic fantasies -- and we all have them -- they aren't to be confused with reality. <br /> Otherwise, we suspect it's only a matter of time until another confused, neglected kid listens to a disc like this, picks up a weapon and screws up a whole bunch of lives. And if we as a society just let that happen, it will be just what we deserve.
B007SGLZP8|4|Another great effort by Grisham. I've enjoyed another of his gripping, exciting, believable stories that surely gets and holds<br />your attention.
B005651R24|3|John Green is a great and amazing writing author with a great collaboration, however not as amazing as some of his other exquisite books.
B00992CF6W|5|It is a good game
031625178X|4|Well written but I just personally don't agree with some of his conclusions,  A tiny percentage of successes with an affliction does not make them advantages for the other 99 per cent who have them.
B00DPM7TIG|5|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The narrative follows two teenagers during World War II, blind Marie-Laure of Paris, France and Werner Pfennig of Germany. Both characters overcome obstacles and deal with their own limitations (Marie's physical, Werner's one of character) where time and the machinery of war eventually lead them to meet.<br /><br />The chapters dealing with Werner's schooling at an elite political school and the brutal treatment of the instructors were exceptionally well written and devastating at the same time.<br /><br />I held out hope for the ultimate happy ending but was not disappointed when it did not happen.<br /><br />The chapters are incredibly short, giving this book a fast reading feel despite the 500+ page length. Intricately woven, the short chapters bounce through time and location but surprisingly it was not difficult to follow and was well laid out developing the characters even as we knew how their worlds would ultimately collide.<br /><br />I don't want to give away too much of the plot but both the main two characters and the minor characters are so well written and developed that it's an astounding feat. I can't wait to read more from this author.
B00020HEL6|5|Stellar--simply stellar!  This young woman's style and voice are incomparable.  Gotta have this CD NOW!!!  One listen and you'll agree, to be sure.
B000021Y7X|5|What can I say after watching this video?  OMG.  This is what the 80's were all about.  David Byrne's opening number just starts the onslaught of what is to come to you visually as well as vocally.  Mr. Demme is indeed brilliant at directing this very entertaining DVD of the Heads.  I can laugh about their outfits now, but they were cool in the 80's I remember.  I bought this video after reminiscing about the Heads, and recalled watching it back in the 80's when it was VHS. I just had to have this DVD as part of my collection. Reliving my youth I guess you could call it.      It is an outstanding portrait of what the Talking Heads were all about.  I still hear these same songs on my classic rock stations here in Pa.  Just watch the manic pace of the Heads under the mastery of David Byrne's vocals and actions.  I urge you to get this DVD if you are a Heads fan. The Big Suit is worth the price.  The songs are great and they are played by a very talented group of individuals. You will not be sorry.
B003M6EAXM|5|I cannot get enough of 24!  Having to watch the new season live is killing me so I came back and watched the last two seasons on Amazon.  Now I will probably start again at season 1!
B00004XQ83|5|Its easy to see why it won so many awards!  If you are being introduced to bluegrass / gospel / \\"old-timey\\" music, this is perfect.  Ralph Stanley, Alison Krauss & Union Station, Gillian Welch, Emilou Harris, John Hartman, all in one place. <br /> <br />Anyone who is a fan of county or bluegrass simply MUST own this album.
B0074QGGK6|4|Objective, simple, and very profound points of view! Must read. Simple but useful ilustrations. Consider it as an artist to-do list :)
B005ZOBNOI|5|great read, can't wait to see the movie
B00915G6YE|5|It is hard to write a review of a product like this with out giving away the plot. So all that I will say is this season kept be glued to the TV until it was finished. It left me wanting more. It is a great show with amazing acting and you will find yourself rooting for Dexter all the way through.
B00I6IKSZ0|4|I try loading it up but it stops at 91% and doesn't move I got the game two days ago and can't even play it. I turned my tablet off and uninstalled then reinstalled. RiliSoft better have an update to fix this. I do recommend the game though, very addictive. Just a warning if it doesn't load and stops at 91% you are screwed.
141659521X|5|I love these Mitch Rapp novels. Only problem is, I get it, read it in 2 days, then I wait for the next. The Last Man has a few surprises that really keep the action moving. I hope one of these Vince Flynn novels makes it to the big screen.
B00FKF0F3C|1|The third book in a trilogy that started out great, got worse and ended horribly!  Ken Follett's written some fantastic historical novels in the past, (&#34;Pillars&#34;, &#34;World&#34;) but this book stinks of an obvious bias toward left-wing propaganda and revisionist history!  It mirrors the unsophisticated &#34;rubbish&#34; spewed by the &#34;professors&#34; at your typical California state Jr. College.  Its falsehoods and interpretations of American history remind me a freshman midterm paper.  Total trash!  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!  Follett needs to stick with European history, because he knows nothing about America other than his total regurgitation of the network media's narrow ideology!
B004H4XDBI|4|Very quick read, wish the story would have been longer though.
B001EYU1VO|1|Bought less than 6 months ago, already broken. Buttons no longer work, and it switches to \\"up\\" view when firing guns. Complete waste of money, I'll never buy anything from this pile of crap company again.
B00BVYNSLC|3|Intetesting take on an old but rarely explored concept: Clones. Beautiful and sexy young talent. Nice intrigue. Good show all around.
B00BVYNSLC|5|The conflicts intertwine throughout the episodes creating closeness with the characters and plot.
B002MQYOFW|5|Love the book and it's a easy read especially since I'm not a huge reader. Would definitely recommend the book!
B00BBW16HW|4|While I'm sure this was probably &#34;schmaltzed&#34; up  a bit by Hollywood, it's hard not to like this film. Omar Sy was terrific.
B00B2V66VS|3|Ok so these running games can be tedious once you 've done them for awhile. The 2nd version of this game is cool from its treasure hunt to the rapids run it keeps you pushing you to the next level
B00127RAJY|5|I've been doing this workout On Demand for two weeks now.  I am overweight and still on level 1, but I feel great!  I decided to make a whole lifestyle change and try eating healthier, too.  With the video and the diet, I've already lost 8 lbs.  Just stick with it and focus on why you are working so hard.  You will make it through the pain of the first week.  Each day it gets easier, I promise.  I would definitely recommend this video for anyone trying to lose 50lbs or less.
B006CQLGXG|5|This book is a fantastic read and the illustrations add another dimension to an already lovely book. Buy it and read it.
B004SUWR2C|3|This can be fun, took me a while to figure out how to get out of the game, but finally figure it out.  I like Uno, so I guess I would have to say I would recommend this.
B00A3NQNUU|1|Downloaded this supposedly &#34;free&#34; kids' game for my 8 year old nephew who was visiting.  The free game wound up costing me $114.00 in downloads that the child was enticed to order as he played, until I noticed the activity and shut off the credit card on my Amazon account.  Thankfully, Amazon was willing to refund all of it.  BEWARE of your settings if you order this game!
B00B8M4IMK|5|This adaptor charges fast.  Works great. We are a multi-device family and it is always in use when we are in the car.
B003Q6D2BE|5|I love this purchase and I would recommend it to any one to purchase this item for their fun and excitement!
B0000AI44Q|5|An amazing recording and a good story with an environmental (WAKE UP CALL)message.  A raw sound (as if you are sitting in the studio)that fits this recording perfectly.  Possibly the Horse's best!  My only question...why is there no Poncho?  Do not hesitate to purchase this.
B008IJT0CE|5|This App has a fantastically large amount of sounds as well as presets that make it easy to use!<br /><br />My girlfriend and I use this to fall asleep or to relax. From listening to rain and thunder to the soft sound of an urban city at night in my case. This app also comes with certain wavelengths of sound to help you achieve certain kinds of rest or to help calm your mind down.<br /><br />An amazing addition to my app library as well as an awesome way for me to fight the stress of day to day life!
B008EEZ64Y|5|Lois Lowry's well worn little book is an important read for young readers and their parents. I came to it at 60, and I'm glad I did.

B005PR44XC|4|This was an engaging but not enthralling view of the recent economic crisis. It gives an interesting insight into the psyche of the affected nations.
B00BJ64FU0|5|Sherlock Holmes is always good reading plus cheap on Amazon. It's a good book to have on your device because you can read the stories at different times and always go back to it.The books and chapters are all annotated for easy location. Whenever I start a new book in a series like this I bookmark the first page. This lets me know which ones I've read when I start jumping around the table of contents.
B0073COMUW|1|The bulb works fine for out of the way spots like closets or garages, but the &quot;daylight&quot; color temp is reminiscent of industrial fluorescent tubes rather than the usual residential bulbs. Several members of my family had an intensely negative reaction to the sharp white light, which is unusual to say the least.  It is especially noticeable if there are other lights bulbs in the immediate area.  There are other bulbs on the market that have the warmer yellow tone that people are used to.
B0063IH60K|4|it was a really fun time consumer which helps when I am so very bored. Hope you will like it too!!!! :)
B007MDB71O|4|My review title is to correct those whom, like me, feared this to be a dull story about a civil war guy (seriously?) who ends up on the barren deserts of Mars. Not so - it's a fantastic sci-fi blockbuster. The story's complexity is near that of Dune, which works to its benefit. The hero character is similar to The Outlaw Josey Wales, but not as dark. The special effects are throughout and are excellent; Star Wars-like even, perhaps to a fault in that one machine has a distinct Return of the Jedi flying speeder sound to it. So many interesting locales that the action takes place in, I don't know why the original trailer looks boring in comparison to the actual movie. The title likewise is uninspiring. &#34;Princess of Mars&#34; might have been equally applicable and would have both honored Edgar Rice Burroughs as well as the story. So sorry I missed it at the big screen, but sure happy the great looking Blu-ray is now mine.
B000MRAAJM|5|Every parent needs to get this and spend some quality time with the kidlets learning about our global home. In truth, this is gripping for all ages but no child should miss it. On that note, I'd also highly recommend the new Cosmos TV series that is airing now.
B003YL4LYI|4|I love ASOIAF, it is so complex and exciting. ADWD  rates a little lower than the others mainly because I felt frustrated at the slower pace compared to the others. It seemed like it was all building up to something and ended before there was any satisfying conclusion. I am going to re read the series and combine ADWD and AFWC using chapter guides that have been put together to to follow the timeline more closely. Who knows, it may end up being my favorite after a while.
0140367586|5|This book picks up where the first Pollyanna left off. She returns home her legs are healed, but her Aunt and new Uncle are going Europe.

0385339585|5|I have been pro and con with my reviews and opinions on previous Grisham novels I have read (7 in all). Even when I'm disappointed I still go back because I believe he is a smart and talented writer. I don't have enough words of praise for \\"The Testament\\". I am overwhelmingly shocked to find this was not made into a movie, it certainly read like one. It kind of reminded me of the Hepburn/Bogart classic \\"The African Queen\\", with all the class and richness. Highly recommend \\"The Testament\\"!!
B00BETX5PS|4|Good movie
B00M25DDQE|4|love this
B00HZ48QUA|4|This isn't a movie that you're going to be telling all your friends that they have to watch, but it's definitely an enjoyable film.  It's got an amazing cast and they really worked well together.  The script is simplistic and predictable, but as always with just the boys in Vegas, there are some great moments that will leave you in stitches.
B000002G8J|4|Great kinda mellow rock album.  One of my favorite 70's recordings and I like it more and more as my tastes mellow and a bit of a country rock twang sounds good to me.  May have to buy it on CD one day -- Lord knows how long the vinyl will hold up.
B003F3FJQO|3|interesting book, unexpected plot twists, but overall a tad bland. worth reading if you like dystopian fiction. should be an interesting movie.
B008220C92|5|Director Scott Derrickson's latest entry into the horror genre, the aptly titled `Sinister', is an instant classic.<br /><br />Egomaniacal true-crime novelist, Ellison Oswalt, moves his wife and two kids into the house where an unsettling murder involving a family of five has recently taken place. He plans to write about the incident and the missing child, who was apparently spared and kidnapped by the killer, hoping that he can solve the mystery without the help of the local authorities.<br /><br />As he stores boxes in the attic, he finds several reels of Super 8 film and a projector. Each film contains increasingly graphic and macabre footage of a family being murdered. Upon further inspection, Ellison discovers that a pale, hollow-eyed figure can be seen lurking in the background in each one of the home movies. A pattern begins to emerge, as Ellison becomes consumed with the dark secrets that lie within the films. Further investigation confirms that there are demonic forces at work, and that Ellison may have opened a gateway that has placed his family in danger.<br /><br />`Sinister' takes familiar themes and situations and spins them in entirely different directions, making the film unpredictable and highly unnerving as a result. The film score by Christopher Young is almost a character in and of itself. It accentuates the disturbing nature of the film, cranking the scares all the way up to eleven. Ethan Hawke delivers an extraordinarily nuanced performance, and this ranks among some of his best work. The rest of the cast is just as good, under the direction of Scott Derrickson, who pulls absolutely no punches for the entirety of the film. Where most directors would turn away from such material, Derrickson dives right in, creating a cinematic experience that will live forever in your memory.<br /><br />`Sinister' is utterly disturbing and the best horror film that I have seen all year. Not for the squeamish, that's for damn sure.<br /><br />Rated R for terror and violence. 110 minutes. Directed by Scott Derrickson. Released by Summit Entertainment.
B00CLT31D6|5|You know the neighbor who drives the modest car, with modest house, simple (but nice) clothes you see everyday--did you EVER think he could have a seven-figure (millionaire) net worth?<br /><br />It's possible as myself (and my parents) are 'proof' as we did achieve this WITHOUT being 'lucky' NOR working until age 80.<br /><br />The 'secret': Spending MODESTLY and saving (investing) agressively.

B00GX50BD2|5|I liked it as far as it went.  Hope they will do a sequel  of his life from where this movie ended.
B000UJ48VI|4|Maybe I'm more favorably disposed toward this film because I have no loyalty at all toward the novel.  I had to put down the book, never to return, after the hotel scene in which Humbert screws his 12-year-old stepdaughter.  That may be a vulgar way of putting it, but one of things I disliked about the novel was how the ugly facts of pedophila and child molestation got embellished in long passages of thick purple prose, the suffocating inner workings of Humbert's sick mind, which may ultimately have been the writer's objective but I found the whole premise too repulsive to continue.    As noted in another review here, Kubrick takes us out of Humbert's mind and observes Humbert objectively in context with others.  And his Lolita is older than Nabokov's, looking more like 16, and acting like a wily and precocious femme fatale who makes fools of men of all ages.   And since the men act like fools, it's natural that this would become a comedy, albeit a dark one. I can appreciate reviewers who object to the inclusion of Peter Sellers' shtick because it tends to trivialize the tone of the film; the bit with Sellers as the cliched Austrian psychoanalyst was maybe too TV, though the juxtaposition of this Goon Show-like character and Mason's carefully mannered, uptight Humbert was truly funny, especially the expression on Mason's face--almost as though he was thinking, \\"Kubrick, what the hell is going on here??\\".  I think that Kubrick used Sellers to much better effect later in \\"Dr. Strangelove\\", which may have been the result of his experimenting with Sellers in \\"Lolita\\".     Anyway, on the whole the performances are good and there are great comedic moments.  There is a tragic feel toward the end of the film as we see Humbert's pathetic attempts to maintain and protect his idealized life with Lolita as it rapidly falls apart, and Mason delivers a standout performance of this.      So, see the film on its own terms, don't expect the novel, and enjoy.
B00KVI76ZS|5|Great book!

B00M7UTFW0|4|It was entertaining but didn't quite follow the Bible.
B0053TMP24|5|When I pre-ordered this book back in August, it said the text-to-speech would be enabled. It's not. Now it is listed that way, but what happened to the book I wanted... the one with text-to-speech. It's crazy that a book which features dyslexic heros does not support this feature! And it's even more crazy that it was advertised to have it and it doesn't. Combine that with the dozens of typo's and mis-spacings and you have a real mess on your hands!<br />I love this series, and have been counting the days for it to be released, but next time I hope they do a better job with the kindle version. It's only $1.00 less than the hardcopy, and the quality is VERY POOR.<br /><br />The story however was wonderful! Love Frank and Hazel. Looking forward to getting all 7 on that ship and moving forward. I wish there had been one more chapter at the end. I felt like the \\"cliff hanger\\" was too abrupt. Starting the count down till next fall when book 3 will be released!
B00LLMFAAG|5|Some of the best of 70's music.
B008Y7N7JW|4|I listened to this book through Audible before seeing the movie and felt the movie did a descent job holding to the book.  The story itself is unique and worth seeing, hearing or reading.
1861085257|4|I own Angie Scarr's first book too, and prefer the first one to the 2nd one. The 2nd one feels a little rushed, and feels like as much data was crammed in there as possible, so the step by step tutorials aren't as thorough. Overall, though if you already have experience with canning it's a great resource and inspiration. It might just be a little tough for beginners to follow along.
B0034G4OVS|4|not a bad movie.  Unusual premise, who'd ever think of making a movie of 3 people stuck on a ski lift 50 to 75ft in the air, on an empty slope.  if your afraid of heights this might move you to the edge of the couch.   I think the wolves were a bit much but you never know I guess.  definitly worth checking out.

I know I ill be Politically Incorrect; although, PC has nothing to do with my view of this feature. It was just slow and old - much like I'm growin' to be with all these films I have been renting off of Amazon.

0380789035|3|This is probably Gaiman's most popular novel, and I wish I could share the fans' enthusiasm. While American Gods is certainly both competent and entertaining, I have enough problems with it that I simply don't much care for it as a story. Gaiman's prose style isn't bad, though it is never great, and I would have liked something a little better for a story dealing with such high-minded ideas. But it is the ideas that are the problem, here. Gaiman has written about the survival of ancient, unworshipped gods before and since, especially in his Sandman series and in the later Anansi Boys. The big idea that he repeats in all these works is that gods are beings born out of the collective religious consciousness of a people, that they are phantasms which can exist only so long as they are worshipped, but who still possess what we would think of as godlike powers while they still live. This is hardly a dull idea, even if it is reheated Jungianism, and it's not hard to see why it found such a large audience. Unfortunately, I simply cannot take Gaiman's metaphysics seriously enough to enjoy the novel.<br /><br />Even so, Gaiman imbues his story with some fine, human moments, and he even occasionally recalls his earlier skills as a horror writer. There's a large section of the novel that takes place in an out-of-the-way town and which seems largely inconsequential to the story as a whole, despite a late attempt to tie it back into the main plot. The most entertaining part of the novel is that it makes you want to rummage through your Encyclopedia of Mythology to identify all the gods and demigods who appear.<br /><br />Not a bad read, but hard to take seriously, despite all its sound and fury. Might be worth reading as preparation for the upcoming HBO television adaptation.
B006LSZECO|2|Not once did I root for a character and I hated the ending. It might just be me and my selfish ways of wanting the ending to go a certain way but I was just not satisfied with the ending. I loved the plot but none of the characters appealed to me. I wanted to at least liked one character in the book. The twist was amazing, but I was left wanting more. The end was annoying because there was just no closure. I wanted more but was left with little. I definitely enjoyed the writing and reading it was enjoyable, but I was not compelled at all during the time I read it. I just read it at my own pace. I wouldn't recommend it to friends.
B000001FY7|5|All the songs are good and simple and cheery, they are very catchty and very skafull
B004L49K20|5|Duran Duran has returned for their first album since Red Carpet Massacre.  The Timbaland-produced album was a commercial and critical failure, and showed that while Duran Duran understood the kind of music that was popular at the time of the album's release, it simply did not fit Duran Duran as well as it should have.    Enter Mark Ronson and All You Need is Now.  This album has been declared as \\"Son of Rio,\\" and that's somewhat accurate.  Duran Duran is not simply retooling an old album here, however.  They are also making music that fits in with the time that most music fans are living in now:  We want to dance, and if we don't want to dance, we need to be gripped in another fashion.    From the title track opening the album to the somber conclusion in \\"Before the Rain,\\" we are given an album that is dripping with synth, harmonies and an attitude in the lyrics that boastfully revolves around women in the way that Duran Duran has done for decades--with lust, curiosity and ultimately, love for females that have gone in more ways than one.    This is possibly the defining Duran Duran album of the past few releases, it may go largely unnoticed in the bass-heavy, autotune-choked, unoriginal Billboard charts, but for true fans of Duran Duran and even those who are looking for music that recaptures the feel of the 80s and 90s and updates it for the new millennium, All You Need is Now is a welcome breath of fresh air.
