B006BZI6AY|5|Worked great, I was able to directly replace my motor in my Magnum with no problems.
B00TY78AAM|5|Hilarious pattern, but I like it. The backseat covers were too big for my hatchback, so I'm guessing it would fit better in a truck or suv.
B00MQDUD5G|4|good lights for the money
B0078HTEL4|5|looks better than the factory original
B00FSG8224|1|Bought 4 of these for my RV and placed then in the kitchen and over the sink.  I would guesstimate PERHAPS 700hrs usage and I am being optimistic.  ALL 4 ARE DEAD at the 10 month mark.  My opinion is these are trash and and a waste of hard earned money.
7138258879|5|Just got them in the mail yesterday they were not bent or folded but they were too small to go on a side of my car and too large to go on my wings. But they really look nice too bad I can't use them
B00BHK9ZW6|3|This part did not come with the tiny spacer pad that is supposed to be attached to the end so I had to go buy one at AutoZone for over $4.
B00199FY16|5|Perfect oe replacement.  Drop it in and go.  No worries. My 94z28 is back to life
B00I3F38OY|1|Didn't fit either of the my vehicles
B0074BO6FS|4|First box came with the pink wrapping melted into the black sealant.  I was able to pull most of it off but some did stay on.  It also had a small crack in the lens.  The second one arrived very quickly and also had the pink wrapping melted and stuck onto the sealant.  Again, I was able to remove most but some did stay on.  No cracks.  The install went fairly smooth, though it will take a bit of trial and error to get the config right (unless you've done it before). The instructions online and on youtube aren't exactly the most accurate for this exact model. They fit my 2009 Yukon XL Denali perfectly.  I did have to adjust the height after installing b/c they did not line up by default.  Overall, I think this is a good product so far.
B00D1FFVKK|5|Im using it on my truck so far it been working good thanks.
B00XZ9PQFW|5|This key fob saved me approx. $160.  The dealer wanted $200 for the key and to program it.
B00XU1PRS6|5|Came in sooner than expected. Perfect fit. Thanks
B000CQ48MS|2|Nice water outlet but it won't fit an 89 Camaro 350 TPI.  Update your info amazon.  Had to return it because its 180 degrees away from where I needed it to be.
B00L524ALC|4|Good product. Always bias to maxima, but would like to see them last through winter road salt and not lose diodes before I leave a 5 Star
B000F0Z81G|5|Nice
B00450B3P2|5|Went together easily; a much more affordable upgrade than new yokes/custom driveline!
B000JFHMZW|4|Folds, creeps. Jeepers!
B00VHWZFY6|5|[[VIDEOID:f0b16630d20b602ea2656a508c76c5df]]These are great if you have a set of tires you want to keep safe over the winter.  I live in Ohio so if we have a set of tires we only use in the summer these are great.  They keep your tire from the elements these fit 13-16 inch tires.  These also makes the tires easy to carry and move.  These are also great for when your taking your dirty tires some where instead of making your vehicle dirty.<br />I got this item at a discounted price for a honest review!
B00DIX339Q|5|Very cool Assassin's Creed logo...<br />Fit very nicely onto my laptop..<br />Fits from top to bottom precisely and very easy to apply.
B001AQZI64|4|Worked well
B00CMS1BQ0|4|Nice stickers
B00BH1FPJW|4|just Acura pride
B00BQVF8NG|1|This is a product that I was absolutely elated to recieve in the mail.  A friend of mine had recently painted his motorcycle with a poor quality sprayer and a total lack of knowledge on how to spray properly leaving what I could only describe as &#34;cantaloupe peel&#34; as the term orange peel doesn't even begin to describe it.  I was asked if it could be saved, and spent many hours wet sanding the bike back down to a flat surface.  This left me with a lot of area with curves and small crevices that needed to be compounded and polished out by hand and this product should have been my savior for that.  Reality was unfortunately not that kind to me.  I began using this with my DA in an inconspicuous area with wonderful results so I moved on to a larger area to really be able to get a good look at the level of correction.  About a minute in I noticed that I was getting a bit of Vibration to which I assumed my pad had come off center, it was actually all of the threads from this product shooting out and spreading little pieces of micronized metal Into my working area.  The damage was pretty bad and had to be wet sanded out again, luckily nothing made it through to substrate and other than a few scuffs that I wasn't able to get out, it worked out well.  All in all this product lasted for less than 10 minutes and created an hour or twos worth of work while simultaneously destroying a brand new pad.  I would recommend this product to no one under any circumstances, and I really hope this item is removed from chemical guys otherwise awesome catalog of products.
B0006MQJ0M|4|Great Product
B00BD9HYGU|5|Very nice! Fast shipping
B00PC0G07A|3|This is NOT leather.<br />However after watching a couple of YouTube instructions it was easy to figure out installation. It comes with two lengths of heavy duty thread and two blunt needles. You will have enough thread to start with a 4&#34; thread 'tail' to tie off at the end and a spare if necessary.  Take your time and undo a mistake if you make one. Always stitch front to back and use existing stitching holes to keep stitching even.  I am happy with it, would have given a 5...but it isn't leather as advertised.
B00GSAUHB8|4|I have a hard time saying that I LOVE a sun protector but it does work well. I like that it has an elastic to wrap around and a little sleeve to put it away in. It's holding up well after daily use and I would buy it again.
B007HH7CMI|1|Didn't last more than a year before it rusted all over the antenna!
B005JU5XYE|5|Buy the best, Buy Bosch for Life
B00IX5MOD0|2|These are really cool when you first install them, but its been less than 4 months and the logo completely looks distorted and faded. No wonder they offer lifetime replacement of the logo disks, but who wants to go through the hassle of ordering new chips and having to go through the headache of having to install them....this was cool for the first couple of months, but due to poor quality of logo chips...its a return....
B00J594B5C|5|works great!
B003LMJP4Q|5|This is a great polish and it works to remove small scratches. A little bit goes a long way.
B009FUF6DM|5|I cut these in half, took a lighter, melted the exposed edges lightly, and used these for my swifter sweeper. They fit well enough. I had just folded them over but found I got too much friction. They pick up more dirt and hair than the swifter sweeper pads and wet mop pads. I have two bags; one for the dirties and one for the clean ones. I wash in separately in the machine on cold and cool dry. Also, no fabric softener and static guard. Just detergent and water! They last a really long time this way. They are a great size for dusting, cleaning electronics, and general household cleaning. I even saved a scrap to put in my glasses case to clean my sunglasses. So many uses! Amazon basics is much less expensive than the other brand so I don't mind cutting up a few and experimenting. :)
B00KGNVWEY|4|Arrived quicker than projected and everything fit great.  The hub caps that come with the package are loose and I would not recommend using them.  I took apart my original hub caps and used them with the new badges and they look great.
B0017R5EQK|5|awesome
B000JJOGHK|5|awesome
B001U60T9U|2|Quality not what I expected. I returned the item.
B001QITX3U|5|Dose it work with Yanmar TK3.95??????
B0024E62CU|5|Great add on for the RV
B011AEX6XC|5|I am very happy with this product! It's a good fit, a great capacity, and stays in place. Very practical - well constructed, highly recommend!
B009B8UYIK|5|Perfect fit, love this heat shield.
B000P17NXQ|5|Very nice item.
B004X96E4U|5|Exceeded my expectations.  Easy to apply, covered scratches and they disappear.  I used a thin paint brush to apply and it went on seamless.  Scratches disappeared.  Very happy with this and would definitely purchase again!  Hopefully I won't need to.
B002UC17HG|5|perfect fit for 1978 boat
B00HCQA7S0|5|installed in an hour or so alone.  looks as good or better than the dealer step bars that cost 5X.
B004YJPBLG|5|Ok
B00J4P7X3O|5|With my 25 year old Pontiac I had a choice between cheap $15 rotors and high performance brakes, and I'm glad that I spent the money on these- the ceramic pads require a little extra effort for the first one or two stops in the morning, but after that smooth stopping. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase these brakes again.
B00K5VA70W|5|Love
B001P29076|5|Good fit
B00U1XOS54|3|On the looks department it's a great product. Install was easy enough with a T25 Hex screw and a phillips head. My biggest beef is that it was nowhere near brighter than the original equipment. I commute daily on my scooter leaving home around 5:30 a.m. and sometimes not arriving home til after 8 p.m. Plus I just like to cruise at night and go to the local coffee bars or regular bars in general. So like a I stated great on looks. Poor on performance as far as a brightness.
B00AZOHPOK|5|can't beat this deal
B000CI8XRC|3|wrong picture,
B008OITWN6|5|These fit my 2015 WRX perfectly. I can even use them while racing without worrying about them coming loose. They retain spills very well and clean up very easily. I sort of wish the rear seat liner wasn't one large piece that spans across the entire back seat foot well. It makes it difficult to remove without getting the dirt it's holding everywhere. I'm sure they had a reason to do it that I am taking for granted, though. Nevertheless, five stars. One of those rare items you see on TV that work well.
B001BLT24C|1|another part again says it fits our 1998 Volvo and it doesn't
B00HHAW6IK|1|You get what you pay for is all in saying. Embed up going with the all balls bearing
B00YT1IAN0|5|Second / Nuts 2016
B009F4JHHO|1|Never worked. Tried it in multiple vehicles.
B0031ZDU62|5|These units look identical to the factory Ford coils I removed. The work as a good replacement. Do not break the bank. Besides Ford's product probably come from the same plant in China. So buy 2 boxes and have 8 spares and still save tons of money. JMHO
B00II5YADC|5|Exactly as described. Already had one and loved it!
B00NJ6163W|5|Absolutely love this decal.
B00VJPIIFY|5|Exactly as described.
B003V57NUQ|4|I'm in agreement with the complaints about the instructions for assembling.  I think what I have determined is that the 2 longer carriage bolts should NOT be inserted through the rubber piece.  Rather, they should be inserted only through the metal piece that attaches to the bottom of the rubber mount.  Then the smaller carriage bolts will be used to hold the rubber mount to the metal plate directly beneath it.
B00VCETMWA|5|I bought this for my 95 Gmc Truck. Fits great!! Looks great, feels nice, and stuck like no other. I get a lot of head turns, and complements on how good it looks. A lot of people ask me who air brushed it for me. haha Soooo worth the money!
B000CMCJ4Q|5|great quality, even had heat shields over plug boots which was better than expected, really good price!
B000BUU5WW|4|Just arrived and I'm looking forward to employing it.
B009FUF6DM|5|Awesome! Cuts down on paper towels! Washes up nicely!
B001OMMV2S|5|Strong construction  they look great
B004TDHWYG|1|does not fit my 2008 Cadillac cts awd direct inject but amazon said it did, not saying they're 1 star for performance, just don't fit this car...
B003UUA610|5|These are high quality and well constructed license plate protectors.  Easy install.  I bought these because of the rash of crimes whereby the date/year stickers are being &#34;razored&#34; off vehicles for the thief's personal use.  They're going to have a much more difficult time trying to steal mine now with these great protectors.  These were a bit more expensive than the others, but they are heavy duty and lay flat against the plate.  They look good too!
B0010DZZSI|5|GOOD
B00JRVWFW4|5|Looks great, worked great
B00RH3AMIS|5|Straps are sturdy, well built and better than I expected.  Their description is accurate.  Spend the extra dollars, you will be pleased.
B00HDMEUCW|5|Love them so much, I bought two more.  They stay put and wash well.
B007KPR79K|5|Works great just does not have the tip over sw. built in. Costs a lot less.
B000BWCFT6|5|This has been used on all of our shower heads and faucet replacements, it's done a good job of preventing drips & leaks
B00F5MU5YY|1|method of securing shower head on wall uses sticky tape which does not hold well when wet.  Or a screw into tile which will cause leak into wall and damage.
B001UCEUZI|1|don't buy this brake pads they are the worst i ever bought they don't stop squeaking they are so loud i had to buy new ones ... don't know why amazon is burning it self with this product same with BP815
B005NLQAHS|5|works excellent.  have tried it on a Dodge Neon 2002 chevy venture 2000 works awsome.
B001GDEAP6|2|The organizer is nice but the measurements are not accurately listed. Had to return it because it did not fit in front of the seat on the hump for a 05 Chevy Puckup.
B001NYTF6W|5|good fit, hard to get to some holes to rivet had to use bolts on some. worked good.
B0061TU2JS|5|Love this product, alot brighter than the stock bulbs, you will need to purchase two units if you have a 2013 Honda Accord, as each mirror has two lights.
B000C2WF9A|4|This fits a 2015 Wrangler
B003PIQ3SW|5|Excellent product!
B00B03NF8K|5|Perfect fit for 2010 Volvo CX90.
B0039Z1UHA|5|Easy to use, looks great on the bike!
B001542OU4|5|Right on
B00CUHORGE|5|Great product
B00QI0203Q|4|fit my truck as I expected it to.
B00CTVGO80|4|Great value
B00MW3DXES|5|Great protection, and I had to replace the stock bumper so that my Superwinch 45 would mount with the Dragonfire front gusset kit. It was a very tight fit however!
B004I14FO4|5|Perfect replacement for the original light. Comes with a new bulb assembly so just plug it in, screw it back in place and you are done.
B0050SFVHO|5|Seems to work just fine. No complaints so far
B000C7RZZ4|5|Good Item,  Best price.  Fast !!
B002G47GE6|5|These are a perfect replacement for OEM.  Easy to install.  Thanks.
B000CF6S2C|2|Item came crack in few location
B0065FRBZ6|5|Works as I hoped.  I attached it to my passenger seat backrest. Drilled 2 holes to accommodate the bolts that hold the backrest to the metal backrest bracket.  Its held up for a while now, we use it to store our cell phones and other small items.<br />looks good, and It appears to be rather durable.
B00GZIR3QU|5|I wasn't excepting much. But, wow bright. We got to the the trail at dust, turn on the lights and wow. Great buy.<br />Heavy duty light with heat sinks.
B00PQZPMYI|2|Wasn't an exact fit
B0000AVZMF|5|* Work great for ramp for truck *
B000BQLQYM|4|It's basically bleach, lol. Well that's what it smells like at least. Works good though.
B00V7V6LNG|4|it works as expected
B000IYNT0Q|5|I like it. Installed easily.
B009LLYXFM|5|Very good
B004I0NQ04|5|Fast shipping, GREAT price!
B0064GKHYI|5|easy to apply has held up well
B004OKJHCY|1|The pictured item is not what I received, the thread on the pictured is longer than the actual
B000GBBP8O|5|This was certainly more effective than going to an autoparts store.  They tried 3 times without success while this was exactly what I needed with one shot.  Great price as well.
B00R3B6HYW|5|It worked perfectly. Takes the guess work and un needed parts replacement out of the diagnostic process..
B00X50CZRI|4|it fit fine on the body, but I can't get it to start. somebody please help!
B00496F0HY|4|Perfect fit for 04 Avalanche and 05 Silverado. Should be good for another 6 months, and at a very reasonable price point.
B00SR1QEAY|5|Works great!
B0005JOBRO|5|This is the absolute best product for interior detailing of your car or truck. It does have a slippery feel so be careful on door edges and boats don't want to fall on your ass... The shine lasts around a month at least try comparing that to armorall hands down this is the best product in category. Thank you sprayway
B009LOO1DS|5|Great. Just like the original... fit well and easy to install. Shipped quickly
B00R383BDU|1|absolute garbage, the gas tank cover doesn't even fit even if you try to cut it. Tank decal has dents in it.should have known better to put it on my bike, at least I only blew $12. Decal extremely  sticky like glue.
B010AJJLJG|5|Good quality stickers, came in a white envelope so don't mistake it for junk mail!
B00SH1SN6C|5|So small but powerful.  Had to use it twice already.  Easy and convenient
B004SMGAJ6|5|Very nice piece!<br />Heavy duty.  Allows infinite adjustability.<br />Looks very capable of towing our boat or a trailer of 4 atv's behind our motorhome.<br />Did plenty of research, made a mistake and ordered a 'fancier' looking aluminum mount which I returned.<br />This is the only mount one will need to haul just about anything your truck would be capable of towing.
B00X3EQJ1O|2|not expensive but it barely works... my length of tubing works much better... much...
B00HRMSRVI|5|Fast service. Good quality! !!
B00S75EPBA|5|Product was just what I needed. Solved my oil leaking problems.<br /><br />I would recommend anybody with a Ford FE
B000CIU8I4|5|Bought it for my father in laws sbc swapped s-10. Works great.
B0051USARO|4|Helped resolve an issue.
B00UIUOBVG|5|Have the low beam 6000k and 5202 fogs 6000k for a 14 Silverado, they look awesome ran into a couple of problems with the fogs contacted opt and took awesome care of me, sent me out replacement ballasts, than sent me a whole replacement, figured out it was nothing they did or the product the 14/15 silverados need an adapter to plug into the factory harness, just takes place of the spade connectors. At the end of the day opt has very helpful costumer service and took care of me! 5/5 any day! Thanks again opt 7!
B004ZF3DYG|5|When i connected both the sides didnot work, thought i got a faulty kit. But up on investigating more, the terminals were not of the same polarity on the connectors with the car's. I had to swap the terminals since the + and - were interchanged on both sides of the connectors. But it is a night and day difference between the stock halogen and this kit. It is still going strong in my car, no issues what so ever. Its a great value for the price, i would strongly recommend this to everyone.
B0010WS4XM|5|Looks exactly as pictured! Super dope, not too big and not too small! LOVE IT!
B000TYSBPI|1|If you are looking for this part for your 1998 Toyota 4Runner, DO NOT BUY THIS!! It does not fit even though it says it will. Fortunately they do accept returns however, you will have to pay for the return postage. Therefor you loose money!
B0031HEIDY|5|Work great
B000CMFULU|5|made hook up to my vehicle as simple as plugging in a toaster
B002ZBPX4A|4|good wipes
B001NAP2Q8|3|easy to install but the oil does leak thru waiting for the fix from K&N
B000IY9CC0|5|thanks good price
B0000AXPDU|1|Nope
B00QB2RT0U|1|Worked the first push and stopped, cheap junk.
B000CC4O58|5|Have fitted this with trailblazer alert as we are not always at the recommended speed for this device. It seems to be working deer and small animals are turning away but not sure if one or both alerts are warning them. Would recommend fitting both to be sure.
B008CE0LIC|5|Good price, easy to carry, easy to hook up, and with the rubber straps I won't have to worry about things falling off.
B00BYX0M3W|4|not too bad to install....will see how it holds up.
B0044AXQAI|5|Product was as expected.
B00JGQLZSU|5|Good oil as good as Mobil-1 or better. I used this on my 2 Mercedes GLK350 and SL65 and the engine has no noise. The Mobil-1 rendered the engine a bit noisy when you listen to it. There was a slight valve tapping. with this Castrol oil there's no tap. I also recommend you stick to the MANN oil filters. They're the original for Mercedes.
B000NW8E94|5|It was perfect and did the trick!
B000H6QWWC|5|Product are exceptional, would recommend someone to buy.
B005KDOAGC|1|Burned out after 5 months of very light use.
B002UC6N0W|5|Perfect fit.  What else can be said.
B00K0T94LC|4|It was recommended by a mechanic. But I can see no difference between  this and cheaper versions of<br />it available in Walmart and other similar places.
B000BQW5LK|5|Works well! No issues and helped my trans fluid maintenance flush a breeze
B00DSVMCSQ|5|What great service from a great seller! Some reviews stated to order next size up. I didn't listen and ordered the wrong size. I was able to exchange for a larger vest with absolutely zero hitches. Thank you! I'd recommend and buy from seller again! The vest is very nice, heavy leather. Plenty of pockets. Good snaps. Just perfect.
B00092COZS|4|Intermittent will not communicate with some bmw, vw models
B00PQWN5DQ|5|works as designed very accurate
B00CH6T18C|1|BooYah?? More like FoolYah.. Not a cleaner, just a conditioner, and pretty average at that!
B00WE47ZUI|1|This product was advertised as a set of two lights.  I ordered 2 sets which should have been a total of 4 lights.  What I received was only 2 lights.  I find this totally unacceptable.  To me this is fraud.  I am not satisfied.
B007Q1DQHK|5|On time and as described. Very pleased with purchase.
B0009PSA4O|5|excellent product
B00QWYO7XO|5|Looks and functions great and nice quality
B00TFZO69C|1|Doesn't fit my Toyota Camry and said it did
B000MILXH4|4|Fit for a 2001 expedition EB was loose. I felt it was a bit pricey for what the product actually was.
B000BQW5LK|5|Works well
B009DKYVTE|5|Perfect! Fits great, easy to install and the seller was great to work with.
B002P2TWIM|3|Bought this for my tent trailer but it was the wrong size (too small). I am not sure what trailers this would fit.
B00VXVQA0Y|4|working fine
B008320ZQ6|5|Excellent quality, comfort, look. Just completed 3400 miles on west coast trip. (8/5 - 8/20/2015) Wore jacket vegas to Malibu then up coast to seaside Oregon. Temp. Ranging from 45 to 85. No liner I put a sweatshirt on a couple of times. Vents great when vents open and keeps air out when closed. In 2 hrs of medium rain on 2 occasions I got damp but not soaked. I never got rain gear out. (I did spray with 2 coats of waterproof before I left) but zippers did great. I buy 2xl for jackets and sweatshirts this was no exception. 2xl fit great. (5-10 245lb 48+chest no 6 pack 18 pack)  Velcro waist tightens nice and snug. Never zipped to my riding pants. Even with jeans it didn't ride up. I felt safe,comfortable and I put the concours 14 thru it's paces. Pacific Coast highway is a fun challenging ride. Hope this helps.
B00RW4NP0O|3|Well just take a look at my pictures and u can see that is not the best spending you can do
B0002F676O|4|Bought this to use with [[ASIN:B002P3KJME Teknor Apex 828VR-25 AquaDrain 5/8&#34; X 25' Grey Water Hose]], works well but the bottom of the flange seems to be almost exactly the same size as the sewer opening at most campsites. It's not a real snug fit and can come off, I always look for a big rock to hold it in place.
B000KKENBM|5|work good
B000IHK1VI|5|I purchased the cooling system vacuum so i could change the coolant in my 2001 Honda Goldwing Gl1800A.<br /><br />It worked great with one exception.  My compressor is only a 4 gallon unit, and it couldn't quite get the the full vacuum that it reccomended, so it didn't suck the entire gallon into the radiator.  I had to let the compressor build up again, then when I went to re-apply the vacuum, I guess it was so violent int the tank that it would pick up some of the coolant and spew it out in a fine mist.<br /><br />Once I got the rest of the coolant into the bike I backed it out onto my driveway and gave the bike a nice wash to get the coolant off.
B01257LSOC|5|High Quality Decal!
B004UARNHO|5|The right locks for my 2015 Chevy Silverado 6 lug OEM wheel.  See my detailed review of the McGard 24210 which are too long.
B00DBENGU8|1|They are terrible! LED my ass they are like a 10 watt bulb! DO NOT BUY!!
B000C5YCO8|5|These were an exact fit for my Toyota
B00379ABX2|1|If you feel like spending an hour removing a sticker that the company puts on the front of each sign then these are the signs for you. Very poor planning and placement of an extremely adhesive sticker! Rediculou
B000CNN0QG|4|I am giving this four stars.  One for price, one for fit and finish, one for that flowmaster sound.  and one more for easy install.  What is missing is durability.  Mine lasted five years and about 25000 miles.  When it completely rotted out, i shopped and deliberated and finally bought the same thing again.  What it gains for easy install and PERFECT fit far overshadows the sting of longevity.
B000234IT4|5|I finally had to use it..... I had almost 34,000 pounds on my set of drive axles when a tire blew up on my way out of a parking lot... It seemed to lift and hold the weight of my fully loaded truck effortlessly while I spent an hour and a half peeling off the old tire and beating on the spare.
B004002CS4|2|works, but that's about it. Don't like the 2&#34; adapter, you have to bolt/unbolt everytime you use it. Does not fit 2 adult bikes very well, they rub or contact each other. would not purchase again, recommend the &#34;ladder&#34; style, even if you need the adapter for womens bike.
B00GL3W23I|5|Great light, high quality. If you have any issues, the company talks with you and is very quick to solve any issues you may have.
B007Y0MY6M|5|Excellent truly heavy duty straps that are also outdoor safe (many aren't).  Worst mistake people often make is using regular bungee cords (even seemingly heavy duty ones) that are not designed for lengthy outdoor weather use.  These are safe for securing cargo in a pickup over long distances even in bad weather.  They are at an excellent price point and the best you can get when safety of your cargo is important.
B001PTCTL8|5|Worked perfect, pump like new
B00R0SBFV8|5|Perfect fit. Great quality. Excellent price.
B0002KR88A|5|perfect!!
B00T6B5SWO|5|Exactly what I ordered. Fast shipping, cute packaging. Looks awesome installed on my car!

B00ED3HY3Q|3|pricey,not for home
B00T0DS85M|5|Needed it for my 88 JS550, fit great. Even came with a mounting bracket (plastic) Luckily I haven't needed to use it!
B0022UP8XA|5|This cover is worth every penny! I made the mistake of trying another cover once my Guardian wore out, after 7 years of service. Needless to say I have since re-ordered the Guardian. My only suggestion would be to step up a size from what the fitment chart recommends. I use the XL cover on my 2008 vrscdx and it recommends a LARGE. The cover hangs a little lower but fits perfectly. I'd rather have a little extra on the cover than it not cover completely.
B00PKRW0LK|5|Really great product.  Easily seen and makes me comfortable when driving with my 16 year old granddaughter, she feels less pressure to and there is less horns beeping and more room given behind.  I would highly recommend these.  Magnet is strong and sticks to metal, it may seem like it us not strong enough to hold but it does..we haven't lost one yet and it has been a couple of months.m
B00T36LJF2|4|ok
B00G9W95IQ|5|Great bag
B00029JMXA|1|Bought this for my dad for his birthday.  He put it on his pickup and it will not twirl. I cannot return it because of the return policy. Be careful not to buy things for gifts too much in advance that the return by date passes before the person has even been able to try it out.
B00N7CPFRQ|5|Yep!! This works! Hate paying the stealership high bucks. My car is a 2000 740i and is in between resetting the oil service interval indicator using the dash and code reader. This works great. Make sure the key is in position 2 ( the on position) it won't work in position 1 (accessory) position.
B002LGXX8M|4|Works just fine keeps items secured and dry.
B00EARM188|5|My fav ashtray of all time! good amount of cigar holders and it's Montecristo!
B00M1Y7M86|5|Great oil at a great price.
B000EDUUG2|1|BAD DESIGN!! the handle doesn't lock so you have to hold the broom part while you sweep. don't waste your money!!!
B00GX6EINU|5|Vive Colombia!  It's now on my laptop.  Sad they don't have more right now
B001MOSE1K|5|This is perfect.  We have an older honda with a problem opening the passenger window from the driver side.  We installed this power window master and, voila! it worked.  Good price, arrived on time, I'd order again in a minute.
B001GG8DWO|5|long lasting and super cute
B0074GRN7G|1|It was the wrong part.
B00IJF0UQM|5|I have these lights on every vehicle I own and believe me....they are the brightest lights on the road! Pure lightening white with a hint of light blue. Easy to install!
B00KJLMDE6|5|Thank you....... there fine.
B00267PZUK|5|this tool works like a champ ive never change the spark plugs on my 05 f150 5.4 since i got it 4 yrs ago so i broke 6 out of 8 of my plugs but with this tool it was real easy removing the remaining part. im not a mechanic but got the job done
B000EEU0IO|5|Avoid to get sweaty, massage your back... Works great.
B003P64XU4|3|ok nothing special
B00T8UYCHA|5|mounted to motorcycle for use when on the road all alone and it works great!  Definite daylight extender!
B00TP11HTS|5|I have purchased 3 of these in the past year and have not been disappointed!  Great device!!
B00066UKMG|2|Ok, so considering the amount of work to replace these things, they should last longer There are too many comments here and on other sites that confirm the lifespan of this replacement part is very poor.  Therefore the part is kind of a waste of time. Does anyone know a better quality part source that isn't very expensive? Somewhere on YouTube I saw a video about a $50 part for the pair; that seems way to high.
B00O6PGCSO|5|Very cute! My only fear is that is does look like it can very much break eventually.
B00H55X5M8|5|I have an '02 Yamaha Warrior and it was very easy to install once you take the rear fender liner out.  The light is bright and strobes when you first put the brakes on, making visability much greater.  The wires are color coated to the stock wires, so it only takes one mintue to do the wiring itself.  The directions that come are easy to understand  and give great trouble shooting advice.  It also indicated that the light is not waterproofed, and when I read some other reviews, I did what they said and put a little siIicone sealant around the wires that come out of the back, and that seems like it'll do the trick.  I also did a little modification and cut off the mud flap that comes off the fender liner to give it a cleaner look, and mounted a lighted vertical side mount licence plate holder.  It blinks faster than before but there is a relay that'll slow it down.
B003SZVA6C|5|Great replacement
B003SS62PS|4|use it to help move the air throughout the large SUV during road trips
B0006IX7UQ|5|Perfect for a small dorm fridge and perfect little ice cubes, not too small!
B00415CKEE|4|came on time and did the job
B0021YZER2|5|I have had a Tacoma for over a year and have tried EVERYTHING to get the water spots off of the windows.  It was driving me crazy.  I even thought about getting rid of my truck.  (that went away pretty quick)  I ordered this product and after some elbow grease this stuff is MAGIC!  My windows are back to normal, I love this stuff.  Stress relieved.
B00D8I6A4Q|5|Looks good
B011RZ12HQ|4|Very easy to pair with a car, works as described. Range is a little limited, but still very happy with purchase. Would recommend.
B0067UDW7U|5|Came on time and was easy to install also I didn't know it was gonna be brand new low price but high quality
B000ALG86E|5|Works well! I live in a city and have issues with bird dung being dropped on my car, so I bought this to protect the paint job. Every so often some poo comes through, but for the most part it does its job very well! A bit tedious to take on and off each day but once you get the hang of it, the process isn't so bad.
B003LRSGEQ|1|The yellow is the right one!
B00FZ3TF6W|4|Calipers are great, the red looks awesome!  The only reason I'm giving 4 stars and not 5 is that there were some chips in the powder coating that appear to be due from mishandling at the manufacturer.  The calipers come in three boxes.. the actual shipping box, another smaller box inside the shipping box, and then each caliper is in their own box inside that box.  The cardboard boxes the calipers were in were torn and damaged, however the other boxes they were in were perfect.  I emailed Callahan via Amazon, they responded very quickly and asked me to call them.  I did call them, and I basically wanted to make sure the chips in the powder coating wouldn't compromise the calipers down the road (rust).  They said they would be fine.
B007O5GXOG|5|Straight out the box and installed in my Tacoma in less than an hour. Tested with trailer unloaded and loaded. Works better than reviews stated. This brake controller hits a home run!
B00KY0A96G|5|Reasonably priced, shipped fast. Seems to be quality built.<br /><br />Have a couple hundred miles on it at this point in time and seems to be doing a great job thus far!<br /><br />Thanks
B00V5QUWMO|5|Good stuff
B00L9F3EO4|5|Awesome light....only problem was it is NOT the color I ordered...asked for amber and white....got blue
B000JZGEVA|1|not used
B0051MYLS4|2|The handle breaks easily!
B00MUAI7JO|5|Used these in my auto hauler interior to replace the 921 Miniature bulbs.  Also used them for the bed illumination lights on my 2012 GMC Denali.  They work really well.  They are +/- sensitive so you may have to turn them around if they don't light when installed.
B006NZTZLQ|3|Have a significant amount of experience with OBD2 devices and various softwares for Android and Windows including Torque Pro (Android-Bluetooth), Car Gauge Pro (Android-Bluetooth), Scan XL Pro (Windows - both OBDLinkSX USB and Bluetooth devices), and HP Tuners with Proprietary USB interface.<br /><br />I have been using the BAFX Bluetooth device (from here on Amazon) for a year with Torque Pro on my Android.  Recently started using Car Gauge Pro because of it's extended functionality (ABS, SIR, etc) in an Android app.  Problem is many of the available modules stated &#34;Requires OBDLinkMX&#34; when selected and loaded.  So I bought this OBDLinkMX for about 3x the cost.  Now the same exact modules just say failed to connect (or something like that).<br /><br />One of my vehicles, a 2006 G6 (one of the first years for the CAN protocol) has never connected with the BAFX bluetooth adapter.  However it will connect fine with both the OBDLinkSX/ScanXLPro and the HP Tuners software/interface.  This $90 OBDLinkMX bluetooth adapter did not solve any issues connecting with this vehicle.  Neither bluetooth adapter will connect.<br /><br />I did not quantify the polling rate for this adapter but it really does not seem any speedier than the BAFX in my 2008 Ford Ranger or my 2001 Blazer.  Note that speeds on both adapters are acceptable, but seem like an order of magnitude slower than the OBDLinkSX or Proprietary HPTuners interface.<br /><br />So even though it works generally OK (seemingly as well as any bluetooth OBD2 adapter I am aware of), I am seeing no added value to this OBDLinkMX OBD2 adapter over the $23.99 BAFX clone FOR MY VEHICLES and I am returning it.  Maybe it does more on newer vehicles than the BAFX, but that is not what I have and is not what I have experienced.
B009F10S3Y|5|I'm putting 5 stars so people can see it first,<br /><br />I have bought easy lip in the past for my GTS Lancer and it looks great made it look lower and everything... But when I went to home depo one day I saw pretty much the exact same thing for more than half the price... GARAGE DOOR BOTTOM RUBBER! yes I'm serious... I was so pissed that I would have bought that for 9 bucks and it's rubber and not this cheap easy to rip stuff and this stuff costs 30 bucks! No way, now I have an integra and I bought the garage door bottom rubber and yes it's a bit more work but you're saving 20 dollars, so in my opinion it's worth it! This is what it looks like the the garage stuff, do you see a difference? Because I don't, and yes I had to make holes in the lip it has but I only needed to make 4 and it's on the bottoms no one would ever notice. But it's up to you guys! Just thought to give my 2 cents about it.
B00SQ2GEJA|5|worked out perfect
B000FW4LT4|5|These are the best! Inexpensive, solid and a wonderful brass blade to _really_ get all that ice off.
B00KPWUEUE|5|Perfect fit, strong and sturdy.  Flag mount slightly angled so flag stands straight up and Flag won't lean towards rider.  Nice shine Finish.
B000ETAPX4|2|When I read some of the reviews I thought the scent would be stronger than the trees but it isn't.<br />This scent is very faint and not strong at all but I really love this scent
B008O9DMTA|5|Fits the sinks in our 1970s travel trailer.  Much easier to wash dishes when your water isn't leaking out due to the old ones!  These are one of those inexpensive but easy to overlook items.  I wish I had made sure our old ones still sealed before our first camping trip, nothing more frustrating than your wash water leaking out while doing dishes.  I couldn't find these anywhere in our home town, much less in the nearest town to where we were camping.  We keep a spare with us now since they are very inexpensive but hard to find locally.
B009SCSXVO|5|Works great
B003KX2BEM|2|the fit is not perfect the trim is good all around but the fit is not seemless it needs a bit push and tug and the wiring which came with it does fit a lexus 2009 as per my request but again as it is an online purchase i kept it cuz its too much problems to return it
B008ETMV8I|5|Went through quite a few bungie straps in my day. These are hands down the best ones and they are adjustable. I leave my bike out in the sun and there hasn't been any fading in 5 months. No diminish in strength or elasticity either.
B0093JUOW8|1|Fits good and looks great.  Only thing is reding the reviews I noticed some people got switches wires backwards and when my bike Wouldn't start I switched it to off and it started right up, which pretty much defeats the whole Purpose.  Cut and switched main wires around and works great now.
B00HS8CDR0|5|WeatherTech mats are the best.  They are not cheap, but totally worth the money.  Especially living in New England.  All that snow, salt, and sand in the winter will make your car look like crap after a couple of days without protective mats.  They are one of the best investments you can make to protect the interior of your car.  And because they are custom for your model, they fit perfectly, there is no sliding around.  The ones I have have these buttons on the bottom that hold them in place.  They're the same buttons as the mats that came with the car, so everything stays put.  They are easy to clean, just rinse them off and done!  Low maintenance cleaning is my kinda cleaning!  Buy them, they're worth it.
B00KTSPAFI|5|Purr-fect!
B000GTTJAM|2|Before purchasing I did see some reviews that said that once started, liquids would not keep flowing so it was necessary to keep pumping the whole time.  I was skeptical and thought they must have been doing something wrong.  Well they were right, no matter how high I lift the gas can, the gas will not keep flowing which makes this thing impractical for me.
B006RGO8GI|5|I bought this for my niece but I wanted to keep it! Love the design and colors. Appears to be nice ink but with decals, the proof is in how the do once they are on your car, and since this one won't be on my car, I may not know. I plan to order one for myself though because its really a nice design, great colors.
B000HTNODE|5|Very nice product--easy to use and more trustworthy than a floating ball hygrometer. The whole kit of consists of the refractometer and small accessories like a pipette for taking a sample and tools to adjust and maintain the instrument all packaged in a protective case. I expect to get many years of reliable service from it.
B00ONHNVFW|1|Bolt holes didnt line up and the motor is wired backwards to the switch. Very disappointed with the product. Tried to contact seller with no response. Hotrible customer service.  The factory motor has bolts that gold it in place this low quality reolacment has studs on the motor its self and doesnt come with the nuts to mount it either. Just all around bad experience.
B003RYOWH8|5|Great product and price.
B005E9XQXK|5|It came in good condition
B00BGZ1TYO|5|Great fit and function.  I like it a lot!
B00H1LP4EI|1|Was advertised as a k&n it's definitely cheap Chinese knockoffs and one of the filter elements were crushed when arrived stay away from this and don't use them in your bike
B0007V9X8M|5|Installed on my 1998 S-10 and it fit perfectly with no modification to the truck.  A little heavy for one person to install, but I got it done.
B00CA6UTV2|4|Looks good , Certianly is on the lightly built side . Wouldn't be really putting it to a test more of a looks than function
B001MOYXOC|5|Works great! Little stiff at first but I'm sure it'll break in eventually
B006L78VUW|5|Excellent quality. Sturdy construction
B003PJM8US|2|Bought this for a 2009 Pontiac Vibe.  Came with the wrong bolts, had to go buy the correct ones.  Easier to do this than return the receiver.  When installed, the receiver sits so close to the muffler, the muffler intermittently vibrates off the receiver from normal road use.  The only positive was that it took only 30 minutes to install.  If I did not have to run a tap through the bolt holes to clean them out, install would have been about 10 minutes.
B00U0YRAMW|1|Headlight glass cracked after turning headlight on for first time ...was outside 30 days so I couldn't return
B0002STSC6|5|excellent!!
B00IA265XQ|3|no place on the handle bar to mount it.
B00SLHKZ7M|5|I use this bag to carry my lunch on my commute to work each morning.  It fits perfectly inside it.  Quality & design of the bag is great!
B000EVU89I|5|excellent!!
B00GBRG4TC|5|Popped right into place and was $5 cheaper than the filter at &#60;insert generic national auto supply chain name&#62;
B00LBAJRIE|1|It sucks. It doesn't work and they won't give me a refund.
B00JGJGLWW|5|This is one tough battery cable.<br />Used with<br />Marinco 701 Battery Disconnect Switch .
B00KMKWWGS|5|Better than what the car came with
B00DJ5KE9A|4|works good
B007ZI5CT4|1|One worked the other didn't!
B00MWNZ1B6|1|Loudest wipers I've ever owned and I've owned a POS jeep wrangler with dry rotted wipers. How embarrassing for such a nice car to fart with every wipe.
B00BNFVY10|5|This is a great product. Looks good and feels good when you are driving. Lots of people like the looks of it.
B00527Z664|4|Great unit... works exactly as expected. I am using it to power a 27 inch 40w LED TV in my travel trailer. It is a tad bit noisy from the cooling fan, but is expected as it is not a Pure Sine wave inverter. (which are more expensive) I am not sure on the duration that this can run as I have not run it longer than 3 hours as it usually is run late night so no generator is needed to watch TV. I expect that it can run all night if needed on dual batteries.
B007P8718O|5|Very high quality. Leather and padding on the palm side. Super comfortable. Would buy again. I usually wear a size small. I bought a size medium and they fit perfect.
B001V8U12M|5|Works like a charm, much faster and easier than cranking. Also good for emergencies if the slide out has to be moved manually.
B005Z8HAUK|1|This thing is a piece of JUNK. I've used it 3-4 times now. It only works for about 3 minutes before turning off. barely long enough to fill one tire partially with air. I thought maybe this was a fluke so I said let me drive around with it plugged into the chargr just in case it has an internal battery to make sure that this will last longer the next time I used it. I drove around for over an hour, used it again and the same happened. It turned off again in less than 3 minutes. This crap is going back to the store. I dont know if I got a bad one or if Slime is just slime all-together. I will be researching other brands.
B007ZLM6SG|4|not a greaseable, but ok
B00CYLD3R0|5|These are perfect. They fit a 2013 lexus es300 like a boss
B000BZG8ZA|5|After chasing threads, installed without issue and wiring connected well.  5.4L running better.  Had to coil up excess wire to protect.
B00976L174|5|Works great!
B00CP3X1WE|5|My husband was very happy with the cover.  Heavy duty quality and perfect fit
B008FQK4TI|1|You do not want one of these. Bought one about a year and a half ago. Recently broke and mfr. wants $7-800 for new part. Lousy warranty.  WILL NOT LAST ! Unless you want to keep paying for it over and over buy something else. Plastic end covers on the cylinder break among other problems. Very, very poor considering what these things cost.
B00KPR9Q30|5|this is a worth wild upgrade if you have a two tank system on your RV. The ability to know which tank is empty and then be able to change it without shutting off the gas will make life so much better during those colder days out enjoying the great outdoors.
B00CX7KV3E|1|No Bracket, no wiring diagram, pretty poor all the way around!!
B008JORKP2|5|Sturdy well built and puts out lots of heat!!!
B003OSIHXW|1|This 26&#34; blade is trash. Bought at Costco, it would not lay down to the curvature of our 2006 Accord, and the wiper element separated from its backing. Bought a second blade thinking I had a lemon with the same results.
B009AA5QJ6|5|These are a fast and simple alternative to having to use spring compressors to put new struts in your vehicle.  Whether you're an experienced mechanic, or a novice wrench-turner, these simplify the job and make it safer.
B00DSD6GFY|2|Was really bummed out about this one. Just peeling the decal off the backing made the vynil stretch so it would've been physically impossible to stick with no bubble/wrinkle. Also they overlapped the decal on the paper so paper was stuck on a piece of the sticker. Went right in garbage.
B007NIH9FQ|5|I work with a landscaper hand pulling weeds and planting all day. I have a size 7 hand and the small fit well. These gloves keep my hands cool in warm weather better than any other gardening gloves I've tried. They are also the most durable gloves I've tried and don't have an overpowering rubber smell like most gloves.
B00O826XKM|5|The app store is growing. It started a bit slow but looks like its sped up quite a bit as new developers are starting to get on the platform. So far my favorite uses of the device are tracking the location of my car and the health checker, especially when taking longer trips.
B00YB5GAEA|4|Good product.  Be careful of the mount point where the light go through the actual band. If it gets bumped too hard, the light will dismount from the band, however, on a bike ride it should hold okay.  Charging is easy (usb mini) and doesn't take too long for a full charge.
B00TWR8T1Y|1|wth is this? its made of rubber and small hard to install on vehicle if you dont have side skirts already. i should of paid the extra 100 and got the real deal dont be cheap. buy the real side skirts because these are cheap look lame and hard to return.
B009APIXRI|5|While on my last trip my Red brake with the air compressor finally failed.  It drained the toad battery and would not charge up.  At an RV rally I bought this Patriot.  Wow! what a great device compared to the Red or Tan units with an air compressor.<br />It bleeds the vacuum during set up.  Total set up time is about 60-90 seconds versus 5 minutes with the air compressor types.  One telling item, the power cord is a pair of 16 or 18 gauge conductors, the other was 14 gauge and needed it all.<br />This company makes great products and this is one of them.
B00LMD9U82|5|love it
B00LXJTUM6|5|Love my new frame! Support pits.
B003NTV8FQ|5|Perfect !
B00BTLEIIY|5|Really like them. Thanks
B000HBM85C|5|This lube is great for EBC Yellow and drilled/slotted rotors (Stage 5) on a 2009 VW Routan SEL minivan (Dodge Caravan in VW Badging). That's what I use them for. and I'd do it again if it weren't for those meddling kids.
B00BFU4VEU|5|We just installed this unit on our 34 foot travel trailer to replace a dometic Duo therm Penguin model and this thing is GREAT!  Considerably quieter, the remote is wonderful, and it even can act as a dehumidifier via the Dry function!  We rented some scaffolding locally and installed it ourselves for $50!  We didn't buy through Amazon due to several folks mentioning beat up boxes and missing parts/instructions via the UPS shipping (we spent about $150 more thru a local dealer and it was shipped via truck and received it in 3 days and everything was in the box (including the sealing gasket)).  allows normal conversation and normal TV volume levels (something no Dometic model we have had ever did) and looks GREAT.  Also provides better air circulation than any Dometic we have had ever did.  VERY EASY to clean the filters too!  UPDATE 12/02/15: We have had some very cool nights and this thing actually produced some very comfortable heating even down into the low 30's.  I don't claim to understand it all but it seems the &#34;defrost cycle&#34; allows this to happen.  We did not expect it to produce any significant heating below 45 degrees so having it produce enough heat to keep more than 240 square feet in the 70's at 33 degrees outside temps is a sure winner.  Additionally, it did a wonderful job of cooling the same space on a few days above 10 degrees.  And it has what is called a &#34;Dry&#34; mode that acts as a limited dehumidifier which also worked well during some very humid days in SC during those rains that produced so much flooding!  We are still very much pleased with this unit!
B00XULVDHK|5|These arrived promptly and are exactly as described. I am very pleased with this pair of window clings. They take all of 10 seconds to install and stay put. They are safer than the ones on a roller and remain attached to the window without having to reposition and reattach a suction cup constantly. I would buy these again from this excellent seller!
B004KED8CO|5|Works fine and the price was great. I have a bigger one but this is much smaller and easier to store/transport.
B000NE7TJ8|5|Exactly what I needed good price.
B00O5PDE3Q|2|They look neat but they don't really hold keys properly.  Megatron worked but the other two don't let keys poke out far enough to function.
B00FO6Q6E4|5|Placed it on the rear of son's car, and people make sure to give my son room while he drives.  Son is more comfortable driving.  Excellent!
B00JF53ZEE|3|I like this product. I would even recomened it. However I have 3 problems with it. I purchased this for a specific item that I transport regularly. On the specifications on Amazon it says that it is 20.8 inches wide. Which would have been perfect. My item is 20.5 inches. I was surprised that when I assembled the cargo carrier (easy assembly fyi) my item didn't fit. I got out a tape measure and it read just over 19.5 inches. Then I looked at the box and on the box it says it is only 20 inches even. (see pictures) I am still able to use the cargo carrier but my item has to sit at an angle.  My second issue is that the images that are provided exagerate how much the hitch/toung is curved. I went with this product because I thought it would give me more clearence. I would say that the cargo carrier gives just 2 inches of more clearence. In the Photo I think It looks like It looks like the hitch/toung would give at least 4 inches of clearance. FYI I drive a Jetta.  Lastly... One of the bolts broke before I even used it. There are two bolts that hold a cross piece for the cargo carrier. One of them the head broke off and I found it in my drive way after I installed it on my car. I hadn't even loaded it up and driven away before it broke. (see picture) I believe it was defective and not the standard but it still happened.  I think this is a decent product. You just can't trust what it advertises the dimensions to be. And for me it made all the difference.  P.S. After writing this review I did discover that the seller answered a question and specified the correct dimensions. Please get it fixed on your posted dimensions.
B00D39LKMC|5|Really easy and great quality for the price.
B00N396SHE|5|Great product A+
B00MMKDVIO|5|perfect fit , good quality and will buy again for my other vehicles.
B004I1CS70|4|came with a defective blinker lamp, had to swap it out with my old one.<br />Otherwise than that, very happy with the light assembly.
B000KQ0IFG|1|I ordered these for an '05 Tundra Access Cab. The front pieces are as advertised...went in great.<br /><br />The rear pieces are a joke. I had thought they would allow the rear windows to open and not allow rain/weather in as the front pieces do. Not the case at all. They actually attach to the glass. They serve no purpose at all except to look the same as the front window. After calling weathertech, the gal that answered confirmed this. Don't be duped. Continue your search for the ones that allow the rear windows to open.
B002QFGI94|5|Beyond pleased. I noticed the difference right away after installment, which by the way is a breeze if you have the right tools. The only mishap was that mine didn't come with the correct sticker (huge problem, i know) ... I got a hold of someone down there, explained to them my concern and within a week it arrived in the mail. To my surprise, the guy went out of his way to not only provide me the correct sticker, but to stock me with stickers and other cool brand name material for days.
B00AKFS49E|5|SWEET! Sound great, fairly easy to install, look nice too! Very pleased!
B00ABZB4PO|5|Friend who I bought it for loves it.
B001O25GA2|5|Perfect for the kitchen.
B00206JCTM|4|works fine
B000MMVOOW|5|Perfect fit!  Now to find a place to store it.
B009CGTLJY|5|great part
B00IUV846I|5|Lcd is great, 6Amp to 7amp hr application.  Cranks scooter awesome.
B005Y5TW0K|5|Was hesitant to buy a helmet without trying it on, but followed the guideline for measuring my head that is with this helmet and it fits perfect. It is a beautiful girly helmet, with a matte white background and beautiful pink and silver artwork. Love it, and I can wear my glasses or sunglasses in it with no trouble.
B001TCXOTW|5|I was looking for a way to wire a brakelight kill switcg to my dash and kept falling short of a solution.  Finally, I found these guys!  With a few relays and a little creative wiring (I'll leave the details to your imagination), I can now kill my brake lights with the flip of a switch!  It also kills the backup lights!
B009I6BEDY|5|FIT PERFECT
B001EEXLSY|5|Still pending install. They arrived fast and are up to the quality I expected. :)
B00063X7KG|5|works great in picking up stuff that you don't see. its like magic, will make your detail job more professional and get you better result. you don't want that extra dirt on your polishing pads
B000BRQ0TW|1|I'm sure this stuff sets up fine, but I tried to use it to fix a leak on the bottom of an aluminum boat and the stuff just will not adhere to the aluminum. It sticks fine to your fingers and to itself though, so if you need to putty up one of those, buy this product! Otherwise, it's a waste of your time and money.
B00E1SLM18|4|I've had to replace my pads n rotors previous used factory parts n still wore thru them quickly.. these are great quality n have a great stopping power to them
B005NLQAHS|4|This item works ok. I didnt like how it was difficult  to connect to my phone and i sent it back. I just ordered the more expensive one.
B0009IR0PQ|5|great
B000PA00XM|5|works right out of the box. took me like 25 minutes to install on my 2005 BMW Z4.
B00KPWBBLA|5|These are a great fit at an outstanding price.  They really look good on my Jeep.
B000C2WEY6|4|I don't close it all the way as I wasn't able to reopen it up easily but you can't beat the price.
B00QPQD1NQ|1|Fell apart almost immediately.
B00CU8ZEZQ|5|These work well, are durable, are longer than the aluminum version, and should last a lifetime.
B000CITK8S|5|Works great
B000RLPNLI|4|Exactly as described; works great, and the price was reasonable!
B001SIFPNK|4|Didn't come with enough screws
B00IOU1BPQ|5|Great I can feel the power and sounds good
B000C8T96Q|5|good product
B009L3BVPA|5|good quality.
B00BY24LJY|1|Shirt is nice but when I wore it for the first time my wife and son noticed a HUGE stain on the back! Make sure you look at it before you even put it on. Me being a trial and error person figured I would wash it but no results, stain is still there.
B000I04Z7Q|5|One of the best purchases ever.<br />They came in a small box and straight out of the box you were ready to install, nothing really to it, power to power, ground to ground.<br />GREAT variety of colors and options, they perform like no other, especially for the price, but the installation for my 06' Dodge Charger was a nightmare, fuse box is in the trunk, and power was almost impossible to find (rigged it to the drivers power seat), mounting them wasn't easy, but not impossible. (the 3M tape that came for the little box didn't work at all for me ended up using velcro strips)<br />As far as brightness they are impressive, pretty bright at night no complaints there<br />Day you can barely see them (for obvious reasons) not really a complaint<br />The sound dancing option is great, but I listen to a lot of trap or fast paced music, so sometimes I have to turn it up pretty loud for it to catch most of the beats, also has a strobe limiting option so you don't have a seizure while driving. It's also a little delayed on the beat flashes, but not too far off to where it's annoying, but I can hardly complain at all on that.<br />Don't know about the legality of these, but sitting outside of the car it's difficult for anyone to see the reflection of the light if it's only in the foot wells, so likely they won't even notice it. Unless they're in a much higher vehicle than you. If they do, it's not that distracting while driving.<br />Gets looks everywhere, also it's awesome on battery life, I accidentally left them on when I worked a 9 hour shift, NO drain to my battery at all, started up fine and lights were still going strong. Friends think it's awesome, and the pulsing color changing option is my favorite, great buy, just really difficult to install for my model car, prepare the zip ties and tape. Even more difficult if you have no experience in cars, wiring, or any of that.
B006TMM4NE|3|Ultimately worked but had to unhook where the headlight wires attach to frame to give more wire room.  The headlights twist on different ways on this assembly than on the stock one. Also had gap where it meets fender.
B00BD4JRQA|1|Unless you want to spend 3 hours getting sticky tape off the back then I would probably go a different route!
B000C5GB4M|1|Didn't work. Constantly released fluid. Returning it was effortless.
B0002RNSLO|5|Good easy to hook up.
B00FOKONJ0|4|It did cover well but I made the mistake of not removing old leather protectors with a leather cleaner before applying. The next application will be put on after a through cleaning, but it still yielded a 70% coverage. I'm happy with current look of the sofa compared to previous.
B00JUI7VW8|5|Voltage is about .07 volts high compare to my Fluke but as long as you know it shouldn't be an issue. The charging ports work great. Have ordered a few more for other projects.
B004RVCRXG|5|These fit well and seem to light the way from the front all the way around to the side.  Very bright, brand new look that exceeded my expectations.  I feel safe once again in the old van.
B007MHKP4A|5|Nice small size.
B001JT3Q0C|1|I intended to use this antenna on a Polaris Ranger. I wanted something that functioned but was flexible and not expensive. This delivered on two out of three - it was flexible and not expensive. It also could not deliver a better SWR match than 3:1 regardless of how the rings were adjusted or changing the length of the antenna. I'm now shopping again for an antenna. The match was so bad with this antenna that it would be dangerous to the radio to use it.
B00UM58RUI|5|Great helmet especially for the price. Excellent
B00P5YOU3O|5|Delivery faster than predicted. Product just as described.
B001J7CO02|5|I mounted them under the sleeper on my Peterbilt. There's a channel there that made mounting easy. Air tank nearby. Ran wire along the sleeper heater hoses to the firewall then hooked into horn coupling disabling the electric horn. Horns work even better than I had hoped. Nice and loud. I have had the horns in use for a few weeks now and very happy with purchase. When kids give the hand gesture to honk horn they go crazy when they hear this horn.
B00KUI13C6|5|These will fit great for the vanity mirror lights in a 2015 Subaru Legacy
B0101A0C38|5|Up yours Hillary!
B000JFN9WW|5|A must for a professional technician. Using it for brake bleeding, correcting fluid levels, extracting fluids, you name it.  The pneumatic sure beats the pump style that I once had.
B00LG07MZE|2|I measured the sunshade carefully before ordering for my 2011 Honda Odyssey. Measurement wise, the fabric does cover the whole windshield, however, the problem is that the supporting frames inside the shade are not big enough to be held up by the visors. It was pretty much useless until I had to improvise: I put a rubber band around the visor, so when I prop the shade up, I can slip the corners of the fabric under the rubber band. It's workable now, but still inconvenient as I have to climb to the other side to put on and off the shade.
B00IKKS4W8|5|Way nicer than the factory Jacks I took off my camper.
B00VJ50Q4K|5|special
B00GWWUFSM|5|good quality and fit
B002QPSNS8|5|I have a gunmetal gray truck with chrome wheels. These nutz look great on the back.<br /><br />Solid construction and quite large.
B00MW8G99O|1|I tried with every single set of instructions on the web. No luck. I have a 2004 Honda CR-V EX. So maybe this only works on the LX model I am thinking. Waste of time.
B00KTHZ2EI|2|Broke within  a few weeks.  On my third one.
B00ODFOCOS|5|Excellent net/cargo for just packing up and go. Easy to secure cargo safely. would recommend it to anyone.
B00515NG9G|5|Great plugs for Subaru flat 4.
B0022ZXO40|4|works as expected
B007CVSE30|5|I moved 900 miles this summer. Most of the trip was at speeds of 75 mph+. The cargo net was well worth the investment. It kept all the boxes in my truck in place even though they were piled as high as the cab.
B000P17NXQ|5|Put in a Trailblazer to tow two axle trailer. Instructions were good and TB's are pre wired for this. Convenient lever on bottom allows you to test trailer brakes. Display shows what's going on.
B000CRVE88|5|Worked perfectly in my vintage VW style master cylinder.
B001DRP9XC|5|perfect!!!
B000LC87V6|5|Good quality product. Great price.
B000GU3KHO|2|The sizing is TERRIBLE on this product. If you think you know what size you need I suggest ordering 2 sizes above. I purchased the XL and it is a VERY snug fit for bikes over 1000cc. I don't have a windshield or fairings or saddlebags either. The cover itself should NOT be listed as &#34;All-Season.&#34; The material is very thin and I highly doubt it will even last the 2 year warranty it comes with from the factory. If you live in an environment where it is sunny 365 days a year this might be the cover to choose. Or if you want to use this as a dust cover in your garage kept motorcycle. In short, you get what you pay for with this cover. I'll be returning to the Guardian cover I had prior to this purchase as it lasted 7 years.
B00UU23JOW|5|fits our 2009 Honda Civic perfectly.
B00UCWS012|1|Blue light isn't really blue. Once lit it's a green/white.  Nice click but awful make
B00JIEX722|4|One keeps going out, But it's such a tight location I can't tell if it's the bulb or wiring, but when they are li, they look really good.
B00NY0S2OY|5|Bought to cover my bike in the garage. Mainly its just to keep dust off it, it replaced an old sheet, haha. I don't know how good it would be for outside, but for the price, its worth a shot. Fights nicely over my bike (GSXR 1000 sport bike).
B0148VWXKQ|4|Good price
B00TI6V718|3|look good and good price not use yet
B0041RD73K|5|A++ thanks
B001AVQONU|5|Exactly what I needed for my Honda 350X
B009EQDOY0|5|I tried using this Gloss It Leather polish on my GT3 as well as my 15 year old audi TT. Simply amazing. Ill let the pics do the talking
B005EO53UE|5|I bought it for a 1971 Chevrolet Camaro. I cross my fingers that it will work and yes.  it works perfectly.
B0016IT3ZI|5|Perfect!
B00RD4D9AO|5|Packaged well. Easy to install. Top Quality!
B0091YV1F4|4|Used 1for my trunk & 2 for my license lights. May be illegal.
B0009N30EQ|3|Serves its purpose yet cheaply made
B000CQBH8Q|4|Good price. I needed an extension piece to reach the muffler though. May work if you weren't using an aftermarket muffler. I think mine may have been shorter (Thrush Welded Muffler). Also the end of the pipe could've been a little higher it hangs rather low for my preferences.
B000BYGDU6|5|popped it right on and saw an immediate improvement in my engine turnover and idling.
B00TZ5Y67O|5|No complaints, they work as expected.  Make sure these work for your dimensions , with the bases they are slightly larger than I expected but worked fine as taillights on my trailer.  Wiring is as follows white = ground, red = stop/turn (bright), black = running light (dim)
B00700G11K|5|Great fit,  love the screws as they always fit securely with password.  Need some for honda accord now!
B000C5DL3Q|5|Official Ford replacement. Great fit and quality on my 2011 Mustang. My old filter was the same one from the factory and it was filthy with dirt, bugs, hair and I'm sure some other nasty pollution. YouTube videos are there to guide you through the easy install.
B0006FK7YS|5|Best mop.very strong stick. I would recommend everyone.
B008AGKTIO|4|Fits great and feel is very comfortable!! Air flow inside the helmet is great for when it's hot out! And closing all vents when it's cold really helps keep out the cold air! I really like this helmet! Only thing bad is seems a little lightweight and maybe not as safe for road riding all the time.
B00B5OB7O8|5|The led strip is waterproof not the positive n negative wires , they are not so bright but noticeable. They lasted over a year so far , in the picture there are two strips on each end
B0009XT7NY|5|It works. It holds all sizes of cans nicely, even the small oil cans. It doesn't leak, and seems pretty sturdy. I would definitely recommend this to someone else.
B001AXGT7O|4|Arrived quickly.  Not problems with installation.
B001D93D5Q|5|These bulbs rival my 2014 Honda headlights on my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee.
B00B9FCQ1Q|1|does not fit the b7 S4 models...
B00EZW8FD8|3|Really wasn't to pleased with them . I thought they would have been leather  instead of plastic
B00ERXG4TM|5|This thing is freaking awesome. You have to play with the tension a little bit to get it tight enough to hold the throttle but light enough so you can ease the throttle down when you want to slow down. I noticed after awhile the throttle would very slowly ease up so a quarter turn on the adjusting screw fixed that.  Wish I'd had this year's ago.
B00BCRM9RM|5|Great fit. Made the car look brand new.
B002FUO3ZG|2|I'm not satisfied with this product for some reason. The tube wasn't even shiny as expected, also was very thin and cheap. Also it doesn't make any difference in hp or sound.... I just wasted money on this and also on an install. Beyond Frustrated.
B002UMC1HQ|4|Seems to be effective
B000CF6I6I|5|Fit perfectly. Easy to install. Give the glue more than 24 hours to seal but it will seal.
B00KTJ7IGQ|5|Perfect. Just what I wanted/needed!
B0000AY3SX|5|I bought this to remove wax odd textured plastic trim. It works very well. I just use a soft brush and it comes right off.
B003BZD08U|3|Works as advertised
B010K8XPTE|5|Got them and I love them got here in 5 days
B009HQ8ACS|4|Easy to install and seems to be effective
B004HZREI0|5|Best thing ever the dog gets it ...........
B00LIAOUU2|5|Very very nice and blue definitely worth that price they are still extremely bright
B00GSAUHB8|4|Does the job. I like that it's lightweight and folds up. Also comes with a small pouch to store it in. Only complaint is that it's a hair small for my car but works. I drive a BMW X5.
B0042KMX18|5|Great product. Used to use Meguiars Quick Detailer but started using this after getting a free gallon from the Griots Garage flagship store - been sold on it ever since and use it on the Ford F150 and BMW 328i
B00WIMU0CQ|5|The stickers look great, easy to apply and match the color of the rim tape I already had on the wheels
B00TDDCGNO|5|I ordered the Warm color for my truck camper,  1003 was the bulb in there stock.  I replaced all 8 interior and one exterior.  These bulbs are a huge reduction in amp draw and they are NOT bright white or blinding - just like a regular bulb from regular human eye perspective.  There is no reason not to buy these - they all worked and fit perfect,  are a normal interior color,  and won't drain my battery bank.  The price is freaking awesome also - I paid about $20.
B0085CQI10|1|Have owned 4 pairs of HD Blue Blocker sun glasses___all 4 frames broke.  Very brittle.  Don't have to manhandle or traumatize these glass, the frames will break eventually from merely placing or removing them.  AND I'm a professional who works with my hands on very delicate subjects. Not sure if the frames weaken over time or if they have an inherent structural defect.  Ironically, I love the lenses, too bad they don't make a metal or a more durable frame
B00UYYO3CS|3|This product did not fit my jeep arm rest. Had to return. Not too great of quality either.
B009FUFCDQ|3|Good deal and product is just microfiber.... size is smaller than I expected.
B001KOD2EQ|4|I think this is a great replacement shield for someone looking for more tint on those glaring days. Though for something that takes a lot of &#34;beating&#34; from bugs and the occasional rock chip, the mirror finish is more fragile than expected. All in all great shield.
B000JD39WO|4|Not as well made as Weather Tech visors but still nice.  Couldn't find the Weather Techs for our CR-V so I went with these.  A bit on the thin side (I had one of these crack on my Altima) but hopefully they've gotten better.  Happy so far.
B00WZA1A1Q|4|Slight issue with the clutch-side lever on my 03 R1. The bushing on the factory lever has a smaller inside diameter than the diameter of the bushing on the new lever, leaving the mounting bolt with too much play. Had to take the new lever to a shop and have them press the new bushing out and then my old bushing slid right into it. Moderate pain in the neck. There is no issue with the lever itself fitting, just the wrong size bushing for my bike.
B00QPOH210|5|First off. Easy bolt on. Built great! Sounds good .Not loud, but deep. My 6.4 Hemi finally sounds like a hemi. Its quiet in the truck and at highway speeds. Looks great. Oh yeah, went from 15.2 mpg to 16.7mpg, bonus!
B002D3KR4Q|4|Easy to install, great instructions. Definitely clean your bumper with the alcohol swabs provider. However..I wish it extended a little wider.
B007ZGBLNW|5|This baby throws out some serious light! I put it on my lawn mower, and was amazed at how well it works for the price! I just hope it's up to the vibration.
B006LJ20BG|4|Great
B00CMR79H6|5|Love love love. Protects my cargo area 100%. And it looks great!!!
B00EQ2X6GI|5|love these second pair tho someone stole one of mine bastards
B0040D2QC8|5|Worked just as I hoped.
B000VVYTM8|5|it was exactly what I was looking for.it arrived fast.it also worked great.
B002XM5G70|5|sweet little pump ultra<br /> quite good water<br />good price happy with purches
B000C7LIU2|1|I received not what I ordered and what paid the money. I got some piston rings set unboxed, without labeling and 8 cylinder engine. On my 6 cylinder engine they fit. Money and time wasted
B0013REXSO|5|LOVE! Great buy!
B000EDUUG2|4|A little irritating when you don't tighten enough but it is a space saver
B003RVYL4A|5|awesome
B00QFSJKQG|5|I love it .. Looks amazing in my truck
B0009I4U1S|5|Good buy easy install
B000276B2C|5|Perfects fit.
B00BUFWL0Q|5|Worked great with some polish. Hand polishing is not fun but sometimes it is the only option.
B0070IA2JE|5|This sway bar fit with zero issues! My Legacy Gt feels awesome! I recommend buying Whiteline's sway bar end links to go with this sway bar. You can't go wrong with their products. High quality stuff! Im buying everything they make for my car.
B001P2B862|5|Just got done installing these 2&#34; add a leafs and I could not be happier with them. There good quailty and were easy to install. Took about 1.5-2 hours to put in. I added these and two inch strut spacers. The end result was a perfect 2 inches front and rear on a 2011 Silverado. Ride is so close to stock you would be hard pressed to notice a difference. Would definitely buy them again.
B00IUWLZMW|5|Working good.. Perfect fit for my Suzuki Marauder '98 model
B00797O4DQ|5|Perfect!
B00W8ADB1K|5|exactly as described and pictures.
B000TQ15E0|4|Very clever gadget. Provides test functionality that nobody needed until this arrived. Now ever toolbox needs one or two.
B00EDFM83A|5|They are great!
B00JK6QLIU|1|Fits poorly and is not identical to the inner backing of the 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse key fob. I decided to repair my damaged OEM case rather than use this one.
B000EQ0O7O|5|Nice and quiet. Clean, no brake dust.
B00T36WZFU|5|Fit just fine!
B000CQ6G5K|1|Not same metal thickness .. or gasket ?  Leaks .. my old ugly one never leaked ..
B006EFZQJ0|1|I own a 1980 El Camino I'm trying to get my interior lights to work I thought I would replace the door switches hear the door switch is listed for it do not work the thread pattern does not match up future buyers watch out
B001AVC8QM|5|good quality.
B002OWCLNQ|5|EASY TO INSTALL  AND  WORKS WELL.
B00LHT3G54|5|The Youtube video on how to use this replacement leather ($12) was spot on. I am very satisfied. I used a can of 3M adhesive (approx. $11 at A.C. Moore) and a few binder clips to hold the leather in place while it dried. This is one of my best DIY projects.  The Honda dealership told me it would cost $120. The product arrived about 2 weeks earlier than expected. It was exactly what I needed, fit perfectly with a couple cuts.
B00157TGXY|5|So easy to use and so effective. We use these every camping trip in our RV.
B00DCRGWHS|5|Love GoBadges products! Easy to install and looks great!<br /><br />Installed on a 2014 Countryman S.
B00PM34RFE|5|The part was what I needed. It serves it purpose as it keeps my power trunk pull down function.  It is nice to still find GM parts that are still needed for older model  GM cars. Replacement was easy as well. I recall when I realized this part was keeping my trunk pull down feature from working properly. It is hard to believe it has that much of an impact.  I was thankful to locate the part and learn it is shared with other GM models as well.
B0084UJHNO|5|Good product. Looks good on truck. Front installation was easy. The rears took much longer.
B001A0F88I|5|Sturdy and easy to install. I do not notice any rattling as indicated by other reviewers.
B000HJDI3U|5|I HAVE NO SILLS ON MY WINDOWS SO THESE ALLOWED ME TO USE THE LIGHTS IN PLACES I COULDN'T BEFORE.  THEY WILL STAY STUCK FOR THE CHRISTMAS SEASON BUT PROBABLY NOT FOR CONTINUAL USE.  EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I IT THEM WITH THE BLINDS AND KNOCK ONE OFF MY CANDLES HAVE BEEN FINE BUT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM IF YOURS ARE EXPENSIVE.
B000IPV3MG|5|Good stuff
B00E3BQRBI|5|They're bright and look bad ass! Perfect touch for my custom bobber
B00AX4TW98|3|Not as good as they think it is.
B00PRZBGX8|5|Very easy to install and awesome for me since I have a bad back the heat is perfect especially when I have to make long commutes.
B00C5RB03W|5|It arrived quick and is all that  I expected.
B0031B7WD8|4|The purpose of this small compressor is for an emergency or occasional supply of air for motorcycles, bicycles, etc. A piece of paper included in the package explicitly states not to use it for car or truck tires. It's not designed to run for long periods, or be used a lot. Its purpose is to be there when you need it, and hopefully you don't. If you use this frequently I doubt it will work for long, but that is just an educated guess. I deflated the front tire of my motorcycle and it filled it from fully empty to 36 PSI in about 3 and a half minutes. That's your typical sportbike size 17 inch wheel. Now that I know it works I put it in my bike's trunk and hopefully will never need to unzip the pouch again.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Compact<br />Lightweight<br />Comes complete with protective carry pouch and a variety of powering connection options<br />Power cord is about as a long as a motorcycle so you can reach either end.<br />Has an LED on top to assist you with connecting to the tire at night.<br />Has a yellow pushbotton to turn the compressor on and off.<br />The female connector that screws onto your tire's fill valve has a threaded metal insert.<br />Its not loud.<br />Relative to its tiny size it inflated my tire pretty quickly.<br /><br />CONS:<br />The gauge is useless or soon will be. On each stroke of the compressor it jumps 10-15PSI and then returns to the tire air pressure reading. So when you run the compressor the needle is a blur like a fan blade. When I first connected it to my tire it read 36 PSI, the correct pressure. After one cycle of deflating and inflating using the little compressor, which must be thousands of cycles of shaking the gauge needle around, the needle showed 6 LBS low with the pump off.  If you are familiar with air tools and supply you will recognize they failed to place an aperture between the gauge and supply, or else didn't execute it properly. Rather than modify the pump to protect the gauge I'm just carrying my own. Don't rely on this gauge to tell you what the real tire pressure is.<br /><br />Overall a nearly perfect design for an emergency air pump.a nearly perfect design for an emergency air pump.
B00NTPRGNM|5|Works like described what else can you say.
B00540GOMY|5|Love the functionality this adds to our prius.
B000C7W1Z8|5|Fit like a glove drivers side tank 86 K10 w/ dual tanks.
B0059IWK4W|5|The fender eliminator was easy to install and fit my 2009 Yamaha R6 perfectly. Very pleased.
B00U2AECAM|2|This is not the right size for the Infiniti fx35, if you are looking the filter for it don't buy it even Amazon s system tells you it fits your car , it does not! I took some pictures to show you the difference. The filter itself is well made though and it does fit 08 Acura RDX .
B00FP9B9LK|5|Works great.  Works so well i have to unplug it after a couple of days to keep it from over charging.
B00KZIF4NK|4|Bought these in Jan 2014 for my WK1 Jeep SRT-8.<br /><br />Best modification ever.  You can sound just like stock or open them up and have an instant race car.  Loud, scary, and awesome.  Takes about 7 seconds of holding the button to go from fully closed to fully open (or vice versa).  Get the remote control.<br /><br />Way better option than a &#34;performance exhaust system&#34; that is loud all the time and gets annoying and attracts cops.<br /><br />Love them but they are a maintence item and require replacement.  I've replaced one motor 9 months ago and screws fell out of the valve of the other around the same time so it rattles a bit.  Now the other motor has failed so it's time to buy again.<br /><br />The car they are on is a daily and I open and close the cutouts at least 3 times a day.  So they have about a thousand cycle lifespan.
B00CTE4WM2|5|Great product and hubby said it was easy to install!
B00H36XX6C|4|The NOCO XGrid XGB3L is a flashlight that also has a 1.0A charging port. The potential to solar charge is what piques my interest most, but this one does not include the pricey solar charging panels and instead uses the included charging cord (or you can buy the solar charging panels separately). Solar charging would make this a true emergency flashlight-charger for events like earthquakes, power outages, etc. Otherwise, this really amounts to nothing more than a compact, excellent flashlight with a mediocre 3000 mAh power bank.<br /><br />My NOCO arrived partially charged and I plugged it in until the light changed from red to green (after about 2 hours). This NOCO is a winner as a flashlight. It's compact and lightweight, so it's easy to carry in a pocket or bag. The high output LED light gives excellent illumination for such a small device, and it has different settings for luminosity of 100%, 50% and 10% (which conserve energy) and even has a flashing strobe light. Once fully charged, the flashlight has a one year standby mode, so it's a good flashlight to charge up and just carry with you or leave in the car. The NOCO is comfortable to hold and its rubbery outside provides a good grip. While I can use my iPhone as a flashlight, this NOCO is superior as to grip and the lighting provided. It's an excellent compact flashlight.<br /><br />As a charger, this NOCO is average at best. With a full charge, I charged by iPad Mini, and it only charged from 57% to 75% (and took about 1.5 hours) before NOCO was fully drained.  Plus, its only a 3000 mAh charger with a 1.0A port. The charging ability is really no better than those little lipstick chargers and I view it as just a mediocre bonus feature to the flashlight. Other chargers in this price range have superior specs such as at least 5000 mAh and a 2.1A port (faster for charging tablets).  The booklet says NOCO should charge a tablet 50%, but my iPad mini fell short at charging less than 25%. I haven't charged my iPhone 6 yet, but based on how  iPad mini charged and the specs, I anticipate NOCO will charge my iPhone once. I own another charger with a light that outperforms this NOCO in terms of charging capability, but the flashlight doesn't come close. This NOCO has an awesome flashlight, but its ability to charge phones and other devices is mediocre at best.<br /><br />If you want an excellent flashlight that's rugged and compact, then this NOCO fits the bill. I view it as having the added bonus of a basic charger that may come in handy to charge your phone in a pinch. But if you mainly need a power bank, I would recommend a power bank with at least 5000 mAh and a 2.01A port to provide more efficient and effective charging of your tablet and/or phone. In my opinion, this NOCO is a 5 star compact flashlight with a 3 star charger at most, so I'm giving it 4 stars. The flashlight is handy and surpasses my expectations, but unfortunately this NOCO does not replace my need to carry another power bank everyday.n how  iPad mini charged and the specs, I anticipate NOCO will charge my iPhone once.

B00VNBDOV2|5|Easy to install, just as replacing the original bulbs. These bulbs are as bright as HID without the blue tint
B00Q1F5VPW|5|Easy to install, great price also
B00JW1WCNQ|5|Awesome fit no hassle installation.
B00N99OAWI|2|Keys work starting the vehicle. But work when they want too on arming and disarming the alarm system.
B003025J8I|4|Had to find new screws. The screws that came with it were very cheap and stripped when you tried to tighten them at all. Other than that, they are good quality!
B004HMBK5G|5|just what I needed to keep my seatbelt off my neck
B008ZDYLC2|5|Love it, saved me money from what the dealer wants to charge you to tell you what the code means has almost paid for itself
B003S84WL4|5|worked great and save me big bucks!!!!
B00K36BUGO|5|Shipping: One word, Fast! I ordered it on a Wednesday afternoon & had it Friday afternoon.<br /><br />Packaging: The exhaust came packed well with multiple layers of bubble wrap. It also came with clear instructions with color pictures for reference. The M4 exhaust was in pristine condition.<br /><br />Installation: Installation took about an hour. After you cut your stock exhaust off, you will need to grind down the area where the new pipe will go a little at a time until the M4 pipe will slide on. I used some [[ASIN:B0002UEOPA Permatex 81878  Ultra Copper Maximum Temperature RTV Silicone Gasket Maker, 3 oz. Tube]] at the connection point to ensure a good seal with no leaks. I let it set up about 30 mins before running the bike again & I can happily say that I have no air leaks.<br /><br />Product: The M4 Carbon Slip-On adds to the already great looks of the FZ-09. I ran with the stock exhaust for 5000 miles and the M4 sound is quite a drastic change. You do quite literally, unleash the beast! That triple comes alive & it sounds amazing!<br /><br />Overall: This is the best value slip-on exhaust you can get for the FZ-09 & is half the price of the full exhaust systems out there. If you don't mind a little DIY & have the necessary cutting tools...just buy the M4 exhaust already! In my opinion, those who don't like louder exhaust or drawing a little extra attention to yourself, it's probably best to stick with the stock pipe.<br /><br />I hope this is helpful. Take care.

B00BGJ0KEU|3|lasted approx. 6 months before it closed up at the inlet nozzle and stopped working!
B00KSY3HFS|5|Easy to use and fold away
B00IJYII2G|1|The product I received was TOO big for my Harley. It is about 1/2&#34; too tall, it does Not allow my foot pad to raise or fold up when not in use. I installed it and I found these errors. I am not sure what should be done now, except see if I can find the Correct one with the Correct measurements.
B00F7NEREU|4|vfj k
B002ELJZZE|5|1/2 hour installation doesn't take into account the removal of an existing receiver!  That is potentially an additional 2-24 hour project involving impact wrenches, drills, sawzalls and PB blaster!  Actual installation time for the new receiver was about 45 minutes.  Note that if you have another person to help hold it up, the installation could probably only take 15-20 minutes.  Great product though!
B0046VUA0O|5|buen producto
B00D9C2CDO|5|Excellent cargo bag. My challenge was standing on a ladder so I could reach the top of my Ford Explorer, other than that this is an excellent well made cargo bag.
B00WT8YLC4|5|Good quality
B0096R08W8|5|A+
B00GHT6SF4|5|Very nice product.  Well packaged.  Excellent instructions.  High quality replacement...probably then oem.  Highly recommended.
B004J38I62|5|East to use, if you know what you are doing.
B00GSAUHB8|3|From the pictures I though it would be more snug on the windshield than it is in my car (Mitz Galant) which isn't a &#34;small car.&#34;  It works and is compact when you take it down so it fits right between your seat and center console.
B003BZCZZE|4|Excellent
B000765DAE|5|Amazon's price was the best (lowest) I could find on this CURT Receiver.  This is a heavy duty Class III trailer hitch.  It comes with all the hardware needed to install.  It fits perfect, but takes two people to manuever it into place as its pretty heavy.  I fits very tight against the frame and must be raised into position carefully, first thought it might not fit, but because it is a tight fit, you have to lift in parrallel w the vehicle.  You remove the 4 bumper bolts and the large hook first, then lift the hitch into place and install the bolts and washers that come with the unit.  You cannot replace the hook after the hitch is installed.  Very heavy duty and solid construction.  Save a bunch on having someone else intall.
B007NGB2QU|5|Live the look and the quality.  Very happy with my purchase
B009AVX124|1|Noisy Sway bar link. I had to buy new ones.
B0042PCD4A|5|good price
B00X8BKVSY|5|Good to be able to find/buy ANYTHING connected with the Confederacy these days. Went on my car window.
B004UBZ9XI|5|Fantastic lights good price
B00Y5F8VDE|2|I bought these off ebay (same seller and product) and I have to say they are junk. They are of decent weight and the chrome is alright, but the colored inset flaked off within one year and I removed them because it looked terrible. Also they are a real pain to remove- be super careful or you will damage the cars finish. Best to stick with OEM badging, while they are more expensive, the quality is much higher.
B00PLIYNYK|4|I wish they were a little bit brighter, but they're still pretty bright. They light up everything, even signs, so I can't complain.
B002N5W8Q4|2|batteries fit too tight and couldn't get it to work after replaced the batteries the first time
B001DCJ42E|5|If your hinges have stop holding your trunk up I recommend these. They hold so well and will find it very different from the originals.
B009DJVBUW|5|fit right on, much less expensive than dealer part
B0047DIK5I|5|not the problem
B00C0SNKOI|5|Keeps my winch looking like new (I do us it). No complaints here. It's got a nice draw string and clip that cinches up well and keeps it on at high speeds. Not like my Jeep can go very fast.
B0009V1WS4|5|Very easy to use and offers peace of mind for security.
B00806GLBS|5|Great price, Great delivery speed, and just as described.<br /><br />Still does not block sunlight, but that's more of a Mazda design issue.
B000AP1MRA|5|Perfect fit!  Noticeable power increase over the stock paper air filter.
B0002MA9WA|5|Great Thank you.
B00M7E3JBO|5|I see people in my rear view mirror at stop lights all the time taking a picture of my number sticker & am constantly commented to at gas stations about how great it is!
B00GSAUHB8|5|I have an SUV and this sun shield works perfectly at keeping my interior cool as well as keeping my steering wheel from burning my hands off in this southern heat!
B000C9POFK|2|Only made it a year and a half. Now its squeaking like mad. guess ill try another brand this time.
B001GJZ0WW|5|just as expected, fits perfectly on my 20k reese hitch. thanx
B009AQS5H0|5|Looks AWESOME!
B00144B32A|5|I use this as a daily cleaner, but it was originally purchased to get dried mud off of my vinyl roll cage wraps on my Wrangler. Works perfectly! The mud came right off. It's a very strong cleaner. I dilute it the same as I would Pine Sol. About a quarter cup of cleaner to a gallon of water.
B0051I9IYK|5|Items were exactly as expected and shipping was very quick! Will order again! Thank u!
B00VR79KBA|3|It only fits in the dome light for the 2014 jeep wrangler
B000CPIH1C|3|If you cant bolt this in, it is worthless. The glue doesnt hold and the mirror just falls off too easily. I do not recommend based on the extreme effort needed to attach this mirror. oh and you only have 30 days to return it...my fell off again 2 days ago...3 days past the return date :(
B00KGID5YY|4|Works great..
B003YCA64Q|2|was not impressed
B00T0TYXGY|5|Arrived  sooner then I  expected!  Love it :)
B0013FW1OY|4|It's perfect. Great!!  Took awhile to get in the mail.
B001OMVCIC|5|They have done their job! Very nice system. I did a youtube review as well.<br /><br />https://youtu.be/UIDspPH4Aug
B007HRJNIE|5|Easy installation, minimizes noise.
B00OSVGZHY|5|Love it prefect and easy to install.
B00S4UIY3I|5|It works
B00CTAXC90|5|Best k29 scent, smell stays for months and could be placed in many places
B00BJNTU8U|5|Came to me in the allotted time frame...works perfectly. (Several sellers have this item confused with the Throttle Position Sensor...they are NOT the same.)
B000HBNVSK|5|excellent!!
B00009PGNR|5|Wonderful product
B008OE3MWM|4|Half the price of any synthetic 15-40 I could find locally.
B000JUZJUM|5|No reason to run a points system any longer when you can upgrade with one of these. Installation was a snap requiring few tools. I've been using these for years & would highly recommend. Every things under the cap so it doesn't look &#34;add on&#34;. Faster starts & stronger spark!
B00C6MWVKW|5|got it installed same day I received it.. everything is working perfectly
B001EAQTRI|1|Garbage
B00R8N02M8|5|AS EXPECTED
B004Z76BCA|5|Fit perfectly
B002RSIK4G|5|Worked for camper repair
B00YDE2SKO|5|Does what it is supposed to do ... block sun from my child's face. The material seems durable and the suction cups work well on my windows. Warning: When changing lanes, remember you cannot see out of the window as easily.
B000YE8MAC|3|FYI, did not fit my 2010 Mitsubishi Galant even though it said it did, shaft hole is to small for the shaft. Service was good with Customer Service they reversed the return fee charges since I didn't order the wrong part and the description said it would fit my car.  Customer Service had big factor in my rating, other than that I would of rated a ONE star.
B008G371B4|5|Got here on time and looked very nice
B008JGYFAS|5|Awesome and easy install
B00IVW3SA8|2|The top of the item lost its black paint only after a couple months and now has this bronze look to it. Pretty annoying I'll have to get something else.
B005LD2ONC|5|practic!
B005XUYDV4|5|Worked perfect for my 2002 Ford Winstar. Difficulity of changing this on my vehicle is 4/10. Just make sure that your ignition boots are placed in the same order as it was before.
B00HSUFV8G|5|Got this for my husband's birthday.  He is an Air Force veteran who is proud to have served.  This is a great sticker!
B0016IAG18|5|Great!!!
B00VCFIAT0|3|Numbers on end of fuses are not painted, so they are very hard to read.
B00ZJXMG8M|5|Was a very good price and delivered pretty quick! Only thing it states it comes with all plastics but when you order you need to order the 3 plugs that are plastic and cover the 2 mounting bolts and hole were ball is mounted in bumper !
B00FW1JY0Y|3|Definitely brighter than the stock bulbs, No heat produced when unit is one.  Truck light needs to be brighter, I suggest buying a different light for the trunk.
B00YB5GAEA|4|Works great.  Simple to install.  But I noticed that due to the angle of my seat post, it wasn't very visible when attached to the seat post.  It was pointing down too far to be visible to cars.  The light has a slight angle which helps but not enough to compensate the angle of the seat post.  So I attached it to my bike rack instead.  But it is very bright and I feel much safer with it flashing.
B00IMVK08G|4|Works real well. Helps with car headlights a the sun. Very handy, always there
B00G0KRHKK|1|The traditional &#34;tree&#34; air freshers work much better.
B005VYS0EI|4|Did what a clamp is supposed to do.
B00QUL6U8Y|5|works just as stated. I have it paired with the toqure android app. and it works flawlessly. would buy this product again. and great seller and faster shipping then stated.
B003CSPITU|5|Work great, easy to install!  Looks even better!
B006QH55YM|5|These are the best for electric trolling motors. they really take some abuse and never any problems
B00HRFS8SM|5|I have used numerous wheel cleaners including all the name brands - BUT this outperforms them all! Not only does it clean but it also leaves a polished film that makes it a snap to wipe stuff [like break dust] off easier. LOVE it!!
B0018CW8ZO|5|Fit my 2012 Ram 2500 Short Bed like a glove. It was very easy to install and the day after I put it on I drove the truck through a major rainstorm. When I got to my destination and opened the bed the entire thing was bone dry. One thing to watch for, however, is where you locate the 3 rubber bumpers on the 2nd to last panel that supposedly protect the rear window when the cover is folded up vertically. If you mount them where BAK tells you then the panel will still lean with direct contact against the window. Don't mount these bumpers until you see where the panel makes vertical contact with the rear window. Also take the advice of the directions and push down on the side rails while you tighten them up. As mentioned in the install guide, this makes for a better seal and is easiest with two persons.
B0085Y8UMI|5|Yes it works perfect. Thank you
B000BH5MAA|5|Yeah, it cost a pretty penny.  But it works really well on my RV and takes a lot of time off getting set up.  If you have a tire too large you can make a 1 inch thick &#34;tire pad&#34; to raise the tire up a little, and still use this product.  Keep it debris clean and lightly greased and it should last forever.
B009IF1NF4|5|Good og fast
B00MS7ZI8W|5|Best car wax...ever!!!!
B00CJNH8E2|5|Nice! Purchased this for my husband and it is a substantial piece, heavy chrome. It's not hard plastic like another emblem I purchased.
B00DJ5KE9A|5|Instant reading of battery voltage. Easy to connect.
B006WPQNB2|5|works GREAT!
B007JSGR9Y|5|Good tool
B00DSGJ55O|2|Easy to install but doesn't angle correctly to get a real good rear view<br />Functions but there's better ones out there
B00020CB2S|4|Easy to work with. Reduced heat and noise. Would recommend.
B00IACGFOA|4|Worked well and great price
B001DKR3C4|4|Worked great use it on my truck rims would recommend
B0058DIDTY|5|Great quality
B000JFJLP6|4|A very good jump pack.
B0071I3574|5|very good
B009NLMXNO|4|Works great only problem I had was that it was too short so I had to put the switch in a different spot than the existing light panel. Also had to get a new switch
B0024NSWTC|2|The product was shipped in really great boxes, too bad the product was not as perfect. I bought a pair. One is picture perfect and the other was not so. It had an incorrect bulb in one of the sockets, I can live with that but, a half melted day running lens with bubbles was not. I did not discover this until I had spent 3 hours installing it and turning it on for the fist time. The vendor was fast in shipping and it looks like an exact replacement.  My advise is to very carefully inspect them before you start taking your Van apart and get to a point of no return like I did.
B00CT2Y84Q|5|Worked as described.
B000CFAVA2|5|I was in-between the Wade visors and the AVS so I bought both to see which ones I preferred.  And the winner is?  AVS!<br /><br />Reasoning - The main reason I kept the AVS was simply anesthetics.  They look better on the truck. I'm assuming the Wade's would perform better due to the front shades going down to the bottom of the window.<br /><br />Value 5*<br />Looks 5*<br />Installation 5* 20 mins<br />Function 5*
B00JIIZCM6|4|It works great. We used it on our  leather chairs and couch.
B001FCE5AI|4|doesn't remove all the black streeks
B00C5RB03W|5|Nice snug fit and should keep that chipmunk out of my bumper and stinky slinky!
B00FM1CKK0|1|Terrible quality stem was glued in crooked.
B00E1GI9XE|1|They are not green lense glasses. They're regular sunglasses, no green tint. Not at all what I was looking for.
B00KQ81M94|5|Works as good or better than a real shammy.
B000182F0O|4|The shades were all I expected, the price was good and the order arrived on time and securely packaged. I would, however, have only order the rear window pieces if they were available. From time to time, these will get broken for one reason or another. It is both wasteful and expensive to have to buy the whole kit when only one or two need replacing.
B004BGXNGW|5|Have not had a chance to use them a whole, a good thing I guess. They are seem to be built good and the clamps hold tight, have not had a problem yet with them.
B00UHD4HJA|1|There wasn't any sticker that I liked. All of them were product based except for maybe two which were superheroes. I'll maybe keep the Spiderman one but likely give it and the other one to my brother who will appreciate it more. Other than that, every other sticker was about the brand &#34;Vans&#34; or some fast food restaurant. Don't even think there was 50. Waste of money. Do not recommend.
B00XWL75R0|5|Excellent product.  I get so many compliments!!!  Quality made and great customer service!!!
B00063X7LK|5|Great shine!
B000BZJ9Q0|4|Item worked, however was not an exact fit but required modification. Great buy at the price paid.
B0083W16SM|5|worked very well
B00809XRZS|4|Went in  Seems to filter the air.  A lesson in reading what OEM means.
B000CAXTWO|5|hopefully
B00UEMH5L6|1|Did not fit my model
B000CM0X5S|1|Am giving one star for prompt arrival however glass is not to standard and can distort vision. Would of liked the manufacturer to highlight this.
B00B9EULRI|5|Looks great on truck fast shipping.
B00I2Y4FGQ|5|The part worked great, the cars is running awesome. I'm very happy and the price was fantastic.
B00IZLYCEQ|5|love it, Thank you.
B00NT5TXP6|1|I thought this is a hard wheel cover but it ended to be a soft cover (without the shape) and crumbled into a small envelope.  It's not worth the price.
B003ENG3M4|5|This is the real deal - it mounds directly on top of my CR-V.  20 minutes and a few tools, and you can have it mounted.<br /><br />Make sure to tighten down the screws well - if it doesn't seem to ratchet all the way down, remove the screw, blow out the paint dust, and put it back on.
B0009H51PI|5|FRAM is good.
B0073MFWW4|5|Nicely made, prefect welds, bolts right in and fans mount perfectly to it including transmission cooler lines. Great product, just wish you could pick between a 16 lb rad cap and a lower pressure cap, but overall worth it
B004BC9ABS|5|This item arrived in good condition, a perfect match to my old converter, took about 2 hours to change over and took care of all my problems
B007ZLM6LS|4|not a greaseable, but ok
B0006Z9SQQ|4|it does what it says it does. Just doesn't have a nice scent to it. That would have been nice. And there also should have been more wipes in it.
B000FMM6NW|5|work great !
B002UJOE9M|4|Good designs.<br />Surface is shiny laminated finish.<br />Very thin.<br />The price could be cheaper for this material though.
B00B21R0TA|5|Nice projector kit, half the price of the famous brand yet overall quality is excellent and nothing short of it. I did not encounter any fitment issues it just fit like OEM and everyone who saw it think its OEM. The adjustment of the beams however did not come to be as straight as I thought but still I did not have any issues with it. Recommended to everyone especially who is considering to convert their beams to Xenon HID's
B008JYXYNY|3|Works, but one of mine was extremely hard to put on and take off, while the other was easy.
B00445L290|5|Compact,light,and suction is great for its size . attachments are perfect for any car interior.
B00279TAR6|5|This ladder rack was perfect. Exactly what I needed and delivered right to my front door. It is the same as the one I would order straight from Weather Guard directly and I saved money.
B002OKHQSS|4|hard to find item at a reasonable price.
B00J5BQG12|5|Perfect fit. This is the part you are looking for. Cannot argue with the price either.
B002OUQI3W|1|This does not work with all surge protectors! If you have the Progressive Industries PT50C 50 Amp Portable Surge Protector DO NOT PURCHASE this plastic box, it will do you no good.
B0030GIN9G|1|One head bolt. A single bolt. Who in their right minds would think it was ok to charge $20 for a single bolt. Ridiculous. Thieves.
B00029KC0W|4|No problems, ... tough coating used on my lawnmower muffler.
B001T63WXQ|4|Nice have not put on vehicle yet
B0009IK5VC|1|Horrible, after a few days left streaks and didn't last long. Had to change them after a few weeks
B00FYX2BBE|5|Just what I needed.
B012E7JPIY|5|Awesome!  Bright, white light.  Fit my 5th generation Honda Accord well.  Would recommend to anyone with stock fuse light bulbs.
B000C5YD4W|5|works great for my 1999 camry 4cyl (5sfe) california emmisions upstream sensor. be careful to get the right one....  i bought car new in new york and was built in kentucky but was still california emmisions. be sure to check the placcards... california emmisions under the hood and the vin number has a code of where manufactured. wire harness matched perfect even has same colored wires. very easy repair. took 2 minutes. i got a loaner o2 sensor socket from autozone so i didnt have to take the heat shield off to get to the grip part of the sensor. CEL been off 2 months so far. cleared my P0125 and P1135 with P1130 and P0171 pending.
B00NLQH2R4|5|Great looking on my car--looks like it should last.
B00KTITCRU|5|seems to work great
B00RNEX84G|5|good stuff.
B00GC4N2JE|3|bird crap is stronger than super glue and harder to get off
B00ML7IELC|4|I had to return these, they did not fit the socket I wanted to use them in.  {my bad}  But they are bright, good quality lights.  I own quite a few pairs of their lights, same manufacturer, good quality.
B00UC8SJNU|5|Great item for rewire projects and anything to clean up a standard wire clutter! I used these on a boat rewire and was able to make the wire loom junctions look a lot cleaner. I would still advise that you will likely want to use electrical tape or silicone tape in addition.<br /><br />Highly recommended these T Connectors if you are trying to clean up or organize and was impressed with the quality for the price.
B00KFVZ3NS|4|Easy install, no issues.
B002X6VXL4|5|It is nice product.
B00LOX4SNM|5|Great product very accurate to movie decal
B0134PU318|5|Delivery timing was excellent. I am please with the product description 100%.
B000GZL3W8|5|Worked great
B0036IA6JI|5|Fit and functioned perfectly, not a bad price, tells me these must break a lot to have such a complex assembly for $12-$15.
B00W2OSK7C|5|Perfect fit/look. Worth the money.
B0047I5UL0|5|they  look just incredible in my car and it blends well with my momo shifter
B005HPU15M|5|worked fine
B0006MTREC|5|Bought this to use with [[ASIN:B002P3KJME Teknor Apex 828VR-25 AquaDrain 5/8&#34; X 25' Grey Water Hose]] and [[ASIN:B0002F676O Camco 39322 Gray Water Seal Sewer Fitting]] to drain gray water from my camping trailer. Works well with this combination.
B006GJK9NW|4|easy to put on.
B004JO7QYQ|5|Great sign for my new VW
B003AOKCEW|5|Fit like a glove!!
B00OZYHOE2|1|too small for face weird fit.
B009PJJG1Q|5|Measures transmission fluid.  That about sums it up!  It does just what it is supposed to do.  It is not meant to be left in the vehicle, it is just used to verify a proper fill level.<br />The end.
B00KPR9Q30|4|I hadthis regulator on my toyhauler since 2005.  It works great, but the indicator stopped working after a couple years.  I just moved it to another trailer that is lived in 24/7 as I had bought another Marshall Excelsior regulator (different model) that failed in the first few months.  Put this one on and it works like a champ.  I just have to manually feel the propane bottles to see if one has gone empty, but provides good pressure to all propane appliances.
B003QW0PXQ|5|This puller complements the smaller one I have.  It is great to have the additional pull needed for some jobs.
B000P6EERY|1|Item came broken around the top cap. And the plastic line to fill indicator was missing
B00CPGQ1GO|5|Ok. It does what it's supposed to do.
B00WTZVLGQ|5|Thanks!
B004ZF3A94|5|Great product. No issues
B00LNDRN12|3|not much light
B004J0YNYG|5|Fits perfectly! Packaged well, no issues :)
B004IARQ0U|5|good quality....should hold up well
B00062YMJ2|5|Amazing KN product AGAIN.  My 4 cylinder stock 1987 Suzuki Samurai engine with New Weber carburetor has at least 20% more power since putting on this filter.  Gets more airflow! And lifetime warranty and never have to buy a new one.  Original paper filter was reall bad airflow!
B00863MKX8|5|Fits perfect to my car 2005 Chevy Express
B00ZYZOE08|5|Vent fan for my '07 F150 stopped working on speeds 1, 2, and 3. Replaced the blower motor resistor and now it works great.
B00LNOTM0G|5|Went in flawlessly and now I patiently wait for the sun to go down
B0007N3JNU|2|Lasted 7 months. My APC UPS is now beeping once a day for about 45 seconds. The Replace Battery light is on.
B003YLMPPA|5|Worked Great, Will buy from this outfit again. Thank you
B001HSY1SQ|5|I have a 1986 Goldwing 1200 Aspencade I just bought and it looks so much better with this new windshield.  Shipping was way faster than expected, so Kudos to SLIPSTREAMER.  I got a good deal on this old bike, and It looked 30 years old with its scratched up windshield.  With this, it looks 20 years newer.<br /><br />I included before and after pictures of the bike, check out how clear this is!!!!  I couldn't be happier.  Well worth the money and the install only takes about 15 minutes if you know what you're doing.<br /><br />Install instructions<br />Take off the rear view mirrors by removing 2 screws on each one.  Pull forward the outside  (left and right) of the metal fering on the front.  It requires some effort but you should be able to get it one side at a time.  After that you'll figure it out.  Before and After Pics in my messy garage attached.
B000GVC2S6|5|AA+++++
B00635H4JG|5|absolutely love this sticker. ive gotten so many positive reactions to it and to the rest... well I don't particularly care :)
B00XBUK19Q|1|WRONG SET OF STICKERs 😡😡😡
B00JLJUMDG|5|Thank u<br />100% satisfied
B00KPZJQHS|5|Look and work great
B00PQMHHW6|5|we are redoing our trailor and these are the exact same sie thats on it. Highly recommended
B00N3VYMJ8|5|Very good and the delivery was fast
B001DVPDNO|1|Not sure how it was described to fit a 72 Camaro but the good news was it was only about 8 inches too short from side to side.  I was able to use the bolts though, it was a shiny addition to the garbage can
B004WMDXRE|4|Worked. The woman is happy at least.
B000VU57YS|3|Eh...  the matt certainly seems thick enough but its a bit small all the way around.  Since it was cut specifically for sierra/silverado 1500 with regular bed I expected a better fit, it's like an inch short on all sides.  The ironic thing is I bought the Dee Zee tailgate liner and it was huge, way too big.
B000WP38ES|5|not what I expected plus this was overprised
B00QSNZJGI|5|Love these! Gave my Jeep the more aggressive look I was going for at a fraction of the cost!
B00WW4MIPM|5|It fit perfect
B00VYB3JJ8|5|Nice and soft grip
B000C34KUG|5|I was hesitant to buy this belt because I saw reviews saying that it would not fit.  While it took a bit of time to get on, it does fit.  The issue is with Ford making it incredibly difficult to mount belts over their pulleys, not the belt itself.  The belt is silent and works great (I've had it on for about a month now).
B010G2TWCS|5|Excellent product quality and service.
B00U85LFKG|5|Fits great on my 08 GMC Sierra.
B00ZGJYCKO|5|Repainted my 2001 F350 color change. This primer is awesome.
B00MQEIRTO|5|Item was as described
B00L3M1KJY|5|Awesome mx goggles.  Much better than any thing under its price range. Would recommend.
B00UM4BM6U|1|this item torn after a few days in hot weather this is a horrible product would not recommend to anyone. spend your money somewhere else and you'll be happy
B00A1973XW|5|Works better than my old one. My window stopped while cracked and with the heat I had to get it fixed, everywhere I went they were gonna charge me about 200-300 for the job possibly more j was able to do it in an hour it's super simple already assembled just out with the old in with the new. Super smooth and quiet
B00DN3IQFC|5|Perfect color for Cocoa/Dune Chevrolet interior.  Does exactly what it is made to do.  I bought the Husky floor mats too.  This bridges the gap left between the front floor mats if you have the split bench seat.  Everything matches and looks great.  I love it.
B006NTK3MM|4|Good. Cable.
B00D1CQVIY|5|Easy to use
B000FBUOAA|3|I wish these had been a bit better, because the general idea is great. Unfortunately they aren't near as good as they could be. The most 'glaring' problem with them is simply that they look more like little mirrors than labels (red lettering on shiny chrome look). This makes them difficult to see, and kind of stupid in reality. When placed on the top surface of a Snap-On master series roll cab drawer pull (looking down on them) they actually disappear (reflect the color of the above drawer). The magnetic strips also barely hold the labels in place, touch them and they slide about. One more problem is pretty basic (or advanced, depending on your point of view).. there should be more and better named labels to include things like diagnostics, pullers, torque tools, air tools, files, punches, and what have you. I can't say they're terrible though, because some people might like them, they didn't cost much at all, and they are fast, simple, movable, and mess free.<br /><br />However, anybody with serious tool boxes should not consider these for a moment. Personally I'd be happy to pay triple the $6 asking price... if the labels were better, larger, clearer, they stayed put, and there were more of them.
B00BTGSGFK|5|Excellent applicators very easy to use
B008G2B1KM|5|2004 Chevrolet looks new again! Great price, too.
B0009IQZH0|5|Nice towels

B00HQYTUYA|3|Thought it would be larger, but it is adequate.
B0000DYV3N|5|Deer have turned away also rabbits & pheasants. Only a slight noise heard inside van.Would recommend this to anyone frequently in deer areas.
B000C5FJL8|5|excelente

B00LLZFIK0|5|cool product!
B00AETSLEY|5|Seems like a great product.
B004HAEG22|1|Terrible product
B004ME11FS|4|good
B001JT1FJ6|5|Must have you diesel owners.
B00FWOKKGI|5|I like it.
B00171V1SQ|5|I'm not sure why buying wiper blades should be such a pain, but on my car, one blade is a LOT longer than the other, so I have to get them right. These were easy to select and install, so I am grateful.
B0050QIJ0W|5|Honestly, if you're looking for a set of economy hard bags for a smaller sized cruiser, you have a little DIY skill and, you're willing to put in a little work, you really can't go wrong with these bags!<br /><br />As other reviewers have already said, these bags aren't the greatest right out of the box but, a little extra time and money (&#60; $100 total) in improvements, and these bags are absolutely fantastic!  I've received many compliments from co-workers who ride, about how good these look on my Shadow Spirit 750 (some thought they were factory) and, how nice and bright the lights where (that's just one of the things I modded).<br /><br />Detailing exactly what I did, how I did it and, what parts I used, would require a longer write up than what I think Amazon would allow but, below is a summary of the mods I made and, I've attached a few pictures of how some of the parts looked as I was going through the modding process.<br /><br />*Coated interior of bags with two coats each, of rubberized undercoating (1 spray can per bag).<br />*Used silicone gasket/adhesive to make light lens/retaining trim water tight.<br />*Replaced original bulb socket with easy to remove socket.  Light can now be changed from inside bag and without tools. (Dorman Part # 84737)<br />*Replaced original bulb with brighter, cooler running LEDs, bought right here on Amazon. (JDM ASTAR Super Bright AX-2835 Chipsets 1156 1141 1073 7506 LED Bulbs for Brake Lights Tail lights Turn Signal, Brilliant Red)<br />*Replaced original locks. (National Hardware Part # N185.280)<br />*Plugged bottom holes with 3/4&#34; Black Plastic Flush Type Hole Plugs with 1&#34; Head. (You can get these here on Amazon or, at a local Lowes, Home Depot or, auto parts store)<br />*Replaced original door gasket with 3/16&#34; wide x 1/8&#34; thick, self-adhesive weather strip/seal (Home Depot, Lowes, Walmart)<br />*Sealed wire pass-through hole with water tight, rubber oval plug and drilled (undersized) hole for single wire (hot) pass-through. (Auto parts store)<br />*Welded brace between mounting brackets.<br /><br />That's about it.  A few basic hand tools, some elbow grease and in no time, you have a very nice looking and functional pair of hard bags for your ride.  With a little thoughtful packing, you'll be surprised how much you can squeeze into these little gems.wire (hot) pass-through.

B006VU5WX8|5|this thing is a great addition to any do it yourselfer toolbox. anything else is a waste of money  works great if u can lay it on the ground and hit it with a hammer its going to crimp it.
B000UH4Z8G|5|as promised, prompt ship.
B00FY2WEC6|4|decent product, poor clamps
B00KC67CZ8|3|I got the product and started installing it and one of the parts will not fit because the inside grooves are too small to fit the door locks. otherwise they're good.
B00DC3KQR4|4|Good deal for the money but not as bright as I was hoping for.
B0065XY5SY|5|Perfect fit, corrected my door actuator problem, ac works great.  Thanks.
B00CBZAY8U|5|I needed a mini &#34;NAM&#34; for my suit that I'm wearing to my friends 20 year retirement in the Corps.  The mini medal came in quick and looks outstanding.  Thank you MilitaryBest for the card too.
B009OAWUUK|5|Great option when you don't need a heavy jacket or are going low profile. Still has the necessary armor and sometimes you just need to have a hood! Covers far enough I don't end up with a gap between my jacket and jeans. :)
B00MO9T9SE|1|I have used these mirrors twice and they have scratched my mirrors pretty bad, can only imagine what continual use would do. The lower half of the truck mirrors are plastic, so when these &#34;clip on&#34; mirrors slide down to lock in the scratch the truck mirrors. Had I known that, I would have never bought them.
B0006IX87S|5|Product as described. Makes the RV water taste pure and sweet. Easy to install.. I have since discovered, however, that I can buy same thing at Walmart considerably cheaper.
B00AU5YD7G|5|Very nice
B010VUZDC8|5|I love how much light this license plate picks up! Super sparkly, super high quality - what more could you ask for?!
B006ZGKZ9E|5|fit my 08 mazda 3 pretty great! they are a little light but work just fine!
B001INMKP6|4|looks good
B010TG6T1I|5|OKAY
B00LLZFIK0|5|Every member of my family now has one.
B0006SH4GE|5|Make sure you read before going balls to the wall with this. Great cleaner when used correctly.
B002NOK7HC|5|installed insturitions were great and it fit fine  have not pulled the car yet
B000E2B292|5|This is what my scooter uses for transmission oil , great oil
B009FU7RZM|4|Good shock - slightly bouncy then stock.<br />Mounted on a GMC2500HD front.<br />Might buy again at this price
B000CGHR76|5|Perfect fit for 1999 Civic LX.
B005531PGK|4|Good quality but some twisting and bending was needed to bring it straight to PS fitting
B0128SCDJC|4|If you want black headlamp assemblies with easy &#34;plug and play&#34; capabilities, this is what you want. They fit perfectly on my silver 2004 4Runner 4WD 4.7L V8 Limited.  Came with high and low beam (55/65W).  They do not come with the upper, outside ambers or new mounting screws.  Had to take them off my old assemblies.  Also, the lower inside plastic backing for the mounting screws were inoperable on both left and right assemblies.  Again, was easy to salvage a few plastic pieces from the old assemblies I removed.  First headlamp took about an hour.  The second took about 15 minutes.  Was done completely in about 90 minutes.
B000IYWY2K|5|Love the factory replacement parts.
B00BGD956K|5|I like them they work good.
B001U6DMSK|4|My seats are protected.  Only problem is that I could not install the rear seat cover the way I wanted.  I could not get it on the rear seat like the instructions said.  Otherwise they are doing their job.
B002PUTC0M|5|Accurate and easy to use.  High quality tool.
B00OBRC9E8|5|OKAY
B000C9SJUC|5|It fit where the OEM part went perfectly! I put this on my 1999 Oldsmobile 88 after seeing how bad the old gas cap seal had begun to deteriorate.
B00Z0G0TN2|5|I received these lights at a discount  for an honest and fair review. I ordered these for my husband he owns a 2004 jeep, he used them for his interior lightning. They work very well. Fit well and worked. They are clear and bright. Shipping was fast. Communication from the seller to let my order  status be known. And follow ups. Thank you for a quality product!
B00F7S6YSM|3|It  is nothing special, just what you see
B004C46ITM|5|awesome
B009202156|5|Good
B00MWCNPM4|5|wonderful product, would highly recommend this for your shoes with cork soles
B00V2XHSSQ|4|Very good Product!
B001KQD7TY|5|Worked great and came quickly.
B003EOZLEO|5|easiest part ive ever installed, look awesome
B00OXZE4SC|5|Great product, recommend to anyone
B00HUZUUI0|2|Product received doesn't match the picture.  I trusted that it was the same.
B000BRFQKQ|3|ok
B0028NB1SM|2|Not good for lab work, the handles are covering your view
B0009OMYAQ|4|WORKED PERFECTLY TO ACCESS AND REPLACE MY OWN OIL FILTER
B002ESA45M|5|Excellent product, one of the best price/performance downpipe on the market for your subie's. If you are worried about the heavy smell of the fume think twice beacuse the smell is definitely there, due to the downpipe's being catless. I could say it more or less smell like burnt paper mixed with the smell of gasoline but imho it will not bother you if you are a true petrolhead.  I own a 2005 sti which had a custom but poorly built catless downpipe on it and I paired the installation of the downpipe with my N1 catback, so as for the sound I couldn't really tell the difference of the downpipe specifically because the N1 made a positively huge difference on the sound.  As for performance wise you need a remap on the ECU to benefit from the downpipe.  Overall quality,packaging and delivery was both excellent and solid. I think the welds were hand made instead of machine weld.  Recommended for everyone who is looking for a price/performance product, Invidia quality as always.
B0015PMZMU|4|What can I say. It worked. I did 14 flares with only one problem and that was because I didn't tighten the wing nut far enough to keep the line from slipping. When I was all done, there was not one leak. I did 7 factory replacement lines, routing them exactly as they were from the factory.<br />I used the poly-coated 3/16&#34; line. (the dark &#34;green&#34; stuff). My process. I cut the line, I then used a bench grinder to debur the O.D. of the cut off. I used a chamfering tool to do an edge break on the I.D. I then put oil on the included die and then proceeded to create the flare. When done, I then took the flare back to the bench grinder only this time I used a fiber type buffing wheel to remove all the poly coating from the surface of the flared area. I just didn't think that the green stuff, streaked partially through the flared face was a  good idea left there. I did not put any force on the buffing wheel. Just enough to remove the green streaks.<br />I didn't like how the clamping process marred the surface of the non-flared area of the brake line but I don't know how you could hold it without doing so.<br />The only reason I gave it not 5 stars is that it didn't work as nice as the $350 tool does. So there you have it. I would buy it again I think.
B001O80SVS|5|Fit perfectly, and operates flawlessly.  Quiet but powerful.  Be aware that when you install it there are more than one rubber plugs in the casing.  Only remove the one necessary to install the cooling tube that was on the original blower fan.
B00LQHR9GE|5|Perfect for Polaris Ranger 900
B00DNU3MIG|1|Mismatched hardware, the casting is sloppy causing the fixed side of the bolt to spin, it's junk
B000C9QJOK|5|Perfect fit for my 1970 C10, has adapter to fit my older model that makes the end kind of bulky but just zip tie it out of the way under dash. Solved my brake light problem.
B000C9Q134|4|GOOD QUALITY..
B0040CVVDY|5|Thank you
B00FGOTTO8|1|It is my first purchase, NOT a good experience.<br />OPEN COMING SEALED WITH STAPLES AND MISSING PARTS
B000YE8MUW|5|So far so good. No issues. Fits perfect.great price
B001DRP9G4|5|This is it for OEM oil filter for Mercedes. They're the best you can buy. I bought this with the CASTROL synthetic sold here and the engine is even quieter than before.
B00I8WRBNG|5|why pay 500 bucks for one of these.  this thing rocks  I just installed and did a big three upgraded now I have enough power for anything.  well worth the money and its cheaper than the stock alternator from your local parts store.  if you need power buy this
B00IS93BCE|4|I put this bumper on an 87 yj.  The bumper arrived quickly. I've never bought anything off amazon that was packaged so well.  It made me feel good about my purchase, because if someone went to the trouble to put 5 protective layers around their product, well, it shows they care.  Had everything lined up correctly, it would have taken longer to get out of the package than to mount on the jeep.  I had to use a hammer to get the lower mounting tabs where I needed them, that was no big deal.  4 of the 6 bolt holes were ¼&#34; off, just ream them out. I'm sure it would fit just right on a few jeeps, and it was close enough to modify on mine.  The paint is nice and the bumper looks good.  I hoped it would be a bit heavier.  I will reinforce the winch mount with some flat strap on the bottom side so that I don't feel like the bolts are going to pull thru the factory holes.  The only other modification I'll make is opening up the slot on the front so that my winch cable won't rub because it's a smaller opening than my roller fairlead. For a $250 bumper it gets 4 stars.  If you want to buy a bumper that doesn't need modifications then spend a couple hundred extra, or save the money and invest an extra hour mounting this one.
B00Z7KIZPA|3|This product will only hold a very small purse. It does work well to hold my diabetes supply bag.
B00OKWY3PW|5|Fits like a glove and the heavy duty fabric gives the impression that this may be the only seat cover I will ever need, Dog constantly jumps from front to back and this seat cover remains in place without wrinkles or sags. This is the seat cover I've been dreaming of. Buy it now. No thought needed.
B00JXYGSFA|5|So far so good! :) AC works great!
B00VSB80E8|5|I ordered these for my grandmother to use in her car- It's always great, shopping for car related products on Amazon to be able to see if a product is compatible with your model of car. Since Amazon gave me the go for a Chrysler PT Cruiser, I knew I could buy with confidence. My grandparents are highly patriotic people from a military background so I knew they'd love the opportunity to display their patriotism on their car without messy decals or permanently altering the car.<br /><br />While we use self adhesive rear window, passenger, car shades- I liked that these came with suction cups- I knew they would be simplest for my grandma to store and install. The Suction cups can actually be left on the window, and the shades taken down and stored in the convenient (included) carry pouch. These are easy to pop open and twist/fold shut. The colors are vibrant and the material filters UV rays without distorting visibility from the back seat.<br /><br />In regards to what one person referred to as a 'stain' I think this is actually the way the graphic tries to illustrate the movement of the flag image, and a graphical shadowing, not 'staining.'<br /><br />These seem well made, fairly thick, especially at the border stitching and the color saturation is very vibrant. I am curious if they will fade over time. One thing of note is that the material does get pretty warm to the touch when sitting in direct sunlight for several hours. We received a product discount in hopes we would share our honest thoughts, which we have done. We will update the review as necessary throughout continued use over prolonged time.
B000GARO80|5|Had to replace a previous one, that I believe had been there since RV was new 21 years ago.<br />Easy to wire in (But Need square bit for terminal block) Fired up fine.<br />Simple design, hopefully lasts another 20 years...
B003ZUOO9U|5|Arrived before the shipping date. Super easy to install and the bright white light is much better than the dull yellow light from the old bulbs.
B000C936YG|5|Seems to be quality made.. It fit perfectly on my TJ.. Make sure you get their tailpipe too. The factory tail pipe is welded on the muffler..
B005ITWODY|5|Product works great and does not leave a sticky residue like many other similar products.
B00DQQ8PWK|4|Little more coverage needed on both sides where you rest your feet for snow and slush not to dirty the carpet. Otherwise quite happy with the product.  Bought from the factory at Bolingbrook IL and paid 109.99+tax.  Seems it is cheaper to buy from Amazon!
B000RXNLK6|5|Great quick detailer. I sometimes like to use a detailer with a carnuba wax in it but this is an excellent detailer.
B00KWDT1BY|5|A+
B00HZTDKZG|5|Despite it being small, this is actually the BEST of the 5 or 6 chargers/tenders that I own.  Not kidding.  Especially as a tender, this keeps the battery topped-off, but never over-charged.  It dumps any overage.  I check my batteries often and they never heat up on this tender.<br /><br />I have a real workload, and this tender has no problem keeping up with any of it:<br /><br />I have 3 Harley-Davidsons so that means I ride them each only about twice a month.  Even though I'm in Florida and I can do this year-round, I still need battery tenders because the alarm systems drain the batteries on the bikes, and also any kind of lead-acid battery is simply going to drain over time (that's science folks).<br /><br />I can't find any problem with this tender, and it simply works, and works properly.  I have no idea who actually makes it (Yuasa, probably Chinese manufacturer near Guangzhou) but it's very good quality.
B00JMCCE6U|5|The correct product for my new Dodge SRT Challenger Hellcat. And yes the Hellcat hold 6 quarts. This is factory fill from Dodge SRT so good enough for me. I have noticed via oil analysis this product has higher molly levels than others so that is a plus for me. Pennzoil has a warrantee ( you must sigh up for via the website) but can offer a 500,000 mile guarantee.<br />I think the fact that this oil is the 1st oil made from Natural gas tells me the base stock may be cleaner than other choices. I am a huge fan of this product and is the PERFECT 0W-40 for your SRT
B00HESS4M2|4|very good price, works good too .Fast shipping. thanks
B00PGJE40C|5|Good quality and easy to install. Would definitely by this again.
B0042VTYSW|3|It is okay.
B0002HRBSU|4|Good, works
B00KMYYQ36|2|I ordered this product to keep my new patio furniture protected from spills and water (rain).  However, it rained unexpectedly the other night.  When I went out to bring cushions in I discovered that this product did not repel water! (as advertised).  The cushions that I had used Scotch Guard however had protected them from the rain.  The rain had not penetrated their fabric.  I am very disappointed in this product and will not use again.  I will save my money & purchase Scotch Guard in the future.
B00D3298A0|5|Super heavy duty floor mats, much better than the small carpet ones that my 2012 Ford Fusion came with. Did not have a bad rubbery smell right out of the box.
B00Z7KIZPA|3|It was a lot smaller than I expected.  My purse is too big to fit in it. Only a small purse fits in it.
B001GN6SE2|5|Works perfectly. This cord plus the length of the harness on the controller itself gives me lots of mounting options. Connects securely and disconnects easily when I am done.
B00SGCQ3KU|5|super bright , its amazing the power of this little guy
B00880D8YY|4|Very sturdy & works well, but a tad bulky...
B005JWCPUC|5|works for my Subaru
B000QGOPO0|4|Sound just fine, my son says these factory speakers are far over priced, that I should have bought replacement speakers, but did not want any issues regarding installation, so I paid price and installed easily.
B003CGDPVK|1|I love the concept for keeping gear towels, shirts etc... from flying out at higher speeds. I mostly used it to keep my dog safely secure (he is a  basenji who would jump out for a squirrel if given the chance).<br /><br />The reason for one star is that I used it in conjunction with my hardtop which in order to install the hard top again requires you to remove (at least the trim channels where a traditional soft top locks into).<br /><br />Inserting and removing the CRES top just a few times the stitching holding the plastic channels started to break free of the fabric top. After about two months of on and off use the top no longer would hold my dog securely because the plastic channels were completely falling off.<br /><br />For the $99 price tag and given the typical jeep owner demands a &#34;tough&#34; product to go along with their tough jeepin lifestyle this did NOT make the cut.
B0040DX7EO|5|nice package, great item n super fast shipping!!
B005M1R5UA|5|good quality but a bit expensive
B00T2GT9L4|5|Brought it last week and saved me twice in one day. My car battery is below 40% for sure and probably lower. It would just click when I try to turn it on. This thing jump the car in one try. However, I do not fully understand why the green and red light are constantly flashing when they not connected to terminal. The broken english on the black indicator box is very hard to understand. Just keep it in the carrying case and out of direct sunlight in the trunk and you be fine.
B00146A23Y|1|Was much smaller in size than expected
B00CHQV7CU|5|Love it
B00FA5WPFI|5|EASY install. Seems to have arrived fully charged as well. I saw off brand batteries available at ½ the price but decided to go with the name brand. I tried a replacement brand lead acid battery for my Quantum power pack and it never worked again. So I went with the &#34;real&#34; thing for my UPS. Seems a great idea so far. I'm still going to let it run for a day before plugging my equipment back into it. I was borderline overloaded before and being also paranoid about the Quantum snafu I bought a new, higher powered unit as well as this replacement battery for the old unit. Now I will have power to spare. It came USPS so the tracking is not reliable. But it arrived a say ahead of the suggested week long delivery estimate. So good service if you just ignore the tracking estimate.
B00VNBDWPK|5|super. ease to install, looks like solid looking.bright even for semi truck
B006329FF0|5|fits well without tearing up the plastic oil filter cover cap. highly recommended
B000G78YP0|5|It worked great. But I did have to re-drill holes in my trailer since the trailer and this universal layout didn't line up. But it was pretty easy.<br />My trailer is a 2004 Fourwinns 17.5 foot if you are wondering.
B00N9LMXUC|5|This works fine in my 2000 Toyota Tundra truck. I attached a photo of the Majic  JUMBO  Sunshade insert that lists makes and models of the  autos that this product will fit.
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Shipped on time and worth every cent!
B0077T37GQ|1|I should have read the other reviews before I purchased. I ordered this and the wheel balancer setup. They came in the same box and the box was torn open. The bead breaker was very poorly designed in that the flanges to bolt it together did not align together and I had to make adjustments to get it assembled. Will not purchase from this company again.
B000C40RSO|1|Was not even the correct part.  I got a totally different Strut.
B00GB9CGI8|4|Good price look's good
B0018MITR0|5|Yes product was as prescribed and very comfortable and arrived on time
B00BFUFT2S|5|last a while . does not sling
B001TCXOTW|5|A set of gadgets i didnt know i needed until i bought them. if you work on a car with blade fuses invest in one or two swts of these
B00EW44IIK|5|Love the quality and color.  Easy to install.
B0009JKI8G|5|It wipes the windshield with gusto and verve (it does what it is supposed to do).
B00279NGTO|5|Great item and super fast shipping. I returned the item because. My switch was not the issue. But fantastic return service.
B00RMNNAKA|5|Installed it on my Dirt Bike for night riding and it exceeded my expectations, it easily brights up some 300 - 350m. It's a real Spot Beam, at about 50m the light is no bigger than 2m in diameter, so no good for closer distances, really effective after about 100-150m. Will buy more of these and even the Light Bars, thinking of a 20&#34; right now!!
B0002JN3GC|4|Ok
B00FBP5FWM|5|This is exactly what I was looking.
B0002MAANI|5|Great product, did exactly what I needed to do :-)
B00MOE2LKM|3|I have a 2015 Honda Civic. This is ok. It doesn't come out far enough so it's not the most supportive for someone with neck issues.
B001C5Y4FE|3|suppose to be better with then the non vibration - I dont see it, seems to be the same<br />Unit works but probbally not worth the extra money
B00J0IKPIU|5|Very easy to install! Super easy to set up and works great!<br />Super fast shipping and A+ communication<br />Will be installing them on all of my cars
B000VB1DOU|2|Squeaking like crazy smh As we speak listen!!!
B0052XLXB0|3|good price, quality standard
B007ILANWY|5|Does what a gas grill should. The feet make it great for camping on land, and the rail mount keeps it secure on my boat. No complaints.
B0018GSVG0|5|Sounds great on 86 K10 with a 350. Paint does come of almost immediately, but I definitely don't have a show truck.
B00AYAICW4|5|Need to buymore
B0055AZDAC|3|Does not fit 2004- XJ
B001C6N7M4|1|second one that i have purchased. chrome cover poped of on both first drive down the road. NOT HAPPY
B00EPDLSMM|5|I was definitely concerned the hitch cover would be cheap or rust within a few weeks, but such is not the case.  The cover is very durable, heavy metal, and hasn't rusted at all.  We owned it for about a month now with no issues and continues to look great.
B00PST7BAA|5|Great finish, arrived timely. Exactly what I was looking, great product.
B000HULKZC|5|Everything you need to get rid of oil in the spark plug wells
B00RLUIMHK|1|Pads lasted less then 5000 miles in my 2013 F350  I am an ASE Master Tech BTW
B00EC4H9YA|1|Would this fit my 2015 lancer?
B00173U7D4|5|This stuff works wonderfully! I really don't like any of the other air fresheners we've used in our bathroom. Most of them just add a fake flowery scent on top of the odors you'd expect in the bathroom. This one has a very natural scent to it and really does a great job of removing the odor!
B0002SREPY|5|As expected however have not used yet. Looks to be well built.
B002389W7E|5|Really gets the crud off and smells wonderful!
B000EDOSKG|1|I had ordered this product because I have no outside faucet. My sink faucet has no threading. This product states you can use it on any unthreaded or broken faucet. It does NOT work! within 5 seconds of turning on the water the entire piece pops off the faucet and water is sprayed everywhere. it needs some kind of fastening mechanism to keep in on the faucet. It states on the package that you cannot use it for any pressurized hose nozzle, well there wasn't any pressure at all and it still didn't stay attached! thanks to amazon for a full refund. Do not buy this!
B00GZ054X2|5|Great buy!
B00OM60DH8|5|easy to install and highly functional.  no drawbacks.
B00379ABX2|5|To big..
B000GX9FSY|5|Bought for my E46 BMW, replaced OEM perfectly.
B008A5GRHM|5|Best product I have ever bought in my life. I recommend this to everyone I know. I used this on the plastic panels on my 2004 avalanche and they look like new. It has been a few month sense I put it on and it has not faded.
B008Q9X4EQ|5|Solid product,prompt service!  Good value!
B0002MB92Y|4|Works
B000JFJM14|5|Works great for doing topside oil changes.  No more crawling under a car and removing the plug- and risking ruining the threads in an aluminum oil pan.  My only warning to future purchasers is to not leave used synthetic oil in it for long term storage, the oil will seep past the seal in the pump and you'll get no suction and or ruin the pump seals.  Just make sure to empty it out shortly after use into jugs to whatever.
B004R35M8Q|4|1st the delivery was awesome, received the unit on 8/23.  But I didn't receive a &#34;Draw-Tite&#34; as ordered, someone substituted a &#34;Pro Model&#34; in place.<br />This hitch was heavier than the 30#  advertised Draw-Tite Receiver.  It did fit the 2015 Terrain Denali perfectly, so I guess I can't complain too much.<br />Further note, this hitch does require two people to install, 18mm and 3/4 SAE sockets and extensions.  Start the bolts and taps with a 3/8&#34; sockets and squeak the final turns with a 1/2&#34; set.  Probable install time was approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour.
B00AZMB8XQ|5|Genuine AC Delco part with new bearing.
B000CN956K|5|Did the job nicely
B00T4TEWBQ|4|{EDITED}  Just to add to my below review.  As I mentioned, the tissue dispenser doesn't work well.  However, I found that if you leave the top zippered part of the tissue compartment open, and use pop-up tissues out of their box and pull them through the top instead of out of dispenser part, it works quite well!  That's not how it's intended to work but it works.  {ORIGINAL REVIEW}  Finally got rid of my old car trash bin because it needed carpet on the floor to get it to stay in place.  Hung Phil on the passenger seat back and can easily drop things in it when driving.  Yes there is an issue with Amazon shipping crushing it, but I gently bent it over and over back into place and it's good to go now.  It's a well thought out product.  Unfortunately it loses 1 star because the tissue dispenser doesn't work well.  For those of us with allergies a good tissue dispenser is indispensable, but the tissues don't come out well and they tear.  I'll go back to a tissue box in the arm rest.  But everything else about this product is very nice.
B00VYNCXCU|2|Package was torn open parts may have been lost there was no studs to mount the struts to the hood I had to buy them seperately.
B00JLJV1NQ|5|The first unit that we received had a flaw in that the 'headlight' mode didn't work. After I notified Amazon of the problem, a second unit was sent out immediately and it works fine. There was a problem and it was taken care of right quick.
B000BQWLE6|2|I can't say anything was wrong with this item, but I thought it was bigger...like a normal trah can.  It is the size of a coffee can.  Not too useful to me.  I will keep it because shipping is more than I paid for it, but not sure how I will use it.
B0025TMZ4I|5|PERFECT!
B00INZ65B2|5|This kit fixes the well known GM gauge cluster malfunctions.  The people at Dr. Speedometer, make it easy to order and understand what to do to fix your gauge cluster.
B0009OMYAQ|5|Works perfect for my 2011 Chevy Malibu. Makes changing the oil filter quick and easy.
B006E4HSX8|5|works good, looks good
B00BTGSID0|5|Great towels, actually best ones I ever used. And i have Meguiars mirco fibers and water magnet
B0073MEBQ2|5|Great part so far, quick delivery and free shipping. Whats not to like!
B005345ELS|5|I received it on time, and the product is just like its description.  I was concerned about the fit, but that's not an issue.  It fits fine.  I bought it to use at the gym and it was OK for that.  It might be better if the material was just a little thicker, but that's personal preference.  It should be perfect for under a helmet.
B00NIHOZP8|5|Excellent lights! I use a set of these daily at work. Very bright! Stands up to the rain and the constant vibration from a 185 diesel air compressor which they are mounted to. These are great for fishing as well! Be aware however I have so far ordered two sets and there have been some minor differences between them. The first set had a rough, flat finish, red and black wires, and the lens was concave. The second set had a less rough and glossy finish, blue and brown wires, the lens was convex and the bracket was about a 1/4 of an inch shorter, also the bracket bolts from the second set of lights cause a rusty film to form around the bolt in wet conditions. All of these differences are minor and both sets work flawlessly. Also note that the difference in the lenses do not seem to have any effect on the beam. Overall I would recommend these lights!<br /><br />UPDATE!!! 6/24/16:<br />After using these for about a year I would still HIGHLY recommend them considering their price to performance. I cannot say that they are perfect however. I have attached some pictures of them showing the issues I have with them. To begin with, a few of the photos show the minor differences I spoke about in my initial review. This can be seen by the convex/concave lenses shown in two of the pictures. In one picture you can see where an LED module has stopped working. Since this picture was taken, another module went out on the same light. Out of the four lights this is the only one that has failed in this way but it may only be a matter of time before more of them fail. You will notice that there is some condensation inside some of the lenses. This doesn't seem to affect the light output but may have caused the LED failure mentioned before. Overall these lights have performed amazingly well especially considering their price! I use them nearly daily at work and to still be doing their job very nicely at this point I would say it was money WELL spent. When you consider other lights are $70- $100 a per set and have similar problems these quickly become an amazing value!
B007K8AA7I|3|Want a light that lights up the night better than your stock halogen light?  This is for you.<br />Want a light that makes you be seen by all the idiot drivers our there?  This is NOT for you.<br />I installed this headlight on my 2005 HD Heritage Softail Classic during daylight hours.  This beam really lit up the garage.<br />I then opened the garage door to be knocked over by the brightness of this monster light.  Wait, is it even on?  Oh, yeah, it's on, but it looks dimmer than my stock light.<br />I want a light that makes Me visible.  I don't need to see the road better.  I rarely ride at night.<br />This light was not for me.<br />Easy to install, but as others say, it sticks out further than stock, so you need a larger trim ring to cover the front edge.
B00SI9HFLW|3|The paint was labeled stinger yellow,  not baha yellow.  It did not match.
B00KO6U8CK|5|Great product.  Installed it in my 2013 Honda Civic SI at the same time I installed my Buddyclub short throw shifter.  I get a lot of compliments on this product.
B00LEBLI82|5|Installed these in my travel trailer and my camper shell dome lights.  Great light output and much lower wattage than incandescent.  Color is much cooler than incandescent, but doesn't bother us.  Time will tell how long they last.
B00N99OAWI|5|Work perfectly! The dealer wanted $160 per key, plus programming.  I still had to go to dealer for programming...service writer warned me I'd have to pay even if the keys didn't work -- apparently a common occurrence with 'cheap' keys.  There was no problem with these, though.  I would buy them again.
B00QMKYYYK|5|Very good
B00FEXCG3W|1|absolutely terrible
B00DMNBRVS|5|Excellent but small
B004RZJVAO|5|Just what we needed for the car!!
B001GJ3E2K|5|long handle makes it easy on an old mans back
B003I2TD4Q|5|Well made, and a good enough fit.  Not like the original, so not designed for a restoration, but they locate just fine, and will last forever.
B009PPL604|1|Snake oil. Will &#34;maybe&#34; work but then again waste of money and time.
B00KC3HHVA|5|Good fit needed more velcro
B002QS3F9C|5|works perfect take the inner fender well out to install makes things easy
B000NV2OQE|5|I bought this thermostat for my 02 Dodge Ram 1500 4.7L and I'm berry happy with the results the truck runs a lot cooler it took me about 10 to 15 minutes to install I recommend this product
B0009JKGJ2|5|Great product and price!
B00JK9FTZI|4|This was the only terminal,(neg and pos) that had a battery post along with the power wire inputs. (0,4 and 8 gauge) I was able to put my stock battery terminal on the battery post and my amp wires in the inputs. I would of given it 5 stars if the battery posts were able to go on both sides of the Knuconceptz terminals. Its only on one side so I had to turn the terminals upside down to accomodate the wires. Other than that they still look good upside down and they seem to work well. If I can add a photo later I will.
B00NAPVOAC|5|Great quality
B007ROUBYC|4|very good!!
B00GSAUHB8|5|Works great.
B00GBJ7MUK|4|Very nice
B000EH2SNQ|1|Fits filter, but the center stripped from square to round with the first attempt to loosen filter.  Maybe filter was too tight from previous installation, which was not me, but I expected this wrench to be tougher than it turned out to be.  This did not work and is now worthless to me.
B007HFT034|5|Plug on used camper we bought had the wires bare after the plug.  The hardest part of this installation was the removal of the rubber molded existing plug.  Wire up of the new plug was easy.  Fits in the opening of my electric storage port.  Great item.
B0072AWXZ6|5|OK
B009T9FH6K|5|These are a great fit and great look. It seems like they will last a long time.
B001P6GONU|1|This is a piece of crap
B00R8WBUGG|4|Very Nice, Very bright but more of an aqua blue than a deep blue i was expecting like the other blue JDM 194 light
B002OUIXU8|5|Nice product.
B0011NMM2Y|5|Worked Good
B00SHP50QE|5|It is good little sticker:-)
B000MWKH9A|1|They do not fit the radius of fender.  The nice attaching pivoting screws are not deep enough.
B004Z1JGV4|5|mechanic was pleased and so was I
B00KRNZRUI|5|Everything came as expected and worked fine.
B00FZGYAQE|5|I used this part in my Toyota Corolla and it works great! No problems installing either!
B0031XXW4O|5|Works perfectly in our travel trailer. Such an intelligent design.
B00Q00XPII|4|Fits exactly as expected. Great way to secure valuable electronics. Only downside is that you cannot adjust Ram mount after installed without using the key. Also, it might be easy for a thief to replicate the key, more so than a standard key type.
B001G8M332|4|Came with no instructions. Instructions including the needed measurement between the mounts would have been very nice.
B00MRSNH9E|5|Ty great product!
B00C5THYIK|5|This brake controller is the ideal solution for my 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  The vehicle has limited space for a traditional  brick style controller.  In addition the Jeep has a knee bolster air bag under the steering column further complicating mounting options.<br /><br />The Hopkins Insight let me mount the indicator, manual rheostat, and sensor box in the best location for each without compromising the safety systems. My local Jeep dealer commented how clean the install looked. Installation took about 30 minutes. I used the Hopkins 53035 cable to plug straight into the factory trailer wiring.<br /><br />My first trip went flawlessly. The default settings were perfect right out of the box.  Even if I needed to make an adjustment,  the controls are easy and intuitive. Bottom line, a five star product.
B00IDV3FKU|5|Is what it is.
B002R1TWKO|5|IT IS PERFECT.
B002UC8QCU|5|Perfect for camping or motorhome.  Love the colors - just as pictured and described.
B004I0M1KU|5|Installed easy fast shipping thank you
B00W4Z3P9C|4|Nice light. I would have preferred that it didn't come with the aux outlet adapter on it, but rather the parts or option to get it with the proper parts to hook it directly to the battery. Also the up/down/left/right remote is installed backwards. All that being said its a nice bright light.
B0002M9QK6|5|The headlights (along with a relay upgrade/mod that I did) work very well in my 79 Chevy pickup. They have a sharp cut off and light signs very well. I have not had anyone flash me from them being too bright, but I can see much better than when I had the old sealed beams. I did take the time to aim them at a block wall, at night, to be sure they would put the light where needed. I thought about HID's or LED's but they cost far more, and now I am perfectly happy with these.
B00DU0DXHE|4|Solid jacket for the price.
B00QSIOFDQ|5|Excellent quality
B00FHLOS2I|5|Awesome
B00E6AC0A8|5|Easy to place and holds well
B0024NWV1C|5|The lights help to change the look of front of the vehicle.
B000CN937G|5|Great price on this,works great.period.its a good thing to get if your already changing the shifter
B000C59WFC|5|Moog is tops ! .... Moog always resolves any issues I encounter ...Thanks
B004K6HZFS|5|just what I needed, fits properly, and works great.
B004GCQASY|2|it tilts up and down but not in or out.
B00029XGIM|5|Improvement over standard high beep motorcycle horns.  It is lower, not a huge difference in pitch than the higher horns, but it sounds a lot better.  Note, at first when I installed the horn it was actually touching the motorcycle causing it to make a harsh vibrating noise.  Looking closer I found that the vibration from the horn was rattling against my motorcycle, so I just repositioned it out more and it sounded good.
B000SL4AA2|4|Worked well. Took less than the stated time to inflate a car tire. Unfortunately, everyone here is right - the PSI gauge just doesn't work.<br /><br />At all, for me, actually. It just sat there, limp. Easily remedied with any off-the-shelf pressure gauge, however. Wraps up nicely, and latches on securely.
B00JRHI0W2|3|This mattress is better than the oem that came with our camper. I only have it 3 stars because of how firm it is.
B0071I3650|3|The swivel hinge pin is not tight and the mirror vibrates.  I purchased a right hand mirror and replaced the original mirror.  The left mirror is very steady.  The new right mirror vibrates while driving down the road.  I can't see how to tighten this mirror.
B008BRJ5FA|5|works for jeep 2011 jk fog lights
B0002JN452|5|formidable
B002LF7HHG|5|I purchased this for my 2012 F-150 XLT. I purchased this as a replacement for what was previously on my truck. I was apprehensive at first about applying this myself, and if you have an extra person, it is very easy. The vent comes with 3M double sided tape, which is very sticky, so make sure you read the instructions on how to install first. If you follow the instructions, you will not have any problems on installation.<br />Product arrived via UPS, in good order. Box is large and cumbersome, however the product is well protected. Adds a very sleek and stylish look to my truck.<br />*As note, ensure the area you are applying this too is free of dirt/grime, and if you have recently polished your vehicle, you may need to purchase the 3M prep cleaner prior to applying the vent.
B00HWMD2P4|5|Exellent
B000CQOITQ|5|Does the job.  Great quality and it's nice and shiney.  LOL
B004C3C22K|3|Tough but no as long as I needed, ... had to join two together.
B00DQJB948|1|2 month old GMC SIERRA 1500, just took it to the car wash . In there I heard  something hit my passenger window like a penny. As I drove away I had no radio reception. Got home to see antenna was gone and the adapter it comes with was still in there but the top part is snapped off. Horrible reception but looks good. Just ordered another one. Can't comment on discoloration yet because it was only on for two months. Thank god this POS didn't scratch my paint inside the car wash as it got thrown from my car.
B00IGEMB18|4|You get what you pay for. They are sufficient. Just a little cheaply made. No big deal, I didn't want to spend a bunch of money. They look good in my Jeep.
B001QIGWS4|5|Completely satisifed...I installed it myself...quick delivery as well was a real benefit along with excellent value/low price!
B00064333G|4|Works great. No bristles to fall off or scratch your wheels. It rinses off well too. I wish the handle was a bit longer though.
B001RS4YOM|3|the studs are too small for what I needed,
B003EOVFYO|5|good quality, direct fit
B004JKW2J4|4|We needed to buy a waterproof durable bag to wrap a large rolled up handloomed Tibetan carpet in for carrying on several International flights. We were able to fit it in diagonally and the extra straps that came with this bag helped to create a tight fit and a carrying strap. We know this is not the intended end use for this cargo rack bag but just were so relieved to find something suitable for our special needs. The carpet made its way to its destination intact and without any problem from customs or damaging elements.
B004FSQ8KO|4|works fits well
B00SVEQPRE|5|Great sticker and great seller I ordered 1 large and seller also sent 1 smaller sticker for FREE!!
B00D8KLK9O|5|This really looks nice on my F150!!!!
B004RZMCCI|1|My boat/trailer gets dunked in the Pacific every weekend, both are washed thoroughly with fresh water after use. I started experiencing problems with these lights after 4 weeks and they were completely useless 6 dunks in salt water.  Do not buy if you regularly launch in the ocean.
B009NLNNM4|1|Fits good on a E-350. Heat in cab is about the same with or without. May do some uv protection for the interior but that is about all. Not worth the cost for what I was looking for which was to reduce sun heat from windshield.
B00FPL2D2C|5|ok
B0041EBSV6|4|Purchased 2 sets of the 100lb part April 2012.  They worked well for about 3 years when one failed completely, losing all of it's fluid in the bed of my truck.  So I had a spare to install.  The originals lasted 8 years in my 2004 pickup.
B000VKZN3I|5|My 2001 Sport Trac sound like new again. This muffler is perfect for this vehicle.
B007RRSZQ0|2|paint looks streaky and doesn't really blend with stock paint.
B000N9LRHS|5|Will definitely encourage the common opportunistic criminal to move on to an easier target, but I'm pretty sure a professional will have the keys on hand. Solved that by tig welding a spot to make standard keys not work.

B00M7I5YZO|5|I wasn't sure I should buy this I didn't think it would stay on or last but I am glad I did looks great stays in place and take abuse glad I bought this
B00QVP9VDA|5|Ok, it's 7 am on a January Tuesday, you have given yourself no time for what you are about to see on your car windshield, nice thick, hard as a rock, ice, you now have to scrape it off, but your plastic scraper can't make a dent in it. It is like trying to make a hole in concrete with a plastic spoon.<br />  You look across the street and your neighbor Big Bob, says good morning to you as he peels off this snow and ice cover, no ice on HIS windshield, he gets in his car and drives to work on time....you on the other hand have managed to make a credit card size area clear of ice to drive to work....don't do that, not safe, buy this cover, I bought one for each car, works great
B0128D4I7W|4|When I saw this Zone Tech organizer for the side of a car seat, I was very intrigued.  I have kick mats on the backs of my front row seats that provide some storage, but of course those pockets are difficult for me to reach when I'm driving, so I was hoping this would provide some useful storage on the side of the passenger seat.  As other reviewers have also mentioned, the organizer attaches simply via a single velcro strap which hooks around the headrest of the passenger seat. This strap is designed well, but with only a single place to fasten the product, there is no way to keep it securely on the side of the seat while the car is in motion.  It would be useful to find a way to secure it around the base of the seat back so that it does not move around.<br /><br />With that said, I am still finding this to be quite useful.  The upper portion has two mesh pockets, one that is fairly small and another in front that is both deeper and wider.  The small one is really useful for me during my work commute in the morning.  I have to swipe my work badge when I enter the parking lot at work and usually am fumbling through my purse to find it at the last minute.  Since I got this organizer I've been trying to remember when I first get in the car to take the badge out of my purse and put it in this small mesh pouch - voila, I know exactly where it is when I get to work!  The larger mesh pouch is plenty big for my cell phone, so I know where the phone is if I need to access anything.  The bottom portion of the organizer has a zipper-closure pouch.  I find this pouch to be useful for keeping loose change.<br /><br />I'm glad that I was able to order this at a promotional discount in order to evaluate and provide my honest review.
B00F4E2OPQ|2|Solenoid housing is longer than the stock number this was supposed to replace. It won't fit in the watertight housing so. Ow I'm back to square 1.

B00RVEAZ9E|5|Great decals for all the Mazda lovers out there, like me. Mazda used to sell similar decals years ago, I even got one in the mail from Mazda Coporate when I bought my first Mazda in 2006. These decals are great and look exactly like the one I got back in '06.

B00PE2QWDS|4|good little table but would not put too much weight on it.  Good for a coffee cup and an iPad.
B0007V9XAU|5|Just got this today and installed it in about 45 minutes by myself.  Instructions aren't really needed, it bolts directly to the frame and is designed to fit the Frontier / Xterra / Pathfinder that share the same frame.  A second hand might have been a good idea, but I was able to hold it up with my knees and bolt it on with my arms.  It's heavy!  You're probably best off setting a milk crate or something similar underneath it to hold it up while you put the bolts in.  I put 2 bolts in each end and tightened 80% before adding the last bolts.  This took the weight off, and still allowed me to line up the final bolt on each end.  Overall, I'm confident this thing will tow without issue.
B007ESQW08|4|The product display is easily readable, and the housing is a solid plastic.  Getting 20 amp out of the compact design is very desirable when traveling in an RV.  It detected my battery type (AGM), voltage and charge condition automatically as soon as it was connected.  I would give this five stars except the charger was delivered with loose parts rattling around in the case.  After removing 14 screws, I found two broken, metal parts in the case.  The charger seemed complete with no broken parts in use.  It is working as advertised after removing the parts which could have shorted out the unit.
B00Q3B50Z0|5|thanx
B002MGUO7Y|1|Product did not work as indicated and there were no instructions in box.
B006GWVBQ8|1|Sent it back, does not work as stated...smells like vinegar...hmmmmm
B0092QWD9O|5|I hate how I have to purchase one of these, but it's so much quicker than using my phone on the stations. If you use the WattStations every day, then get one, it's very handy.
B001U60T9U|3|I purchased for occasional use for my F150 and this is what I would recommend. The fabric is lightweight and I doubt it would hold up to regular/daily use. It's a nylon like fabric with a foam backing. For the money it's a reasonable product. You will need to cut holes for headrest and seat belt on rear cover.
B00C30H9UE|5|I ordered this sunshade for my new Subaru Crosstrek.  Shade fits perfectly for the entire front window.  I would highly recommend this product,
B000UR9JXC|1|This product sucks. Cheap. DONT BUY!!! My husband installed it and 2 weeks later the bar was defective. 30 day return policy so now what.... Ripped up money and throw it in the trash. No replacement honored here.
B00T1PH8Q4|5|The left side actually for the right side better so there you go left on right. I only needed the right side. The part fit and went on so easy my 5 year old grand son put it on by himself. I can not tell the difference between the OEM and the replacement part. Now the bad if you live in a state like I do that requires a front plate there is not a intention for the plate to go on if you have a ecoboost but for the pri's a few screws and done
B003LT3UOU|3|I bought 1 a few years ago. It was foreign but not from a country know for cheap garbage tools.<br />It was from a name brand company I think in Europe.  The one I have  works very good.<br />I have a few others I thought the rolling cam worked better with steel line. Plenty heavy  enough to get the job done.<br />The one I bought was about $90. At the new price I find it hard to believe it is made by same people same people that made mine.<br />No fan of Eastwood.<br />Giving it 3 stars because I do not know if it was made by old company.<br />If it was made by old Co. I would give it 5 stars.<br />If they are using low priced knock off I would not rate it that high.<br />Plenty of those tools on market and they rarely deliver.<br />Hope Eastwood did not go for low priced knock off.
B007HGE2JU|5|Dealer installed this as part of the deal.  Looks good and works good.
B00WIWRSC6|2|I have ordered these lights 3 times and they do not come with a wire harness or a switch as they are advertised to come with as a kit
B00BITJVOS|5|Delivery on time and good quality 😊
B000X23UP2|5|Perfect fit for my Toyota Sienna.  The size is just right to fit behind my third row seating.  Would highly recommend.
B00NQ6X3B8|5|Looks great in front of my car
B003XCBBL4|5|Easy to place and holds well
B000A8JNF0|5|You will love it. It makes your top brand new and the rain just slides off. Amazing find!
B00I3RCI8O|5|Perfect replacement for the original parts and a great price too.  I hope I never need to replace them again, but if I do, this will be the first stop.
B00I0AZDUO|3|hard to install with the hardware supplied. we had to buy extra hardware to complete instalation
B009XQKCQY|1|Does not work right out of the box
B007HRVO5O|5|Way better than the OEM shower head.  I drilled out the flow restriction a bit to increase the flow, which was very easy to do.  Fits into my outside shower compartment better than the original and works really well.  I like that it stays on until you push down on the activation lever -- makes it easy to use the outside shower to fill wash tubs with hot water for doing dishes on the picnic table.  A real winner!
B000760FWU|4|stack well for storage solidly built
B005CLMYOW|5|Great
B000CNJAKQ|5|Good product
B0002UHVAA|3|Works as advertised
B000SE6RPU|5|Look and fit are just perfect! Give the car a very nice look, price is right.
B004K8UY72|5|Absolutely perfect!!! Even got here two weeks early!! Fixed my problem 100% !!!
B000N3ILY6|5|Item as described.  Perfect fit
B00A5A7N96|5|Easy application
B00O83OF38|5|Great look on my blacked out F150.  Very pleased!  Works great, easy installation.
B009DJSKQA|1|Poor company and poor quality product. Flimsy and cheap. Zero stars. The grill did not come with the insert as advertised. The company contacted me after e-mailing them and they said they made a mistake and would correct the listed. They refunded me $35.00 but have to correct the listing. Also be wary that my father had other dealings with them when purchasing a hood. The hood was poor quality and came dented. The refunded partially but when I closed the hood it dented in another spot! I had to go through the ringer to get a refund.<br /><br />AutoParts Giant: Are you going to correct the listing or simply try to mislead more people? It's been three days.
B00T0WYDV6|5|Paid 30 dollars for all the windows 20%. Couldn't get the back window tinted, we suck. Not gonna blame the tint. But honestly not a bad job. I got my back tinted for 40 and it ended up being 70 dollars for tinting my whole Honda civic 09 ex. As a Florida driver, this is one of the best investments I've made on my car.
B0080DWP1G|5|on time and works fine!
B004ME11FS|5|Good quality .  Easy to tighten.
B005ZFUKCI|4|It's a little expensive, but worth it!
B001BADD1G|4|This charger seems to work just fine. I bought it for the manual mode to charge a battery that was too dead for my &#34;smart&#34; charger. The 2 amp mode works well for smaller batteries (for motorcycles). One thing I wish it had was a power switch; that would make it much easier than having to plug/unplug every time.
B004YTP12U|5|these mats fit my 2012 Ford Escape perfectly. the seller was very helpful, as well.
B006PKUXU6|5|Works great
B00JVHLS3G|1|Everything looked great but this comes in two pieces.  The double stick glue on the emblem does not adhere well and the emblem blew off at highway speeds.  I have sent two messages to the seller and have had no reply. If you do purchase this I would suggest using a different adhesive.
B000UTQUAK|4|I like it
B003MYOGH4|4|works good
B0089K6O7G|5|The key worked perfectly
B0006IX85A|5|Is working good. My pup chewed everything he could off the camp trailer. Now it's time to replace it all.
B00J321CAI|5|I am a Piano Tuner. A restaurant I tune for likes to keep their shiny black piano looking like new. They have been buying Cory Piano Cleaner from the Dealer. The corporate office wanted the management to get it from me so I could just bill it on my tuning invoice as needed. I was always under impressed with the Cory product and it only comes in an 8 oz. spray bottle @ $15. I also don't like having to overpay for a product only to have to then mark it up even more and justify it because the label says the product is for a piano. The High Gloss black piano finish is polyester resin, the same as a corvette.<br />  I shopped the aisle at Auto Zone and was most impressed by the Mothers Spray Detailer. ( Yes, I read the label, but I also have to spray a sample of the product on my fingers to check the consistency and smell and evaporation rate to make sure it is not too different from the piano cleaner.) When I found the Eagle One on the top shelf in a special box I couldn't believe it was only $7.50. I set it on the check-out counter and went to look for some motor oil and when I came back the counter man was reading the label and scanning the UPC to see how much it was. He said he was going to switch to it for his motorcycle.<br />  Of course I have to product test a new product before I can sell or recommend it for use on a $50,000 piano. So on my next piano cleaning in a clients home I went ahead and applied the Eagle One NanoWax and it really cleaned swirl marks and residue off the black finish and left a glossy shine like that piano hasn't had in years.<br />IMPORTANT!!!!!  ( DO NOT GET ANY OVERSPRAY IN OR WIPE ANY PRODUCT INSIDE A PIANO AT ALL!!! )<br />  I HIGHLY recommend the EAGLE ONE NANOWAX for HIGH GLOSS EBONY BLACK PIANO FINISH.
B00HCTIW0W|5|Easy to install and work great!
B0094JKMII|1|No stability in the cross bars - too much spring.  The car top carrier that we put on them bounced constantly while driving at highway speeds.
B00HZBTHD8|3|Did not like the color it should have been yellow and not that green tone
B008VGQKG8|5|best window cleaner ever
B002EDTOGC|5|Works great
B004G9VIXE|5|fixed the problem of 4 years with my van door.
B008VQP3YS|5|Heavy duty and built well.
B0006IX87S|5|Hopefully, it works like it should. These definitely work great to avoid water spots when washing my truck.
B00KUL76TW|4|Fits my 2008 Chevy Silverado 2500HD fine but I already knew that GM had done away with installation of cabin filters and the corresponding access door on my particular year of truck.  With that knowledge I went ahead and purchased the GM Filter Kit, GM# 22759208, so I could install this filter.  Access to the location where the filter kit door goes is pretty simple with just the removal of 2 small screws holding the cover on the HVAC system.  Once the screws are removed the HVAC cover can be pulled down and pushed to the side to gain access to the HVAC unit.  The HVAC unit still has the molding lines where the HVAC filter and door were intended to be installed so it was easy to locate the proper place to cut for removal.  I used a small pick bent at 90 degrees on the end to scrape along the mold lines in order to cut my access hole for the filter.  The plastic is fairly soft and the pic easily scraped thru the housing.  Once the opening was cut out for installation of the filter, the filter was installed in the HVAC housing and the filter kit, which consisted of a door and a screw, was installed to button everything up.  The HVAC cover was reinstalled using the 2 screws which were removed and the job took all of about an hour from start to finish.  On a side note, the segmented side of the filter faces towards the drivers side of the truck according to the GM installation instructions.
B002L1GLQ8|4|good seat
