B00CAJMGDI|5.0|My brother has been telling me about Lindsey Stirling for a while but I can't believe it took me so long to get around to buying her album.  This is the perfect music to get me energized!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is a good battery app.  I am still new to my Kindle and I am still learning but this app is easy to use and customizable.  Good choice!
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I chose twitter to follow current events and a couple well known people who twit inspirirational messages. That is good about the site. I don't find anything other uses for the site.
B001993Y2C|5.0|Everything the notes mention and then some. I got a collector's trophy. Yeah!<br /><br />I am very impressed with the quality and the style of the box.<br /><br />I haven't had a chance to start watching the series and while it was on SyFy channel, I lost many opportunities to keep up with the story line, but now that I have the collection, I can sit back, enjoy to learn if we humans ever got home and if we finally destroyed the Cylons. Don't anyone tell me, I want to find out for myself. See ya at the movies!!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Just finished this book and not disappointed.  Chapters are long but tells each person's life.  Can't wait to sit a discuss with book club!
B00007G207|3.0|The director's cut with new ending is appalling.  Philippe Noiret could be my favoraite actor, Of course the original version is there, too.
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|Their is so much here that is totally unbelievable.  At times the characters can frustrate you to the point that you wish Dexter would cut their throat. But at the same time that's what makes Dexter a joy to watch. I give it 4 1/2 stares.  Take of 1/2 star for the parts with Dexter being a loving dad or loving brother just doesn't make since for a serial killer.
B0037B6QSY|5.0|Full value for the lessons and message in this book. Just the parts on being a parent offered amazing but simple lessons I've already applied. Thank you Jon.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Memorable characters.  Sad and funny.  Work of fiction with a based on historical fact.  Beautifully written.  I found myself reading passages aloud just to hear it.
B00CF2UORK|5.0|I watch this with my grandson on my Kindle and we love Shaw the Sheep. It is simply amazing what the producers of this series can do with a lump of clay. Keep 'em coming.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great series so far.  Just started watching it.  Nice to see a post apocalyptic series where the characters show some sense, rather than making the same stupid mistakes over and over again.
B005TBN3EU|3.0|A few laugh out loud moments.  Not as good as the first one.  OK to watch if you want to know the set
B00CWY76CC|2.0|This game comes with no guidelines - no hints - I did not get very far on this one - it became too frustrating to try and figure some of the rooms out.  I would not recommend this if you just want a relaxing game.
B000BW7QWW|3.0|I loved the series, but the movie wasn't as good.  They killed everyone off.  The people I loved in the series seemed more self absorbed.
B007ZCOT6C|4.0|Really liked this book. I've read a lot of bad high school romance books recently but I really enjoyed this one! Thanks so much!
1932735410|5.0|I'm about half way through this and it is an excellent refresher and exam prep book for the PMP. I will update with results of my exam.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The actors are great, Anna is my favorite and her husband in the show. Love to watch in my kindle on my own time.
0920236162|5.0|What an excellent message for girls surrounded by the princess culture. This is the first introduction to princesses for my 3 year old and I am so happy that she can take away the message that girls or princesses don't have to be limpid,sorry creatures but those who make their own destinities. My 3 yr. old asks for this book every single night. I am here to buy more of Munsch.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|I bought the full version, and it is worth it. There is so many more options. The only thing I do not like about this app is that every time I finish the salon treatment it crashes, and I have to start all over. I know I can skip ahead of the spa treatment, but it's not the same. Hope this helps.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I loved it.  I had a hard time putting the book down.  The characters are real, and all have their flaws.  This makes them human and very readable.  It's full of excitement, and at times, I'd have loved to let Claire and Jamie have a few months peace!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I can't believe how easy things are getting! How wonderful it is not to have to stop and dig out a calculator from somewhere else. And it does everything I need it to do. I will tell all my friends about this app.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I love reading it on the go. Thank you Amazon for making this available for free. Works great on my tablet and phone.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Does not work on Android 4.1.1. Splash screen opens then it quits. Too bad. Any chance for an update in the near future?
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|My son watched this when he was 3 and he is now 9 and still loves it! He watches it along with my 6, 3 and 2 year olds!
B003FFEX8C|1.0|This movie is SO AWFUL that I could only make it through about half of it. I kept thinking as I was watching that it must have been a joke or that the filmmakers were trying to be ironic in a way that I hadn't quite figured out. The script is ridiculous. The acting is schmaltzy and disingenuous. Don't waste your time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved it! Challenging and different. There are no hints from the game but but with any game hints are available on the internet. I sure hope they make more than just 8 levels!
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Love the dialogue!  one of the best of all time!  Play it again Sam!  Our troubles don't amount to a hill beans!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is one of the best listing ever! Super for all age groups and the music is upbeat yet relaxing. Love it!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed all of the fifty shades books. It was very interesting and enlighting on ones true love and commentant.
B009ZFPQOQ|2.0|I expected an improvement over regular GPS but this was much more difficult to navigate.  I relied on it in a situation where there was a road closure (I later found out) and the only info I got from Waze was that traffic was stopped.  The worst part was when I tried to get out of the mess, meanwhile calling the appointment I was going to miss, Waze kept intruding into my conversation telling me repeatedly to turn around.  I had to get off the call, turn Waze off and make the call again.  Too irritating to be worthwhile!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game because you have to put the pieces together and solve the puzzle. This game is tricky but fun and I think you should try it.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I liked it but I found the use of all the Italian distracting (even though they translated it) and found myself having to go back and re-read sections without the Italian in order to continue the story.  Kind of confusing.  No nearly as good as his other books.
B009CG29RK|5.0|Great children's movie that is also hilarious for adults. We watch it over and over and always laugh. Charming characters and great story!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Love it love it love it!!! I am so addicted to the series. This was my first experience with watching a series on the computer or tablet and I loved it! I will do it again!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Not only is it an easy read, it draws you in from the first page to the last. I definitely recommend reading it.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|One of the few quality shows left on TV.  Great acting, great storyline and a good cast make for a very good show.  Looking forward to watching season 2.
B0093QHWLC|4.0|I enjoyed this movie because it was unpredictable.  I might have given it 5 stars but it could be unsettling at times.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Hated this game would not start did not know how to even begin so I uninstalled this game waste of time
B003YFIUW8|4.0|It was very intersting to realize the things we take for granted that we wouldn't know if we had not been exposed to them in a normal situation
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I absolutely love this game at first I was a bit hesitant to get out but I read the reviews and I bought it and I don't regret it!!!! So fun I also do the craziest styles! You'll have a blast with this app! I hope this helped!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The first few chapters set the scene for the rest of the book and it doesn't take off until about a third of the way in, but if you make it that far, there's no way you won't finish it. A lot of people claimed the ending was a 'cop out', but I disagree. There are a lot of ways it could have ended and I'm happy with the author's choice. Great character development - leaves you constantly changing which one you root for. Will be getting more of her books in the future.
1440778183|5.0|He loves any of these books and will listen over and over. He's twelve years old and can't get enough of the Wimpy Kid!
B004GYY714|5.0|I go for a walk or ride the bike and tune in to listen to what I want.  Only one thing if you are near the edge of the range of your wireless, turn off wifi and just get your music via 3G or 4G.
B0016O5HLG|5.0|great 60 ish jangle and rockin tunes with great hooks and harmonies, a 1st class classic recording, i cant hide takes me away.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|Me & My Child Love this Game!!  Cool Levels!!  Makes me glad we got this game to add to our collection!!  Love my Kindle Fire way better than my IPAD!!
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|i bought both these movies for my granddaughter on her 18th birthday.  I loved them and I knew she would, also.  I thought they were  excellent.<br />Bonnie Cadwell
B00873GRU4|5.0|Wool is an amazing book.  The style does not feel overdone, and the absence of errors makes for a seamless reading.<br /><br />The three strengths of the story are...<br />- The world that Hugh Howey has created is believable and utterly engrossing.<br />- Key scenes keep you captivated, with the pacing picking up to breakneck speed at times.<br />- The characters are realistic.  No one is truly 'good' or 'bad'...despite what you may think of them.<br /><br />My lasting memory of the book however is not of Jules or any other specific single character.  Near the end of the book I felt that the book was good, but the people of this world lacked the depth of (for example) George Martin's characters.  I was wrong.  Within 24 hours of finishing the book I missed all of them. This world of people underground, and all of them with their unique stories to unfold before us. I missed the people of this world.<br /><br />Whether this book is a 'classic' or not is of little relevance.  Sometimes a book will be read, and you'll feel fortunate to have encountered the novel.  This is one of those books.  My life is better in a small way for Hugh Howey's first installment of this trilogy.
B004TI5N38|3.0|Zero is not a bad read the turns and twists keeps you interested until the ending which is kind of corny ..
B000YABS8E|5.0|I am a child of the 50's - 60's.  My dad was an engineer.  He built a bomb shelter as an addition to our house.<br />That helps put my rating in perspective.<br />Christopher Walken is dad; Sissy Spacek is mom.  Good son Brendan Fraser spends his life underground and then returns to the surface to meet Valley Girl Alicia Silverstone.<br />It's a sweet and funny movie, and I love Brendan Fraser when he's not fighting mummies and other apparitions.  My dad was nothing like this dad.  The idea of an engineer with a sense of humor intrigued me.  And I marvelled at the bomb shelter.  But the genuine niceness of so many of the characters is what is most pleasant about this movie. It may be more of a 4.5 stars, but since 4 stars is just &#34;I liked it&#34;, I had to give it 5 because, for me, this is a movie I want to own.<br />(By the way, our bomb shelter was Nothing like Christopher Walken's bomb shelter!)
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I felt like I was right on the trail with her.  My feet hurt with every blister she described.  It's an experience one remembers but does not care to repeat.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|Me & My Child Love this Game!!  Cool Levels!! Makes me glad we got this game to add to our collection!!  Love my Kindle Fire way better than my IPAD!!
B0050PYNP8|4.0|Unusual, silly, not believable. Comical at times. It could have used more substance. All an all it was funny and somewhat entertaining. A different kind of alien.
B005MHI0QM|5.0|Growing up, I knew who Anne Frank was and I thought I knew her story, but reading this book made me respect her so much more. Her wit, confidence and spunk is so admirable, especially now having understood the sad experience she and her Annex family had to endure. This is a good read for pre-teens and adults alike, to remind us to not take anything for granted. It also makes me appreciate those who risked their own lives to help protect and support those in hiding. Anne Frank sounds like a young girl who was ready to take on the world. Her hopeful and ambitious spirit is truly inspiring. It's nice to see how this young girl's story has had an impact on so many even 70 years later.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|My son saw it in the movies and surprisingly, he asked could we order the movie immediately after leaving the theatre, rare for him because he usually says kids movies are ok, or all right.  Avengers is one of the other movies that he wanted to order immediately after seeing the movie
B003BW0CB6|5.0|I'm a big fan of Lincoln lawyer and also Harry Bosch so it fit well with my reading,  the author really go things moving in the beginning and kept your interest all the way to the end. When you think you have it all figured out you find that you're heading down the wrong path.<br /><br />If you like the characters as I do you'll really enjoy the book
B001CTGQBK|5.0|what I enjoy most  about grease is that brings all generations of my famyly together I'm surprized I don't own it I use to.Idin't realized all my nieceswant it to watchitis agreat classic where you can see how hot john Travolta looked inthat movie andthe wonderful voice Olivia has.this is a movie for all times.

B0092S4WLY|3.0|it is challenging but if ur stuck ur stuck. needs a hint option if u reach that point of total frustration. I have yet to find an escape game that is worth it yet.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Wow, and Sylvia Day continues to surprise me with her deft touch at portraying this relationship without shying away from the ugly, the bad and the truly great.<br /><br />So many author's just sell you this relationships where everything is roses and rainbows and butterflies. Where no one ever gets mad or distrust their partner or where they never, ever fight at all and no one has any hang ups at all. Those relationships are not reality, a relationship is the merger or two people and those people are individuals with different views on love and how to express it.<br /><br />Eva and Gideon are two who love each other immensely but they are also people who have been terribly hurt by events in their life. This abuse is bound to affect their relationship, I am so happy that Day does not take the easy way out and solves everything through sex and gives us a happy ending. Eva and Gideon have to work for their happiness and to keep their love and that is why I love this series.<br /><br />Really, I am hooked on this relationship and series. I am really happy there is more books ahead.
B005LAII6C|4.0|Good movie, my wife had reservations about letting our 8-year-old view it, she said that some of the guised adult human was too much
B00D3V85FA|5.0|Haters gonna hate, but as someone who grew up with Sabbath, I love this album. The Godfathers of dark metal have logged another entry in their timeless catalog, and I would say that this compares well to any any other Sabbath release. Listen for yourself. If you're reading this review it means you're interested, and I say take the plunge.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Living in the USA I had no idea what this show was and as soon as I watched the first episode I was hooked! Very addictive and will force you to watch whole seasons at a time.
B004J4RQIM|5.0|Saw some of it on tv had to have it the artist the late great Donna Summer the songs the respect David Foster shows for them loved every bit of it !!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|not a bad game. too short and no hints are the only down sides. Looking forward to new levels. Good job.
B0047SIXGE|5.0|Love Vietnam flicks. Great actor lineup. Quite a bit more footage than the original cut. I recommend. I think it's close to 3 hours.
B000002WYT|5.0|I AM A HUGE FAN OF DAVE MATTHEWS BAND, THIS CD IS SO WORTH THE PRICE AND MORE OF IT.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|Just previewed all the songs and they sound god awful. He's gone from bad to worse. It's to bad people like this get paid. The sad thing is he thinks he is an artist with talent. The kid need a reality check. Where is the real hip hop?
B004FEFS5E|4.0|I hoped to understand my new DSLR's control functions in order to be more artful with my new hobby. It has indeed helped. I wouldn't say this is ALL I need, but it was a great piece.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|good but it doesn't give you a lot of time to play before you have to purchase it. but other than that its fun.
B00005JA8B|5.0|at his best.  What more is needed.  Jesse Ventura was funny, It is a jungle setting  where the team must seek and destroy  a super human shape shifting being
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love the narrator great for studying....Benefits the whole family! Great for getting to scriptures in church and studies as well.
0321934946|5.0|As a 30 years enthusiast photographer,  I find this book Very handy, very useful, teach me a lot of tips and doing it with great fun and joy.<br />I bought all the series, including volumes 2-4.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|there's nothing about this show that I don't like and I can watch a segment more than once and get more out of it the second time!  Fascinating!!
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|We watch movies to be entertained and this movie did just that. Just enough action mixed in with expected plot twists to keep us engaged.
B004Q3UL2O|1.0|I was very disappointed with this movie. It's like they thought of every romance comedy cliche there is and threw it in there whether it fit the story or not. In my opinion, in order to make up for the tremendously poor story, the movie had tons of nudity scenes. I wouldn't recommend it to any one. It's a waste of time.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I bought it because it had the mash-ups on it.  Was a little disappointed at first that the soundtrack was of the actor and not the original artists, but after listening to the CD, I was pleasantly surprised.  Has become the current favorite CD in the house.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|Can watch over and over.  Probable beset 1st season of any show.  The need a movie to follow up.  WOOT!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I love adventure, excitement and special effects.  These movies make me feel like a kid again...... who definitely got her monies worth.  Everyone should see this tale, as well as the three that were made before it.  Simply GREAT!
B00C8USQEM|3.0|Disc 2 of season 5 will not play all the rest play fine except for that. My blu ray player feature settings are up to date
1416511946|5.0|If you haven't read this yet, put it on your bucket list if you enjoy hard core truths about drug use and addiction. It's a very candid look into the  life of Nikki Sixx of Motley Crue. I couldn't put it down and would definitely recommend this book as a MUST READ.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Not what I was expecting but really enjoyed it.I liked how the author took so many different point of views and experiences during this war.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|Great game but it freezes, glitches and crashes constantly. It wont load half the time and I really do not suggest getting it for Kindle. Leave it to Disney to make something that doesn't work and wants one to spend more money every few minutes.. ugh.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|i get stressed at night, and this app makes it so easy to fall asleep. the right combonation is everything, though. listen to all of them and combine similar ones for awesome, relaxing sounds.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|Better than the VHS I had as a kid.  Though I do not have a 3D blue ray player.  Keep that in mind 3D blue ray player is different than a regular blue ray player.  And very different from normal DVD player.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I play a lot of these games. This one is one of the best. The graphics are great and like the storyline.
B000SW4DV2|5.0|It has a good plot line and the animation is excellent.  Lots of action.  I enjoyed it. it is worth watching.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is by far the best and easiest jigsaw puzzle to play. I saw my Granddaughter playing this on her Kindle and had to put it on mine. Love it.
6305127697|4.0|Richard gere's nice try!<br />Really diffrent as the &#34; perty woman&#34;!<br />Still very handsome man.<br />Cool guy!<br />We like richard's new style!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Let me get this out of my system first. Tyrion who? Thorin is the KING. Well, now that's out, I have to say I love this movie. And I love it for the very same reasons others might hate it.<br /><br />First, it's the first third of the Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien. It's not the whole story, was not advertised as such, and people who complain it's incomplete amaze me: they need to read a description first, or maybe a press release, and know what to expect.<br /><br />Second, of course it seems like a precursor to the real happenings, because it is. This is just the first part of Bilbo's journey, and despite his fervent hope it's the worst, it is not, by far. That's the key - the story is to be continued, and this movie does not work that well as a stand-alone, but I can absolutely live with that. And will eagerly await the sequel.<br /><br />Thirdly, at first I was bewildered when I saw clear parallels between the Hobbit and Lord of the Ring movies (there was a scene where, if you don't look too closely, the dwarves and Bilbo would pass for the Fellowship, traversing the magnificent wilds of Middle-earth). It seemed a stretch, seeing this group of bumbling characters in such epic settings. They seemed so out of place, at first I thought Peter Jackson tried to make an epic out of a fairy-tale, and failed miserably. Then halfway through the movie it dawned on me: the characters might be a bit bumbling, but they do inhabit the same epic land named Middle-earth. And ready or not, they will have to find their way in it, find their way home. As soon as I understood this, the jarring feeling of out-of-placeness faded, and I was able to enjoy the journey.<br /><br />And fourth, the characters themselves. Bilbo is yet to come into his prime (I though he was getting there by the end, with the Gollum scene and especially with orc confrontation), and the wizard/elf/necromancer politics are a bit out there yet, but the interactions between the dwarves and their characterization are superb. I absolutely love Fili and Kili, and let me say this, I could call Thorin my king.<br /><br />So, to conclude, ignore the nay-sayers, watch the movie, and judge for yourself.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have used this since I had an HTC Hero. It looks good, works perfectly and is worth it's weight in gold :-).  I even side loaded it onto my KF to replace Swype (which I truly dislike).<br />SwiftKey is fast and accurate.<br />I have hand/thumb problems and using one finger is the best option for me.<br />I have recommended this to everyone that complains about their keyboard.
B007N31YH0|5.0|This DVD replaces a VHS tape of the same movie.  Robert Redford and Neuman are great in this film.  I am only replacing great films.
0425263924|5.0|Could not wait for Entwined With You to hit the shelf!  And I was not disappointed! Sylvia Day hit this one out of the park!!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|The first one I got for free was good, I completed all four levels in and out but this one is very tricky and requires more concentration....not to mention faster reflexes to get the best time. One of my favorite games and I don't have to wait for anyone to give me anything to get to the next level!
B0029LCJJS|4.0|Had heard for a long time how good this series was but never had an opportunity to watch it. With a new Kindle Fire and an Amazon Prime membership I am catching up on all the series I have missed. I am not always a fan of \\"period pieces\\" but The Tudors definitely lives up to the hype! Fascinating to see history played out this way. Highly recommended.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|After the past twenty years of the Die Hard roller coaster I had low expectations for the movie, however I found this to be very entertaining. Found this to be on par with Red and the Ezpendables.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|I wanted to see it when it was in the theatres but never made it. I'm glad I purchased it was better than I thought it would be. I've seen a couple of different versions this one is definitely the less cheesy of all the ones I've seen.
B007DA2FHG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and have watched it a few times that's why I bought it for my daughter she loved it and has watched it a few times also she loves horses and this movie
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Great all the way around, graphics, addictibility and fun. Having to limit myself trying to beat all the goals in one day. Simple and enjoyable.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Fun game-but did have one issue with getting a later level to save, kept freezing up on me.ended up startling over. But overall I Love the game
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I don't know anything about Vikings - this show is a great insight into how they might have lived and also has interesting characters and intriguing story lines. I'm still early in the season but have been hooked from episode 1!!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Love this album in its entirety. Every single song has a purpose and has a great flow and builds up and morphs into an amazing rock experience. Don't know how these guys did it but they have. Love the guitars and Ozzy's voice.
0786958731|4.0|I'm anxious to write my own campaigns for this.  I was pleasantly surprised by the fun of the campaigns given though.  The figures are well made and the pieces seem sturdy.  My only complaint is the cards bend easily.
B00514HDNW|3.0|I needed more descriptive descriptions of the area and why he was there by himself.  The movie provided more information.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|It's been a while since I enjoyed reading a book this much... the kind of book you go to bed with, then wake up wishing it were bedtime already so you could read it some more.  I will never order flowers the same way again!
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|I mean it's a great slender game, but I just had to look away from him and he left, only to return for me to look away from again. Also, I got all 8 notes on my first try. Good game. Just needs to be scarier and harder. Maybe slender could come behind us, when we look away. I don't know. This one was just too easy
B0094K1PW4|1.0|Just watched this on Amazon Prime.  I feel like I wasted an hour and a half.  How does one have sympathy for a monstrous creature that destroys (those evil military personnel)and many innocent civilians and then flies home like ET with the KIds all smiling.  Spielberg just gets weirder and weirder.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|The motorcycle chase to open the movie would have lasted 5 seconds and killed 20 bystanders in real life. He is shot twice but seems to have only one wound. He drops into the water from hundreds of feet, goes over the falls and only requires the skills of a local to heal him. He is hit with a depleted uranium round and has fragments just under the skin that he removes months later on a whim. The bad guy has the info and only releases 5 names at a time and everyone assumes that he has not trafficked the names secretly to anyone else.  The bad guy's years in the planning scheme involves rigging the underground with explosives that he detonates just as Bond has him cornered and just as a train is right above him, hacking MI6, and culminates in him trying to bring down M and the government by bursting into a meeting armed with a hand gun. Bond goes to get his old car, drives to Scotland and forgets to bring any weapons. The entire movie was laughably cartoonish and required a lobotomy, not a willing suspension of disbelief to enjoy.
B00D3V5V7U|5.0|Time is not a hold up for the Grandfathers of Great Rock. Just masters at what they do. Dont over analyze this. Put some good headphones on and just rock away.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|The headline of my review says it all: Black Sabbath is BACK!!Yes, the bastions of dark heavy blues metal are back, and better than ever expected! Now, first off let me state that I've been a huge fan of Black Sabbath ever since the early 70's, collecting every album that came out under the Sabbath moniker, from every incarnation of the band, and have loved every one of them in their each unique way. But, as anyone rightfully knows, there is and never will be anyone anywhere to compare with the original band, four unique talented individuals who took the world by storm and didn't let up - ever!<br /><br />Even when members started leaving the band, Sabbath as an entity soldiered on over the years, but as great as their output was during that period, there was always *something* missing - a certain ingredient that only the original band could cook up.<br /><br />And, honestly, I was opposed to the mere thought of the original band ever reuniting over the years. But when I heard \\"Reunion\\" a few years back, I was pleasantly surprised by how great and unique they sounded together after all these years. And, when I heard they were reuniting yet again last year, I was very against it, thinking that they were maybe too old, and maybe just needed to retire already. And especially when I heard that drummer Bill Ward wasn't going to be involved, I figured this was going to be a sad tired ordeal, trying to cash in on past glories.<br /><br />So, imagine my pleasant surprise when I started seeing and hearing samples from this disc popping up online a couple months back. But even then I was kind of hestitant to want to jump on any bandwagon (pardon the pun), and declare their glorious return. And even after I placed my order for a copy of the cd, I checked the samples here on Amazon, and between those and some of the negative reviews (from so-called alleged \\"fans\\", but I'll get to that in a minute), I started regretting my purchase, and even questioned if I may need to put in for a refund and return the disc as soon as it arrived.<br /><br />Well...the cd arrived yesterday, and once I put it in the player, I've yet to take it out. I've had it playing non-stop ever since yesterday, letting it play overnight, and am still listening to it right now. It's that good! Scratch that...it's that GREAT!<br /><br />Yes, I use the word \\"great\\", as well as awesome, dynamic, and out of this world, wow, and any other positive adjective I can think of. This is as if Sabbath went back in time and picked up where \\"Vol 4\\" left off, and started from there. And, I can't get over how Ozzy Osbourne sounds like his old self, you know, the guy who fronted Black Sabbath, and not the hairy ape-like creature that shot to fame over later years in a solo act that made me want to cringe at times. No, this is Ozzy-fkg-Osbourne, the front man for Black-fkg-Sabbath here!<br /><br />(This is so good, it's made me reappreciate Ozzy Osbourne as not only the Black Sabbath vocalist, but as a singer in general. And that's saying something, because for several years, I couldn't really stand Ozzy's solo stuff after \\"No Rest For The Wicked\\". But this marks a great return to form for all involved, especially Ozzy Osbourne!)<br /><br />And Iommi's guitar has never sounded better, making sounds that make me have goosebumps because it sounds so good. And so classic! And Geezer Butler is in fine form, his brilliant bass flourishes shining throughout the entire recording. And, ok, yes Bill Ward is not here, but you wouldn't know it from the cd. Brad Wilk (neat coincidence in that their names have the same initials) steps in and takes over, and sounds as if he was born to be a member of Black Sabbath.<br /><br />Blues, jazz, swing, dark moody metal, it's all here! And it makes me not only declare this the best album from Sabbath in decades, but probably their best ever. And it makes me reappreciate the earlier classic albums even more. (It also makes me wonder what \\"Born Again\\" would havesounded like if they had reunited then instead of them bringing in Ian Gillan. But that's another story all-together.)<br /><br />As for all the people on here claiming to be life-long Sabbath fans, yet giving this such low rating reviews, well, sorry, but it's time for you to hand over your fan card right now - you don't deserve to carry it any longer. Any true fans knows what this album symbolizes and signifies: the return of the greatest band in rock history!<br /><br />Yep, bands like Godsmack, Alice In Chains, Pearl Jam, and all the rest can just go home, retire, and sit down and cry, because their time is now over...the godfathers have returned to show them how it's done!<br />Black Sabbath are BACK! Enough said.<br />Get \\"13\\" now, and thank me later. You won't regret it!<br /><br />As you can guess, this comes HIGHLY recommended! Buy it, play it, and for god's sake, CRANK IT UP!<br /><br />Thank you!<br /><br />Randall Brooks<br />(author, \\"The Two Worlds of the Mind\\"sounded like if they had reunited then instead of them bringing in Ian Gillan. But that's another story all-together.)<br /><br />As for all the people on here claiming to be life-long Sabbath fans, yet giving this such low rating reviews, well, sorry, but it's time for you to hand over your fan card right now - you don't deserve to carry it any longer.

B00CW665VI|5.0|Definitely one of the best stories I have read this year.  Love Ms Chases ability to see into a male mind.  He is exactly how I would imagine egotistical good looking men would be.  Can't wait for more from this author.  I have gone to Ms Chase's website for a squiz to see if there is any more to come and was impressed with her From Drew's Desk stuff.<br /><br />If you are looking for a great laugh, this is the book for you.
B000JPRPAO|4.0|Watched it by people's recommendation, it's pretty good but I probably not that much fan of it. Good movie .
B00A8ECU24|1.0|It is very fun at the beginning but as you advance you have to start using real money as to I dont have any. And come?

B00AREIAI8|5.0|very good app never run out of things to do. Cool graphics would recommend to any one grooming horses..... gems
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is the greatest book I have ever read. It has suspense and humor and fun in it I really loved it
B008EQIEWS|4.0|Love Sam Worthington.  Plot is a little boring though.  Ir is almost like somebody wrote the plot in about an hour and they started filming it without making sure it actually made sense.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love mincraft because you get to. do building. it has zombies and creepers it's. fun. andi like every thing
159102594X|4.0|It was a fun book, lots of blood and the f**** word was thrown around a bit so that was nice.
030746363X|5.0|Lots of good information.  Learn to sleep less, eat healthier and work out smarter.  Author is brilliant and the text is great.
B00CU8OVIM|4.0|I'm a J. Cole fan.  I liked The Come Up.  I loved the Warm Up.  How could you not love Friday Night Lights?<br /><br />I was disappointed by his debut album, especially the lead single (and, apparently, so was Nas, but that's another story).<br /><br />This is just a better album.  Lyrically, it feels like he had more time to develop his thoughts.  I remember thinking that actual verses sounded disjointed on Sideline Story.  That's not the case here.  His production stepped way up.  Much like his colleague, Kendrick Lamar, he managed to to find that balance between hip-hop credible and commercially accessible.  It's a damn good album.<br /><br />My complaint is that, as a Cole fan, I always hear the the songs that should have been on the album (Cole Summer anybody?) instead of some of the subpar tracks that made it (Ain't That Some $#!T anybody?).<br /><br />Overall, great album.  It's definitely worth the purchase.
B008M7JODC|5.0|I can't believe I missed this when it was on. Such a well plotted, well acted, well written, show.  It's le a combo Law and Order and X-Files, only better.  And for scifi geeks, there are so many references and nods to other shows in the genre it's fun trying to get them all.
B0000630BT|5.0|This is one of the best moments from the great legendary JUDAS PRIEST!!!!!!!!!! All the songs are high lights, but the title track must be one of the TOP 5 BEST METAL SONGS EVER!!!!!! PAINKILLER, SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE and BRITISH STEEL are AMAZING CLASSICS!!!!!!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DF0POXA|1.0|I can not believe that a)Kanye is still making music and b)that people actually listen to this.  I gave it a listen and I was reminded about how much he has no talent.  Get off your high horse Kanye and get a job as a roofer.
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|My 4 year old Mr. Fix it can really enjoy himself here.  All the characters you already know, new situations.
B005ZHBA9I|5.0|I don't think I've met a Twilight soundtrack or score yet that I didn't love.  This replaced the original Twilight score soundtrack as my &#34;fall asleep&#34; music.<br />Really nice that they brought the first score's composer back to book-end the score series.
B00BR0SGN0|4.0|My husband is an ole fan and he loves this for his B-Day gift from us!! He had ran off a mountain on his four wheeler drop 100 foot and is in bad shape ,so this cd helps his pain a little bit by listening to it. Thanks RUSH!!
B009AMANH4|5.0|I enjoyed everyting about this film.  Watching Daniel Day-Lewis you'd think it was actually Lincoln.  I also enjoyed Sally Field in her role as Lincoln's wife.
B00BFBSV72|4.0|Reminds me of the old sonic on sega game counsel. My son loves it and plays it all the time
B007HACDLK|5.0|I will sorely miss Vince Flynn's action filled novels. He has always delivered an exciting story and interesting surroundings around each of his stories. I have been a fan of him and his characters.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|Nice graphics, nice music, familiar characters.  Our 4 year old son will ask if bananas really grow on trees, etc... Nice thought provoking concepts.
B00BU18U82|5.0|My two boys love this simulator.  They are 11 and 15 years old.  They have loved watching tractors since they were just babies.  They keep telling me thank you for letting them download this.  They actually &#34;play nice&#34; a lot more now.  They thoroughly enjoy it-and so do I!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Imaginative, insightful, captivating. The story of Ender Wiggin will hold you at the Ryder of your seat.also for any miles$ personnel, it very effectively discusses effective leadership styles and strategies.
B004K8WJ3Y|5.0|I like the older White Snake better than most of the newer stuff. When I heard this album, it was more polished than their older stuff but it has great guitar playing in it. For me a a really good album. I would recommend it.
B001NA6096|5.0|Not sure I thought any sequel could follow the second movie in this series but Before Midnight does it.  (I thought the second one, Before Sunset, was an almost perfect movie.)  It's such a delight to follow this couple ten years on:  this romantic but also living in the real world of work, kids and aging.  If you enjoyed the first two, you have to see this one.
B006YC74E8|5.0|I use this app a lot!  Love it!  I can do simple edits that make photos look great and its very easy.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|I think there is a little chef in all kids, my son likes the idea of blending his own drinks (and he's learned all the foods and fruits represented.... Green kiwi, cutting onions, frying eggs.... So many combinations)
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|There are many episodes that explore the characters in the show. The accents can be overcome by watching it with the captions on. The main character is American so no accent to deal with. This show is too good for me to include spoilers, but I especially liked episode 7 and 8 and will probably watch the entire series. True to European T.V. it's a little sexier than our shows, both with language and nudity, but i think it made the people real. Episode 1 will hook you...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I totally LOVE this app!!!! I mean, like it's the PERFECT thing for you if you're sitting around all day, have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO,,and are, obvious,bored. You start off with ten games, then you have to earn the rest of the games by getting coins, by playing the games.( You also start off with 50,000 coins!!! Awesome,right?!)HINT: PLAY THE SOCCER GAME, IT GETS YOU TONS OF COINS!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Who knows what you would do as a parent in this situation.  I've recommended this book to friends who are parents and also see that life is much more than black and white especially when dealing with your children.  Well written.
B000KIRT6A|4.0|This is a good pedal and sounds great. Behringer makes affordable guitar pedals and they do not sound bad at all. This is a recommendable item.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Both my 7-year old daughter and I love this game!  It requires some thought and is addictive the more you progress!  Great way to pass time!
B00BP29SAA|5.0|Bagging bulk food, selecting food from a list to put in a cart, using a fork lift (to stack boxes into a puzzle)- all fun stuff.  The same cast of characters in a fun and familiar environment.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I like how the main character swims against the current and surprises the viewer that she is not concerned or allows mainstream media to drive her behavior.  Well developed plot and characters.
B000SEI230|5.0|In my opinion Nicholas Sparks could do no wrong with this story. It captured me from the beginning and kept me through the end. I am forever in love with this story.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|Never required to read this in school, but thoroughly enjoyed this classic. Easy to read. Engaging story line. Learned something new too, about the bombing of Dresden.
B000060P79|5.0|It is a good album plus I like the band. this was a good purchase so i would recommend it.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|My 7-yearold daughter loves playing this on her Kindle Fire HD.  I like that it requires problem solving and analytic skills unlike some of the old mind-numbing games!
B003XRELGQ|5.0|A satire on society and its possible downfall, Cat's Cradle perfectly satirizes religion, science, and almost all social structures of its era. It is an amazing book that perfectly demonstrates Vonnegut's answer to the great question of, &#34;why are we here?&#34; This book has entered my must read list.
B009NY43NY|1.0|This book was poorly written  and rushed.  It didn't have the same feel like the others I come to love.  I met Charlaine Harris, 2 years ago & acted like she didn't want to be there.  I stopped following her on FB recently bc she has become obnoxious & rude to her fans.  She kept stating over and over how done she was with The Sookie Stackhouse Novels, and u will notice this in her last Sookie book.  Disappointed
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ware I like the best is that it changes every time them changes the seasons changes to so subay Surf is the best
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very interesting clues. Love the way you need to figure out what you need next. Not as easy as it looks but lets of fun when you finally get the clue.
0345529057|5.0|liking them better than the show.  and i love the show.  the books are long, but with such great flow they read faster than you'd think.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Love playing the game. Keep the updates coming! It keeps you coming back again and again! Would recommend to my friends!
B0085YOD1A|3.0|I just haven't found it all that useful.  Not sure why I need it on my phone so will likely uninstall.
0345803507|5.0|All 3 of the books were very good. The last book had a great ending and cant wait for the next book May 2014!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved everything about it -- especially the way it is so relatable. It is a great book for teens and really anyone. I am on my third time reading it. This is SUCH a great book; I love it!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|This series is good I like it.  I like to wear my three wolves one moon shirt when I watch Eureka!  I get Great ideas about how to improve my situation!!!
B005LAIHEA|3.0|The movie was too long and it showed all the funny parts in the previews. After we got thru watching it then it gave us the option of watching the rated or unrated versions.
B00C7KXUOE|4.0|I've found this show to be entertaining, and it prompted me to pick up the book &#34;Red Dragon&#34;, which presumably takes place sometime after the events depicted in this series.<br /><br />There's a few glaring problems.  In &#34;Red Dragon&#34; Will Graham describes his relationship with Hannibal Lectar and says they only met a couple of times, and that he had question Lectar as a person of interest in associated with a crime.  In the series, Lectar and Graham are depicted with a much closer relationship; confiding in each other as friends and working on investigations together.<br /><br />Also, some of the characters identities have changed significantly.  Most notably, Dr. Bloom and Freddie Lounds were both men in the book.  They've been depicted as women in this series.  With this twist, many of the motivations that drive the actions of Bloom and Lounds are quite a bit different.<br /><br />If you can get past these inconsistencies, or you've just never read or seen &#34;Red Dragon&#34;, then this is a pleaser.  Hannibal and Graham are both very interesting characters and well depicted.  They've got big shoes to fill following the performances of Anthony Hopkins and Edward Norton, but barring access to a time machine, I think the casting couldn't have been better.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have the Kindle fire HD and in order to play the audible read you need to have a connection to the internet.  Believe it or not there are places that do not have WI-FI available, yes I know that sounds crazy, but it is true!<br /><br />Or do you know of a way to have the audio without the WI-FI and I am just missing something?
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This is a gem. The kind of book that makes you smile the whole time you're reading it. Lighthearted, funny, with just enough mystery to keep you wondering. The world needs more of this kind of book.
B001EC2IT4|3.0|Good movie. Decent quality. But streaming to to the my iPad 3 was terrible. Had to resume the movie every 5-0 minutes--even after restarting the iPad multiple times.
B009X01C64|5.0|This is an excellent case.  Seems well made.  Really like the fact that you can use it vertically as well as horizontily. Have not had any instability issues with it. Rotates easily inside the case, has three positions to choose from for both vertically & horizontily. A little spendy, but worth it.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie was much better than I expected.It was good for anyone who watched it, no matter if you go to church or not you would appreciate this film. It was funny and heart breaking and every thing in between. I have watch it twice now and both times I laughed and cried.
B000W24QMY|5.0|So here's the deal, we all know how great Fellini was! Now I've a degree in history of italian cinema and I come from the very same town Fellini was from!! This is a true masterpiece! Totally recommended to Foreign languages lovers (movie it's mostly in Romagnolo dialect, which is a total blast for me), italian enthusiast or simply great cinema lovers! Don't miss out!!
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Numerous reviewers offer the story line (some more accurate than others) and the cast. A look at the film cover gives you that much, I need not repeat it.  Some reviewers seem to think this film would primarily appeal to older viewers but I disagree.  There are several common elements that anyone, regardless of age, can relate with.  What runs concurrent generationally is our ability to adapt to life transitions.  Our lives are continuously in a state of flux.  Our  environment changes, our relationships change, our bodies change.  What makes a successful life is how we learn to adapt to the changes around us and within ourselves.  Even those who are not of the \\"boomer\\" generation, have been forced to adjust to an unwelcome changes, a loss of some sort?  Who hasn't had to adapt to some change in one's sense of control?  Parents move to a new area, the children have no say in the matter, but they must adapt to a new school, make new friends, etc. Transitioning from middle school to high school comes with unfathomable bodily changes. What young adult has not lost a job, or the person they thought was the love of his or her life?  Some people engage in an overwhelming desire and expend tremendous effort to fight back or rebel against change.  Some adapt more easily with humor and understanding.  Maybe most of us come to acceptance more slowly over a period of time.  Each of these characters has a zest for life that we can appreciate whatever our age.
B005HED08I|5.0|I was really thrilled to see these available to Amazon Prime members. My son is just old enough to ask about the show and it has been nice being able to view a few at a time.
B009MYARIK|4.0|Takes a bit more time to get into than many of her other books, but worth the wait.  Not as many laugh-out-loud moments as I've had when reading \\"The Undomestic Goddess\\", \\"Remember Me\\" or a few others, but a great read all the same.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Loved this book and the added drama that was in it. The writer left as lot open for new stories or to continue this one....only time will tell.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I couldn't really play this game because it locked up my phone. I think it might have been fun if it had not locked up my phone for 30 sec for every 5 sec of play.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|I have always loved Michael as a singer and entertainer.  Loved watching his moon dancing and his video of Billie Jean.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This drives me nuts........I get a word count..  I love Dr. Who, I couldn't find anything I wanted to watch on my 9000 cable channels all devoted to nothing that interests me.....so I decided to rewatch the seasons of Dr. Who in order.........it is fun because I am old enough to have forgotten the beginning by the time we get to the end.<br />Enjoy
B000K7VHPU|5.0|I always thought this movie was great! I had it recorded on my DVR but lost it when I had to have it replaced. So I bought it from Amazon and now I have it forever. The storyline I think is fantastic and I just love Edward Norton. And I have always preferred full screen to wide screen and Amazon gave me the choice.
B0058W74UY|2.0|It didn't work for my kindle and I'm still trying to find a version of Adobe's Flash Player that is compatible. But you may find it useful.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|Once again Pollan brings new light to how and why we need to take note of what we consume!<br />thank you,  Brian
B00005QGAT|5.0|Love the song I Want to Rock With You.  I love the 70s music and all the disco type songs.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|This is more happiness for my 5 year old son during those boring times that only a video game will enliven.  Plus this one makes him think just a wee bit and that is always good.  And an even bigger plus - he is not shooting, bombing or otherwise killing anything and that is always good.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|Upon inspection of other's comments, positive and otherwise, led me to finally get this and absorb it.<br />My first listen was not technically the '1st', since I've got into 'Remember that Night' dvd; I conclude<br />that the naysayers are just too negative.<br /><br />The writing is good, the guitar playing is of course stellar.<br />I think Dave has increased his tone and overall tool palette to make his axes implement that of the lap steel for pitch<br />bends and much higher notes, which sounds amazing to me. The production is decent, but I was hoping for some<br />weirder modes of sonic explorations, but that's been done already by Floyd countless times.<br /><br />This is in my estimation a good solo album, not a Floyd record, though it 'competes' and has the same overall sound.<br />The last 4 tracks fizzle out however in the overall feel of the record's pulse, so the arrangement of tracks could have been altered.<br /> The title track is great, 'The Blue' is an amazing tune for me and might have been better placed in the middle or 6th on the list for a 'saved gem'.<br /><br />The packaging, the layout and all the rest is great. Especially finding out the great drummer Andy Newmark (from Waters' Pros and Cons, John Lennon's Double Fantasy, and much earlier with Sly and the Family Stone) plays on it. His skill on this follows suit minus any flash with the mellow, mature and easy going trip through what it may be like to zone out on our own 'islands', whatever that may look like. Cheers to Dave. Well done.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|A great source for all the classics. Highly recommend this one. Give it a shot. Very good source for tunes that you'll enjoy time and again.
B0099Y2YL6|4.0|Great picture quality. I rewatch this show just so I can see the detail in the sets and dress. ...and then there is the drama. Great show if you haven't seen it start at the beginning and just soak it all up.
B00CM7FLZ8|5.0|This game was recommended by a friend and it is awesome! Lots and lots of entertainment, play it every day.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I am really hoping the second movie comes out soon.  Guess I need to read the books.  Loved the whole idea of the movie.  My favorite alien type of movies are the ones with aliens that look like humans.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A nice little puzzle.  Each floor you have to find the clues, solve them to find the keys to the elevator.  This takes you to the next floor.  Each floor is a little harder to solve. Really it is a cute game.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Time and again a source for the downloads you use on a daily basis. Give it a try. Worth it.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|This artist always produces a polished product and I was not disappointed with this purchase.<br /><br />He is a very talented performer and can perform with the World's best , can recommend purchase of this cd
B004GJYROG|5.0|i have always loved this movie, and am very pleased i purchased it. it came quickly and was in over all great condition.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I really loved this movie.  It awesome seeing the story unfold while bouncing back from the past to the future and how it all tied into telling the story.
B003QNXPUK|1.0|The instalation is dificult, and they make it worst when the liquid include is just not enough, they have to know this but the seems to not care
B003H6KRIE|5.0|This set arrived in brand new condition and was exactly what I needed.  Bought as a gift for fathers day and was a big hit.
B008ACC9CM|5.0|After seeing these two new  outstanding performers on YouTube,  that a friend of mine from England sent to me , I could not wait to receive this first album that Jonathan and Charlotte produced.  &#34;Together&#34;<br /><br />  Even though Simon Cowell on the show called &#34;Britains Got Talent&#34;  said that &#34;Jonathan you have an outstanding voice!&#34; so too does Charlotte,  and adds a wonderful touch to the &#34;duo&#34; when they perform their singing together,  and if she was not on that cd I would not have bought it .  Jonathan needs Charlotte's backing,  for he would not be the same without her and he knows it!<br /><br />These two young folk have a very unique, brilliant future ahead of them,  and I for one will purchase any cd's or dvd's they care to produce.  I recommend any person who appreciates quality songs, sung with such professionalism,  and can appreciate English as well as Italian language being sung,  to buy their performance on cd's and any dvd's that maybe produced in the future.  To think Jonathan and Charlotte are but 17yrs old,  wow......  Think what the future has for the World  Just a brilliant first cd.  Well done both of you  Well done.
0345529057|5.0|The set of paperbacks arrived quickly.  It is a well made set.  I have almost finished the first book and I love it.  I recommend the books to anyone who wants great reading.  You will not be disappointed.  Good price too!!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is especially pertinent when we see how controlled our lives have become. This may be the future for those who still believe in individual liberties.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Ever since i heard they were giving information to the government without a warrant i am agsinst them i am going to start using bing.
0345803493|5.0|This book is a real page turner. I can't wait until I read part 3.  Hopefully someone will buy it for me to read.
B00821OX98|4.0|Great series to catch up when I caught the bug from Season 2! But the streaming was a little slow which may have caused by slow wi-fi in the house.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is the shiznyee and good game to play while your waiting on someone or something should definitely consider gettung the game
B0030V0PEW|5.0|One of the most interesting and practical books I have ever read. Extremely practical and useful material. I recommend it to all my undergraduate and graduate business students.
B0071XO8RA|1.0|This book was loooong and awful. It was a recommendation. It did not blow my mind whatsoever. It was predictable. It was so boring and tedious to read, it felt like a school assignment to get through. Just awful.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I like Nicholas Sparks books they are always very interesting to me. He is one of my favorite authors.<br />Thank you.<br />Patty Gall
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Way better than the last one, worth the dollar. Lots of features and I found no bugs. Cannot wait for another update!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Love the way it comes up when I plug in my kindle. With a glance I can see how it is charging up. This is well worth the money.
B008EKOO46|5.0|I chose this book because he is such a concise and patient writer, respectful of his readers. I love his writing style, so endearing in the ways he endeavours to make have a complete understanding of the topic.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|The beginning was good. The spousal abuse by a cop story line was interesting. The ending was too fantastical for reality and left me disappointed with the book.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Sometimes I'm stuck at airports with no wifi.  This game is perfect for those times.  A fun game and gets very challenging.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game keeps my very active boys 4 and 9 from biting each others head off during long car rides.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Awesome series.  Can't wait to watch the next few seasons on my Kindle.  This has become my favorite online series.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The calculator does its job flawlessly, and for that I give it 5 stars.  The best part is that it is free!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|This is a very fun item, It has a lot of cool features, and its fun to act as if you were The Doctor himself with this sonic screwdriver. The UV light and ink nib are fun to use when you want to amaze people
B008X9Z37A|4.0|This case is very nice, and fits the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; perfectly with clips for all four corners so the Kindle is very safe in this case.  It's great for traveling.  I would have rated it 5 stars, until I tried out another case that sits on it's own, and you can sit and watch TV, movies, or read and eat at the same time.  Sometimes I need just the case, like for reading in a passenger capacity.
0062255657|5.0|When I heard The Ocean at the End of the Lane described as a &#34;modern fairy tale&#34;, I was skeptical, because honestly that usually means (in my opinion), you're going to wind up with something like Artemis Fowl. Which this very much is not.<br />Like every other book Gaiman writes, this is different from every book he's written before - it's smart, it's thrilling, and it's even a little scary. I read it in two sittings (I could have finished it in one, if I hadn't started four hours after I needed to be asleep).<br />If you've liked anything that Gaiman has written to date, go and buy this book. It's just so good!
B003G4W49C|4.0|I didn't catch on to the underlying &#34;twist&#34; until the end, as you are supposed to. Are some of the views about ethnic groups those of Card, or just the character of Ender? Well written, a classic of science fiction themes.
B00D6BU8GG|4.0|If you count vehicles wrecked and bullets shot, as well as explosions, then you definitely get your money's worth. Add to that a not too unbelievable plot, and the McClain family legacy growing even more, then you've got something very entertaining.  Hardest thing to figure was when he'd say Yippee-Kay-Yay...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|100% addictive, I often find myself watching way more episodes than I had planned because of the cliff hangers setup at the end of each episode! Love it, can't wait for season four!
B009J2VQSK|3.0|Some of the good songs that I remember from the movie were left out of this album, but at least the price was right.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|what intrigued us was it was based on a real story - the acting was excellent - told a story of an issue I wouldn't have normally ever thought about
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|I knew guy's like that I'm my old neighborhood, City Line .<br />But, you think they got it made, &#34;they&#34; get it in the end.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great sci-fi adventure and action book. One of those books you find yourself reading late into the night and only put down because  you've nodded off. Or because the battery in the kindle gave out.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|Setterfield's story is a sweeping tale of sisters. love, Gothic nightmares, and ghosts from the past. A dying writer, Vida Winter calls upon a woman she has never met to tell her final story. Hence the title. This final story is the narrative of Vida's family. Winter digs deep into the past, into her darkest memories, to recount the horrific and bizarre events of the Angelfield family. Setterfield's descriptions of the mysterious and frightening moors harkens back to the tradition of the Brontë sisters. Her emotional landscapes are intense, haunting, and disturbing. She captures that Gothic sense of universality, devoid of time and place, that haunts the ages.<br /><br />If You Like: the Brontë sisters, Henry James
B00D3V97DO|5.0|At first I was skeptical about the album since Bill Ward isn't part of the recording, but after hearing the release I'm amazed at how true to the original Sabbath this album sounds. It fits in with the Ozzy era Sabbath as if 30+ years never went by. Great lyrics, great song structures, and no - nonsense production. This is one of my favorite albums in many years. Even Bill Ward would have to agree.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|I enjoyed this as much as I've enjoyed the die hard series - same kind of non stop action adventure
B00CISC2DA|5.0|I've patiently purchased every BOC release since the beginning; waiting on the one that would absolutely blow me away.  This is that album!  I'm not ready to say that it's better than Tokyo by Marconi Union or Moon Safari by Air, but its clearly in the conversation.  I love albums that transport you to a certain place and time, and this release accomplishes that effortlessly.  Easily one of the most tightly conceived electronic albums of all times; even the album art and packaging support the concept perfectly...BOC really paid attention to the details.  Take a chance on this album, it does not disappoint!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Once again Khaled Hasseini invites us into lives in Afghanistan and weaves a fascinating tale.  Fabulous reading while we painlessly get better acquainted with an area of the world so foreign to us.  It's so nice to sit down with a book that is so well written!
B001NLKXK2|4.0|My mother has been diagnosed with Alzheimers, and although she is not as young as Alice, it was fascinating and frightening to learn what is going on in the Alzheimer's victim's brain.  Because it is a novel, I was able to get to know Alice and imagine what she was going through, unlike reading about the progression of Alzeheimer's disease by reading a medical journal.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Good sequel to Fall of Giants.  I look forward to book three of the Follett Century Trilogy with great anticipation.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|the die hard series to me just never disappoints - all I am looking for is a fast paced action packed escape movie -
B008602KQI|5.0|It is among one of the best movies that I have watched so far. It has so many messages to the world and the main characters played very nicely. This is also a very high tech movie.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Dance with Dragons got off to a good start and quickly faded as I continued reading. Around half way through I actually stopped reading it for a nearly a year because I was just so bored of it. Now that I have started it back up, It's quickly picked back up and it's surprisingly starting to become good again. I still feel that GRRM and his editor could have easily taken out another 100+ pages though. There are far too many filler pages that offer nothing to the book and they made it needlessly long in my opinion. Still, It's a pretty solid read but no where near worth the wait.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|Use it for tracking my individual stocks and following bond market. Easy to get started. I would recommend it to anyone who wants quick access.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Great blending of fictional characters with actual historical figures in a set of intertwined stories that keep you moving through the book.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|as long as you don't take it too seriously - it is a comic book - good fun, good cgi - worth the watch
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|its birding I don't like it all u have to do is place weird dinosaur in a selected place and u lose money because it deletes all ur data with dinosaur and when u press play a real dinosaur comes out to life and eats u up!!!!!
B001UTW7QU|4.0|With Amazon Prime Instant Video you can watch several series without having to deal with commercials.  It is a great way to see it you enjoy a show before renting or purchasing it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I gobbled down all 5 seasons as quickly as I could. Well written, directed and acted. This alone justified my amazon prime account.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|Pretty average.  Some of the actors--like Anna Kendrick--I really liked, but the writing was predictable, almost painful in forcing the disparate plotlines to intertwine.  And out of all those people who were having children, only ONE \\"average\\" looking person (and he was a joke--he'd been on a weight-loss reality show and had a super-hot-competitive dad).  Sorry, but I can't get choked up about anything to do with Jennifer Lopez.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This is a great show with an incredible cast. There are so many famous talent that appear on this show it makes every episode great!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|If you like games with action this is the game.It has lasers and mashins and more this game is a hit
B000002GJH|5.0|I love this cd. I heard it over FB. I hope to hear more of their songs. Great music, don't miss this one.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I only give it three stars b/c the whole concern for Peeta becomes really annoying.  I suppose I will find out why after reading the final book.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Both myself and my family loved this movie.  It was very inspiring!  Wish there were more movies like this that the whole family can watch.
B0094KTA4Y|5.0|this is a great little movie.  it is very entertaining and the animation is wonderful.  this is a cute story and has several good lessons.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|It was a fun game but short.  You don't need to read the rules you can just start playing the game.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Wow. Powerful story that makes for one of those wonderful books that stays with the reader for a good long while. Heartbreaking, beautiful, hilarious, sad, honest, and thought-provoking. Absolutely a 5 star read for me.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I put off reading this until a friend recommended it; I'm glad she did because the story, totally amazing, has stuck with me and the pure adventure of reading it was a joy.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book bridges  the medical-scientific world and the energy-spiritual one. It should be put in the hands of the most skeptical people. It is clear, easy to read, no non-sense. To spread around as much as possible. The audiobook is really great to listen to too. Eben Alexander is one of the person you want to sit down with and share a really meaningful conversation.
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|I am very pleased with this purchase. I love paramore and listen to all their other music and this CD was just as good. I would recommend this CD to paramore fans.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|The reason I gave this movie a 4-star is because of the plot line, it's great but it gets kind of dumb. This movie is probably best to stay away from kids, has a lot of profanity, and some drug use. But when this movie came out I was excited, it's great and I love Seth McFarlane, probably one of his greatest works! I would absolutely recommend anyone reading this to watch it. And if you love family guy, American dad, Cleveland show and what ever else Seth made, I require you to watch this. Don't think twice order or buy it NOW!:)
0385344228|2.0|Not my type of enjoyable read but I plugged thru it for book club. Fast paced writing and happy to have it finished. Bad seed all round was this one. If you've seen the movie, The Bad Seed, from the 50s then this story will sound familiar - can there be such a thing as the 'murder gene'? The more I thought about this book as a whole, the more it echoed that movie which is a classic and very good.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved the book. Learning about the people of Afghanistan was never on my bucket list, but Hosseini has pulled me into new ventures with his moving stories and evocative writing. It is a blessing to learn to care about a people and their country. Hosseini's two earlier books were so good; this one, too.
B002EDH0FE|3.0|But no cigar, IMHO. I haven't read the graphic novel, which I understand is far better. However, for scifi fans, it has a somewhat interesting premise & fun special effects. I like best Rorschach's extremely cool mask. In itself worth the price of admission.
0399255567|5.0|Entertaining story about a butterfly's life.  Our grand children thoroughly enjoyed reading this story with all its colorful pictures throughout the book.
B003QNXPUK|1.0|This product ruined my entire day. It was a nice day: I saw my mother, had lunch with her and my boyfriend and got much-needed cleaning done in the apartment. Then I tried to put this screen protector on my iPhone 4S. Now I'm filled with an unquenchable rage. From the ridiculous liquid the instructions directed me to spray all over the protector to the poorly-designed cutouts that did not align with my phone's home button and camera this thing combines the subtle design of Rube Goldberg and the sterling quality of a 1979 Datsun. In fact, if Rube Goldberg had reworked a 1979 Datsun, it probably would have held up better than this useless absurdity, which peeled off whenever I tried to put my phone's cover back on. At the first possible opportunity, I'll be taking this back to the store where I bought it and demanding a full refund. If I thought I could get them to compensate me for the time I spent trying to put it on the phone, I'd be asking for that, too, because, really, I deserve it. I give this item a star only because no stars doesn't seem to be an option. I would not buy again, would not recommend to a friend. Might recommend to sworn enemy, if he really pissed me off.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|It is easy to place all items in bag and still has so many compartments yo add more items comfortably
B00CKZX0AA|4.0|At first I was not impressed but it has grown on me. I like it a lot now. It makes me want to see the movie.
B00D6M86RS|5.0|I love this app. I'll eventually end up with all the tables, I think. Great graphics, great gameplay, and definitely a great value!
1608871819|4.0|I really loved the quality of this book.<br />For a Superman fan is a must have.<br /><br />I don't follow other super heroes, so I can't compare.<br />I think I expected to see more of the set and behind the scenes pictures, and the thing is that most of the pictures in it I'd already seen them. But I really enjoyed the interviews.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|Not sure why this didn't do better at the box office.  I really liked it, I have watched it twice now.  It's the simple version we all remember from childhood, but it's now grown up.  The actors were really good, and the CGI was terrific, good revamped story.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|If you liked part 1 i think you'll love part 2. Again the animation is great and I love the Joker music in this one, it's just amazing movie
B00CI5ET7K|5.0|Another awesome album from Joe. He just keeps getting better. His musical style is unique and he is always rockin' with the best.
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|It was beautiful, ambitious, and extremely difficult to follow. While I appreciate what they were trying to do I got pretty bored and more than a little confused. More than anything though, in the end in just wasn't that wowed.
B008VO3PA4|5.0|I'm sure my cats wrote some of these poems. I enjoyed it immensely and only wish there was more to read.
B0087IT8LO|5.0|When I first went to see this movie in theatres, I was less than excited but the prospect of it but my girlfriend wanted to see it so there I was.  The movie itself is just so funny and touching and emotional that it should stand as the milestone that other movies try to reach.  I've told everyone I know to watch this movie.  Even my dad, whose idea of culture is Nascar and who tried to walk away after discovering the movie was all in French with subtitles loved it and bought a copy himself.  This is a movie that people from all walks of life will find enjoyable and I cannot find a single bad thing to say about it.  This movie should be a classic that our children's children will watch.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was very well written. I was drawn into the characters lives and found myself interested in what happened to them. The premise is just plain fun. This is a great beach book.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This is the best game ever since the zoo app about rescuing all of the animals and keeping them not become extinct.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|I've read everything I can find about procrastination, self-discipline and changing an unwanted habit, including The Power of Habits by Duhigg.  Duhigg's book is better than most, but I give it C+ for how helpful it was to me.  I didn't think I'd find anything new on the topic, but Willpower Instinct is a cutting-edge research-based book and a real eye-opener.  What's more, it is actually practical and very, very helpful.  It goes far beyond the usual (which is make lists, prioritize, reward small steps, figure out what is motivating your unwanted behavior and find a more desirable way to meet that need - all of which one needs willpower to do).  I've sent Willpower Instinct to my sister and she loved it also. I wish I could take the author's course.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great app for an amazing website. Easy to access on the Kindle :) Love the layout and that it was free
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game this game is awesome I'm trying to be the best out of my facebook friends. It is good people should try this awesome game it teaches you skills and you can win people or buy them.
B00CATSONE|3.0|This book isn't really about Tesla, it's about what makes a genius. And it doesn't provide an answer on that. However, I didn't know much about J P Morgan and his dealings with Thomas Edison as they related to Tesla so the book was worth reading.
0375850864|5.0|It took about half the book before I got sucked in but once I was, wow, this is a great book.<br />If you haven't read A Wrinkle in Time yet, be sure you do before reading this book and all the little references will make more sense.  Or if you haven't read it since you were a kid, go back and reread Wrinkle in Time so all the references are fresh in your mind.<br />The reviews and the awards are all right: this is a great book and is worth picking up a copy.
B00499DU2S|4.0|Newer sound is great but has fallen away from their Math Metal sound of earlier days. I prefer puzzle or Opposites to this album, but still love it
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Fun, but time consuming. Cute plants, you dont have to buy anything to actually have fun and play the game
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I loved this book but it almost dragged on for too long. Maybe it is just because I was so in love with Augustus`s character that when he passed I was so bored. But I would recommend this.
B000PDYVVG|4.0|So I saw that the reviews were mixed.  A good friend said they thought I would like it so I figured what the heck. I picked this book up and started reading it to find that I was hooked from the first two chapters. I like memoirs so this book was right up my alley. If you don't like memoirs, this is not the book for you.
B00001QEE7|5.0|product is worth the money due to little mermaid being a excellent classic Disney movie.  good sound and picture. all in all a good buy
B009AWRF9I|5.0|Great idea for the band to go on and it really sounds amazing all around. More heavy like their older music, with a few sweet tunes thrown in like Only Revolutions had. Loving it!
0525478817|2.0|The kindest thing I can say about this book is that I was not its intended audience.  I have always been confused about the distinction between fiction and young adult fiction, but make no mistake--The Fault in Our Stars is a young adult book.  For me, this formulaic Cancer Story was a bit too contrived.  Is it possible that a teenage girl with cancer would be insightful and philosophical?  Totally.  But would she meet a drop-dead gorgeous, funny, smart, equally-insightful and philosophical teenage guy with cancer who immediately falls in love with her?  Probably not.  I believe Hazel and Augustus would call the success of this highly-predictable book a Cancer Perk.  While I can see why other people LOVE this book, it just wasn't the book for me.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Another amazing season of AHS! I sat and watched every episode in one sitting after downloading.  I found it intense and engaging, full of cliffhangers and surprises.  It is a completely different storyline from last season, but with many of the cast of last season reappearing in different interesting roles.  The acting was superb, giving me chills, making me angry, sad, or horrified all at the right times.  This time the story takes place in a mental asylum full of dark secrets :)
B000002MX7|5.0|chaka khan is a music queen. i've been listening to her my whole life.  she never goes out of style.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Very good and emotional!<br />Great book and ending! Many will enjoy! Thank you Lois lowry! Loved it every minute! Must read!
B009CYI9ZS|5.0|I felt it ranked in better than Sawdust or Day & Age, beginning to return to the roots of Hot Fuss and Sam's Town
B004SUWR2C|3.0|The exact game as in my iPhone, so no new updates.<br /><br />I like the game in 1-player mode, however it's difficult for the another player not to see your deck when using the multi-player mode.
1476733953|4.0|I purchased the E copy Omnibus after reading the first one for free.  My buddies encouraged me to read it and I thought the first \\"book\\" was a tease.  How couldn't I read more.  I've told a lot of people about the book but couldn't give it 5 stars for a few downsides, similar and seemingly inconsistent characters, and repetition that bordered on the tedious.<br /><br />First, characters: I enjoy how each current character seemingly introduces the next character.  However either their perception isn't true or every character always expresses similar emotions, thoughts, and processing.  Even those in control seem to lose their grip, Bernard for instance, when he's portrayed as a thoughtful, more meticulous character.  I wanted true differences that led to distinct thought patterns.  Admittedly that is very hard to write.<br /><br />Secondly, I found certain aspects of the character development repetitious.  I was frustrated by the similar language to describe the relationships for each one.  The same phrase seemed repeated many times.  I know it's a plot link that the canteens were not only shared but one for the other, however the reminder that it is romantic was telling me too much.  I know it's romantic.  Maybe you can tell me once but any more than that and my mind disengages from discovering in the story and instead I just receive information.  I want to discover it.  I wish movies were like this, too - be subtle! Let us pick up on it or miss it and be surprised on the second read.  Of course this determines your target audience, too.  I skipped paragraphs describing what I'll call Knox's crusade and glad I did.  I'm not sure how one should treat that and I know it's part of the story but I don't being wrapped up in a character that lasts two chapters.  On the positive side I definitely felt the palpable sense of chaos there.<br /><br />Third, the conclusions were not really conclusions as much a segues into another intrigue.  I enjoy that about continuing stories but I missed the climaxes in many instances, though some were ideal.  Maybe it's because it was my first digital read but I was always shocked to see the end of the story or the book.  It crept up on me and I wasn't prepared for the end.  With wool I believe the ride down from the final climax was there and I liked that but it seemed lacking in the individual books (and more so in Shift).<br /><br />Other than these minor qualms it's the best sci-fi book I've read since Alfred Bester and a great engaging story.  I've recommended it everyone I know and even to people in the waiting room at the ENT when I see them reading other fiction.  Good work and I look forward to more.  Take time to think differently and have your characters think differently - be dynamic.
B00006EXDM|5.0|this is a really great compilation of the stones.  it has all of my favorites so i'm very happy with this purchase.
B001DJ7PR8|3.0|I choose 3 stars for this movie because first I rate 2 stars for this story and 3rd star for the view of places in Barcelona.<br /><br />I liked the idea of the country it looks very nice and lively, I can't say dislike because the idea of the story requires to add something new but I consider as a normal story nothing special but there is some adding to make it interesting.<br /><br />I recommend it to those whom like to watch countryside movies and also strange kind of relationship between 3 stars!<br /><br />But I find it nice for the first watch.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Great book!  Leaves you wondering at the end, &#34;what really happened&#34;.  Movie follows the book pretty closely.  Was suggested by friends.
B006M4F67A|4.0|24/7 Mahjong is a matching game.  The symbols are a bit small, but overall, I enjoy it. The level of difficulty increases, and there is a reshuffle option if you get stuck.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|I have always loved this movie. It is sooo underrated. Such a funny & sweet movie that my entire family enjoys...even my teens! We are constantly repeating one liners from this film! How can you dislike a movie with Christopher Walken, Sissy Spacek, & Brendan Fraser? Each one of them is seamless. Spacek is perfection! Just watching her character change in this film...hilarious!  Walken is as perfectly quirky as ever.  Fraser is simply charming! He plays a man who is really more like a naive boy and he doesn't play it silly.  He plays it with so much warmth and charm that you can't help but fall in love with him!  Alicia Silverstone is as adorable as she was in Clueless...oh, and Dave Foley is so funny without being a caricature. If you want a feel good, funny, light movie with a lot of heart, watch this one, I don't think you will be disappointed.
B002ECN4P0|5.0|this is a great compilation of all my favorites.  i am very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I am a huge animator! And this movie I watched with my dad and older brother who are not fans of anime. By the end of the film they were both speechless saying how good it was - hell we are watching right now again!! A must buy. Note it is a little gory. Still ridiculously good.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I enjoyed the book but was over joyed that he realized what real love is.  Not being into hurtful games but a loving and nuturing relationship.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Really good app. Not really good- amazingly greatest goodest bestest app in the WHOLE WORLD!!!!! Get it! Very highly recommended!!
030789701X|5.0|I bought this for my husband and he loved it! Great gift for anyone who enjoys the Skyrim video game!
B000FBJHZS|4.0|The suspense is really good, and as always, Brown's creativity is amazing.  Characters lack a little believability and depth, however.
0345803485|2.0|Must I say more? I could compare this book to the poorly written Twilight series, but I'm not going to, because I feel there are already pages of reviews doing so. This book sucks.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest, so this app makes it easy to see my pins and other people's pins when I'm away from the computer.<br />I can quickly show my family members and friends something I though they might like, without digging through the internet app.<br /><br />For some reason, I like Pinterest better on my new android.<br />On my iPhone it wasn't as nice to use. It just probably got updated in between during my switch.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is a fun horse lover game I enjoy this game and u will to if u take the time to download
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved playing this game as it kept me hooked. The only thing is it sort of lags at times (but only shorthly) when I play the game and at times prevents me from moving the way I want the person to move.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|What bothered me was that in this novel, Clancy seemed to forget that the US has lots of stealth aircraft, thus F/A 18's took the leading role in battling the Chicoms.  Kind of unrealistic in that respect.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very good game.nice game to pass the time when you are waiting for something or someone..I will use it at the airport while I wait for the plane.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've tried a few different Bible apps and this one is the fastest to find a verse I want.<br />This is especially helpful when searching for a verse in church.<br /><br />It has many versions available and the layout is simple and uncomplicated to use.<br />Highly recommend!
B005HSL626|4.0|I used to have this app on my phone and it is so much better on the kindle!  Keeps me from being bored on my breaks at work!
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I thought this product was good but the only thing was the shuffle on this app kept repeating the songs I had on my device in that order.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I am Cuban and I left my country when I was 9.  There were many relatives I never saw again, many stories lost.  This book speaks to the sadness of loss and to the wonders of love and family.  It also reminds us how fragile our realities are and how much we don't know.
B00C7DGRL4|2.0|Really thought this was going to be a better movie!  From the overacting, over use of cuss words(and I have a mouth of a sailor) just for the &#34;coolness factor&#34;, it's a total disappointment!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I really like this app--you get a lot for the fact that you don't even have to pay for any of it. There are lots of different sounds that you can fall asleep to, and you can use any combination of the sounds that you want, while also controlling the volume of each noise. In addition, there is also a timer, so that, if you want, the app will shut itself off after a certain amount of time. Overall, a great app--the best for your money (or lack of it) out there!! :)<br />..
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is the last in a series of novels about Mich Rapp, by Vince Flynn.  I have read each and every one.  Loved every minute doing it.  Am looking forward to any new books he may write, with anticipation.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Starts slow but by the middle I was hooked. Beautifully written.<br />A good and honest look at the Holocaust. Well worth it.
B00ATUEKY8|5.0|I had never heard of Sylvia Plath before reading this book. Great insight into mental illness. Am following up on other books and movies about the author.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I've loved Miyazakis films since childhood times I've been entertained and this movie is like one of my favorites along with Totoro. I plan on getting more gibli films the stories are just all remarkable.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I cannot wait to see the movie! I loved this book! Kept me reading....I did not want to put it down!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Love it.  Laws of physics apply, you can use the torque wisely or you can flip over and break your neck. All vehicles behave differently (different weight, dif engines, some are AWD, some not), the surfaces are different - try the RWD race car on Arctic and you'll see what I mean. :)  You learn tricks like jumps (air time) and flips.  Even in the air, the car can be controlled using gas and brake.  In a word - fun!
B00321GTJU|5.0|I bought the Planet Earth videos to stream and was not disappointed.  I'd heard good things about it (it's won Emmys) and it totally lived up to my expectations.  I have a 6 year old and a 5 year old and I bought this so I could base some activities on it over the summer.  It kept them (and myself) entertained and gave me a lot of material to work with.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|FANTASTIC SHOW that's it period. watch it no matter what anyone says. This show has some great story lines. GREAT
B0026QC0TA|4.0|This was actually better than I thought it would be. Damon and DeVito are great together. The rest of the cast is really solid as well.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|Wonderful score that stands on its own even if you have not seen the show. Cyndi Lauper hit it out of the part with this and the Tony was well deserved.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I am older, and not a gamer, and have played few games on my phone or kindle, however I am using them because it is good for the brain. It's lots of fun, and challenging for me.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Just as good as the computer game ,like it nice, companion while in the hospital made time go faster. Get it it's good
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|The black and white portion was better than the color portion.  Should be some kind of rule that works derived from classics should be better than this one was.
B0091X2K0A|5.0|Clever and entertaining look from boot camp to battle, this authentic movie captures a grunts eye view of battle in Vietnam.  The opening 30 minutes are humorous, and show the essence of boot camp with a motivated drill instructor.  As the movie progresses, the conflict in Vietnam comes into view as the no-win situation it was, and this movie captures it perfectly!
B009JZWYKQ|5.0|Great movie, top notch cast, well written. Pulls you in right from the start. One of Tarantino's better efforts. Clooney plays a great straight man!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like this game. I like the challenges for each round. would like to have more clues to find on each level. this is a hard game to put down. enjoy playing.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|I love the ongoing story-line and character development.  Outside the box thinking makes many episodes thought provoking.  This season was very fun to watch!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have a regular Kindle and enjoy using it.  My tablet just adds more versatility and use and not having to transport two items.
B0074D3CAQ|2.0|This was a selection for our book club.  The woman who chose it thought it would be an easy and friendly read and that all in our group would enjoy it. She had not read the book prior to selecting it but rather had relied on the reviews she had read.  I finished the book before she did and realized that one of our members, a woman who had lost a child to a drug overdose/suicide, was going to be blindsided by the tragedy the book details.  This is an immensely sad book about loss and aging and failed relationships.  Readers be warned.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|How great is it to be able to watch as much downton as you want at your leisure?  it's so good, i can watch over and over...
B000NY12LO|4.0|This was a really good book!!  Not one of the best books written by Picoult, but I really enjoyed it!!
B000FC0ZEO|5.0|I already have this book in paperback but I bought it for Kindle because I wanted to have it wherever I wentI know I am invested because I've already read all of the Farseer booksthey thought it was a great book to finish the seriesI just hope she comes out with more
B008M721MS|5.0|I never thought I would admit it, but now that I have one and have played with it for a bit; yah! Another wonderful and fun toy. Thanks, best little all purpose pad out there!
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I used to play Final Fantasy Tactics all the time when I was a kid now I get to be a big kid which is fun, the game is cool the graphics are old school but cool and it is fun to try and figure out which spells are the best for defeating monsters.  I am really enjoying it, and sometimes the challenge is to figure out where to go but there are so many places to discover that I found it enjoyable.  Whether you have only a few minutes or several hours its a good stop and go game, if you are out wandering its very likely you will have a fight on your hands, which can be really fun.  Turn based action allows you to think about your next move and there is always that thrill of satisfaction when you get a BIG hit in.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|From the beginning as the music starts I get excited to watch this show. The characters are very well written. You have characters that you love and ones that you despise. Downton Abbey takes you to an era that you wish you could've been a part of.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|This a great story of tragedy, human resiliency, and human compassion. Seems tragedy allows human compassion to rise to the surface despite language or cultural differences...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this room escape game. tricky enough to keep me guessing but not too hard to loose my interest
0425263924|5.0|I like that Eva and Gideon are heading in a good direction. Now that Eva is moving in the right direction she can help more Gideon confront his demons, maybe help Cary too. I hope to see more of Gideon relationship with his Mother, they both need to go to therepy together like Eva and Monica. I happy that there is a 4th and 5th book. A relationship like Gideon and Eva's need more than 3 books.
B008602KQI|5.0|Love this movie!!  Shipping was great too!  Highly recommend to anyone.  Can hardly wait for November to get here so I can see the next one!
B00BBW16HW|5.0|I loved this movie. The idea that people radically different from each other can be a blessing to the other is an idea that it worth conveying!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Everything was outstanding but I may have missed how Bond survived the opening train sequence where he was supossedly shot and fell off the train into a river. Otherwise good and somewhat plausible.
193700788X|2.0|Love the series since the beginning. love Sookie how strong she was.She went through something things that would change a person for the good or for bad, with her it was kind of in the middle. I knw she was tired of her gift and everything but God she whine toward the end:/ It was all about herself:&#34;Why is Sam not talking to me&#34; &#34;I'm so alone then too many people in my house, can't they go away&#34; &#34;I'm tired of looking at Tara's baby photos&#34; &#34;I love Eric but he's a vampire&#34; I need a tan, look how good my tan is?&#34; And I felt she wasn't a good friend to Amelia. Sure Amelia sometimes talks too much but she doesn't do it to be mean. But Sookie took it like a betrayal and Amelia was trying to mend things. Sookie blares out &#34;oh ur pregnant, oops u didnt know sorry&#34; in front of everyone. It look like she didn't care. I felt bad for poor Eric it seem everything that everything end it bad for him and he still love Sookie. Almost everyone was against him. I bought the book just to finish the series. Dissapoint how Sookie didn't become more stronger like some other heroines in other stories.
1616550414|5.0|I don't even have words to express how much I love this book. Any hard core legend of Zelda fan should have this in their collection and if you don't but have the money for it you should!
B0094K1PW4|4.0|I like d the movie but you have to like this type of stuff. It wll not be life changing..lol
B00006FM77|3.0|If you like every aspect of Chicago, and cant get enough of every detail about them, then this CD is for you.  It presents a multi day live show featuring Chicago and only Chicago-noone else shares any concert time with them.  The result?  An overlong CD with overlong performances that go on and on, seemingly forever. A much better live showing of Chicago is on U-Tube, dating from earlier days for the group. The filming is not the best but the presentation far outweighs what's contained on this group of CD's. Again, if you are consumed by Chicago, buy the CD. If not, skip it and look up the live concert on U-Tube.
B007REV4T8|4.0|My father and I would watch all the old Bond movies.  Bought this for my son and now he an i are going back and watching the older bond movies
B00632HWOG|5.0|I started using this app after my computer died an I've gotta say that I am rather impressed by it. It's easy to use and very straight forward.
B00CBKLO52|4.0|This is a fun app for free. I enjoy this type of thing and it def gives my kid something to do in the car if he gets bored.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This app is pretty good on the Kindle, but sometimes it hangs and I'm not sure why. The synchronization with the Facebook interface is a little iffy sometimes, too. One other thing I'd like from this app is to not have it tell me FB friends are playing it when they aren't.
B009GED3HS|4.0|At this point the show is almost too predictable, but it does work. I feel the writers have almost given up at this point and just started watching past seasons to get ideas. The chemistry is still there, but its definitely time to move on.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|But still the best series I've ever watched.  I'd highly recommend this series to anyone, whether you like zombies or not.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|i had his last album and it was fantastic and now this album i brought is pure genius. i dont know why some people give it 2 stars, this is a lyrical genius hands down. im not a big hip hop fan but j.cole is the album i have to have when ever he puts an album out. if i could give it 10 stars hell yea i would. great job j.cole. every song is a listen to, no fast forward or skipping.
0425263924|1.0|This was compared to 50 Shades of Gray and after reading the entire triology - which book 3 left everything hanging - as if a book 4 was coming....it paled in comparison to 50 shades!  You can write a a hot, passionate love scene without being crude and vulgar.  The authors choices for describing sex scenes was simple crude and vulgar.  If my lover spoke to me or about my body like Gideon does to Eva - I would feel more like a prostitute than a treasured love!
B00BF11STU|5.0|The movie is captivating. I couldn't move out of the couch until the last second. Very well captured and a heart touching movie. Just tells me how these terrorists cause such havoc everywhere else but they themselves live in fear of being caught and killed anytime. Is it even worth it? Bible says - Those who live by the sword die by the sword and yet again this was proven in the case of Bin Laden.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Fantastic book.  Philippa Gregory never puts out a bad book. Love everything she does. Amazing attention to historical detail. Can't wait to start another
B009NY3CL8|5.0|Wonderful and Just loved Robin Williams in it!! Dustin Hoffman was great too. Not to mention my son and I were extra's.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|the sad part of this book is it is probably a reflection of the reality of life in North Korea.  Hard to believe the repression in this digital age.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Seit der ersten Ankündigung von Google,den RSS Resident aufzukündigen verwende doch Feedly. Am Anfang gelegentlich Abstürze, aber das Produkt wurde kontinuierlich besser. Was noch fehlt?<br />Offline lesen als Pocket!
B007THA4FI|3.0|This book does not read easily.  More than once I wanted to put it down because I did not feel I cared about the characters and did not care where the book was going.  Not at much fun to read as her Harry Potter books.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I am a lawyer. As a law related and legal system commentator, author, John Grisham is always realistic and unparalleled in his truth/reality.  Moreover, his writing style and character development is superb -- readable by both teenagers and adults.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|third novel not as superb as first two,but still a wonderful treatment of the effects of poverty and conflict.  My book club is reading and it will be a great discussion
B00574P9EQ|4.0|Cute! My son loves the book series and this movie encompasses all the books. Pure entertainment and it encourages my son to read the books over and over. I only gave it 4 stars b/c the movie has a lot more name calling in it, which I'm not a fan of. But overall the movie is great and I would recommend it.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It was free on my PC and I lost it when I switched to a Mac.  Having it on my Kindle is great.  Too bad it has to have ads to be free there.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|What the original should have been, please make a sequel!  Loved the comic book so please keep this going!  Lots of possibilities going forward...
0385535147|5.0|John Grisham delivers another hit, wating for the next one - will be put on the waiting list when the time arrives
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i find this game in amazon. its fun and worth to play .my husband and i like to play together .a good family game .you will like it .
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think that everybody will love it win they play it. it is really hard to get out play it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Me and my daughter played this and we loved it!!! Not too hard but not to easy... perfect fun time.
B0054S6N04|5.0|Wow, have ya'll ever heard of this great author, Linda Howard????<br /><br />Bwahaha....just kidding! Okay, so I'm knew to the greatness that is Linda Howard. I've always heard of her and never really got into anything. Call me a cover whore -  I've just never been interested in hers.<br />I finally broke down and forced myself to read Mr. Perfect. Needless to say I loved it.<br />Side Note : Apparently \\"forced\\" is a synonym for \\"forgot to blink it held my attention so well\\" and \\"loved\\" is a synonym for \\"ILOVEDITSOMUCHIDEVOUREDITINLESSTIMETHANITHOUGHTIWOULDBECUASEICOULDNOTPUTITDOWNBECAUSEITWASFRIGGINAWESOMEANDHOTANDSEXYANDIWANNADOTHISALPHAMALE\\".<br />...yeah so thanks Linda Howard. Thanks for writing a phenomenal book, and maybe it was over 10 years ago, BUT nothing in romance ever changes!I loved the side characters *tear*** I loved the whole premise of the story. Great flow, great writing......I may have to join CWA to get my cover whoreish ways under control.<br />If you want something with a great strong Alpha, a well written, well loved heroine, a HEA and a truly suspenseful, enjoyable read then STOP READING THIS REVIEW AND BUY THE BOOK ALREADY.<br />I promise, PROMISE you will love it from the beginning. Super yum!
B001H1UQRI|3.0|The good:<br />1) Fun to contemplate<br />2) Points out flaws of society<br /><br />The bad:<br />1) Misogyny, the author's favorite subject<br />2) Points out flaws of society, but only to complain, not to address them except with fantasy
B003PIUBZS|5.0|The story was great, the acting was excellent.  I am so sorry Andy died, he would have gone on to have a marvelous career.  This season was a once in a lifetime television gem!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is pretty fun the challenges make you think and are actually fun. The graphics are not to bad, better than alot of the other free amazon games.
B004P1JEXE|3.0|The story in this sequel is not as good as the first three books and the characters not as interesting. There is disjointed continuity of the various characters. It's still a good read in parts.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and addicting game. I love it. Better than I expected and much more fun than the last elevator game.
0385349947|5.0|Whether you agree with her or disagree with her or read about critics panning her in the news, it does not matter - YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK.<br /><br />She knows what she is talking about - about your career, your success and how you can achieve it. She talks about the types of people you will encounter in your work life and what their attitudes will be. She says - its ok to show emotions, its ok to feel guilt and its ok to demand 50% of work from your husband. Because simply put - if you derive happiness out of your work and I do, you OWE it to yourself to do it. She is not against the women whose sole focus is their kids - they should concentrate on mothering but for the rest, who are not - that is not the reason to be villified at the stake of bad moms. This book tells you not to be guilty, shamed or ridiculed or passed over for being a woman. It tells you that you are stronger, better and more accomplished when you achieve despite being a woman. Your children look up to you and there are few lessons that you will impart on your kids that will be as important as having a role model to look up, to aspire to.<br /><br />THIS IS WORTH READING..no matter what your views are.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|if you have not seen it yet, its hard to tell you how good it is.  the show is more about the loss of humanity and struggle than the zombies.  works great as a download.  can watch on my kindle, iphone, PC or PS3, thanks
B0067EKY9K|5.0|It's a wonderful movie, beautiful scenery and a lovely story. Makes you feel good. I recommend this movie for everyone!
B00COO2D6O|5.0|Seriously addicting. Ounce you start it is just non stop fun. graphics flow easy. I love the upgrade your troop feature it really adds to the strategy.
B0086WQNZ0|4.0|Of the 44 CDs there are actually only 34 that are music. The rest is talk or videos glorifying Gould. While he is a great artist, his personality and views are irrelevant, from my point of view - I am only interested in the music - which on the whole is great. THe quality of sound is not always great but this is understandable as these are historical recordings. One problem from my point of view is that there is no concentrated list of the tracks on each of the discs. Not even on the discs themselves! which attempt to imitate the original vinyl records. Details of the discs are embedded in a big volume with a lot of verbiage (which I did not bother reading). It would be a simple and helpful mater to include a pamphlet with just details of CD tracks. One more minor items - the title is The complete Bach Collection. I suppose what is meant is the complete available Gould recordings. It is not the complete list of keyboard works by Bach. Furthermore non-Bach works, such as Beethoven concertos are superfluous.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|works fine, links to your setup online and is able to give you the information you are looking for, thanks
0062059963|3.0|In book two of The Selection, Keira Cass continues America's adventures in the royal dystopian world in The Elite. Following up where book one ended, the girls are now narrowed down to the top six - the Elite - amid world turmoil and rebel attacks.<br />  Assuming you've read the first book, you probably already know that this is not a top tier dystopian series. The writing quality, world development, and story plot are not up to par with \\"The Hunger Games\\" or \\"Divergent,\\" and the love triangle is relatively weak. The story combines the popular dystopian atmosphere with ideas from \\"The Princess Diaries\\" series and \\"The Bachelor\\" reality show. While the ideas are not new, I do find the combination of them all appealing, and the story entertaining. I read both of the books in about three days each, so they are addicting, but I more find them amusing as fulfillment of my dystopian need while waiting for the next \\"Hunger Games\\" movie, or the third \\"Divergent\\" book.<br />  The story has both strong and weak spots. Cass does a great job of leaving you wanting more at the end of each book. You want to know the ending. You want to what these rebels want. You want to know how this world came to be this messed up. While we got glimpses of that in book one, we still don't really know how it all ties together. That said, while you do learn more of it in this book, it is still brief. I would really like to see this world tied together more completely in the third book.<br />  In addition to the incomplete knowledge of the world outside the palace, the love triangle grows incredibly tiresome in this book. I found myself on more than one occasion saying to myself, \\"Oh my gosh, how silly are you? Just pick one!\\" I felt like the book focused so much on going back and forth between Maxon and Aspen that the story didn't progress very much. Maybe I'm just a little biased against love triangles, as they have become such a required thing in novels now so that these books have a Team So-and-So... But I feel like it's worn out. There were sometimes in the book that in the span of just a page or two, America would say things like, \\"Oh, Aspen is the one. How could I forget? He's the most true to me,\\" and then turn around a page later and say, \\"No, I was wrong. Maxon is the one. How could I forget? He's the most true to me.\\" It seemed really silly, and made her character seem so weak. Which is odd, because the author tries to build America up into this strong, independent woman. But in this novel, she seems very weak and fickle.<br />  Despite all these things, the story is not bad. Yes, these negative things are present and somewhat annoying, but the book is still enjoyable. Would I reread it again? Probably not. Would I recommend it to someone else, though? Sure. With the market so flooded with these types of stories right now, I do feel like it holds it's own enough, and it is a good in-between read while waiting for the next in another series. I found it more enjoyable than other popular novels like \\"Matched\\" or \\"The Chemical Gardens.\\" I suppose because the story, while dystopian, is more lighthearted than the others. It focuses more on the Bachelor-esque side of the story than the dark dystopian side most of the time. Sometimes, that's nice to have.<br />  All in all, if you read the first one and liked it, you should read this one as well. If you didn't like the first one, but want to see what happens next, I might go ahead and skip it. The story doesn't progress enough, so you'll just stay frustrated with the series. Read the spoilers instead. This book is decent, neither good nor bad, and thus my middle-of-the-road rating with three stars. However, you'll still find me reading the next one!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am first reading this now because I was afraid the book would not deliver. I was definitely wrong!  My backside is aching but only because I read the book in one sitting!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|love this game very fun to play both temple run and temple run 2 would recommend both temple runs. great challenge
B008JFUP0I|5.0|This latest installment of the Fast & Furious saga has once again delivered. The street racing that once made the original movie an instant classic has been revived. The over the top action that we've all come to disbelievingly know and love is all there.
B00BHNR1KQ|4.0|Spooky, strange, suspenseful.  Keeps you wondering what's next.  It gets a bit gory towards the end.  Can't emphasize enough, do not watch this movie by yourself.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|Always have liked ColdPlay and the first time I heard Viva La Vada it went straight into my top 5 songs of all time and is still there. I don't have a number one Just the top 5.  Excellent lyrics and melody.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is so fun and addicting. I love it. definatly worth the download. cant wait for more levels yeah! My daughter also loves this game.  it helps with logic, memory and problem solving. even though you figure it out one time it still feels like a challange subsequent times that you play it.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This book is amazing. It's not just any romantic novel, it's tender and patient, keeping the reader quiet in anticipation. It's honest and charming, with moments that will melt your heart. It's also raw and serious, putting the reader in various situations that are so well written, you may feel shaken. This book is wonderful and definitely one of my new favorites!
B004INNRFK|5.0|David Foster's music and his selection of artists is wonderful listening music. I buy when I can. I'm a senior citizen.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Best Southern Rock to come this way since the 70's! Soulful, with a twist of downhome rock! Brittany shines with the band! Keep the songs coming!
B005K17RU0|1.0|To much junk with little improvement. The old version was fast and simple. There is still no lighting track. Just videos of I don't care.
B0062LU85S|5.0|Love the ability to purchase music from Amazon, and use it on my ipod. Sometimes the music is cheaper than on itunes.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Continued the story in a well enough fashion but wasn't as engaging as the first one. Read it to get to the end.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|This third book in the trilogy combined the best of fiction with history with a surprise ending that leave the reader wondering about  what finally happended.
1878424319|5.0|An interesting revelation of wisdom for living. I intend to reread it. Opened up a different avenue of understanding. Great book.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Easy to use, quick & effective, recommend everyone uses kindle for andiods. Prefer method when you don, t have the printed version. Idea for sight challenge individual.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|Is a beautifull and chip watch... is a nice brand with pretty model and high quality. I recomend this brand!!

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm so obsessed with Gideon and Eva. I would only read a few pages at a time just to make it last since we aren't sure when the next book will be released. Their hot, steamy relationship is so passionate I wish in had m own Gideon!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I just finished Entwined with You which is the third book in this series.  I absolutely loved all 3 of these books.  I also read Fifty Shades of Grey.  While Sylvia Day's books are written along those lines, these characters are more believable.  I always thought Christian was just this side of artificial and Anastasia was a bubble head at times.  These characters are more grounded with more depth to them.  This was also a red hot, scorch the pages, incredible, sexy as hell novel. I loved the twists and turns that these two go through.  It kept me reading and I just couldn't put it down. Once you get wrapped up in this, you'll definitely want more.
0316154687|5.0|Funny.  Have read other Sedaris books.  His stories and antics make me laugh out load.  His family makes most families appear &#34;normal&#34;
B007IXWL2C|5.0|O man, I don't want it to end. I want more! Lol<br />This trilogy is absolutely amazing.  I could not put it down. There's action, romance, conflict, everything! I usually like James Patterson books and was hesitant to read this but I am beyond glad that I did. These books are so much more than the sex (although those parts are good too lol). The revelations are breathtaking. Between Mrs Robinson, Hyde, Christian's fifty shades I could not look away.  I love the way they loved each other despite all the obstacles.  I cannot wait for E.L. James to write another trilogy.<br />And I cannot wait for this movie. I hope they choose Matt Boner.
B009SQOGZ2|4.0|my kids and i loved this movie..how ever there is a few comments in the movie to gear this to teens..not sure my 5 year old needs to here these comments. (mostly because they are sexual..)but my 11 year old really loved this movie..and so did i.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Excellent quality and unbeatable price. This movie is action packed from start to finish. An action movie with some comedy who could ask for more.
B00263HWM8|4.0|Non-stop action and intriguing storyline make this a very enjoyable movie. I am not a fan of Tom Cruise, but he does deliver the goods in this action film. Great photography!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The subject is a difficult one - terminally ill young cancer victims. Sounds like it would be depressing, and it might have been, if the principal characters in this story accepted their fates with resignation and self-pity.<br />Having worked with teenagers, and some with debilitating and terminal diseases and conditions, I saw first-hand the kind of determination depicted in this novel - to fight against the diagnosis, to win little victories, to exasperate loving and desperate parents, and, ultimately, to live - and die -with some measure of independence.<br />This is a powerful book, should be on all high school reading lists.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great app and easy to use.  I can put in the location I am going to so I can see what to expect of the weather.
B00785P2QC|4.0|it not one of the games where you have a certain amount of time to come back before things go haywire and cant be salvaged so its perfect for people who have a life they have a life they have to live lol
B005DD7H50|4.0|I only had mild interest in seeing this as I felt it would be predictable. I was surprised by it, and while somewhat predictable, it was intriguing and well made. I am now a Bradley Cooper fan-- he really delivers in this well-directed film.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|We just bought an EDGE from FOED. But we love Alex and Anthony. They are great actors. They should make more movies together.
B002SS8S7E|5.0|This is still one of the best movies I have ever seen! Great HD quality from Amazon just adds to the whole experience.
B008M87GJK|4.0|I like very much how the headlines are displayed and the categories used.  I also appreciate the fact that you can edit categories as well.  Great for getting quick headlines as to what's going on.  Keeps me nice and informed.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|It is so well written and the acting is even better! I am an Anglophile and naturally love this. On top of everything else that is so great about it, the scenery is sublime. I am ready to pack up and move! The moral backbone of the stories within are pleasing and should be shared with family.
B0033TI4BW|5.0|Dan Pink is not only an excellent writer, book was entertaining from start to finish, but is also an excellent presenter. The book has helped me as a leader to work out how to better motivate my staff
1452101426|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of &#34;Art of&#34; books and this one certainly doesn't disappoint. You can see plenty of pictures of all your favorite characters and is wonderful for artists who need good reference.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|If you have ever been in a long relationship or are married and/or have kids, this movie is a must see. Great writing, great acting, and great anecdotes about life at 40.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|First, let me say this is my first book review.  I purchased this book b/c I came across a lot of reviews that recommended it as something to read after the 50 shades of grey series.  I felt that this book was written for a young audience.  I am only 24 and felt this story was too young of a read for me.  This story takes place with the female protagonist turning 19 in the story and it is set on a college campus w/ frat parties. I know other reviewers will disagree, but for me this book lacked a real sense of romance and unlike w/ 50 shades this book does not contain ANY real sizzling scenes.  All in all the relationship btwn Travis and Abby was very dysfunctional to the point that it did not seem realistic.  I bought this book to love it and I'm sorry to say I disliked it.  I'm surprised by all of the raving reviews.  I will say if you are looking for another read similiar to 50 shades try Sylvia Day's Bared to You series I really enjoyed it.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|5, best app for receipts<br />includes trimming in workflow<br />sync to cloud for archive so big brother knows u keep ur paper receipts
1608871088|5.0|This book was one I was excited to see just because of all the different character designs. It doesn't disappoint.
B00BXHLM1K|1.0|[[ASIN:B003Y58CKI Gounod: Faust]]The Metropolitan Opera under the misguided leadership of Peter Gelb and some tasteless set directors has entered a new era known as \\"Trashing Opera at the Met.\\" It's a shame to see talented singers stoop so low as to perform great works of operatic literature in surroundings that the composers and librettists would find appalling and completely disrespectful. Last year the Met degraded Gounod's \\"Faust\\" and Goethe's poetic masterpiece by placing Faust in a nuclear power plant. This year the Met has degraded Verdi's great masterpiece \\"Rigoletto\\" by placing him in the cheap glitter of Las Vegas. It appears that the Met has decided to hire set designers who either don't have any appreciation for what the composer and literary source had in mind or, perhaps, have never read the the literature or librettos that inspired great composers like Gounod and Verdi. Yes, there is always a audience for trashy productions, but it is a sign of disrespect and ignorance to applaud such trash.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Powerful story, at times hard to watch, yet inspiring. I can understand why Naomi Watts was nominated for an Oscar.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|Can't they come up with something better than this tired old plot? It's been done 100 times or more. Stallone played the same role a few years ago. Arnold should choose something slightly more uplifting.
034544678X|5.0|I am about half way through the book & it is wonderful. The writing is easy to follow & the suggestions make a lot of sense. I have started to apply some of them and am already seeing some changes (in both my dog and myself).  No matter what kind of a dog you have or what the issues are, this book will help you tremendously.<br /><br />You will learn a lot about yourself and your dog.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was awesome! I can't wait for new levels! :-)) This game will keep you occupied for hours! Yay for this new game!
B003R0LBVW|5.0|I loved the story, especially the characters: very intriguing and complex. Looking forward to read another book from the same author.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|This actor is out of touch with anybody over 14. The film is a formula film not worth watching except if you have nothing else to do. Cruise is starting to lose his youthfulness...too bad.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Love this movie...have used sound bites from this movie for so many situations...so funny! Not so appropriate for small children but that would go with the rating...for adults however, hilarious!
B003G4W49C|2.0|The entire second half of the book you can guess quite easily the ending.<br />And from that point it becomes tiresome
068817776X|5.0|You never know in terrible times who will help you and what depths of ingenuity and versatility you may discover in yourself.  This book told it all.  It was also well written.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Great show. I want to see more. I like Travis. he's a convincing actor....when will it return? In the winter?
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Music that will stand the test of time and keep on entertaining.  All of the songs on the CD are great.  We bought it for Wagon Wheel, but love the whole CD.
B004LUS390|5.0|I wish i had found this one first, but im glad i did. It has alot of graphics to work with, and easy to find your way around. click once to select, click your selection, and click to exit and use the tool. GET THIS APP.
B005544TRQ|4.0|I don't know why I am addicted to this show! I can control myself a little and keep it to one show per day, but it takes extreme willpower. Maybe it's the sharp wit and quippy one-liners. Maybe it's because I was a corporate lawyer and find the drama amusing and much more interesting version of reality (I try not to nit pick). Anyway, I like it!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I have included several important notations up to this point.<br />i can see there are capabilities that I will use in the future.
B008HRZ4TK|5.0|Best way to keep unwanted eyes from seeing things you want hidden.  Hey sometimes privacy is what you want and this will provide it easily.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|It was a great book and I really enjoyed it. I ended up reading it 3 days because it was so good😄😄😄😄
B005XZHQKY|5.0|My parents baught a really huge TV that is 3D, I got this for them for my moms birthday and she very much loves it. Said it was beautiful. I have not had the time to see it yet but will.
1449410243|1.0|This book's humor content is only marginally higher than the quality of the artwork... which is abysmal. I can only imagine the small, dark soul which would write something like \\"really funny\\" and still be referring to this book. If only it kept to the topic of scheming, murderous cats it might have been worthy of two stars, but it wanders around topics, almost as if it might finally find something worthy of a laugh. The incredible letdown when it fails, time and again, is depressing.<br /><br />I would have rated it less than one star,,, except I like cats.
B001LF3YQK|1.0|Its terrible! Red lid comes off very easily. If you put more wipes it opens by it self! i hate it , very bulky. Do not buy it.
1451668945|4.0|I read all of the books by this author so of course I enjoyed this book. I like most mysterys.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Easy to read, a very driven storyline and excellent dialogue between characters. On book four and am dreading finishing the last one because then I will have to wait on the next.
B001OGWY1W|4.0|It was a good movie, but I prefer it in Cartoon since I grew up watching batman and I like it that way.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|The game in and of  itself  is really good. Only problem is, it costs real world money in order to progress at a satisfying rate. The potions are the main problem. You get three. That's it. If you need another, you have to wait or pay. Need more carrying space? You'll have to pay. Thanks for being &quot;free&quot; Don't spend your only gem s on a potion
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Color and scenery were good.  Nice homage to the original, but lacked originality.  The acting was a bit stilted at times.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Loved the graphics and liked the fact that there were lots of different scenes in which you had to think and strategize ahead of time. Absolutely enjoyed the story line kept you guessing .Am looking forward to the sequel.
B008602KQI|5.0|awesome, blah b blah blah blah Really? thirteen more words to go?  It was good ok? All I wanted to do was rate it with the stars!  I wont do this again!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was really a great book, one that I didn't want to put down.  The story was very intriguing and somewhat unsettling.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Intriguing, funny and worth watching.<br />Solid enjoyable Entertainment<br />Something new around each corner....<br />The Good guy always wins.<br />Check it out.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It's really fun but its HARD.  I'm on level  3 and it won't let me pick up the Key. And so far there's  only been one pop up ad.  And over all its fun,good quality,hardly any ads but hard I recommend it for 8+.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|The plot twisted and branched off, looped back around - classic! As much as I love the tv show, the books stay with you - haunting your thoughts at odd moments.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app has significantly reduced my 8-year old ADHD son's anxiety about transitioning into bed time.  He literally hops into bed at bedtime (a small miracle) and creates his own melody for that night.  He saves them all and gives them names too.  Great transitioning tool.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|This movie had decent acting and some scary moments for sure, but the ending was a bit hokey in my opinion.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is GREAT AND AMAZING. It's fun to play with and you have daily challenges and YOUGET TO BUY BOARDS AND DO UPGRADES. And another good thing is there's no bug problems or any other type of problem. There are adds but very few and it doesn't interrupt you when your playing which is good.  I would recommend this for you and for everyone.  And I will promise to you, you will have a BLAST
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Awesome Show! Just watch it!! If you like action watch this show!! I don't know what else to tell you.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|To good for network TV additive hard to stop watching Archie Panjabi is a dream come true good job folks.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|As always, Hosseini gives sharp, poignant insights into the lives and personalities of his characters.. But unlike his other books, he does not tie his characters together into one memorable story.  Great short stories but not a novel as brilliant as his previous two.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This has to be my favorite book series. I'm not a big reader but I can read these books over and over.
B000005RDY|5.0|would be even better if it had some from the cd impeckable but since i have that cd its ok. Budgie is one of the original power trios that had some killer tunes. Breadfan and Napoleon Bona parts 1&3 bing down the house.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Jurassic Park is surprisingly fun. I find myself wanting to log in just to hear the dinosaurs roar when I collect money. Them missions seem to move at a decent pace. It is a fun game.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Overall, I enjoyed the love story between Cross and Gideon. Disappointed that there was not a final resolution to their romance and now I have to wait for book four.
0810971496|2.0|I bought this book used. I expected a little writing in the book but when i got it the whole first half of the book was written on.This book was a total waste of my money
B000TEUSJK|4.0|Weird movie but has some great sex scenes. Does show though just how brutal and freaky the Romans were with regards too sex.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|It's Star Trek. I think they did a great job with this movie. The characters were very well done. It will be interesting to see what they do with this now that they've updated it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Calculator Plus free is a great app. It is just what I need on the go, anytime, all the time
B008SGMPVU|2.0|I've always been a fan of this movie and have it also on VHS (somewhere) and DVD.<br />I thought Blu Ray would be nicer than the DVD.<br /><br />Well, the video is OK but nothing better than the DVD. Not to my eyeball.<br /><br />The package, though, is garbage. Color photocopy of a pretty lame design. Also, they couldn't be bothered to line up the photocopy in the paper-cutter straight while cranking out the batch of Blu Rays in someone's kitchen late at night. It really has the look and feel of a bootleg junker. I was surprised that the imaging on the disc itself is printed on... after seeing the case I expected the disc to either be entirely plain or with an inkjet sticker on it.<br /><br />Oh well... maybe one day VCI Entertainment will grow out of that kitchen and develop nice product. Or not...
B000MD7OKY|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock's &#34;To Catch a Thief&#34; could not be more perfect as a film of legends in a golden age. Those who were chosen as actors and actresses where the &#34;Cream of the Crop&#34; Grant and Kelly made the movie glow with warmth and joy in that anticipation of their first kiss. One of the very best films of all times!!! One that I enjoy over and over again!!! It's really to bad that many actor and actresses today can not even approach the quality of these &#34;STARS&#34;, no! in all reality many today are as wannabe's in the light of these Stars.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I loved this book. At first I was skeptical about the style of the book how it was written in letter form instead of chartered but I soon found out that it didn't make a difference. This book was great and made me connect with each and every character from start to end. This book made me appreciate life a little bit more and realize that I need to participate more in life. Can't wait to see the movie
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Awesome this the best game ever I will 10 hours a day on this game 1.99? Worth it<br />So if this is 5 stars I'm not surprised
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Master storyteller. Just as good as The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns. Was worth the wait for his third book.  As expected, Hosseini delivers.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a shocking ending.  Who'd a thunk it.  Well you'll have to read it to find out.  Again, I laughed, I cried, I held my breath, got pissed off.  Gonna reread for sure!
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Bought the Album because Amazon had the Digital Copy listed at 11.99, whereas the CD was only 9.99, and included the digital copy and a $1 credit. So yeah, that was a no brainer.<br />Love the tracks Radioactive and It's Time.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I came across this game while recovering from surgery. It has some great mental challenges. I enjoy solving each quest and moving to the next.
B00821OX98|5.0|I am really enjoying this series.<br />Another reason to have Amazon Prime that includes so many other advantages<br />I will definitely be keeping it for another year.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book started it all.  I watched the movie first and was drawn in.  My fave book since the Harry Potter books.  I also love female heroines!  Katniss rates right up there with Mulan!
B000001ELP|5.0|Music From The Elder is unquestionably the most controversial and misunderstood of all KISS records. A &#34;concept album&#34; about a young boy who is chosen by a counsel of &#34;Elders&#34; to fight evil, it at first would appear to be a soundtrack record for a movie that was never made (hence the &#34;From&#34; in the album title).<br /> While NOT a typical hard rocking KISS disc, Music From the Elder does mix carefully constructed, guitar driven rock songs (such as &#34;I&#34;, &#34;Dark Light&#34;, and the brilliant &#34;The Oath&#34;- one of the heaviest and best KISS songs EVER recorded), with orchestra laden epics such as &#34;Odyssey&#34; and the magnificently dark &#34;Under the Rose&#34;. Adding in the moody and atmospheric &#34;A World Without Heroes&#34; (which features an excellent guitar solo courtesy of none other than Paul Stanley) and the frenetically paced instrumental &#34;Escape From The Island&#34; and you have a record that should have impressed critics with it's diversity, listenability and scope, rather than invite their rath simply because the songs were performed by a band named KISS.<br /> Going back as far as 1979-1980, many hardcore KISS Army members had begun to lose faith in the band following the overproduced and pop oriented &#34;Dynasty&#34; and &#34;Unmasked&#34; records. Those fans were hoping KISS' next record would be a return to their early/mid 1970's hard rocking roots. What they got instead was the most &#34;un-KISS like&#34; of ALL KISS records- Music From The Elder- and sales-wise, the results WERE disasterous. The Elder was a commercial failure and could have nailed the coffin lid shut on a LESSER band's career. It didn't, however, and in 2013, &#34;Music from the Elder&#34; has achieved a kind of legendary &#34;cult&#34; status in KISS fan circles. Many fans who rejected the Elder upon it's initial release have grown to appreciate not only the albums excellent songwriting, peformances and production, but also the guts it took for Stanley, Simmons, Frehley, and Carr to steer the record in an exciting new direction that no KISS album had ever gone before (or has since).<br /> I have been a hardcore KISS fan since May of 1976. I was 14 years old when &#34;Music From The Elder&#34; was released, and while it is likely that I was in the minority back then, I loved the record from the moment I first heard it. From concept and storyline, to gatefold sleeve (that's a vinyl record jacket for all of you youngsters out there!), and the excitingly different (for KISS) music contained within, I look upon KISS' &#34;Music From The Elder&#34; as a complete work of art, and a brilliantly bold move by a band whose musicianship and songwriting abilities are often sorely (and unjustly) underrated.<br /> Buy this disc, put it in your CD player, close your eyes and enjoy!!al failure and could have nailed the coffin lid shut on a LESSER band's career.

B000F8O2PG|5.0|Loved this whole series and miss the characters - like old friends. Getting to watch the episodes without commercial breaks is a treat.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great way to pass the time...several game options. works well with  no problems on my kindle. I recommend this app.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Book number two, an excellent continuation to Hunger Games.  It was amazing.  I laughed, I cried, I held my breath, it frustrated me.  Awesome book.  Plan to reread soon.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|One of the best apps overall that I have used. Great features, easy to use, accesses the music on my phone for alarms. And best of all, I actually stay awake with the math to turn off setting. Highly recommend.
B003U6BE8I|2.0|I am not the kind of person who normally complains about books being changed when they become movies... but it really seems in this case that the movie writer didnt read the book at all. Of the 5 battles in the book, 1 was in the movie  ... and vice versa ... all 3 of the battles in the movie werent from the book. The villains werent even the same. And they left out pivitol characters that are needed for the sequels. Dropped major storylines that make it very hard to understand the story. Very disappointing.
B000IDGBWU|4.0|I will always remember the love story, the music from the early 1960s, the beautiful scenery, and the wonderful dancing !  Young love is both wonderful, and painful, and both were experienced during this movie.  I was reminded of the movie during a vacation to North Carolina, where the lake scenes were filmed.  Thanks for the opportunity to re-live both the movie and the times.  I will cherish this DVD from Amazon, and will watch it often.  I fell in love with Patrick Swayze all over again !
B001PB3RU8|5.0|Love this artist and this album does not disappoint. I can listen to it anywhere thanks to amazon mp3 that automatically comes.
0446572985|5.0|Loved, loved this new book. I started it and could not put it down. But then again, that is a DB type of book.
B008LD09LS|5.0|I keep on trying to do it but I cant do you need a real one or swath you now . but it looks cool do you need a camera for your kindle fire or yon no.ftfff
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|Very good movie. very good characters and stays true to the ideas of the book and the original movie (other than flying baboons).<br />The only flaw is the slight taste of disney all over it, not a bad thing but gives it a slight feel of campiness.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Great music, great artist, no problems with CD at all. Came very quickly, love that I can have music on my iPad from here as well.
B0095P31L6|5.0|It's a great movie with an awesome message about following your path and story. Great music and animation with enough comedy to keep you entertained!
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Arnold is getting a bit old for action hero stuff but pulls it off OK in this movie. Of course other aging stars seem to be getting a new life as action heroes so why not Arnold. It makes for a very decent rental film and was better than I expected.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It's just so much fun to play!!! Once you start u just can't stop. It gets addicting! I love how they use the same fish from the movie!! U definitely want to get pearls!! The more you have the better!!
B008B11R1Q|5.0|Love this band, one of my absolute favorites Nd this album does not disappoint. Thank you for the promptness in service.
B007L5KT76|5.0|Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law are brilliant as Sherlock and  Watson...the chemistry between them is magical.  I LOVE them together!!!
B00CX1TSSO|5.0|Our family enjoyed this movie,over and over! Other than the somewhat scary face of the Giants,its a decent one with nice special efffects and some humor on it.ThUmbs up!
0679805273|5.0|We bought this for my daughter's preschool as their graduation giveaways. Perfect send off to kindergarten gift! Can't go wrong with Dr. Seuss.

193700788X|5.0|Dead Ever After (2013) is the thirteen Fantasy novel in the Southern Vampire series, following [[ASIN:0425256383 Deadlocked]].  The initial volume in this sequence is [[ASIN:0441008534 Dead Until Dark]].<br /><br />In the previous volume, Sookie and her friends visited Hooligans for Ladies Only night.  Bellonos showed them to a table right by the stage, a privilege of being cousin to the owner.  Tara sat on Sookie's right and Holly sat on her left.  Kennedy and Michele sat on the other side of the table.<br /><br />Gift was their server.  She took their orders and then returned with the drinks.  Claude came prancing onto the stage wearing spangled silver tights and boots.  A line of male dancers filed onto the stage behind him.<br /><br />Claude introduced the dancers, but one of them was known to all her friends.  The last dancer was JB, Tara's husband.  Nobody looked at Tara, but she obviously hadn't known that he would be there.<br /><br />Tara left the table before JB danced.  He definitely enjoyed being in the spotlight.  He was a little concerned when he noticed the Bon Temps ladies, but continued his act.  After Tara came back, the ladies talked about how well he performed his act.<br /><br />In this novel, Sookie Stackhouse is a waitress at Merlotte's Bar and Grill in Bon Temps, Louisiana.  She also has a little disability:  she hears what other people are thinking.  Since vampires and Weres are much less likely to have perceivable thoughts, she tends to relax in their company.<br /><br />Jason Stackhouse is Sookie's older brother.  He was bitten by a werepanther and then married within the Hothouse community.  Now his wife is dead, but he has recovered enough to go out with Michele.<br /><br />Eric Northman is a vampire and a Sheriff in the Louisiana kingdom.  He owns Fangtasia, a vampire bar in Shreveport.  He is now married to Sookie by vampire customs.<br /><br />Sam Merlotte is a pure shapeshifter, able to change into almost any animal, but prefers to transform into a collie.  He owns the bar where Sookie works, but now Sookie also owns a part of the business. Sam still has not revealed his love for Sookie.<br /><br />Bernadette Merlotte is Sam's mother.  Bernie lives in Wright, Texas.<br /><br />Amelia Broadway is a human witch.  She had accidentally turned her lover Bob into a cat.  She and Bob had lived with Sookie for a while, but are now living together in New Orleans.<br /><br />Copley Carmichael is Amelia's father.

He is a grandson of Niall and is Sookie's cousin.  He still misses his sister Claudine.  He and Dermot were recently taken into Faery by Niall.<br /><br />Dermot is a fairy half-breed, with some human in his ancestry.  He is a granduncle of Sookie and looks much like Jason.  He used to work at Hooligans before returning to Faery.<br /><br />Desmond Cataliades is mostly demon,but has a touch of human blood.  He is a lawyer and has a niece -- Diantha -- who is a friend of Sookie.<br /><br />Arlene Fowler was a barmaid at Merlotte's Bar and Grill, but she got religion.  After she helped the cult to abduct Sookie and attempt to crucify her, she was convicted as an accomplice and sent to prison.  She has two children, Coby and Lisa.<br /><br />In this story, Copley sells his soul to a devil.  Tyrese does too, so the devil gives Copley a signing bonus for the referral.  Copley asks for a raincheck.<br /><br />Six months later, Copley wants the devil to find the cluviel dor.  The devil does find it, but Sookie had just expended its powers to bring Sam back to life.  Copley has to find another way to remove Sookie's influence from his daughter.<br /><br />Mister Cataliades overhears that conversation.  Later he reports it to Sookie and Amelia.  Copley's reputation suffers from that information.<br /><br />Sookie is very busy.  She has just raised Sam from death and now has to cope with his reaction.  She is the only bridesmaid at Jason and Michele's wedding and needs to find a dress.<br /><br />Sookie calls in sick.  Since Sam has also claimed to have the flu, the barmaids are making risque comments.  Fortunately, Tara comes over and wants to go shopping.  Sookie soon is feeling better and even finds the perfect dress for Michele's wedding.<br /><br />Sookie goes back to work, but Sam is still off.  Sookie contacts his mother in Texas and suggests that she come to visit.  Sookie likes Bernie and knows that she would be good for Sam's morale.<br /><br />Since she is part owner of the bar, Sookie has a few extra duties.  She now manages the hiring.  Arlene is out of prison on bail and comes by to ask for a job.  Naturally, Sookie doesn't hire her.<br /><br />So Arlene goes back to her lawyer and the other man and reports the situation.  They ask Arlene to steal a scarf from Sookie and give her a charmed coin to carry.  When Arlene returns with the scarf, the men kill her.<br /><br />The next day, Sam finds her body in the dumpster behind the bar.  Sookie shows up for work and finds him staring into the waste bin.  Sookie also looks in and sees the body.  They discuss moving the body elsewhere, but finally agree to call the police.<br /><br />Later, the police arrest Sookie for the murder.  She is totally humiliated by the jail time, but her friends show up at the preliminary hearing.  The judge lets her make bail and go home.<br /><br />Eric has Mustapha put up the bail money.  Sam starts avoiding Sookie.  He seems mad, but Sookie thinks that he isn't mad at her.  Of course, she can't read the mind of a shifter, but his anger appears to be aimed elsewhere.<br /><br />Almost everybody in town who has any contact with Sookie believes her innocent of the crime.  Jason calls her lawyer and spreads the word.  Amelia and Bob come to Bon Temps to help.  Cataliades and Diantha also come with information and to assist in her defense.<br /><br />Sookie goes back to work after getting out of jail.  Holly, Kennedy and the others at Merlotte's assure her that they don't believe the charges.  Even Michele offers to help.<br /><br />With all the guests in her house, Sookie is reminded of the times Claude and Dermot had lived with her.  Sookie realizes that she has been lonely since Niall took them back to Faery.  Now she isn't lonely.  Even Quinn shows up, but luckily he takes a motel room<br /><br />This tale brings many of Sookie's friends -- and enemies -- back to Bon Temps.  Friends assist in proving her innocence and the enemies try to harm her.  She is getting really tired of people trying to kill her.<br /><br />Sookie wonders how her grandmother would have reacted to the arrest.  This is the last installment of the series, but [[ASIN:0425269515 After Dead]] will tell you everything you wanted to know about Sookie Stackhouse.<br /><br />Highly recommended for Harris fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of preternatural creatures, telepathic barmaids, and a little romance.  Read and enjoy!<br /><br />-Arthur W. Jordin
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Came this afternoon and will be watchign it shortly. Have to get all the other stuff done so not interupted.  I couldn't find this second season anywhere where I live to really looking forward to viewing!!!  Yay!!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I loved Enigmatis!! Mystery and suspense at every turn!! Though not as terrifying as: Shiver: The Vanishing Hitchhiker, this was the first big fish game I ever got love it highly reccomend it
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I love this game a lot, very very fun! Can't wait for there to be more like this to play!
B00BD2DRHW|3.0|Don't really play it much, doesn't really seem to go anywhere to me. I don't play it at all anymore.
B000FBJAF0|3.0|Not the best from Frederick Forsyth.  He introduces a multitude of interwoven characters and plot lines, and at times the novel loses focus and narrative direction. Forsyth's journalistic instincts get in the way. He has a tendency to introduce every new character or plot development with a historical summary and analysis, which although interesting can detract from the storyline. Good read, but formulaic and not one that will necessarily keep you turning the pages, drinking coffee to stay up and finish the book.
B00AKO93JK|4.0|I really enjoy using this app. I just wish that it would tell you how many calories you have burned. It should have settings where you are able to put in your weight and height. Thank you!
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Way too redundant in tournament mode. Need new challenges and don;t find them with this game. But I keep playing anyway!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am a big lover of puzzles and this game contains some pretty fun ones. They're not too hard but not too easy either. I recommend this game to everyone.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A heartbreaking story - a good one for a book club.  Unfocused young woman is hired to care for a quadrapeligic
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game and its kind of a stress reliever. you can slash fruit for free. everyone should get this app. I sure love it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|OMG THIS GAME ROCKS!!!!!!!!! This helps my legend of Zelda gaming. Y don't u get this game it is awesome. Rock on.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought that Mockingjay was the best book in the trilogy...although an argument can be made that the best book in the trilogy was The Hunger Games........<br /><br />I ABSOLUTELY LOVED Mockingjay.......
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|This is the best Blake Shelton album to date.  I enjoyed every song on the album.  The album starts with the rousing Boys 'Round here which is followed by the hit, Sure be cool if you did.  This album is chock full of great songs.  I played the album several times since purchasing it.  Buy this album.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|what a challenge..fun. had me stumped for quite awhile. not ashamed to say that I passed it around for some help.
B008BU70HW|1.0|This is completely unreadable on either my Kindle or Kindle for iPhone.  It shows two book pages per screen in tinier text than you can imagine, and even enlarging it doesn't make it legible.  I want my money back!  Don't waste yours.
B00A3OT34M|4.0|I am not a big fan of RAP music but the mix in this one with Christina's powerful voice and catchy tune really got me. I listen to it often and am in the older generation(69).
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Guys at work love it to. I would definitely recommend this puzzle toy.  On a scale of one to 10 I give it w8 and the as two for the replayablilty of it.
B0000AK7A8|3.0|the movie its self was fine  there were some smudges on the disk as well as some scratches , made the movie skip a bit  however over all the seller delivered the product as ordered, i wish the quality had been a bit better , but i am overall satisfyed .
0316056898|5.0|I'm not a TV fan but even I have heard of Tina Fey.  I started reading this book with no expectations and am very pleasantly surprised.  It's very entertaining and real.  I can relate to some of her stories, like the breast feeding (the Teat Nazis) father who held up a bottle of breast milk and said \\"This stuff is liquid gold.  You know it actually makes them smarter?\\"  Tina screamed \\"Let's set a date!  IQ test.  Five years from today.  My formula baby will crush your baby!\\"<br />There are also so many great tips and techniques for life and some about great management skills disguised as lessons learned from Lorne Michaels.  Tina has the wisdom to glean valuable lessons which she put to use later when she became the boss.  Laugh out loud funny.  Thank you.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|My smartphone never had it so good.  Pull this baby out of the backpack and its got power to burn.  Power on dude, cha!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. Can't wait for the update. Game is exciting and fun. Highly recommended<br />It's free, you can't beat free
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|It is a very good game but there should be an update where you could make your own car for about $1000000
B00BSBVLF8|1.0|I never thought I'd be disappointed by a Cirque Du Soleil DVD, but this time, I was.<br /><br />I own all the other DVDs available directly from Cirque, and was looking forward to Cirque's collaboration with James Cameron. Just imagine, Cirque Du Soleil plus Avatar!!<br /><br />Sad to say, there is almost no original material here. This is just a \\"best of Cirque Du Soleil\\" collection tied together with a sad, minimal story of a \\"disappeared\\" aerialist and the girl who looks for him.<br /><br />The worst part is that Cirque now has so many shows going in Vegas that they are no longer compatible with each other. I just can't see the Beatles mixed with \\"O\\", and the wonderful Cirque \\"tilting wall\\" shown as disconnected clips.<br /><br />There was nothing gluing this haphazard mess together and I'm sorry I paid for it (though fortunately, I saved some wasted money by purchasing the streaming video, not the DVD).<br /><br />First time I can ever remember being disappointed by Cirque Du Soleil. If I knew it was a feeble compilation, I never would have bought it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Very entertaining... I'm more excited to watch the movie adaptations now. I was expecting more of a \\"teen\\" book... but I thought katniss's character was relatable.
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|The movie stays true to the source material. Although the narration of events by Bruce Wayne has been done away with, they more than make up for it with the dialogue between the characters. All I can say is &#34;Well done&#34; to the folks over a t the DC Animated Universe.
B006S8Q8W2|5.0|This movie really made my husband and I stop and think about our lives.  We were like Richard Gere, having a great life but wanted more and feeling guilty about it.  We are no longer feeling guilty and have had our first ballroom dancing class!!!!!
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|Excellent cd. One of my favorites from slash. Myles Kennedy can really sing and hit some amazing notes. Highly recommended
B0001MDQ6W|4.0|This was agreat dvd. Dylan plays and interacts with his band like no one else in the world. When he is gone there will never be another like him.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|The best Christmas movie ever made! Our family likes to laugh and Will Farrell does it right in this movie. This movie and Home Alone are two movies that play in our house every Holiday season.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Really enjoyed this book and have started watching the television series too.  Great characters, especially the female detective with her choice vocabulary.
B006OE7XM4|3.0|While some of the ballads are good, the instruments are wonderful. Would like to see how this artist continues to develop.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Too long, confusing and slow. From the preview I thought there would be more action and intrigue. The time line skipped all over without any logical linear track.
B008602KQI|2.0|Watching young people killing each other is not something I agree with. the whole movie is ridiculous and not entertaining.
B00821OX98|5.0|The story line sucks you in from the beginning. The world has been overrun by aliens whose purpose is unknown; but small pockets of resistance fight on against all hope. It's well written, well executed and possible to imagine. The characters are well developed so that I care what their story is and what happens to them -- the acting is excellent. What else would you expect from something Spielberg puts his name to?<br /><br />We've finished Season 1 on Prime and are just starting Season 2 while we record Season 3 which has already started. I eagerly await each new episode to see what will happen next!
B00821PCJS|5.0|Action thriller a little romance and a good story and more action. It is one of the best shows I have ever seen
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is good for passing the time. It takes strategy just like regular solitaire. Love it!!!!!!!!!! Love it!!!!! Love it!!!!
0307730700|5.0|GREAT STORY OF A TRUE AMERICAN HERO. EVERYONE DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE AND HE MADE THE BEST OF IT.GOD BLESS AMERICA!
B002L6I9Z4|1.0|Calling this camera garbage is actually a disservice to real garbage, but I presume profanity is not allowed in reviews.  This camera is the worst product ever.  Bought it as a birthday gift for my 6-year-old son.  Since it has an internal battery that charges through the USB connection I opened the package to charge the battery before gift wrapping it.  The plastic clamshell package had to be destroyed with scissors to get it open (I would later regret this).  Camera charged up and seemed to function fine, so I wrapped it up and gave it to my son the next day.  He was excited, and proceeded to take 6 or 7 pictures.  Then he shut it off.  It has never restarted.  Now it only gives 3 short beeps when pressing the power button or plugging it in.  No useful troubleshooting information available from digiblue (the manufacturer). We never even got the pictures off of it to judge the quality.  Total useful lifespan of this product was about 10 minutes. A box of rocks is a better value for your $40.  It remains to be seen if I can return without the original packaging, if so, kudos to Amazon, but still DON&#34;T BUY THIS CAMERA.
B005OYKI1I|2.0|I only watched this so I wouldn't be clueless when my date and I go see Fast 6. I thought it was pretty ridiculous. Must be a guy thing.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is so cool it has great information and great quotes and best of all its free it has great fashion styles a
B000I9WW0E|5.0|For good reason. A must see movie that is fun, adventurous and just plain funny! You will not be disappointed.
B008602KQI|4.0|Acting was good. Story line was good. I didn't read the books but don't feel like I missed anything, I would watch a sequel.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|This is a prequel to the Wizard of Oz many love and remember. It adds understanding of the how and why of many main characters. Being Disney the colors are beautiful and the animated backgrounds stunning. Cast is \\"too good looking\\" but I managed just fine!
B000I9YWDO|5.0|I never tire of watching this movie, especially when my cubicle nation starts to get weird. Puts things back into perspective.
0446554995|4.0|Agent Pendergast sets out on a trail for revenge.  Characterization is extremely complex with Pendergast and development of the story's concept all over the place.  Plot can be confusing at times and some later parts bizarre at times.  Previous springboard novel had a lion with a red mane which was never fully explained.
B009G41CG2|5.0|I like all Mahjong games. This is no exception. Fun and kills time. This uses regular tiles so it would be easy for first time users.
B003M6FGTE|4.0|The beginning of this show helped to set a standard that is now trying to be copied with other 'musical' shows.  It is the beginning of the resurgence of music/choirs in schools and the appreciation of music in schools.
B00CL50KDY|5.0|Such a great movie. Unique plot, good acting, heartwarming and many parts leave you at the end of your seat. Watch it as soon as you can!!!
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Ray Stevenson - I did not know who he was but.  Initially he was a disgusting killer and downright nasty guy.  Before the season was completed, I found myself starting to like another killer . . . too bizarre.  But then I loved Dexter from Day One.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I don't know why I missed this the first time around.  Watching without the commercial interruptions is fun.  Some parts are a little far out but the acting is excellent.
B0000700KQ|4.0|I liked it, but it was a little twisted ! You will not know what really is happening until the end.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Love love loved it! Dan Brown does it again!! Couldn't put it down! Filled with mystery and suspense with amazing twist after twist. Can't wait for a movie
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved the first 2 books he wrote and love this one....it's like you are there thru generations...I'm a fan
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Loved it....great story.  I love how it references Ireland and I had just gotten back from a trip from Ireland.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|While I am as big a fan of addiction recovery as the next guy, this film kind of pulls you in with a false premise. The trailer and adds seem to say it's about airlines and flying and the industry. It is actually about the human condition in terms of struggles with addiction. It also makes a big leap in the story line. You are wrapped up in the flight drama and suddenly the story is no longer about that.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|And I buy one a week at least. The production is stellar, has an old school vibe but still sounds fresh which is a trick in itself. Has me loving the synthesizer again, the Moog in particular. I'm a musician so I may hear or listen for things differently but this has some of the nicest guitar sounds I've heard on record. I agree with another reviewer , if you liked Get Lucky then you'll love the rest of it. Other stand out tracks: Lose Yourself To Dance, Fiorgio. Oh, and unlike much of the electronica that I've heard, this record, while it would qualify as an EDM record, has real people playing real instruments and thus a human feel largely missing in the genre. If you are a composer who does EDM definitely a study piece. If your a fan you'll just love it. (In my best Robocop voice ) BUY IT.
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|Great series but probably not for young viewers....some pretty steamy sex scenes. To truly understand what is going on, you need to watch season 1 first, otherwise its hard to grasp all the nuances of the plot.  Can't wait for season 3!
B004TTHLBE|5.0|Must read everything by Neil Gaiman now. Can't stop....Must have more. As if The Sandman wasn't perfect enough, now this????
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Ok.  I became addicted to this show.  I never watched it on TV but decided to look at the beginning on my Kindle.  I could not stop watching!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app gives me all the details about the battery, and does so in a manner I understand. How much is left? How long will it last if I am surfing, playing games, reading, so forth. And it tells me how long it will take to charge up to 100%. It is one of the first apps I load when I get a new kindle. It's the best!
B0043WDK2G|5.0|This season is intriguing in several ways...both in the relationship between Castle and Beckett and in the progress on solving the case regarding Beckett's mother.
B000R3E2WW|1.0|It was not the movie I thought it would be. I am in to war movies, but this was not what I wanted.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Really enjoyable movie.  Funny and sad all at the same time. Excellent acting by all the cast members.  Watch it
B008AK8FHM|4.0|What I especially like about this book is the authors honesty about how he was before the experience and how he was after. It is always good to read the perspective of someone who did not believe in an afterlife.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I always enjoy seeing the cases Castle and Beckett are involved in and how their minds work together to evaluate the clues and solve the mystery.
141970642X|5.0|nother home run with my Great-Grandson. I have provided all of the &#34;Wimpy Kids&#34; for him. Great read for kids and the same appies to the two folowing books
B004KPQK2S|5.0|I avoided this movie for along time but it turned out to be really enjoyable.  A nice telling of a story about a truly amazing athlete
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very easy to use and really helpful for displaying battery life etc. Especially useful if I'm going to be travelling and want to know what battery life I have left
B003VBNN7C|5.0|I just love it and It's always worth it to watch it and listen I will have it in my library
B006LSZECO|1.0|This was a depressing book and everyone was mean. The plot was interesting I just could not get into it because I couldn't connect with the characters.
B00594XOZU|5.0|love it its a good messeanger lets me talk to the hoes lmao anyone and everyone should get it right now
B009NY43NY|5.0|Ended just as it should have. Better than the last few in the series with a very satisfying ending! Good read
B008FRFN7A|1.0|My Kindle Fire could not locate my printer with the app. So I can not give a higher rating.  If anyone knows of a fix I will try again.
B008ODZUN2|1.0|I rarely turn off a movie.  i could not watch this movie as it moved too slowly and bored me out of my mind.  Yet, I often enjoy Rachel Weisz acting and films ordinarily, this film was not one to have in my permanent library.  I am willing to offer it may be me.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Not really into &#34;romantic type&#34; novel. This is one hot and steamy book, along with the rest. Great book, highly recommend the series.
B008G3N71W|1.0|I would not have read this book if I had had any idea how disgusting it was. You keep thinking it is a horrible dream and something good will happen but it doesn't.
B003F9G8B8|5.0|Nelson Mandela is an amazing person who used his energy in constructive ways.  That trait clearly shows in this movie.  Well acted, well presented.  Buy it, watch it, share it.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I was anxious to hear what the boys would put together in the new effort with Ozzie.<br /><br />Great stuff - Ozzie in fine form!!!!!!!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Needed good looking watch with comfortable band to fit my large wrist.  This watch is it!  Solid Seiko quality watch that I use for both casual and dress.  Set knob solid. I have trouble finding watches with bands that will survive my use.  This band is good looking, long, and built to last!  Excellent quality at just above Timex price. No negatives at all.
B007428UN6|3.0|Interestung treatment of how to get rid of a dictator. Subterfuge, hidden to the last. Disasrerous cinsequences. The fight scenes were well done.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Biography of adult life of Temple Grandin, a woman with autism who finds a niche and fills it well.  She has firm ideas about how cattle &#34;think&#34; and she pushes for her designs.  She is more than this movie can present, check out some of her books also.
0425241505|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book, to the point that I read it in one sitting. I bought 4 of Ms Harrison's books to take on vacation with me. I enjoyed this one so much that I caved and read the second one, now I'm trying very hard to save the other two..lol!
B005LAII80|5.0|The Dredd game according to my son is amazing!  He recommends it to everyone. So go want a new game go for Dreed.
B00005RHGL|5.0|Enjoy the movie, I liked this collection cause you get a map layout of the shoot out at the ok corral
B0067EKY7M|4.0|From the ads, it was not clear what kind of movie this might be.  Turns out to be a balanced look at Muslim entrepreneur who wants to simultaneously bring tourists to his country by offering fly fishing in the dessert and the resistance of locals, attitudes of &#34;developed&#34; nations toward others, actions of individuals on all sides of the issue.  Easy to guess where the plot is going, but very nice presentation of interactions of differing persons, countries, attitudes.
B0057R5XRG|3.0|This review isn't about the movie itself but the quality of the Blu-Ray. Watching part 1 was PURE grain! DVD would of looked better. Part 2 and 3 are picture perfect. It figures that the best part ( part 1 ) was ruined.
B004LWZVZC|1.0|As a movie:<br />Even judged as a propaganda film, this is a bad movie. For \\"preaching to the choir\\", I would give it 3-stars (\\"It's OK\\"), but for the general audience, it is 1-star.<br /><br />Because of the script, most of the characters are little more than cardboard cut-outs. Only Robin Wright (as Mary Surratt) has presence as a character. The other main character is her lawyer Frederick Aiken (played by James McAvoy), but his role is primarily to be outraged, thereby serving as a vehicle for preaching at the audience. I quickly developed an unintended dislike for his character, which increased throughout the movie.<br /><br />The scenes are set-pieces and the flow is poor, resulting in a movie that feels slow-paced and meandering. There is no sense of grappling with the issues or alternatives -- there are only pronouncements and posturing. The movie doesn't rise to even the level of a mediocre episode of Law and Order. Also, many of the scenes do not feel authentic (beyond the costumes and sets). First, many of Aiken's diatribes feel incredibly modern, including things that you weren't likely to hear in 1965, much less in 1865 (I am both old enough and young enough to remember the 1960s). Second, the portrayal of the trial feels derivative of too many movies about military (show) trials, reinforcing my assessment below that the script wasn't driven by the history. Examples: [[ASIN:B00A5IXVUS Breaker Morant]], [[ASIN:B003WKL6YY Paths of Glory]].<br /><br />----<br />As history:<br />This movie prominently advertises itself as presenting a true story, and this needs to be rebutted. If one watches the documentary in the Extras or reads the history, the kindest thing that can be said is that the movie \\"was inspired by actual events\\", or more accurately that it cherry-picked and distorted events. The viewer will likely have the false impression that this was a short, hurried trial (there was a long line of both prosecution and defense witnesses). That there was little evidence of her guilt. That Mary Surratt was badly mistreated, for example being denied visits by her daughter. ...<br /><br />The movie presents images that are virtually guaranteed to be misinterpreted. For example, the prisoners are shown with bags over their heads, invoking parallels to torture. However, those were _padded_ bags and were introduced in response to a suicide attempt, but apparently were also intended to keep the prisoners from communicating with each other. The bags did turn out to be painful, but I haven't seen anything that suggests that was intentional (above the level of the jailers putting on bags more tightly than needed).<br /><br />The documentary (in the Extras) briefly raises the point that much of the controversy about Mary Surratt's guilt was rooted not in the factual evidence, but in sexism -- that a woman wouldn't/couldn't do such a thing. Yet you won't see this in the movie even though it was a significant part of the trial (character witnesses, pleas for clemency, ...).<br /><br />In describing the response to the assassination, one of the movie's historians describes that assassination as unthinkable. Yet there had been multiple assassination attempts against Lincoln, starting before his inauguration.<br /><br />One of those historians repeatedly attributes Mary Surratt's execution to animosity against Catholics, yet never explains (beyond the existence of religious prejudices) and never mentions that there was a large population of Catholics in Maryland -- because it was founded as a colony as a refuge for Catholics (Aside: In case you are wondering, some of my ancestors came to the US as Protestants fleeing Catholics, some as Catholics fleeing Protestants, and some as Protestants fleeing other types of Protestants).<br /><br />One of the historians in the Extras took umbrage at the measures taken to keep the conspirators from escaping on the reasoning that they hadn't yet been convicted. This seems suggestive of the politicsunderlying the movie.<br /><br />Some of the historians in the documentary seem to be pushing political agendas. One talks about Sec of War Stanton pushing to get \\"a correct result\\" as if that was unconnected to justice. Yet the history of the investigation and the trial was one of focusing in on only the most central of the plotters -- many who were unquestionably Confederate sympathizers but were only minor facilitators of the plot were not prosecuted, and not all those convicted were executed.

One talks about Sec of War Stanton pushing to get \\"a correct result\\" as if that was unconnected to justice. Yet the history of the investigation and the trial was one of focusing in on only the most central of the plotters -- many who were unquestionably Confederate sympathizers but were only minor facilitators of the plot were not prosecuted, and not all those convicted were executed.

B00821PCJS|5.0|Well worth watching-- new concept angles on series with similar scenarios are interesting.<br />Character development & interaction very astute. Looking forward to next season.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|I like that it can turn and stand up while watching you tube or something. It is bulky compared to how small the device is but that does protect the device better i guess. Seems pretty durable, may last a while.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Spider Sol is a favorite of mine and I play it a lot on my computer so I thought I'd get it for the kindle.<br />So far I have the free version and it is lacking as far as playability.<br /><br />It hangs too often and not only do I have to shut it down, but the kindle has to be turned off for quite awhile before it will play again.<br />That annoys me very much.<br /><br />I'd like to get the full version but if this is an indication of how it will be...no thanks.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|My husband and I both really enjoyed this movie. I think the story was well portrayed and the sets and costumes were beautiful. There were a couple of cheesy lines, but overall the performances were well done.
B00821OX98|4.0|Good series. A bit slow with the character development but interspersed with a lot of action. Highly recommended for all.
B005NFVZTM|4.0|A mostly perfect film that serves as an entertaining precedent to 2000's X-Men.<br /><br />From beginning to end, the film can't decide whether it wants to be a serious scifi drama or goofy teen comedy, although it excels in the former genre (which is how the film begins and ends), it feels weak and inappropriate when the young mutants begin partying and flirting with clumsy dialogue (in the middle of the film).
B007STXHTM|5.0|Used it a few times on vacation went down to at least 80 feet  and no problem.  I do think next time will put some silicagel packets inside just for the humidity that was trapped inside from regular air.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Synopsis:<br /><br />The enduring children's tale of Dorothy and her little dog who were swept away from their home in Kansas and placed within a magical realm. After the house lands on the Wicked Witch of the East, Dorothy is informed that her only way of getting home resides in the hands of the Great Wizard of Oz who is ruling over the people of the Emerald City. She and Toto set off on their journey to the city of green and meet three companions along the way who help her in times of trouble. Throughout her walk to the Emerald City and her secondary journey home, Dorothy is faced with the many challenges, twists and turns.<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />Okay, I admit it. I loved this story as a child and as an adult, the story is still one of my all-time favorites to read. Every now and again, I pick up the book and remind myself of the way things used to be in times now long past. The writing style is easy, descriptive and engaging enough to keep a child's attention and yet delight an adult at the same time. While the film a beloved classic, the original story has a lot more action and adventure within its covers that entices the child (and adult) to use their imagination. The dialogue is written in such a way that the child can understand without much explanation. This book is a must-read on many nighttime story lists.<br /><br />Rereading this classic brought back many memories from my childhood. My grandmother used to have me curl up in her lap with my head on her shoulder as she would read to me. It's more than likely the very reason why I am so attached to words, stories, and books! This is just the first in a series of books about Oz so there are many more adventures to be enjoyed. If you are looking for a great addition to your child's bedtime reading list, consider this for ages 6 and up.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Futuristic story about how society copes with human aggression by reverting to youth sacrifice. The heroine Catniss initially offers herself as a substitute to take the place of another younger girl, then she perseveres to survive and eventually wins the competition.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|This album is... what I would classify as TRASH! Pretty much every Kanye album as of late has been watered down lyrically as well as melodically. The lyrics seem as though an adolescent has written them....Complete garbage. Shame on you, Kanye, for charging people $$$ for this \\"ridiculousness.\\"
B000SEGMAU|5.0|I am drawn to writers who possess the ability to make me feel as though I am somehow part of their story. This author did exactly that.  The intellectual, emotional and spiritual exchanges between Morrie and Mitch were heart warming and often heart wrenching at the same time. The lessons they shared were precious gifts. How privileged we should all feel that they chose to share them with us.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Jennifer Lawrence was well-cast in her role.  Although the contrasts between good and evil are grossly overstated and the costumes, makeup and hairstyles are outrageous, the movie's plot and special effects are worth watching this movie to see.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|Good way to finish the series, although the way they finally got back home was rushed. You could tell they cut the franchise short and decided at the last minute to end it. Also, they began to include sex in the dialog and scenes, which was not the case in all the other SG-1 and Atlantis versions.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Susan Cain has done her research! This book is enlightening and informing. I believe she can change lives with this information. I declare myself a happy introvert with new knowledge that makes me feel okay about that. While the book is filled with her knowledge and advice it never comes off as too \\"research-y\\" or \\"teach-y\\" ... The information is delightfully written and helpful.
B0031R5K68|2.0|The book definitively got my interest... Every second I had free I was reading a chapter...<br />Although long, the suspence was kept and so was my interest; at the middle of the book, I knew who one of the characters was, but I wasn´t prepared for the conclusion of the book... What conclusion??? Left me with the feeling of watching a fireworks show, getting bigger, bigger, awaiting for the final big blast, but there was none... the show was over
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game will keep you entertained and make you think. Hours will be spent on this puzzle of rooms. Be prepared to get addicted!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Though this book makes one think it could be based on a true story, it was lacking. The story dragged on very often and the ending left you empty. Not one of my favorites!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A fun logic puzzle, not too easy but not too frustrating. Wish there were more levels. I like the change of view in some rooms, it adds to that level.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|This movie reminded me of an old Clint Eastwood western, They even used some of the music in it.<br />It was by far the best I've seen in a wile.<br />I recomend getting it, But be sure to watch the making of the movie too. You will find it very interesting!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Fun Bingo app though it can get costly to play and unless you want to actually &#34;pay&#34;  you wont play for too long. People go in groups and bingo within 2-3 numbers.  The power ups are nice, but once one if available, you use it or lose it!  That part is lame!
0525952926|5.0|Another of Ken Follett's masterpieces!!! This man can write!! I can wait for the final book of his Trilogy!! Fantastic!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Enjoyed the book even though I had seen the movie first. The author doesn't disappoint and has the ability to keep you engaged.
B008JFUO36|4.0|This is like taking an old model apart and making something completely new with the old parts. I liked it a lot! I haven't seen anything \\"new\\" that did not take ideas from movies already made before. So for a new sci fi movie it was good. I gave it 4 stars, cuz the movie i liked a lot but not 5 cuz I have no idea why its taking so long to get it out on DVD. I just bought a new TV and I cant wait to sit in my pj's and watch it again. Whoever is manufacturing this for DVD is NOT an effective team -.-
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Though it looked pretty simple and child-like, it was a challenge!  Fun and inventive new look for &#34;Angry Birds&#34; .  a lot of new ideas and even better...ad free!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A beautifully written story. The characters become real people that are familiar and are known to you. You care what happens to each one. Gosselin weaves he many threads of each of their lives into an intricate tapestry.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Even though I had seen the movie, this book was well worth the time to read. The author's style is interesting, and keeps you interested. Well done!
044024613X|4.0|Our book club chose this book.  It was a fast read with lots of twists and making you wonder what you would do under this family's circumstances.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Misunderstood this one and cant play it cus I don't have &#34;friends&#34; on the kindle and apps blocked on FB :S  Looks to be a bit &#34;blah&#34; in its graphics/animation
B0098QBEXO|5.0|i found it to be a brilliant little gem, in the very same way as I have found other, little known, British films, such as The Mother or The Trip.  I'm simply bummed that I can't purchase the DVD here in the States, because it's only available in the PAL format.
0679805273|5.0|Much cheaper than book stores. Bought for preschool graduation for the teachers to write my daughter a message. Love it!
B001I45UFC|5.0|Great book and another great read!  This book was illustrative and was something that I couldn't wait to read and finish.
B009POCG2C|5.0|Love Clint and love Justin.  I loved the romance that was sweet instead of raunchy.  Clint has the rough, grumpy and yet tender old man down pat.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Ok like the title says this is my first review ever and i have bought and read more then 200 books off amazon kindle....I feel like a child wrote this book i mean come on a kid goes from a sheep hearder to a member of the royal family in two days pretty impressive huh but thats not it he also has the king to be{the kings daughter}fall for him, he kills a beast from hell then saves his enemy from dieing, i build boats for a living so im no writer but this book is for children.
0345803485|1.0|If I had read this when I was a naive pre-teen, I would have been interested.  So many books have been written about kinky sex, did the whole country miss them?  What about Ann Rice and her Beauty books?  There is a lot of great erotica out there, but this book is not among the greats.  The author's experience with bondage is obviously limited to her husband tying her to the bed post once when they were drunk.  Might want to do some research next time.<br /><br />I can't believe this was a best seller.<br /><br />Exquisitely bad!
B00821OX98|4.0|Decent show. Not my favorite end of the world series, but a worthwhile substitute for Revolution and Walking Dead while they aren't on
0061245097|3.0|[...]    Brought to you by reviewer Heidi    *Beware of possible Spoilers*    It's been over four years since Cat left Bones, in what she thought was the only way to keep him safe.  She still misses him every day, but knows that things between the two of them would never have worked; at least that's what she tries to tell herself anyway.    She lives for her work killing the bad vampires and tries to fool herself into pretending she's happy.  And, it somewhat works until she's in her friend, Denise's, wedding and Bones is a groomsman.  All her old feelings come rushing back and old jealousies as well when the bridesmaid he's paired with is all over him.  She tries to pretend it doesn't bother her and to ignore the situation.  But Bones will not be ignored.  He corners her and makes sure that she sees reason.    Eventually, he talks her into giving their relationship another try, but with her stipulation of taking things slow, although she can't force herself to stay celibate with him for long (who can blame her?).  They have to face-off with Cat's mom and her boss and co-workers to make them all accept that Bones is in her life, but Cat realizes that she has never been happier now that he's back and their relationship is worth standing up for.    \\"You called her Kitten? And she let you? She put me in a coma for three days when I called her that! My balls never recovered from her smashing then into my spine!\\"    \\"And well she should have,\\" Bones agreed. \\"She's my Kitten, and no one else's\\"    Over the years, Bones has been offered several contracts on Cat, which he accepted and then killed the people placing the hit.  But there is a new one out there that he can't figure out who is behind, not to mention his own sire, Ian, now wants to own Cat.  Bones will do whatever it takes to keep his `kitten' safe, even if it means letting himself be captured by the men that are trained to kill his species.    Jeaniene Frost sucks you right in again in this book, the sequel to Halfway to the Grave.  Even the beginning before Bones comes back is interesting enough to keep you reading, but once that sexy vampire makes his appearance, you just don't want to put the book down!    Bones is his usual confident, cocky, sexy self, but with a different hair color.  I loved reading his love for Cat and was just surprised it took him over four years to find her, no matter what Don did.  I absolutely loved Bones and Cat's mom squaring off after Cat and Bones decided to give their relationship another try.    \\"You know what your problem is, Justina? You're in desperate need of a good shag.\\"    I downed a gulp of gin to cover the laugh that forced its way out. God, if I'd thought that once, I'd thought it a thousand times!    She let out an outraged huff. Bones ignored it.    \\"Not that I'm offering you one myself, mind. My days as a whore ended back in the seventeen hundreds.\\"    His little jabs are always humorous and of course I LOVED him standing up for Cat and not letting her mom trash talk her.    \\"I thought you'd gotten over your whoring when you left him, Catherine, but it seems you only postponed it.\\"    Bones' face turned to stone, and he answered her even before I could snap out an indignant response.    \\"Don't you ever speak to her that way again.\\" There was pure warning in the whip of his words. \\"You can call me any name you like and more, but I will not stand by while you slander her out of your own ignorance.\\"    And then of course there is always chapter 32, the hot sex to make vampire Annette jealous as her punishment for fighting with Cat.  Fangs and lube anybody?  I never thought that would be such a tempting combination before.    \\"Now I am short on some props, and there isn't nearly enough time in one night to run through all the ways I've fantasized about taking you, but I promise you this...\\" His voice deepened, \\"You'll be scandalized in the morning when you can think again.\\"    For the most part I really did love this book, but Icould have done without the whole ghoul stuff at the end of the book and my overall rating of this book suffered because of it. To me it kind of ruined the climactic scene with Bones, Cat, & Ian facing off.  I would much rather the book have ended there or with a nice romantic ending between Bones and Cat and saved the ghoul stuff for the next book.  Either way, I love this series and can't wait to read more!    This review and more at openbooksociety dot com
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This was a very interesting book; I had on my kindle for reading while traveling. Didn't finish on one trip; six months later finished. It is unusual to remember the story line and characters after that period of time. I would recommend this book.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Amazingly, even with the knowledge of where the story goes I find myself completely in the dark with the writing.  Great acting and storyline, the artistic direction is fantastic... but most of all, the show just makes me hungry!
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Visually, it seemed like it would have been great to see in theaters in 3D, but without that, it wasn't that good. The story line was soso and some thing about it just wasn't there. Wasn't entertaining, almost didn't finish watching it.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Skyfall was a good modern James Bond movie, with some neat throwbacks and acknowledgement to the older James Bond technology and movies.  Personally, I probably prefer the older Bond movies a bit better, but this one certainly has a lot of good action and intrigue.  Can't go wrong here.
0385342055|5.0|I really don't understand the truckload of negative reviews about this book. I have read all of Sophie Kinsella's books and read this last because I expected it to be the worst. To my delight, I enjoyed it as much if not more than the others! It was so funny and even occasionally brought a tear to my eye. Perhaps not everyone understands or appreciates the satire that is Becky Brandon nee Bloomwood. She is a contradiction in and of herself, and even though she manages to make a mess of things, in the end she always comes out on top because of her warm heart and good intentions. Kinsella writes books that are an escape and this is no exception. Of course Becky doesn't learn from her mistakes in every book - that's what makes us love her! What kind of book would it be if it was about a reasonable, perfect, self-disciplined woman with no vices or temptations? I really hope Kinsella continues the series. I have loved all of them! Don't let the negative reviews turn you off this delightful book.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read the Hunger Games because of all the hype it received in the movie theater.  I thought the book was good.  It was compared to Twilight....I didn't get that connection.
B00881VLCE|4.0|It is quick and easy to use.  Reasonable price for several puzzles.  PUZZLES create beautiful picture.  Will purchase more in the future.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My daughter and I love working together to solve these. She is nine and loves it. She figures more out by herself than I thought she would.
B009GXHOW4|4.0|Well when I get on it it gags it says I can't play it because minecraft is being played to much on internet I feel like I just got a game for nothing.
0380725398|5.0|I read this book some years ago (it belonged to my mother) and ordered a copy.  This is a great story -- it holds your interest.  Love the characters, too.  Francis Davey is absolutely fascinating.
B004478AS4|5.0|Almost feels like an allegory but so informative written through the tribe's eyes on their life and the social transition that occurs in the second to third part of the book when the missionaries came.
B008ROGJ2Y|3.0|Fun flick to sit around with a room full of kids/teens with - you don't have to pay much attention to it and can joke the whole way through it.
141659521X|5.0|Our family is so saddened having learned of Vince Flynn's passing today. Not only was he a fantastic writer...we absolutely loved every single one of his books...all keepers...our favorite author...He was a very wonderful man!!  Mitch Rapp was part of our book clubs, our adult children's favorite author as well... his newest book each year was a Christmas present under the tree that each family member knew they were getting...even though I knew they would sneak to read at the library because they couldn't wait until Christmas day.  They, of course, would have to request his newest book months before it's release date.  If not the list of requests were always in the hundreds they then would have to wait until Christmas Day to find out the newest Mitch saga!! I would catch whispers, Mitch Rapp this and Mitch Rapp that.  Something I so truly enjoyed.  For me it was such a treat for me to read after the holidays and all was cleaned up, stored away for the next holiday season.  I wouldn't let anyone mention anything about his newest book release until I finished every page. A nice family tradition. Each member of our family has every book he has written.  They will all be read again and again.  We are just so sad!!<br />Here is just one of many news link about Vince that captures what a great person he is:  http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2013/06/19/mn-author-vince-flynn-dies-at-47/<br />We are just so saddened by this loss of not only our favorite author but to a truly good, good, man.  :(
B003EYVXUU|4.0|This is not the best movie I have ever seen, but it is worth a watch.  I have never seen a poor performance out of Richard Jenkins and I have been very impressed by the young Chloe Moretz in both this movie and Kick-Ass.  The only people I would not recommend this movie for are anyone looking for a full on vampire movie because that is not what this movie was going for.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|Was good throughout but came home with the thunder and earned itself 5 stars. Might have to read the rest of the series
B002VEEAYA|4.0|Very riveting plot.  I really enjoyed all the twists and turns and plot changes.  Great thriller with very good acting and beautiful scenery.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is a very addictive show.  Every woman can relate one way or the other!  Julianna Margulies is wonderful!  Love it!
B008Y73940|4.0|I thought it was witty and cool. First picture I ever saw by that McConaughey guy. He acts ok, for someone I never heard of.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|Really cute movie! Better than expected! Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are a wonderful couple in this heartfelt movie of the year.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Can't stay in a bad mood if you listen to this cd!  Sing loud and proud! Who cares if other drivers stare!
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|Ok so I read a few reviews about this movie.  A lot of people didn't like it.  I am here to tell you they are wrong.  I thought the effects were good.  Had a good cast.  I've seen Jeremy Brenner in other movies.  I think he is a real good actor.  A lot of the cast members are good and have seen them in other movies.  If you like witches, guns, fighting and spells.  This movie is for you...
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Watching this movie made me fill-up with nostalgia and tears, as characters of my youth were vividly brought to life. The most surprising part, to me, was the consistency of each character with the graphics-game-play with the console and year of publication of each game. From PacMan to King Koopa, I was transported to my early days and enjoyed very much seeing these guys come to life.<br /><br />Puns, jokes, references, this movie has a real punch-in-the-face sense of humor, making you laugh out loud.<br /><br />The in-depth message of the movie is also cleverly interwoven. Ralph desperately seeks to find \\"himself\\" and try to become what he thinks he must become to feel like he matters. Jealous of Fix it Felix Jr., Ralph tries to find a medal so he may receive the common praise from the neighbors. The journey Ralph goes through is called going \\"Turbo\\", when a character invades another game and literally crashes it. Ralph's journey teaches him that the real medal is the one you find within, by understanding who you are and the importance of accepting yourself as such:<br /><br />\\"There is no one else I'd rather be than me.\\"<br /><br />Absolutely amazing.
159463176X|3.0|This book was not nearly at the high level as his two previous books. I was disappointed in it rather boring
0756405890|5.0|The Name of the Wind is a beautiful novel. I don't know what exactly I expected coming into it, but it wasn't a tale like this. It's a grounded universe yet it's brimming with passion. After experiencing this wonderful world I can honestly say there's nothing else out there quite like it.<br /><br />Setting<br /><br />It's a fantasy novel that doesn't play up the fantasy tropes like so many others these days. There are no elves or dwarves or other races other than human. And what fantastical elements there are are presented almost scientifically. And even the magic doesn't really appear in gust til the second half of the novel.<br /><br />This lends to a somehow believable and convincing story, even when we eventually do see characters controlling elements, and performing magical bindings.<br /><br />Structure<br /><br />The novel has a fairly unique structure (similar to Heart of Darkness). In the first chapters, we are introduced to the protagonist, Kvoths. But we quickly move into a story told by Kvothe which essentially makes up 90% of the novel. So while it feels like a first person narrative most of the time, it's actually cloaked within third person narrative.<br /><br />This is a clever device that effectively allows us to step outside of Kvothe's story from time to time and get additional insight into his character from the point of view of others.<br /><br />But it also makes me question whether future books will share this narrative structure. For example, will Kvothe continue to tell this tale in book 3? Or will it follow him after the tale has been told, and will that third person narrative work?<br /><br />It doesn't matter as far as TNOTW is concerned. For this installment, it works wonderfully.<br /><br />Story<br /><br />The character of Kvothe is the real heart of the novel, and the story follows him from a young age. He's a likable character whose talents propel him forward in life at very abrupt speeds as he quickly picks up new skills and masters them (ala Ender in Enders Game, or Harry in Harry Potter).<br /><br />It may sound a little cliche, but I never found myself second guessing it. I was too wrapped up in Kvothe's head to care that he might be a type on the surface.<br /><br />While he might seem like a type at first glance, in reality Kvothe is a multi-level character. There are many sides to him, and they all come together to create a living person you want to follow throughout the length of the novel.<br /><br />As Kvothe grows up (relatively speaking, at the end of the novel he's still in his teens) his circumstances change from traveling performer to more desperate and trying situations to which he constantly adapts.<br /><br />It's fun to watch how his circumstances early on affect his life later. Not often do you see this attention to detail in a fantasy novel. It leads to a very natural feeling of character progression which is so good, it doesn't really feel like \\"character\\" progression at all, but like a real person sharing the story of his life.<br /><br />Style<br /><br />Mr Rothfuss can certainly sting his words together. Most of the time, the prose really work to pull you in, and when they get flowery it feels appropriate, generally because its a quote from an ancient play or text.<br /><br />The only complaint I have about his style comes when we reach a conversation that lasts more than a few pages. While the dialog itself tends to be great, the markers get repetitive. Rothfuss falls into the trap of \\"he said, she said, he said, she siad, et al.\\"<br /><br />This actually pulled me out of the story on more than one occasion, and I found myself wondering why the author didn't spend a little time to make it flow more naturally.<br /><br />I also noticed that he depended on a few phrases a bit too often. About 2/3rds of the way through the novel, I started laughing every time I read the phrase \\"...more than anything in the world\\". A little variety with these sorts of sentiments would have been nice, but over all my stylistic complaints are rather minor.<br /><br />So, it's a Series...<br /><br />So here's the big one. The Name of the Wind is book one in an unfinished series, and it ends without any sense of finality at all. It does it's best to wrap up an unfinished story, but by the time you put the book down, it doesn't feel complete.<br /><br />The author did add a situation at the end to serve as end transition, but it doesn't replace a stand alone story. This is my issue with lots of series. If each book can stand on it's own, then I feel satisfied when I put the book down. With TNOTW, and so many other books part of a series, I felt like I was left hanging.<br /><br />However, I also found myself eager to read the next. That being said, I'm waiting til the last book is released.<br /><br />Overall<br /><br />In the end, The Name of the Wind is a fantastic read. In fact, i found myself recommending it to people every chance I had. I had a few minor quibbles, but even they didn't serve to dilute my vigor for this story. Going off the pure enjoyment I felt moment by moment, I would say buy this book in a heartbeat!<br /><br />However, if you want the feeling of completeness by the end, then you need to be aware that you're in it for the long haul. You have two more books to read before the semblance of resolution, and the last isn't done yet.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Suits is combines a new case for each episode. Running in tandem with a new case per episode, ongoing season long internal affairs at a exclusively Harvard law firm. The characters of the show slowly reveal their true nature towards the firm as a whole, as well as to each other.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Bought this after I got hooked on the HBO series. Wish I had read it first! It's even better than the show itself (although the show does stay pretty true to the book).
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I looked forward to going to bed every night because I could read A Higher Call. Written in straightforward prose, it's in-depth interviewing and research is obvious. The book also sheds light on the German perspective during WWII and that not all of the Luftwaffe and Wermacht were Nazis. The meeting of the American and German pilots many years after the war can only be attributed to a cosmic purpose mere humans will never comprehend.
1781162646|3.0|This is a nice book, but if it wasn't king's, i probably wouldn't finish it. the story is boring, the main character is boring, there wasn't any real ghost story and no real mystery.<br />the best thing that i can say about this book is that it wasn't as long as king's other books.
B002PHVAQY|1.0|Without plugging in, turning the volume up, I can hear it hizzing!<br /><br />It only works well when the volume is down around 20% to 25%.  Turning above and it start humming.
B00BMQTY3U|5.0|Amazing album! Charles has a James Brownesque voice and his energy is infectious. Always puts a smile on my face.
B00821OX98|5.0|The plot if this show is great. They cover a lot of bases and keeps you hook. Don't want to say to much to give anything away, but you will be suck in after the first three episodes.
B0036JU6CY|5.0|If you haven't seen it I would highly recommend you purchase it as soon as possible. Buy it now. Like right now.

B003VIWO8Y|5.0|This is how he remember all went down but, who is to know, if most of them were on so many drugs that is a miracle they can write a book.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|This is one of those films that feels like it should be attached to a holiday.  Such a fun movie, filled with fantastic characters and great actors.  My favorites are Lionel Jeffries (as Grandpa Potts), Robert Helpmann (as the child catcher), and Anna Quale (as Baroness Bomburst).  The music is great, in spite of what some critics have said (I also have the original soundtrack which I play often).  Caractacus Potts' (Dick Van Dyke) labor saving devices are hilarious (I especially like the hair cutting machine).  The bumbling spies have some of the best lines (\\"pardon me for protruding.\\").  There are villains aplenty but the best has to be the child catcher (who owes a great deal of his performance to Margaret Hamilton!).  This film is a joy from start to finish.  It begs to be watched often.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This new 5 ft. USB to Micro-USB Cable is the perfect length to use on your Kindle Fire. The old one was much too short. This shows that Amazon and Kindle have listened to our feedback about wanting a longer cable!
B0063M22QO|4.0|I have loved this game. for years and this is a nice version<br />. Fun. Layouts and the touch is robust and responsive

B004XQYBA2|5.0|Unfortuately, I have only used this once & it worked well, its a prog that I keep for holidays & travel times so far so good.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|No reason for this movie to be made nor to be watched. I only did it out of loyalty to the first 3, the franchise has veered so far off that I'm not coming back. No character development or point to the story, they introduce characters that seem to be significant but you have no idea why probably due to over editing.  I guess you could say the point of the story was to have the son call him John and then have one break through moment where he calls him Dad.  There that's the whole movie.  Like watching a loved one die slowly and painfully, thanks Hollywood.
B005544TRQ|3.0|This is the season of dramas with heroes with special skills. Burn Notice has Michael Westen, White Collar has Neal Caffrey, but what does Suits have? Unfortunately, the protagonist of the show is clever but whiny and represents little more than a novelty. The lawyer in the show who mentors the protagonist is already Peter Burke and Neal Caffrey in one, which does not really leave any room for anyone else. The show can be fun to watch, but not novel.
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|Was free app of the day so I thought I'd check it out. The sounds are great as well as the images but it crashes with seconds of opening it. Useless.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|Simply great. I've been a fan since the beginning, and this rates right up there. As usual, takes a few listens. That Devendorf drummer guy is like no other. I know nothing about drummers, but to me, he is fantastic. Another thing...if you ever have the chance to see these guys live, don't miss them. They really \\"rock out\\". I took my wife (Ms. Motown) to a show a couple of years ago. As soon as they started I simply nodded my head and flipped her a thumbs up. She did the same. Looking forward to seeing them again in September with Frightened Rabbit. Now that should be a show. One last thing...I was just listening to \\"Slipped\\" #9 in the car and started crying. Laugh if you want. Great band.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|This movie surpasses the previous ones by far.  Jeremy Renner is a much better (and believable) covert agent than Matt Da-mon.  The fact that this is not Ludlum's work is a sore spot, but overall this movie delivers where the previous ones did not. The story is intriguing, the acting is phenomenal, and the continuity to the previous movies works very well.
B00CY1JUW2|4.0|After a long break and lots of rescheduled release dates, Q.O.T.S.A. have given us another fantastic Rock n' Roll gem straight out of the hot sands of the desert. If you're a fan of Queens o.t. Stone Age's earlier material, you'll love this record. It has an open and looser form that nicely blends just enough pretty in with the dirty and shrill elements we've come to love.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|Krakauer gets it right every time. A great mix of Chris McCandless' story and John Krakauer's. Love love love it.
B002M7A79S|5.0|Based on great reviews from other viewers, my better half and I watched the whole TV series first and then the movie.  Same cast and mostly the same quality, good continuity for a TV show transitioning to movie format.  There are definitely some surprises in the plot.  I wish they would make a few more of these.
B0007939NO|5.0|Gene Kelly & Cyd Charisse are stunning together. Something wonderful. Pure magic. You can enjoy the brilliance of their amazing dance talent.
B00D4FDNIO|4.0|This music works with sunshine or gray overcast. These fun little dance gems will keep your head bobbing to the beat in your car or at work, and your feet won't be able to stop on the dance floor. This record is filled with great collaborators like Sam Smith, Jessie Ware and Edward Macfarlane. Enjoy.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm not sure why this book has received bad reviews. I was really expecting something terrible, but once again I was trusted into the world of Gideon and Eva to become totally smitten. If you're a. Crossover fan  I think you will enjoy this as much as I did. Can't wait for the next installment!

B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Great movie.  I enjoyed the movie because of the compassion and love expressed by older sister and her determined spirit to survive the game and go home to her family.

0062255657|4.0|\\"Adults follow paths. Children explore. Adults are content to walk the same way, hundreds of times, or thousands; perhaps it never occurs to adults to step off the paths, to creep beneath rhododendrons, to find the spaces between fences.\\"<br /><br />This was the one quote that really made me stop reading the novel, The Ocean at the End of the Lane by author Neil Gaiman and really consider all the profound truth that may lie within the simple quote. It is very true and it takes the imagination of a child to really appreciate all the things that Neil brings to life in this one. An adult would try to reason there way through this, while a child would just accept what is happening and move forward without needing to know why.<br /><br />In this dark, fairy tale story, monsters are really and the things you think are real, really are. In fact I am reminded of Tim Burton's movies as I read through this one. At first, it doesn't make a lot of sense much like a child explaining something out of the ordinary. You just need to stop over analyzing it and just take it as face value and continue to dig deeper.<br /><br />In this one the narrator, who's name I don't believe is ever mention is remembering back to a childhood experience that happened to him when he was only seven. Now much older he has returned to the place when the horror began and where the nightmare was something he truly lived and not dreamed. It begins with the death of the boy's only companion, a kitten that was accidentally run over and killed by their border, an Opal Miner who thinks simply replacing the cat will appease the damage he has done. This is the beginning of a not so happy story. Much like A Series of Unfortunate Events, Neil Gaiman takes his much deeper and to a darker place where evil now has an open door into the current world in which to find a foothold in solving what people believe makes them happy. To do so, requires a bit of finesse, but one our character can see through.<br /><br />It's when he follows his father one morning when their car is reported missing that he discovers the body of the Opal Miner in the car and thus introduces us to the women in the Hempstock household who have the uncanny ability to solve things that no one else can see. He is soon befriended by Lettie, an eleven year old girl who has been eleven for quite some time and has a prophetic vision to what is really happening in town. Lettie and her family live at the end of the lane and care for the boy until his father comes calling for him. Soon he finds out that Lettie and her family have far more powers than he could ever imagine and thus the novel turns into a darker more menacing version of Alice in Wonderland meets Bridge to Terabithia.<br /><br />I received The Ocean at the End of the Lane by Neil Gaiman compliments of William Morrow, a division of Harper Collins Publishers for my honest review and received no monetary compensation for a favorable one. This is not recommended for young teens and falls in the upper young adult category to be age appropriate. I would have to say the writers ability to pull off an exceptional fantasy tale with a dark twist is wonderful and I'd rate this one a 4 out of 5 stars. It is a surprisingly thin novel that draws out the story to feel like you've read a whole lot more pages than you did, a mark of an exceptional writer. I look forward to reading more from this author and fully enjoyed his unique writing style. This is the very same author who wrote Coraline, so you can prepare yourself for what you are about to find inside.when he follows his father one morning when their car is reported missing that he discovers the body of the Opal Miner in the car and thus introduces us to the women in the Hempstock household who have the uncanny ability to solve things that no one else can see.

B00947N6D8|5.0|Wonderful movie for the kids and a delight for adults as well. This is a beautiful movie that has a great storyline.
B005LAIIKI|2.0|I went into this film hoping to really enjoy it.  I'm so glad that I decided to rent instead of buy... I won't be watching Django again.  Some of the actors are excellent, but the story and the bloated racial themes really turned me off.  About halfway through, I wanted to stop watching.  I would recommend Inglorious Basterds over this if you are a Trantino fan.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game!  Very addicting!  Not so difficult, but it does make you pause and think! Highly recommended! I really like the escape games, and this one is at the top!
B00DF0POXA|1.0|Sucks just like the rest of this garbage out now-a-days!!!<br />I wish I new all the different languages to say this sucks!!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I think this was Stephen King's best books. Of course since I remember when JFK was killed maybe that was why I enjoyed it so much. Those of us who remember that have wondered how things would have been if JFK has lived.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|One of the most iconic soldiers on the planet. The book jumps around a little too much for my liking but completely understandable if you have that many stories. Recommended to everyone. This is a must read for anyone.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|This was it. The single twist just didn't pack much of a &#34;wow&#34; factor. Performances were good, but the movie felt needed its supporting players better developed.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|Movie is good, the film quality from amazon instant video on iPad is great.  However, when connected iPad to TV, it was not able to play on the TV screen, THAT IS A BIG, HUGE discount from watching the movie at home because it is hard to enjoy the movie with the family trying watch it from a tiny screen.
B003TWONOK|5.0|Absolutely wonderful. This is my favourite book by Nora Roberts. I'll be reading this book again. Love the dogs! The dog search and rescue storyline was fascinating.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I loved how this historical period was recreated so that we can see how the king was manipulated to achieve other's ambitions.  It also depicts how power driven the king was.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Easy to read and I didn't want to put it down. As with all of Albom's book they make you think about what is truly important in life!
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Classic Tolkien! Beautiful scenery, rounded characters, amazing soundtrack and leaves you wanting more! Can't wait till the 2nd to come out!
B0064MGU98|1.0|Maybe it's just the pilot, but I didn't think the storyline was that good.  And for someone who hadn't practiced law in years, to get a junior associate position on a once-high-profile case, really?  Anyway, I'm just going by the pilot, and it wasn't that good to get me to watch the rest of the series. Kind of predictable and boring at times. Okay to watch of there's nothing else on.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|I got the app but found it was not what I needed so I really can't say one way or the other about how it works.
B00821OX98|5.0|SciFi at its best. Taut drama, engaging characters, good dialog - and a plot! There are, of course, special effects but they work with the story instead of overwhelming it.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I really enjoyed getting the movie so fast and at such a great price. The packaging kept it safe and dry from all the rain we have been having. Looking for more movies now.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a VERY addictive game. What is great is that it is loads of challenges without being overwhelming. It's nice when developers get it right. Mobigrow will have me looking at more of their games now.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I went on tour with my band recently and was traumatized by my phone constantly dying so I bought this puppy when I got back and it is AMAZZZZING!! I can now charge my phone in my purse and not have to stress on finding an outlet. This is such a great purchase, it charges my tablet [Samsung Galaxy 10.1] and my phone or any phone that can charge off a usb cord. I got it fast and it is wonderful. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
B000HZD168|5.0|Superb filmmaking and great performances by all the cast. &#34;Wrath of Khan&#34; definitely holds a candle to the original series.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|A Bush/Cheney & Blair-era tale about the venality and amorality of private security contractors and their government enablers, and about their nearly absolute insulation from scrutiny and consequences.
B00C7JFIRC|1.0|I was so excited about this movie. I thought that it would be fun and have a good story. Instead it was miscast and no fun. The story was hokey. I didnt have any fun songs. It seemed like forever to end. I did like the opening credits though. Rent it and forget it.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|I downloaded the movie to watch on my Samsung Tablet while on the plane but unfortunatelyit would not download on my Samsung tablet so I didn't get a chance to watch it on the plane like I wanted to. We ended up watching it at home on the Wii.. Great movie.. Amazon just need to add the Samsung Galaxy Tab to their approved devices.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|This game would be great if the glue credits I won or purchased would show up. As it is its very disappointing. I'm level capped through no fault of my own
0811879542|5.0|This unique book is the favorite of my preschooler and toddler nieces, not to mention their mom. It even travels in the car with them when they leave the house. The book is simple but highly creative and interactive.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Love the mock interview format, and the international scope. Made the (very silly, really) threat of a zombie apocolypse seem very real.<br /><br />Brooks takes you through the post-apocolypse in an almost documetary style, &#34;interviewing&#34; those affected by and that had an effect on the &#34;war&#34;. Just terrific escapist fun, great poolside or long plane ride companion!
B005HEE60E|5.0|This Version has remastered footage, as well as new effects that remain faithful to the original designs.  The results are a great looking show that won't scare away newbies because of outdated SFX.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is amazing. This game is so fun and u really must work it to be good at it. Very fun.
B00AG297GK|4.0|My wife and I were hesitant to see this movie having seen Sacha Baron Cohen's other efforts, I mean the guy has a good sense of humor, just figured it would be more of the same with him being a mock foreigner again. We were pleasantly surprised !  Actually I think this was the funniest of all his movies and it exhibited a lot of social and political commentary in a humorous way. I guess this is what some people call &#34;raunchy&#34; humor but to us we just call it &#34;funny&#34;.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Why do I have to give this one star? Why not zero? About the most childish thing I have ever read, or, attempted to - confession, I could not finish this tripe.<br /><br />One thing i did love about the book: a few pages in when the protaganist was named - Anastasia Steele - I had a genuine 'laugh-out-loud' moment.  Those are too rare.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|This arrived broken and does not fit my iPhone 5. The top portion which is meant to attach to the tripod is completely broken off and can't be reattached. It looks like it may have been superglued on. It's $4, so you get what you pay for.  Not a fan.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|If you like 'John Mac Clain' (Bruce Willis) you will enjoy watching all the drive hard action.  The biting comments are there, as is the survival is always an option.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This book offered a pretty unique magic system, culture, and world. The story reminded me a bit of buddy urban fantasy series like Lies of Locke Lamore while written with a narrator telling his story to a writer (similar to King Killer series). I couldn't put this book down. It was fantastic.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|the first rule about fight club is you dont talk aout fight club.<br />the second rule about fight club is you dont talk about fight club.<br />so I wont talk about fight club, I'll just tell you to read it.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I can't put it down. Always thought biography reading is boring . Not this one. Thanks for bringing it to kindle
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is simply great television and is most deserving of all the awards and accolades it has received. Love it!
B004I744AS|5.0|Power of words and to be able to hold that power at your finger tips is more<br />Power whether you need to know meaning of a word or the correct spelling<br />It's there for the asking just when you thought dictionaries had went out of style<br />they reinvent themselves digital in 2013
B004HD61KE|5.0|As usual, a Rollins book is one you just can't put down!!  This one was exciting with a little history and science thrown in!
B001KT6JPA|4.0|... that reminds me of the feeling I got when I did not want to look under my bed during the night as a child.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I absolutely love this movie!  It's romantic, magical, just absolutely wonderful!  Keira Knightley was definitely the right pick for the role of Elizabeth Bennet!
0312370849|5.0|This book was quite a revelation to me  and again a call to awareness that man can create evil beyond imagination.  At age 68, I thought I knew a lot about what happened,though my father never talked about the war, I knew only what was taught in public school......in truth, I had a cursory understanding as I suspect, is true of most Americans.  Whether the mechanics of the book could have been better, to critic on the points of weakness, etc....none deter the reader from following the tale to the end.  The war was ugly and reminds us of how easily atrocity grows and becomes the face of evil. It was compelling and thought provoking and is on my list of books everyone should read.  And it is readable!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very challenging, sometimes difficult.  But fun nevertheless.  Would recommend to those who like to use their brain little bit....fun game, looking forward to playing more levels.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|love how the levels work where upgrades make the early stuff easier.  good for moms and kids too.  having gun.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|good acting<br />Good screenplay<br />Great special effects<br />great casting<br />the best childrens book ever written for adults and a movie for everyone.
B00CWV8TIU|2.0|Too slow, i couldn't even finished it. Not what I expected. But if you like slow movies you might enjoy it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This was one of the best possible games that could have been created. The only thing I thought that could have been better is give more money in the beginning.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I had a very good experience with this title from Amazon.  It streamed effortlessly through my Roku... I have had problems with other channels on my Roku but never Amazon.  And of course I love  Oz the Great and Powerful.  It was an excellent movie, and I have seen it twice - once in the theater and then last night when we had some kids over.
B00271DNP4|5.0|good acting<br />Good screenplay<br />Great special effects<br />great casting<br />the best childrens book ever written for adults and a movie for everyone.
B00ANYJ3NI|3.0|I was hoping for some sort of revelation and bought this book on the advice of my course instructor.  Good for a citing source if you don't have any others.  Otherwise, it was like watching the whole train wreck all over again.  The stories and people are supposedly real, and though their names mostly were unfamiliar, their actions were too familiar.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I loved this app!!! The visuals and graphics are beautiful; the music very soothing. All was well until 4 days ago when it suddenly, inexplicably stopped responding. Since I have spent real money playing , I'm not happy at all. I have notified customer service numerous times, to no avail. So I guess you could say I'm pretty pissed off!!!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is an intermediate level game and should probably not be tackled by a first-timer. For that I strongly recommend &quot;the carnival dark arcana&quot;. For those not familiar with this type of game, it consists of a plot element involving the supernatural. In order to advance the plot you face a series of mind-bending puzzles which you have to solve. It's the intensity of these puzzles which make this particular game harder to solve. The level of graphics and quality are top-notch. For those who are faint hearted there are some surprising chills also.<br /><br />Like their other games this one is free to try. Once you decide you like the game you have to pay to unlock the rest of it. One sour note: the main page has you to believe that for buying this one or that one that your next one is at a discount. How wrong that is, and wouldn't that be nice. On the plus side every game I have actually bought from this company has been totally worthwhile. On the minus side they have no concept of customer loyalty.
B007FZ7QZA|5.0|I ordered this cd last year and I was very pleased with it ! I love Chris Brown and I cant wait to get his cd X
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|My grandson loves it, easy for him to play, i enjoy watching him play. he loves running from the bear.
B00BTHWFEC|4.0|There isn't a whole lot I can add to the favorable opinions left on this site about this amazing new album. I have thoroughly enjoyed this and am playing it as I type this.<br /><br />So, my gripes are not about the great music, but the lack of music in the format I choose to buy.<br /><br />I primarily buy my music on records. This new Sabbath album is issued on double 180gm LP's which is fine. There are eight songs, which is also fine. What is not fine is the fact that the CD has three additional songs totaling approximately fifteen more minutes. Fifteen minutes of music that could have EASILY fit on this double album. There are only TWO songs per side, with dead wax filling half the sides. It would be different if this had been issued at 45 speed for improved fidelity, but it is the standard 33 1/3.<br /><br />So for me to have the three extra songs, I cannot have them on an LP, I have to spend MORE money buying them individually or buy the CD. I feel slighted, especially since the LP costs around $10 more.<br /><br />A band of Black Sabbath's stature should certainly stand up for their fans and demand that all fans, choosing all formats get all the music, not just some.<br /><br />I want to blame the greedy record companies, as we all know there has been a massive record resurgence in recent years. But my heart sinks a bit when I think, are the members of Black Sabbath a party to this, which amounts to an underhanded money grab? I certainly hope not.<br /><br />I apologize for this not being more about the quality of the music. I just felt that I should articulate to some degree that if the record buying public continues to support the resurgence of the LP format, then the record companies and the bands should give us exactly what is offered on CD.<br /><br />By the way, the album comes with an MP3 code, which allows only the eight songs on the record version, but lists all eleven songs on the CD version. Talk about adding insult to injury.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|horrible game made me restart and erased all my data at level 18 don't download dought the makers will read this if they do they need to fix it
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|I read the reviews, and thought to see if I was one of the few this app would work for. I wasn't  app stopped working within a minute.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|I was recommended to this book by a good friend and no kidding, its one of the most motivational and practical business books out there.  I will echo other reviewers who have accurately compared this book to Rich Dad and Think and Grow Rich.  Every high school student should be given a copy.  5 Stars,
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game definitely gets a thumbs up from this peanut gallery. I even find myself spending way too much time playing this game in the bathroom at work!-
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It is a fun game. It needs more levels. I will play again once more levels are added. Hurry up and add levels
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This games of the room is a fun game and keeps you guessing at all turns of the levels I think k it is great
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|It is one of my &#34;most favorite&#34; movies.  I like the story line, especially the subtle reference to reincarnation.  It makes one think.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is the best mahjong game I've played on the Kindle. The graphics are good, the gameplay is smooth, no problems there. You're rated kind of like Angry Birds, where you get a one, two, or three star rating at the end of the game. It's fairly hard to get stars on this game. You have to solve a board in under 6 minutes to even get one star. It doesn't matter too much though, you still get to continue to the next puzzles even with no stars. Good Luck!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It's ok but hard to see the numbers on the Kindle.  I've only opened it once but will try again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|so fun!! really makes ya think! and I have realized I'm not as smart as I thought lol. think I'm getting addicted
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|I'm gonna say this Yeezus is by far the worst album I ever heard in my 24 years of living with that being said I listened to Born Sinner and was surprised at J. Cole for his second LP there are some great songs on here, as well as the production my favorite is \\"Rich N......\\" That song is pure fire, I also like the samples on this album like \\"Forbidden Fruit\\" feat K. Dot was pretty good being that they sampled ATCQ \\"Electric Relaxation\\" another song that was sampled was \\"Da Art Of Story Telling Pt. 1\\" by OutKast which Mr. Cole titled \\"Land Of The Snakes\\" which also is a favorite of mine \\"Let Nas Down\\" was a standout on the album that guy who is playing the saxophone needs a raise because that was beautiful those are just some of my favorites songs no need for a long speech just go get the album support J. Cole not Kanye West.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|This version is not for playing alone.  I'm not on Facebook so it really doesn't work for me.  Nice tutorial in the beginning since I had no idea about some of the birds or the extra's.
B005JE1KFG|5.0|I had read the previous books leading up to this one and found some old friends in it. I really like the new twists and turns this book takes. If you like Riobin Hobb you will like this book, it continues the fantasy saga.
B00AKFG15S|2.0|it's obvious that the author is turning what began as a quite readable story (only time will tell) into a boring series.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this version of Angry Birds!  Really fun to see the birds fly away as their cages are hit and opened!
B000FCK65W|5.0|A great novel about growing up poor in 1910 era Brooklyn. Graphic, startling, in the end heart warming. Sadly, little known today.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|Excellent story line and tremendous job of acting by the entire cast. Enjoyed the ending and all parts leading up to the end. Highly recommend this movie.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|My whole family loves The Walking Dead, so we had to buy the series. Product is as described, but the show IS AWESOME!
B00CA4S27W|4.0|I've been a Blackmore's Night fan for several years, have all of their albums and DVDs and have recently not been very happy with the road they had taken, getting ever farther away from their Renaissance Faire roots and ever more towards mainstream Pop and Rock.<br />We already have tens of thousands of Pop and Rock (and Country and Rap....) acts, we don't need another one.<br />What we do NOT have very many of at all are bands who take Medieval and Renaissance melodies and give them a little bit of a modern makeover - an d do it well! In fact, I can't really think of any off the top of my head who do it nearly as well as Blackmore's Night.<br />Having said that, Dancer and the Moon is definitely a step in the right direction, perhaps their best Album since Ghost of a Rose. A very nice mix of centuries-old traditional melodies, original songs and even a well-done cover of Uriah Heep's Lady in Black.<br />One thing I find a little hard to believe is that Ritchie was allegedly unaware of this song, despite having toured with UH back in the day.<br />The video commentary is a little short, but a nice bonus, and for the price, this CD/DVD set is a no-brainer!<br />I hope they continue on this path!
B0084IG8TM|2.0|I was not happy with what I got. The box came broken and the disk is scratched, the movie skips a few chapters.
B008B37CB8|5.0|Zappa and the Mothers are one of the few groups that I was not into when they were around. Their freakishness turned me off at the time. Buying and listening to this album is amazing. The creativity and musicianship is great! It's ridiculous to think that this album was made in 1966. I recommend this album to people that want to hear one of the creative geniuses at the beginning of his/their career(s).
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|\\"Hello! We are the three most powerful people in the land. We rule it wihout concern for anything beyond....OMIGOSH IS THAT A MAN?! Life is now going to be ok!\\"<br />\\"Hello, ladies! I am a slimy con man without redeeming value.\\"<br />\\"We can't wait to submit to you!\\"<br /><br />There is your show in a nutshell. I was very dissappointed. Great actors, and what should have been an excellent plot and show ruined by constant cheap 3d gags and seriously sexist and flawed personae.<br />It should have been so much more.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|Very good material and guide to live by I enjoy both books I read including The Secret recommend to everyone
B00669MFA2|4.0|I'm not a fan of this series, but have seen them all, so to have my own opinion.  I thought this was a good ending to this story, which I thought had gone on too long anyway.
B008JJM88Q|2.0|Works sometimes but it's not that hard to stump it. Don't pay for it, but fine if free. It's just ok.
B004G0SJU8|4.0|Not a cinematic masterpiece by any stretch but entertaining and worth a watch when you have nothing better to do.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoy the story lines and characters of this series.  It is a great statement that people do still crave good stories and characters to watch.  The season ending was very bothering, but obviously dramatic and riveting.  I can only hope season four can continue the standard set by the first three.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Every now and then, I venture out and seek new authors to read. Someone I have never heard of. I'm not always successful, and I guess, there's a reason why some authors are more famous than others. But every now and then, you stumble upon something great, something well-written, elegant, with an original plot that keeps you wondering what on earth (literally) has happened.<br /><br />This book was one of these. I enjoyed every page, from start to finish, and I can't wait to read book 2. I've already pre-ordered the third and final part of the series.<br /><br />Hugh Howey, you are now on my list of favorite authors!
B006IYG5HE|4.0|Scandinavian accented police mystery, If you like Harry Bosch or Wallander you should like Harry Hole, 4 stars 4 me.
B00C7JFIRC|4.0|I'm more of a visual person, so the great compute graphics and colors were the main reason I purchased this movie, versus just renting it.  I also noticed that when I watched this movie on my high-def TV, I noticed the &#34;green-screen&#34; affect more, than when I watched it on my MAC.  It is very helpful to have the brightness toward the high side to maximize the colors.  The story was good, but the script was not strong enough to make this a classic on its own; which was disappointing, because it had the potential to be.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I finished and started reading it for the second time.  A brilliant and engaging journey through the diaspora.  It opened my eyes and heart to new understandings.
B008602KQI|4.0|I was planning on not liking this movie.  Based on all of the hype surrounding the movie, I figured it would be entertaining but would likely lack a story.  I was pleasanty surprised.  There really is a story and some intriguing themes.  The movie touches on the influence of media, the impact of social classes, the toxic nature of unforgiveness and retribution, and the struggle of operating in a system that significantly devalues individuals.  With that weighty of a list of social commentary, it's also pretty entertaining.  It won't change your life, but it's worth 2 hours of your free time.
B0029LCJJS|3.0|If you are entertained by a scheming, self-centered, sex maniac, this is your series.  Not sure if this was over-done to sell the series or some sort of dramatically correct portal of the reality of the times.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game has wonderful graphics,  and adorable horses. My only issue is that it's quite glitchy. sometimes takes a while to load.
B00AG297GK|3.0|If you forget we live in a world of being politically correct, there were some good laughs here.  He just tied it all up in a neat bow at the end.
B001VNB54A|5.0|I really enjoyed this series, not as much as Band of Brothers but still a great watch. I would recommend this to anyone!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is a fun and challenging way to pass the time! Its a little short, but I'm sure it will get more challenging and longer as they add more rooms.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|It was better than I thought it would be. It took awhile to get use to the controls but I'd recommend it.
B004SDEP38|1.0|I don't know what they thought when they published this app, but it's pointless.you can't do anything.so it's off of my device
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I like seeing the real time left for particular activities on my Kindle Fire. This is great to have prior to taking your tablet on the go!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book mesmerized me from start to finish.  It was such a different perspective on most near death experiences, and it was great to hear a doctor acknowledge Heaven.  I will probably read it again.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I can see how people who haven't read the book might feel very lost and confused with this movie. I found it fun to see the book stories brought to life. A very ambitious attempt indeed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is so addictive! it is awe some. challenging but fun.  if you don't get out of the room u just keep trying and before u know it 20 minutes has gone by! I love it. not only one of the best free games ive ever had but one of the best competing with ones you pay for.  definitely get this app.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|I was looking forward to this book, as a woman in sales management.  It just didn't seem to apply to me.  Maybe more for women early in their career.  For me, I just wanted to be done reading, and move on to something more interesting.
B0076DELIG|4.0|It's always a pleasure to hang out with Harry and the LAPD Detective squad. I recommend it for the pool or beach,
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is awesome! I use it every day in the car. it is a good way to get music that you want, when you want.
1936594234|5.0|This book is so powerful that I have doubts whether Murphy was a normal human being or a prophet because what he wrote is like divine truth. Besides he uses lots of references to God.<br />This book, contrary to the Secret, uses the term \\"subconscious mind\\" and links it to an \\"infinite intelligence\\" which is possessed by none other but God, Lord of the Universe.<br />The book is more accessible literary wise and does not contain multitudes of citations from differents people that confuse the reader. Any believer in monotheism will be at ease with this book and be marvelled by the power of the subconscious mind which is fueled by the infinite abilities of God.
B003L77GH4|5.0|Ibought this product one year ago and i saw it with a lot of interst, i am thinking to see more of this.
030759565X|5.0|Several years ago--when you became able to find every recipe you could possibly want on the Internet--I decided I would purchase no more cookbooks. I made an exception for this one when I visited my daughter and we tried several of the recipes from her copy including the popcorn cookies which we baked for my grandson's birthday party. As a seasoned, old school southern home economist with years of experience feeding family, friends and professional groups, I'm difficult to impress. But Deb Perelman's approach to food preparation resonates with me for several reasons. She uses mostly simple, easy to find ingredients but often combines them in unique ways. (Did I mention the popcorn cookies?) She is obviously on a quest for subtle taste and texture combinations that are appealing yet not over the top. If you've read her blog, you know that once she has a creative idea, she's driven to experiment until she gets things reliably right. Take it from someone who has thrown away far more recipe books than most people will ever own--this one is a keeper!
1591845556|5.0|The First 20 Hours breaks down learning like no other book I've read.<br /><br />While other books like Four Hour Chef cover a lot of excellent points (mostly concepts and the 10,000 foot view of learning, I feel), this book covers the specific checklists, simple systems, and (most importantly) examples of the whole process in action from utter incompetence to \\"expert enough\\" in a subject.<br /><br />Like Josh says, with speed reading skills, the \\"how to do it\\" can be covered in an hour or so.  But the examples themselves REALLY draw out the system to help you infer more from these checklists and share the mindsets and principles behind the process.<br /><br />Buy this book and be ready to tackle that skill you've always wanted to have.
B00009XITP|5.0|this is an old movie, but very funny and i really enjoy to watch it. I hope to find others like this.
B00005YT8U|5.0|Bought this to replace another I'd misplaced.  This is a wonderful album, with music from all over the world, wonderful collaborations with other artists, and the Chieftan's impeccable musicianship.
B0030BCCB6|3.0|Unbelievable that nobody has realised so far the obvious glitches on the disc 3. First at the 20th second in the 1. track (Need your love so bad) you can hear a popping noise in the guitar sound. This is very sharp and loud, so made me disappointed with the album which would have beeen great if I am talking only about the music.<br />The next popping noises can be audible on the 8th track (Black magic woman) during the beautiful guitar sound.<br />Shame.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The ladies of The View brought this show to my attention so I had to watch. Now I am addicted......love, love, love it!!!!!!
B001XULSG6|5.0|Being Star Trek fans, my husband and I watch this one often.  It never seems to get old and we love it.
B004CLYKLI|4.0|While I don't agree completely with the author's method of parenting, I do think the work ethic and drive to succeed she has worked to instill in her daughters is amazing. I found the book very moving and thought provoking.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This looked like a game my 4 year old grandson would like, and he does.  It is also challenging for me as well. Would recommend it to anyone
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book I have read in long time, defiantly recommend this book. Has you hooked right from the very start.
B001B51B9M|5.0|Always enjoyed the uplifting performance of Debbie Reynolds and Robert Preston.  Pay particular attention to &#34;Till there was you!&#34;...it was a Beatle hit!
0525953728|5.0|As the mother of a Navy Seal, this book really touched my heart and soul.  I felt the fear in these mens hearts as that chopper went down and they didn't know whether or not they were going to live or die.  Now that my son is home I can breathe knowing that he will never be put in situations like this, but am proud of him for having served his country without thought for his own life.  I make the mistake of reading Marcus Luttrell's book &#34;Lone Survivor&#34; during my son's first deployment and almost made myself sick.  All I could do was cry.  So for all you Seal families out there, we share a very common and extremely strong bond.. And as my son says, The Only Easy Day.....Was Yesterday.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Took a while to get into, not half as good as hunger games. Worth a read though if you enjoyed hunger games
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Lots of fun and challenging. I loved it, felt good when I figured them out, and look forward to more levels. thanks for the great game!
B00CHILW64|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. Very exciting and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Very<br />emotional and you got involved in the whole story
B005EGXTL2|1.0|All I can say is what a disappointment, after the first one (hunger games) this will not live up to your expectations.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down! it was a great story! I was very pleased with the ending!<br />Definently a must read!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|You will never oversleep again. This app is loaded with settings that you can easily customize by each alarm.<br /><br />The infamous math problems are worth it too. You can change tons of settings with them. First, you can set difficulty. You can set number of problems to snooze and the number to dismiss independently. These are among many others.<br /><br /> I haven't overslept since I bought this app.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I'm not much of a fantasy or sci-if reader so I had put off reading this book but it really does have something for everyone to relate to. A great read!
B000PMG16U|4.0|If you like Star wars, if you have a great DVD player ( Oppo), this is the DVD edition you must have.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|Complete waste of time. Silly premise and even worse execution. Would not recommend.Do not know who would enjoy this movie!
B0034JGBM0|5.0|Any fan of The White Stripes needs this album. Even if you're just a fan of hones rock and roll, you need this album. Play it loud!
B000PMLFRA|4.0|If you like Star wars, if you have a great DVD player ( Oppo), this is the DVD edition you must have.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Though many say that Eccleston was too old for Billie Tyler in this season, I dont see the problem.  What about every stereotypical older man with younger woman in the movies and on TV?<br />The first episode was not the greatest - frankly - if you can make it past the first few episodes, it gets much better....and lets face it - you cant start the new version of Doctor Who without including Season 1.  Just a few yummy tidbits from this season...<br />Cassandra the last human and &#34;moisturize me&#34; - classic<br />I give you air from my lungs - another classic (same episode)<br />The Slitheen and their gas - oh my<br />Saving your dad from his own death - good episode<br />Looking into the tardis....the beginning of the end - it was great<br />Overall - They were FANTASTIC!!!
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Just when you think it's over, bam! The Doctor finds the way. I so enjoyed this season. But then again, I love every season.
B00CRMWMZ0|4.0|There are some really great tracks on this album and a couple that I'll probably always skip, like their other work. The good tracks are totally worth it though. If you're into quality synth, it's porn for your ears.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love watching the lives develop of those upstairs and downstairs. Full of great lines from those on the other side of the pond.
B007WPM4P0|1.0|I just couldn't finish watching this one given the graphic portrayals of the sexual relationship between the two principal characters.  While the relationship was central to what story line I could find (and that in itself was a challenge) I think it completely unnecessary to film the scenes in such graphic ways.  I watch LOTS of British TV and drama but just had to turn this one off!
B000FCKC4C|4.0|What is it that Mary Schmich said? Live in Northern California but leave before it makes you soft? This book is Northern California.  Read and enjoy it but don't get lost in it.  A good read everyone should experience.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I downloaded the game, and I had fun playing the game, until I had to pay for the game to continue playing.  I didn't know what to expect with regards to the price.  It wasn't too bad, although those 2 and 3 dollars do add up.<br /><br />As for the game I love it.  I hope it doesn't end and it's hard to find games just like this, most of them are junkie.
B002KEZ96Y|5.0|The Coen brother delivered another classic.  The  Cult following of this show is classic...as the tee shirts often say....The Dude Abides.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Jetpack Joyride is a fun game to play when you don't have WIFI available, or if you just want to get your anger out on a bunch of scientists!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|watched Dr. Who years ago, but have not had access to it since the newer episodes.  started watching recently and am hooked.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think it's a pretty cute game..........but I think we should have the choice of skipping the instructions. So 4 stars.  :0)
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|First of all, there's not much point in this game. You draw and guess what others drew (like Pictionary) and earn coins so you can buy colors to draw with and bombs to help you guess what people drew so you can earn more coins, but to what purpose? Draw Something Free is also a great place for bullying. After your opponent guesses your drawing, they have the option to submit a comment, and there are no word restrictions. I would not recommend this game to kids for that reason.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie was wonderful for our family! it had appropriate family humor, very little (if any) violence and great characters. we are looking forward to DM2.
B009K6DKTS|5.0|If you like Taleb's writings - you will love this book, with very interesting thoughts on how to reduce risks and how to live in an ethical way. As always he writes in his very readable and arrogant style, with its regular barrages about the economic profession.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|I've used this app for years, and it requires a lot of permissions because it does a lot of stuff (e.g.lowering volume during a call, downloading additional sounds etc.).  The app is beautiful, and $3 is MUCH cheaper than the in-app pitches I made with the Play Store version.<br /><br />I recommend it highly if you want an awesome ambience app.
B0031RS73G|5.0|Along with To Kill a Mocking bird and The Great Gatsby, this is one of my all time favourite pieces of American literature.  I say America because of the all the central characters but really it is English with an Englishman's keen observation of well to do American's at one point in time.  The 1920's.  Just wonderful. It transports you back to another time and place. And the characters are so well drawn. Particularly Larry, Elliot and Isobel. Really well written and my favourite W. Somerset Maugham book of all time.  Read it. You will love it.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|This is a &#34;HAVE to Have&#34; movie.  The end was right on target and I loved the struggle that was portrayed about Addiction and where the answer is.  Also, the &#34;results&#34; of the program were vaguely shown.
B00514HDNW|4.0|As a fan of the movie I picked this up after hearing how different it was. I liked the differences from book to movie. Matheson does a good job at developing Neville's character too. Good read
B008XG1X18|4.0|Great idea and it works but it seems to take a lot of time to review. Awesome things are on yhere if I keep looking
B0084B1T8Y|3.0|It wasn't what I was expecting.  It didn't go into the life of the boy raised by wolves as he aged!
B004YLCKEU|5.0|Well listening to the start I thought Morten sounded a bit croaky, and was a bit concerned but after the first couple of songs he got stronger and stronger and by the end of the concert he sounded at his best! Fabulous performance from all of the band, particularly loved the drummer, he was great :)<br /><br />Very sad I wasn't there and this was there last concert, perhaps another one day? I hope so :)<br /><br />Quality of this is awesome! Video and Sound quality amazing
B007SYWFRM|4.0|So far, I like the game... its a strategy based game where you collect and build a refugee camp.  It c a n be a bit slow, but it kills time.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved it.  I would recommend it to others. Glad I ordered it.  I would read it again.  Not sure it provided proof but it was compelling.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Very quick and easy read. Plenty of insight. The most genuine and refreshing character I've read in a long time.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|after a few days the game stopped working on the Iphone.<br />when it did work my boys did liked it.
0694003611|5.0|This classic book captures the attention of children old and young...it truly is a great read with good pictures, probably why it has been around since I was a youngster!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|While the vocabulary and sentence style clearly indicates that this was written for the teenage audience, the story easily wins over adults with its fast paced suspense.  Anyone who enjoys futuristic novels will devour this book.  It was hard to put down!
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Played it on Facebook and just as good here as on PC.  Try this game if you love Angry Birds.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|This T-rex is gorgeous, solid, sturdy, and became my 3-year old boy's favorite toy the day it arrived.  Highly recommend.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is seriously a great app!! You won't regret getting it!! This app will bring you closer to god! It is really easy to use and it has many diffrent religion types to help you read the right bible!! This is a mussssttttt HAVVVEEEE!!!!
B002C6A6FY|5.0|This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.<br /><br />One of my favorites, regardless of my preference for Lauren Bacall, Ingrid does an amazing job! Obv, Humphrey Bogard is the shit.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|I can't believe I'd never heard of this book until last year! It is now on my list of top 5 books. It's like \\"Animal Farm\\" in that it seems like a children's story on the surface, but goes so much deeper. This will be a book I read again and again.
1449437524|5.0|This book is full of laughs and I think all dog lovers can relate to most of these circumstances.  Great as a gift!
B00296A4F4|2.0|ech, enjoyed this for a while, the dvd is of standard quality but the show is starting to make my soul hurt. It was purchased for research purposes surrounding the concept of minority representation within network television in a mixed cast.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books are as good as everyone says!  I've just started reading them, and I'm thoroughly enjoying them!!!  I don't know how they'll make this into a movie!
B003T0G9Y4|5.0|Very Very Funny, Light hearted such an enjoyable read.I read this book on holidays Now reading all in the series.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Great quality dvd, one of the best films of all time. JUST LOVELY!  why wouldn't you buy this? I sure did!
B000002OOY|5.0|very relaxing music. great to listen to when camping or just kicking back. i ues to have this when the movie first came out the was stoling glad to have it back again
B0083P1QUM|1.0|I have read all of Cornwell's novels. The last few weren't great, and this one was terrible. The story did not flow. It felt fragmented. I'm very disappointed in this one :(
B0051SDM5Q|5.0|This book gives great insight on working with people.  Ultimately it provides simple but applicable knowledge to negotiations.  I would recommend this book to anyone that was in a managerial role.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Really couldn't stand Donna too much in the Christmas episode last season but you fall in love with her for sure when she becomes a full time companion in this season.  They're chemistry (completely platonic of course) is great and I am enjoying re-watching this season while I wait for the 50th anniversary episode!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|My wifw and I watched this on our new led TV.  We had seen the reviews and thought it may be a good movie.  That being said we streamed it from amazon prime and we were a captive audience throughout the movie.  If you like an inocent teen drama that the whole family can watch this is a movie for you and yours.  A good pick on prime
B00B7Y0206|2.0|You have a good app except I cannot search for or watch videos 95% of the time.  I have to power off repeatedly to for any hopes to view anything.  Please fix for better rating!!!
B00BIPORC8|5.0|excellent writing, interesting relationships, unpredictable development. Do you seriously what me to write a whole review for the show that I just like?
B0094BB4TW|3.0|My wife likes to use face book to keep up with her family and friends I cancled my account becaus the government knows too much about me allready and social media just collects information about you your likes and dislikes for anybody to see
0887081770|5.0|This is a very sweet children's book - in paperback format -  and it is especially wonderful if your grandchildren call their grandfather &#34;Papa!&#34;
B00D3V97DO|3.0|I don't know what it is, but this is an OK Sabbath record. I just don't have the appetite for this gloomy stuff that I used to. Frankly, I miss Ronnie James Dio. That version of the band is more to my liking,
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Once I finished Ender's Game, I began reading the rest of the series, and I can say now that I've become fully addicted.  They're great, but once you get started, be prepared to be in the Ender universe for some time following.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Have loved this movie since seeing it in the theater years ago!  Beautiful animation and wonderful, memorable songs.  We actually purchased this DVD as a replacement for our original VHS.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Finally!  A literate, well scripted show, with engaging, interesting, well acted characters.  We need more of this type quality programming.
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|awesome!  this movie is by far disneys funniest movie ever.rent the crap out of it on a daily basis jeeeesh
B0061QD88S|5.0|Love this Disney story and have actually had this movie for some time.  We love this story so much that we bought this copy as a replacement to our original release VHS.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Loads of fun. Takes a bit of time to build your base up but it's worth it. Single and multiplayer components are fun. Good graphics are good. Sound is good.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|AWESOME praise & worship CD with Darlene Zschech! All her works are great, but this one blows them away! Amazing!
B00C90T4QK|5.0|What a WONDERFUL song!!  Great pick-me-up tune with the best lyrics!  Always a great way to begin and end my day!
B005544TRQ|4.0|Nice premise, imaginative.  Nice clothes with interesting characters in them.  Being a family man this is something you can watch without being too embarrassed.
B000HZGNEU|5.0|There's no doubt that Star Trek is the greatest sci fi movies or series. Been hooked from the beginning. I have the original series & have seen all.
034580404X|5.0|I was so up set when the story ended. I was a big fan of Christian. He was so wounded, but he was so willing to love. I would keep him in a moment. Thank you for this set. My whole family of woman have read it and feel the same.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|You couldn't find two men more different in age, race, wealth and beliefs, yet they both suffer from an inability to feel.  The abuse of public welfare crosses their paths, and sets them both on a journey of discovery, that teaches us to feel as well.  If you can only see one film this year, this is the one.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|You can play this game anywhere and it requires almost no skill. Very fun. Easy to pull out in the waiting room or anywhere and play a level or two. Love to play this anytime I have some free time. Would recommend to anyone of all ages.
0425263908|5.0|I saw a lot of the same story line as what I read in 50 shades of grey. hope to see some other avenues explored in the future. But a good read any way.
B006CHML4I|5.0|The watch itself is great, wonderful quality, awesome looks. The only issue I had was that it was very small, think of a boy's watch, thats how big it is. Other than the size, it would have been a great watch to add to my collection.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day has done it again! Another great book that I couldn't put down. Left me wanting more and more.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So this game is totally frustrating but it makes you think.  I love playing it at  work  I'm my kindle!! Fuunnnnnnn
B005DD7H50|2.0|Either I was in a trance, warped to some other plane, or the movie actually has big bad holes and the suspension of disbelief didn't work for me this time.<br />Especially the end... what? How did he manage to cut the side effects? If I fell asleep and didn't see the explanation, I apologize.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|such a great movie! If your looking for a happy cry watch it! I loved how it was a true story and they actually showed the real people at the end of the movie!
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|This book is equally as good as his two previous books.  I love his style of writing,he tells  stories which give an insight into the lives and struggles of the Afghan people.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I knew it got bad reviews but I love sci-fi  and Tom Hanks but just couldn't get through this movie.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|I'm not sure why the kindle fire didn't come with a calculator to begin with but this app is free and very usefull. I have not had any problems with it but I don't use it all the time. It does help when your doing simple math that you can't do in your head but I have not tried any thing harder
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game actually makes you feel like you are really taking care of a real horse. If you live in a city and love to ride horses this game is great practice to take care of a horse. Personally, I love this game. Because I live in a city, and love to ride horses when I can get the chance.
1439152799|5.0|If you love mysteries and castles, you will love this book. Kate Morton is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. I love her writing style and the Gothic mysteries she creates. These books have taken me back to my Nancy Drew days. Some mystery novels can be very predictable, but this was the opposite. It surprised me at every turn, and just when I thought I had it figured out, I didn't. Nothing was ever what it seemed. This made the book very enjoyable.<br /><br />The characters in this story are very eccentric. Edie was the most normal relatable character. I felt like she was someone I could have been friends with. Her passion is books. That passion mixed with a little family history takes her on a wild journey that leads her to the Blythe sisters. As she uncovers the sisters' story and her mother's history, she discovers deeply buried secrets that will shock you. The twins are very interesting. They were truly like two halves of a whole. Although twins, they shared opposite character traits. Juniper was mentally ill and was never given proper treatment because her sisters would not let her leave the castle. They didn't want her taken away from them. They also suffered the consequences...<br /><br />The story is captivating from the first page. I couldn't get enough of the story and couldn't put the book down. I highly recommend The Distant Hours and give it five stars.
B0091REZMW|1.0|It's a mystery to me why amazon would have this app, it took me 3 tries to get it to download on my kindle fire and then when  I did it wouldn't work so I had to reload it again. Then it kept telling me that I didn't have enough memory to run it so I deleted some of my other apps and it still would not work. Finally got it up and running an half way through it quite again.<br />So save your time and money and dont bother with this app
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Read the books too!!! The series is a mirror of the literature and I'd give both 10Stars if I could..!
B008N1V11U|5.0|Best app ever and I'm a big comic book fan. Would like to see more apps like this it was fun period.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|Movie was just ok, I was expecting more due to good rating on rotten tomateos. It's an average horor movie, but falls shorts of good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|$6.99 is expensive, but the full version is $27. Updates are coming fast and soon it will be as fun as the computer version. Buckets have already came!
1439153663|5.0|Just a great read.  There is everything in it to make it a great story.  I would read it again, and have recommended it to friends.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Good mind relaxing game to wind down in the evenings. The game has lots of color and beautiful pictures and different levels of puzzels to work, from 40+ pieces to over 200.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a nice way to enjoy an hour of game play. Looking forward to new levels in the future.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Good 70's folk/rock music. Be sure to see the documentary &#34;Searching for Sugarman&#34; which explains a lot about Rodriguez and his music.
1455869929|5.0|Great Novel. A little emotionally heavy at some parts, but a great book. The Audio was very good, and the Author's note read by John Green added a great touch.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|My aunt loves this show and suggested I watch it.  I started with season 1 and am watching my way up to the current season.  I am so gland my aunt suggested it.  This is a great series.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Can you escape is a great game. If you are thinking about getting it stop thinking and get this app.
B0042X9L6A|4.0|Does it all. If you are shopping, you already know why you need it. Don't cheap out like I did. Get this one first.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time....and this first one of the series is the best!  My granddaughter (who is 3) will call out in an English accent....&#34;oh Grammy, 'Arry Potter is on!&#34;  I love it!
B000W7JWUA|4.0|This game was on sale so I bought another copy as a backup.  So far I've purchased no less than six copies which I have given as gifts to friends and family who love to play this game as much as i do.<br /><br />It's very addictive until your vindictive &#34;friends&#34; keep placing the bandit on your resources!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This is one of the BEST books i have ever read. I very much enjoyed this book. Hannah really relates to me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|my friend told me and showed me minecraft and I wad like in my head &quot; it is pixalated it will not be a good game but I was dead wrong. Minecraft is awesome!!
1589795474|4.0|Sometimes it seemed as though there was a bit of generalization thrown in with the facts; however this was an eye opener
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The characters were all well developed and the story very much held your interest.  You could emnpathise with each character.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|After a first few posts, the older posts turn to words that cannot open up especially if it's a picture or a video. It's very annoying and a terrible app so I'm forced to use my iPhone to check my Facebook. Please fix this app! It's terrible.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Again, I just love action movies! Also, enjoy Samuel Jackson's movies. I had seen about the last 5 min or so on TV several yrs ago, but never got to see the whole movie until I rented Red.
030759565X|5.0|Of all the 70 or so cookbooks we've cycled through over the years, this one has gained a dominant place on our shelf. We refer to it several times a week. The recipes are wonderful, illustrated by beautiful photos. And the author's comments are funny and enlightening. The cookbook contains many low-meat recipes for people who are trying to cut back on meat consumption, though it's by no means vegetarian. The kale salad recipe alone is worth the price of the cookbook. We've been making it at least once a week. The author also writes a blog that we enjoy reading.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|I love this comedy it's very funny. My favorite characters are Sheldon, Penny, Leonard and Amy. I love the way the characters interact with each other.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|The author of this book takes you on such an intimate journey with energy that you absolutely must go out and buy this book.  By the time I got to the third excercise, I was so enamoured with the process that I knew I had stumbled on something great.  If you are interested in raising your vibration and being tuned into miracles that happen all around us every day, get this book and read until you find a part that makes your heart sing.  Best to you on your journeys as mine has been amazing.
B00CISAPJS|4.0|\\"Jack the Giant Slayer\\" is a fun, little fantasy tale with a surprisingly dynamic cast including Ewan McGregor as the dashing captain of the King's guard, Nicholas Hoult (\\"Warm Bodies\\") as a lovable head-in-the-clouds hero named Jack, the very lovely Eleanor Tomlinson as Princess Isabelle, Stanley Tucci as the villainous Lord Roderick and Bill Nighy (\\"Underworld\\") doing the voice-acting for the giant general.<br /><br />Ultimately the story and performances themselves aren't particularly inspiring (writers didn't give them much to work with) while the musical score is pretty standard (hate to say generic), the FX are nothing particularly spectacular but they're respectable and I actually did end up liking the giants; also lots of lavish costumes and cool vistas, some edge-of-your-seat action sequences and a hero & heroine with decent chemistry, all kept me watching when I came really close to turning it off during the first 5 minutes.  I'm sure this film would've benefitted from a more powerful villain, less adolescent grossness and maybe a bit more magic but I think it would make a nice springboard to a sequel (there's some good material here) as long as it added more complexity and scope.<br /><br />Again, it's fairly entertaining with a good rewatchability factor (which is why I bought it after renting in HD no less), much better than a similar fairy-tale retake (i.e. \\"Snow White & the Huntsman\\") and I also think it's worth mentioning that this film is surprisingly clean given there's very little profanity, lewdness or gratuitous violence as the \\"slaying\\" Jack does is more metaphorical than literal.  :o)
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I really enjoyed this show. This season was my first exposure to Dr. Who, and I have to admit I was surprised at how good it was. It is both funny and sad and has a great deal of depth of character. It is so much more than just a &#34;cult&#34; show. I think it will be interesting to see how the new &#34;Doctor&#34; does next season.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|If you track what the author has done since writing this book, you will see that he invented the whole thing about his so-called out of the body experience. He did it to makes lots of money, and it worked. He's nothing but a huckster.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|I loved Cranford, and I loved Return to Cranford.  this period piece is set in the 1700 hundreds in a remote village called Cranford.  All the characters have very good parts and roles in their social circle.  You can't wait to the next episode, which is of course why I binge-watched the series...and then bought it.  I love Judi Dench, but there are no weak characters in this series.  And, it's family friendly.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Reminds me an old fashioned lawyer/detective story in a modern day setting. Good acting with witty words in the script
1400069807|5.0|I am fortunate to be wheat-intolerant, so I'm not even tempted to eat most of the junk sold in the grocery stores any more (although there's plenty of GF junk out there now), and I switched to clean eating about 6 months ago. Even so, how the processed food industry purposefully sets out to lure us in and hook us any way they can on food they know is terrible. The heads of those companies don't even eat their own products because they know how detrimental they are to health. Now I look down those aisles and see the suits masterminding how they will get kids hooked on junk for life. Some of those suits call their customers \\"users!\\" As in addicted, as if their customers were strung-out druggies instead of moms and dads and kids.<br /><br />I wish I could get everyone who does the grocery shopping for their families, everyone who stops in to buy a snack or soda at a convenience store, and everyone who sends their kids to school with a sack lunch or the gut-bombs called Lunchables to read this book.<br /><br />Read it. It's an eye-opener.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|my girls each had a device playing this app yesterday and they just giggled for a half hour.<br />great for kids.  I played to unlock some games for them and was pleasantly surprised.  couldn't unlock them on the first try.  some of the games I had trouble with moving the object but overall great games for free.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I love a book that develops like a Polaroid picture. As you watch, things gradually float to the surface, and the picture becomes complete.  It's even better when you have an idea what the picture is going to be, and it turns out to be more than you imagined.This is one of those books.
B00723NWJE|4.0|I have always like Norah Jones - she just has that smooth voice. It would be great to have a greatest hits collection soon!
B00D8WMASM|5.0|J. Cole has truly made a classic album. Born Sinner will definitely go platinum or gold! I can't stop listening to it!
B000HBK3MM|4.0|This is an excellent CD and the sound of the music and Corinne's voice is just so amazing. If you like easy listening music that is also sensual then get this.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|I'm not of the rap music demographic but I do have a young adult son who introduced me to Kanye West back in 2010 with My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. I listened to that CD every day for over six months straight. Could not stop listening. Still can't.  Haven't looked back. Now with Yeezus, Kanye West has just shown us that he is unstoppable. Here is a undeniably brilliant artist taking his music to the next level. Sort of reminds me of the evolution of Picasso and Cubism.  Other people I have talked to agree. Not sure why so few rating stars on Amazon, but I don't think it accurately represents how a lot of people are responding to this CD.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I found the good wife very addictive. I watch several episodes at a time. It considers enough current topics and moral dilemmas intersected with politics,parenting, infidelity, criminal and corporate law to keep it interesting.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|This is an enjoyable drama. Easy to get drawn into the story line and can't watch the next one. When is season three comming out
B005DD7H50|5.0|This is a great movie - it kept me in suspense.  I saw part of it on television, and enjoyed it so much, I rented it to see the beginning.  It is the kind of movie you can watch over and over again, getting more out of it each time.  Highly recommend this.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|This game has beautiful graphics, but gets boring pretty fast; unless you are willing to pay. There aren't many objectives. Most of the game is  just tapping on objects to collect what they produce- coins or algi.
B002KJX4IE|5.0|Great Music! Actually had my wife dancing to the beat. This is a sort of family movie, probably PG-13. Good acting and storyline.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|It;s an okay program. It downloads what its suppose to, but trying to get it to play elsewhere is the issue.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|It's really not fair of spending 5 hard earned pearls on 350 game dollars. I want my pearls back.....I can make the money harvesting my own things.......Not fair. Give me something worth pearls.
B007N5YIUS|2.0|I like the game in every other then the fact that there are videos EVERY TIME YOU RESET THE LEVEL OR FINISH IT and there are banners also some are so big I can't even play the game! Other then that I like the game.
B003V4AK8E|1.0|As previously mentioned, the deadzones are enormous. And honestly, after using the wired one, i expected this to be about the same, but it wasn't anywhere close. Both the sticks are useless and I actually don't like the grip thing. As others have mentioned, it actually is uncomfortable in your hands and feels like its cutting them.
B0010358CG|5.0|its appleseed second film ^.^ i love the art style and i found the movie finally on online cuase best buy never has anything when i go to there stores
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|worth watching for sure!  Our headline actors score again!  Graphics are great and the concept is progressive.....nice! Cheers to ole' Tom again!
B003Y74AZ2|1.0|It doesnt fit proper to my iphone , easily comes off..<br />It is not worth the buck spent...Dont buy it..
B00457X7XQ|5.0|If you like IT novels, this one is a very good one to read.  I recommend this book to you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's so addictive I especially love that you can go all around the world and use the different tracks and i love the characters and the outfits and the hover boards and the challenges and boosts there amazing
B007ZXK08C|5.0|It was full of suspense and the characters were intriguing with everyday weaknesses, strengths and flaws that we all have, but with offbeat personality issues that kept you guessing.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Very fun love the game in my top 5 list it comes in at number 3 love free games  my brother always  is trying to steal my kindle to play this game
B002GYI9C4|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  There's a simplicity to his writing that is refreshing, yet the storyline is unique and full of surprises.  I love the nobility of the characters.
0767836324|5.0|This is an oldy so I wasn't sure if my daughter was going to like it. But this has become her favorite movie by far! We can watch it as a family and we ALL enjoyed it! I love bring back the old movies!
B00BQXWH2O|4.0|I love his podcast and a lot of his songs, but there were enough songs that were just ok that for $16 I'd just buy what you like. But there are some seriously good songs.
B00915G6YE|4.0|Everyone's favorite serial killer's live continues to become more complicated as his secrets become known to more people. This season sees characters challenged in ways live never before, the lines between right and wrong become more and more blurred. This season will satisfy you and leave you wanting more. With the eight and final season fast approaching, the only thing to as is what can happen next as the writer's have continued to prove is anything.
B005544V6A|4.0|I love Suits so much that I binge-watched the entire first season in three days. The relationship between Harvey and Mike makes this show fantastic, but the secondary characters are also just as compelling and well-rounded. I would recommend Suits to everyone!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|So happy I had the chance to read this book! Landay's style lends itself to a casual readability.... that is until you get to roughly the last 10% of the book which is so twisted and emotional that those few pages alone make this book a worthwhile bestseller!  I'm definitely planning on reading other books by him.... hopefully they're just as clever and unpredictable!
B004BSFC6Y|3.0|Maybe it's just my twins but these didn't seem to help them \\"find their feet\\". I used only a few times. Wasted the money but maybe it works for others??!
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|This s a better flying game than others.  The controls are sluggish and I find it difficult to pull a tight turn.  The enemy is always behind you and it takes time to get around to firing position.  The jets with missiles allow a bit easier success than the guns.  I would like unlimited time during a mission or at least a few more minutes but the graphics are great.  I play a few missions every day.  Enjoyable.
B006VJMZXY|4.0|Thouroughly enjoyed the story about this aspect of the era. Looking forward to reading 'The White Princess' next.<br />Must read!
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Classic, compelling and gritty.  For some reason, the narration totally works and the story arc from riches to rags is beautiful.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it a great game it works your brain to find clues. and go to the next floor its easy. you wil enjoy it.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|I did not expect this game to be challenging. As the levels go forward it gets challenging. Makes you think about your next moves. I found it easier to work the puzzles on the kindle but it is still worth it to get on the iphone. I would liked to been able to have additional hints instead of just 1. Be aware that you have to pay for more hints after 1.
B00A7W29BE|3.0|Genius scan is not a bad app, but the \\"enhancement\\" algorithms leave much to be desired.<br /><br />Using the same images (taken with the phone's camera first so that the images to be processed were identical) I compared the cropping and enhancement algorithms of both apps side by side. They both are able to auto-detect what needs to be cropped pretty well, but when it comes to enhancing the image to make the text stand out clearly, MDScan is definitely the winner.<br /><br />On every image tested Genius Scan made the resulting \\"scan\\" somewhat fuzzy almost as if the resolution was decreased during processing. On the other hand MDScan was able to enhance the pictures without sacrificing detail and the text remained clear and sharp.<br /><br />I bought MDScan when it went on sale on the play store a day or two before Genius Scan became the free app of the day. At first I was kicking myself for buying MDScan since I was able to get Genius Scan for free, but after testing both I am happy I purchased MDScan when it was on sale as it worked much better with all my test documents.<br /><br />Mobile Doc Scanner (MDScan) is by STOIK Soft and is not available yet on the Amazon App Store.  Unfortunately, at its full price ($5), it is quite a bit more expensive than Genius Scan.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|The characters are great. The story lines are convincing and engaging. I get sucked in to every episode. Love it!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great puzzles but wish there were more levels! But it's free so may as well play the few that are there.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Based on the English fable of Jack and the Beanstalk.  Pretty funny and engaging.  The giants are hideous.  Fun movie.
B0001I561E|3.0|The reason I say it is ok is because for some reason on my DVD/TV combo in the kitchen, CD one plays all the coming attractions, but stops and will not play the actual movie. It plays in its entirety on my combo in my bedroom. I bought this so my grandkids could watch it in the kitchen.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is a lot like 100 floors...which i have missed lately. This arrived just when i was getting bored.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Very gritty.  Characters are very &#34;deep&#34; which is surprising for a first season.  Makes you wonder if bike gangs are really this badass...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun it is like your really taking care of a real horse it is the finest horse game I've. played yet
B004J4WNL2|5.0|A brilliant description and analysis of today's creative and financial successes of our time.....through the lens of personality and communication/interaction styles.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|I was expecting bad, and hopefully bad in a good sort of way, but this was just sad. There's no joy in this, no development of any kind. Nothing really matters in this movie - not worth the time.
B003TTCURU|5.0|Its so great to be able to watch from Season 1-Season 9 with my Amazon Prime Account. Great summer watching!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Nice style and fun to play.Easy on the eye and interesting as to moves for winning --  not difficult but requires attention.
1451668945|5.0|I love Mary Higgins Clark, and this is definitely one of her best books. Loved it. Read it in about 4 hours, haha.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This goofy game makes me smile. My kids love it too. Makes me wonder what is going on in my fridge when the door is shut.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|Definitely the best of the franchise. Due to the story elements, this film operates on a different level than the first two, but it all works out. Ultimatum finds Bourne still suffering from his wounds that were inflicted at the end of Supremacy, desperate to get out of Moscow. He is determined to put an end to the agency's search for him. Within the agency, we meet Noah Vosen, the new head of the still ongoing search for Bourne. He reports directly to the CIA director, Ezra Kramer. Vosen proves to be nowhere near Bourne's capabilities, so he calls in Pamela Landy, introduced in Supremacy, to help him out. Much like she did with Brian Cox's character Abbott in Supremacy, she begins to grow suspicious of why the agency really wants Bourne and if he might actually be innocent. To further complicate things, there is a reporter in London who has some very interesting information on Bourne's past, but also has a very mysterious source that might be directly involved with the whole thing. And, of course, Bourne has begun having more visions. Like before, they are just brief flashes of scenes from his his past, along with voices and faces he doesn't recognize. In his quest to figure all this out, Bourne travels from Moscow, to Naples, to Madrid, to Tangiers, and finally, to New York City. This is where the final scene from Supremacy comes into play. It is seamlessly integrated into Ultimatum's storyline. Bourne meets up with Nicky Parsons, a former agency employee that is now willing to help him. She sees something in Bourne, much like what Marie saw in him. She begins to realize that he might very well be innocent, and that the agency is trying to eliminate an innocent man. This relationship between them is not at all romantic, but is very important. Bourne sees Nicky as someone that he can just use at first, but later, he realizes that she genuinely wants to help. Therefore, he has to protect her just because she didn't tell on him. Nicky sees Bourne as a highly torturedand emotionally conflicted person. I think that she has also had enough of the agency, and wants to do whatever she can. All throughout the film, we are treated to spectacular chases, fights, and some terrific acting by the entire cast. All of which has become expected from these films, and never gets old. Due to the agency's continued search and the inclusion of the reporter/source subplot, a lot of the film is spent away from Bourne. But this actually works in Bourne/Damon's favor, because literally everything that is happening is always focused on Bourne and what he is doing. Each member of the cast realizes and fully understands their role, and how their character ties in with the script. It is a great film because it ratchets up the intensity and suspense from the first two, without being overbearing or too simplistic.
B005WYFLNU|3.0|this sticker book looks great. my child loved it but the stickers are hard to put back in their correct spot for reuse.
B0091W7MP4|5.0|I enjoyed the emotional interplay of these excellent actors. It was a gripping plot with plenty of surprises. Sigourney Weaver is such a versatile actress.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|One of the best shows ever made with some of the best actors. I been a fan of the walking dead for 2 years now and i gotta say i love it. I hope this turns out to be one of toughs long lasting shows kinda like the Mythbusters or what not. The disk were in good shape.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|I love this game! It's got such interesting obstacles and innovative rewards. I find it both amusing and addictive to play.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I like ths speed of this book. It doesn't over do character detail lets you develop your vision as you go! Great read and worth a try!
B0058SNI9O|4.0|Not a problem with the product -- just size selection.  (My wife insisted on a 6.)  Re-ordered in a smaller size (5).  Purchased for my 88-year old mother-in-law and she really likes it.  The front is roomier than other sandal models with space more akin to  a \\"standard\\" Croc which helped with her fit.  Another model -- I forget the name -- had a decorative metallic tab on the top that prevented stretch when putting them on.  This model, without the tab, stretches for better comfort.  They're dressier than a standard Croc, protect her toes and the low profile heel is safe for her to walk in. She is difficult to fit and please, so finding something that satisfied them both was a big plus!
B00CL50LEC|4.0|It was a really cute, saucy twist on a 'forbidden romance'. My only true beef with this movie is the very end. I won't give away any spoilers, but really? Watch the movie, examine the ending, and share my beef. All I'll say is that they resolve everything rather quickly.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Never knew how Star Trek became so popular until taking trip back in time. Even though the effects are a bit awful, it was the 60's! The stories are great! No wonder the show was a hit!
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|This movie was alright... wait, no it wasn't. There was a scene where the &#34;boogie man&#34; is on the main characters computer screen. While the man has his head turned, the image of the boogie man turns to stare at him... and it was ridiculous. It is not that incredible for images to move on a computer screen, at least to those of us under the age of 70. And I love how the son's night terrors are completely overlooked and that the girls creepy drawing, which she drew all over the house, are apparently invisible to the parents. &#34;Oh no honey, this house is perfectly safe&#34; he says as his daughter draws creepy dead people hanging from trees in the background. &#34;Quit farting around, honey!&#34;<br />But the number one reason I gave this movie two stars is because of the TEN scenes where the father is walking around his house in the dark and running into things. Ever think you might be tripping over furniture and not the spawn of Satan? I know it's a long shot, but lets think this through.
B00BRPH4EC|5.0|Best him album since dark light a return to true him roots \m/ Finnish metal at its best especially title track
B001O37WTY|5.0|This felt like one of those &#34;before they were famous&#34; movies, but it turned out to be so much more. I wouldn't say it was good, but I would say that it is an experience you don't want to miss out on.
B008MM9630|3.0|Fun game but kinda slow, can't complete task fast enough because of the farming length of some quests. Like I'm level nine and I have a task that im progressed with one part but need to level up to 25 and 34 to finish the rest of the task. So rated it a three.
B00CX1TSSO|5.0|I want to hate this movie so bad. It is the classic movie about an underprivileged boy who falls in love with an over-privileged girl. There is really nothing original about it. Well, I guess there are giants, or whatever.<br />My beef with this movie is that it was so well executed that I have nothing bad to say about it. I purchased it hoping for a badly done sci-fi-esque B-movie, and got a well-done fantasy romance flick.<br />Also, it is very family oriented. Damn them.
B001GMH8T2|5.0|I have watched this movie on TV several times so decided to buy it so that i can watch it any time i want to without commercials. GREAT MOVIE!
B000I62JAK|5.0|&#34;Words can only hurt you if you try to read them. Don't play their game!&#34; and<br />&#34;Maybe there's more to life than being really, really, really ridiculously good looking?&#34;<br />Best movie ever. I couldn't turn left for a week after watching it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I wasn't really wanting to try this game bit my sister talked me in to trying and now it's hard to put it down. The higher the level, the more you want to get the other puzzle pieces. Great game.
B004SD2Z5S|5.0|This book is wonderful, and easy to get into (after getting through the first fifteen pages). The cover is fantastic. My only problem with the book is that the cover made me look so smart and sophisticated while reading that my sister stole it from me, and you can never confront a pregnant woman.
B002XXPNXG|4.0|I wanted to see this movie since Before Midnight got such good reviews.  I first watched Before Sunrise and enjoyed both movies.
B006TKP2B2|1.0|Calling this book 'The Windup Girl' is like calling World War I 'The Lusitania'. There's four protagonists, and the Windup Girl barely counts as one, being mostly a curiosity, a woman utterly deprived of agency, and a plot contrivance and a motivation for maybe one and a half of the other protagonists. The world is joyless, and I could hardly bring myself to care about any of the protagonists, except for the titular Windup Girl herself, who we are conditioned to like because of her relentless victimization. If you want to read one of the few books that is more misogynistic than Game of Thrones, this is it. Otherwise, give it a pass.
B00821OX98|4.0|Often series take a while to gel, so far this one seemed to hit the ground on fairly solid footing. Actors seemed to have good chemistry right out of the gate.
B001FVV2X2|3.0|Not as good as JJ's other work, but the season picks up momentum eventually. Worth it for free when you have amazon prime.
0451232852|3.0|You need to pack books more carefully, not just throw them into a box.  The pages of this book were dented because they were caught on the edge of the box.  Please shrink wrap paperbacks in future.<br />Haven't read the book yet, am still straightening out the pages.<br />agw
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I have been using this mouse for a week now and I found it extremely comfortable.<br />My hand is big and I use claw grip, the mouse suit like a glove. Very responsible. The drivers will not amaze anyone, but get the job done. Additionally, the extra weights (all of them) gave the mouse a perfect weight for my taste.<br /><br />The only cons is that the button below the wheel, the macro play button, is quite noisy. Not a big deal.<br /><br />Amazing quality for the price.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book is a great story as were his previous books.  A family torn apart by circumstances of poverty, great characters and ending.
B00821OX98|5.0|I wasn't sure how much I would like this show since I don't care for alien shows with robots (like district 9- hated it) BUT after I watched a show or 2 I was hooked. The story really reels you in.  It's a good pick.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Jewel Legends is probably the best match-3 game I have found for the kindle fire.  The graphics are very nice and the animations are fun.  The game is fun yet challenging.
B003FFEX8C|1.0|If you enjoy terrible movies, then this is a 5 star film. It was an amazing train wreck to watch. I'm not sure how so many back to back to back poor decisions where able to be be executed. This film is a true hollywood puzzle.<br /><br />One word: Catnip.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|I like the game but I cannot tolerate the sound of the driver's neck breaking when he flips the car. That is just nasty.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|My grown kids and I have watched this movie so many times.  We never get tired of it.  Great acting and a history lesson to boot.  Not totally following the book.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Addictive to build and be rewarded. Other than that, there is no added value to watching the city grow (other than seeing it grow) that would warrant 5 stars. In better games of this style, there's fun watching the population enjoy it. I also find the energy limitations a bit annoying. I see some benefits to it as well ... like forcing you to put down the game to enjoy other things. :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|Out right amazing the best action packed novel in history. A lot of twists and turns great characters and descriptions like you were a really there
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|I play a lot of Euro style boardgames, but never bothered with &#34;hey that's my fish&#34; as I thought it was just a kids game. I thought I'd try this out (as there is a limited amount of boardgames on Android, though its improving) and its a very easy to play game. The A.I. on it seemed quite competent and graphically its implemented very well. It's made me appreciate the actual boardgame version, so I may seek out to play that.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I loved this movie! The humor, the gore, which was totally over the top! I love Tarantino movies, and this is a perfect addition!
B003XMUFGQ|5.0|it is brand new, with good price, i love it. i got it on time. willing to purchase more products with this dealer.
B004G600A4|5.0|Tangled is the latest and best Disney movie so far!<br />It seems they finally found a way to tap into the all-ages appeal Shrek from Dreamworks has maintained so effortlessly.<br />Rapunzel is a lovely, Prince charming entertaining, good plot, very funny bits- this is a must for a good DVD Collection!
0062255657|4.0|I love Neil Gaiman... Since he writes for children and adults, I want to place this one between Coraline and The Graveyard Book. It's not as simple as Coraline and not as complex as The Graveyard Book, but it's clearly a children's tale.<br /><br />As always, Gaiman's descriptions are enchanting and atmospheric. He begins with a trip to his childhood as he visits his childhood home. Echoes of James Joyce as he trips down the lane remembering the irrational impressions of a child. He ends at the pond which his young friend insisted is an Ocean. As something of a memoir turns into a fantasy tale, the pond turns out to be an ocean and the world he enters as he crosses the lawn is enchanted.<br /><br />This is an adventure with heroics, life lessons and creepy otherworldly elements that make Gaiman magical. Again, I heard Neverwhere, Coraline and The Graveyard Book, though Coraline is younger, Neverwhere is way more complex and The Graveyard Book is just more magical. This story has the single line story line that is more similar to Coraline though it is more of a novel oriented toward the audience of The Graveyard Book... a worthy addition to the shelf of the teen oriented literature of Neil Gaiman while still completely satisfactory to adults who still indulge in fantasy.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Mulan is a refreshing change from the regular disney princesses- she's real, fun and complicated.<br />Big step up from the one dimensional Aurora and Snow White.<br />Not sure Eddie Murphy was the best choice to be the voice of Mushi as his voice is really out of place... But he is funny as usual and the rest of the movie makes up for that awkward combo.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|Trying to find new decently priced Gamecube controllers is starting to become difficult. I recently had to replace the controllers I've been using since the Gamecube's launch in 2001, they've lasted me 12 years with heavy use, and with a similar product from Nintendo I expect a long lasting product once again.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game but after my first time playing it i can't figure out how to get back to it.  But everyone who's reading this get this game.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Thoughtfully conceived and well written. It was hard to put down. The oral history approach put an interesting spin on an otherwise saturated genre.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My granddaughter loves it. I have rented it twice. Maybe end up having to buy it for her! Thats ok.
B000HT386M|5.0|Love this movie. Every guy should watch it. One of my favorites. Adam Sandler always plays a good part. Just a fun movie to watch and laugh with all the while conveying an important message.
1936608898|5.0|AWESOME book.  Have been paleo for a year, and am pretty well-versed in the info backing up the diet/lifestyle. That said, having heard such positive reviews, I checked out ISWF from my library a week ago.  Finished it in a few days, but wish it kept going for so much more! Not only is it a super well-researched and easy to comprehend, but its a BLAST to read--I brought it with me everywhere and would look forward to catching 5 mins here or there to tuck my nose back into it.  Recommending it to just about everyone I know (and now, you folks!).<br /><br />I'm not even the type to make the effort to go leave reviews about things, but I just felt so compelled by this rockstar read!
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|I wish I could get this to run on my Laptop. It is really easy to use and fast. Windows 7 and 8 should adopt this one.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Didn't use it. I never had enough storage space on my kindle to be able to play without slowing down
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|I saw it on television and wanted to have a copy for my own use. I am very pleased with amazon fulfillment center and will purchase from them again in the future! Thanks<br />Always,<br />  LeAnne M Pruitt<br /><br />Now when I purchase movies I make certain they come with the Digital Copy or UlftaViolet for downloading so I can watch when the mood strikes me and when the only tv in the house is otherwise occupied
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Graphics are good. I wish it had a setting for lower graphics settings for my iPad 1. It runs pretty slow and freezes a lot on the iPad. I do have it running the same game on my phone though, so I can play with both devices. My droid 4 runs the game better, but it's still slow and jumpy at times.
