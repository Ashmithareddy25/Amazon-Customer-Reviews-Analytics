B003JTHXOK|4.0|Over the years I've read most of Nicholas Sparks' novels. Sometimes the movie's better. Sometimes the book. Yet he is remarkably prolific, popping out a novel or two every year since 1996.. His characters are simple, and the plots are well-paced. In [[ASIN:0446547603 Safe Haven]], Katie moves to a small, southern town determined to make it on her own. She finds a job waitressing and rents a dilapidated house in the sticks.<br /><br />Little by little, the author reveals information on Katie's background. She was married to a police offer. Isolated and abused for years. She once went by a different name. It doesn't take long before she catches the eye of a gray haired, thirty-something widower. He runs the local grocery store and seems to pay careful attention to her every need.<br /><br />Katie begins bonding with the widower and his two young children, slowly healing from her past as she relishes the small pleasures of safety and security. The love story is not as predominant in Safe Haven as it is in other Nicholas Sparks novels. More significant is the protagonist developing self-identity and confidence in her ability to persevere.<br /><br />Toward the end of the novel, Katie confronts some of the demons of her past, risking not only her own safety but those of her new friends in town. The sole flaw of the novel is that the two main characters have no real flaws. There is some overlap between this book and [[ASIN:0451186362 Rose Madder]]. Sparks has a core audience that will devour all his works regardless of quality--but this one stands the best chance of being read by non-fans well before the movie comes out in 2012.
B001E45XT4|3.0|I got this product on sale for $20 and I got what I paid for.  It was listed as somewhere in the $60 range originally though and if I had paid that much for it I would have been quite disappointed.  Pros:  Comfortable and a good fit, even for my giant head.  Mic works well.  Cons:  Very low to no bass output.  Overall sound quality was sub-par to the $10 headphones I had before.  Other thoughts:  The framing is all plastic, so a good 5 or 6 foot drop could defiantly break the headphones.  Overall, I would spend that $20 elsewhere.  I wish reviewers had been more informed before I purchased these.
0446573019|4.0|\\"Surely every man walks about like a shadow; Surely they busy themselves in vain; He heaps up riches, And does not know who will gather them.\\" -- Psalm 39:6 (NKJV)<br /><br />I would have liked this book a lot better if Lee Child hadn't already written the Jack Reacher novels. Instead, I kept having the feeling that I'd already read this book . . . and there are a number of surface similarities to Lee Child's latest Reacher novel, The Affair.<br /><br />I liked The Affair better than Zero Day, but Zero Day is a perfectly satisfying book. If you haven't read The Affair, you'll probably like Zero Day better than I did.<br /><br />I don't know enough about the military and military investigations to know how accurate the details are in Zero Day. But the details seemed credible to an ignorant person like me. If you are familiar with the details, their accuracy will probably affect your enjoyment of the book quite a bit.<br /><br />John Puller makes an interesting protagonist because Mr. Baldacci leaves so many mysteries virtually untouched in Puller's background. Obviously, future books are planned that will gradually reveal aspects of those mysteries which include a tricky family background and a seemingly irrational desire to avoid gaining military rank.<br /><br />Puller shows humanity that makes him more appealing than what might have been developed in someone who is a bit of a hard core cop-type.<br /><br />The mystery is decently complicated and not too transparently telegraphed.<br /><br />The book's main appeal, however, is in the pairing of the military investigator, Puller, with the single woman detective, Sam Cole. Their relationship carries the story forward in a way that the Reacher novels usually don't contain as effectively.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Love it! No time limit, so it only gets nerve-racking if your brain can't wrap itself around the concepts. Seems like it'd get boring since the goal is the same for each puzzle, but it's actually really stimulating because the challenges change and become more difficult as the game progresses. Loads of thoughtful fun! Kudos to the brains that can plot these things out- I wish someone would teach me how to think that way!
0393064476|4.0|Stephen Greenblatt<br />The Swerve:  How the World Became Modern<br /><br />Everyone who has ever taken a history course has heard that the Renaissance came about because of the rediscovery of ancient texts.  But did you ever wonder exactly how that happened?  Did an Italian housewife, rummaging through her pantry for Pizza ingredients, stumble upon a scroll and exclaim, \\"Mamma Mia! It's an original copy of the Nichomachean Ethics!\\"  Not exactly.  Stephen Greenblatt finally explains in simple laymen's terms how an unemployed Papal Secretary, whose dastardly and unfortunate boss, John XXIII, had been thrown in jail, and Poggio (the secretary) started wandering from monastery to monastery deliberately trying to find old manuscripts and dupe the suspicious abbots out of their treasures (or at least make copies).  Others did the same in the fifteenth century, but Poggio discovered Lucretius's De Rerum Natura, which Greenblatt describes as a \\"ticking time bomb.\\"<br /><br />Lucretius's book (\\"On the Nature of Things\\") works out in beautiful Latin verse the implications of Democritus and Epicurus.  It is essentially the \\"anti-Plato.\\"  Plato was for Renaissance Catholics the \\"ideal (no pun intended) Pagan.\\"  His sense of the transcendent importance of non-corporeal reality fits right in with Christian dogma--hence Renaissance Neo-Platonism.  The atomism of Democritus, Epicurus, and Lucretius flies in its face.  For them, nothing exists but matter, made up of countless atoms in constant motion, colliding, forming physical bodies, interacting, breaking down, and re-forming.  For Lucretius, this is enough to explain everything--a classic example of Occam's Razor.  No need for an omnipotent, omniscient god; a soul; an afterlife; and eternal bliss or damnation.  What you see is what you get; and that's plenty.<br /><br />One of the book's most humorous sections is a quoted passage from Bruno, riffing on the idea that \\"God's hand is on the fall of every sparrow.\\"  Bruno expounds in great detail on all the things God would have to attend to in the course of five minutes in Bruno's own backyard alone.  Of course, as we know, God has infinite capabilities so he can handle it.  Nevertheless, Bruno's exhaustive list shreds and ridicules the notion that God is hands-on in charge of everything that happens.<br /><br />The genius and the contribution of \\"The Swerve\\" is that it explains an abstract concept (rediscovery of classics) in vivid, concrete terms; it explains everything you ever wanted to know about making books; it gives a concise and close-up view of how the church hierarchy operated; it explicates Lucretius's philosophy; and it shows the powerful impact of just one single strand of thought (among many) that utterly transformed the Medieval world into the Modern.God would have to attend to in the course of five minutes in Bruno's own backyard alone.

B0058VW36U|1.0|Main screen loads, but completely freezes up when loading the actual game on Samsung Vitality (SCH-R720). PLEASE FIX ASAP!!!!!! I loved this game on my LG Optimus, and would really like to start playing is again!!!!!
B004WR125O|2.0|I ordered this in conjunction with the wireless adapter for my LG television, and attempted to hook it up last night. My television was able to stream netflix/vudu at full 1080p, however, this Onkyo wireless adapter wouldn't even connect because the signal apparently was too low, despite fully upgrading the firmware.<br /><br />I hooked this up to my desktop, and it registered it as having the Atheros AR9271 Chipset, so I found another Wireless USB with an external gain antenna. Granted, It isn't as tiny as this adapter, but I also got a short USB extension cable so I can route it behind my receiver.<br /><br />The exact model I purchased -IS- on Amazon ([[ASIN:B002WBX9C6 TP-Link TL-WN722N 150Mbps High Gain Wireless USB Adapter]]) for 1/3 the price of this and since it uses the same chipset (Please note, the model version is N150 High Gain) I am *assuming* it will work. I will reupdate this once I get confirmation of that, but overall, the UWF-1 adapter wouldn't even connect when the router was less than 30 feet away in another room.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br /><br />The alternative adapter I purchased worked flawlessly! I will upload a video once amazon's service works, but look in the comments below for a youtube video.<br /><br />***UPDATE AS OF May 25 2013***<br /><br />It seems that TP-Link has come out with new model numbers, which weren't on the linked page when I first made this review.. To be specific the model number I got was the N150 High Gain! I am glad this review saved a ton of people money for a product that wasn't good at all!
B005JZBP8W|4.0|I just purchased the Blu Ray release of \\"My Fair Lady.\\"  It is an excellent video.  Sound quality, color and detail are all top-notch.   However, the packaging is very disappointing. Quite \\"bargain basement.\\"   The case is the same as the cheapest BD's. As for the enclosed book, there was none.  There was no book, booklet, folder, leaflet, or even a Post-It that read \\"Good Movie!\\" written in crayon.  It is packaging worthy of the lowest price budget BD's.  But it is NOT packaging appropriate for the winner of several Oscars, including BEST PICTURE.  Examine the packaging for BD releases such as \\"Doctor Zhivago,\\" \\"North by Northwest,\\" or even \\"The Big Lebowski.\\"  If the folks in charge of packaging decide to dress Mt Fair Lady PROPERLY with some decent packaging, \\"My Fair Lady\\" will be a lot less like displaying a Ming vase atop a wooden produce crate.
B004Q7E0TA|4.0|Good book, listened to the audio version several times. Please be warned it can be a trigger. Sometimes these things can go either way.
B003M7BLOW|5.0|Got it for a build, this is my first review on Amazon so here goes:<br />Pros: Product was delivered within quickly without any defects on the packaging, installation was simple,(there is an instruction leaflet inside)fan install was tricky but that was my fault, powered up the PC.....worked fine, fan noise is not loud.<br />Performance wise...... I haven't maxed it, but I am not complaining.<br /><br />Cons: none so far...good buy
B0058VW36U|5.0|I initially took interest because of all of the stellar reviews, downloaded, then crash. I can't even get the first screen to come up.  Ok, updated the app. It's wonderfully addicting. Great job!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This evening I just received both the Kindle Fire and, in the same box, the Verso Prologue Cover (Tan)--and am really happy with both! As other reviewers have said, the cover looks beautiful, and it feels nice, like glove leather. I wanted a classy-looking, lightweight, trim cover and this fits the bill perfectly. It makes the Kindle look just like an antique book when it's sitting on the table.   The elastic IS a bit snug as other reviewers have said, but I think that's a GOOD thing. For comparison, I have an older M-Edge cover for a Kindle 3 that has looser elastics to hold in the top corners, and while it's ultraeasy to get the Kindle 3 in and out of the M-Edge cover, on the other hand I've occasionally found that the top outer corner elastic has essentially slipped off. So, I'm thinking a tighter elastic for the Kindle Fire is good: less sagging right at the get-go, and I don't really want any \\"give\\" when I'm say holding the Kindle Fire while using the elliptical (anything to make that darned elliptical more interesting, right?)! At first just looking at the Kindle Fire vs. the cover elastics I didn't think the Kindle Fire would fit, but I gave it a try and it actually did. There appears to be some anti-slip thin rubbery backing to the elastics, which given my occasional scares with the other cover, seems to be a good idea even though it makes it a little harder to adjust the position of the elastics.   The Kindle really feels like it's secure in there, yet there was enough room for me to run my index finger under the elastic to straighten it out a little after putting the Kindle in (this might be more difficult if you have bigger fingers). I did have to take the Kindle Fire out and put it back in again because I realized I'd put it in upside-down the first time, and it was easy enough. Also, I'm not planning to be taking it in and out of the cover very often.  The elastic is black, which is good as it doesn't detract from whatever I'm viewing on the screen. Thetwo ends of each of the elastic bands appear to go into slits in the microfiber fabric in the back of the cover. I tugged on them and couldn't tell how they were affixed to the back; anyway they seem to be pretty secure, will update the review if that changes.   There is a single lengthwise pocket inside the front cover that is made of the same black microfiber material as the inside cover; it appears to add good utility without bulk. The texture of the material is pleasant and suede-like.  As other reviewers have commented, initially the cover didn't quite fold flat over the Kindle Fire--at the far edge (away from the spine) the front cover was about 4 mm above the Kindle. I don't know that I would've noticed if other reviewers hadn't pointed it out. However, after working some of the stiffness out of the spine (just for a minute or two), it is perfectly flat now. As I alluded above, after getting the Fire into the cover, I did go around to each elastic to make sure it wasn't folded and make sure the tension in the elastics was relatively evenly distributed. I don't know if maybe that may have resulted in a slightly different position of my Kindle inside this cover compared to the other reviewers who were having apparently more significant problems with the cover lying flat.  All in all, very classy and trim, will work well for disguising the Kindle as a book, appears to hold the Kindle in there securely, and provides some lightweight protection in the unlikely event that I drop the Kindle onto the carpet while using it on the elliptical. It will NOT prop up the Kindle on a table to watch a movie, and I really didn't want a cover with the necessary bulk to be able to do that. (If I actually had the time to sit in one place to watch anything, I'd just turn on the TV!)
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Pre-ordered the cover and Amazon dropped the price to $29.99. Amazon gave me a credit $10. I think the cover is worth the original price of $39.99, but for $29.99 it's a much better value. The black cover matches my Kindle Fire flawlessly. The installation was easy. Just snap the Kindle Fire in place. Overall it's a good fit for the Kindle Fire.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This series is well acted, written, and clearly thought out. I was not expecting to be taken aback in any way by a show that, at first glance appeared to be as much outright nudity as speaking. I was very impressed with the season as a whole.
B0067GVQGI|4.0|I'm following this down to the last episode and the way we are going with the murder of Gabby's stepfather, we may see all of the co-conspirator housewives tried together and ending up at the same jail as cellmates.  This would, of course, make for an entirely new series but I don't honestly think the network has that in mind.<br /><br />Bree's ex-boyfriend, the detective, is sure he can tie her and her buddies to the drifter who disappeared. He's on a vendetta against them since Bree broke up with him.<br /><br />For Lynette's part, she may have finally reached the point where she realizes the boat has sailed with Tom.<br /><br />Susan finally becomes \\"an artist\\" with the aid of Miguel Ferrar, who co-stars as a college art instructor.<br /><br />And Gabby has a newly alcoholic Carlos and the dead stepfather as her bones of contention.  Ironically, she is a lot tougher than Carolos is about death, dying, murder, etc.,<br /><br />So it is definitely watchable but also definitely winding down.
B004A8EI9M|5.0|I am usually not a fan of zombie or vampire genres, in fact I usually specifically avoid these type of shows. I find zombie movies usually to be absurdly atupid and corny..until this show. I saw the reviews on Netflix after it was suggested to me that I check this out, and now I am totally hooked. This show has just about every element you can want: suspense, action, drama, humor, excellent acting, and very keen directing. Its a show of survival as Sherriff Rick Grimes wakes up in a hospital to find everyone dead and has NO idea why. If you like Lost, Prison Break, and shows that etch upon the 'survival' element, this show will grip you. I found this similar to \\"I am Legend\\" in its plot however its a much deeper story line and the characters are more than just ONE lone survivor and his dog. I can't seem to get enough of this show and having just finished season 1, I can not wait to watch Season 2 (thank you for AMC ON-DEMAND!) Don't write this show off and classify it as a zombie horror movie, because its really not. Its an outstanding sci-fi show that will keep you on the edge of your seat every episode....oh by the way, this is NOT for kids in any sense. I would say 16 and up at minimum. get the show or watch it on netflix...NOW!  My new favorite :)
B001UV4XIS|1.0|I have purchased previous Harry Potter movies with the digital copy and have never had a problem downloading an iTunes version. This version however is a STREAMING version, as in you don't actually get to own the copy. I bought this DVD specifically for the digital copy and I am sooooo angry to have been ripped off. I don't have a DVD player, I only wanted the digital version and I want it on my IPAD, not a laptop. And then there's the whole streaming thing which for some people isn't possible because not everyone has high speed Internet. So yah, thanks WB for wasting my money. I will NEVER buy another \\"ultraviolet\\" digital copy again.
B0068QH8V4|4.0|This episode was also enjoyable but also again not like the riveting episodes we once saw in earlier seasons. The case itself is exotic, as usual, and involves a young boy who got sick while trying to emulate his long dead father by becoming a clown. The illness again got so convoluted in diagnosis that I was lost about half way through and just waited for the defining moment when House \\"gets it.\\" The diagnosis was quite surprising and interesting.<br /><br />The interaction among the usual cast of characters is back again.  Taub has child issues as he doesn't want his ex-wife to take his daughter to Oregon. Chase gets to know the young woman doctor better and he tries to pry her background out of her (which House wants to know).  And, best of all, there is an intricate subplot going where House wants to see a fight in Atlantic City with Wilson but his ankle bracelet and rules of parole stop him from going...or do they?
1451627289|3.0|In most alternate history books, the perturbation comes either at or close to the beginning of the book, and the changes are what are the meat of the book.  In this one, it's just the opposite; the large-scale perturbations come close to the end of the book (pages from the end, really) and the changes are only briefly described.    This book is much more character-driven than events-driven.  I found it to be a fairly entertaining read - nothing thrilling or special, but entertaining.
B004N6369Y|1.0|I am less than one third through this book and am going no further.  I read a great deal and, Ms. Steel has always been a favorite.  However, her last few books have been a waste of my time.  If I wanted to know all about the inner workings of a hotel, I could take a course in hotel management.  As it is, I am only looking for a good read.  This book is NOT that!!!    In this day and age, what idiot would allow a small child to wander at will around a hotel?  This kid is too precocious to be real.  Ms. Steel, please don't insult my intelligence ( and my pocketbook) with this kind of dribble.  I expected more of you!!!
B005DOKIYG|1.0|I love my new Kindle Fire, but this case is extremely poor quality. It is definitely not worth $30. Maybe $5 or $6, but not $30. It also smells really bad. I would not recommend this case to anyone. I received it yesterday and I'm sending it back today!
0374158460|4.0|It seems almost unfair and somehow wrong to criticize this ambitious, thoughtful but ultimately imperfect (in the sense that it could be tightened up some) work. Franzen examines and discusses many issues of our time; a work well worth your time.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I bought this case in Grey for my Kindle Fire and think it is a good case.  It was originally $39.99 when purchased but was reduced to $29.99 during the release day and Amazon did provide a $10 credit.  I think at the $30 price point this can be reviewed more favorably than if it was a $40 cover.  The Fire fits snugly in the case and I have no worries or concern that it would fall out.  The case itself is very light and provides optimal coverage.  I read some concerns about the strap, but have no worries about it failing.  Visually I like the case, but when used as a stand it doesn't \\"lock\\" into place and I have a hard time getting the front piece to line up correctly with the back piece.  Multiple viewing angles would also be nice.  The case does show fingerprints and while I have no problems or issues with that I know some do, so I just wanted to state that for those who may care.  Overall, I would imagine this is not the BEST case for the Fire, but as long as the stand doesn't collapse it does the job it says it would and the $30 price point seems fair.
B00005LELD|5.0|But it works great it folds onto it self. Not sure why it didn't come with the lens when purchased. Update 11/28/2012 still using  the rubber hood No problems with this product.
B001UV4XHY|1.0|This is a poor quality DVD. The first time we played it, it skipped briefly more than 5 times in the second half of the movie .
0061969656|4.0|This story is told in the first person from the words of Uhtred, a fictional character in a non-fictional era. The time is the years surrounding 900 AD when King Alfred ruled all the English speaking lands of what would be present day England. At the same time much of England was ruled by the Pagans, the Danes, who came across the seas in huge warships to plunder and occupy Northern and Central England.  Ironically, Uhtred, was himself a Pagan and worshiped the Pagan Gods. He fell in love with King Alfred's Sister, a Christian, and fought for King Alfred and the Christians. Needless to say, Uhtred was never trusted by the King's priests although he won key battles in defeating the Danes. After Alfred's death, Uhtred continued his loyalty to Alfred's son, Edward.  This is a powerful story of the great battles for England. Uthred fought with two swords, first his long one, \\"Serpent Breath\\", was used when he had a lot of room; then he had a shorter one, \\"Wasp-Sting\\" which he used behind the shield walls where men fought bloody battles face to face. This was where many battles were won or lost.  This is not just a story of battles, but of the culture of the time, of the hardships that bonded people. This is of a time when a Sorceress, a witch, or a magician could dictate the future or the outcome of a battle just by making up lies. Uhtred was clever, he believed in all Gods, learned from people around him and was a powerful warrior.   I will definitely be waiting to follow him into battle as he protects England and King Edward in Bernard Cornwell's next Saxon Tale.
B005KELW26|5.0|I purchased this in advance of the release of the Kindle Fire because it appeared to be simple and relatively inexpensive.  Well, it is both of those, plus the purple color is far more muted than in the picture presented and it makes it look rather impressive.  It feels wonderful (like leather) and doesn't add to the bulk of the Kindle at all.  A great purchase. I would highly recommend this to family and friends, or purchase it for my brother as an inexpensive Christmas gift.
1416562605|3.0|The White Tiger didn't blow me away, but it is an enjoyable read.  The characters are interesting and the story is engrossing.  It gives the reader a personal look into what it means to be wealthy or poor in India.  It also delves into the corruption that exists in the government and the influence of other cultures on India, while examining the prospect of India's rise in the world economy. I would recommend it to anyone who is in between books and is looking for a good piece of fiction.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I saw a lot of positive reviews, and I also watched a video about this case. I will love this case, but I ordered it more than 10 days ago with other two items. I got those two items last week, but  I haven't heard anything from you. Could you please tell me why does it take this long? Did the factory stop making these cases? I hope I could get this case before I go on winter break. because I left my college address to you guys. Please hurry up, I really can't wait to get this case.
B004J2TPSI|1.0|This is an item of terrible quality. The button didn't work properly and it doesn't connect to devices like it is suppose to. I am a 10 at technology and I rate this product as a 1.
B005ZTFPFQ|4.0|Looks great on my Kindle Fire.  I think I was mostly interested in the Centipede/Millipede games, but decided to get the remaining games, since they were only $10.      Controls seem to be pretty well done.  I think I like the virtual onscreen trackball.  One major issue with the Arcade version of Centipede is that the sound effects are wrong.  They may be the sound effects from the Atari 2600 version ?  Even though there's a free version of Millipede on Chrome browsers, playing it with a mouse was not a great experience. The virtual trackball in the Millipede game on my Kindle Fire really takes the game to a whole new level. Sometimes, it feels like I'm actually playing the original arcade version !  I took a look at some of the other arcade games in the pack -- they seem fairly well done as well, in terms of designing the virtual controls.. If you have a Kindle Fire and you like the old arcade games, such as Millipede, Asteroids, Tempest, Battlezone, etc. you should definitely get this app !
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|Bought this at first thinking it was a new Metallica album, the wife likes those guys. Thankfully, we read the insert and some theatrical websites first to understand what this \\"Lulu\\" thing is all about. Knowing the history of the subject, and starting up the album with an open mind (who's this Lou Reed guy?!) really helped us accept and like the album. Do not expect another Metallic album to rock your ass off. This is essentially spoken free verse poetry of Lou Reed, with background played by Metallica. Looking at the album this way, it is actually really good.  I am actually impressed by Metallica in their background role. I never expected them to play 'soothing' songs, but some of these they have really shown their mellow and somewhat emotional side.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|I was somewhat skeptical when the package arrived, even considering Marware's commitment to reducing the amount of packaging they are using, and I continued to be underwhelmed after I opened it.  It is flimsy and the stand is poor quality and at best ineffective.  I do not feel it offers any protection to the device, which is one of the primary reasons I bought it.  Additionally, if the stand was effective, it would have been of more use if it also held the device in a vertical position as well as the horizontal to make reading easier.  Needless to say, it is going back.  Don't waste your money.  It is not worth even $10.99, much less the current asking price of $29.99.
0743201140|1.0|I bought this booking supposedly new and it was supposed to have an active code-which it didn't. I was totally disappointed. I bought the book to take the test.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|Drake is one of the best out and this album proves he's not done yet. An over all mellow feel, though not as mellow as thank me later, this album is definitely a perfect mix of so far gone and thank me later with a new sound thrown in as well. Drake's voice is very diverse sometimes reminiscent of lil wayne and even kid cudi on this album, sometimes mono tone but always making up for it with a smoothly sung chorus/bridge. This album will not disappoint.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I initially gave the Feedly app a low rating because it couldn't access Google Reader due to the way Amazon set up their Kindles.  It seemed bizarre that Feedly would have been approved as compatible with the device when it wasn't.  All that was visible were the prepopulated feeds that the app comes with.<br /><br />Well, with the latest version, 7.1, that's all changed, and reading my RSS feeds on my Fire through Feedly is now absolutely amazing, just like the web experience. =)
0060936223|2.0|This book started out interesting, but in my opinion it loses steam and gets increasingly boring as it progresses.  This makes no sense, because as the author's \\"story\\" moves along, she runs into a great many celebrities and poets and rock stars of her time. But her prose reads like a series of facebook status updates or tweets.  \\"This day I went here, I wore these pants and this shirt, it was snowing. I had lobster and xyz famous person paid for my meal\\"<br />There really is no story to speak of - just a series of events, narrated sparsely: I met RM, we moved in with each other but took other lovers, he hustled and I kept encouraging him to take pictures. Later I got married, wrote a book of poems and he died. That actually sounds a LOT more interesting than it is in the book.<br />In addition to no story, there is almost no character development. We barely get a sense of who Patti is, other than she likes to compare everything to Baudelaire, Genet, and drop their names every other page (literally). Mapplethorpe is somewhat more fleshed out, but her adoring approach doesn't really gel with his actions as she reports them.  She tells you he is brilliant, but there needs to be more showing, less telling.<br />She names dozens of contemporaries who she runs into or hangs out with in the course of the book, but she does very little to provide the reader with fleshed out people with personalities. I gained no insight into these persons. If I didn't already have a picture in my head of someone she named, they rarely took form based on her description. Many of the characters started to blend together and I honestly couldn't keep them straight. It doesnt help that there is more than one David, more than one Sam, etc.<br />So many people I know and respect loved this book, so as they say \\"your mileage may vary.\\"  But I regret having paid for it, and spent the time reading it. There is no there, there.
1853286397|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2LEJHIUBIOL4T]]READ THIS AUTHORITATIVE GUIDE TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION  REGULATIONS<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />The Information Commissioner (2002-2009) Richard Thomas CBE provides the Foreword to Susan Wolf's `Environmental Information Regulations', which gives you a good idea of the book's authority, value, reliability and readability too.  As Thomas remarks quite rightly, the book is `clearly written and accessible to both beginners and experienced information practitioners'.<br /><br />As the subtitle indicates, this is a practical guide  to the panoply of  Environmental Information Regulations (or EIR) within an aspect of public life in which transparency is the aim, not to mention accountability, public participation and the overall desirability of exposing practices and policies that impact negatively on the environment.<br /><br />The book delves into the background and purpose of the Regulations and discusses their practical aspects.  It provides an analysis of the relationship between the Regulations and related legislation, including the Freedom of Information Act which, interestingly, came into effect on the same day as the Regulations.<br /><br />It is not surprising then, that the EIR have possibly languished somewhat in the shadow of the Freedom of Information Act and therefore have not been as widely noted, inwardly digested or even understood.  This book will, fortunately, address this difficulty in lucid and concise fashion, with the entirely practical emphasis you would expect from a Law Society publication.<br /><br />As you would also expect, this invaluable work of reference provides all the relevant tables of cases, statutes, and statutory instruments, as well as a table of European and international legislation.  The Appendix contains the Regulations themselves and there is also an excellent index.  A boon to information rights practitioners, this book will also aid those in public authorities who must make informed decisions regarding the disclosure -- or non-disclosure -- of environmental information.  The book is up to date as at September 2011.st make informed decisions regarding the disclosure -- or non-disclosure -- of environmental information.  The book is up to date as at September 2011.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|There have been several complaints of the stand feature not offering adequate  support.  I believe this is due to a misunderstanding of its use. After folding the cover and the edge placed in the indentation of the back cover, the elastic band can be placed under the folded front cover. This holds it securely in place. No need to due anything else. It is secure and works well. The ten dollar price drop makes it even better. I am very satisfied.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Provides good weather information, including hourly for the day and extended forcast. Also gives easy access to current weather under notifications, though id rather see the day or two-day forcast there. The app is a little jerky, and doesn't respond to internal gyro on the Fire (always orients up, regardless of tablet position) but still overall good.
B005DMNS4A|5.0|I'm going to agree with Bruce on this one.  I haven't heard the vinyl since the early '90s, when I went to cd.  Yes, I loved the vinyl when I was 18 and all the years I had it, but I don't remember it.  I wasn't thrilled with the first cd version, other than I had my favorite Who album again; this one sounds much better than that.  Roger, John and Keith are prominent; what's wrong with that?!?!  I'm a half-a$$ed guitar player and I don't mind Pete's playing minimized a bit (and just a bit; use the EQ) even though that's what I usually listen for most.  Overall, for me, this brings Quadrophenia to life again, and I'm very happy with it.  Thanks, Pete!
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I love all the Lee Childs' books with the character of Jack Reacher in it.  I hear there is going to be a movie made from this series of books.  Please, please please do not have Tom Cruise play Jack Reacher.  It ruins all of what I have imagined in my mind of what Reacher should look like.

B004GJDQT8|1.0|This app is not \\"available instantly\\". You laboriously peck your email address into the little box, and then you wait, and wait, and wait for the email. Why not just put it in the regular Android App Market? That really IS instant. Why try to force users to jump through some long idiotic series of arbitrary hoops?  Well, I waited, made the stupid video on this page go away (twice), and jumped through all the completely unnecessary hoops to get it to install, and finally discovered: This isn't the Amazon Mobile app at all! It's the Amazon App Store app. What?! Seriously, it's the wrong app! What a pain. All that hassle, and they can't even give you the right download file. The idea is that they make you go through an extremely painful process to download a completely different app, which you can then use to download the one you actually want. Apparently, that's explained somewhere in the moronic chirpy video or in the depths of the fine print somewhere. Well, end users can't be trusted to care about your vanity as much as you do. Tell them what they need to know clearly and simply, immediately and upfront. I've been writing software quite a few years now, and every time some idiot says \\"Hey, don't worry about it, we can just force the user to read five pages of text and do something incredibly inconvenient!\\", the next thing you know the customers are all emailing you about how your software doesn't work. Why? Because YOU are paid a fat salary to make your software work, and THEY are the ones paying you.  I can't believe this, it's like a bad joke. Android has a nearly flawless software distribution model, and somehow these guys made it ten times as hard for the user, and then broke it. Why? Why do you do that to your customers? Hard to figure. Maybe they hired a customer-relations expert from Netflix, or Bank of America.  To be fair, this is the first bad Amazon experience I can recall having in about ten years as a customer, so give 'em that much credit. But still,you have to wonder what somebody was thinking. Just a big steaming ball of assorted fail.

Yes, it looks as though we're going to have the usual fight between good and evil, but after reading the 1000-odd pages of this book I'm still not at all sure which characters belong to which side, and the universe in which it is set is surprisingly original.I'm waiting impatiently for subsequent books in the series.

I got it today, so I don't know how long the cover will last (I've never had a trutone Bible). But the cover is imitation leather, feels great in the hand, and just looks pretty cool. The content is good, too, with extensive notes, maps, charts, etc. Recommended.

B00631HASU|5.0|As an avid Sparkle addict (via iPad and iPod touch), I've been eagerly awaiting it's release on Android for some time. Fans of Luxor / Zuma will find themselves in familiar territory, while newbies to this genre of casual game will find an addictive and exciting adventure that does not disappoint.  Sparkle's conceit is simple: chains of multicolored orbs snake their way through chutes towards a black hole. In order to stop their progression, you must fire your own orbs to create three-of-a-kind matches. As you progress, you'll learn to create chains of breaks as well as maximize your use of power-ups which appear every time you clear three consecutive groups.   Though it seems simple at first, Sparkle justifies its $5 price in the slow challenge that builds as you advance through the quest. Just when you think you've mastered the game, Sparkle adds new colors and complex level designs that will drive you to the challenge mode to practice lest you lose your precious lives.  Since levels last a few minutes at most, Sparkle is a perfect game to pick up and play when you don't have much time. With three difficulty modes for the quest, and an endless survival mode, this is one game that will keep you entertained (and at times, unbelievably frustrated) for a long time.

B005HV6Y5W|1.0|Probably the movie trailer shows 80% of the talking that appeared in the movie, the other parts were meaningless shots of natural landscapes and boring music, with stupid whisper voice overs!<br /><br />Believe me, IT IS NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE...<br /><br />Probably the only person in this whole wide world who can understand what the movie is all about is the director!!!
006145205X|4.0|It's hard to be an optimist in these troubled economic times, but Matt Ridley is one...and for good reason. In \\"The Rational Optimist,\\" Ridley shows how modern society is becoming more prosperous by means of collaboration based on exchange and specialization, rather than by means of individual or state intention and control. If that sounds to you like Friedrich Hayek's notion that prosperity is a product of human action, though not of human design, then you're right. In fact, Ridley is the 2011 winner of the Manhattan Institute's Hayek Prize. Anyway, read this book. It might even cheer you up a bit as you contemplate the bad economy we're currently living through.
1451648537|2.0|Walter Isaacson and John Sculley have something in common: in both cases Steve Jobs hired the wrong guy.  The remarkable thing about Steve Jobs isn't that he had a nice wife and nice kids and a nice house, as wonderful as that is, it is mundane. The remarkable thing about Steve Jobs is how he revolutionized every industry he touched. Yet Isaacson gives as much attention and importance to the mundane as he does to the remarkable. Every chapter leaves the reader unfulfilled and wanting to know more about the BIG things that made Steve Jobs so remarkable as a visionary and as a CEO.  What is most disappointing is how sloppy Isaacson is in the technical details. He is a lazy researcher who doesn't bother to check his facts. For example he says that the Mac UI has a file menu on every window. No Walter, that's Windows you are thinking of. A trivial detail sure, but indicative of the lazy research that riddles this shallow, incomplete book. The crime is that he had access to the prime source and yet seems to miss the point every time he writes about anything Steve Jobs innovated on.  The book is written as one big characature. Overly simplifying Open vs. Closed, Design vs. Function, Art vs. Science, and just about every other contrast he tries to draw in the biography. For example he doesn't understand how \\"Open\\" software like Microsoft Windows or Android are in many ways closed. The difference isn't as black and white as Isaacson tries to paint it. This oversimplification plagues the book throughout every chapter and reveals a disturbing lack of intellectual curiosity the author has on topics associated with one of the greatest biographical subjects of our time.  The book is not entirely without merit. The 'voice' of the author is enjoyable and the way it is written topically, not chronologically, is interesting. Though this format caused the author to repeat himself frequently - to the point it got a little ridiculous, even tiresome. For anyone not knowledgable about the subject and curious about the Great Innovator of our time there are many other better sources. Triumph of the Nerds on PBS is a good start. Also here on Amazon I would recommend you take a look at Infinite Loop by Michael Malone, Revolution in the Valley by Andy Hertzfeld, Apple Confidential 2.0 by Owen Linzmayor, Insanely Great by Steve Levy and The Second Coming of Steve Jobs by Alan Deutschman.
B001EIOOV8|5.0|Action, Drama, surprises, and fast moving blood and gore.  Never underestimate another man's greed could describe this one.  A rags to riches back to rags again story.  But there is plenty of drama and action along the way (and a few giggles too).  Bet you can't watch it just once.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|i dont understand why everyone is giving it such bad reviews. it works just fine and its really light and well made.
0553801473|2.0|At this point I'd suggest most readers new to the series stop after book three.  If book 6, 7,8,12 manage to move the plot forward, then I'd suggest pushing through 4 and 5 to get there. Too many characters, too little plot development.  Without plot its difficult to have drama.  Without drama, tension, release, what's the point?
B0053O89WY|5.0|The Season 5 set will be the best so far!  Especially the Halloween episode!!!  I have watched the original broadcast and on-line feeds at least ten times!  ALWAYS cracks me up!  This is a BRILLIANT show with a BRILLIANT cast and I hope it goes on for a LONG time!!!

It is a keeper  Fits great! Stand works well and Amazon gave me $10 back on the whole deal. Is it worth $39? Yes, I believe it is! I also own an iPad2 and paid double that price for similar quality cover from Apple!  FYI folks, there is nothing wrong with this case for your Kindle Fire. I am not sure why all the bad reviews. This case fits the bill for the device. I highly recommend it.  -Linda
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was right up my alley. I'm just going to assume it was written for me. King made the character my age, there are two characters with the names of my children, and I'm a big Jack Finney fan. I really felt the spirit of Finney in this, and little did I know that King was thinking the same thing and came close to dedicating this to him, opting to honor his granddaughter instead. I'll just chalk all these coincidences up to the harmonics of too many strings.

B004K4AUZW|5.0|I bought this album on iTunes the moment it came out, I purchased a hard copy of it as well, and it still is one of the best albums I've ever heard. I still find new things to love about it and it has been out for six months. The songs have a common thread, yet share their own unique styles. Gaga's vocals are unmatched and are beautifully amplified throughout the great beats of this record. This is definitely an album for this generation and it's not going away any time soon.<br />A solid piece of work, Gaga. Congratulations.
B004EPZ06Q|1.0|Being stuck on airplanes most of the time this ultraviolet \\"fake digital copy\\" is useless! Wifi is usually 10 bucks to use so again there's more. They should NOT be able to call them digital copies! They are online copies! Just buy the Blu ray version. They can get the ultraviolet crap version back and use them for coasters!
B005POK858|4.0|Fun game, basic sounds, interesting entertainment. I am not all the way through the game by any means. This is due to the fact that I too am experiencing the random reboot issue, along with the sound issues, with the Droid X. I had more to say, but there are better/more in depth reviews of this app already.

B0053YGYO4|3.0|I've been a pretty big fan of Coldplay ever sense they first broke out a decade ago.  They've become incredibly popular, and much like Creed or Nickelback, when you get that popular a lot of people start to hate you.  Despite that fact that it isn't very \\"cool\\" to like Coldplay, my softer side has always found appeal in Chris Martin's beautiful melodies and strong lyrics.  For 8 years I had never heard a Coldplay song I didn't like, even though some were better than others.  Even all of their B-sides were excellent and probably deserved a mainstream release.  As much as I enjoyed A Rush Of Blood To The Head (2002) and X&Y (2005), I wondered if they might become stagnant or redundant as time went on.  But no, in 2008 they released Viva La Vida which completely blew me away.  The band expanded their sound into something much more epic and unique, and it was one of the smartest albums I'd heard in a long long time.  I couldn't wait to hear more material from them, even if it was just more of the same.  After a long 3 year wait, the band finally released Mylo Xyloto.  Once again, it took me by surprise, but not in the same way...<br /><br />This is not the same band that gave us songs like Shiver, Trouble, Moses, or Talk.  Make no mistake, I'm all for a band experimenting and breaking new ground, but Coldplay has seem to cross genres from being an alternative folk band to a mainstream power-pop group.  When I first heard the single Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall, I thought I had accidentally clicked a link to a new song from Katy Perry or Kanye West.  The music and the beat is very much like something you'd hear on a mainstream pop radio station that would play the latest from Pink and Lady Gaga.  Luckily, Chris Martin's voice keeps the song likeable.  I admit that it grew on me more over time, but it's still nothing as good from earlier releases.  The next single is Paradise, and again I wasn't very impressed.  Many fans who don't like this album say that this is the one good song on here, but I still don't care for it.  Hurts Like Heaven opens the album and even though it's playful and maybe even cheesy, I actually enjoy it.  My favorite track on here is Charlie Brown, which has a lot of beautiful sounds and some heartfelt singing.  If the album had more tracks like this and Don't Let It Break Your Heart, I would have given Mylo Xyloto 4 or 5 stars.  Another decent tune is Major Minus, even though it seems like they're giving an obvious nod to U2's material from the '90s.  The rest of the album is kind of plain.  The songs are definitely using different sounds, but most of them just didn't grab me.  I don't hate this album at all, but only a couple songs are worth getting excited about.  Actually there is one song on here I absolutely don't like... It's called Princess Of China and it features singing from Rihanna.  Much like Waterfall, this song has a very generic pop sound, which is just odd at first when Chris is singing.  But once Rihanna chimes in for a verse and chorus, the song officially becomes music that I hate.  It's the only song Coldplay has ever put out that I absolutely can not listen to.  I'm glad the group has expanded their sound, and for all I care they can use all the keyboards and samples they want as long as the music is cool.  But once they take on a trashy generic pop music sound, that crosses a line.  Most of the album is still pretty decent and not nearly as bad as some people have made it out to be.  But to me, Coldplay went from being a band who could do no wrong to putting out a thoroughly mediocre album.  There are a couple songs on here that sound like classic Coldplay, and I really enjoy half of Mylo Xyloto.  In the future though, I think the band needs to go back to finding inspiration in The Beatles and U2 rather than Katy Perry and Black-Eyed Peas.g on here, but I still don't care for it.

B004498KPU|4.0|. . . One of the main reasons I bought this collection.<br />Another reason:  the publicized release of \\"One More Chance\\".<br /><br />\\"Another Part of Me\\" (by Sony) is fun to watch.  I recall seeing this on T.V.<br /><br />\\"They Don't Care About Us\\" is interesting. (Shot in a real prison environment?)<br /><br />\\"Bad\\" is good.  MJ could have made more movies based on his character Daryl-Home Boy.<br />Maybe about transforming those thugs he called friends.<br />I wonder how the guys who killed the real Daryl feel watching MJ doing their story?<br />This short film will make Michael Jackson perpetually popular.<br />The 2012 MJ calendar is focused on the \\"Bad\\" era. Grabbed that one up!

B002TYZKIM|4.0|The song entitled \\"This Is It\\" should not be in the music CD for This Is It.<br />Watch the clip for the rehearsal of  \\"Earth Song\\" and note that Michael Jackson refers to having only four years to save the Planet Earth; after that the harmful changes are irreversible as he states.  With respect to this subject he feels so strongly about, he clearly states: \\"this is it\\".  How could the producers, directors and estate administrators miss this salient point?  It is quite upsetting.  Hearing the unreleased song \\"This Is It\\" (two versions of same)seems so out of place.  Luckily, the DVD is just decent enough to distract from what appears me so obvious.  (12-01-11:  Kenny Ortega's trial testimony does imply that he was very aware of what MJ meant by \\"This Is It\\"; he says that MJ wanted to promote his messages about the saving the Earth and helping children.  So, why confuse and include two versions of an old song that seems unrelated to MJ's intent?)<br /><br />\\"Earth Song\\" in the DVD was rehearsed on the day before Michael died, according to the manslaughter trial of his doctor.  It is priceless to watch him rehearsing \\"Earth Song\\" and \\"Thriller\\" on this day.  However, the pre-trial matters suggest that there is a lot more rehearsal to watch and more material of Michael's final days are going to be produced for us.<br /><br />The DVD and the movie show how thin Michael was and his discomfort level of returning to the stage.  His talent and skill were so great that we cannot really comprehend his pain, suffering and his actual condition.<br /><br />On the lighter side, watch Judith Hill and MJ rehearse \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\".<br />They sang well together.  I think MJ really enjoyed that gig.  Too bad she did not seem to perform with him--but their singing complemented each other.

B005J7K964|4.0|This print has a soft spot in my heart because it is the print that first introduced me to Metropolis. I've had the Laserdisc for years now and always dreamed of the day the it would officially get a release. Well that day is here with mixed blessing.<br /><br />The video: Is pretty bad... and in a lot of spots very bad. I think the laserdisc is actually a better transfer. They did absolutely nothing to the copy used. (Which is one of only a handful left in existence from what I understand.) There is dirt, scratches and all manor of crud just floating around on the copy. Also the contrast is WAY off. Even for an old print of this movie it's pretty bad, almost unwatchable in parts. I think they 'overcooked' it in the compression oven.  But I was not really buying this for the print. I have both the Complete Metropolis Blu-Ray as well as the WONDERFUL Metropolis Redux that was done by a fan that took the restored footage and recreated the Moroder print with it.<br /><br />The sound: ahhhh the sound. This is where the disk shines. Not to some mind blowing extent but to hear the wonderful 80's score in 5.1 is just great fun. It sounds great and is well worth the price of the disk.  There is good range and the base booms (almost too much at times). No great track by track remastering but it plays much better then the VHS or LD ever did.<br /><br />So now with the Metropolis Redux DVD and the Kino Blu Ray I can play the audio in 5.1 from the Blu-ray and watch the video in remastered clarity from the DVD and get to see this version in a presentation that is almost too good for what it really is.<br /><br />I doubt that this version will be out for long so even if you are on the fence, pick it up now because its good to have to show people what we had before and why what we have now is sooooooooo precious .
B005LZW8FO|5.0|I am a self described cinephile, I try to watch at least one movie a day. (luckily a lack of any sort of enjoyable social life allows me this small joy)<br /><br />I have seen enough thought provoking movies, to know when the questions being asked are genuinely interesting or tainted by banality.<br /><br />This movie is by far the most interesting movie I have seen this year, and the best drama I have seen so far (and yes I do admit The King's Speech, Shame, Carnage and Drive are close contenders)<br /><br />Previous reviews have summed up the movie enough that to reiterate would seem...well annoying. But I must say the one question that haunted me the most, that this movie asked in a way that no other has, and is the sole reason that I beckon all of you to give this movie one viewing is:<br /><br />\\"If you met yourself, what would you do?\\" Every thought you have, every emotion you feel is being felt by the mirror copy in front of you, so would there be anything of substance to be said out loud?<br /><br />That to me was pretty haunting, I know my community college philosophy probably won't strike anyone's mind as life alerting, but to me this movie did.<br /><br />The acting, could have been a bit better but I do believe Brit Marling did an exceptional job for a novice. You literally feel the weight of her guilt begin to drag you down too in some parts. So kudos.
B001HN6922|1.0|Too preachy.  CARS 2 pushes the environmental \\"sustainable\\" agenda, BIG TIME.  Returned it and will not allow kids to watch it because we do not believe environmental, nor any other agenda, should be pushed.  Do not need movies telling us to buy and believe in alternative fuel, like CARS 2 does.  It is one thing to choose on your own to buy alternative fuel.  It is another to have Disney/other characters telling you to buy it.  Not the place of media to tell us what to do, nor what choices to make.

1419702238|4.0|My kids just received this book and they enjoyed it.  It's a fine addition to the Wimpy Kid series, and after leafing through the book myself, I have found some fun, clever things (Extreme Sports Stix!).  But is my copy unique?  Our pages were bound upside down in relation to the cover; open the front cover, and you see the last page upside down.  Flip the book over and open the BACK cover, and there's the first page.  Maybe it's some kind of in-joke that we haven't discovered yet.  We aren't sure if we should be delighted at having a mis-bound copy!

B005HSG3TC|4.0|Like many other people, I just want a light-weight cover to protect my Fire from minor occurrences.  I also like the idea of being able to stand it up in landscape to watch movies and tv shows.  Although expensive at $39, the MicroShell Folio seemed to fit the bill.  Then, after pre-ordering, the reviews started to flood in.  Most of the negative reviews were coming from folks that hadn't yet received their device.  The product is CERTIFIED for the Fire, but still I was concerned.  I was expecting a total piece of junk that I was going to have to return.  I'm happy to report that my concern was unfounded.  I received my Fire and the case yesterday.  The case is very well made.  The case fits the Fire perfectly.  The product description is absolutely accurate.  It functions as designed.  In a sentence - the Marware MicroShell Folio cover is everything it is supposed to be.  At $39, the case costs 20% of the Fire's price.  That is very steep,  but not outside the realm of smartphone accessory pricing.  But yesterday, to Amazon's credit, they dropped the price by ten bucks.  Compared to similar products from manufacturers like Otterbox and Acase, the price is now pretty much competitive.  If you too are looking for a cover (not a vault) for your Fire, and you understand that the product description is accurate, you should be fairly pleased with this case at the new, discounted price.
0061969656|1.0|Good historical fiction takes what we know from written sources and, sometimes, myth and lore (Beowulf, for example, is clearly a heroic myth but gives us insight into military culture of the time) then weaves a plausible fictional tale around that.<br /><br />This is not good historical fiction. The author takes history and, essentially, rewrites it, giving credit for victories in battle and state decisions to his fictional character instead of the known, historical persons. This is akin to writing historical fiction about the American Revolution wherein George Washington does not cross the Delaware and attack Trenton, but instead, cowers miles away in fear as a subordinate actually leads the Patriot forces to victory.<br /><br />Edward, son of King Alfred The Great, is portrayed in this book as a frightened, uncertain and inexperienced youth who cannot lead Wessex, so the fictional character Uhtred must do so in his stead. Of course, this is rubbish. Edward, by the time of Alfred's death, was already a seasoned campaigner, having commanded men in the field for years before his oft-ill father's death (Alfred suffered from a debilitating illness many modern historians theorise could have been Crohn's Disease). From what we know (as opposed to the author's fantasies), Edward was a capable military leader carefully balancing resources and forces in a Wessex that was beset on all sides by threats.<br /><br />When Edward took the burden of kingship upon the death of Alfred The Great in 899 AD, he was thirty - hardly a youth. In the historical record, Edward was leading armies as early as 893, putting Danes to flight at Farnham and later besieging them on Thorney Island. Edward was very much a warrior-king and certainly not the hand-wringing, indecisive youngster this book portrays him as.<br /><br />The author makes a great many errors (or &#34;artistic license&#34;) including having the fictional Uhtred having numerous sexual trysts with Edward's sister Æthelflæd when, of course, there is no historical evidence for such claptrap. She is portrayed as, again, someone who must &#34;take charge&#34; in place of her brother Edward who can't do anything for himself. The historical Æthelflæd was married to Ealdorman Æthelred of Mercia and the pair worked hand in glove with Edward using the same strategy pioneered by Alfred to repel the Danes and make significant territorial gains at their expense. After her husband's death, Æthelflæd commanded her Mercian troops on a number of occasions. It is a pity the author chooses to portray such an intelligent and capable woman as a disobedient bimbo. That's what passes for entertainment these days, I guess.<br /><br />The author makes too many minor errors to list. As one example, the author's Uhtred commands his men to wear their &#34;best mail armor&#34; as if they had a closet full of them. Historically, this is rubbish. Armor of any type would have been rare and most warriors of the time period would have fought without any at all. The author makes the error of referring to military retainers as &#34;housecarls&#34; instead of &#34;thegns&#34; (pronounced &#34;thanes&#34;). This is, in fact, a Danish term and didn't come into usage by the English until the time of Canute more than a century later!<br /><br />In addition to the author's rewriting history is a disturbing, ceaseless and all-pervading hatred of Christianity. Nearly all the Christian churchmen (with the expection of those sharing Uhtred's capacity for &#34;rutting&#34; with serving maids and slave girls) are portrayed as evil, depraved, stupid, malevolent and scheming figures who are secretly &#34;in control&#34;. The author has Uhtred view the ruins of an old Roman arena and, when told Christians were thrown to wild beasts there in the past, Uhtred thinks: &#34;Some things are just too good to be true and so I was not sure I believed him.&#34;<br /><br />The author has both Alfred The Great and his son Edward essentially as puppets of the Christian church so the fictional Uhtred must do all the thinking and must save Wessex. Of course, this is rubbish. We know from history that Alfred was a pious man, but on occasion angered the Church by siezing church lands, awarding them to royal thegns who could raise troops and defend those lands. The Church wasn't happy, but practical matters of defence trumped his love of the Church when needed. Does that sound like someone controlled by the evil Christians?<br /><br />It is interesting that the author himself states his primary source of information for the time period (besides comic books, I suppose) is the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was a product of the same Christian churchmen the author heaps so much scorn upon! Frankly, we would know little of this time period were it not for the Christian church the author's Uhtred (and, presumably, the author himself) hates.<br /><br />As someone who has read extensively on the subject of Anglo-Saxon England, I would say this book is of little value unless you are a naughty 14 year-old who wishes to read about cutting other men's heads off and &#34;rutting&#34; with slave girls. The real history of this time period and of the men who began the process of fashioning a unified England out of numerous petty kingdoms in the face of constant threats to their very existence is exciting enough without changing it one iota. After all, in reality, Wessex survived and prevailed without the author's fictional Uhtred and I would challenge Amazon customers to read the real history instead of this fabricated one.s puppets of the Christian church so the fictional Uhtred must do all the thinking and must save Wessex.

B00005JKDR|5.0|I love Pixar movies, but originally wasn't too impressed with this offering. Having a baby changed all of that, however.<br /><br />Once we stumbled across some 'Monster's Inc.' while my then-two-year-old son was in the room. He was instantly transfixed, something about the shape of the characters and the world enraptured him. After his first exposure, we got incessant demands to see this: \\"Watch Monster Mike! Watch Monster Mike!\\"<br /><br />I would have figured some of the subject matter (using children's screams as energy, the villian, etc.) would be a little dark for a two year old, but he absolutely loves it!  My son (and therefore, I) saw this movie at least 20 times, often split across multiple days. Even though it's been almost a year since we first started watching, he still loves it.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- nice animation, cute characters<br />- great voice acting from Goodman, Crystal, Buscemi, and more! See if you can recognize Waternoose's voice<br />- interesting story and plotline<br />- lots of details. My son absolutely, positively loves the idea of the doors.<br />- DVD has worked reliably and has good video encoding quality. No complaints!<br /><br />Con:<br />- none. It's a sweet movie that gets a little better each time you watch it.
B005DOKIYG|2.0|I was so disappointed with this cover.  I agree with some of the other reviews, it does smell bad.  I'm not an expert, but I think the smell might go away if it's left out a few days.  The concern would be, what was put on it to make it smell that bad to start with.  The real kicker is the sleeve really doesn't have the quality you would expect for $30.  it's very thin and flimsy.  The one good thing about this whole  experience is that amazon is very good with returns.  I'll be returning mine.

0439023491|5.0|I cannot put down this series. These books are just incredible!<br /><br />\\"Catching Fire\\" picks up right where \\"The Hunger Games\\" left off. Katniss is in big trouble after her little berry stunt at the end of the Hunger Games, which President Snow feels was an embarrassment to the Capitol and everything their government holds near and dear. So he has decided that Katniss must pay. First she has to give up little things, and then she realizes that her whole future might be completely mapped out for her, and THEN the unthinkable happens, and Katness may very well be forced to pay the price with her life.<br /><br />\\"Catching Fire\\" is amazing.

1451629184|5.0|In my English class we are working on a project about memoirs. My English teacher asked us to research a topic that interests you and while searching, this book A stolen life by Jaycee Dugard caught my eye.  I'm sure most of you know about Jaycee Lee Dugard, who was kidnapped at age 11, in 1991. She was finally rescued after 18 years, in 2009. While on her way to school, just minutes from her home, Phillip Garrido, and his wife, Nancy, kidnapped her off the street and shoved them into their vehicle. For 18 years, they kept Jaycee hidden in their backyard and brainwashed her into thinking it would be unsafe if she ever tried to leave. They wouldn't even let her speak her real name. They made her dependent on them both physically and emotionally, and even made Jaycee feel empathy for them. Phillip also repeatedly forced Jaycee to have sexual relations with him, and she gave birth to his two daughters while in captivity, the first at age 14 I believe that this memoir is the first time Jaycee has spoken at great length about her 18 year ordeal. I cannot even begin to fathom what she went through. While reading her story, I couldn't even imagine something like this had really happened, but it did. It sickens me that the man who ruined her entire life is the father of her children. It also sickens me that Phillip made the girls refer to Nancy as their mother, and Jaycee as their sister. The Garrido's are truly disturbed and twisted people and I hope they get what they deserve in jail.  This story is heartbreaking, disturbing, and worst of all, true. I highly recommend it. Everyone should know the truth about what this poor girl endured, and who better to hear it from then Jaycee herself? I am so happy she is working towards taking her life back. This story is a true testimony to what the human spirit can endure when faced with the unthinkable.  My Rating: 5/5
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is one of the best reads of this year!  A poetic page turner, and a love story; a magical battle of the wits set in a fabulously mysterious traveling circus.  This book has the potential to become an instant classic.

0439023521|5.0|Ok so i have to admit that i purchased this book for my daughter not knowing anything about other than it had a  great rating. The book arrived promptly(within two days).<br />My 11 year at first was not into the idea of this book, but upon some persuasion she started reading it. She cannot stop talking about the book. She is excited every night when its time to read and cant wait to finish so she can start the next book in the series.<br /><br />I have downloaded the whole series on my kindle so i can read along with her. I was pleasantly surprised and really loved the series. Katniss is a wonderful strong female character.
0307891372|5.0|First off, unlike other game guides, this guide is huge (655 pages long) and it contains answers to nearly every question you are likely to ask about Skyrim. It contains detailed information on character creation, training, inventory, the beasts you'll encounter, and a complete list of quests. Plus it contains an atlas which lists every place of importance and every dungeon location (with maps), the mobs you will encounter in the dungeon, and a loot list. Also included is a 31\\" by 21\\" fold-out map with all cities, towns, rivers, roads and other places of interest. If you are at all serious about playing Skyrim, you need this guide.

B005D9B26E|3.0|I'm not about to shell out more than $100 for anything, so the Smile, Some Girls and Quadrophenia deluxe editions won't make it into my house. So the good news is that you can download all the music for a fraction of the price. I was pretty excited to see this on iTunes for $24 and bought it right away but should have waited. It's $19 on Amazon and $16 on eMusic. Live and learn.   I think the remix sounds great and a lot of the bonus material is pretty cool until you realize that all (?) the bonus tracks seem to be Townshend demos with nothing really new. This is too bad, since Who versions of a lot of the outtakes exist. Three were featured on the Quadrophenia movie soundtrack, and the full band version of \\"Joker James\\" is pretty lively. On the other hand, the Townshend-only version of \\"Helpless Dancer\\" is embarrassing.    The only way the deluxe set works is for someone who has some extra money and wants to express big love to a less wealthy Who fanatic, and gives it as a present.
B00243FQFA|4.0|Yes folks SCI-FI (Now SyFy, the wrasslin' and Ghost Story network) doesn't have to pay as much money to the actors because they never reached 100 episodes. At 100 you get a check as long as it's in syndication, so let's screw the little guys (Flanagan, Hewlitt, Mamoa, etc.) out of every penny we can. That's how they roll.    After being a little slow in Season 3 and picking up in Four, Season Five showed promise. The \\"Evil\\" Asgard and the attacking aliens from \\"Daedalus Variations\\" offered 2 possible new story arcs. But wait, we can't let any actors share in the success, cancel the show so we can get more money for ourselves! Thanks NBC/Universal!!    I bought this one used on Amazon to deny the rights' owners any new income. MGM's financial cratering and sale of all props and wardrobes pretty well assure that NO future pick ups of Stargate Atlantis and Universe will happen in the foreseeable future so enjoy Season 5, it's all that's left!

B005IDXIL2|5.0|From reading reviews of other bowling apps, I have been reluctant to bother even giving them a chance.  What seemed to be the critical errors in other bowling apps: ball control/curve, pin action and bloat do not seem to be characteristic problems in this app. In fact, it offers curve/hook and good simulation of pin action.  I would guess that the paid app may offer even more control.  So if you have time to SPARE...try it.
B0067H9W72|5.0|Seriously, his character is one of the best developed characters i could imagine for this scenario. Anyway, I have mostly been DVRing this, and so i didnt buy this here, but i did think it was pretty awesome. The development of Darryl is my favorite aspect of this season so far to be sure. So, I'll keep this brief, but with spoilers, so look away, lol<br /><br />When Darryl starts hallucinating, and his brother Merle is giving him flak while basically motivating him to get up and survive (D's subconscious speaking), i knew a zombie would be preparing to gnaw on him...and he was brutally efficient in handling that situation.<br />Also, all the zombies being kept in the barnhouse....figured that out before it happened, but it still added an element of shock to the series, much like Shane sacrificing Otis in a previous episode. Makes you stop and think about how things would really be in a zombie filled world, and how morality is subjective when the perceived extinction of mankind is eminently possible.<br /><br />I haven't read the comics yet, but i did buy the first omnibus recently, and from what i understand, the series has been true to the comics, making me even more certain to read them soon, and quickly.<br /><br />Enjoy!

B005UG542S|5.0|This is for the rental btw.<br /><br />I really liked this final installment in the Harry Potter series. It has been a lengthy road, but seeing it to the end felt rewarding somehow. I felt that the previous installment was actually the weakest of the movies, and was hoping this would be a solid conclusion. For me, it worked perfectly. That's not to say there weren't some flaws in the filming...there were. Some of the battles were kind of hard to follow visually, and the very, very end was a little difficult. I feel they should have done a little better with the make-up, or gotten a different lot of actors for the last two or three minutes. That aside, it was kind of back to Potter basics. A continuation of the theme with a quest at hand, a discovery of unheralded bravery, disclosure of the finer plot details, and a final confrontation, with some surrealist moments mixed in to change the pace and further the plot.<br />I see this movie wasnt well received in the reviews here, but i enjoyed the movie and thought it was an almost perfect closure of the series. Of course, i haven't read the books, so i cant speak to the authenticity of the story line per se, but for a person who hasnt read them, i was impressed.<br />Enjoy!
B004AHNIGM|5.0|As truly remarkable as this album is in its own right -- and no mistake, it is -- Gregg Allman also accomplishes something as important as the music he makes on Low Country Blues.  For many who came of age in the middle '60s, our introduction to one of America's original art forms -- the blues -- came via \\"British Invasion\\" rock-n-roll: the remakes of classic American blues by the Stones, John Mayall, the Yardbirds, Clapton, etc.  That strategy was adopted by our own talent -- Paul Butterfield early on and then many others by the end of the '60s, notably of course the Allman Brothers.    The blues by both its black creators and white accolytes has found its way down to the present, still vital in the hands of B.B. and Buddy at one end, a host of fine players at the other.      But what Gregg Allman has done is return to the music's roots and assumed the legacy promised by the Allmans' early music, a full circle from Sleepy John, Skip James, Muddy, Otis, B.B., Sam Maghett, and all the trad blues he has included on Low Country.  The Stones for sure but most of the other Brits as well have headed off into whatever it's called they're playing now -- with occasional nods to them ol' blues.  But the music's back in the hands of American practitioners for the most part, and as the old bluesmen pass on, Gregg Allman has stepped to the forefront with this album.  The man has the chops, the ear, the sympatico side players, the producer, the history, and the right to sing the blues.  He does and it works.   Listen to the early Allman Brother blues and then listen to this excellent effort from Allman and producer T Bone Burnett.  The line from the old bluesmen through the Allmans to this album is unmistakable, and the music at once classic and reverential while also innovative and fresh.  The music that was borrowed and resold to us has been reclaimed here by its proper descendants and rightful heirs.  This is American music, this is Americana, this is damn fine music played byhot players, produced by a working genius, and led by the man who growled his introduction into the mic on \\"It's Not My Cross To Bear\\" 40-some years ago.  Get it.  Celebrate it.  This is the blues.

0307272702|1.0|Following this book's advice will kill you. Eating high-omega-6 grain-fed inflammatory meat will give you heart disease and cancer. Just read AntiCancer and The China Study, written by real scientists. Meat has a high content of Omega-6: inflammatory fatty acids. Inflammation creates positive environment for heart disease and cancer. Grass-fed beef has less omega-6 and more anti-inflammatory omega-3, but the balance still tips toward the omega-6. Fruits and vegetables, on the other hand, protect you from heart disease and cancer. They are anti-inflammatory and contain tons of healthy nutrients. The scientific research confirming that, and tons of it, is excellently described in AntiCancer and The China Study. Excluding fruits and vegetables from the diet and substituting it with inflammatory meat will kill you. Please don't follow Taubes' advice. Please read AntiCancer and The China Study first. Please, I don't want you to die before your time.   Obesity epidemic is recent and is mostly the Western phenomenon. There are billions of people in the world who are skinny and who follow a mostly-carb diet: Chinese, Japanese, French, etc. These cultures eat some meat, but not predominantly meat, because meat is expensive. They eat a little meat (except some areas in China, which are vegetarian) and mostly carbs. And yet, they are skinny. I won't pretend to be a weight-loss expert, but this evidence suggests that there are other ways to stay healthy than eating only meat.   Eating lots of meat is not sustainable to our planet. To get 100 calories of beef we have to feed the cow 700 calories worth of vegetables. That is simply not sustainable. Producing beef screws up our land use and generates green-house gases, because cows produce methane and because we destroy forests to create pastures for cows. So eating lots of meat will not only kill you, but also the Earth of which we live.   Please think hard and read other books written by scientists before taking this advice.

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|I'll admit that when I bought this album I wasn't very knowledgeable about Lou Reed and what he's done, other than he was in Velvet Underground and hasn't done much other than concept albums since. Being beaten up for defending Load, Reload, and St. Anger as artistic exploration and maturing, I simply can't do the same for this album. It's utter garbage, and I say that because I can't use stronger language in an Amazon review. Lou Reed mangles each and every song with his atrocious vocals, and most of it isn't even singing but spoken word. There are, in a few songs, fleeting moments where Metallica's power and rhythm shines through, but then Lou opens his mouth, and the moment is ruined. You find yourself wishing Metallica had saved some of the riffs from this album for a real Metallica project, but there truly isn't one redeeming song on this entire album. To top it all off, Reed himself admitted that he has no fans, and hasn't for some time, and that he doesn't care. Well, this album proves it. The entire album has the artsy-nuveau feel to it and will only be loved by those who go to art exhibits to see someone who has peed on a canvas and signed it. It's heartbreaking to have Metallica's name on an utter disaster like this album, and one would truly hope that they will be coming out with something along the lines of Death Magnetic. It already has a ready-to-go name...Metallica: The Apology.

0374275637|5.0|Back in 1994, Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini, Director of the Institute of San Raffaele in Milan, Italy, wrote a charming little book about common cognitive distortions called Inevitable Illusions. It is probably the very first comprehensive summary of behavioral economics intended for general audience. In it, he predicted that the two psychologists behind behavioral economics - Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman - would win the Nobel prize. I didn't disagree with the sentiment, but wondered how in the world were they going to get it since these two were psychologists and there is no Nobel prize in psychology. I didn't think there was much chance of them winning the Nobel Prize in economics. I was wrong and Piattelli-Palmarini was right. Kahneman won the Nobel prize in Economic Sciences. (Tversky unfortunately prematurely passed away by this time.) Just as Steve Jobs who was not in the music industry revolutionized it, the non-economists Kahneman and Tversky have revolutionized economic thinking. I have known Kahneman's work for quite some time and was quite excited to see that he was coming out with a non-technical version of his research. My expectations for the book were high and I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Since other reviewers have given an excellent summary of the book, I will be brief in my summary but review the book more broadly.<br /><br />The basis thesis of the book is simple. In judging the world around us, we use two mental systems: Fast and Slow.  The Fast system (System 1) is mostly unconscious and makes snap judgments based on our past experiences and emotions. When we use this system we are as likely to be wrong as right. The Slow system (System 2) is rational, conscious and slow. They work together to provide us a view of the world around us.<br /><br />So what's the problem? They are incompatible, that's what.<br /><br />System 1 is fast, but easily swayed by emotions and can be as easily be wrong as be right. You buy more cans of soup when the display says \\"Limit 12 per customer\\".  We are on autopilot with this system. System 1 controls an amazing array of behavior. System 2 is conscious, rational and careful but painfully slow. It's distracted and hard to engage. These two systems together provide a backdrop for our cognitive biases and achievements.<br /><br />This very well written book will enlighten and entertain the reader, especially if the reader is not exposed to the full range of research relating to behavioral economics.<br /><br />This book serves an antidote to Malcolm Gladwell's Blink. Although Gladwell never says that snap judgments are infallible and cannot badly mislead us, many readers got a different message. As the Royal Statistical Society's Significance magazine put it \\"Although Gladwell's chronicle of cognition shows how quick thinking can lead us both astray and aright, for many readers Blink has become a hymn to the hunch.\\" While Kahneman does show how \\"fast thinking\\" can lead to sound judgments, he also notes how they can lead us astray. This point is made much more clearly and deliberately in Kahneman's book<br /><br />All my admiration for the brilliance and creativity of Kahneman (and Tversky) does not mean that I accept 100% of their thesis. Consider this oft-quoted study. Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. As a student, she was deeply concerned with the issues of discrimination and social justice, and she also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations. Which is more probable?<br />1. Linda is a bank teller.<br />2. Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.<br />Eighty-five percent of test subjects chose the second option, that Linda was a bank teller and active in the feminist movement. Kahneman's interpretation is that this opinion is wrong because the probability of a (random) woman being a bank teller is greater that than person's being a bank teller AND a feminist. What Kahneman overlooks here is that what most people answered may not be the question that was asked. The respondents may not have been concerned with mathematical probabilities, but rather could be responding to the question in reverse: Is it more likely for a current activist to have been an activist in the past compared to others in the profession? A more formal and theoretically better argued rebuttal of some of Kahneman's hypotheses can be found in the works of Gerd Gigerenzer.<br /><br />Kahneman notes that even top performers in business and sports tend to revert to the mean in the long run. As a result, he attributes success largely to luck. I'm not so convinced of this. There can be alternative explanations. People who achieve high degree of success are also exposed to a high degree of failure and the reversion to the mean may be attributable to this possible mirror effect. Spectacular success may go with spectacular failure and run-of-the-mill success may go with run-of-the-mill failure. Eventually everyone may revert the mean, but the ride can be very different. Chance may not account for that.<br /><br />Another concern is that much of the work is done in artificial settings (read college students). While much of what we learnt can perhaps be extended to the real world, it is doubtful every generalization will work in practice. Some may find Kahneman's endorsement of \\"libertarian paternelism,\\" not acceptable. More importantly, when applied to the real world it did not always found to work.<br /><br />In spite to these comments this book is written carefully in a rather humble tone. I also appreciated Kahneman's generous and unreserved acknowledgement of Tversky's contributions and his conviction that, had he been alive, Tversky would have been the co-recipient of the Nobel Prize. My cautionary comments probably have more to do with the distortions that might arise by those who uncritically generalize the findings to contexts for which they may not applicable. As mentioned earlier, the wide misinterpretation of Gladwell's Blink comes to mind.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Thinking Fast and Slow is a very valuable book by one of the most creative minds in psychology.  Highly recommended. For a more complete and critical understanding, I also recommend the writings of the critics of behavioral economic models such as Gerd Gigerenzer.<br /><br />PS. After I published this review, I noticed an odd coincidence between Thinking Fast and Slow and Inevitable Illusions that I mentioned in my opening paragraph. Both books have white covers, with an image of a sharpened yellow pencil with an eraser top. How odd is that?ed may not be the question that was asked.

1451648537|5.0|Finished Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs. I used to run past his house on long 20 mile workouts from Mountain View to Stanford. It wasn't lavish.  A sad final visit from Bill Gates in his terminal cancer. Gates envious for Jobs up to the end was still actively running Apple.  For better or worse, Jobs' aesthetic informs my 13 PowerBook. The DVD reader is a slot rather than a popout tray, famously referred to as a cup-holder after early PC users used it for that purpose. This is because Steve hated popout trays. It means there's no way to aggressively eject a disk: you must restart and hold down the touchpad.  There are only two USB ports and they are so close together you cannot insert a \\"dongle\\" with extra electronics for accessing the Web, and another USB. You have to attach a hub. I have two which were given away free with HP mouses but they are unreliable, and clumsy for portable use, being wire attached.  The 13 PowerBook is a bit heavy owing to the anodized aluminium case which has perhaps caused my back trouble this month. Should have gotten the Air with a separate DVD drive left at home.  Jobs said, I will design the future, and you will live in it.  But there was an element of superficiality in his Baby Boomer modernism. For him, \\"Picasso\\" was an icon, whereas reading John Berger (The Success and Failure of Picasso) and Francois Gilot (Life with Picasso) reveals a far more complex figure who reconciled with the rich and with tradition in the 1920s, being untrue to the hard cubism of Georges Braque, and stealing from Braque as well.  Baby Boomers think they know Modernism in Prokofiev, Picasso and Gershwin and do not realize that in the 1920s, these and other modernists made it easy for the bourgeois to like whilst Schoenberg, Braque and Adorno insisted on a harder path. Thus they only SAY \\"think different\\" while in the real company, real difference is \\"disruptive\\".  Jobs returned computer Modernism to tonality whereas for Wozniak and me, the very appeal was its atonal programmability and openness, an openness that made computing accessible only to people smart enough to understand software.  Now, in one of those paradoxes (those dialectical paradoxes), the Woz openness approach is at one and the same time \\"elitist\\" as is the Jobs closed approach.  Woz opened the backplane of the Apple II for slots over Jobs' objections even as I, as a Cobol programmer supporting babies before I escaped to the Valley, labored to provide mini-languages as parameters for my code rather than \\"sit down\\" with the \\"end user\\" and \\"decide\\" what \\"was wanted\\" (in the language of business that I found so false and dreary). I wanted to serve the end user, but I wanted very little to do with actual Human Resources and Payroll managers since I thought them bourgeois and boring. Likewise, Adorno wanted to teach how to recognize sonata form so that the music listener would be able to listen to a new sonata and follow the form, whereas his manager and that clown Deems Taylor (who appears as the emcee of the first Fantasia movie from Disney) wanted listeners only to recognize the themes of \\"important\\" works.  Were we \\"elitist\\"? I'd say the real elitists were the people who got much more rich than Woz by deciding what the 99% wanted and stealing from Xerox PARC. Likewise, Adorno was an \\"elitist\\" whose typists understood his writings better than David Sarnoff, the CEO of RCA.  We got it, Woz and I. Instead of deciding arrogantly what \\"people\\" wanted in a generalization, we designed languages for \\"people\\" to get what they wanted in a fundamental computing gesture. I was bored at Roosevelt University with having to write the same assembler program over and over again for a large class of jobs so I designed a program to operate within 8K that would accept the user's specification of logic and format.  But: as my boss at Princeton emphasized, so many people live damaged lives that they are not interested in open interfaces. For her, our constituent was in the abstract the alienated and stressed graduate student who really hates Milton now because \\"Milton\\" names her pain, who cannot print her dissertation on time. My boss conceded that part of my job was in-depth (she in fact had me fix an assembler program very similar to my Roosevelt code and work for John Nash) but we also had to support damaged existence.  And despite the Reverse Polish elegance of Postscript I too get enraged at the lack of progress information from my printer when I'm in a rush. But Steve Jobs, I think, doesn't want his hardware and software to give me progress reports. His thinking would instead be that the printing would be FAST.  Woz and I were Adorno at the Radio Research project: Adorno wanted to teach about real music but his handlers wanted him to justify idiot \\"music appreciation\\".  Jobs never faced up to the fact that our artifacts have to adjust as we do to damaged existence.  Jobs was part of the 1% who can go and buy an Air when the PowerBook throws their back out. In 1981, a San Mateo County court directed him, according to Isaacson, to pay his former girlfriend Chrisann Brennan 345.00 a month to support Lisa whose paternity he tried at first to deny. A few months later a Chicago court directed me to pay 1000.00 for two kids on a 40K/year salary in Silicon Valley. Jobs was already quite well-off in early 1981 when the San Mateo award was made, and concealed from the court the planned IPO of Apple which later that year made Jobs a millionaire.  I paid the award, of course. And during a later spell of unemployment I was very proud of my kid Peter when he got on the phone and said, \\"hey when you gettin' a job so you can give our Mom da munny she needs for us?\\" I calmly told him of the steps I was taking, the resume writing and the interviews and this he seemed to understand. I respected his feisty willingness to confront me. He did very well in school and became a successful entrepreneur. As his Grandma would say, he is good.My other kid developed an innovative game for the Mac at the age of 12. I noticed that he lovingly documented it in clear and very literate English and credited me for giving the computer. But they ignored him at his school and laughed at him when he asked to be admitted to the honors program; in helping to clean his room later on I found demeaning comments scrawled on his papers by teachers when those papers were in fact ten times more literate than the average because like me my elder son is a natural rebel. As his Grandma would say, he is good.  When the first Mac came out overpriced at 2400.00 I bought one and my kids, during their frequent and expensive trips to California, really liked it. But it was all such a fragile illusion, \\"all this useless beauty\\" since it had so many preconditions.  Late in life Jobs complained to Obama that it was cheaper to open a factory in China than in the USA, which sounds dubious due to the opacity of working and doing business in Mainland China that I've experienced first hand. He also said that teachers' unions be destroyed.  Jobs is said to represent \\"the spirit of the Sixties\\". He's more early Seventies, and from the time of the Beatles' White Album, not Sgt Pepper. This was a time during which the Left which had been multicultural, urban and intergender, became a sort of white male myth in which dominant white males would be \\"Uncle John\\" and counsel the Rest of Us by the riverside.  I'm not saying Steve or Apple was a racist or a racist company: it was and is not. I am saying that \\"designing the future\\" is not just art and technology. It also tells us how to live. Steve's favorite color was white but I liked black (the IBM 370 mainframe, announced around 1970, was black).  Open computing encourages diversity whereas Apple was a sort of creepy Heideggerian \\"Gathering\\" in which Steve defined Being.  I can see where my desire for a DVD tray and progress reports are based on my experience with unreliable PC hardware; if the system works faster and more reliably these are unnecessary. But, we cannot design in 100% reliability.  We in the 99% don't \\"take\\" meetings with Steve. Instead, our own managers come to us and warn us not to \\"offend\\" Steve by departing from his articles of faith, and since we're meeting that child support obligations we dare not talk back, or ask for a meeting with Jobs...who was willing to be swayed by good arguments.  Ideally I should have started my own firm but this runs up against a fundamental truth. Despite the fact that I was very good with programming, having grokked Turing's science BEFORE my first computer science class, I wanted to be in the humanities (art, dance, writing, theater) and allowed myself to be counseled to be \\"practical\\", not only by my parents but also by my friends, who were all sellouts and party animals.  Like Steve's sister Mona Simpson, in the Valley, I wanted to be \\"anywhere but here\\". And the first time I tried to draw with the mouse, I realized, whoa, this platform has a LONG way to go. While today I can buy great pen-digitizers primarily aimed at Chinese people who want to write their calligraphy, Steve never thought about what an effective brush-stylus might be since he hated the stylus. But I don't want to paint with fingers: that's childish.  Apple is for me like an old and totally psycho girlfriend: in the 1980s at Princeton I had Apple on my desk and was really into Hypercard. But then in 1990, Bill Atkinson told me at a conference that Hypercard would have color \\"when he felt like it\\": Steve and Bill were I think into the elegance of monochrome. So, when Visual Basic 3.0 came out it was like crack cocaine for me. I got totally into it, and recapitulated my early days with the IBM 1401 (caffeine, cigarettes, alcohol to relax) but in my 40s with the result that my life was a mess.  But today I've gotten back with my old and psycho girlfriend in the form of my Powerbook.  Rest in Peace, Steve. Thank you. But...grace and virtue must never be stupidity, and when you said, \\"great artists steal\\", that's what they were.
B005I6EU7U|1.0|\\"Made for Kindle Fire\\" must mean something different to the folks at Amazon. This is a generic Verso case that \\"fits\\" the Fire, in that it almost does. It's a beautiful case, and I really wish it would have worked. The Verso case has a small magnet that is supposed to keep the top cover closed, but unfortunately, the only thing it has ever attached to is the packaging insert.   Pros:  -Beautiful case  Cons:  -Barely fits the Fire, front does not lay flat without holding it down due to size mismatch  -Magnet intended to hold down the front has nothing to attach to due to this cover being a generic design  -Elastic keepers go over the Fire's speakers in either orientation  One star, because there is no option for zero.
B000HT2P9S|5.0|This was one of the best pieces of writing that I've come across in a while. I loved it while reading it, and I still think about it from time to time. I even learned a thing or two. The theme between new and old is a bit cliche, perhaps, but the story line, the character development, the plot twists, and the ending are all unique. This is one you should read.
B004EPZ070|5.0|First off let me say I did not know this movie was adapted from a book!!  Duh on me I guess.... I absolutely LOVED this movie!!  The main characters of Rachel and Dex had great chemistry which makes the movie work.  I didn't hate Darcy...I actually liked her.  But it was SOOOO easy to see that she was so into herself, that missed what was right before her eyes.  I recommended the movie to several friends and they loved it as well!  I thought about reading the book...but I don't want to change my perception of this movie!!  Great Job!!!

B005TOW9JM|1.0|No matter what sounds you use (and Justice has their own sound), disco is still disco. If I wanted to hear disco, I would pull out my old Bee Gees albums and listen to the original and best disco ever recorded.

B005GP7F8Y|4.0|The Amazon editorial review stating \\"Pain-staking re-mastering and re-colorized\\" is a stretch. And I suppose they meant Painstakingly re-mastered and re-colorized. When I first viewed this BD I thought I was watching a colorized version of a 50's Audie Murphy western. The picture had exceptionally low color and contrast levels like I've never seen on a blu-ray. I tweeked my Panasonic 50-inch Plasma TV picture settings, +30 for added contrast, Color +8, Tint -8 (toward red), Brightness -2, and Sharpness +17. You can also select Vivid if that's available on your TV.  With the picture adjustments made, no DVD can compare with the OEJ blu-ray. You will be disappointed initially on seeing the shivering credits roll past a gray brick wall along with some artifacts. Minutes later, in the first bank robbery scene, Brando is sitting atop the bank counter - in pathetic VHS quality. Somehow these opening frames were not upgraded. From then on, the picture is improved as can be seen from the details in  the clothing, horses, and saddles. It's not perfect but is probably close to 1080p in resolution.   Throughout the film there's a slight, grainy quality to the picture especially in some of the low light scenes. Also I found a voice sync problem noticeable in the beach scenes with Rio and Louisa. They could have done a much better job with this blu-ray but for 13 bucks, I'll keep it.  What makes this western so good is the emotional intensity of Brando, whether humorously conning a woman, \\"My mother gave me this before she died\\", or in a vicious fit of anger \\"Get up, you scum sucking pig. I'm gonna open you up.\\" Karl Malden as the treacherous Dad Longworth and Ben Johnson as outlaw Bob Amory provide strong supporting performances as do the rest of the cast.   Odd things about this BD: The opening copyright details are in German. The credit titles are in French. You can select German or English for the audio but after the movie plays, I had to restart the disc to change the language. The trailer appears to be a combination of stop-action scenes from the movie and part of the original trailer. No special features. Four stars because I like the movie despite the disappointing blu-ray effort.

0553381695|5.0|There is a sense of realism in this book that wasn't there in the first one. The land seems more vibrant and genuine. The characters emotions and realizations of the troubles is the best I've ever read. Most \\"fantasy\\" books now are written to entertain younger audiences but this is way beyond that. This ties back to the overall realism in the story. If this was a children's novel, your main hero and heroines would always be triumphant and live through everything no matter what they face. Not with Martin's fantasy. You never know what is going to become of the characters. Through one book, a character can change from your favorite to your hated, and Martin does it in the most subtle ways in which you don't even realize you've changed view. Martin does a great job in putting emotion into all of the characters. You know their pain as they experience it, and you can't help but feels that it's yourself that is getting hurt as it happens. This book also is a literal title for what happens, the world expands. You get a larger sense of what these kings and kingdoms are battling over. In the first book you have the main houses, Stark and Lannister, battling over pride. In a Clash of Kings, you see Stark and Lannister aren't the only ones looking to prove their power anymore. This book gives you a constant suspense and suspicion of what is going to happen next, because with Martin, you can never guess it.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|What is happening to digital copies.  Ultraviolet sucks.  I enjoyed the movie but want the digital copy in my iTunes library, not on some website where they can cut off access anytime they like, and if you download the movie you can still not put it in your iTunes.  This is terrible.

I do not want my digital copy on a website that can be removed at will, or downloaded to my computer but not in my iTunes account.  I want normal digital copies that I can put in iTunes and sync with my iPad for viewing where and when I want, not just when I am under WiFi coverage.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|I pre-ordered the case along with my Fire.  It's okay, but not great.  It protects the Kindle pretty well, but the cover feels a bit flimsy.  The stand-up feature doesn't work all that well.  The angles aren't great and it's a little wobbly.  The felt backing of the cover likes to pick up crumbs and dirt if you use it flipped open and flat on a table.  That stuff then gets on your screen when you close it.  Glad Amazon dropped the price on it.

B0058VA2U4|5.0|To start I'll say I have always been a casual fan of Anthrax, especially with their early works. That said, Worship Music is a hard, fast, and aggressive masterpiece! It seems to be a rather mature offering with more precise musicianship, less frivolity (...I drink 3 sixpacks just so I can look at your face...) and a hard edge. They definitely seem to have been focused in the making of this album and Joey sounds better than ever. The highlights (if I had to pick just a few) are definitely: The Devil You Know, Fight 'Em Til You Can't, I'm Alive, In The End and The Giant. Not to say that the other songs are poor - far from it - but the aforementioned tracks are tops in my book. I'm really impressed, as are a few friends who were never fans of Anthrax. They agree that this album rocks! Highly recommended - great job guys! The only disappointment is that the band does not appear to be visiting the Cincinnati area on their tour :(
B005C7SXMS|5.0|At first viewing, you might think SUBMARINE is a film produced for teenagers going thru COMING OF AGE problems, ie first serious relationship, changing relationships with parents, being harassed by school chums, etc. However, NOBODY really has a youth like this. The film's characters and their situations are idealized, exaggerated stereotypes. SUBMARINE centers around Young Oliver, and his problems stemming from his self absorbed, self reflective philosophizing of his life. Oliver's EYE is the film itself, a film that cleverly shows Oliver agonizing over relationships, family and depression. His self reflective, artistic world is revealed thru the device of films within films. Oliver is constantly OBSERVING his world, filming with his eyes, just as we are observing him as the movie viewer. For example, you have the \\"student film\\" scene of the two young lovers running on the beach, filmed in super 8 style, all shakey, overexposed, etc. Various dreams and daydreams work as film within film as well. His girlfriend intuitively understands and promotes the process, forcing Oliver to take polaroids of their FIRST KISS, and record it immediately into his diary. Almost NOTHING happens in the film without Oliver being in, or being shown observing the scene. If you enjoy a movie that's a \\"Visualized Confessional Diary\\", employing symbolism, both blatant and subtle, then you're sure to enjoy this movie. Its not as surreal as some films of this genre become (SCOTT PILGRIM VS THE WORLD comes to mind), but there's enough creativity with the cinematic motifs, to keep the age old theme of FIRST LOVE fresh.<br /><br />The film is called SUBMARINE for a good reason...everybody in the film is sinking into their own inner ocean of depression at some point. The main characters, and their setting, are all strongly connected to the ocean. From the father's job as oceanographer, the huge fish tank in Oliver's house dominating the domestic scenes, the shots of Oliver with and without his girlfriend contemplating the ocean while depressed, the daydreams of drowning, Oliver's slow movement into the ocean at the film's end, and the constant reminder that the ocean is \\"6 miles deep\\", the symbol of the OCEAN is the motor driving the film's plot. Each of the characters are in a SUBMARINE, six miles deep, and disconnected from each other. Getting OUT of their submarines, and discovering healthy human relationships, is the GOAL of the characters. As the true antagonist, the ocean represents the self-indulgent, over-emotional qualities of a teenager (or adults acting out their teenage dreams). If you took the symbolism out of the film, it would be a rather ordinary, boring look at two teenagers in crisis, and their families. What makes this film cool, is this intricate, intriguing use of symbolism, from the point of view of OLIVER as a young artist both sinking into, and floating upon, the Ocean of feelings he struggles with thruout the film. SUBMARINE will take you someplace deep, if you're willing to take the trip.ontemplating the ocean while depressed, the daydreams of drowning, Oliver's slow movement into the ocean at the film's end, and the constant reminder that the ocean is \\"6 miles deep\\", the symbol of the OCEAN is the motor driving the film's plot.

Tip - use HANDBRAKE for your digital copy;)
0375703764|5.0|House of Leaves had a profound impact on me, and if in the end I make something out of myself as a writer, I will have it to thank (or blame, depending on your perspective).  Maybe that sounds like an overstatement to you.  Hyperbole, perhaps.  And in truth, it is.  Because that is all you can get from a review of House of Leaves.  No one reads Mark Z. Danielewski's book and comes away lukewarm.  They either love it or hate it.  Or to be more precise, they do both.<br /><br />When my best friend showed up at my house with a copy of House of Leaves, she presented the good-sized tome as a gift.  \\"It's a book about a house that's bigger on the inside than the outside,\\" she said with a smile.  Such a simple description.  A pretty accurate one too, if you want a plot summary.  But House of Leaves is so much more.  It is a mystery and a psychological study and a horror novel and a puzzle box, all wrapped into one.  It is the Lemarchand Box from The Hellbound Heart and H.P. Lovecrafts's Necronomicon.  It is a gift, and it is a curse, for rest assured--there will be times when you will want to quit this book.  When you will want to throw it across the room and never pick it up again.  But you will.  You will because you want to know.  Because you are just as curious as Johnny Truant and Will Navidson, and because you know that until you finish, the strange dreams that the book brings will not end...<br /><br />Now, I don't expect that this review has made much sense to you.  Don't worry, House of Leaves won't either.  Which brings me to how the book affected me.  I hated House of Leaves, in a way at least.  I hated it so much that I decided to write a book that was as completely different from House of Leaves as I could make it.  One that reflected the older traditions of horror writing, free from the post-modern insanity contained within the pages of Danielewski's dark masterpiece.  In its opening pages, my book, That Which Should Not Be, is dedicated to those who made it possible.  In a strange way, Mark Z. Danielewski is at the top of that list.<br /><br />Why then, you ask, do I find myself recommending House of Leaves to every friend who asks for a good book to read?  Because I love it too, and in its twisted and unexplainable pages I find something truly magical.  House of Leaves cannot be explained.  It cannot be synopsized.  It can only be experienced.strange way, Mark Z. Danielewski is at the top of that list.

B00364K6YW|5.0|I have read and studied the novel for years and enjoyed the accuracy of this version. The Joe Wright version with Kiera Knightley is entertaining and made to fit in a 2 hour time slot. Characters were left out; scenes were compressed into one; lines were given to different characters but it is still enjoyable to me. This \\"Colin Firth\\" version is much more truer to the text; therefore taking six hours, instead of two. My only complaint is the casting. Jane is supposedly the prettiest of the Bennett girls. In this version, she is not. Rosemund Pike should have had Jane's part in this, as well.
B000001ELP|3.0|This is Kiss attempt at being a serious group like Rush or Queen and we get a good tease of what could have been on this cd. If you are a fan of progressive/heavy/rock/metal than you will probably enjoy this whole album or find something to love. It is probably one of my favorite Kiss albums(im not a big fan of the band but they are ok). I have polygram version with all the songs out of order. The remastered version of the album makes more sense in the original song order with \\"Fan fare\\" 1st, \\"the oath\\" as track 8 instead of 1, and \\"I\\" last. But if you want superior sound quality get the old Polygram records release like I did. On the polygram release, \\"the Oath\\" is played first instead of being track 8, and as a concept album this will make less sense to the story but it sounds as warm as a vinyl. I would recommend all non remastered releases of any album by any band over the remasters.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|wheres the update? its updated on the marketplace but not here.. no extra levels to speak of. i have to write stuff in order to post amything. great game though
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I actually really like this case and am surprised by negative reviews. My only complaint is price, as I think it's a bit overpriced. But in the end I got $10 back when they reduced it and I've got a case that I believe is durable and will last as long as I need it. The case is ultra minimal, and adds virtually no weight. It looks simple, but sharp and professional. The felt back of the cover actually cleans off the screen when closed so that when you open you have a fresher screen.  All in all I'm very happy with this case.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|The music for this movie is wonderful. I really like the nice blend of styles of music that where incorporated into it. I am looking forward to seeing how well it plays into the movie.
B005DOL0R0|3.0|I'm not disappointed in the sleeve itself, just the fact that it cost $29.99 when it seems like it should go for half that.  That being said, I do like the look (I have the charcoal sleeve) and how it fits my Fire.  I prefer a sleeve over a folio style case simply because I like to hold the Fire without anything on it when in use, but want to make sure it is safe when being transported. (Note:  I currently have a Marware Eco-Vue case for my K3 and LOVE it.  Marware does make an Eco-Vue for the Fire, so you might look into that if you prefer a case over a sleeve).  The protection the zip sleeve offers is minimal, but it should be fine for the average user who will store the tablet in a bag or purse when on the go.  As for the smell that some people have mentioned, it definitely does exist.  It's not that bad, however, and will go away with time.  Overall, I'm happy with the sleeve just not what I paid for it.  This might be the best sleeve available right now, however, as there aren't many other options out there.
0307891402|4.0|First things first. I received my strategy guide on time and in great condition. The book is amazing and I recommend it to everyone except there is one problem. My roommate and I both ordered one on his account and got them both wrapped up together. The problem is I went to check the dark brotherhood quests in the book and guess what? I'm missing pages 225 to 256. This is unacceptable. My roommates book came with all the pages but not mine. I was able to contact prima games and they sent me a new one free of charge and their customer service was great. When you get your book make sure to check that it has all the pages .

0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire is the second of Suzanne Collins' trilogy and what a great read it is. This book was just as hard to put down as the first one. Surprises abound in the lives of Katniss and Peeta and all the other characters in this book. Who's going to win? Who's going to die? What happens next? It's a page turner for sure!
B005IGVYUG|4.0|The only new thing from Tom Waits on this album is him dropping the F-bomb on \\"Hell Broke Luce\\". Otherwise it is a revisit of all his past works, but very, very well executed. Listen to his complete works and you will hear every song on this album spread across his other 20. That being said, this is an album I will sit down and enjoy. But contrary to past reviewers, I don't think it rates a five. A five would be a solo trip to the junkyard with him on a saturday afternoon. I feel like I'm being told and re-told the story of when he went junkyarding with someone else between 1982 and 1992. Also, if you as a reviewer coyly disclosed that Keith Richards played guitar on this album, BFD.  It's a matter of record, no need to gussy up your own opinion of the album by that. I also don't need to know what you had for breakfast before listening to this album. Get some perspective, people.  Tom Waits is a treasure in modern american music and this album is one of his greatest, but then again most of them are.
B001I0T92Q|4.0|This adapter works great on PSP. I have two ADATA 8GB microSDHC in this adapter. It shows 14GB on my PSP after format.  One thing to notice is that this adapter is thicker than normal Memory stick pro duo. Do not use it in PSP-1000. You will not be able to remove it without tools. I mainly use it in my PSP-2000.
0385534639|3.0|I loved her vivid descriptions of the circus and the magical happenings.  But about halfway through, I just lost interest and it was a chore to finish it.  As others have said, there were too many puzzling mysteries that weren't explained (or explained too late, which was frustrating).  I never understood the death of the minor female character who gets hit by the train.  And I just thought the ending was sort of anti-climactic.  It will indeed make a great film -- the ideal use of CGI!
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Solid title. Great way to spend a few minutes or a few hours.  If it were updated to properly support a tablet, it would earn all five stars.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|This artist rapidly become one of my favorites.  His music is classic and refined recorded with a live orchestra without the manufactured sound.  This Christmas recording will be around for generations to enjoy.  This artist has only gotten better with a pure expressive voice compared to the likes of Streisand in the way he performs his songs.  The quality of this recording is well thought out and refined in the style he and the composers have chosen to do the music and well worth having in any colletion.  The quality of his voice to me surpasses many of past artists who did music of this style.  I would compare him to Perry Como more than Sinatra or Crosby.  The natural purity of his voice is one of the best I have heard to date.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I preordered this along with my Kindle Fire. When I saw the initial reviews, I tried to cancel the order (but it was too late). I received the case  yesterday and I really don't think it's as bad as the early reviews. It's serviceable, protects the Fire, and can be used as a stand in landscape mode. Pretty much what I expected. I was a tad miffed that I paid $39.99 for it and saw it yesterday for $29.99 but then got a nice note from Amazon giving me a credit for $10. Thus the additional star.
B003VANOFY|5.0|First my opinion about Logitech and their Products:   I've used Logitech products for 15+ years of which I have several that I use every day and I believe very strongly that you will be hard pressed to find another manufacture that matches Logitech's development, support and commitment to customer satisfaction. Being a computer Geek myself and having an extensive manufacturing computer system development back ground,  I've found that in most cases all new products have issues when first released due to the inability to setup a real world test environment, even when you have total control of every aspect of the product and the components that go into it. Just look at the automobile, everything should be predictable except for the operator, yet just about every automobile still have design and reliability issue(s). When you develop a product that people expect to work flawlessly and interface it with more variables than there's computers in the world, plus the operator too, is next to impossible to get it right the first time. However, in my opinion Logitech is leading the market in achieving the impossible, also after a few software/driver upgrades Logitech has done it again with the G930.  Now my opinion of the G930 headset: (keep in mind that I am NOT a Gamer or Music lover, just someone that likes convenience and quality)   My system is a Windows 7 PRO x64 on an AMD Quad Core computer. Like many other people reviewing the G930, I also had problems with the software. The software on the CD installed and ran fine for the most part but still displayed the same issues that other people have stated. When I upgrade to the latest software/drivers all the original software was uninstalled and replaced with the new upgraded software/drivers; which in my opinion is the way device/component software upgrade should be performed. In this case the new software would crash leaving me with only the system default interface; not a good feeling. I contacted Logitech support and they really could not help me because the G930 program crashed during start-up it almost had to be something in my system build causing it. Regardless, the support person tried to help and even emailed me an earlier version of the upgraded software, which also would crash on start-up. At first I thought that the ones complaining got it right, and my only option was to return the G930 because it did not live up to my expectation of a Logitech device and would not work or perform well in all computer builds. After further investigation I found that my ATI video software and drivers needed upgrading. Once I upgraded to the latest ATI video software/drivers the G930 software/drivers installed and ran flawlessly and restored my confidents in Logitech Products.  My suggestion to anyone having issue(s) with the G930 is to make sure that your system meets the minimum requirements and your software & device drivers are up to date; read all the documentation until you're familiar with the G930 headset; if you still have problems then do yourself a favor and follow the recommended clean boot troubleshooting procedures for your system before you give up and return the G930 Headset because once you get them working properly you won't be sorry.
630469654X|4.0|Good DVD;  It is rather hard to find. I gave it as a gift  and the person I got it for has enjoyed it.
B005DOL0R0|2.0|Vastly over-priced.  This item sells for $30 but is only worth maybe $5.  It seems perfectly functional just not much to it for 30.00.
0446585025|5.0|Great new book from Ellen.  In parts it is laugh out loud funny.  I really enjoyed it. Reminds me of her monologues.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|My expectations for this album were pretty high, given the quality of \\"Thank Me Later\\" plus his lyrical & song writing abilities.  I have to say that \\"Take Care\\" does not disappoint.  I knew with Drake, that I would get both Hip-Hop & R&B on one disc that felt cohesive.  I love the whole vibe of the album, really deep introspective lyrics, excellent production which seems to be tailor made to fit Drake like Skinny-jeans.  Subject matter resembles that of tracks on \\"Thank Me Later\\" but I can let that slide, given the amount of quality work that went into this album.  I'm also happy that this contains 17 tracks and not just the industry standard of 12.  Hardcore Hip-Hop fans may have a hard time swallowing this disc as it fits in between R&B and Hip-Hop...leaning a little more towards R&B if you ask me, but a thorough listen is what \\"Take Care\\" needs to be fully understood.<br /><br />Standout tracks:<br /><br />Crew Love<br />Under Ground Kings<br />Headlines<br />We'll Be Fine<br />Marvin's Room<br /><br />Honorable Mentions:<br /><br />Make Me Proud<br />HYFR<br />Shot For Me<br />Over My Dead Body
B002GHIPYI|3.0|Awful for glasses, but I hadn't had glasses long enough to have known that, so my fault. Seemed a bit tight.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|We bought this DVD for our 2-year-old daughter after we had rented it from the Redbox and she didn't want to bring it back.  I enjoy watching this DVD just as much as my daughter, and now when we read the book at bedtime, I even find myself acting out the characters.  Great, great fun!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|this was the first game I got for my kindle fire and I love it!!!! also the ads aren't bad at all 5 out of 5
B005HSG3TC|5.0|So far I really like this case - it snaps on really securely but it's not impossible to take it off for a minute (I had to check something on the back of the Kindle). The texture is really practicle and it looks nice - black is always a safe choice and it does tend to go with everything!
0802473156|5.0|Dr. Gary Chapman provides an insightful explanation of how people express their love and need for love.  Individuals' expressions of love are in the one or more of five languages, Words of Affirmation, Acts of Service, Affection, Quality Time, and Gifts.  We find that people love how they want to be loved because that's usually how they receive love.  This book points the reader to identifying what language they and their partner real needs to fill their love tank.  Dr. Chapman provides a questionnaire to help identify each individual's love languages.  Building love and fulfillment is what every individual needs, Dr.Chapman's The 5 Love Languages book is a must read book.  Read this book and start filling your partner's love tank, then reap the benefits to a more enriching relationship. This great book to give to couples and newly weds; I have given several books out myself as wedding gifts.
006207993X|5.0|I still remember the first time I read this book. It was in English 11th grade and none of us wanted to read it. But it turned out to be one of my favorites. I recently bought this new edition, new dates and all (not a big deal to me), and fell in love with it all over again. Sure, it is dated in some ways but the imagination, the storytelling, the poetic writing are masterful. Only Bradbury could momentarily briefly bring summer to the winter lands using the exhaust from rocket engines.   My favorites are And the Moon Be Still as Bright, which still makes me sad about Spender and I was startled at how violent the one scene at breakfast, and the final story The Million Year Picnic, which is sad and wonderful. But there are no weak stories in this book, not to me. It reminds me why I love to read. But it helps to have Bradbury's words. They are a joy to read.
B005VT42BS|5.0|This app is great. It can be used to quickly scan a network and see connected devices. Using it in conjunction with AndSMB makes it even better. This is probably one of my favorites.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|The Maze Runner series is an addictive read. I couldn't put the books down and purchased The Death Cure as soon as it was released. I was looking forward to a lot of my questions answered in this book but it seemed to just kinda retell a re-wrapped version of book 1 and 2. I assumed Thomas would get his memory back and all would make sense. The adventure aspect was awesome but I still have questions!
B005GP7F8Y|3.0|...waiting for a better Blu-ray or other disc version of this terrific western. The distributors/studios are rapidly losing interest in providing top quality Blu-rays of many if not most of the bigger hits, even the classics, of 50 or 60 years ago. Putting time and money into a top quality Blu-ray of a lesser 50-year old box-office draw (albeit a really fine one) like One-Eyed Jacks is way, way down on their to-do list. In fact, it isn't even on the last page of the scratch pad. They've got 3-D cartoons and comic book super-hero Blu-rays to tend to, ya' know.  Look at the shoddy work they allowed to pass into distribution of the recent West Side Story and My Fair Lady Blu-rays. Inexplicable fade-ins/fade-outs here, loss of detail on the sides of the screen there. Do you honestly think they're going to put more work into a better Blu-ray of something most of the 20-somethings sitting in on quality control never heard of called One-Eyed Jacks?  That said, the fact that this version of it is finally anamorphic widescreen and provides a bit more detail and sharpness than those bargain bin give-aways makes it worth a buy, imo. So I gave it three stars. If your player's remote has an \\"audio\\" button, that's probably the best way to select the English vs the German language. Maybe the only way, I couldn't tell.  In the face of distributors/studios looking forward to making more money on the first day's take for the Blu-ray release of Transformers 10 in 3-D than all the sales of a perfect Blu-ray of One-Eyed Jacks over the next 100 years combined, I wouldn't expect to intimidate them into producing that perfect one just because you returned this release of it to the vendor along with a surly note.  btw, Amazon says the disc includes original poster art. Well, it does. But the shots of those posters are mixed in with and comprise much of that odd trailer. They aren't a separate bonus chapter or anything like that.
B00514HDNW|5.0|Unique, well told and awesome read! I can't believe I waited so long to read Matheson's book. I have no clue why the movie with Will Smith was even called I Am Legend - nothing near the book! I wish the actual story was adapted properly to big screen.
6302938538|5.0|From freedom of the press to the concept of the Christmas tree, German culture ha made an indelible impact on the American Zeitgeist, influencing popular culture in all aspects of faily life. THE GERMAN AMERICANS reveals the unheralded history of the largest ethnic group in the United States-one in five Americans are of German ancestry-using archival film, photos, modern footage, and personal recollections from actor Eric Braeden (\\"The Young and the Restless\\"), Susan Eisenhower (granddaughter of President Dwight D. Eisenhower), Cincinnati Pops Orchestra conductor Erich Kunzel, corporate leaders, educators, scientists, and other prominent members of the community.<br /><br />Families who left the Heimatland in search of opportunity set the stage for America's early economic growth as stewards of the land, unyielding laborers, and leaders in almost every major industry. THE GERMAN AMERICANS celebrates the cultural ties that still bond generations after four hundred years in the United States in a program as richly layered as a Schumann or Beethoven composition and as uplifting as the folk music still sung by traditional Liederkranz societies.<br /><br />THE GERMAN AMERICANS also highlights German Americans who embodied the spirit of the German work ethic and philosophy and became true American icons, from President Eisenhower to Babe Ruth and Lawrence Welk to Charles Schulz.

B004ZNANZA|5.0|The Wall is an absolute classic and one of the greatest albums ever made. It's also my favorite right after Dark Side Of The Moon. There's great songwriting and an interesting story, it's a concept album and possibly the greatest rock opera of all time. It was inspired by some true events like Roger Waters' mental breakdown during the 1978 In the Flesh? Tour and Syd Barret's metal illness from LSD which he had to leave the band. There's a lot of fictional themes throughout also. If you want to understand the concept more than I'd also recommend [[ASIN:B0006ZE7G2 Pink Floyd: The Wall (25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition)]] movie. It's a much darker and more mature offering of their discography. However the music is the best part in my opinion and the album has several popular tracks throughout, like their smash-hit Another Brick In the Wall (pt 2) along with Comfortably Numb, Young Lust, Hey You, Mother and Run Like Hell. The Wall is a change in direction and it put PF back in the mainstream after people criticized '77 Animals. The songs are a bit rawer and harsher sounding but more polished than Animals and not quite as hard rock.
B004K4GDE4|5.0|Well i was hoping this would get in before my boyfriend and I's anniversary the 24th (yes thanksgiving). but it supassed my expectations and got in, in very good time very pleased with my product:))
B005D9B26E|2.0|I would have bought this set in a second if it had included a full version of the album in 5.1.  Absent that, or a live version/full concert from the period, the box set just doesn't compute.  Too bad.
B001EBYM8A|5.0|This is one of those films that is a rarity in the sense that there is an intricate plot which is largely unpredictable and yet somehow believable.  Harrison Ford does a great job as a serious character, a big change from his usual roles.  I have watched this film more than once and still enjoyed it.  A good film for those with morals of a conservative persuasion, so to speak, without being cheese-y.
B000B5MI3Q|4.0|There is honestly no question about Seiko and the way they've delivered with their watches. They definitely handle with the best of intentions, and the way the watch should be designed for the owner, as a triumph. That goes well with all of their watches, and this Seiko automatic watch is a absolute perfect example. This Seiko Men's Diver's Watch is a comfortable and convient watch that handles very well in comfort, and water resistance, over 600 feet. So you can definitely go swimming with the watch, and it will still keep on ticking with the motion of your wrist. The price and the watch is definitely right, and you'll continue to keep watching the watch for all this is worth from Seiko.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Comfort & Setup: B+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+

B005H9B2CE|4.0|This movie is funded very well and one key indicator is that the CGI is approaching 10.  The story line is a classic amalgammation of the Thor comic storylines written for the live-action screen.  The acting is acceptable for most everyone, even the actor who performed Loki, but is was a bit overdrawn.  However, this is a film about gods, hence indulgence is the order of the day.  The quaily of the costumes and the sets was impressive when in Asgard.  And shooting the \\"mortal\\" scenes in the desert provides an almost trite contrast between the two worlds.  However, the movie held my interest because it operates on a grand scale and the production team pulled it off.  Not bad.

B005HSG3TC|1.0|With such a new product (Kindle Fire), it is hard to see what is available on the market.  So, I bought this to ship with my Kindle Fire.  Forty bucks for it, I'd feel ripped off if it were four dollars.  It is like protecting a light bulb in some pantyhose.  It's cheap, flimsy, and the little stand to prop itself up is useless. It does surround the device and has a cover, but is grossly overpriced at $39.99.

B005BDZQKU|4.0|Ok, yes there is that annoying fade out at the end of the Overture but it certainly is not worth all the negative feedback.  All I know is that on my 100\\" screen and state of the art sound system, this film looks and sounds better than ever on Blu Ray.  I did not see it in its original roadshow in the fall of 1961.  I will say, however that the Intermission title is different than what was on the DVD set previously and is most likely how it appeared during its initial run.  If anyone saw this film in theaters with an Intermission, I would like to know when and where cause I never did.  There has been talk about sync problems during the musical numbers but that is also unwarranted.  I am sure they could have done a better job with this transfer, but it is what it is.  Robert Harris does mention many good things about this Blu Ray, however it is not perfect in his eyes and I respect him for that.  If anyone should know it is him.  Also, the set for $45 is not worth it.  Get the less expensive version.  The book and lobby cards and cd are a waste and not worth it.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|To see what all the fuss was about, I downloaded the trilogy to my Kindle on November 4th, 2011.  I just read the last page (11/17/2011) and for the record, my DVR is about ready to explode.  Suzanne Collins is an amazing author.  She wove an admirable story with characters you cared about and will think about for a long time to come.  No spoilers in this review for a change, just bowls upon bowls of heaping praise.  The entire trilogy was told from Katniss's POV and sometimes that's a bad thing because you don't know what's going on with other characters, but not with this series.  Ms Collins wove into the story everything we needed to know without hitting us over the head with it.  No subplot was left hanging.  Going into the last 50 pages or so I had a couple questions hanging, what happened to this person, what happened to that person, but by the end I knew exactly what had happened to everyone.  I'm still amazed at who died and how they died.  Part of the excitement was wondering if anyone was safe.  There's only one way to find out... keep turning the page.  I think what I liked best is that no one was likable all the time.  Sometimes I would stop mid-sentence and wonder what someone was thinking to make them do what they did or say what they said, but by the end, with the characters developing as they should after a war has been fought, it all made sense and came together.  A light bulb moment of understanding for the reader was realizing that people could be forgiven for their actions or lack thereof because of the hell they'd be through.  If you want to read an amazing story that's full of love, sadness, humor, excitement, and moments that are unforgettable, this is the trilogy for you.  This story was well written, well thought out, and well executed.  You can't ask for much more.  My suggestion?  Set aside a lot of time to read.  Once you start reading, you won't want to stop until you've taken in the very last wonderful morsel of the written word.

B005HSG3U6|1.0|Cheap, over-priced and the \\"fold-over-stand\\" doesn't work, my brand-new Kindle Fire just falls over on the table.  For the quality, I would have expected to pay $8-9 tops.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|One simple word: AMAZING. I'm glad hip hop is finally back. Thank you Drake. I've been a big fan since the start of Degrassi !   If you love drake, buy his CD and support him. Simple As That. Don't just leak it!
B00003CXBH|5.0|The movie was excellent and the music haunting.  We love Robert DeNiro and both he  and Jeremy Irons are great actors.  It was well worth watching. We have the movie on  VCR and wanted to get it on DVD.  We have lent the movie to our friends.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|I refuse to watch Tosh.0 after he said the Decemberist's shouldn't believe the hype. That they really suck. Every album they do takes you on a journey. The King Is Dead brings me back to the music of Gram Parsons. The feel of the roots of folk and country surround you. Give a listen to this album and enjoy. It evokes the soul of Gram Parson and Townes Van Zandt. I'm so glad to hear reflections of some of the music of my youth coming from another generation.
0307352145|4.0|I admit it - I am an introvert. I can't describe how discouraging it is to live and work in a world of extroverts, being caused to feel inferior for my \\"quietness\\". But this book helps to make it better - affirming and full of facts, affirmations and strategies to make the most of my natural state. If you're an introvert, read this to feel better about things. If you're and extrovert, read it to better understand the \\"rest\\" of us!
030788743X|5.0|This is probably my 3rd review ever for a book on Amazon but I had to write one in the hopes that more people will read this book. I don't want to hype the book too much and have it let you down. I remember  how hyped up ET was when I was growing up. Was about 13, 14 back then and ET was in the theaters for a few months and I still hadn't gone to see it but I heard the hype, saw the long lines and finally went to see it with some friends and unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype.  All I will say is this book deserves to be read if you grew up during the 80s. It brought back so many memories of the late nights in front of my C64 and the video games, computer games of yore, not to mention the tv shows and songs I listened to. It is amazing, awesome, out of this world. It's da bomb and the book is the The Man! But I don't want to hype it up too much.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Unlike several others that suggest this is a Lee Child knockoff I would beg to disagree. Certainly Lee Child cannot \\"own\\" the entire genre. Where Reacher has gone a bit stiff and predictable with often reused cliché dialogue, and action sequences, I found Puller to be a more mature and realistic character. For those that appreciate literature, Baldacci has certainly equaled if not excelled Child in this first installment with John Puller. Well worth the time, excellent plot development, fast moving and with a great ending.
B005HPA2XI|5.0|Mastodon never dissapoints, they keep evolving yet keeping their essence to make great albums each and everytime.  Very accesible to people not familiar with the band, and a great entry way for new users.
141694737X|5.0|We started reading this book with our boys at about 5 months. They've loved it every night. Eventually they started being able to open the flaps; and then they started expecting what page was coming next.  Fun for the kid, fun for the parent. You can't go wrong.
B0000DDAU9|5.0|With their first major production after their Lifesblood EP, Mastodon storms in with a powerful album that will knock you off your socks.  Definitely putting the Heavy prefix back in Metal. Step aside people, the new Metal Gods are here.
0312370849|2.0|I thought this book was very sophmoric.  It started out fascinating because it was stating facts about the Jewish Holocaust in France in 1942. The book is about weak woman. I could not help but think in every horrible event in life, people pick themselves up and go forward, you have too. It is a downer in every way.  It was a great story line but the author failed to make it interesting. I was very disappointed.  I would not reccomend this book, unless you wanted to pick it up at the library.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I bought the grey cover, and it fits my Kindle Fire like a glove.  It reminds me of my smartcover for my ipad2, but it's not magnetic and won't turn off the device.  Maybe people have higher standards because of the smartcover, but I think it looks great.  It's a sleek, lightweight case that offers protection for normal, daily use.  Maybe people think it looks cheap because of the elastic band, but I don't mind it.
B005FMZVLQ|4.0|From the moment i open up the box i already fall in love with this watch, the watch shipped to me in 4 days time and im in Singapore, pretty fast. everything is working perfectly no scratches, But the only problem is cleaning cloth is not packed inside.
B004SBULWE|5.0|This app has helped so much.  My apps were causing everything to slow down.  No problems since I added this program!
B004GYNPL2|5.0|easy to use and I love the backup options so if you get a new phone or lose it and your info is backed up you don't lose it all and have to reenter it.
1594203059|5.0|Wow, what an amazing, exciting and insightful historical analysis of how we all got here!  By \\"here,\\" I mean to say, at Amazon, browsing books on line, reading the reviews of anonymous readers with wildly divergent opinions!<br /><br />Before I write anything, remember this:  Comparative Culture is, by definition, based on human opinion, and its study can be polarizing and emotionally sensitive.  This book will get your back up, one way or the other.<br /><br />There are many detailed reviews already written on this controversial volume, so I'll just cut RIGHT to the chase:  If you're a conservative American (or European, for that matter), and you think we are \\"by God, the strongest country on earth, never been stronger, and all you foreign hordes coming from Asia can love it or leave it!\\" then this book is NOT for you.  If you're a Tea Partier or a Rick Perry supporter, this book is going to rankle you, maybe even offend you, because Dr. Ferguson recognizes that the United States is an empire in serious trouble.  But he doesn't leave the story there.<br /><br />On the other side of the coin, if you're a staunch \\"declinist,\\" a radical environmentalist, an Occupier, or a gloom-and-doom jeremiah, this book will ALSO put you off.  Niall Ferguson is far too sophisticated a social critic to be easily labeled.  He's not a flag waving patriot, and he's not a red-hot revolutionary.  He's an enormously accomplished historian who believes that our times are BAD, that civilization is dangerously close to rapid disintegration, that the loss of standards and civility in life are creating a world of unimaginable selfishness, that fear and greed rule the WORLD, not just the markets, and that mass consumerism leads to boredom, loneliness and depression.  There's just one catch:  He believes we can fix it.  He believes we NEED to fix it, quickly, URGENTLY!<br /><br />So who will actually LIKE this book?  Political scientists, intellectuals, and liberals with enough time and money to contemplate BIG issues will love this book.  Your typical suburban professional, with a mind inquisitive enough to wonder what the hell is going on will love this book.  Anyone living in the \\"West\\" with the feeling that we're muddling through a decade-long malaise will appreciate this book.  Your political persuasion is really not important.<br /><br />Dr. Ferguson gets our attention by first dispelling the historical misconception that strong empires tend to fade away with time, due to internal stagnation and external competition.  Well, he wants us to know that empires don't fade away, they CRUMBLE, usually within a generation.  He supports this view with historical evidence.  In other words, we live in a world within which many great civilizations have come crashing down due to [the same] internal stagnation and external competition in a matter of a few years.  He thinks the \\"West,\\" and the United States in particular, are dangerously close to falling off the cliff.  The Eurozone, too.<br /><br />He wants to \\"save\\" the \\"West\\" from this outcome by 1) sounding the alarm and 2) offering recommendations on how this might be done.  This is really, REALLY important and amazing stuff.<br /><br />The book centers around a metaphor of the \\"West\\" using its \\"killer apps\\" to rapidly advance economically from the \\"Rest\\" over the past 500 years.  He sets up a beautifully effective structuralist argument that the \\"West\\" adopted an \\"operating system\\" which became the world standard, and that six \\"killer apps\\" were designed for that operating system that completely marginalized the rest of the world.  Dr. Ferguson is quite specific about the six \\"killer apps\\" around which he constructs his argument.  You'll have to read the book to learn what they are!  He dedicates a chapter to detailed discussion of each of these killer apps, and explores how the \\"Rest\\" are catching up to the \\"West\\" because they have simply learned how to download these apps, and make them work within their own \\"operating system.\\"<br /><br />The \\"Rest\\" adopted an \\"operating system\\" that may have been technically superior, but became marginal because it was not pragmatic or expedient.  Here, he's referring to the great Asian and African civilizations, and he's stuffing (and generalizing) the comparative political analysis into a \\"Beta vs. VHS\\" or \\"Apple vs. Microsoft\\" metaphor.  I love it!<br /><br />Here's the punchline:  The six killer apps of the West have become corrupted by viruses and are losing there competitive advantage due to COMPLACENCY.  We need to refocus on the continued development of our killer apps, and then \\"reboot\\" the entire system.  We'll become the better performing, restored machine after this, moved back from the brink by own our effort and skill.  We'll need to accommodate a new operating system too, because Asia is rapidly advancing.<br /><br />If we fail to recognize the problem, our killer apps, and our entire operating system may be replaced by another more aggressive and adaptable standard.  The world will become one-sided.  The metaphor refers here to the emergence of Asia, once again, supported by historical trends.  For those of you who rave that Dr. Ferguson's thesis is racist, I offer this:  He's not comparing RACE anywhere in the text, but he is comparing CULTURE.  Once again, we're talking about comparative culture, which is an extremely sensitive topic.  And, if anything, he is praising the enormous advancements of the civilizations OUTSIDE the \\"West.\\"<br /><br />I think this is a brilliant thesis, told with powerful insight, strong historical references, and a lovely post-modern allegorical structure.<br /><br />Niall Ferguson doesn't know everything, but he is smart enough to know when things are bad enough to take notice.  And he's optimistic enough in the tools he learned as a \\"Westerner\\" to believe that there's much more good work to do.  The West is too young to die.  Our apps work.  They need updates...  now.<br /><br />Will we heed the call to fix things, or will we let stagnant gridlock, selfish intolerance and complacency destroy our civilization?  Niall Ferguson believes the choice is ours.  WE can work for a better society, or we can continue to go our own way, knocking down anyone and everyone who stands in our way to...  what?  More debt, more stagnation, and more Lexapro?<br /><br />This book is, obviously, highly politically charged, and it does NOT respect the decorum we would generally describe as \\"politically correct.\\"  It's an easy read about weighty issues, but it's going to make you either mad as hell or thankful for such a penetrating mind.  But if it moves you to action or, at least to contemplation, it's a successful book.ay have been technically superior, but became marginal because it was not pragmatic or expedient.

0062011847|2.0|\\"You can't abduct goblins,' said Captain Murderer. 'Goblins is cargo!' Vimes let this one pass for the moment. Captain Murderer would be orientated to the world as seen by Commander Vimes at Commander Vimes's leisure.\\" (p.314)  Unfortunately the reader of 'Snuff' is not shown the mercy that Captain Murderer received from Commander Vimes, and for a leisurely 378 pages we are orientated to the world as seen by Commander Vimes/Terry Pratchett to the exclusion of any particularly interesting story, characterisation, wit or humour. This is in what is labelled on the cover as 'A Discworld Novel', but which bears little resemblance to that series. A quote on the dust-jacket of my copy reminds us that Terry Pratchett is the premier author of comic fantasy, but I honestly can find little of either comedy or fantasy in 'Snuff'. If you changed the goblins to an oppressed ethnic minority it could easily just be a rather mediocre crime novel. The earlier Discworld books often started with a reference to Great A'Tuin the turtle swimming lazily through space with the Discworld on his back. And when we narrowed our focus it would be on a man finding a mystical guitar in a transdimensional music store, or the monks of time discovering that history was about to fall apart, or the eighth son of an eighth son about to flood the world with raw magic. Not a middle-aged policeman disrupting a smuggling ring in a sleepy country town. Something has gone awry somewhere along the line.  Of course Terry Pratchett is free to take his fictional world in any direction he wants, but I'm baffled as to what is the point of it. Do many Discworld fans need to hear heavy-handed sermons on the immorality of slavery and the need for universal rights? Surely that is an important issue, but the Pratchett of old would have pulled it off with a bit of class and subtlety. His humanism always peeked out from underneath the mad fantasy world he created, it did not sit on top of it in a lump of leaden moralisingand squeeze its life out.   And what happened to his legendary wit? In some Discworld novels you can't turn the page without encountering a clever 'pune, or play on words'. 'Snuff' has about three jokes in the whole thing, and pretty limp ones. Yes, six-year-olds find poo jokes consistently hilarious, but very few people who read 'Snuff' will be six-year-olds. And the bit about the [mildly amusing boat name] is repeated endlessly. Yeah, I get it. And Sam Vimes has officially become the most obnoxious character in fiction. He spends the whole story barely restraining himself from murdering various criminals, congratulating himself on his toughness and cunning, bending the law to suit his purposes, reminding everyone how rich and powerful he is, and spreading 'enlightenment' to all the benighted savages that he meets.  I have read some of my Discworld novels up to ten times. I barely managed to finish this one once. Great A'Tuin can swim on without me from now on, I think.
B004EN8KE2|1.0|I gave up trying to listen to this after about 1 and 1/2 chapters!!  The reader is ALL WRONG for the role of Katniss, she sounds like she is in her mid to late 50s... Katniss is a TEENAGER!!!  And the intonation is just awkward, I just had to give up, it would ruin the book for people to listen to this, in my opinion.
B005SV9X22|2.0|I like her performances but...why she talk too much in the concert?? It really make the show sooo boring. Honestly her performances were great except the talking part.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I was a little worried at the initail reviews of this case prior to receiving it.  Once I snapped the Kindle securely into it, I loved it. I feel like it protects it very well and has a very low profile and has a great feel to it. The rubberized texture works well.  The stand function works well enough for most uses.  Everyone I have shown it to loves the way it looks.  Is $29 too much?  Probably so, but the only other option is waiting on generic verisions to come out.
0439023513|1.0|Mockingjay was my dissappointment of the year. Let me clarify: I adored The Hunger Games. I was in love with Catching Fire. But I wish Mockingjay didn't have to let it all end so tragically.   Basically, Mockingjay starts out right from where Catching Fire left off, with Katniss being rescued from the games. She discovers \\"district 13\\" which is holding a revolution against the Capitol...except district 13 kind of sucks too. At this point, I'm left wondering, so whats worth fighting for? Katniss is annoying too, not like our heroine from the other books. She's constantly blacking out, she's just not as strong as she used to be. And I won't even get started about the end. Let's just say that I'm not sure any of the rebellion was worth it.   (spoiler ahead)  The only thing I was happy about was that Katniss and Peeta made it out alive and together. Still, the ending sucked. It felt contrived, and rushed. I wouldnt mind if Suzanne gave us an alternate ending. Or they could change it for the movie. Which, btw, the previews just came out for THG and it looks awesome!!! I'm so excited for 1 and 2. Can't say I'm all that excited for book 3's movie though. Just sayin'.
B00005O438|4.0|While watching CUJO, a grand film adaptation of one of Stephen King's best horror yarns, I cannot help but muse (or, in my case, bemuse):  Had the story taken place today, whereby a mother and her young son become trapped inside a rundown hatchback by a rabid St. Bernard, all mom would have to do is grab her cell, call 911, and in minutes Animal Control would be there to promptly dispatch the animal to Doggy Heaven.<br /><br />The lesson here is, technology negates a modern remake.  But I digress.<br /><br />So many of King's novels adapted to the big screen are startlingly mediocre, but CUJO is a delightful exception.  This movie is grand, hair-bristling fun, because we don't have some monster, or other metaphysical manifestation--we have a big dog that contracts rabies and as a result develops a serious attitude.  I don't care how much of a dog lover anyone professes to be, all of us are intimidated by a large, snarling, vicious dog; that's what makes CUJO so utterly and terrifyingly believable.  To enhance said believability, Dee Wallace is very convincing as the overwrought mother, and Danny Pintauro acts like all 6-year-old boys would act in such a dire situation (he screams and cries and complains a lot).  The pacing and suspense are keen, with just a tad discomfort for the Bad Momma moment at the end, but if heart-pounding suspense fits your bill, then take CUJO off his leash and enjoy.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|I received the cover the same day I received my Kindle Fire and it definitely is not what I expected, especially for the price. The cover is very thin, and it does not hold up the Kindle Fire very well. The \\"plastic\\" part of the case feels slightly sturdy and slightly rubberized feel, but the front cover is a thin felt like cover.  I think what bothers me is that it was so expensive. If I had paid about $20 for the product, I probably wouldn't have been so disappointed. I am glad that Amazon did decide to price adjust for the pre-order, even so, still over priced.
1439181780|5.0|Ok, before I talk about the book I feel I must share something. I just returned from a full weekend conference given by Hayhouse where their most prominent authors gave lectures, usually about two hours long. All of them write in the self-improvement or new age genres and so all of them were inspiring and uplifting. The thing is, there was SO much information given to me at one time...and so much of it would slightly contradict what the previous author had said...that I left unsure how much I had even absorbed. It wasn't until I returned home that \\"The Power\\" popped back into my head and that's when I realized just how valuable a book it really is.<br /><br />\\"The Secret\\" absolutely talks about our feelings being even more significant than our thoughts or words when it comes to attracting the experiences we want. It's in \\"The Power\\", though that this is examined even further. For those who don't know, this \\"power\\" the author refers to is love :)<br /><br />When I first picked up the book, I scoffed. You see, I had read and watched \\"The Secret\\" years ago when it first came out (ok, I think it was like five years ago...let's not be that dramatic). And while I absolutely loved it, I didn't experience the best results. I also started getting tired of constantly affirming and focusing on manifestion...it just became exhausting. So when I stumbled upon this new book in B&N (sorry Amazon), I thought, \\"well, here we go again.\\" So I turned to a random page...and forever whatever reason, I was hooked.<br /><br />I don't know why I didn't understand the whole \\"feeling\\" portion of \\"The Secret\\" because they DO absolutey cover it...but \\"The Power\\" really drills this into your mind. What I love about this book is that the author keeps the concepts very simple and then uses the bulk of the book to give you examples that I personally found incredibly inspiring. The basic concept is that everything in the Universe is either positive or negative...love or lack of love...light or dark. If you want to attract more positive things than negative things, all you have to do is tip the scale of your FEELINGS more to the positive side than the negative side. That's it! (and for anybody who just thought, \\"what do you mean THAT's IT\\"...careful...because that's negative ;)<br /><br />Feelings are REALLY important when working with manifestation and I will tell you why. No matter what it is you want or desire...I really don't care what it is...the ONLY reason that you want to bring that into your life is because you believe you will FEEL better once you have it. Period and end of story. The heart is a huge magnet in the body and the frequency it sends out is POWERFUL!!! So if you want those things that will bring you happiness tomorrow, you must think of them from a loving, joyful place TODAY!!!<br /><br />Better yet, you don't even have to \\"manifest\\" things, per say. Instead, you can simply practice falling in love with everything that is around you NOW. When you see something you love, you can feel happiness deep within your heart for that moment and then let it go. Just don't be surprised if that certain something keeps showing up in your life ;) The bottom line is that whatever emotion starts your day will most likely snowball and that's the emotion that will attract the experience you refer to as your future. So even if you aren't working on manifesting specific things, you can instead use the concepts taught in \\"The Power\\" simply to discipline yourself into attracting happier experiences, in general. Interestingly enough, some of the most successful people in this world didn't start out saying they wanted to be famous or make a million dollars. Instead, they just went about life with an open heart and asked themselves how they could help other people be happy. So keeping your heart open and acting from love can STILL bring you the things many people dream about, but without obsessing about manifestion.<br /><br />One concept that I LOVE in this book is that it's impossible to feel bad in the exact moment you are having a good thought. When I first read this I laughed and rolled my eyes and then made a sincere effort to prove the author wrong...and I couldn't do it!!! The moment I could make myself feel bad, I had already changed my good thought into a bad one. So I continued the experiment the next day and you would have been amazed if you saw what happened. Literally one amazing and happy event and interaction with people was followed by another and another and another! A presentation that I had been anxious about the day before went WAY better than I could have EVER anticipated. My teachers (I was in a yoga teacher training) had given literally everybody else notes and yet after I gave my teaching presentation (after hours of ONLY thinking positive thoughts) they said, \\"wow...that was GREAT...um, we really don't have any notes for you at all.\\" As I was smiling ear to ear, another student said, \\"well, nobody's going to want to go after THAT.\\" (and mind you, there was nothing out of the ordinary spectacular about the presentation other than my heart was wide open both before and during!)<br /><br />As far as criticism is concerned...well, this book is about love and the power behind it. So really, the people who criticize it are simply proving the concepts of the book to be true. If you think, \\"this book is stupid...all these books are the same....what a bunch of fluff...you've got to be kidding me...\\" well, all of those thoughts are followed with negative feelings and so people who think and FEEL that will be attracting plenty of negative experiences, hence writing a negative review. So in my experience, it couldn't be a problem with the book but rather how disciplined the reader is in applying the concepts CONSISTENTLY in their daily life. Are they really starting their day with meditation and getting in the most amazing, joyful state before starting their day? When they visualize their dreams are they just seeing pictures or are they adding the emotions on top of the pictures? If something unexpected happens...traffic jam, spilled coffee, long line at the grocery store (all a result of PAST feelings, by the way)...are they able to stay either neutral...or better yet, positive despite what is in front of their eyes?<br /><br />It does take discipline to apply the principles in the book, but the GREAT news is that it feels AMAZING at the same time! Why? Because LOVE feels AMAZING!!! As \\"A Course in Miracles\\" says: everything in the Universe is either an Act of Love or a Call for Love. When you learn to make everything you do an act of love, you will attract more and more of it into your life, in ways you could least expect :)<br /><br />I recommend this book SOOOOO highly (I mean, clearly)!!! And while I love all of the other authors out there and think that it's great to hear many differnt perspectives, the bottom line is that love is truly what makes the world go round. So if you want to read a million books, make sure this is one of them. And if you only want to read one book this holiday season, buy \\"The Power\\"!!!!<br /><br />Thank you, Rhonda Byrne...you rock my world.<br /><br />:)s that it's impossible to feel bad in the exact moment you are having a good thought.

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I adore Harry Potter. In fact I am fanatical about the Franchise. I own the audiobooks of the series, the books and every single one of the DVD's including the deluxe versions.  So when I recieved my bluray 3 disc set I was so excited.  However, the excitement turned to disappointment when I went to load the \\"special features\\" disc and my bluray player displayed the words \\"unknown disc.\\"  The bluray disc does that was a part of this 3 disc set did not play in my bluray player.  I then purchased the same set from two other stores and unfortunately they did not play the \\"special features\\" disc either.  Has anyone else had this problem?  Unfortunately I am going to have to send this back to Amazon for a refund.  I'm so disappointed.
1451648537|5.0|I must say this was one of the most incredibly insightful and exciting biographies I have ever read. The relationship that he developed, both productive and not productive, over the course of his life were fascinating to read about. His technical, business, creative and personal associations had both a sensitive and pragmatic side to them. The book was hard to put down. I would highly recommend it
B000KIPT30|4.0|I bought this item a few months ago to a) extend my headphone cables across the room (using the box as the midpoint for 2 cables, with power) and b) to give me some control over the volume of today's ultra-dynamic movies (especially horror and suspense).  My poor neighbors get blown out if I turn the volume up enough to hear the quiet parts.  This little box has worked well for the past few months... even after getting kicked around the floor a fair piece.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|Best album of the year!! Drake has true talent and his own unique sound and style to his music. He is such a great artist
0802798225|4.0|I liked it, but it was, of course, predictable.  I read this about a year ago, and I can still vividly remember the characters well enough to pick up the sequel and follow.  It's definitely worth the purchase; it's very entertaining.
B0040ZN9WM|2.0|I'm so sad to be giving a bad review on these shayna cause they're so cute, but my little one cannot keep them on. I thought maybe it was too big cause they were kind of loose on her so they kept falling off, but now they fit perfectly and it still comes off. I compared them to the classics, although these are much cuter, they just don't fit well due to design. back strap is too thin and does not conform to heel, it doesn't move with the heels so it can chafe or fall off.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I placed my order back in Oct and was not expecting my oder until after the 18th of November.  I got home yesterday Nov16 and there was my movie.  Great Service as always, you can never go wrong when you order from Amazon.
0321784421|5.0|I found this book to be a good update on the new stuff (and there's a lot more than just 30 new elements) in HTML5, including good information on WAI-ARIA and accessibility issues... and I find the price to be good for what you get.<br /><br />This book mainly discusses only the new elements in HTML5, and the new form input types and attributes (which allow a level of form validation without requiring JavaScript). It also has chapters on the new \\"video\\" and \\"audio\\" elements, canvas, data storage, going offline, drag and drop, geolocation (though not part of HTML5), messaging (the Messaging API) and worker threads (multi-threading in JavaScript), and a chapter on patching older browsers to support HTML5 today (called \\"polyfilling\\"). Some useful information is given about browser support for new HTML5 elements and attributes, but not a lot (too much browser support info would just make the book get out of date even faster).<br /><br />It's important to note that this book is not for the HTML beginner. The reader should already be familiar with HTML (like HTML 4), CSS, and JavaScript. Also, this is not a reference book, so don't count on that. If it were a reference book, it would be A LOT bigger and probably less beneficial.<br /><br />Some have mentioned the humor in this book. Let's just say it is \\"childish\\" and \\"sophomoric\\"; the authors must have an underlying desire to be \\"megahunks\\". But many may find this type of humor funny (depending on the type of humor they like), and some could find it offensive and/or annoying and/or unprofessional.<br /><br />NOTE: I had originally read the 1st edition of this book, which I also enjoyed but which was becoming outdated due to how fast things are moving now. The 2nd edition is more up-to-date, corrects some issues in the 1st edition, and has 295 pages instead of 223 pages, so the 2nd edition also has more content.
0312330537|5.0|One of my all time favorite books.  The story is so fascinating that at times it's hard to believe it's a (mostly) true story.  Having been to Mumbai I loved all of his references and could imagine him in the city so clearly.  I never would have imagined someone could have such a life.  A good, long, engrossing read that I highly recommend - I wish there were more books like it out there.
0394818237|4.0|This was one of my favorite books growing up and now my 3 year old son loves this book too.  He really got into at age 3.5 and it is one of the few non-electrical things that can get him to sit quietly for 20 minutes or more.  He loves looking at the machines and pipes and electrical lines and tracing how things \\"go\\" or are made.  I like this book as a parent since it shows how things work and that houses, letters, food, clothes, wood, electricity, roads, and clean water don't magically appear but are the end result of a long process.  Plus, I like that it shows capitalism at work and how money is exchanged for goods and services and nothing is \\"free\\".  It was going to become my standard gift for 3rd birthdays, but when I ordered a copy from Amazon for a friend's child I was disappointed to see that this book is now abridged.  My 1968 edition is 93 pages, whereas the \\"new\\" 1979 edition is 63 pages with 6 of the original stories missing and it no longer has the the inside covers that show the people of Busytown.  My son loves looking at the back inside cover which shows everyone sitting down to dinner together; he likes to pretend he's eating the mountain of hot dogs, the giant ice cream cone, etc...    The missing stories are:  Mother's Work is Never Done, Sergeant Murphy of the Busytown Police Dept, The Airplane Ride, Digging Coal to Make Electricity Work for Us, Cotton and How We Use It, and Water.    The included stories are:  Everyone is a Worker, Building a New House, Mailing a Letter, A Voyage on a Ship, Firemen to the Rescue, A Visit to the Hospital, The Train Trip, The Story of Seeds and How They Grow (corn), Wood and How We Use It, Building a New Road, and Where Bread Comes From.  Of the missing stories, The Airplane Ride, Coal & Electricity, and Water are among my son's favorites and I like reading him the Cotton story since it shows how cotton is spun, dyed, woven, and turned into clothes.      I'm bummed that this is not the book I remember and I am not as excited to be giving it as a gift.  Now it's just a good book instead of a GREAT book.  I hope Random House will pay attention to these reviews and reprint the original unabridged book.  And I hope my kids treat MY book gently because apparently it's irreplaceable.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|Warning!: \\"The Tree of Life\\" is not a very good date movie. If David Lynch and Stanley Kubrick had a baby, while using LSD and channeling Hunter S. Thompson-that would be this movie. Please, for the love of God, do not subject yourself or others to this experiment in despair fraught with death, space nebulae, dinosaur on dinosaur violence, volcanoes and Brad Pitt. I am not responsible if you choose not to heed my warning. Choose well.....  Oh, and my date promptly left after 30 minutes. Thats right, this movie killed my date night!
B001NHZ2KM|5.0|If you know and love the Who - this 1979 film is a must. If you don't - then it's time you did!  Stein's film is meticulous, done with love, a dash of humor and respect.  Best of all, it has no narration. The footage is assembled so that the band speaks/sings/rocks for themselves in the best possible way.  As rock docs go -- and I've produced many myself -- this is one of the very best.

B005F9TQ2Y|5.0|I am a Dylan fanatic, as I have said many times. I'm not bragging by any stretch, but I own literally just about every piece of music the man has put out. Bootlegs, complete live concerts, rare soundtrack songs, outtakes, acetates, you name it. If it's Dylan, odds are I have it. So this review is coming from a true Dylanologist here.   The album that made me a Dylan fan was 'Infidels.' While this was not the first Dylan album I bought (that honor goes to 1970's 'Self Portrait,' which I bought more than a few years ago), it was certainly the most important Dylan record I ever bought. Instantly, the songs resonated with me. It was almost a revelation. Having heard all of Dylan's records, the one I come back to most is probably 'Infidels.'  The year is 1983. Dylan is coming off of his Christian period, which turned off many critics and rock fans alike. 'Slow Train Coming,' 'Saved' and 'Shot of Love,' his two Christian albums released in 1979, 1980 and 1981, respectively, were not warmly received (although 'Slow Train Coming' sold well and did garner a hit single in 'Gotta Serve Somebody,' as well as some critical praise). It was obvious: by this time, Dylan needed a great record, and he needed one pronto.  So he assembled what was perhaps his finest band. Hiring reggae legends Sly Dunbar & Robbie Shakespeare to play drums and bass respectively, Mick Taylor (of The Rolling Stones) in a dual guitar role with Mark Knopfler (of Dire Straits, who had also worked with Dylan in 1979 on 'Slow Train Coming') plus fellow Dire Straits keyboardist Alan Clark, Dylan had assembled what could only be called a \\"dream band.\\"  And while the musicians seem like a random assortment, they amazingly blend incredibly well together as a unit. Knopfler and Taylor were meant for each other. Their opposite stylings of the guitar combine together to form a unique sound. This is the way a lead guitar duo is supposed to sound. Sly & Robbie both provide a remarkable reggae-esque backbeat, and Clark's keyboards add a solid soundscape for the musicians.  Now, what about the songs you may ask? Well, this was some of Dylan's best writing in years. 'Jokerman' could have easily appeared on one of his '60s records, and it is amazingly still relevant today. 'License to Kill' remains one of Dylan's great post-'60s protest songs, and 'I and I' shows off Dylan's interest in reggae, as well as how great Sly & Robbie are as a rhythm section. While I do prefer Dylan & The Grateful Dead's version of 'Man of Peace' that they performed on tour in 1987 (a rehearsal version of this track can be found on the Grateful Dead disc 'Postcards of the Hanging - The Grateful Dead Perform the Songs of Bob Dylan'), the version found here is remarkable.  Dylan is also known to close records with a ballad (namely 'Tonight I'll Be Staying Here with You,' 'Every Grain of Sand,' and 'I'll Be Your Baby Tonight'), and he continues the tradition here. 'Don't Fall Apart on Me Tonight' contains some of Dylan's best lyrics that he wrote in the 1980s, and his harmonica playing here is especially stellar and emotional. THIS is how a record should close.  While there are many great outtakes from 'Infidels' that could have easily made the cut ('Blind Willie McTell,' 'Foot of Pride,' 'Clean Cut Kid,' and 'Death is Not the End,' namely -- the latter two showed up in slightly altered versions on later albums), 'Infidels' is about as good an album as Dylan's ever made. The musicianship is top-notch, Dylan is in fine vocal form, and his songwriting here is just remarkable.   Along with 'Oh Mercy,' 'Infidels' represents Dylan's best work of the 1980s. And if you liked 'Infidels,' check out 'Real Live' while you are at it. 'Real Live' captures a few shows from the European leg of the tour promoting this album. The band on that record is tight as well, featuring Taylor, Ian McLagan (of The Small Faces/Faces) on keyboards, Colin Allen on drums (of the band Focus), as well as featuring Carlos Santana as a guest guitarist on some tracks. Check that disc out as well if you liked this one and have some cash to spare. It's a fine live album.  Overall, I cannot recommend 'Infidels' enough. BY FAR one of Dylan's best records.  HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
0812992792|4.0|This book is dark in many ways. I think of it as grey because of the atmosphere of North Korea where it takes place. The author has visited North Korea so it is fascinating to witness the vision of a boy's growth (stunted though it may be because of this environment). The few flashes of color are from inconsiderable exposure to the west through radio broadcasts  ( he monitors them in the bowels of a fishing vessel) or kidnapping assignments in Japan.  Our \\"Orphan\\"  is asked to take a flight to Texas with officials seeking a deal with a Texas Senator.I almost disliked the senator more than some North Koreans. Then comes the twist and our orphan either assumes an identity or disappears.  The skills this boy has acquired from his understanding of English to being able to function in total darkness are both a gift and a curse from the government. How the North Koreans brainwash their citizens from birth and shield them from enlightenment  or hope while teaching them to work only in the interest of the state and its \\"Great Leader\\" are inconceivable until you observe the cruel fates of so many of their victims in this book. While such a different and horrible way of life, the tale rings true due to accounts of those who have escaped to the west. This is a survival tale and I definitely read this during the day or with bright lights.

B005HSG3TC|4.0|This case is just what I expected. Light, protective, great feel and the stand works fine. I really don't understand the negative reviews.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|If you only want the BluRay movies you cant go wrong with this. When I bought mine there was a better deal for more extra content on the UK version, but it was a preorder. I like that this box set contains all 8 movies in one case the size of two normal cases. It is not 8 individual slim cases. This works well for me because I dislike the slim cases but am running out of room on my bookshelf.<br />Again if you do not care about all the special feature discs and just want to watch the Movies you cant go wrong with this set; especially at the sale price.
B004ZNACA6|2.0|I'll keep this short: Musically, each of these albums casts a formidable shadow. From the whimsical, pioneering \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" to the massive production of \\"The Wall,\\" Floyd set trends with every LP. But this is a review of the sonics, so I'll keep it at that.  From an audiophile's standpoint, there's VERY little difference between the 1992 masters used in the \\"Shine On\\" box and these 2011 remasters. In fact, I couldn't discern much difference. The 2011s were arguably mastered at a lower volume, but the 1992s were just as dynamic and detailed. This is really a sad marketing campaign, because EMI is making all sorts of claims--their Guthrie original master tapes, yada, yada, yada--but the truth is that their \\"wonder masters\\" are barely different from discs (mastered by guru Doug Sax) that came out 19 years ago!   This is not to suggest that these 2011 remasters sound bad--they certainly don't--but then again, they SHOULD sound considerably better than what came before, given all the hype, but they just do not. Considering record company marketing, I'm not at all surprised that these remasters don't sound markedly better than their older counterparts. Another attempt to get uneducated consumers to buy something they've already bought five times before.  Me, I'm sticking on to my Japanese mini-LPs, which use the '92 masters. They sound great, and there's really no reason to \\"upgrade\\" to the 2011s.
B001UV4XJ2|2.0|I just rate it with no more than 3 stars because I didn't bought the item yet, I was going to do it, but muy deception is because is released the product only with dvd region 1, that's unfair biscuits! why doesn't WB sell its product set to other regions too?! then its they claim next time about piracy and copyrights violated in southamerica, of course if they are unwilling to sell us the original product with properly dvd zone/region. There you need to fix that failure please. That WB be fair with all HP fans!

B005HSG3TC|4.0|I think this cover was pretty much as I expected. I wanted one that would be secure and fit as snugly as possible , without too much added weight. I feel that's what I got. My judgement is that it provides adequate protection. Yes it might be somewhat expensive but so are many of these accessories - razor blade theory I think. The cover does fold back to allow you to stand the Fire up at an angle for video viewing - perhaps on a plane if the video has been pre-downloaded before the journey. My take is that you have to tuck the flap into the elastic strap to make it stand securely.   Note the Fire is somewhat heavier than I expected for its size so when holding it for any length of time in this cover the plastic rigid edges may dig into your hands and irritate.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I got this cover a day before I got my Kindle Fire which I received this morning. I read the other reviews and got nervous. Well the cover looks like an old time classic leather bound book. I put my Kindle Fire in and it fits great. Evidently people expect it to be a perfect \\"snug\\" totally flat fit. Now I will use this primarily for reading, so the speakers are of a minor concern to me, so the strap covering the edge near the speakers are a non issue. I streamed Julia Child for fun as a test and used ear phones .... and even took the phones out and heard Julia just fine. I just set it on my nightstand face down and it does lie flat with the beautiful spine showing. I think this cover is totally classy and I love that it has no zippers, straps, snaps, buttons, velcro tabs or ties. It looks like a book and opens in the same simple way.

However its too much for my needs, but if u luv too customize yr multiple alarms, then this is it, cause customizations are endless!

B005V2EVBQ|1.0|Wow -- how disappointing is this case? I've seen better cases in the .99cents store. My Fire is awkward when in the stand-up mode, it is flimsy, cheaply made, and I will guarantee you that it will not last 3 months! Avoid at all costs. I am returning this and ordering the splash SIGNATURE Folio Leather Case Cover Fits Amazon Kindle FIRE Tablet with Stand (Black) instead, based on another reviewers comments and the ratings. Marware: you are a ripoff!!!

B002OG5GT8|5.0|Don't misunderstand me... my B&W DM6s with a decent amplifier sound better from the next room, but for twenty bux, the sound coming out of my Sansa Clip, through this amp, and through my Ultimate Ears earbuds is very enjoyable.  Being a recovering bassist, I listen with the bass boost on, and the low end actually sounds like someone is playing a bass... not like the nondescript thump of a muddy low end.  For Sam Cooke songs, you can appreciate the upright bass, for Moody Blues, the biamped Rick, and for Willie Nelson... you can still detect the annoying warble of his ancient reverb.  I'm getting another for the Clip I use for workouts... I wonder how one would sound connected to my PC?  Hmmmm

1451648537|5.0|I'm different than most. I didn't grow up in SV, but I found myself wanting to move from the Phoenix area (another booming electronics town) to SV as soon as I had the chance.   I was a few years younger but spent time at many of the same haunts as Steve did a few years prior. Ames/NASA, Halted Electronics, family that worked at HP, our first Apple computers, smoking grass, dropping acid.  If you, like me, have always revered science, technology, humanities and art, mixed with free enterprise and personal freedoms, then you will love this book.   And if you spent your youth in SV like I did, and made a go at being the best you could be, and help others with the fruits of your creativity, then you will find that we all as human beings have a great deal that binds us together, very well illustrated in this work.  Steve was so great at it, it's really fun to read about his life, his character and what made his views so rich and ahead of their time.  Well done.
0321784421|5.0|This is a well written and entertaining book that adequately covers HTML5. While not meant to be an encyclopedia of the new specification, it treats the subject with thoroughness. The writing is witty as is informative.

B005UG542S|5.0|Most of the negative and one-star reviews are actually about the quality of the dvds that have been purchased or Amazon's service. I think that there needs to be a separate place, like a customer service area, where customers can complain, because when I came to see the reviews, I really wanted to see what viewers thought about the movie.  Anyway, I watched the Deathly Hallows, part 2 and it was amazing. Masterful way of combining the best moments from the book into a breath-taking, emotional, nail-biting roller-coaster of a movie. Very well made - even though I have read the book close to 5 times and knew what would happen, the movie still kept me at the edge of my seat. Neville didn't disappoint, Ron was OK, too bad Bellatrix didn't have more screen time, Snape was great as always.   In short - I wish Rowling had written a couple more before the final final ending. I will miss the wonderful world her imagination has created, I will definitely watch all the movies again... and again:). And again:)
B005JLN9ZI|4.0|The content of the product was great. I just didn't like that iTunes had the \\"real\\" deluxe edition, that includes two extra tracks and a digital book.. Only on iTunes. To me it really sucks.

B005I6EVUG|4.0|I bought this case for the Fire even though it doesn't actually say it's FOR the Fire.  (Note, I purchased at a retail store and the pkg doesn't say for Kindle Fire, but I noticed online here it does say it's for the Fire).  But it does fit, although tightly.  I'm okay with a tight fit, it feels very secure in the cover and the cover itself is just gorgeous - very eye-catching.  My only concern about this cover is durability of the elastic straps.  If even one of the straps were to break you're totally screwed and the unit could fall out.  But in looking online at other covers, even vastly more expensive ones, they pretty much all utilize the elastic straps.  When I purchased this I tried to find anything about any kind of warranty on it, but could only find that it is made in China, nothing about a warranty.  I'm keeping my eye on it and will continue to use it while I search for one with some type of holders that make me feel better about it.   STILL, I cannot emphasize enough that this is a gorgeous, well-made cover.  It feels heavy and durable and I looked at a lot of covers, holding them and sliding my Fire in and out, and most of the others were very flimsy feeling.  This is rock solid - it reminds me a lot of the red leather cover from Amazon that held my K3.  I saw another review of this that said the cover wouldn't close?  I have not had that experience AT ALL - it closes completely.  I think that reviewer may have been talking about a different cover entirely, because he mentions a magnet - there is no magnet built into this cover, and shouldn't be.  What would it adhere to?  My cover closes completely, bends back totally when I'm reading.  No troubles at all.  After I wrote this initial review (this paragraph is an edit) I went into some local stores as they got their cover selections in, and I really just could not find any that were anywhere near the quality of this cover.  Others were so flimsy and cheap looking.  This one looks a lot more expensive than it is.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Good game where there is rarely a &quot;wrong&quot; answer.  Nice, quick levels.  A lot of fun and easy to play.
1400069181|3.0|I am all about the charitable and the worthy cause, and I love the whole Toms concept. In fact, I don't dislike the book, it just isn't what I expected. I was expecting a biography and this is more of an interactive work--not necessarily a bad thing. Regardless, we need more TOMS in the world, more people to \\"start something that matters,\\" and if this book pushes that process along, more power to it!
0307586901|4.0|This is,as Martha always does, clear and concise with wonderful photographic examples. I will refer to it frequently as a holiday crafting source.
0385344325|5.0|Lee Child must have a thing for small-town America. Maybe it's the sense of isolation he's able to achieve when there are only a few thousand people living in the town? Child's last three \\"Jack Reacher\\" novels have taken place in various tiny venues, effectively cut off from civilization except for the highway that runs past it a few miles away. The Affair, Child's latest novel, is another example of this phenomenon, and while this aspect of the series is starting to get a bit old, it makes for a riveting tale in this case.<br /><br />Jack Reacher is a drifter and a problem-solver, moving from place to place and helping those who need help, either with his quick intelligence or his right hook. The Affair tells of what started Reacher on his long road, way back in 1997. He's an Army Military Police officer, sent down to Carter Crossing, Mississippi, where a woman has been murdered, potentially by one of the soldiers stationed at the Army base there. Reacher is there to mingle with the townspeople as another officer investigates on the base itself. The murder may have drastic political implications where the cover-up is sometimes worse than the crime. Reacher gets involved with the beautiful local sheriff, and the affair may be affecting Reacher's thinking--and might end up getting him killed.<br /><br />Reacher constantly reminds the reader that this story takes place in 1997, before the heightened security caused by the 9/11 attacks. This method of storytelling confused me at first, because I thought this would end up with Reacher telling the story to someone else. However, there is no framing story, and I soon learned to just go with the flow. It gives the story more immediacy and power, especially because this is the first Reacher book (at least in my experience) to be told in first-person.<br /><br />Reacher is the same type of guy readers are already familiar with, though the lessons that he has since learned on the road aren't there yet. He still follows his duty as an Army officer, though it begins to get strained as events in the novel wear on. He finds himself being torn in two different directions, even more so when information starts to come out that changes everything about the case.<br /><br />Child's characterizations in The Affair are marvellous, from Reacher himself to Sheriff Devereaux and the other locals in Carter Crossing. All of them come across as three-dimensional (or at least 2.5). Devereaux is an interesting woman with secrets of her own, and the uneasy trust that begins to develop between Reacher and her is interesting to watch. She also makes a great contrast to Reacher.<br /><br />That also applies to Child's dialogue and prose. The book is divided into very short, punchy chapters. I usually hate this, as it makes the story seem choppy. In The Affair, however, it adds to the intensity of the book, in addition to making it really hard to put down.

He finds himself being torn in two different directions, even more so when information starts to come out that changes everything about the case.  Child's characterizations in The Affair are marvellous, from Reacher himself to Sheriff Devereaux and the other locals in Carter Crossing. All of them come across as three-dimensional (or at least 2.5). Devereaux is an interesting woman with secrets of her own, and the uneasy trust that begins to develop between Reacher and her is interesting to watch. She also makes a great contrast to Reacher.  That also applies to Child's dialogue and prose. The book is divided into very short, punchy chapters. I usually hate this, as it makes the story seem choppy. In The Affair, however, it adds to the intensity of the book, in addition to making it really hard to put down.

B003VS0CWO|5.0|Bought this for my sister.  She is a halloween artist and loves The Rocky Horror movie.  She was so happy to get this.  Got her out of a \\"funk\\" and she is busy creating now.  Brilliant purchase - if I do say so myself.  Trying not to break my arm patting myself on the back. ;-)

B003R50AW8|5.0|This book had me hooked from the first chapter or first playing card as it was. \\"Ed\\" is someone that a lot of us may relate to wether we want to or not and leaves you thinking. I would and have recommended this book to many people and they too have all really enjoyed it. Easy and a very enjoyable read. Buy it!!!! Oh and the three twists in the story are excellent and well thought of.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I must admit after reading the end of this book it became  increasingly more dark and depressing. Although I was a little dissapointed with the ending (I saddly expect a perfect fairy tale ending) I don't know what I could have expected. The entire series is based on a game.where children are thrown into an arena to fight till death what did we expect butterflys and rainbows? On the.otherhand I wish so many characters had not died off and so.quickly and that katniss could have redeemed her self instead of ending as a psychologically damaged weak character because only the insane would not have recognized the simmilarities of snow and coin. Wish the relationship between her and peeta could have been.built back up before dumping us on.the curb and.driving.off.but.i guess thid is the brutal truth of war...?
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I, too, am a little confused by poor reviews of this case. It is exactly as advertised and it appears, to some people, that they simply expected a traditional case and are not familiar with this type of case.<br /><br />I have a very similar case for my iPad by Incase, which cost more and is exactly the same design as this one by Marware. It is intended to provide protection, while preserving the slim design of the device. I do not like cases that add bulk to my devices or are not easy to grip in one hand. I also do not like cases that cover any of the screen or bezels (like some of the leather ones available, or those that require you to strap the device in. Truth be told, I would prefer to have the device \\"naked\\", yet the fact that I put my iPad and Fire into bags and carry around with me, necessitates having some protection.<br /><br />Since the display is Gorilla Glass, it is highly resistant to scratches, therefore the clean, slim cover offers exactly the additional protection that I want. The hard plastic backing provides protection from accidental drops and feels very similar to the nice rubber backing of the Fire (if it were sans case). But, most importantly, this case is the closest to how the device feels without a case, by not adding a ton of extra bulk.<br /><br />The elastic strap is intended for you to keep the cover open or closed, you simply pull the elastic around the front (to hold cover closed) or tuck the cover under it when the cover is open, in order to keep it out of the way. Some people even slide their hand under the elastic and hold the device that way.<br /><br />The cover also acts as a stand. People who obviously got the case before they placed their Fire into it, were wrongly commenting that it won't stay in place...because it is intended to have the weight of the Fire. The stand works perfectly, period.<br /><br />Beyond that, the \\"lightness\\" that some people complained about is intended. I want my cases to feel sturdy, yet not add a larger footprint or weight to the device. This is a wonderful, lightweight and slim case, meant to focus more of your attention on the Fire's screen and not in some heavy, bulky or cumbersome leather case that detracts from the device.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this case. Having used a similar case for my iPad, I was so pleased to see an almost identical one available for the Fire. Previously for my iPad I had bought a leather folio case with a hard cardboard cover...and HATED it. It made holding the device a chore and uncomfortable. I like SLIM, but also knowing that if I throw my Fire in a bag, I do not have to worry about damage. In fact, I do not even use the strap when the cover is closed, because the cover is so thin (but sturdy) that it practically \\"hugs\\" the screen and covers it perfectly.<br /><br />This is an excellent cover and after reading some of the negative reviews, I venture some of these folks are just not accustomed to the newer style of covers outside of leather or hard cover cases. Like I said, I do not want to slide the Fire into a pocket, or have straps covering the screen. I want a cover that gives me an experience as close to if I did not have a cover in the first place. This case is PERFECTLY spec'd for the Fire. It sits very snugly, with appropriate cut-outs for the speakers, power button et al. Best of all, the beautiful screen is not touched or hindered in any way and it feels comfortable in the hand and very close to how the Fire feels without a case...which is my preference.<br /><br />Those who want hand cramps and a cumbersome hard cover, should look elsewhere.a wonderful, lightweight and slim case, meant to focus more of your attention on the Fire's screen and not in some heavy, bulky or cumbersome leather case that detracts from the device.

0316077046|1.0|I would have rather taken a cheese grater to my forehead than continuing reading the idiocy that is Beautiful Darkness. So I literally tore it up and burned it. I didn't think it was possible for a book to step down from Beautiful Creatures but their sequel has proven me wrong. I spent this entire book wondering what the hell the writers had in their bongs while they were composing this heap of perplexing dodo. The plot made less sense than wiping before you poop, and the characters were retarded. Ugh...what a waste of time, money, and medical bills for the eye twitching this book inflicted upon me.

Even though I liked the book the writing style did little to enhance the plot (the use of 'she' at the preceding every sentence became irritating. I think she could have done so much more with it.

It provides personal insight into the hard-learned experiences of true professionals.  Learning from their experiences (and mistakes), I can grow as a person and a developer, just by reading about it.  When situations such as the ones in this book became realities, I knew just how to handle them and just what to do.<br /><br />For the new sde, this book should be at the top of their list.

B004GCPJDQ|5.0|Before I get into my review of this product, let me say I have four magic mice, with my two MacBookPros, Mac Pro, and Mac Mini so you can say I have some experience with the Magic Mouse. The manufacturing tolerance on the stock battery compartment cover on the magic mouse is very close, somewhat tricky to secure and loosely attaches in my opinion. So when you add an aftermarket device in place of the stock battery cover one may experience some problems. Because of my prior experience with the stock battery cover I carefully inserted Mobee inductive charger/battery pack in the mouse and firmly seated it in place. Double checking that it was seated properly before using it.  I initially bought one to try and used it for a month and noting its performance, putting it thru the everyday use with occasional drops off the table. I can't speak for the other people's bad experience but I can say in all honesty that I haven't noticed any difference between a battery powered Magic Mouse and a Mobee powered Magic Mouse.   As the other reviewers pointed out, the mouse now needs to be placed on the charging pad every time after use. If you don't put it on the Mobee pad, the charge will not last past 24 hours because of the limited power capacity of the battery inside the module. Please remember it is not a conventional battery. The battery inside is much smaller to accommodate the electronics that charges the small battery all in the same space two conventional batteries would have resided. I am very family with inductive charged battery devices - my toothbrush so I know it should be set back into its charger after each use. Otherwise I will not have an operational toothbrush which would lead to morning breath which is not good for others ;-D  Bottom line: I've been so happy with it that I am planing on buying additional units for my other three Magic Mice.  I would like to say again that properly inserting the unit is the trickiest part but afterwards it stays in the unit and it's trouble free from then on. Happy computing...
0553805371|3.0|I'm not actually quite sure why I read this... but I picked it up and read it all then put it back down, with no more knowledge than I already had.<br /><br />I think this was Stephen Hawking's way of coming out and saying \\"hey, I think I was wrong.  The universe can be created without God,\\" but he's not exactly going to tell you how.<br /><br />That being said, it's more a memoir than an intellectual, theoretical physics book which I had assumed it was going to be.  There really isn't any details into what exactly that grand design may be.<br /><br />As you already know, save the time and just go read The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene.  It gives much better insight into finding the theory of everything as well as all the juicy details.
B0062A605G|4.0|Just bought this album, and I am loving it.  It is a nice throwback to a time when the music was magical and made you feel a certain type of way.  I don't even buy music anymore because I can't relate to the stuff that's played on the radio nowadays.  This right here was an unexpected and a much needed pleasure.  This is my first Betty Wright album even though I think she is a wonderful singer.  This is just a nice CD to throw in and just let it ride for the weekend.  Get it and enjoy ;-)<br /><br />God bless us all,<br /><br />~ Lex ~
0201633612|5.0|Every person reading this already knows whats up.<br /><br />My only words of caution are those of the authors, which I don't have the quote, but use these design in context!  Just because your boss or dev lead wants to see you using patterns, doesn't mean any of the ones laid out in this book are the end all choice.
B004XS97KO|5.0|This is a great show that has gotten better! If you thought that the 10th doctor was good, you should see Matt Smith. Also it seems like the budget has gotten larger because the effects and writing are SUPERB! His companions this time around are well acted and having three of them makes for many witty remarks, often breaking long held traditions of the show with comical irony.
0132350882|3.0|First off, if you are reading this, I would highly recommend Code Complete over this book.  Code Complete is THE standard for writing clean code.<br /><br />My problem with this book, is that if I were on a project with this guy, I think I would go insane.  It's one thing to open up someone else's work and see a 4,000 line routine, and it's another to open it up and see 4,000 separate routines with 1 line of code, taking up 10,000 lines of space.  The level of abstraction and following SRP seems almost too much, and if followed will clutter your code a little too much.  Running code metrics in VS on this guy's code would likely turn up in the red zone.<br /><br />One reason I will say FOR reading this book, is it gives you insight to another programmer's style of writing.  As we all know in the software industry, there are 10,000 solutions to 10,000 different interpretations and requirements to the same one problem.  With all of this variance, it is good to have an idea what everyone's thinking and reasoning is.<br /><br />If you do end up reading this book, maybe you'll see what I'm talking about.  Maybe you'll read Code Complete and this and like this one better.  That's why programming is awesome.
B005GVW05Q|5.0|I first saw Ryan Adams in the 1990s with Whiskeytown, and he is one of the few who lives up to his potential. Liked that band a lot, but didn't love Ryan Adams until Heartbreaker. Lost interest somewhere along the way -- not with the music, really, but with the constant new records I couldn't keep up with. And then I started missing him. Where's Ryan Adams? Gold sounded like an album that *wanted* to be a classic. This one just is, and it's beautiful. Songs are so nice, the singing is pure and free of gimmicks and imitations that would sometimes pop up in the past. Production is timeless, which means it's not whatever flavor of retro currently current.

B004EPYZOO|5.0|I had absolutely no idea what the story line would be in this movie when I got it.  All I did know was that there were American muscle cars being driven fast and some shooting between cars going on, and since I was in the mood to be entertained, I just settled in and watched the movie.  What did I get?  One heck of a great time!  Okay, this flick earned it's R rating because there was plenty of foul language, nudity and gore, but I'm a big girl and I knew what I was expecting going in.  What I didn't expect was to laugh as much as I did, because while this movie was raunchy entertainment, it was also alot of fun.    Our angry driver, Milton, escapes from Hell when his daughter is murdered and his newborn granddaughter is kidnapped and slated for satanic sacrifice by the true villain in this movie.  Milton escaped from Hell with a very special weapon called 'the god killer' and he's determined to use it on anyone who gets between him and saving his granddaughter.  While he is trying to hunt down the jackhole who murdered his daughter and stole his granddaughter, he crosses paths with a waitress in a diner, Piper, who drives a fine car with a vanity plate that says DRVAGRY.  Now, Piper can talk trash and kick butt, a take care of herself at any cost kind of girl, the sort that are few and far between in most movies where the chicks are supposed to shed their clothes frequently and wait for the hero to rescue them at ever turn.  Not so for our Piper, who catches her boyfriend poppin' some other hoochie after having quit her gig at the greasy spoon where Milton runs into her.  After her engine conveniently craps out on the road so that Milton can help her out and beg a ride, he intervenes when Piper gets into it with her cheating old man after she lays fists on the chick her old man was bouncing on the mattress with.  Milton teaches him a few things about hitting women, even though Piper landed the first couple of punches, and they hit the road.  Hot on their heels is The Accountant, who is hilariously funny throughout the movie for his deadpan character and the way he manages to intervene on Milton's behalf while still trying to take him down and return him to Hell so that his 'balance sheet' is returned to normal.  There's brawling, F-bombs and lots of driving action that keeps this movie ripping along, and underneath all the in your face action there is a theme and some moments of poignancy that made this a far more well rounded entertainment experience than I ever expected going in.  This was a great movie for pure entertainment and diversion, with action, laughter and some basic truths about right, wrong and how it all works out in the end to balance out.  I had to say that in honor of The Accountant... ;)D
B0015QT78O|5.0|This was one of my favourite shows in the 80's and definitely one of the best series of that time.  From the last research I've done it seems that the DVD Rights/license are owned by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.  If this be the case: Sony make a whole lot of fans happy and put this on DVD please!!!
B002ZG99G8|4.0|Does this smack a little of The A Team? Yes, but only in the most cursory fashion.  The action starts out early and you get a sense of who these guys are and what makes them tick early on in the movie so you know what's going to be driving the story line.  It's a winning mix of revenge, justice and just settling scores with a guy who's definitely gone around the bend and lost sight of reality in his rear view.    After their group is sent in to take out a seriously bad dude, they try to abort the mission because the guy has a host of little kids in his house, using them to sell drugs for him and knowing that the little ones will be killed, they try to stop it but there's this guy on the line and he isn't part of the team or anyone they recognize.  The guys manage to rescue the two dozen kids from the house before it's hit with an air strike, but the crazy guy on the radio has other plans and he ends up taking down the helicopter the team is supposed to be evacuating in, but The Losers aren't on board and they are now officially dead.  Now comes the time for payback and settling the score and the team does what it does best, gather intel and hunt down their target.  Along the way they acquire an ally and a traitor until the final confrontation when they action sequences are phenomenal and the outcome is particularly rewarding.  Now I won't give away the ending, but they clearly have the intentions and have laid the groundwork for a sequel, which is great news because this movie was a whole lot of entertainment packed into an hour and a half.  I will suggest that you keep watching the movie as the credits roll at the end, because you'll find yourself getting some additional scenes that you might miss otherwise.  This is a full bucket of popcorn, a box of Milk Duds and the 2 liters of soda movie that keeps you watching the action from start to finish, and it makes you wonder how the stunt guys survived filming!
B005J4ASDG|5.0|I don't care what the album title is or whether or not this is a symphony in the tradional sense.  I can say this work in six movements is like a complilation of some of the best parts of the soundtracks.<br /><br />I own the original soundtrack CDs and the Complete Recordings.  Some reviewers say this work isn't as good but I disagree.  This work is outstanding in its own right - familiar yet different than the soundtracks.  That goes for the music and the vocals.  It is a new experience.<br /><br />The music is powerful and performed very well.  I bought the digital version and it sounds great played on my .mp3 player through headphones.
B0052RCX0G|1.0|Come on.  This publisher should be smacked.  It's cheaper to kill trees, dig up dyes from the ground, print the book, package it, ship it, unpackage it, and store it on shelves than to just send me an electronic version for my Kindle?  Stupid pricing, stupid publisher.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great read. So many twists and turns keeps the reader guessing what will come next. Characters are so detailed and their personalities are wonderfully intertwined with each other. Read this book.... Read this Trilogy!!!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Best Season Yet! Loved Season One. Loved Season Two. Season Three is a new level of laughs.  The writers do an excellent job of exploiting our love for each of the characters with tiny jabs at their shortcomings.  The Special Features on the DVD continue to improve with each release.  This set includes: Takeout with the Cast of the Big Bang Theory (a discussion of favorite season 3 moments), a set tour by Simon and Kunal (Howard and Raj), and the Gag Reel.  Another Great Season of The Big Bang Theory fun to have at home on DVD to satisfy each Big Bang Whim.

B004T5K3OK|5.0|This is probably the most useful app I own. I got it on sale but it's worth the full price.  At first, I tried the free version. It was strange, I could see the potential but not how I could take advantage of it. I think the whiteboard picture example threw me off. I was treating it more like a camera then a scanner. I uninstalled it. Then a few weeks later, I saw the licensed version and read the reviews. Someone mentioned using it to scan receipts and uploading them to dropbox/google docs. DUH! Reinstalled the free version, tried it. Sure enough, it works amazingly. Picked up the paid version while on sale. Now I use it for two things, scanning sales receipts and homework assignments which I grade electronically on a tablet.  The licensed version allows you to have unlimited pdf files and to have unlimited scanned pages per pdf file. The scan quality is good for both small receipts and large letter size papers. You can even set the resolution size.   The only negative I can see is the rare occasional crash but a simple reboot of the app and I'm ready to go again.  lg thrive
B000068R1X|5.0|Ozzy Osbourne's fourth solo album Bark at the Moon was released in December of 1983.<br />After the huge loss of guitarist Randy Rhoads in a plane crash in March of 1982, Ozzy continued to tour in support of Diary of a Madman with a number of guitarists (including Night Ranger's Brad Gillis) until he found a worthy replacement in Jake E. Lee in the spring of 1983. Jake had played briefly in Ratt and Rough Cutt before teaming up with Ozzy. I have fond memories of getting this on cassette during Christmas vacation in 1983 (the cover freaked me out (as did the cover to Styx's Kilroy Was Here) but was first lesson in not judging book by the cover as this album ROCKS!!!).<br />We kick things off with the classic title track to Bark At The Moon. Jake's riffing and playing is tight and his solos are well-constructed and Ozzy's vocals ruled here (especially with the evil echo-plexed laugh and howls which was removed from the 2002 remix). The video for this song was classic featuring Ozzy in a full werewolf costume (re-creating the album's front and back cover which I admit creeped me out but as I got older, now think the costume is cool)! The next song \\"You're No Different\\" is a nice ballad and has Don Airey's excellent synthesizers and superb guitar solos from the new boy Jake (the remix has an extended ending). \\"Now You See It Now You Don't\\" is next and a decent rocker. The album's first half ends with probably my favorite track, \\"Rock N Roll Rebel\\"! Superb riff, lyrics, vocals and lead breaks from Jake and Ozzy throws in some more evil laughs after the first run of the chorus (which was removed from the 2002 mix) and I believe this is the first studio track where Ozzy used an obscene word but I didn't know what it was until I got older.<br />The second half of the albums starts with \\"Centre Of Eternity\\" which includes a cool gothic intro with a bell tolling, monks singing and a church organ before going into a full throttle rocker which speeds like a runaway locomotive. Jake plays another great solo. The album's second ballad and single is \\"So Tired\\". Ozzy sings passionately and superbly on this great song and features a great guitar solo from Jake and excellent orchestrations. This track too had a funny video of Ozzy in a theater playing all sorts of people (an old man, himself, orchestrator, etc). We then rock out again with the fast paced \\"Slow Down\\" and featured yet another great solo section from Jake and is superb! The album closes with the haunting epic entitled \\"Waiting For Darkness\\" which just rocks.<br />The album upon its release hit the US Top 20 and gave Ozzy his fourth Double Platinum album in a row (quite a feat for a rocker who was almost down and out in 1979 after being oustered from Black Sabbath).<br />In the summer of 1995, the album was re-issued/remastered with the bonus track \\"Spiders in the Night\\" which was left off the US issue of the album and is a great song. Also, Bob Ludwig's remastering here was SUPERB. Unfortunately this issue is now out of print (unless you either look on eBay or here or a used CD store or download the tracks)<br />Then in 2002, the album was remixed and re-issued with a second bonus track \\"One Up the B-Side\\" but the remix and the new mastering was awful. I say either look for original LP or CD or 1995 remaster on be it cassette and/or CD.<br />The original 1983 issue of the album and the 1995 remaster is RECOMMENDED!s another great solo.

B000000OU0|5.0|The Eagles' eighth non-compilation album Hell Freezes Over was released in November of 1994.<br />1994 was a memorable year for me as I graduated High School that year, turned 18, started college. Plus that year saw many classic rock bands make comebacks in a time of grunge and gangsta rap as Rush had their highest charting effort with Counterparts in late '93 and had a sold out arena tour, Pink Floyd returned with their classic #1 effort The Division Bell and embarked on what turned out to be its final huge sold out stadium tour, The Rolling Stones hit the road in support of their #2 charting Voodoo Lounge, half of Led Zeppelin (Robert Plant and Jimmy Page) reunited for UnLEDded(No Quarter) and The Who celebrated its 30 anniversary.<br />The Eagles, a band whom had not recorded nor toured since 1980, made their unexpected return in 1994 with the album and tour of Hell Freezes Over.<br />When I heard The Eagles were reuniting, I wanted to see them (unfortunately the shows sold out and fates turns out the last tour with guitarist Don Felder who got fired in 2001) but I did buy Hell Freezes Over within its first week and saw the MTV/VH1 special and they proved they could still rock at a time of whiner rock and violent rap and lame pop.<br />Most of Hell Freezes Over was the band's MTV special recorded and filmed in April of 1994.<br />However, the album kicks off with FOUR new STUDIO tracks. The rocking \\"Get Over It\\" was a biting Don Henley/Glenn Frey attack on reality TV which was becoming a problem (today it is even worse thanks to celebreality shows). The song kicks ass and Frey, Joe Walsh and Don Felder each get to do a guitar solo at the beginning (Frey at the intro and did one after first verse), middle (Walsh's slide guitar) and end (Felder's excellent solo) of song respectively. The song was a major rock radio hit hitting the Top 10 of Billboard's Rock radio chart. The hit ballad \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive\\" is next and bass player Timothy B Schmit sings this song and is a nice ballad. \\"The Girl From Yesterday\\" is a country song which would not have sounded out of place on either Desperado or One of These Nights. Lastly, the atmospheric \\"Learn to Be Still\\" is a great song with some excellent soloing from Felder.<br />The concert recordings actually started with \\"Hotel California\\" done in a Spanish unplugged way to give it a Mexican-reggae feel. \\"Tequila Sunrise\\" was next and was excellent. Also, \\"I Can't Tell You Why\\", \\"Take it Easy\\", \\"In the City\\" and \\"Life in the Fast Lane\\" are performed well. The tracks \\"Wasted Time\\", \\"Pretty Maids All in a Row\\", \\"The Last Resort\\" and the ending \\"Desperado\\" all were performed with an orchestra to give the tracks a fresh feel. Also, the band's version of Henley's solo track \\"New York Minute\\" was excellent as well with orchestra and so forth.<br />The band also did performances of the four aforementioned studio tracks, Joe Walsh's Help Me Through the Night and Don Henley's solo track The Heart of the Matter and Seven Bridges Road but they are on the DVD whilst Best of My Love and others were recorded but were unreleased.<br />Hell Freezes Over was a huge success and hit #1 on the Billboard 200 where it stayed for two weeks and sold a whooping 10 million copies in the US alone.<br />Recommended!ballad. \\"The Girl From Yesterday\\" is a country song which would not have sounded out of place on either Desperado or One of These Nights.

B002MT3CIY|5.0|Pink Floyd's second concert video entitled Delicate Sound of Thunder was released in June of 1989 (the satellite album was released in November of 1988) now available on DVD as Shine On - Live due to license from Columbia Music Video running out and also David Gilmour, Nick Mason and the late Rick Wright's disowning of Delicate Sound in general.<br />The album (and video) was recorded and filmed over five nights at the Nassau Coliseum in New York in August of 1988 (the end of the regular Momentary Lapse tour '87-'88 and directed by video director Wayne Isham (Bon Jovi, Rolling Stones, Queensryche, etc.).<br />The band would tour Europe again in 1989/90 in support of Delicate Sound with the tour called Another Lapse.<br />The band first attempted to record a live album and video in November of 1987 in Atlanta, GA but the band were not up to par. Subsequently, they tried again in the summer of 1988. As a result, a great live album and video.<br />The album and video has superb live versions of \\"On The Turning Away\\" and One of These Days\\". The fans' much reviled track \\"The Dogs of War\\" is superior to its studio counterpart with Nick Mason playing drums this time and Rick Wright playing on keyboards like he did in the old days (the two are the only two original Floyd members who did every tour) and of course David Gilmour's vocals and superb guitar work. The film on this track is breath taking with the German Shepard dogs running with the yellow eyes as if they were possessed by Satan himself. Other standouts are \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Learning To Fly\\". Some tracks are slightly edited like \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb\\".<br />This video features material that were not on the album like \\"Signs Of Life\\", \\"On the Run\\", a spellbinding \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" and of course the superb \\"One Slip\\". \\"Money\\" was available on only the US and Canadian video versions of Delicate Sound but not the UK edition but is here as well.<br />The video did well for a live concert video as it went Multi-Platinum and is a great document of Floyd's reunion tour.<br />I first got this video in January of 1993 and went through two copies but then got the DVD of Shine On Live and I'm happy with it.<br />Highly recommended!eo as it went Multi-Platinum and is a great document of Floyd's reunion tour.

B003Y74AXO|3.0|Not sure at what point the screen protector got a little tiny dent in it before application, but it did. I put it on carefully and it had a lot of bubbles. I used the supplied little plastic card to remove most of them, but I could not remove some small bubbles. The protector is not sticking well on one lower corner and an inch an a half along the bottom. I have a couple of mm at the top not covered so I probably should have positioned it about 1 mm higher. I can still see my finger prints on the protector, but they are a little less noticeable. At the moment this is selling for ten bucks on amazon, which seems a little high. I'm using it on an iPad 2.
B004DL5K2K|5.0|Former Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne released his first solo album entitled Blizzard Of Ozz in the United Kingdom in late 1980 and here in the United States in the Spring of 1981.<br />After being dismissed from Black Sabbath in 1979, Ozzy continued to spiral out of control until he was saved by a lady named Sharon Arden (who was the daughter of Black Sabbath's then-manager Don Arden (and eventually became Ozzy's often controversial manager and later wife)). She and Ozzy put together a band that included ex-Uriah Heep drummer Lee Kerslake, ex-Rainbow and Uriah Heep bass player Bob Daisley and a then-22 year old guitar virtuoso Randy Rhoads from Los Angeles, California all came into his life and helped his launch a solo career that would be big and yes NOTORIOUS!<br />We begin with a backwards gong effect before the sure fire riff of \\"I Don't Know\\". This is straight-up metal which featured some of the Ozzman's most memorable singing and Bob Daisley's killer lyrics. It's not at all surprising to find that this one still gets played on the radio on a very regular basis. Nice opener. Next is \\"Crazy Train\\" which is arguably Ozzy's most famous solo song ever, and once you listen to it, it really isn't that hard to see why. From Ozzy's maniacal echo-plexed opening laugh and vibra-slap to Randy's killer riff and superb vocals, I can see why this song is a classic in the rock and roll world. Next is the Ozzman's first attempt at a ballad called \\"Goodbye To Romance\\". This is one of my favorite tracks and Ozzy's vocals plus Randy's melodic rhytm playing and middle solo is amongst his best. Also, Don Airey's ending synthesizer solo sounds triumphant. The instrumental \\"Dee\\" is next and is basically a Randy Rhoads classical guitar solo and showing why he was one of rock's greatest guitarists. Next is the first half closing and possibly Ozzy's most controversial song ever \\"Suicide Solution\\". Supposedly, Ozzy whote the song as a hidden message for fans to commit suicide. In fact, it was written in tribute to Ozzy's fallen friend, Bon Scott of AC/DC, who died in February of 1980. The song supposedly contained subliminal messages of \\"get the gun, get the gun\\" and \\"shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot\\". It was acutually vocal phrasings. This song is a killer rocker with a powerful Rhoads riff and stellar playing from messieurs Kerslake and Daisley.<br />The album's second half starts with \\"Mr. Crowley\\" which is a classic metal tale about the legendary satanist Aleister Crowley and became a radio staple in later years and a favorite album track. From Don Airey's awesome opening organ-style synthesizer solo right down to Randy Rhoads' guitar solos at the end, this song ROCKS. Next is \\"No Bone Movies\\" which is a basic hard rocker from Ozzy. I have no complaints with this song whatsoever, in that I feel it is an excellent song. Also, hearing Randy perform a rare slide guitar solo was excellent. The epic \\"Revelation (Mother Earth)\\" follows and is both eerie and melodic at the same time. This song is my favorite on the album and may be a slower track, but its eerie nature and subject matter and ending solo section from Rhoads and Daisley and Kerslake keep it from being what you could call a ballad. The song, in some places musically, is reminiscent of \\"She's Gone\\", a song Ozzy recorded with Black Sabbath in 1976 on their Technical Ecstasy album. We then rock out with Blizzard's closing track the rocking \\"Steal Away (The Night)\\". This track rocks and rules!<br />Blizzard of Ozz was also a huge success commercially becoming Ozzy's first Gold album (eventually Quadruple Platinum selling album) in the US within days of its release after a controversial incident with his record label involving the biting off of the head of a live bird at the CBS Records offices but the music is why this album is timeless.<br />After a spat between Sharon and ex-Ozzy members Daisley and Kerslake over owed royalties caused Sharon to re-record all of BoO's backing tracks andre-released in 2002 with Robert Trujillo and Mike Bordin re-recording the bass guitar and drums which was sacrilegious. However in 2011, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Blizzard's US release, the ORIGINAL mix is now back in print (that mean's Ozzy, Randy Rhoads, Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake's performances are back to how it was when originally released). George Marino's remastering is superb. Also comtains the original B-side of \\"You Look at Me Look at You\\", an alternate mix of \\"Goodbye to Romance\\" and an acoustic outtake from Rhoads. If one is to buy Blizzard of Ozz, this is the version to get!<br />RECOMMENDED!<br />This original issue of Blizzard is RECOMMENDED!2002 with Robert Trujillo and Mike Bordin re-recording the bass guitar and drums which was sacrilegious.

B005HSG3TC|4.0|I find this to be of a good quality and design. If you read the description below, it is all of these things...nothing more, nothing less.   -Certified \\"Made for Kindle\\" accessory (Kindle Fire)  -Hard polycarbonate back piece with a soft protective lid for protection against scratches and impact  -Soft fabric lid folds to function as a stand for viewing  -Convenient elastic strap holds the protective lid in the open or closed position  -Reinforced corner protection  The term polycarbonate is defined as 'Any of a class of thermoplastics characterized by high-impact strength, light weight, and flexibility, and used as shatter-resistant substitutes for glass'. I'm not sure what all the people that wrote bad reviews of this case thought they were going to end up with, maybe leather? This case works well, looks nice and most importantly offers the Fire some serious protection. I have no doubt that if I dropped my Fire, it would live without a scratch. There's probably more of a chance of something breaking loose inside the device than the glass breaking or case cracking. It's nice that this case is so lightweight because the Fire is not lightweight compared to the other Kindles. I wouldn't want to hold this device for an hour with a heavier case. This case is a nicely finished, lightweight and functional case and I'm glad I bought it.
B004RQVVGU|5.0|Ozzy Osbourne's second solo album Diary of a Madman was released in November of 1981 (thirty years ago to be exact).<br />When Ozzy Osbourne released his first album after his Black Sabbath ouster called Blizzard Of Ozz (which included a stellar band including bass player Bob Daisley, drummer Lee Kerslake and the late great guitarist Randy Rhoads), he proved he could survive without Sabbath with great success.<br />In early 1981, Ozzy (plus Rhoads, Kerslake and Daisley) re-entered the recording studio to record his second solo album and pressure was on to deliver an album that was either as good as his debut or better. Would Ozzy and company deliver or would they be written off. Read ahead and find out (as I did when I first acquired the cassette in March of 1984 on recommendation after liking Bark at the Moon so much as a just turned 8 year old).<br />We kick things off with one of Ozzy's best rockers \\"Over the Mountain\\" which had one of the best rock drumming intros and a great solo work from Rhoads. Next was the album's rock radio staple \\"Flying High Again\\" which is a great number. Next is the other rock radio staple and the truth about rock music in general \\"You Can't Kill Rock and Roll\\". This near seven minute epic is about Ozzy's true love (Rock and Roll). Randy Rhoads' guitar work here was unreal. The first side closed with a great rocker out of \\"Believer\\". Great musicianship and vocal work from Ozzy.<br />The album's second half kicks off with \\"Little Dolls\\" which had another stellar Kerslake drum intro which went into a great rocker. Next is another ballad \\"Tonight\\" which slows things down a bit but still a stellar song. We follow with the rocker \\"S.A.T.O.\\" and is another winner. We close with the epic haunting title cut which featured some of Rhoads' best guitar work and superb musicianship from Kerslake and Daisley plus haunting choir and strings.<br />Diary of a Madman was yet another Top 20 smash for The Ozzman and his first Platinum seller in the US (now at over four million in US sales).<br />This album was sadly the last with Ozzy's first (and best) solo band as Messieurs Kerslake and Daisley were fired upon the album's completion and sadly Randy Rhoads whom would tragically die in a plane crash in March of 1982 whilst touring with Ozzy en route to a show in Orlando, Fla (to play a show with Foreigner).<br />I avoided the atrocitious 2002 re-issues which saw Sharon spitefully and coldly delete Daisley and Kerslake's parts and replace them with Robert Trujillo (now Metallica's bass player) and current Ozzy and ex-Faith No More drummer Mike Bordin who slaughtered this masterpiece because she would not pay Daisley and Kerslake their owed royalties for their hard work on the album. However in 2011, the album was reissued with the original performances of Kerslake, Daisley, Rhoads and Osbourne REINSTATED and brilliantly remastered by George Marino (giving the 1995 remaster a run for its money) and also comes with an extra live CD which rivals the 1987 album Tribute.<br />RECOMMENDED!million in US sales).

B0013FSL3E|1.0|I hate movies that preach to the audience.  Even worse, I really hate movies that preach to kids.  I don't mind a plot with a lesson, but I don't like a plot that is entirely a lesson.  There is a difference.  That is the essence of Wall-E.  Ignorant mankind has destroyed the environment and man had fled to space.  All that is left is Wall-E, a mechanical E.T. rip off that is a garbage collecting robot.    All the people have fled on spaceships and do nothing but indulge themselves on soft drinks and television.  They are all so obese that they can't get out of their chairs.    Translation - hey kids, we are all fat, lazy, and commercialistic.  We are destroying the environment, blah, blah, blah.    After writing this review I'm going to go throw an aluminum can in a regular trash can.  I've been inspired to pollute.  I'm also considering changing out my gas furnace and putting in an old oil tank.    You know what I miss?  (of course you do)  How about a good `ol cartoon like Thundarr the Barbarian.  That dude would run around in his beaver pelt underwear chopping things up with his sun sword.  The moral of the story?  Nothing!  Just administering the beat down!  Thundarr didn't stop to tell me I should \\"be a good friend\\" or \\"learn to share\\" or \\"don't do drugs\\".  He just found some action, yelled \\"Ariel...Ookla...Ride!\\" and opened a big `ol can on some future techno-monster mutant.    Thundarr sort of evolved into He-Man - another dude in beaver pelt undies with a sword.  How awesome is a show that begins with an intro that includes the hero punching the tv screen?  Yeah...  Plus, we get to see Teela running around - that's an added plus. Of course, He-Man would be 29 minutes of beat down and then 1 minute of \\"be good\\" message at the end.   Now we are stuck with Wonder Pets, Backyardigans, Dora the Explorer, and other lame cartoons that are 100% message.  Did you know that I'm practically Albert Eistein?  Here's the proof... 100% message = 100% sucks.    Wall-E sucks.  I just proved it.

Beth has just an intense, gorgeous voice. It's almost mesmerizing. To keep my words short, take a look at a video from their duet in NYC on 11/5/11: [...]    I bought the CD the next day after seeing this show.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Great game! Very addicting and thrilling! At first I was sceptical, but the further I went in the game the more addicted I got! I recommend this for people who love strategic games. The fighting style is much like the Final Fantasy games in techniques, for those wondering. Also, if you get stuck in the game exit where you are and check the map! ;)

1451627289|3.0|Spoilers.  I enjoyed reading this book.  I think King really kept you engaged with the characters and their decisions.  I think though, if you read any book about stopping John F. Kennedy's assassination you're going to want to see the payoff- what the world would be like if it hadn't happened.  And there is where King doesn't follow through.  He throws in the world being destroyed because of time travel.  It is being wracked by earthquakes and other disasters.  We don't see what the world would be like if Kennedy simply hadn't been assassinated.
0439023483|5.0|One of the best book I have read in a long time. I would say probably my favorite since reading The Giver in grade school. I am astounded by the depth of imagination and the social and moral questions this book raises. How far would you go to survive? and How would it change your views on humanity? This book gives you so much to think about, I found myself in awe of the mind that created such a story. Katniss is a remarkable young girl willing to sacrifice her life to save her sister and Peeta is equally remarkable in his desire to save Katniss at all costs. That a love so pure could be born of one chance encounter years before and be that strong is one of my favorite parts of the story. It pushes the boundaries of love and sacrifice and had me mesmerized the whole time. This series will be a classic that will still be read by generations to come.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Not your average puzzle game. With smooth gameplay, relaxing music, and innovative style, Quell really breaks out of the stereotypical box set for most puzzle games. Later puzzles are challenging and you will routinely have yourself thinking literally and figuratively outside of the box. I would certainly recommend this game to others.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Even-though the ads in the free version were not TERRIBLY annoying --- the ad-free version for $0.95 is a deal.  This game will not improve your intelligence, but it gives you the ability to kill time, and have fun doing it. (think Doctor's waiting room.)

I have left two different emails , with only a response to go to an other site, which is still not responding after attempted contact every 10 minites for an hour.

0553386794|4.0|I had heard that this series was the best fantasy series since Lord of the Rings. And although I own a copy of A Game of Thrones, I was reluctant to read it since Martin hasn't completed the series yet. But the new series on HBO changed my plans and I decided I better read the books before watching the series.<br />So is it the best fantasy since Lord of the Rings? Well maybe. It certainly has the potential, a lot will depend on how the other books in the series pan out. I don't believe the first book, at least, lives up to the hype. At least for me. I do think Martin is a better writer than the average fantasy author. And I do appreciate that the more adult and gritty tone of the work is a nice change from a lot of fantasy. But I have to say I prefer my fantasy with a little more of the 'fantastic' in it. Much of the book reminded me of Guy Gavriel Kay's books which pretty much take place in our world with just the names of the countries changed. Not surprisingly my favourite parts of the story concerned The Wall.<br />But having said that I did like it and I do look forward to the next book A Clash of Kings - maybe that one will knock my socks off
B002BAWIWU|5.0|I'm glad I indulged myself with this CD/MP3. I'm just now learning to appreciate George Harrison's Wisdom. Some say it doesn't span his career but there are a lot of happy wisdom filled songs and I for one am truly glad to have had the option to purchase this gem. If you are looking for his wisdom or some happiness you can find that in this CD/MP3.

030746363X|5.0|I got the book after seeing a bit on Dr. Oz and was intregued.  After reading the first basic chapters I got myself ready and got a few supplies.  I've always been a very healthy eater, regular exerciser etc but I could loose about 10 pounds to go from \\"good\\" to \\"wow\\".  One week in and I was down 6 pounds!  I hadn't started the supplements and only got one work out in, plus I haven't entirely given up milk and still lost the weight.  I feel totally satisfied, I eat when hungry and have no cravings or feeling of deprevation.  I can't imagine how easy this is and how effective.  Now I'm just curious to see how far I can go.  The reading is fast, interesting and Time writes in a sarcastic, funny way that keeps you going.  I would definately recommend to anyone who's been disappointed with not reaching their goals from the standard \\"eating healthy, exercise\\" combination.

The Power and As a Man Thinketh, and Think and Grow Rich are definitely where this knowledge has come from<br />I love it and use it daily to change my thinking habits.. no more negative responses.. it can be turned around and in words that are easy to understand and to practise.. Resonating in the subconscious and staying there to form a new pattern and a new life.
0385534639|5.0|I loved this book. It was magical, pun intended.    Celia and Marco are bound together before they even meet. They are the key players of a game. A very unusual game that no one truly understands. Because of this game Le Cirque des Reves is born and with it come a plethora of unique characters that you won't soon forget.    The writing in this book is the best I have read in a very long time. Morgenstern entrances you with her talent of description. The imagery is mesmerizing. It is like a dream, an incredibly vivid dream and sometimes a nightmare. It pulls you in until you are in the circus tent or eating the food at a Midnight Dinner. There were many time I went back and reread a passage because I wanted to feel it all again.     There were many characters throughout the story and at times it got a bit confusing. Most characters were well developed but some I wanted to know more about. The two main characters are great. You get to know them and feel the emotions. I did fall in love with Marco, though maybe that's just the girl in me.     I'm conflicted with how I feel about how the book is laid out. I found it confusing with the time jumps and switches in characters. But now I think it makes the story that much more enchanting. The confusion adds to the mystery and magic of the plot. Everything unfolds slowly but at precisely the right time. Though, I didn't see that until I finished the book.    There is so much more I want to write about The Night Circus but I don't want to give anything away and take from your own experience with the book. Just read it.    I would recommend this book to anyone who is willing to read it. I don't think you will regret it.    I believe this will go in the very small pile of books I will read over and over again.

After all, how can one food group (Carbs) and one food in particular (Wheat) really cause so many of the problems our society faces such as Obesity and Diabetes. Skepticism is a good thing, but so are results. All I can say is that my health and appearance dramatically improved after buying this book and applying its recommendations.   I had been eating relatively \\"healthy\\" according to conventional wisdom and working out 5 times a week. I wasn't in horrible health, but I didn't feel that great and couldn't get that chiseled physique I wanted. After reading the book and following the diet it lays out, I have lost about 15 pounds and my waist has grown significantly smaller all after just 2 months. I have more energy, don't have carb crashes, don't get hungry all the time, and generally feel like I am in much better health. Best of all, I am getting in the best shape of my life and am getting the toned body I couldn't before.    This isn't some expensive diet program and the only money I spent was to buy the book which details the problems with wheat and suggests an alternative diet. Frankly if you just eliminate wheat and limit carbs, you don't have to even buy the book but you might as well learn the science behind it for less than 20 bucks.   Obviously under a new wheat-free diet, you cannot eat old favorites like pizza, hamburgers, cookies, and the rest, but that does not mean you cannot eat great food. I rediscovered the wonders of nuts and cheese which you can eat unlimited in this diet and still lose weight. If you want to indulge, order a juicy hamburger and don't eat the bun or got out for a nice steak.   If you don't know if you can live without all those carbs, then ask yourself if they are worth being overweight and in poor health. Once you give up wheat and limit other carbs, you cravings for these things go away. I have gone to parties with warm Chocolate Chip Cookies and I genuinely had no desire to eat them. That is just one example of the amazing benefits you will see and learn after reading this book.  I wouldn't be recommending this book if it didn't truly change my life. Our collective health is too important to ignore this book and you will not regret reading Wheat Belly and following its wheat-free lifestyle.

1451648537|2.0|Those thinking of purchasing this book owe it to themselves to listen to the incisive review by John Siracusa at [...]. In a nutshell, Siracusa concludes that Jobs chose the wrong biographer (just as he admitted to recruiting the wrong guy, John Sculley, to be CEO of Apple in 1983), not only because Isaacson has a very superficial knowledge of the tech industry and of the technologies with which Jobs was involved, but also because he didn't even endeavor to learn about such topics which are crucial to understanding the man and in communicating to a general public the importance of his work. Siracusa demonstrates convincingly that the first half of the book poorly summarizes and analyzes readily-available sources, and the second half, which deals with the period of Jobs' return to Apple (when he became really secretive), is rife with inaccuracies and ill-informed editorializing. A terrible waste of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, as Isaacson is the only biographer who was given unfettered access to Jobs and his circle of family and associates.

B001P3OMY6|5.0|**Originally reviewed at my blog, That Artsy Reader Girl. I bought my copy from a seller other than Amazon.**<br /><br />Austenland is like Disneyland for women who secretly wish they had a Mr. Darcy of their own. I think BBC's version of Pride and Prejudice instilled a little bit of that longing in all of us.  This problem is exactly what Jane Hayes suffers with. After dating a ton of losers, this single, 33-year-old, New Yorker has come to the conclusion that no man can compare to the sexy, debonair, and utterly romantic Mr. Darcy. She has given up on the male gender completely. One day when her mother and great-aunt Carolyn come over for a visit, they inadvertently discover her copy of the movie as it shifts and falls from its hiding place in Jane's potted plant. Jane, of course, was mortified--as if they had discovered her drawer of scandalous underwear.<br /><br />Six months later, Great-Aunt Carolyn passes away and leaves one thing for Jane in her will: a non-refundable, all-inclusive, three-week vacation to Pembrook Park in England where she will strip herself of modern conveniences and live just as Elizabeth Bennett did. After some panicked girl talk with her friend, she decides to humor her late aunt and go on the trip as one last fling before giving up on ever finding her Mr. Darcy. She'll play out her fantasy and then throw her DVDs away.<br /><br />She arrives at Pembrook Park and is given a new name, a new age (in Regency times, a woman her age would be considered a spinster and unmarriageable), a pamphlet on how to speak and act, a regency wardrobe (even her purple bra is confiscated and replaced with Regency undies), and is scurried off to teatime with her cell phone hidden illegally in the bottom of her trunk. She feels a little silly at first, but soon embraces this new way of life. She even enjoys it a little! Even though it's all a game, her confidence improves and she's convinced she can finally kick this Mr. Darcy obsession to the curb. However, these dreams or hers seem to be more attainable than she thought. With all the humor, charm, and sweet romance you could expect from a Jane Austen novel, Jane Hayes is well on her way to finding everything she hoped for.<br /><br />This book had me before it even started when I read the dedication page: \\"For Colin Firth: You're a really great guy, but I'm married, so I think we should just be friends.\\" I knew I was in for a fun read. I think part of the reason I enjoyed this book so much is because I identify so much with Jane Hayes. I've had my share of frogs in the proverbial dating pond, and understand her frustrations. However... I don't hide my Pride and Prejudice DVD in a flowerpot. Hahaha. This was a fun, light-hearted read. It was very clean, obviously (since it's modeled after a clean book), and I enjoyed watching the romance unfold. Jane got herself into some funny situations and was a bit rebellious at times--sneaking out to enjoy modern technology (sounds like something I'd do). I also love that each chapter started out with a story of one of Jane's romances-gone-bad. They were very humorous and made me feel a little better about my experiences! I enjoyed the characters, the detailed descriptions, and the storyline. I laughed, I got annoyed, I chewed characters out when they were being dumb, I turned the pages in anticipation, and I closed the book with a smile on my face. Most importantly, this book helped me remember that sometimes what you need is much different than what you want or what you're looking for.<br /><br />Happy reading! I'm off to pop some popcorn and watch Pride and Prejudice! (Colin, feel free to join me. I'm not married.)these dreams or hers seem to be more attainable than she thought.

1609611543|5.0|I learned so much from the book.  It does read like a science text book, but all the facts are there with footnotes.  I have personally experienced the affects of wheat in my diet and found when removing wheat the changes were very evident.  I will pass the book on to friends and I wholly recommend it to everyone else.

I think the people givjng high reviews but be family members of Grisham. dont waste your money
B005POK858|4.0|A classic style rpg with vibrant colors, and its a lot of fun if you manage to find enough time to play.
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|Do I really need to write a lengthy review here?  Every song is excellent...  Born Free - Destined to be a staple of the Kid's live sets... Fist pumping anthem to individuality.  Great sound on this... Springsteen, Seger couldn't do it better.  Slow My Roll- Again, excellent production.  Just sounds like great rock.  Care - Come on... It's pretty darn catchy.. Even if it is a little syrupy-sweet... And Martina McBride could sing the dictionary and people would groove on it.  Purple Sky - Great road trip song  When It Rains - Ode to Joe C, perhaps? This should have been the ballad single.  God Bless Saturday - He is the new voice of the workingman, no doubts about it.  Collide - Not \\"Picture,\\" but solid in its own way.  Excellent storytelling and characterization here.  He and Sheryl work great together.  Flyin High - What's a Kid Rock album without mention of weed?  Nice collab with Zac Brown.  Times Like These - Can I get an AMEN?  Great song... Very evocative of Detroit.  Rock On - An intro that almost sounds like David Gilmour... A great vocal performance here... Whiskey and Winstons... Reminds me of Solomon Burke's later years.  Rock Bottom Blues - Southern rock/blues... Hand clappin, hip swingin, shuffle rhythm.. A little nod to Steven Tyler in the \\"kicka-ka-kow\\" vocal line.  For the first Time - Kid sings in a falsetto here. Not really sure that it works, but whatever.  STILL, solid songwriting here.  And the guitar work is perfect.  It tells a story all by itself through the outro and makes a nice closer.  In all, this is a GREAT album... But I am always saying that about stuff that others don't immediately appreciate.  If you are a fan, no reason not to get it.  If you are not a fan, let yourself be convinced.  I was never really that into KR's music other than listening on the radio, but I am now sold.  He is in great voice every minute of this and shows his total commitment to making great music - as always.  Would love to hear this album and all the others live someday.
0071762345|5.0|I thought this book was very insightful and helpful! Not only was the content understandable and relevant but it also had a very functional structure.  Each chapter had opinions and stats based on real life evidence, great stories and references and then finished up with action items and a conclusion. The book was not just informative and instructional but it also had a very personal touch.  I learned a lot about Facebook strategy and really enjoyed the client examples and personal stories! I look forward to the next book, and hope it will include some more location based and gaming strategies.
1559408855|2.0|Good art requires some subtlety, totally lacking in this film. It hits us across the face with the message, which, it turns out, was not the one intended. Absolute power corrupts? Not Pasolini's point. The Fascists were monsters? Not exactly his point. His point is, according to the extras, that consumerism is the new Fascism, reducing even human beings to mere commodities, whose function is to serve the pleasures of a few. But the message is totally subsumed and occluded by the symbolism. Further, the symbolism is vitiated by the sheer absurdities presented us. Catarina Boratto, the primary female lead, reminisces about the cast's reaction after every scene was shot: They all broke out laughing. Some of them must have thought it was a weird kind of comedy. It wasn't until they saw the final edit that they realised the kind of film they had helped make.<br />To be sure, comedy can be used to convey social or political ideas - witness Charlie Chaplin, or some of the Mel Brooks movies - but comedy was not the Pasolini's intention, which makes it a failure. Further, the consumerist message is not even hinted at in the film. In fact, one doesn't even get an anti-Fascist message from it. It is simply the corruption inherent in power and lust.<br />I thought it was worth two stars primarily because the extras were enlightening and beyond the usual DVD package.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Downloaded to my Kindle Fire and graphics, game play, sounds.....awesome for a small platform game.  Hope more like this type of game becomes available for download, I am addicted to them.
B00004YVDJ|2.0|I agree that this movie is unforgettable.  But so are some of my worst nightmares especially when I have dream paralysis.  I watch movies for escape and entertainment and ERASERHEAD is not a movie I need to see again as I do not want to escape to any setting in it.<br /><br />If you like being creeped-out in a gross kind-of-way or consider yourself \\"into\\" cinematography and enjoy discussing art house films for hours on end about what you think the director was saying or meant or the \\"message\\" he was trying to convey, then by all means watch it and discuss away.<br /><br />Reading all these reviews after watching the film does explain some things but so what?!  It doesn't make my viewing experience any better.  But then again, I did not enjoy Blue Velvet either.  There, I said it!  Another unforgettable movie that I wish I had never seen.<br /><br />So if you liked Blue Velvet or any of Lynch's shows or films, then you'll probably like this B&W film.  But if you never \\"got\\" or enjoyed Twin Peaks or Blue Velet, I would not recommend you watch it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I'm hooked.  Didn't see the HBO production, but saw the books marketed in the bookstore during its run on cable.  Picked it up a few times and decided on something else.

A wonderful mix of historical fiction and fantasy.  Off to download book two.

B002WIDRM6|5.0|I am always trying to discover new music, old and new and of all kinds and I came across this superb country group after hearing their material on the radio and after listening to this record, I am quite a fan. I used to not be a fan of country music but after Lady A and Taylor Swift impressed me so much, I have been listening to a lot of different artists in the genre from old and current. Country music really shouldn't be seperated from any other genre as far as I'm concerned, it's just as relevant and important as rock and pop music.<br /><br />This record mixes pop, country and even rock which is evident on \\"Stars Tonight\\". I really like \\"American Honey\\" and \\"When You Got A Good Thing\\". The big hits of course are \\"Need You Now\\", \\"Hello World\\" and \\"Our Kind Of Love\\". These three songs show Lady A's different styles and have even reached to fans of pop music. What makes Lady Antebellum's music work so well is the passion and emotion in which they bring out in the songs. They continue to impress with each record and should be around for a while. Great music here. I hignly recommend it.

B005SV9X22|5.0|First off I saw the Monster Ball 2.0 twice in person, I've never had so much fun at a show since I saw Britney's DWAD. Gaga is captivating, entertaining and simply amazing. I was so thrilled that she not only talks to you but makes you actually feel like she's speaking directly to you. She sings live, and sounds simply amazing the entire time. This woman is unstoppable and probably the best performer in years.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|Having read the books, I was pleased that the movies remained true to the essence of the books.  Where Part One of the final episode was at the very least depressing (although still very well written, acted and performed), Part Two was an action adventure and possibly the most mature of all the films.  As I recall, much like the books, the movies became more adult oriented as the principles grew up in each successive movie.  The Series was more or less a celebration not only of Harry Potter as the focal point and hero of the story but was also a testimony to the fact that the females in the films (Hermione, Ginny Weasley, Lana and even Molly Weasley - Ron's mother) were strong role models for the independent woman(something that J.K. Rowling was aiming for). I was somewhat concerned about the ending in the movie and was not expecting it to follow the book's ending but was pleasantly surprised that it was done quite well and again matched that of the book. After 10 years of watching these young people grow from being children to adulthood, it is sad to think that this is the last of its kind. At least I have all of the movies in my library and can enjoy watching Harry, Ron and Hermione grow up and save the Wizarding World again and again. I have the BluRay/DVD/Ultraviolet Digital Copy and since I do not load digital copies onto my PC I would not have loaded the Ultraviolet copy anyway.  Nevertheless, it is extremely disturbing and disappointing that the movie industry like others are trying to take advantage of consumers to make a few extra dollars. The movie is a solid five stars but the action of those who added the Ultraviolet Digital Copy earns 0 stars.

B003M7BLOW|5.0|if you are trying to move from the Pentium D 820 dual core to this then dont wait anymore.   Right out of the box this cpu runs great perfect for gaming or multitasking a lot of programs.   I got it with the GA-m68m-sp2 and it worked perfectly.Also i couple this with a gt 430 nvidia graphics computer for gaming and 4 GB of ram. I can be running 1080p youtube, installing a program, running microsoft word and some pdf files and this wont slow down a bit. its really good for the price.   As for gaming (please note that i dont have the best graphics card) i was able to play MW2, crysis,crysis 2, batman arkham asylum, mass effect 2, world at war or call, black ops, and many more at high to medium settings. no lag what so ever despite my not fast graphics card.   I build a computer for my friend same cpu but different graphics card ATI 5670 and he was able to have good gaming computer.   The stock cooler provided with the cpu works well it keeps the cores cool and its also quiet, but you can change it if you want.   you can overclock this a bit more but do not push it. Instead buy black edition amd cpus.  my main purpose was to use this cpu for engineering programs. I used this cpu for moderate to heavy duty CFD (Computational fluid dynamics) Gambit, fluent.As well as solidworkds and Nx modeling. Also i use mathematica and matlab. they all ran fine. I recommended if you are using engineering programs what a difference it makes.   Overall the cpu has a lot computing power for the money, if you are going to use it for gaming or engineering or even a home entertainment computer then this cpu will do best, this is not the top of the line cpu but definitely this is an amazing cpu and does the job more than i expected.

B0017YWG2S|5.0|If someone were to ask me what a warm smile sounded like, I would direct them to this album and the song \\"Aguas De Marco\\".  There is a lot of beauty and emotion in this album, something I wish more could be exposed to.<br /><br />I first discovered bossa nova when I was in my early 20's, when I was looking for piano sheet music from Ryuichi Sakamoto, and came across [[ASIN:B00006FIBO Morelenbaum (2)/Sakamoto: Casa (Tribute to Jobim)]] (an equally emotive album), which lead me down a musical road of discovery to Elis & Tom, a quintessential bossa nova album more people should own.  A little over a decade later, I can always listen to this album and, like a nostalgic childhood memory, get the same feeling or solace that \\"here is a beautiful thing\\".  It's a little hard to verbalize, but I think fellow owners of this album can appreciate it.<br /><br />If you don't buy this album, at the very least, give it a listen through the samples here or on Youtube.  There are very few who would regret that time spent.

Downloads are at least 3x's faster and uploads are about 50% faster...an amazing difference.<br /><br />Customizing your Android phone is also an area where this app shines. Being able to easily tweak the wallpaper, add a contact to your home screen for direct dialing, add a widget you've added to your phone or one in the program, or a folder to your home screen - is all accomplished with ease using this app.<br /><br />It's easy to close all the running programs or just check on the most recent ones. Being able to hide apps is nice too, although frankly, everything on my phone is PG-13 so it's not a big deal. Sorting folders by alphabetical order, latest installed first or earliest installed is a nice feature as well.<br /><br />Creating a folder within an app is a nice function. I could see where for an app like HP Print for example, you could have PDF's in one folder and photos in another. App Drawer Settings like Tab Row, App Icon labels, Grid size, Scrolling Orientation (vertical, horizontal page by page, or horizontal loop), and Locked Apps are areas worth going through when you install this app.<br /><br />Preferences for Theme Settings, Screen Settings, App Drawer Settings, Effects Settings, Operation Settings, and Advanced Settings like 'Clean Rubbish Data' are great for customizing your Android phone.<br /><br />Bottom line: Techie users will enjoy this app for its many custom settings, but everyone will enjoy the ease of use and speed it adds to your Android phone.<br /><br />Works great - I highly recommend this app!stom settings, but everyone will enjoy the ease of use and speed it adds to your Android phone.<br /><br />Works great - I highly recommend this app!

0786958731|3.0|I first played (A)D&D when it was in its 2nd Edition.  R. A. Salvatore was releasing the first Drizzt books at around the same time, so I picked the series up and have read every one of the novels.  For the most part they're great and I would highly recommend them.  This game has a lot of recognizable names, which is nice for everyone like myself who has read the books.  However, I did not find the game to be much fun at all.  Here's why:<br /><br />1) There is no role-playing.  The game is purely hack-and-slash, which is not what I look for in D&D.  It could have been ok, however...<br /><br />2) The rules are over-restrictive (and simplified from full-on D&D) and get in the way of enjoyment.  This game still has tons of rules, but they're taking components of D&D (which is far more complex) and smashing them into a single-purpose board game.  This means that you still have to spend a lot of time learning fairly inconsequential rules that are essential to the functioning of the game.<br /><br />3) There is only a single, workable strategy if you want to win: run...fast.  Because of the way the game is designed, your characters are punished for not moving at an extremely rapid pace toward the objective.  It makes the game difficult to enjoy because I spend all my time strategizing how to avoid drawing Encounter cards (which you'll become familiar with if you play the game).  The rest of the decisions you need to make in the game are extremely straightforward and simple.  Some characters only have one reusable attack option.<br /><br />Some of my friends who had never played a real RPG before had a good time with this game.  We later played a real D&D session, which they liked more.  In my opinion, this is a 2.5 star game (I bumped it to 3 because I'm a Drizzt fan and less RPG-experienced people liked it more).  I don't care to play it again, but that's because I know there's much better stuff out there.  The game appealed more to people used to playing board games rather than RPGs.  This game got uniformly good reviews in the press, but I just don't get it.y good reviews in the press, but I just don't get it.

B000KJT8IG|3.0|This movie is a holiday staple at our house, so I highly recommend it for people who enjoy a little good, old-fashioned, Chevy Chase slapstick humor.  The Blu-ray looked in parts like somebody had taken a hi-res camcorder into a movie and tried to hold it as steady as possible.  Other parts weren't as shaky, but the image quality was no better than DVD.  I'd say I'm disappointed, but my expectations weren't Avatar-level graphics.  Still, a great movie.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|The case works well.  It is very flimsy until you install the Kindle.  It covers it well and fits very tight.  The outer flap is black (it should be pink also).  It is so-so at propping the Kindle at an angle.

B004WR125O|5.0|I purchased the UWF-1 on Amazon for my TX-NR809.  At first I was a little upset that for the price of this receiver, it had no wireless.  But, when I realized how many features it already had I knew it was still a good deal.  Besides not every one wants wireless capability.  The best feature of this item is the cost.  At Amazon it comes to just under 30 dollars shipped.  Once again, Onkyo provides great value.  I think it is a B/G Wireless dongle (probably could be used on a laptop); so for that price it is a decent deal.  If your Onkyo receiver is either out of reach from your router or you just hate wires, and you have an available USB port on your Onkyo, pick this up and you wont be disappointed.
1400069181|5.0|This book is an awesome tool for people wanting to start their own business. Personally i want too so this book opened doors that can make it happen.  READ THIS BOOK! It's amazing.
1451648537|5.0|This book is super informative. I got it on a whim since Steve Jobs had been in the news so much, but I didn't expect to find it so entertaining! It is a page turner! Great story about a man who is already a legend. It is a good book even for those not into technology. Gives some insight into the late creative genius.

0385535139|3.0|Many of John Grisham's novels have been ponderous or overly dramatic, with odd dialogue and predictable plots. The Litigators is lighthearted with endearing characters (even the lawyers), realistic dialogue and a well-paced plot. I found myself rooting for protagonist David Zinc, and genuinely interested in how things would turn out. Maybe it was the Chicago setting that made the characters come alive with their Midwestern authenticity. Readers who have given up on Grisham should give this one a try.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
B0065GG2ZK|3.0|Expected something more. A little rambly, too much talk about basically foolishness (sex, girls, being faded)not enough love, which is what I liked before. I guess maybe he is not in love, but almost every song seemed a bit indifferent...just words. Maybe time to relocate to a sober mind with clear thoughts before the hype gets killed. P.S. Aubrey Drake Graham is not a gangsta rapper...and whats with all these collaborations? He doesn't need them.
1451648537|4.0|Finished Steve Jobs Biography by Walter Isaacsson. This was the first book about Jobs that I have read. In some 600 pages the life story of the really complex, many faceted person. He was the force in making the tech objects and the use of tech able to evoke a lasting personal relationship and feeling of mastery when using the tech. Reading the book was like walking the memory lane describing the arc of technologies I have used and loved thru my career.   On many occasions I felt that please tell me more, go deeper into detail but of course there needs to be limit to the size of the book. On a multitude of cases I thought that one cannot, should not act like that with another person, that is not acceptable behaviour. Book clearly was meant to tell also about the dark side of Steve.   I also could associate with his stubbornness of not accepting the advice of doctors having seen similar stubbornness close at hand. It still felt like watching a tragedy in a theater - the doom is inevitable, why does the main character not do the right thing, easy to say from the sidelines.  On the other hand the vision, passion, drive, system thinking, design thinking, focus and the attention to the detail to get the end result perfect was admirable... Without Steve the technology world would have been much duller place. Thanks, Steve
B004LWZW24|5.0|I love movies in the horror/thriller genre; however, lately many of the horror movies have been so-so at best. This one was amazing, though! I was surprised. Very creepy, had sort of a Poltergeist feel in my opinion(a great classic horror particularly when it first came out), but I loved it. One of the best newer horror movies out there.
B0063IH60K|2.0|Plays only one style of solitaire, waste of app space. Replaced with app that offers many different styles of game play - much more interesting! Other than that, cards didn't look extra sharp or anything special compared to other apps that do more. Ads were for other apps, showed on screen by themselves. Nice they didn't clutter screen during game play with banner ads. I just don't picture myself loading individual apps for each style of solitaire game.

[[Edit]]  Okay used this for a month now and I take it back.  its not picking up dirty fingers on the white as bad as I first felt it was and I do like it.

B005HSG3U6|5.0|As I waited for my case, I read all the reviews that had been posted. I, like several others, began to just wait for the package to arrive only to send it back out again. However, I was surprised that this case is actually great. To address a few issues that I see some people talk about:  1. The price change: I ordered this case when the price was $39.99. I was a little upset to see that the price had dropped to $29.99 but Amazon sent me an e-mail stating that the price change occurred and I received a $10 credit to my account.  2. The stand: It works. Sure, if you are sitting around trying to make an empty case stand up, it won't do it. But put something in it.. like a Kindle Fire, maybe?.. and it works. I've set it on the table, it worked. I've set it on my bed, it worked.   3.The elastic strap: I've read where people are complaining that it is glued on which automatically makes it flimsy. It's not flimsy. It does it's job, whether it's glued there or not.  I read a review that said the edges are sharp- couldn't be farther from the truth.  Honestly, I think people are upset with the cover that folds in half. In my opinion though, if you were to drop your Fire (with the screen down), I don't think it will break--because the actual case (Hard polycarbonate back piece) is protecting it.
1401203078|3.0|Sometimes in an ongoing series, it becomes apparent that what the reader thought and what the author intended are increasingly diverging. You can't fault the author - the direction was probably what he intended all along. You can't fault the reader - he enjoyed the beginning stages without knowledge of what was to come. I like this series a lot, but it's becoming increasingly ... odd. There's the straightforward tale but the addition of other styles seems pretentious and show-offy. Plus I have a growing feeling I need master's degrees in many different subjects to keep up with the allusions. It's all losing me.
B0060V1WJ6|2.0|I watched this movie because of all the good reviews and I love Steve Carell. He should have stayed in his office at Dunder Mifflin. I have yet to like any movies he's been in. Not that I'm blaming him for the two hours of crap I just watched. I liked all the actors but the story was poorly written, in fact the idea itself was junk. They could have sent a clearer better message. I got bored as the same old parts of alcohol and girls with no respect for themselves dragged on. Ninety percent of the jokes were dirty which IMO are never creative, not funny and just plain gross. I agree with another review that said the whole son bit should have been taken out. Shudder. Why do I always waste my money on the dumb movies? But please by all means, if you like uncomfortable dirty jokes, lame uninspiring dialogues, and a bunch of people sleeping around, watch this. Sadly I know many of you out there will.
0743298039|3.0|A book about books and the nature of telling stories and secrets. I liked it. It was slow at first, but then I got lost in the story. It had a style I'm starting to notice more and more - the book was set in modern day but aside from some necessary technology, the setting, plot and characters are reminiscent of turn-of-the-century books. Maybe it's a lingering effect of Austen's popularity.
B00002N9ER|5.0|Used this mounting system for my 3D cell Maglite and worked perfect. Alignment is key to having a proper mount. The clips are tight and hold the Maglite without sliding or movement.
B000QUCNOK|4.0|This is one of those movies that, until the last 20 minutes or so, I really liked. Then my dislike of that last 20 minutes or so ruined the preceding 2+ hours. I think it's because I can't reconcile the pure love and joy felt by those exposed to the perfume with the evil that went into making it. If I had been insanity, I could have accepted it, but the movie closed that loophole. Yet I keep thinking about the movie, turning it over and over in my mind so there must be something there.
0374275637|4.0|I am an economist. I was astonished by the developments in psychology that sheds light on the understanding of cognition, decision making and behavior. This book fills a gap in our understanding of how decisions are being made by our mind, how our mental processes might be affected by stimuli we are not even aware of and how our instantaneous cognitive impulses might be biased or misleading and decided outside our conscious reasoning process.
0553381695|4.0|The second installment shows the first signs of sprawl. A lot is happening and there seem to be major players who needed more introduction while some plot points seem extraneous. Just when you start to enjoy one point of view, the chapter ends and you're on to something that you don't care about. Then you cycle through a bunch of characters before hopefully returning to a favorite only to be pulled away again. It's a hallmark of this series that at times annoys and at times works really well.The overall story though is strong enough to keep you going.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|Not sure what I expected, but the movie surpassed it. it took me a bit to incorporate the subtitles, but this is one of my favorite movies now. top 50? Don't know, but the futility and inevitablility of parts of the story plus the surprises in others make it a worthwhile movie. I love the idea of a \\"good man.\\"
B00466HM28|5.0|I did a lot of research on Amazon, Youtube, and forums and had this compared to a couple other keyboards and went with this... glad I did. It's light weight, easy to travel with, and hella easy to use.<br /><br />The keys are a bit smaller but doesn't really matter when making beats or keying something in. The pads are okay with sensitivity but I've seen some guy's take them out and lay some electrical tape on the pad sensors and then it pops. If you're just starting out this will get it done and take you beyond. You don't need software and works with Ableton, FL, Garageband, Reason, Traktor, Logic, ProTools, and a bunch others.<br /><br />There's a Facebook group[...] for users of the Akai MPK Mini where we share beats, tutorials, and all kinds of stuff. Bruh Luuh put it together and he's got a lot of stuff in there... real sick stuff that helps out. Bruh, thanks bro for all you've done!
6305428522|4.0|The movie does a good job of capturing the time period. Some of the criticism I read about the story felt the movie blamed van Doren's relationship with his father for why van Doren cheated. I didn't see that. i saw a man who made a decision that didn't seem to matter that then spiraled out of control. There's also the question of whether what NBC et al did was wrong. The show was entertainment and I wouldn't have watched a game show I knew was rigged, but I can understand the business decisions behind it.

You think they would have fixed this by now, its been months!!! My advice would be to download it while its free in hopes that they fix it in the future so you dont have to pay for this dog in the future, only to find out that they DIDNT fix it.
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|I purchased this Kymera Magic Wand Remote Control as a gift for my daughter for Christmas.

As usual, using my Prime account it came quickly and arrived in good shape.

0062112430|2.0|This book is definitely not a 5-star read. I was not overly impressed by Oliver's writing style: yes, it was good, but I wouldn't call it \\"beautiful prose\\". This book was lacking for me in several ways. First of all, none of what happens in the book is interesting unless it involves Alex, Lena's lover. All the parts where it is just Lena, or Lena and her family, or Lena and Hana, are extremely tedious and hard to get through. There are only a few exciting parts in the novel, the rest is just filling. I found myself wondering at many parts was it necessary to include this. People who are comparing this book to the Hunger Games are crazy. This book is NOWHERE near as good or exciting as the Hunger Games. The only similarities are that they are both dystopian novels. That's where it ends.   I gave this book three stars for the following reasons  1) Th idea of love being a disease is a fabulous one. I think that Oliver could have done a better job of explaining how the world came to be this way, and there was some serious lack of understanding when it came to the deliria, but the concept was a brilliant one.  2) The scenes with Alex did make the book. I think that if Alex was removed from the novel, not a single person would pick up this book to read it. Lena on her own is a nobody. She's way to indecisive for my liking, and she is literally nothing without Alex.  3) The surprise ending leaves room for an exciting second novel in the trilogy (I hope Oliver puts some more action into this one because I was barely hanging on for the first one)  I would not recommend buying this book. I would get it from friend who has already bought it or from the library. I thought it was good enough to borrow but not good enough to buy. If the second novel starts out like this first, I definitely will be giving up on this trilogy. It's an interesting idea, but there are too many things lacking for it to be enjoyable.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|I had originally purchased a Sony BT transmitter here on Amazon --<br />[[ASIN:B000XRW09Y Sony Bluetooth Wireless Transmitter for iPod (Black)]]<br />and thought it was OK, as it paired fine and held the BT handshake reasonably steady and for decent distances. I would have kept it for headset use, but I also have a set of outdoor speakers connected to an external amp, with an iPod paired via BT with the amp. I was disappointed to learn that the Sony BT dongle would not allow local volume control from the iPod, so I'd need to constantly go back to the amp to control volume. Oh well . . .<br /><br />Then I saw this Kokkia i10s dongle offered here on Amazon.<br /><br />Some of the reviews for this dongle (and its white version) indicated that it included a local volume control.<br /><br />Indeed, the Kokkia website also states the following:<br /><br />\\"(1) i10s includes an Apple Authentication chip that will authenticate with iPod/iPhone/iPad. This authentication process enables local volume adjustments on the iPod/iPhone/iPad to change the volume at the remote receiver. Sony iPod Transmitter does not have an Apple Authentication chip and because of this there is no local iPod/iPhone/iPad volume adjustment possible to change the volume at the remote receiver.\\"<br /><br />Sure enough, this is exactly the case, and the Kokkia i10s allows me to change volume right from the iPod. That being the case, the Motorola dongle was returned to Amazon.

B0026OE2NY|5.0|As the other viewer put it, indeed a very rude awakening. All the credits to the producers of this documentary. Absolutely remarkable stunning visuals combined with fantastic background score alongside good narration. It conveys the imminent dangers that we humans have brought upon ourselves by the continuous non-stop exploitation of mother earth and each and every natural resource.   Only a blu-ray can do justice to this outstanding work.   An eye opener for each and every one of us - an absolute must see for the worlds governments.
B004R1Q2EG|5.0|I have just finished Part II of this book and I love it. I just don't know at this stage if my evaluation is based on a system 1 (spontaneous, intuitive) or system 2 (rational, reflective) thinking or maybe a combination of both. I may be under the influence of a priming or a halo effect knowing that this is Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner, writing. The trickiest thing I feel like doing as I continue my reading is to assess whether Kahneman's conclusions are the result of system 1 or system 2 thinking. Arguably it is all system 2 thinking given that the book is based on research results. However, as Kahneman himself argues, system 2 is not immune to system 1's influence. The two are interdependent. I suppose this has always been the main challenge of validating research results: eliminating the biases and misperceptions of system 1.<br /><br />What I like most about the book at this stage is that it makes Kahneman's science accessible to the general public.  I find it engaging. It engages my own system 2 thinking. And that is a good thing.
B003L77G06|4.0|This is one of the best shows on TV right now and everybody has a great acting chemistry with each other. I will never be able to find a \\"reality\\" show as entertaining as good old-fashioned scripted performances, be they live-action or animated. Phil is easily the funniest on the show, with Cam a close second. I just can't look at Ed O'Neil and not think Al Bundy, and I'm sure that's the case for many people. That in no way takes away from this show but Married With Children is a classic, and I'm sure will have more seasons under its belt than this show will. The biggest problem(s) with this show IMO is Luke, the kid just can't act, or to put it more accurately he OVER acts. He tries to be this semi-retarded (sorry not PC) yet still innocently funny and it just doesn't work out for him. Maybe in future seasons he will have matured a bit more and this behavior will stop. Another aspect that has bothered me, for nearly every show in the last few decades, is why does everything have to take place in either LA or NY? This question isn't related to the show per se, but there are other parts of the US and the world besides those two places and it would be nice to see them more often.
0446573019|5.0|In \\"Zero Day\\" David Baldacci introduces Army CID (Criminal Investigation Division) investigator John Puller, who is tasked with solving the murder of Colonel Matthew Reynolds, an employee of the Defense Intelligence Agency and stationed in the Pentagon, who is murdered in a small house in West Virginia--along with his wife and two teenage kids. Puller is partnered with the local detective, Samantha Cole, as they work to uncover the secrets held in the small West Virginia town--and face a second murder.   The most interesting part about this story wasn't just the mystery, but the characters. Drake, West Virginia (the town where the action of this story takes place) is full of them. There's Roger Trent, the town millionaire who owns the only big business in the area, and holds a couple of secrets of his own. There's Bill Strauss, Trent's number two, who appears to be playing a game of his own. His son Dickie appears not much more trustworthy himself. There's Jean Trent, Roger's gold digging wife, who knows their financial security is not what it seems. There's Larry Wellman, a murdered cop who saw too much. There's Howard Reed, the mailman who discovered Reynold's murdered family. Then there's Molly Bitner, one of the victims circulating in Puller's mind, a secretary who worked for Trent, and had a meth lab in her basement--along with her friend Eric Treadwell.   The mystery itself is organized in a complicated way--with plenty of puzzle pieces, plot changes, and action. While John Puller may at first seem like a stereotypical lead, the back story Baldacci develops for him (war hero father, John's namesake and past war hero who had lost his wits, and his brother Robert, sentenced to life in jail for treason) gives him some depth and makes him a sympathetic character. The one thing that stood out to me the most, though, was the amount of research put into his book. With the amount of information incorporated into the story, you aren't just reading about Puller--you'rebasically living his military life. Overall, a well-researched, sophisticated, mystery.

B004LROUNG|3.0|I am hanging in with Grisham but fear the next few books. I read this one on audio. It felt as if I already knew the characters and the plot felt familiar. I fear he may be running out of steam. If you have never read one of his books you will enjoy this one. If you have read the others you have already been there, done that. It will be interesting to see what he comes with next. I am getting a little nervous.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|I like buying BluRays that come with an iTunes copy, I get the HD BluRay and then the iTunes copy which is easy to add to iTunes and then effortlessly works on AppleTV or any iOS device.  I'll pass on any BluRay that comes with an UltraViolet copy and just buy my digital copy directly from iTunes.  Oh yeah, saw the movie in the theater, AWESOME movie.
1451627289|5.0|I'm only about 1/5 of the way through this book...but if I could put my life on pause and JUST read this book?  I would.  It's that good.  It's as if Stephen King decided to give me an early Christmas present...the ultimate \\"What If?\\", with sprinklings of characters from previous books and with a healthy dose of literary addictiveness.  I will update this review when I finish \\"11/22/63\\" - now?  I have a book to read!
B004LUS390|5.0|Far exceeds expectations!  Can actually make accurate drawings on a phone! The ui is extremely well thought out and refined.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I purchased this to sync with my Google Calendar, which I've used on my desktop for years.  I run 6 separate calendars for our very busy family and I can now see all of them on my Kindle Fire whether I have WiFi or not.  I'm very happy with this product.
B00518HBD0|4.0|I have been a 3 Doors Down fan from the first album. If you have been also then you will not be dissapointed nor surprised by this offering. The formula is there and TDD does not break from it very much. It's just a good rock album as all of them have been. I doubt that the fan base will expand because of this album but they certainly won't lose any fans over it. These guys have settled into their comfort zone long ago and know what they are doing and seem to have fun doing it.  Simply put, if you have bought their past albums then buy this one. If you are not a fan and know little about this band, I suggest picking up their first album which has the hit Superman on it and give it shot. You'll probably be hooked and start buying the rest in short order.
B001DSNEJM|4.0|Never heard of this movie and rented it on Netflix - very pleasantly surprised.  The movie keeps you engaged, interested and has a satisfying ending to the movie.
B001FB0WBK|5.0|Love this dvd. High quality and all \\"Tommy\\". You will enjoy the spirit of Tommy watching the love he puts into his performance. He and the guitar are \\"one\\".
B003TJR2HS|5.0|This CableJive dockStubz works great with my new iPhone 4S and old Bose sound dock. The phone charges and I don't even have to remove my silicone case. The phone feels fairly stable on the converter, but I also bought a RadTech ProCable Dock Extender 19-Inch Cable to make it easier to use the phone while attached to the converter. The whole combination works well.
1451627289|3.0|3 stars. It sucks to have to type a review in order to rate an item to get recommendations now that they've taken that feature away. If it irritates you to have to read this, tell Amazon.com to bring back the \\"rate this item\\" feature on every product page.
B00008LOS1|5.0|I was lucky enough to see The Who in July of 1971 at the Forest Hills Tennis Stadium in NYC on the Who's Next tour & it is still the GREATEST Concert I've been to out of the 600+ shows I've seen. The show was before the album was released so I can't even begin to tell you the thrill of hearing songs like Baba O'Rielly for the first time, and nothing could compare to hearing/seeing Won't Get Fooled Again with Daltrey doing his patented scream, Moon, who was then the best drummer in Rock before he became a victim to his own celebrity of booze & drugs, propelling the band, Entwhistle AKA Thunderfingers, who single-handedly transformed the bass and Townshend who's acrobatic guitar playing had my jaw on the floor, diving across the stage at the end of the song - AMAZING!   So here's the album in all of its glory complete with outtakes & a show from Britain that was to be a part of the aborted Lifehouse project which to my mind & ears would've certainly eclipsed The Who & Townshends other Rock Operas - Quadrophenia and Tommy. Lifehouse, and not the Beach Boys Smile, is truly the Great Lost Album of Rock'n'Roll (although another \\"Great Lost\\" album is of coarse The Great Lost Kinks Album & will someone PLEASE rerelease it) and if you can still find it you should get Pete Townshend's Lifehouse Box & spend a Glorious Day of earful delights listening to it along with the Deluxe version of Who's Next!
B004QNN1UI|5.0|I love this Simply Red cd/dvd....the cd is crystal clear and the concert makes me feel as if I were there that night at the Sydney Opera House!  Sorry Mick Hucknall never made this tour come to Detroit!  I would have been there for sure!

B004LUS390|5.0|I have tried this app many times in trial mode and have been tempted many times to buy it. Thank you Amazon for offering it up. Brings out my inner artist and provides most any tool the mobile artist could want. Sophisticated interface is surprisingly easy to use. Love it!!
B0024FADAQ|5.0|I had seen this movie years ago when it first came out, and I really enjoyed it. So I bought it for my grandkids now that they are old enough to relate to it, and they really enjoyed it too.
0553288105|4.0|Very interesting novel. The science was a bit over my head and apparently fairly accurate (in the sense of theories and accuracy). This book- written over thirty years ago- still has some resonance in our times. The theories are just as fair as any we have for our existence. I enjoyed the \\"para\\" world and its inhabitants- in fact this was my favorite part of the book.  The book is not without its flaws, but for a fan of science fiction it was pretty good. As this is my first Asimov novel I can't compare it- but it does make me want to read more of his stuff.
B00003CXDD|5.0|This is a movie I enjoyed when it first came out, and bought it for my grandkids and they really enjoyed it too. They really liked the magic and the story behind it.
0385732554|4.0|This is a short read and listed as YA but don't let that fool you. It packs quite a punch in imagining what a world would be if everyone was the same. And if everyone was the same what would happen if you were faced with knowing the world had differences. It would be akin to describing color to the blind or music to the deaf. If we were all blind and deaf the scariest part would be seeing and hearing for the first time. Our brains would have difficulty in comprehending and processing the new stimuli. This is the dilemma our main character faces.  The aspect that frustrated me was that the way this world came about was never really explained but I can forgive that because it wasn't the focus of the story.  Spend a couple hours to read this little gem. It is well worth it.
B005F3XV62|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie.  Expecting a silly, sophormoric comedy, I had many laugh-out-loud moments and was entertained throughout.  Was it silly?  Yes, some of it was.  But I would watch it again!
B000002H6C|4.0|Metallica's history is well documented. Also their history leading up to this album, I'm sure has been documented by other reviewers on here. they brought in a new bassist. Then they went back to work, and recorded their last great album. Their last thrash one until 2008's Death Magnetic which was real producer's nightmare.  This album doesn't compare to the previous 2, which is a REALLY tough thing to ask. That being said it manages to continue to change in sound from their previous work, while still maintaining their core style. Overall I really like this album, but I forget how good it is until I actually listen to it. I'm getting over that fact, but there are little things, I can't put my finger on, that bug me about this album. Maybe some of the songs are longer than they should be. I don't know. Either way it's a fantastic album, and really shouldn't be expected to be as great as the 2 previous albums. It's hard to write an album as good as this even, much less 2 that are even better than this.  the style isn't quite as thrashy as the previous work. The songs are up tempo, but usually only have moments of thrashiness. There is a ballad, as they did on the previous 2 albums. I can already hear a shift in sound. Luckily it didn't hurt this album. However, there is definitely a transition to the self titled album, that can be heard here. Granted, it would still sound like it'd be a few albums away from that one. But whatever.  Blackened 9/10 fades in to start the album. This is a fast paced thrasher, and a great way to start the album. Nice riffs and a good chorus. Lots of Hetfield yelling. For some reason I forget the greatness of this song until I hear it.  And Justice For All 8/10 starts with a dueling guitar part mixing clean and distorted guitars. There's a nice riff in the verses. Overall this is an up tempo metal song with some nice moments, but it drags on a little longer than perhaps it should. Still a very solid track, and one every Metallica fan shouldenjoy.  Eye Of The Beholder 10/10 is my favorite song on here. Love the vocals, the riffs, everything. It's an up tempo metal song, as well, and a definite must hear. Very solid chorus as well.  One 9/10 everyone knows this song, mostly soft with a thrashing otu metal part at the end. This is another highlight for me. Pretty depressing, but otherwise it's a good song.  The Shortest Straw 8/10 is another pretty good song. The verses are faster than the past few songs, not Fight Fire With Fire, but faster. The chorus is a little weak, but not too bad. It's still pretty good.  Harvester Of Sorrow 8/10 has a cool clean guitar riff in the intro. This one's one of the slowest songs on here, still heavy though. It might be slower than One. Still it's a good song, with some really nice riffs.  The Frayed Ends Of Sanity 9/10 has a few tempo changes in it. It has a great chorus. The verses are up tmepo with some slow changes in there.   Dyers Eve 8/10 is mostly a thrasher. This is easily the fastest song on the album, too bad they didn't mix it in the middle of the album for a tempo variety. But oh well. Still it's a good closing track to end a very good album.  There's also an instrumental, but I'm not a fan of instrumentals. It's ok I guess.  Overall this is another classic album by Metallica. It'd be the last I really like, although I do enjoy songs from each of their folliwing releases. Still this is a heavy metal fan's must own. You won't be disappointed.
B0068G6M8E|5.0|This one has everything. Lots of people getting shot, mayhem galore. Not to mention that there's probably one of the biggest plot turning points of the entire season.   I read that SoA is coming back for Season 5, but after watching this episode, I have to believe the writers are going to be working overtime.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I can't stress enough on how much I love this app. Try it to believe it. It's a truly smart application. I can just type the first letter of the word and it gives me the three best recommended words to click on. I typed this whole message by using minimal keyboard. Remembers all common phrases and patterns of speech. Highhhhhly recommended!
B004LUS390|5.0|Real nice app, hard on small screen, but I guess that's my problem, not yours, good app overall, I'll try to use a lot
B005JLN9ZI|4.0|If you liked the first album you will like this even more. If you hated the first album you will probably hate this one. Plain and simple. Drake has grown and it shows. There is still a lot of singing but the songs are better. Thats bout it.
B004T5R2HQ|3.0|I have Samsung Epic 4g and some pics are unreadable with perfect conditions. Husband has Samsung Dart T499 and he cannot even dowload the app, says incompatable. That COMPLETELY sucks because that was a main reason we bought him a smart fone to be able to use this app for work papers to get paid. I am sorry I wasted the money when 2 out of 5 papers still had to be scanned on the computer. Try another FREE app first!
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|There is no excuse for this.  Metallica finally record metal again after years in the alternative wilderness, and the disaster that was St Anger, and now ? Now they've produced what sounds like a bunch of bad demos from a poor Metallica cover band, rambled over by a drunken hobo with all sorts of sexual dysfunction.  I hoped they were kidding, but, no, the joke is on us.
B004UBM4TA|5.0|This was my first 3D title that I bought.  Wow, the images the disc provides are absolutely beautiful.  You couldn't ask to be any closer to Hubble.  The video documents several repair efforts that astronauts have made over the years as well as images the telescope has captured.  There are several scenes from within the space shuttle (and out) all in beautiful 3D.  While I bought the disc for the 3D content, I actually thought the content was well documented and informative.  I enjoyed the sound and video effects of the space shuttle launches too, stereo system was rumbling the place as if you were actually there!  One suggestion though, I wouldn't suggest you buy the disc from the resellers here as it is insanely marked up.  I was able to find it for about half the price at Bxxx Buy or Wally world.

B002BWP49C|4.0|\\"[[ASIN:B001UV4XFG The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]\\" ends dramatically with Bella (Kristen Stewart) accepting Edward's (Rob Pattinson) engagement ring along with a promise to wax eternally immortal with him before she adds any more visible years to her already painfully virginal and vaguely melancholic eighteen.  As a heroine for the early 2000's, Bella epitomizes the sorrow and confusion of a generation that is well familiar with the breakdown of the traditional family, could Google whatever they think they need to know about just about anything on the Internet and questions their parents' attitudes about being able to do it all, 24-7, without flipping out or being under the care of a permanent life-therapist.  No wonder she opts to join a well appointed, financially secure vampire pride--why contemplate an uncertain future when you can live forever off the spoils of family money, never worry about employment, career or heath care?  Why not pledge to be faithful through sickness and in health when the only illness encountered will be an occasional thirst for Type O or Type A?  Sure, the Volturi could swoop down, either twist some necks or peck their hungry beaks into still-human family members, but hey, that's what being ultimately \\"connected\\" really means--especially when you have a pack of huge wolves and infinitely strong bloodsuckers as your front and rear guard.  Director Bill Condon understands Bella's choice.  He opens \\"Breaking Dawn: Part 1\\" with our about-to-become-a-vampiress BFF tottering on wedding-white high-heeled stilettos (she switches them out for tennis shoes to still relate to the klutz-contingency in the audience) to ascertain that Bella is still on pretty shaky ground despite the promise to live happily ever after.<br /><br />\\"Dawn\\" has its moments of action-packed excitement, filmed in the gloaming under the light of a seemingly faraway full moon that barely illuminates snarling computer-generated wolves battling for alpha supremacy or attacking the hungry Cullen clan intent on protecting Bella for what seems like a breach in the famous Northwest wolf-vampire treaty.  However, the main thrust of this installment is not driven by the rivalry between Edward and Jacob (Taylor Lautner) anymore--Edward, after all has won his fair maiden and seems prepared for such a life altering maturity even his randomly skewed hair has settled down to a smoother domestic bliss despite the film's major predicament--this Twilight chapter is re-dedicated to Bella who like a fractured-fairytale Sleeping Beauty finally awakens to her true desire and tells the rest of the 21st century world to virtually blow itself to oblivion.<br /><br />Stewart plays the role comfortably with as much vulnerability and sensitivity as she admirably did in \\"[[ASIN:B000A7Q2I2 Speak]].\\"  The other characters dance to her tune--most notably showing growth is Lautner, who despite moments of un-shirtedness and glimpses of taut muscle seems more believably angry and sarcastic rather than just a beefcake spouting lines of unemotional dialogue.<br /><br />As \\"Dawn\\" includes sensitively handled marital consummation (Edward demonically destroys the bed) and some pretty horrific vampire-birthing sequences, parents should see the film ahead of time to see if it meets with their standards and those that they wish to teach their pre-teens.  With that in mind, understand that the overall tone of the film wafts with the same melancholy as the other three previous installments--post-honeymoon Bella spends the rest of the film looking gaunt and drained as she stubbornly sticks to her moral guns and her \\"baby\\" sucks away at her life's blood.<br /><br />The concept of \\"imprinting\\" is reintroduced to the audience but is not explained as fully as it can be.  Perhaps a flashback of the Sam, Leah and Emily episode would explain Jacob's future experience at the end of the film with more clarity for those who have not read the novels.<br /><br />Thereturn of Carter Burwell's moody music--most notably the lyrical \\"Bella's Lullaby\\" --underlines Bella's journey from girl to woman especially in the climatic montage, in the psychologically-fueled nightmares prior to the wedding and the dreamy honeymoon sequences replete with moonlight and pillow feathers.<br /><br />Bottom Line?  Director Bill Condon does author Stephanie Meyer's \\"Breaking Dawn\\" justice in this the first of a one-two punch conclusion of the Twilight Saga films. In this Bella, Jacob and the Cullens ward off the werewolves and biology, quick thinking and genetics does the rest.  \\"Dawn\\" is just an ordinary episode in the life of anti-heroine Bella Swan Cullen who totters into marriage and motherhood while philosophically eschewing her prolonged 21st century identity angst.  No fans of the series will be disappointed--however this reviewer recommends seeing the first three films first.

B000V8I2QU|2.0|The music is fair but the sound is like a billygoat running over jam tins. The tendency for Bruce to \\"over-project\\", almost like overacting, has done his voice no favours over the years. Many times he sounds strained and hoarse in concert and on disc. The songs are OK, not great. It seems his last great album will be The Rising.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|Despite many negative reviews, we bought the Zoom based on some of the positive reviews. Glad we did! I bought the Xbox 360 w/Kinect & the Zoom on the same day from different vendors and by chance, they were delivered on the same day, so we have never...not...used our Xbox w/o the Zoom. It was easy to set up/calibrate - very easy...Since we have a 72\\" TV in a smaller room, the Zoom made the difference between being able to use our new Kinect or not. We would never move couches and rearrange our room every day in order to do our daily workouts - ain't happen'in, crisis averted...Btw, our Kinect camera is about 26\\" off the ground. The Zoom will always be on the Kinect, although it only takes a split second to remove it, slightly longer to attach it - lining it up left to right - SIMPLE!!! Fyi, the Zoom is just a series of magnifying lens(one unit...) that snap on the Xbox Kinect camera. Not much too it, but it is a great idea and vital for situations like ours...I'm not sure why so many people are having problems with this. My guess is that some of these reviewers have problems with many of the things they buy...(draw your own conclusions...). My advice: if you think you need this, get it. The price is right.   Btw, the aftermarket \\"privacy\\" covers for Kinect cameras will not fit if you have a Zoom on your camera - this should be obvious...A PHD isn't required to improvise. Maybe some genius will make one for Zoom owners, while others will just use a black sock or hankie...Whatever it is, we are feeling sort of creepy w/ this camera pointing at us while watch TV, Netflix, ect. so we are currently turning it to the side while not in use. If we can find a cover, we may just pony up another $20 for a piece of black plastic...What's another $20? (sarcasm)
B002SAS26E|5.0|Jaipur is an excellent game - part trading coins, part cards, part strategy, part luck. My 8 yr old and 10 yr old love it and can play it together but I am always happy to play with them as well because it's fun for adults and kids alike.

1451648537|5.0|Steve Jobs' life could well be summed up in a famous claim attributed to Julius Caesar, \\"I came, I saw, I conquered.\\" Because, in reading Isaacson's book, one gets the impression that Steve Jobs in his relatively short life seemed to be in a rush to \\"change the world.\\" By mastering the art of marrying creativity and engineering, he adapted cutting-edge technologies to simplify life for mankind. In doing so, as Isaacson points out, Steve Jobs transformed (conquered, if you will) six major industries:  1. Personal computers  2. Animated movies  3. Music  4. Phones  5. Tablet computing  6. Digital publishing  While the impact of these transformations were significantly greater in the B2C world of movies, music and phones; he also created enormous trend-setting influences in the B2B domain of computers and digital publishing.  In keeping with the Julius Caesar metaphors, I am reminded of another great quote from Shakespeare's play on the life of the Roman emperor, in which Mark Antony grieves after Caesar has been slain, \\"The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interred with their bones.\\" In reading Isaacson's book, I got the impression that the reverse of this quote was true in the case of Steve Jobs - some of the \\"evil\\" personality traits that Steve displayed during his short life will soon be forgotten, but the tremendous good that his professional endeavors bestowed upon the world will live on forever.  Isaacson made much about Steve Jobs and his \\"Reality Distortion Field (RDF).\\" Every time I came across this nebulous concept in the book, I couldn't help think that by definition \\"reality distortion\\" is an oxymoron. RDF is a mind-bending exercise that is typically associated with people who experiment with hallucinogens and/or practice intensive meditative techniques. Steve indulged in both of these activities and this probably convinced him that he had the will power to make subordinates and colleagues achieve the impossible. But as the old saying goes, \\"it takes two to tango,\\" and Steve couldn't have been a leader of the RDF cult, if he did not have willing followers. The bottom line is Steve used RDF for the public good - he led them to create insanely good products and did not get them to just drink the Kool-Aid. In any event, this is not a management style that I would recommend because it is not one that can be taught - some chosen few are born with it and Steve Jobs was one of them.  From a marketing standpoint, if there is a single most appealing characteristic of Steve Jobs that stands out in Isaacson's book, it is the one that gave him an ability to so seamlessly intersect art and engineering in a superior fashion, which can be seen in every product from the first Macintosh to the last iPad. Steve's mind naturally converged its logical left brain and creative right brain activities and thus enabled him to gracefully connect the complex with the simple. More importantly, he imbued his \\"think different\\" philosophy into every product using the KISS - \\"Keep it Small & Simple\\" - standard that required every user experience to be as intuitive and simple as possible, even when it meant integrating very sophisticated hardware and software to make it happen.  The flip side of Steve's KISS was an insistence on providing a tightly-controlled, end-to-end user experience, which required him to manage a very vertically-integrated company. In the age of the internet and open systems, this was a rather contrarian approach. But, as Isaacson points out with several instances in the book, Steve did display some very contradictory traits-both, on the personal side and in his professional behavior. Nonetheless, these contradictions did not prevent him from achieving what he set out to do. Again, this is a characteristic that cannot be acquired and probably not a management style that ordinary people would be able to pull off. But Steve did!  Steve was not only opposed to a horizontally-fragmented, decentralized company structure, but also adopted a very collaborative management style to boot-it involved all functional departments at all stages of the concept-to-launch cycle. This operating style enabled him to tinker, change and even scrap late-stage designs and start over, if the perfectionist in him was not satisfied with the way a product/service was turning out. Steve defied conventional product marketing methods and, in fact, did not believe in traditional market research. Again, this methodology had a better chance of succeeding in the \\"build it and they will come\\" naivete of the B2C world, but would be more difficult to pull off in the stricter demands of the B2B world. It probably explains why Steve was wildly successful in the B2C industries and to a lesser degree in the B2B sectors.   To read the complete review, check my blog, \\"The Marketing Id.\\"
0811875555|5.0|Beautiful, beautiful book! Got it for one of my best friends (studying graphic design and animation) for Christmas. Exceeded expectations! Bigger than I thought and looks expensive (at the list price, it is, but I got it at Amazon price which is like half off). Very bookshelf worthy. So beautiful I handle the pages carefully so my grubby little hands won't ruin them. Pages are amazing, pics are amazing, text gave really interesting info but not so much that it's boring. And Amazon gets 5 stars all the way from shipping to packaging to pricing. Can't wait to give it to my friend and for her to open it on Christmas! I'm 100% sure she'll be thrilled.

B005I6EU7U|4.0|It's a lovely cover, and has received a number of compliments, but it's true that the cover doesn't sit flat and that because the cover isn't secured the Kindle inside is less protected than it could be.  This would be absolutely the perfect cover if it had either a simple (brass?) book latch type of catch to hold it shut, or a leather magnetic strap catch -- or the best of all possible worlds, a magnetic brass book latch!  And if the maker will put one of those things on (prefer a brass book latch, just sayin') -- I would happily purchase another one.
0307888681|5.0|This book was a surprise. I'm not really into Zombies but this plays it straight. What would you do if there was a worldwide pandemic that was 100% fatal and turned you into a zombie when you died? Human nature runs the full spectrum from profiteers, cowards, selfless deeds and drastic solutions once all other options have run out.   The story is told through a series of interviews and cover WWZ from it's outbreak to the point where humanity has clawed back some countries and can start again. It's biggest redeeming feature is that the people interviewed are from all over the world and differing cultures. This is not simply the Zombie invasion of America though the US does take up a large section of the middle you still get to see how other other countries tackled the problem (or not).   Overall, it's a thought provoking look at how a pandemic could spread (almost impossible to contain depending on spread vector) and the consequences our current lifestyles in trying to recover in the aftermath
B00004Y6O9|5.0|I'm not a huge rock and roll fan- my preferences tend towards jazz, classical, opera, musical theatre etc. To the extent that I venture toward the world of pop/rock I tend to stick with African-American music (R&B, Motown, blues, Stax, Atlantic etc). However, and I know you've heard it all before, since I'm reviewer No.3,489,742, this is truly a superlative album- kick ass rock at its absolute best. No matter what your musical preferences you can't call yourself an open-minded music lover if you can't appreciate what this album offers- killer hooks, dazzling baroque guitar, banshee vocals, driving energy, and original riffs that a thousand imitators still can't replicate. Fabulous record- it sounds like these guys loved every minute making it. I've worn out two cassetes, the first acquired as a teenager when it was released, one vinyl LP, and I'm now onto CD No.2. If you collect music on the basis that you like representative samples of different genres, or if you just happen to have eclectic tastes, your collection is as incomplete without this record as it would be without Pet Sounds, Rubber Soul, Innervisions etc. It's on the 'Classic Album' section of the inflight entertainment package on at least two airlines that I've flown with.

1451627289|5.0|An enthralling book, full of surprises - not least the fact that by the end, one cares less about whether or not JFK's assassination is thwarted, than about the relationships between the fictional characters, and especially between the hero and the woman he's fallen for. Some reviewers are calling King the American Dickens and the case for that description is just getting stronger and stronger. As with Dickens, there are occasional slips (I find it hard to believe that anyone in 1960 said 'You rock!', and I laughed at the reference to a 'gorgeous man's wallet' - is that a gorgeous wallet designed for a man, or a wallet belonging to a gorgeous man? :) -- well, even Homer nods). But the book is a masterpiece by a novelist at the very top of his form...noble, heroic, eloquent.
1400079276|4.0|This was the first book of Haruki Murakami that I read.  It is clear to see why he is the most popular Japanese writer outside of Japan.  John Updike described the book as a \\"real page-turner, as well as a metaphysical mind-bender\\".  I agree.  Although the later part of the book seemed to drag a bit, perhaps because of mundane detail.  On the other hand, the way Murakami bends popular culture, magical realism, suspense humor, and sexuality was brilliant.  I also enjoyed the emphasis on Japanese religious traditions, particularly Shinto.  Next up, I want to read 'Norwegian Wood'.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|This is only good as a screen protector when carrying the Fire around.  It holds the Fire up when you don't need to touch it...quite a waste of money.
B005LRWRZ8|4.0|Sudden Death is a really hard hitting track that sounds a lot like old school Megadeth, and it might very well be the best \\"new\\" track on the album. However, I've had the song (as a single) for nearly a year now and having listened to it so much, it's kind of hard to feel the song as being part of TH1RT3EN because of that.   Public Enemy No. 1 is just as good as Sudden Death, but not as relentless in its attack. I've found myself listening to this one a lot since I picked up the album, it's definitely the kind of song you'll have stuck in your head for a while.  Guns, Drugs, & Money is my second least favorite song on the album, the vocal performance and lyrics on this one can be grating at points.  Never Dead sounds way out of place, it was written for a video game of the same name and it's very obvious that it was meant for something else. It's not a bad song though, actually it's one of the better songs on the album.     New World Order hits much harder than it did on the demo/Duke Nukem version (Warchest and Youthanasia re-issue), not a lot has changed but I'm happy they revisited this song. It's very polished and musically as well as vocally aggressive. As a conspiracy theory junkie this might be one of my favorite Megadeth songs ever.  Black Swan was a United Abominations leftover/demo, but it definitely feels more like a classic Megadeth song.  Idk if I'm the only one, but Wrecker really annoys me. The song is about a homewrecking harlot who went out of her way to destroy everything in the protagonist of the song's life... just everything about this song irks me, and I would've been happier if it was left off the album completely, it's that bad.  Millennium of the Blind is another classic Megadeth song revisited, and wow this one is good. The new lyrics are haunting, and it's really cool to see how the song fleshed out and how far it has come since its demo days. Probably my favorite song on the album, everything about this song is quality from the lyrics andvocals to the instrumentation.   13 is basically Victory from a different point of view, it's more about the struggles Dave (and the band itself) has went through to get this far. While Victory was a celebration of the past and struggle, 13 leaves you feeling kind of melancholy and wondering where Megadeth will go from here. Definitely a great song.  Whose Life (Is It Anyways?), We The People, Fast Lane and Deadly Nightshade aren't bad songs, (I enjoy them all) but they kind of feel like filler compared to other tracks on the album.   TH1RT3EN definitely has an old school Megadeth feel (think Cryptic Writings/Youth era), though I'm not sure if that's because of the reworked versions of New World Order and Millennium of the Blind or the return of David Ellefson.  It's kind of hard to guess where Megadeth will go from here because so much of the album's content came from other sources...    -Sudden Death was originally written for Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock   -Never Dead was written for inclusion on the soundtrack of a game by the same name   -New World Order was originally on the Duke Nukem Soundtrack.   -Black Swan came as a demo with preorders of United Abominations through the MegaFanClub   -Millennium of the Blind was a demo from the Youthanasia sessions.
B003TJR2HS|1.0|Bought this item with great hopes for my I-phone which has an Otterbox case. When I plugged the CableJive in to my JBL on stage II smoke appeared along with a very acrid smell. Before I could disconnect it, it started sparking and part of the case started to melt. It also damaged the charge function on the JBL unit. Thank God I didn't have my I-phone plugged in. Scary as there is no way to test it first. Returned it to Amazon.com for refund. Gave it one star because review would not let me continue with no star.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Awesome app.  Got it back in July when it was free on Amazon App store.  Actually hate my phone without it.  Problem is, after latest update it was not working at all.  Read some people that said uninstall and reinstall.  Seems there is no way to reinstall from Amazon App Store after uninstalling.  It no longer shows up on the App Store app on my phone and there is no option to reinstall on the Amazon website.  Since I got it off Amazon, Android Market wants me to pay for the app.  Bogus.  Can anyone help me?
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have been a fan of Stephen King's for quite some time. I've read everything he's had published. I must say, I really loved this book. It was a great story. What if one could go back into the past to stop JFK's assassination? What a great premise for a book. It's also a wonderful love story. I laughed out loud in many parts of the book, and cried in others. The book certainly gets a 5-star rating from me. :-)
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|FIRST OFF I LOVE THE MOVIE!  10 OUT OF 5 STARS FOR THE MOVIE!  I have never given a 1-star rating before!  I pre-ordered this title a long time ago and I still have the e-mail receipt.  It says nothing about an \\"Ultraviolet\\" Digital Copy... but now it does on the Amazon sight if I click the link from my past orders.  I purchased this set because I've loved having previous Harry Potter digital copies on my laptop, iPhone, iPad, etc.  Had I known the UV digital copy was such a joke I would not have purchased this set!  I would have paid less for the DVD/Bluray alone and purchased the REAL digital copy by some other means.  I am absolutely disgusted by this worthless UV digital copy junk!  Thanks for nothing Warner Brothers!
B000UR9T8W|5.0|What more can I type. It's excellent and cystal clear. Glad I've found the trilogy, and at such a affordable cost.
B002ZG99TA|1.0|So basically this movie is about a runaway train.  2 stereotype movie characters, Wise Grizzled Old-Timer (Denzel) and Raw but Courageous Newbie (Pine) have to stop it.    They add in some moronic dialog and some fake tension involving schoolkids, and a lame non-story about Pine's marital troubles and Denzel's pension to pad the running time.  There is also a woefully miscast Rosario Dawson looking and sounding like she wandered in from another movie that is set in the Bronx.    But in essence there is nothing more to this movie than a train approaching a curve at a high speed.  It could almost be an old-time silent film, it's just missing the girl tied to the tracks.  That's not to say movies like this can't be suspenseful - Speed being a prime example - but this one isn't suspenseful at all.  I won't give away the ending.  But either they stop it... or they don't.  Take a guess before watching, you'll probably be right.

B001TH7GT6|5.0|These cables are thick, heavy, and give the aura of being very well made.  Their coloring is a little off compared to the traditional Red, White, Yellow but they work as intended.

This is a good album but not a great one.  It is only the presence of \\"Song to Woody\\" that pushes this CD from three stars into four stars.
B00275EHJG|3.0|***This review may contain spoilers***<br /><br />Let me establish at the outset that I have savored and appreciated all three \\"Toy Story 3\\" movies for their charm, latent sly satire, cliffhanging adventure, and vivid characters.  At the same time, however, the trilogy continues two dark, harsh themes - abandonment/death and set-in-stone villainy - without really addressing either one squarely.  As the trilogy progressed, first Woody, then Jessie the Yodeling Cowgirl, then eventually ALL of the toys confronted abandonment, obsolesence, and even destruction.  The flaming inferno of the garbage incinerator at \\"Toy Story 3\\"'s (hereafter TS3's) climax was an indelible symbol of toy oblivion.  But because TS3 is of course a Disney/Pixar movie, no toy buys the farm, not even the suavely ruthless Lotso Hugging Bear.  This is understandable; TS3 would have taken a dive profit-wise even if a minor toy character had been destroyed.  However, TS3 kicks the abandonment can down the road toward the movie's end, where young adult Andy bequeaths all his toys, even Woody whom he improbably wanted to take to college with him, to the little girl who was his neighbor.  Many viewers hail this as an intensely emotional scene, but I think the scene is somewhat overrated because we never knew enough about Andy to be emotionally invested in his sacrifice, and anyway the toys didn't really care about who played with them (as long as they were gentle, of course).  Furthermore, the abandonment issue is not resolved because someday the little girl will become a big girl, and the toys will have to face their abandonment/mortality all over again.  Perhaps that is TS3's morbid point.<br /><br />More distressing is the theme that permeates almost any Disney or Pixar animated feature - once a villain always a villain.  As far as I am aware, the only Disney animated villain, major or minor, who ever repented of his wickedness (at least kinda) was Iago the parrot in the Aladdin movies.  But in the Toy Story trilogy, neither Sid, nor Stinky Pete, nor Lotso rise above bitter evil vindictiveness.  In TS3, Lotso seemed to have a shot at redemption.  We learn of his and his giant baby doll henchman's abandonment by the side of a road by his thoughless female owner.  Woody saves Lotso's life from the conveyor belt leading to the incinerator.  But in the final analysis, the evil force is too strong with Lotso. He forsakes all the toys, compatriots and non-compatriots, to their fiery fate as he attempts to escape. Yet poetic justice intervenes; for his misdeeds, Lotso suffers, not fiery death, but perhaps a worse fate, being pinned to a bug-infested garbage truck grill with other unlucky stuffed animals.  I don't think irredeemable evil is a theme you should sell to impressionable young minds.  It would be nice to demonstrate that, yes, sometimes an evil character can atone for his misdeeds.<br /><br />I don't mean to make TS3 sound so sinister.  For the most part, it is light, cheery, upbeat, and howlingly funny (especially Mr. Potato Head's turn as Tortilla Man).  But it does have a dark underbelly, which in and of itself is not bad, and is actually commendable, but it does not directly deal with that underbelly, and that is not so commendable.<br /><br />3.5 stars out of five.ther Sid, nor Stinky Pete, nor Lotso rise above bitter evil vindictiveness.

B0025KVLRO|5.0|The Beatles/ Please Please Me: Their first UK album is great but even greater if you combine it with the singles from the Past Masters Vol. 1 disk.  Great collection of songs for so early in the 1960's and the production team ought to be given more credit for taking the group seriously (at a time when other `teenybopper' groups were getting very little help with the quality of their recordings).  Highly Recommended.
0755314085|4.0|I LOVED this book.  In spite of being a non-engineer who struggles to use computers at a basic level, I found Woz's story of his life fascinating. I generally prefer historical biographies, but a review of this book caught my eye. Genius always amazes me.  Here we have pure genius and pure human intricately interwoven in one person, who is my age and still alive.  Don't look for literary prose.  My guess is that Woz dictated the book - at one point it stops mid-sentence. . And the next paragraph changes subjects completely.      A very real glimpse of Woz & Jobs: Two working class kid geniuses growing up through adolescence and into young adulthood when WHAM! -- after both dropped out of college they play with their electronics obsession and end up revolutionizing business and our lives with a computer they built. Then come Woz's equally real, but much more painful, struggles with love, money, and nearly dying, which leads to his change of careers (more than once) out of a genuine desire to make the world better.  The stories of why he left college and how, when he eventually wanted to go back to school, he had to use an assumed name because he had become so famous, are hilarious and heart wrenching stories of coming of age.  A great book for high school aged boys - or young baby boomers like me.  I honestly couldn't put it down and read it 3 days.
0307716511|3.0|This was such an odd book for me to read.  I first tried a couple of months ago when I first got it through the Vine program.  I had the hardest time getting into it and ultimately put it down.  I picked it up on a whim this week and was totally riveted!  I did find the writing style a little disjointed- it alternates between her \\"talking\\" to her dead sister Tess and recounting the events for a lawyer.  At times I had a hard time switching back and forth and even getting the timeline of events correct.  There was such a build up about the twist, both from the book description and a friend that I was a little disappointed.  I felt like the twist really changed the feel of the book.  I will admit that I was kind of racing through the lats chapters so I want to go back and reread.  I think this book is definitely a page turner and I would recommend that other readers give it chance.
B005BGBPBG|1.0|I read the books and loved them...watching this movie was like ripping out pages to the books one by one. So, so, so bad! not even the same story line. don't waste yoru time and I like movies that suck sometimes - even romantic comedies, but this was bad!
B0025UHKNS|2.0|I've had this GPS watch since it was a Gold Box offer in early June.  When it works, it does what it promises.  Unfortunately, far too frequently it doesn't do what I expect and I wind up frustrated yet again that I spent so much money on it.  The primary problem. as other reviews have noted, is that the watch's user interface is simply dreadful.  The combinations of presses, swipes and taps used to control it are not at all intuitive and even after I took time with the manual and finally figured out how to keep the watch doing what I expect, it's extremely finicky. I practically have to take a hammer to it to get it to accept certain inputs while the slightest breeze can send it into spasms of functions and corners of the user menu I didn't know existed.  For example, just this afternoon I set the timer and pressed both buttons together to lock the bezel to keep it from taking random inputs.  I must have done something wrong, because a few minutes into the run it announced it was going into power saver mode (it was just off the charger and reported a 100% charge).  I stopped it and tried to lock it again and again, but every time I looked down it was off on to something other screen.  It spent the rest of the run trying to go into power saver mode ever 5 minutes and managed to lose both my time and distance.  I wore a very light long sleeve shirt on the run to keep out the cool and I can only assume the light brush of my sleeve was setting the watch off.   Of course, today was they first time I decided I could trust the watch (use after using it 2-3 times a week for the last 4 months) so I didn't have my back up timer with me. The first time this has happened, but hardly the first time the watch as left me in the lurch.  Combine all that with how clumsy the charging clip can be and the general issues with putting a GPS in this small a package (sometimes spotty satellite reception and terrible battery life), I can't recommend this to anyone who isn't so determined to have it they're willing to put up with a lot of frustration.
B004AUGJS8|4.0|I liked this movie and can't believe it's a true story. I think what made it even better is that I watched it knowing nothing about what it was about...I thought it was going to be a fluffy romantic comedy...i was wrong and pleasantly surprised. Great acting too!
B003FXXNBW|3.0|I rented this movie before buying it, so I knew what I was getting into:  good fight scenes saddled with a clunky plot about Boyka redeeming himself.<br /><br />What bothered me, though, was the disc itself.  No, there were no technical issues, it's just the only thing on it was the movie, NO SPECIAL FEATURES AT ALL.  Come on, would it kill you to throw in a couple of trailers and maybe a behind-the-scenes \\"making of\\" featurette?  Even its predecessor had that, buyer beware.
B001UV4XI8|4.0|A little disappointed and a new lesson learned:  When buying a Blu-ray that includes a digital download - well, don't expect the digital download if the Blu-ray was released more than about 6 months ago.  Seems that there are expiration dates on the download.  So-you don't get what's advertised all the time.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Breaking Dawn Part 1 is so far the best by far. Their acting was amazing and they made everyone look HOT!  It had a little bit of everything, drama, suspense, comedy, and I even jumped at a few parts! If I had 5 thumbs they would all be up!

B005I6EU7U|4.0|The first thing to realize is that, in spite of the description, this cover is not made specifically for the Kindle Fire. The packaging I received says \\"Works with: Kindle 3, nook 1st edition, nook color, Kobo, Kobo Touch, Sony Reader, Samsung Galaxy Tab, and more.\\" I believe the Fire is the thickest of this lot, so that may explain why it is not a perfect fit. The Fire is hard to get in, and the cover doesn't close perfectly flat.<br /><br />UPDATE: After a while, it did fit perfectly flat. I would set the Fire, while it was in the case, upside down when not in use. After about 6 weeks, it did flatten and fit perfectly). Also I have received many compliments on this case.<br /><br />HELPFUL HINT: It is much easier to get the Fire in horizontally, that is, long way first, than vertically.<br /><br />The pros of this case are<br />1) It is beautiful. The non-leather outer skin really does look like leather, and the whole case looks like a very old, expensive book.<br />2) The elastic is strong and holds the Fire securely.<br />3) When the case is closed, there is a small overhang that will protect the edges.<br />4) The lining is very soft and protective.<br />5) There is an inner flat pocket (I'm keeping a lens cleaning microfiber cloth in there).<br />6) Open, it folds all the way back and forms an inch lip that makes it easy to hold the Fire with.<br />7) It does not add a noticeable amount of weight.<br /><br />The cons are<br />1) The whole first paragraph of this review. It is not a perfect fit for the Fire.<br />2) It smells bad when you first get it. Be prepared to air it out for a while. If you are very sensitive to chemical smells, do not get this.<br />3) It doesn't have a built stand, nor is it practical to manipulate this case to form a stable stand.<br />4) There is nothing that holds the case closed.<br />5) The elastic does cross the speakers. I don't know how much this impedes the sound (if at all), because I use earphones.<br /><br />I gave this case four stars because it largely meets my expectations. I wanted a pretty rather than practical case, although I was disappointed that the fit isn't better, and that caused me to dock a star from the review.<br /><br />The lack of a built-in stand doesn't bother me because I already owned this stand: [[ASIN:B000CKVOOY Arkon Portable Fold-Up Stand]] which IMO is probably the most practical stand available, since it is very adjustable and works with just about anything. It works for the Fire whether it is in or out of this case, both horizontally and vertically.
B004LAIU4I|3.0|If you see some of my other reviews, you will see I hold three songwriters above all others at the top of the pop/rock mountain, Curtis Mayfield, Smokey Robinson and Paul Simon.<br /><br />Needless to say I have everything this brilliant man has created and bought this album the day it came out.<br /><br />I don't mean to put other folks down, but I simply can not fathom how any lover of music could buy an album like this and attempt to review it in the first day/week/month.  I see folks review this, (and other) albums in the first week of their existence and refer to them as \\"growers\\".  How can one ascertain that something is a grower after one week?  How can anyone review any album worth its' salt in the first day/week?  Music (good music anyway) takes time to absorb.  Any way, back off my high horse and to the matter at hand...<br /><br />Having sat with this album off and on now for the past seven months, I have found some songs to be real gems, and others to be very lacking.  There is another 3 star review from Kelvin Brown stating \\"It works if melody isn't your thing\\", and I mostly agree with this assessment.  I share his opinion that there is nothing on this album that makes you turn off your car and continue to hum the song while walking into the house/work etc.. (saving perhaps the first song).<br /><br />With that being said there are still a few songs on here that are beyond brilliant.<br /><br />Love and Hard Times, Love and Blessings, and most especially Questions for the Angels are very strong songs.<br /><br />Getting Ready for Christmas Day and Rewrite are also extremely enjoyable.<br /><br />The problem comes with the other half of the album.  This is where the \\"non-melody\\" aspect really kicks in for me.  Mind you, it's not that the songs are \\"bad\\" per se.  It's just that they don't really go anywhere.  Strong ideas that could be taken to a higher place if only a strong chorus existed just wind up meandering on.  Grooving along.  These wind up feeling like Paul Simon doing his best James Brown imitation.  (And I love James Brown for the record). Basically, he's found a groove and he doesn't want to stray from it.  Only  - these aren't James Brown grooves....<br /><br />Bottom line, I like the album and think any die hard Paul Simon fan will discover some songs that really resonate with them.  But for the casual/uncertain fan, I hope you don't try to discover the majesty of Paul Simon by starting with this album.

B005I6EU7U|5.0|I received this case before I received my Kindle Fire, and the initial reviewers were very negative regarding the size and fit of this product.  I admit to having doubts about its applicability to the Fire after not seeing the Kindle Fire's name on the included cardboard insert and seeing the position of the elastic straps on the inside of the case.    However, once I received the Fire everything became a lot more clear.  The straps very snugly hold the device in place and there is no give.  It takes a little extra effort to initially secure your device, but it shows no inkling of any potential to fall out.  I've tried holding it in one hand and shaking the case vigorously and was not able to detect any movement in the Fire.  The front cover does close flat.  I had to massage the \\"spine\\" of the cover a little to \\"loosen\\" up the material for it to get a little more stretch across the front.  I expect that it will will slowly become even better with time.  I love the look and feel of the cover, and that's why I originally pre-ordered it.  The seeming of a real book instead of a tablet is an interesting direction for the case design, and makes the flat rectangular slab much more attractive.  On the negative side, the gold accenting on the outside showed some slight indications of imperfections, but, realistically, I never expected them to remain in perfect condition for the life of the tablet, so I'm willing to overlook this small defect in workmanship, since the rest of the execution on the design is perfect.  If you need a cover/case that allows you to insert or remove your Fire on a regular basis, this item is probably not for you as it is geared more towards someone who will be keeping it in the case for the life of the product. Since you can't replace the battery, there's not really any reason to remove it anyways.

030788743X|5.0|Yes, the characters are pedestrian  Yes, the dystopian world has been done before  Yes, the plot is both trite and quite predictable  Yes, the writing is solid but nothing special  None of that matters a bit.  This is a love story written not about a person but about a time and place.  It's about walking into the dark arcade with your fist wrapped around a roll of quarters, or sitting in your friend's basement playing D&D and drinking cheap soda all night or experiencing a new Star Wars movie on the big screen.  For those of us who lived that, it's a truly stunning work.  Sit back, channel your inner geek and ride along- I've never had anything drag back my past in quite the same way.  I had to laugh reading the one star review where the reviewer complained about the multi-page description of playing a perfect Pac-Mac game.  That's not a diversion- that's the *entire* *point* of the book.  The plot and characters are wholly secondary to the beautifully evoked reality of 1980s nerddom.

0393057658|5.0|This book was in good condition and is almost like new.  The book itself is a pretty easy read and is very detailed about how baseball changed its ways in scouting and drafting of players.  Very interesting.

1451648537|2.0|As another reviewer mentioned, anyone interested in this book needs to listen to John Siracusa's critique on the Hypercritical podcast, episode 42. His list of criticisms is vast and rightfully damning.  The long and short of it is that Issacson ruined a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to write a biography with direct access to Steve Jobs. There is no evidence that he made any effort to understand the industry Apple is in, nor the technology it created with Jobs at the helm. The book is riddled with technical errors: getting the name of the company wrong (\\"Apple Computers\\"), continuously referring to Mac OS X as \\"OSX\\", misattributed photos (one with Jobs and Woz and an Apple II+ is labeled as \\"in the garage\\" in \\"1974\\", despite the fact that the II+ came out in 1979 and they are obviously sitting in Apple's Cupertino offices), and some quotes attributed to folks like Bill Gates that just sound nonsensical.  Even more damning is that the strongest parts of the book, such as the creation of the original Macintosh, are obviously relying heavily on existing documentation such as Andy Hertzfeld's fantastic [[ASIN:1449316247 Revolution in The Valley [Paperback]: The Insanely Great Story of How the Mac Was Made (Otx)]]. Once we get to the era of Job's return to Apple in 1996, the book becomes very superficial. Issacson suddenly switches from a chronological narrative to a product-based one, and we learn virtually nothing new about the creation of some of the most revolutionary products in history (e.g., the iPhone). I found this pretty unforgivable, as this is not only some of the most important technology in history, but also arguably Jobs' greatest triumphs. Really, the books turns into a superficial history of Apple, and not a biography of Jobs. We learn nothing new, which is a grievous sin given Issacson's access to Jobs.  I will admit that the writing is competent, if not inspiring; I tore through the book pretty quickly. But, in the end, I agree with Siracusa that Jobssimply picked the wrong guy for the job. Any reader of this book would do well to listen to Siracusa's critique, and then go hunt down some of the far better books that have been written about Apple.   Steve Jobs cared about the details. This book doesn't. Steve Jobs said Apple lived at the intersection of technology and the humanities. This book should have positioned itself there as well, with powerful writing that demonstrated a mastery of the technical subjects on which it must focus. It does neither. I can only hope that, someday, Siracusa, or perhaps John Gruber, will take up the task of writing a far more insightful, inspiring book about Jobs' life. Steve is one of the giants of our age, and he deserves better.
B004LUS390|5.0|Coming from the makers of Autocad and 3D Studio MAX, you simply cant go wrong.  Many features and fun for artists and non-artists.

B0055SWM08|5.0|About halfway through and fairly easy so far but a pleasant journey, no doubt. Reminds me a little of sokoban.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an excellent app.  I have in on my Blackberry as well as on my Kindle Fire.  I like that you are able to download different bibles onto the device as well as use others available on the net.  If you want to read and compare different interpretations of the bible this is the app to get!
B00005JLIU|5.0|This movie is well directed.  The actors enjoy their roles and perform well with each other.  The 'violence' is comical but not slapstickish.  The teenager who watched it with me enjoyed the movie.  A good choice for a family evening of entertainment.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I am not really sure what people thought this was supposed to do... but for me it works just fine. I really like it. It's not bulky and it's truly light. The Kindle Fire is a bit heavier than I anticipated so the light weight case works very well with it. Fits nicely in my purse and I don't have to worry about it getting all scratched,  by key's cell phone etc.  At the end of the day it's all in what you like if you want a hard shell with a stand (stand worked just fine for me) a light case. Go with this. If you prefer a leather, softer case go with one of the others, but I am really pleased with my decision to get this one. I got it in pink and it's very pretty.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|I bought the cover with two purposes in mind.<br /><br />1. Protect the device<br />2. Convert into a stand<br /><br />I'd give four stars to the first, and two stars to the second.<br /><br />Feels flimsy as everyone else has said. It should be adequate for protection though.<br /><br />As far as being a stand though, I was expecting something in line with the iPad2 cases I've seen. My bad. This one has the cover fold in half and the edge aligns with an itty bitty groove on the back and makes a triangle. The resulting stand is barely stable, especially if you're watching it on a not-perfectly-flat surface like a bed and have cats wandering around.<br /><br />Summary - it's ok, but I may return if I find something that works better.

B004OZOTSQ|5.0|For some reason when I mount my phone over USB the write speed to its internal SD is 120KB/s but by some miracle this app gets well over 1MB/s. It's sorcery but I love it anyway!
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|The movie is good but I'm not rating it for that. I rating it 1 star because of the fact that Ultraviolet is a STREAMING service. That means that you can't download your movie through iTunes and take it with you on a plane. I wrote to them and complained they sent me a letter with an iTunes download code but had the audacity to condescendingly blame me for the whole thing as if I'm some sort of technological nit-wit. Here is their letter.  [Dear Kenny:  Thank you for being one of our best customers and among the first to try UltraViolet(tm) (UV) Digital Copy.  While we have received a lot of positive reaction to UltraViolet, we realize that with any new technology there is a learning curve for both creators and consumers, and this is especially true around new user experiences.  It's important to us that you are fully satisfied with your purchase. We are issuing you an an iTunes code for your movie so that you can obtain an iOS-compatible download of this title immediately.  ******************  To redeem your code, please follow these instructions:  1. Open iTunes.  2. Navigate to the iTunes Store.  3. Locate the \\"Redeem\\" link in the right side of the Storefront in the Quick Links panel.  4. Enter your Authorization Code.  5. If the files do not show up in your Download queue, click \\"Store\\" > \\"Check for Available Downloads\\"]  What positive reactions? Everyone hates this service. I don't like there terms of service and I don't like that the movie studios control it and can revoke the title at any time without warning. Ultraviolet is out of sync with the rest of technology.
B005974CNA|5.0|Actually ADTOE was my first full album to hear from Dream Theater, I bought the deluxe edition including the DVD for how the band chosen their new drummer which really showed the guys are fully matured world class musicians, I got in love with dream theater afterwards. I then bought thier albums (systematic chaos, Black clouds&silver linings then Scenes from a memory, Six degrees of inner turbulance and Octavarium)and I will sure look for the remaining CDs .   if you are new to Dream Theater like me, I recommend Six Degrees of inner turbulance after this one.. ADTOE is a wonderful album for sure and whether you like the drummer Mike Mangini or not, It is Dream Theater.. I love Mike ..
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|it says digital copy, but you do NOT get an itunes code. you get an ultraviolet/flixster code. do you really want to deal with an entirely new and separate movie app, player, drm system etc??? i didn't think so. nuff said.
0375842209|5.0|A small, simple, breathtaking book. Very powerful and vivid book that despite all of the heartbreak left me with a smile at the end. The memory of love, the notion that the protagonist experienced, brought her happily through life in the end.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Could not believe this was received so fast.  Ordered on weekend, received on Tuesday, thanks for great service.  Looks brand new!
B00664BWI8|5.0|Fantastic show. I love all the actors and actresses, they are very good at what they do. And Damon is my all time favorite. He tries to be bad but he knows he would never let anything happen to Elena. Unfortunately I only get to watch this show when my boyfriend isn't home so it's nice to have the instant video anytime that I want.
B0040UAYI4|4.0|If you are like many today who are migrating to the console for online games because of the lure of bigger and better graphics on HD sets, but still are used to the mouse and keyboard from previous years of PC gaming, this Eagle Eye converter is as good as it gets to getting a PC experience on console.  My tips for success:   1)Make sure you have a compatible keyboard and mouse, Logitech seems to work.  2)Turn off all turbo settings on converter.  3)Follow all instructions and you are good as gold.  While graphics have come a long way on the console, the controls are still unfortunately very generic and lack precision, unless you are good with a game controller, in which case you would not be reading this. The Eagle Eye is not perfect and you will not get the precision of a PC mouse on the console, but it is up there and well worth the money. Were it not for this product, I would likely not even play console games online.
B001HN6922|1.0|A very disappointing sequel and nothing like the original! This was dark, violent, and had inappropriate themes. Only watched 40 minutes of it and then gave up as it was too depressing. Is this what we are showing children as entertainment? Not good.
B005H5H3LW|4.0|For me this was like finding my lost Han Solo action figure 30 years later, and it being better than I remember.  The FX and sets are crisp and sharp.  The Yamato herself is very faithful to the original.  As I was viewing the movie for the first time I did become aware of differences in pacing from American action films.  It's more of a curiosity than a complaint.  Also, this movie does try to compress a one year journey thru space into two hours.  This material could easily use two more.  I was delighted with all the nods to the original cartoon series.  There were just so many great moments in the series, I'm sure the editors had a hard time trimming it down.  I am happy to own this film and I hope they do try and make a US version with a more international crew.  This film reminds me of what I like about Star Trek the original series.  It allows some fantasy in its story, like WW II battleships flying thru space.  But don't change the Yamato, it's perfect.
B00632HWOG|2.0|Not sure if this is a bug or a feature, but on the Kindle Fire, the Yahoo email app shows only ten messages. Also, it automatically assumes you want to display all images in an email. I have not found a way to turn off that \\"feature.\\" For now, therefore, I am sticking with the email app that comes pre-loaded on the Fire.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Warner Bros needs to ditch Ultra Violet and go back to offering iTunes for digital copy.  The movie itself is great.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|The movie was absolutely fantastic and watching it in BluRay was an amazing experience!  My only complaint was that the digital copy is ONLY available in the UltraViolet format.  My family absolutely loves the AppleTV (we have one connected to each of the televisions in our home). As there is no way to view an UltraViolet digital copy on my AppleTV, the only way to watch the digital copy on a television would be to load the Flixster application onto an iOS device, watch the movie and use AirPlay to stream the video to the AppleTV.    Fortunately, I was able to submit a support request to the following address, include my UltraViolet access code, and request a redeemable iTunes code.    [...]    Within a couple of hours, I received the iTunes code, downloaded the movie into iTunes and was happily watching it on my television from my AppleTV!  While I disdain the UltraViolet format, I am pleased that their customer support team helped me out.  It lets me watch the movie I purchased on my terms!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is the first book that I've bought in a long while that I haven't been able to put down. I read it at work when I have free time and I'm nose deep in it when I'm at home. This book was amazing.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|I purchased this item sight unseen and, unfortunately, before any significant number of reveiws were available.  I am totally disappointed, it is a piece of junk.  I bought it along with a pre-order of the Kindle Fire as a gift to my wife and have not yet received the Fire, so can't verify that it fits or not.  I own a Kindle 3 (what is now apparently known as a Kindle Keyboard.)  I purchased a much better holder/cover/folder for this device at Staples for $20.  More substantial, cushioned, holds the Kindle tightly.  When I get the Fire, I will probably use the Staples cover for it and see if the other unit will fit in this piece of junk.  If not, next time I visit Staples --
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Seriously, you'll have NO CLUE as to what's going to happen in this book.  So many twists and turns!    I will say that the book does start out VERY slow, but it is an amazing conclusion to the series.
B005P89F1C|5.0|Every song on this album is fantastic. The DVD footage of the recording studio session is awesome. I especially like the part where Justin is bopping his head to the beat of the music. There is a really great full length video for \\"Pray\\" that tugs at the heart. You won't be disappointed with this holiday album.
B004EPZ07K|1.0|THE GREEN LANTERN<br />Is Rhonda Byrne the script writer for this movie? This question came to my mind pretty often as I sat through this movie, waiting with a yawn (a few dozens of those in fact) for it to end.<br />What can any idea, no matter how good, look like, if it is beaten to death? DEAD, of course, what else.<br />This movie keeps it no secret that the basic tenet it is trying to preach is what many of us have read and seen in Rhonda Byrne's \\"Secret\\".<br />There should NOT have been any problem with the idea had the goings on been more interesting.<br />Two factors screw the secret:<br />One, the special effects do not justify the setting. The dispute is of inter-galactic nature, which should have been shown as a battle of epic proportion BUT the producers were too scared to invest big money to create such a strife on screen. I bet they too were devoured by the Guardian of Fear, Parallax. (Parallax by the way is a black amoebic being, which feeds on fear of civilisations spread across 1000s of \\"sectors\\" in our universe and harbours the diabolical desire to annhilate the Universal Peacekeeping corps known as the GREEN LANTERNS). Nothing wrong with thinking of a BIG CANVAS idea provided one has a BIG CANVAS available. The director and the makers of this movie were seriously hard pressed for funds.<br />Two, I too would have been devoured by the Guardian of Fear, Parallax had I been betting a BIG CANVAS project on a facetious looking leading man. Ryan Reynolds looks like a super hero who was flipping burgers at Mc Donald's before he was \\"chosen\\" by the \\"RING\\" to be part of the corps. The ring, I bet was either affected by the ever growing pollution, when it entered our atmosphere or it was made in China that it chose Ryan Reynolds to assume the role of a peace-keeper, somoene who presumably needed to have the star presence to look convincing fighting off and vanquishing an inter-galactic enemy. A \\"ring\\" in its right mind would have chosen an actor who does not look and act like \\"garibon ka John Travolta\\".<br />Word of advice for the producers - Change the leading man, go to a big investor (call Anil Ambani) and you may have a better sequel to offer.<br />Final Verdict - Watch only if your sleeping pills are losing effect.<br />Rating - yawn/5<br />(P.S: Ryan resembles Hrithik Roshan in some scenes. Poor Hrithik, tcch tcch tcch tcch................)ribon ka John Travolta\\".   Word of advice for the producers - Change the leading man, go to a big investor (call Anil Ambani) and you may have a better sequel to offer.   Final Verdict - Watch only if your sleeping pills are losing effect.  Rating - yawn/5  (P.S: Ryan resembles Hrithik Roshan in some scenes. Poor Hrithik, tcch tcch tcch tcch................)
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I listened to this book and very much enjoyed it.  The narrator was great and the story made the characters come alive.  I listened to it weeks ago and still continue to think about it occasionally.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Great action movie at a greatprice at amazon.com Have purchased other titles also great deal. thanks for the great offers and avaiblity.
B005FJ7DOM|4.0|I remember seeing this movie in a video store about a month or so back. My friends and I where making fun of the of the movie and it's cover art. I remember thinking \\"Oh, god another really awful vampire movie.\\" Then, yesterday I was really tired from having a long day at work and wanted to watch a movie to just go brain-dead and relax to. Well, I was quite surprised at how well the movie was done, and how well the characters where fleshed out, that it not only kept me interested it also made me feel involved. Sure some of the make-up effects are a little low end, but most of the action happens quick enough that you don't really notice. The music score for me really set the atmosphere and matched well with the scenes' mood. The writers did a good job making you feel sympathy for the characters and for the most part everything felt \\"Real\\".   The movie would get a 5-star rating, but there are a few flaws that keep it from being great. I won't spoil anything, but there is a twist that sort of kills the \\"realism\\" towards the end, but it picks back up really quick and doesn't kill the overall movie experience. The pacing of the movie is generally good throughout, but at times it does drag or a scene will feel rushed, other than that it is pretty on point. It has a few cliches and at times you feel as though they are fighting some crazy zombie variant rather than vampires, but once again that doesn't really cripple the overall feel of the movie.  I have watched this movie twice and each time I enjoyed it. I would recommend this movie for people who want something fresh in the whole Vampire/Zombie genre.
B00002SSKI|5.0|One of the best movies for \\"Girl's Night In\\"! It's a beautiful story about friendship and growing up. I've been in love with this movie from the very first time I watched it! Grab the women and/or girls in your life and settle in for fun filled night!
B005OGYHB8|1.0|I purchased and then returned Slash's new live CD.  I counted six f-bombs after listening to less than 1/2 of the CD selections.  No thanks.  What does a group have to do to earn an explicit rating anymore?  It's too bad you can't produce a live cd anymore without trying to appeal to a middle school language mentality.  Grow up!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game.  It was cute and entertaining. I never had any problems on my Thunderbolt with it forcing closed or freezeing.  I hope they add more levels soon, I would love to continue to play through higher and higher levels. That was the only down side, I got through all the levels pretty quickly.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Fun game, simple &amp; beautiful interface. Even when I get stuck, it's never that hard. You just gotta think a little bit. Thoughtfully designed with a phone screen in mind &amp; made for the finger to play.
0394721772|5.0|I received Volume One 26 years ago when I married. We lived in France for 6 years and it was my \\"go to\\" cook book. I just recently bought Volume Two and just regret that I waited so long. If you're serious about  French cooking, you should have these books.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This case is perfectly designed to do what is promised. By itself it seems light but when you put in the fire, it fits snug, and provides a functional cover that doesn't add to the weight (to an already hefty kindle). It stands nicely with the weight of the fire which adds the stability. While still new it seems like the fold/groove for the stand gets a better \\"memory\\" with each use and seems plenty stable on flat surfaces. It seems pretty \\"genius\\" to be able to design a case that has such a transformation when paired with it's intended mate. This is a product where both work better when used together.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I bought this last year and loved it!  The music is truly timeless (we're already enjoying it again this year), inspirational and beautiful.  I highly recommend it.
1451648537|5.0|I was immersed in the Windows PC world from early on and hardly knew what or who Apple was until I was in high school. Receiving my first ipod gave me the chance to learn more about Apple. The book truly goes beyond the corporate history and touches on the many complexities that Steve Jobs was and will be remembered for.   His ambition, perfection, almost bi-polar personality, hippie-like cutlure, and ingenuity are what made Apple such a great company it is today. The books moves pretty quick and doesn't bog you down. It gives great insight to this amazing person's life.  I admit I am only half way through the book, but it's sub 600 pages worth probably won't do justice to cover his persona and life.   It's one of those books that makes you realize how important and amazing life can be.  It's one of my top 5 books of all time.
B001N26GFC|5.0|I needed this movie for class but I was procrastinating and didn't realize I needed it until the day the first draft of my paper (for this film) was due! I rented this movie on Amazon on demand and watched it, wrote it, handed it in. While I was watching the movie for the first time, I realized I couldn't understand a lot of the things some of the characters were saying (really thick british accent). So I ended up buying this DVD half way through so that I can turn on the subtitles to watch it (because I really had to pay attention to every detail for my paper). So the on demand helped me through my first draft, and a couple of days later, this arrived, and I was able to watch it again and write my final draft. Fast shipping, simple yet effective packaging. (I've had some places that sent me one dvd in a huge box with bubble wraps and such... so bad for the environment!)<br /><br />Oh, and the movie's pretty great too!
B005J29HCQ|5.0|Let me begin by saying I am a little surprised that SMiLE was so far from completion,when BW shelved his follow up album to Pet Sounds.For 40-some years I always felt the SMiLE tapes contained a finished SMiLE that just needed to be unpuzzled,using logic and an idea of BW's original sequence of songs.I was wrong,SMiLE was unfinished.BW's 2004 version gave us an idea of the complexity of the vocals missing in some of the songs.These unfinished songs come across as intrumental rather than layered with the Beach Boys lush vocals.Nonetheless,the 2 cd set is at least fascinating and at best a strange masterpiece,that would have stood like a monolith on the 1966-67 musical landscape,and would have become ground zero for the rebirth of American music.SMiLE would have served as it's own innovative example,making us realize,that,at times,SMiLE contains music that's as good as music can be,pushing the limits of artistic expression and makes BW comparable to Mozart,Bach etc...
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This was the first app I downloaded onto my Kindle Fire.  I was so hooked on the game that I didn't notice any ads.  PRO: FREE & FUN  CON: I played so much my neck hurts that I need to see a chiropractor.
B000EQ5HSK|3.0|It is ok. It works as what it is designed for. But beware, since the hood is so huge, it will block the light flash from your built-in flash of your camera, unless you have an external flash mounted then it is perfect.  Would not recommend if you do not have external flash mount.
B004LUS390|5.0|This is the best app I have used on a mobile device by far. As an artists the features inthis app are amazing, they match some of the desktop programs I have used in the past, I would recommend it to any artist with a smart phone.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This has become by far, not only one of my favorite cd's, but also one of my favorite artist. Her music and her vocals make her a unique and soulful artist. This cd does not dissapoint.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Reading a Stephen King book is an experience.  Now some critics might point out what happens in one of his books can never happen in real life.  And, to me, that's the point - he creates worlds and characters that will never, ever exist, but while you are reading they do exist.  His greatest gift is making the unbelievable, well.... believable.  I read a lot and, unfortunately, find a great many books that once started can easily be put down and ignored for a few days.  Not a King book.  I bought this book the day it came out and tried not to start reading it for 3 whole days because I had a big rescue animal fundraiser to get organized.  No luck - I started and read all night.  One other thing - while I love that he writes long, long, long stories I nearly dislocated a shoulder reading \\"Under the Dome\\" - so I was really glad I got a Kindle last Christmas, much easier to hold!
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I got this with the Ultraviolet copy, hoping to be able to watch on my Mac and iPad, but cannot even register. I get confusing \\"forbidden\\" dialogs when trying to register, sometimes they say \\"invalid password\\" (with any kinds of passwords: short, long, U/L, numbers, symbols, etc).   Then I go online and see that nobody's really happy with \\"Ultraviolet\\".  That outta teach me to look up reviews of new technology before I buy it. The BluRay works fine. But I have no idea how Ultraviolet will work, since I can't even register for an account!!!!  Steve
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|Half-human and half-wyr, Pia Giovanni spent her life keeping a low profile among the wyrkind and avoiding the continuing conflict between them and their dark Fae enemies. But after being blackmailed into stealing a coin from the hoard of a dragon, Pia finds herself targeted by one of the most powerful-and passionate-of the Elder races.<br /><br />I loved this story, Dragos and Pia, their romance and the paranormal world surrounding them (which has a little different spin than most others in this genre).  There's tension, conflict, steamy romance and so many funny moments in this book to keep you up late at night trying to finish.  The secondary characters are well developed and integral to the story, which is important to me as it adds dimension. The pace of the story is just about perfect and is not predictable.  I have to re-emphasize, though, that Pia and Dragos have very sizzling encounters.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to continuing this series and recommend this to anyone who loves a good urban fantasy combined with a hot paranormal romance.
1451627289|5.0|Those of you who suffered through Cell and plodded through Under the Dome can pick up King's latest novel with complete assurance that he has returned to his old form. King has created a fresh take on an old theme (is it wise - or even possible - to change the past?) and populated it with characters you quickly come to care about, and - more importantly - believe.  It would be hard to select the five best books by King, but this one will deserve serious consideration for that list.
B0050DZN4K|1.0|can't access google reader.  app just hangs.  this needs to be fixed soon.  if fixed, this would be a 4 star app.  love it on my phone.
B0000020C4|5.0|I have been a fan of Les Miserables since watching a clip of it on YouTube. After completely watching the show (a local theatre group was doing it here). I feel in love with Les Mis. The cast is wonderful. Philip Quast, Michael Ball, and Colm Wilkinson are by far my fav. Broadway stars, ever. Philip's voice is just perfect for Javert and honestly I prefer him over the original Javert. I have always been a Michael Ball fan and so he was the reason for originally listening to this. So that was a plus and even while watching this I had couldn't help but fall in love with Michael Maguire's voice as well. And you may not realize it but Judy Kuhn (Cosette) is also the singing voice in Disney's Pocahontas and Lea Salonga (Eponine) is the singing voice in Disney's Mulan and also of Jasmine in Aladdin. So that's also a plus. All in all a great cd and one of my favorite Broadway soundtracks ever.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|I was never the type of citizen who gave much thought to any \\"scenarios\\" about how background corporate politics shape our goverments' policy; I thought that these were just conspiracy theories or leftist interpretations of the random fluctuations of our economies...   This documentary was an eye opener! It has NOTHING to do with any of the M.Moore movies... this is a truly well-substantiated DOCUMENTARY with interviews of many prominent well-educated people. I really can't describe in words how good this documentary is. Watch it and I am sure that you will update your views on who the \\"invisible hand\\",that Adam Smith described, is in our era...  Although its subject matter is quite complicated, the creators have made a wonderful job of explaining it and making it very watchable and engaging!

B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I bought this 45th anniversary limited edition because I read a review in Sound & Vision magazine. As the author said in the magazine this is an excellent edition. It has lots of information, including a detailed booklet,and as a bonus a music box. The blue ray picture is excellent. The movie is... well I cannot say anything that has not been said before. I am very happy with my purchase and recommend it to others.
0553381695|5.0|This book is amazing! I could not put this book down once I purchased it. The story definitely draws you in and makes you feel as though you are in the Seven Kingdoms. Each character is so intricate and you really don't know what to expect from many of them that you're always on your toes. If you like sci-fi books, like the Lord of the Rings, then you will definitely like this book.
0307352145|4.0|While Quiet is a very comprehensive review of the research and most of the \\"introvert stories\\" are interesting (though a few are a bit long winded...) I'm not sure that it works as a means to promote introvert understanding. It seemed at times that Cain was elevating introversion at the expense of extroverts.  If this is meant to enlighten extroverts I'm not sure that is the right approach.    There's no doubt introverts and extroverts bring different things to the table.  And it was sad to see that introverts have a hard time succeeding, especially in extroverted countries like the US.  But then Cain pointed out the many American introverts who have succeeded none the less.    It wasn't toward the end of the book that Cain laid out suggestions for parents and workplaces to bring out the best in introverts instead of the typical shunning/ignoring many introverts experience.    As for introverts, as always, it's good to know we're not alone.  But knowing you're an introvert in part due to biology only goes so far towards self- acceptance.  Cain's book, by virtue of pointing out the introvert's unique gifts, however, will hopefully lead more introverts to proudly contribute more.  I gave it 4 stars because it was for the most part easy to read and certainly thought-provoking but feel it isn't sure of its focus.

B000SJJCX4|5.0|Bought this in early March this year & have it in-line with my other effects pedals on my pedal board. No problems with it at all. It works as advertised. I've found it to be better quality than the on board tuner that comes in my Fender G-Dec amp so what does that tell you?<br /><br />Not sure what the other low ratings for this pedal are all about because I love mine. For the money you can't get one that touches it. So what if it's not $100+? That means you have more green stuff to buy other things.<br /><br />Since buying this one & having it work so well, I now own a couple of other Behringer pedals.

Watching is as important as listening during a conversation was the lesson I took away. It won't make you a profiler, but you will certainly learn to read people with more accuracy.

As all of Prima's guides it walks you through every aspect of the game and has some great tips and tricks to assist you with character creation and leveling. It also details every part of every main and side quest as well as lists the locations of every skill book, word wall, city, building, farm, shrine and unique plant ingredient in the whole world. The hard back edition of this book looks to be well built and will definitely last many years with moderate care. Great Buy.
1416550550|5.0|I love this book. Let me repeat that: I love this book. I really enjoyed Kate Morton's other books very much and saved this one until last as it has so many wonderful reviews. I was not disappointed. In fact, I was thrilled with it. You know how it is. There are some authors who write in a language that just feels so natural and the rhythm is so easy and comfortable. For me, Kate Morton is one such author.  The novel opens pretty dramatically and it had me hooked almost immediately. It kept my interest to the extent that while I was doing other things I just kept thinking about it and every time I had a few minutes, I had to read just another page or even just another paragraph. Her descriptions are quite superb and she takes plenty of time with her characters, developing them so well that I feel like I know them.  This is a haunting tale, with lots of twists and turns and it will keep you busy with speculations right up to the end, where it finishes as dramatically as it begins. So, settle in for the night, take the phone off the hook, and get comfortable. You're going want to be there for awhile.
B004GGQMRY|5.0|Rain Man is the story of Charlie and Raymond Babbitt, who until the death of their father Sanford, have been separated from each other for much of their lives. Charlie didn't even know that he had a brother until this occasion. Raymond is autistic, and it is the coming together of the brothers that is the narrative of this film, which is highly engaging and entertaining, as they learn more about each other whilst travelling across America by car, to Charlie's home in California. The journey is very much one of discovery, as forgotten events of the past are unraveled and Charlie has to quickly adapt to the needs of Raymond, with patience and understanding. This is the film that confirmed Tom Cruise as a highly capable drama actor, and Dustin Hoffman deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Actor in a leading role, for his superb performance as Raymond. It is an enlightening movie that will forever charm audiences.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
0385738765|4.0|This book (book 2 in The Maze Runner trilogy) picks up right where The Maze Runner left off. As mentioned in my review of The Maze Runner, James Dashner is an amazing writer, and his writing remains up to snuff in this second installment. Once again the book opens with an intense and intriguing opening that immediately pulls the reader right into the story, but this time we are shoved into a room cramped with the surviving gladers, but we already know things are going to be bad.<br /><br />\\"She spoke to him before the world fell apart.\\"<br /><br />I felt the pacing was a bit off with this novel. I was often left wondering what was really going on, why they were where they were, and what everything meant. It felt a little slapped together to be honest. It wasn't nearly as scary and creepy as The Maze Runner, and the whole back and forth thing with Theresa was just plain annoying.<br /><br />Thomas felt completely detached from the rest of the group, which I am sure was part of the point, but it just seemed like all those relationships that were built up in The Maze Runner didn't matter at all and were a waste of space. I hope things come together better in The Death Cure.<br /><br />Another thing that really annoyed me was the whole thing where Thomas would meet someone new, debate whether he should basically tell them his whole life story, then decide he either can trust them or has no other choice, and then those characters have no real main part in the book. Again it just feels like filler...and annoying filler at that...<br /><br />I guess it just felt like overall there wasn't enough surprises to keep my interest, especially since I knew there would be one more book. I find most trilogies tend to slack in the second book...almost as if there really should have been only two books in the first place.<br /><br />The chapters were kept short, yet involved, which keeps the readers interested and coming back for more. So that's a plus. There were also a few new characters added that made the story interesting, and hopefully continue to do so into The Death Cure. The writing was fantastic as was to be expected, just felt jumpy and unnecessary at times. Overall it was still a very enjoyable read, despite my complaints. It was interesting to see what happened to all the surviving gladers after they thought they were finally safe from the maze.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who loved the first one, and plans on finishing the series off with The Death Cure.ontinue to do so into The Death Cure.

B005HSG3TC|4.0|I don't often write reviews, but this cover deserves it. This is an excellent cover with great fit and finish. The Fire is already a very durable device with a rubberized backing, so this thing mainly completes the picture with a handy strap and something to cover the front. It has a very elegant look and seems like it'll last a long time, but of course, time will tell. I'd give it five stars, but I cant figure out what to do with the front flap when using the strap in back to hold the unit.

B002KKCWIG|5.0|I've had several pairs of Teva footwear in the last 10 years.  These are among the best.  I bought them for a Hawaii trip and they did not disappoint.    Like any new shoe, they took a little break-in time and some adjustment to find the right fit.  They went everywhere I needed them to.  Sea water, hiking, and even a lava tube were no match for these.  Incredibly comfortable and securely fit the entire time.  The sole is very thick and is extremely shock-absorbent.  The bottom of your feet are impervious to anything while the top soaks in the sun.

B0026ZNL80|5.0|Oh  my  goodness  !  W o W.  I got this album as a gift.  First experience with this band.  Hoping for something along the lines of Dream Theater.  What I got is something that I wished DT would aspire to.  This album knocked me off my feet and I shared it with many friends who enjoy rock and metal music.  Not that I have many friends but anyway...I will be getting to know this band more.  You should to.  Some thoughts on the songs:<br /><br />1) Hyperactive: Great way to start the album.  Nice piano line that morphs into some dirty, crunchy guitars and beautiful, heavy drumming.  Musical bursts, punctuated by pregnant moments of silence and then launching again into heavy, bass-deep passages with swirling, hyperactive keyboards coming in and out.  Frequent transitions and instruments popping in and out all the while keeping a nice frenetic pace.  Vocals oddly soothing despite the musical maelstrom ensorceling them.  10/10.  Fantastic.<br /><br />2) Driven To Destruction: Thought the opener was fantastic?  (It was.)  Get ready for another dose of fantastic.  D2D starts off with a whopping rubber-band bass guitar that is simply fun.  A musical refrain is added and then played with as some guitars have some snarly fun in the background of the song.  The song moves along at a brisk place and the singer, starting off singing calmly builds and briefly breaks into a scream (don't worry, though, no screamo here).  As the song moves on it waxes and wanes between elegant and mysterious passages and blasts of rock goodness (I kid you not, the keyboards and Hammond Organ pound it out along with the guitar whacks).  Never a dull moment!  10/10.<br /><br />3) Egoist Hedonist: This song sounds like a condensed soundtrack to a really, really good thriller movie that hooks you immediately with the surprise abduction of the seemingly innocent femme fatale, breaks into moments of run-for-your life surprises and escapes, gets meatier with the introduction of the \\"things aren't quite what they seem\\" elements, and ending with a very satisfying heavy romp where the evil woman gets what she planned for others and the hero escapes her clutches, but just barely.  The bass playing is delicious and infectious and crying, driving guitars overlay and play with the infectiousness.  There are a variety of keyboard sounds and effects throughout the song and they add an immense variety and interest to the piece; they are like the connective tissues to the body of the song.  At 6:38 a tasty guitar movement comes in, fades out, and then comes back in.  And that's one of the things that I'm liking about this CD.  There is a lot of variety in the tones and textures of the sounds while they play off of and repeat off of each other.  It is an exciting listen.  You're probably not going to believe this but another 10/10.<br /><br />4) Left Out: Okay.  After the first three songs which have significant moments of heaviness to them and a lot of forward momentum and energy we come to the slow song on the album.  It is quiet, reflective, pensive.  Somber.  The song sustains this mood until about the 4:30 mark where it breaks through a wall and rocks a bit and then goes somber again.  Breaks that wall again at around the 5:40 mark only to go somberish.  With some thick, finger-licking bass guitar work the dynamics slowly build, bubble, build and bubble, bubble and bubble, bubble and bubble and boil.  Very satisfying.  9/10.<br /><br />5) Hybrid Times: The last song on the disc begins with a nice piano intro, pleasant singing (did I mention that I like Mariusz Duda's voice?), and then a rollover into heaviness.  This song is like an NFL linebacker who's got the ball on the opponent's 2 yard line and makes an incredible run to score a did-you-see-that! and that! and that! touchdown.  He feints, jukes, spins, hurdles opponents, gets grabbed and taken back several feet, powers out of the hold, gets hit high and low but somehow against the laws of physics and gravity stays up, facemasks a rival, outruns his blocker and sails into his endzone before finally coasting to a stop.  Whoa.  I'm out of breath!  There's so much going on in this song and every bit of it works.  Time and signature changes.  Guitar solos.  Dancing keyboard blips and rhythms.  Slow to fast to slow tempos.  Surprise moments like the screaming guitar (keyboard effect?) around the 8:25 point.  Syncopation and reverb.  Singing.  Snarling.  Shouting.  Again, never a dull moment.  I suppose that many people would pick either track 1, (especially) 2, or 3 as their favorite track on the album.  All good choices.  But for me track 5 is the standout.  It's also the longest.  It's not just fantastic.  It's not just very satisfying.  It's brilliant.  10/10.<br /><br />This may be the best and most exciting CD I've heard in the last 5 years.

0316069884|3.0|The book gives all the evidence against industrial farming that we all have heard before. There is some humor and nice cultural references thrown in to make the book an enjoyable read but the author completely ignores why he can rationalize eating dairy and eggs but not meat.  I feel it is wrong to use all animal products hut understand that many do not share my views. I was so dissapointed that there was no explanation for this.  For someone to strongly preach against animal cruelty and then use leather, fur, down, wool or at eggs or dairy I find that to be hypocritical and at the very least deserving discussion.
B002MU4NL8|5.0|My better half and I love this movie!  After returning from a recent trip to Europe, we thought we would get over our jetlag by relaxing and watching something funny before heading off to bed.  I pulled out the DVD (we still had not unwrapped it after receiving it from Amazon), put it in the player and---whoa!  The quality is just poor!  The disc looks like the action is in slow motion in some places; in others the audio is out of sync.  The list of quality faults goes on...<br /><br />If you've got the original disc, keep it.  Don't buy the blu-ray version!
B003XT603Q|1.0|Based on the high reviews of the book and the author, I got this book, Norwegian Wood, to read while travelling in Europe.  Without fail, and regardless of whether I was tired or rested, this book put me to sleep.<br /><br />At the price of US$5.99, it is cheaper by far than a prescription sleep aid and cheaper than over the counter sleep aids with no known side effects.<br /><br />I guess I'll keep it as a cheap sleep inducer to replace textbooks and technical manuals.  It's a lot smaller and lighter.
0802798225|5.0|Perfect Chemistry brings us into the lives of Brittany and Alex, two seemingly very different people from opposites sides of town. She's rich, he's poor - she's white, he's latino - she's popular, he's in a gang. So what happens when they get paired up as chemistry partners in school and are forced to be around each other?<br /><br />Oh, starcrossed lovers never gets old with me! What IS it about the boy from the wrong side of the tracks or the girl who everyone thinks is vapid and shallow but is secretly awesome? This is told from both Alex and Brittany's points of view and I don't think the book would have worked well without it. If things had been one sided, you might have thought less of the person whose perspective wasn't being told. I loved seeing how they started at two different points, went through their separate journeys, and then finally came together and met halfway. Don't shy away from this book if you think it's \\"just another starcrossed lovers' tale\\" - it's so much more than that! It's about what people are willing to do for those that they love.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book for contemporary fans, especially if you love a great LOVE story because Ms. Elkeles sure does know how to make things steamy!

B0053YGYO4|5.0|I bet you didn't know that.  I really like this release.  Every song on it is good.  Chris Martin is a great vocalist.  Thank you for reading.  I love you all.
B005XOPEOU|5.0|I admit I wasn't entirely sure of what to expect of this new album, but now that I've listened to most of the songs a couple times over my opinion is slowly changing from my first listen. I wasn't immediately blown away my first listen like I was with say 'X&Y' and 'Viva La Vida,' which are incredible albums, but it has certainly started to grow on me. There's a few songs that I'll skip as I listen through but overall there's some really great songs in this album.  The album begins with the title 'Mylo Xyloto,' which is an instrumental introduction, somewhat similar to the instrumental intro to 'Viva La Vida,' 'Life in Technicolor,' but you can already tell that this album is going to be much more experimental and atmospheric just off of this alone.   The next track is quite possibly my favorite, 'Hurts Like Heaven' which picks up where 'Mylo Xyloto' left off in a very upbeat, positive tune with all kinds of crazy chiming and distortion effects that we've never heard from Coldplay, but I like it.  Most likely if you're reading this review, then you've heard the next track 'Paradise' which is an incredible single that's a bit more reminiscent of Coldplay's last album but with a bit more distortion and liveliness. This song is probably a bit more poppish than the rest of the album.  'Charlie Brown' is one of the songs that took some time to grow on me. The eerie chanting at the beginning was a little bit unusual when I first heard the song but the more I listen to it the more I feel that it fits into the album. Chris Martin's vocals for some reason oddly remind me a bit of Brandon Flowers from The Killers in this song as does the tempo. Regardless, it's a great song, the instrumentals slightly remind me of 'Lovers in Japan.'  'Us Against the World' hasn't totally grown on me yet, but I feel that if I listen to it the right time on the right day I'll develop a fondness to it. It's a bit slower than the previous four songs, but it's a nice slow break that leads into another excellent song.  'M.M.I.X.' and 'Every Teardrop is a Waterfall' basically fit into one song as 'M.M.I.X' is basically an instrumental interlude. You should probably have already developed an opinion on 'Every Teardrop is a Waterfall' and if you think the rest of the album is going to be like this album then you would be wrong, not that that's good or bad, I love this song and I love this album. I think the only reason you would not like this song is if you're one of those people who feels like displaying emotions is emasculating. I can't help but feel inspired this song, it makes me want to get up and run.  So now it gets a little darker with 'Major Minus' which has been available for listening for a couple of months on their YouTube page. It's a bit of a conspiracy theorist's anthem, but I enjoy listening to it from time to time. I have to say Coldplay really brought out their effects and distortion on this one, but I feel they purposefully did it to get their message across.  Some people have said 'U.F.O' is most like the old, slower Coldplay, and they also feel the song should have been longer, which I would have to agree. It's nice to hear that they haven't entirely broken from their past, though I'm happy they haven't remained complacent in one sound like so many bands do.  This next song was a complete surprise, I had no idea Rihanna was in this album. I'm not a huge fan of Rihanna, but I do believe she's very talented, and this performance was very good. When I first heard this song I wasn't totally engaged, but it's another song that's grown on me, it's very catchy and I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes a single.  'Up in Flames' while being reminiscent of the very old Coldplay isn't really for me, it's just a little too slow and repetitious for me to appreciate. This is one of the songs I would probably skip.  Luckily 'A Hopeful Transmission + Don't Let It Break Your Heart' picks us back up and this is one of those songs that I pretty much fell in love with from first listen. This is probably as good as 'Hurts Like Heaven' and it has a very similar style to that song, but it still holds its own uniqueness.  'Up With the Birds' is a very nice close to the album, though I have to admit they have had better closes ('Til Kingdom Come' and 'Death and All His Friends,' which is by far my favorite closing song from Coldplay).  Overall, I think this is a great new direction for Coldplay, even if they end up going back to their older style, but I don't think that's going to happen, each album they've released has become progressively more and more experimental. I love their old music but if they kept making the same sounding music we might just lose interest. I'm a little surprised at the low rating so far on Amazon, but I'm sure that after a few months that rating will slowly rise as we learn to love this new album.

1400052173|5.0|I ordered this book as it encompassed a number of my interests - social history / science / genetics / biography.....and was not disappointed.  It is an easy read - you don't have to be a whizz at science or genetics to 'get it'.  The author's handling of the subject matter iself, the people involved and the societal norms at the time of the development of the HeLa cell line, whilst not profound is nevertheless very readable and I found it absorbing.  It certainly had me thinking about a range of issues that I hadn't consciously thought about....such as the medical ethic issues raised.  I recommend it.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Avoid Ultraviolet bundles at all costs. Sure, if you have a PC you might have a good streaming experience - if you ISP isn't charging you for the traffic - but you also have a time limit. You probably won't get to watch this movie through Ultraviolet a year from now.  The Ultraviolet web site also has this very kind message that says those of you who bought the Part 1 digital copy will have your streaming rights extended to March 31st, 2012 for your viewing enjoyment.  My spouse bought this so not my dime, so to speak, but I was so ticked off I just went out to iTunes and bought the SD version outright. I also went out to their web site and told them off, the greedy jerks. Now I hear they are giving people iTunes copies because the reaction of many has been fast and furious. A PR blunder. I mean, they've made more money off this franchise than they know what to do with and it still isn't enough.   So I'm happy I have my iTunes copy to complete my set but I'll think twice about giving Warner Bros. any more money than I have to. They are on my list of people I'd rather not do business with.

B0012GMW0C|4.0|make no mistake. this ain't 'faithfully' and 'i'll be alright without you' this is some San-Francisco mix of psychedelia/heavy metal/fusion/santana-esque soul ! founding member gregg rolie (vocals/keyboards) delivers the goods  on 'in a lifetime'- a track that reminds me of my favorite pink floyd song 'echoes'. kohotek, another amazing track,is where schon's guitar really shines and is reminiscent of mahavishnu or early al dimeola. neil schon's guitar playing is front and center & all over  this album (later, he'd have to take the back seat to the radio friendly pop of certain pretty boy chanteuse by the name of steve perry). like other reviewers have mentioned-don't pick this up if you are looking for a hits collection, don't get this. you wanna go on a \\"journey\\"?? a real journey-not that eighties pop rock fm friendly -band- of -cuddly- mtv -sweethearts- from -the -early- eighties-journey?? stylistically very reminiscent  to the rolie-schon lineup of santana band.
B005HV6Y84|2.0|I am very disappointed in this soundtrack. There is no Muse on it and there are songs that have been on previous soundtracks. Hopefully, it will be better once I can put the music with the movie.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|I pre-ordered this cover along with my Kindle Fire, so I didn't have the opportunity to evaluate its reviews. I agree with the other reviewers. Don't buy this cover. Even with the Amazon $10 promotional credit, it is not worth $29.99 ($39.99 - $10.00). It feels & looks cheap. Specific flaw - There is a groove running the length of the back cover that serves as a stand support. The groove is exactly aligned with the USB port. The edge of the groove pokes (not hard, but annoying) when plugging in the power cord. If the groove was aligned elsewhere, I would not have noticed it. I will try it for a few more days, but I think this is going back.

Suffice to say that things finally come full circle and we learn a few more secrets regarding Harry's past.

B004UXUX4Q|5.0|I remember about seven years ago when video rental stores were still in their prime and I frequented Hollywood Video instead of Netflix when I picked up Sideways on a whim, brought it home, and thoroughly enjoyed it but never really had the chance to talk to anybody about it. It was long before I started reviewing movies and most of my friends have the typical guy taste in movies: if there isn't a ton of nudity, blood and violence, or explosion of some kind in the first ten minutes then they essentially get bored with it and fall asleep or turn it off without giving it a proper chance. So I kind of felt like I was this closet Sideways fan for years. Up until The Descendants, it was actually the only Alexander Payne directed film I've had the chance to see as well. With that said, I'm also not the biggest George Clooney fan. His pretentiousness in real life seems to have crossed over into many of his performances and my favorite memories from his acting resume are mostly Seth Gecko from From Dusk 'Till Dawn and Sparky and Dr. Gouache from \\"South Park\\". There have obviously been better movies of his since then (O Brother, Where Art Thou? Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Up In the Air, and Fantastic Mr. Fox are personal favorites), but none have spoken to me the way Seth Gecko did. There has already been quite a lot of Academy Award talk with The Descendants, but Clooney's roles always seem to be associated with The Oscars so that wasn't too surprising. However The Descendants proved to not only be one of Clooney's best on-screen performances but is also one of the best 2011 has to offer.<br /><br />Visually speaking, The Descendants is extraordinary. It's filmed in Hawaii after all, so it's kind of difficult to make it look bad. The scenery is almost overly-beautiful even though much of the film is overcast Hawaii's green landscapes and clear ocean water makes nearly every scene visually striking. Even when it's raining you can't help but feel the urge to visit this amazing place or return there if you've been fortunate enough to have gone to Hawaii before. There's also a staircase scene where we're looking down at Clooney while he's climbing stairs that caught my eye while he narrates about his life which mostly revolves around trying to fix a broken marriage. It sounds so simple on paper, but it's one of those scenes where the camera was in the right place at the right time and makes something so brief memorable.<br /><br />This is easily the most emotional George Clooney has ever been in one of his performances, as well. He's on the brink of a breakdown the entire film and while I would've liked to have seen something a bit more expressive especially after the hype for \\"his first on-screen breakdown,\\" what we do receive is still really emotional and heartfelt. Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller are also fantastic as Matt King's (Clooney) children. They provide many of the laughs a good portion of the film and show they're also fully capable of displaying what feels like sincere sorrow and emotion. That's one of the best things about The Descendants; it provides plenty of hilarious laugh-out-loud moments but also isn't afraid to show you more tender moments that tug at your heartstrings. Alexandra's (Woodley) friend Sid (Nick Krause) is very entertaining, as well. His scenes in the car and at Elizabeth's (Patricia Hastie) parents' house are some of the greatest the film has to offer. Matt's friends Mark (Rob Huebel) and Kai Mitchell (Mary Birdsong) are also a highlight. Mark provides some really hilarious one-liners while Kai is obviously a very devoted friend to Matt's wife Elizabeth.<br /><br />There are little to no faults to be found in the film. The entire cast delivers, the story unravels in a very pleasing fashion, and the film is magnificently shot. There's very little to be unhappy with. Even the Hawaiian music was a high spot. While I'm not the biggest fan of foreign music, this was generally very soothing featuring Hawaiian lyrics accompanied by guitar or ukulele plucking. The one thing that might come off as kind of silly is the Matthew Lillard kitchen scene being fairly reminiscent of the ending to Scream, but that was more humorous than anything.<br /><br />I'm sure it differentiates a bit from critic to critic, but for me the best movies are not only the ones that feature talented casts, engrossing storytelling, and solid scripts but are also the ones that manage to affect a wide range of your emotions. The Descendants does all of that and then some. Every performance feels genuine and the never-ending downward spiral feeling the story gives you is resolved in a way that not only feels natural but is completely satisfying. This is George Clooney at his absolute best and it's safe to say that Alexander Payne has outdone himself. The Descendants is chaotic, charming, hilarious, and emotional. It's quite possibly the most powerful and emotion-evoking film of the year.guitar or ukulele plucking.

0345350499|4.0|I selected this book thanks to a flowchart I found on Reddit outlining NPR's 100 best science fiction and fantasy novels. So far I've been exceedingly pleased with the result, the book is very long and it will supply even the fastest reader with many nights of good reading. The characters are rich and diverse, especially the women, but no less the men. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in medieval fantasy or drama, but also to people who have a taste for philosophy as religious speculation figures prominently in between the major plot events. As someone who is only vaguely familiar with the Arthurian legend, I didn't find it at all hard to understand or follow the plot. The writing is skillful and the pacing is great. Overall a great book.
1451648537|5.0|Many start-up founders with creative ideas are often afraid of the responsibilities execution brings as being creative robs them of self discipline needed to tend to the boring details. I often come across people at startup related meetups that want to know if idea and creativity is worth as much as the discipline to execute ideas and bring them to reality. Others are interested in knowing if a non technical founder can effectively become a CEO of the company.    This book is for them!    Steve Jobs was one such non techie when he started so young at solving problems he had never experience before and was dependent on his partner to actually solve much of the technical puzzles of his time. His creative vision and ability to execute outweighed his shortcomings and his success transformed industries like music, phones, mobile computing, animation, electronics like camera, gps, software distribution, etc.     Why wouldn't you want to know about such a rare man?

B001UV4XJ2|4.0|The movie was action-packed for the most part. It's the darkest in the series, and is appropriately manifested with drawn-out colors during most of the film. This makes special effects such as battle of the wands even more spectacular!  The 1080p picture for the most part are clear and detailed. There are some smearing but those are in the background. The audio (DTS-HD 5.1) is fabulous: voice and sound are clean and clear, and sound effects have directional sense.  Haven't tried the ultra-violet, but I am totally against it and hated it. I prefer to have copy that sit on my PC server or my smart phone or iPad, playable locally without external connections.  If it wasn't for the combo pack (3D/DVD), I would just get the single one or complete collection. 3D is exclusive to Best Buy so I returned this to Amazon in favor of the 3D combo pack.
0393338959|5.0|This book was required reading for an MBA-level course I am taking entitled \\"Public Policy and Business Performance,\\" along with a handful of other texts including \\"Naked Economics\\" by Kent Whelan, \\"A Concise Guide to Macroeconomics\\" by David A. Moss, and \\"New Ideas from Dead Economists\\" by Todd Buchholz (as well as countless other scholarly journal articles representing a variety of publications). Because I have worked for nearly 10 years now at a global commercial real estate firm, I thoroughly enjoyed this book because Stiglitz makes practical sense out of a complex and multi-facted issue that has had a direct impact not only on my industry, but society at large. Specifically he zeroes in on the economic, legislative, and political issues that ultimately created the social issues, which led to the freefall.   As the former Senior Vice President and Chief Economist of the World Bank and a Nobel-prize winning economist, Stiglitz brings unique perspective to the issues we are facing today and how we can work to overcome them. He presents his arguments in an engaging and fact-supported way, sprinkled with global insight. Some of my favorite quotes from the book include:  -\\"Historically, there have been repeated instances of banks using other people's money to engage in excessive risk-taking and to lend to those who can't repay. There have been repeated instances of such lending giving rise to housing bubbles. It's one of the reasons for regulation.\\" - page 80  -\\"The U.S. government did something worse than trying to re-create the financial system of the past: it strengthened the too-big-to-fail banks; it introduced a new concept - too-big-to-be-financially-resolved. It worsened the problems of moral hazard; it burdened future generations with a legacy of debt; it cast pallor of the risk of inflation over the U.S. dollar; and it strengthened many Americans' doubts about the fundamental fairness of the system.\\" - page 145  -\\"It is said that tax systems reflect the values of society. One of the strange aspects of the U.S. tax system is that it treats speculators who gamble better than those who work hard for a living.\\" - page 181  -\\"In the crisis, some firms complained that they didn't want to take on as much leverage as they did (they realized the risk) but if they hadn't, they wouldn't have had survived. Their return on equity would have been low, market participants would have misinterpreted the low return as a result of lack of innovativeness and enterprise, and their stock price would have been beaten down. They felt they had no choice but to follow the herd.\\" - page 273  -\\"The failures in our financial system, and the failures of our economic system reflect deeper problems in our society. We began the bailouts without a clear sense of what kind of financial system we wanted at the end, and the result has been shaped by the political forces that got us into the mess. We have not changed our political system, so we should perhaps not be surprised by any of this\\" - page 295  Stiglitz concludes the book by proposing a re-evalution of the \\"swash-buckling model of rugged American individualism\\" and free-market fundamentalism that has led to not only an erosion of trust, but the emergence of a mentality that is prohibiting the natural outgrowth of a new and necessary economic model that better fits the needs of our society. He suggests re-thinking GDP so that we can better measure what we value ... for example not basing the health of our economy on individual output alone, but rather taking into account such additional measures as effectiveness of health care, education, and general well-being.

He loves to pretend he's talking on the phone,(we pretended to talk on it when we got it so he understood it's a phone, because nowadays phones don't look like that so I'm not sure he would have recognized it as a phone), and he likes turning the rotary dial and hearing the noise. I personally like that it's a simple classic and not yet another noisy electronic toy requiring batteries.

0307593312|4.0|I love this book! During the first few chapters, I really thought that Murakami was going to thread into pedophilia and am glad I was wrong. Some ultra-conservative would say that he did but I beg to differ. The book is well-written and the story flow so smoothly. I have no idea if the english translation is accurate but to me it is just perfect.   I sensed a hint of Vonnegut in Murakami's work albeit this is the first book I have read of his. All the characters, even the villains, are likeable, especially ushukawa. His character is deplorable, however, you will feel somehow sorry for him - or sympathetic.  I am a new Murakami fan, and I will read his other books. The only thing I didn't like about 1Q84 is the ending - so unexpectedly uneventful. I was hoping for a climactic ending. Nevertheless, this is an excellent read.

0375703764|5.0|\\"Little solace comes<br />to those who grieve<br />when thoughts keep drifting<br />as walls keep shifting<br />and this great blue world of ours<br />seems a house of leaves<br /><br />moments before the wind. (p.563)\\"<br /><br />Defining Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves is like asking a five year old to describe the Riemann Hypothesis.  House of Leaves is, on its fringes, a story about the Reader.  In the Introduction by Johnny Truant, we're flat out told that what we're reading is a product from a manuscript he found in the room of a dead man named Zampan&ograve;.  The manuscript, as it turns out, is a scholarly work based on a documentary Zampan&ograve; has become obsessed with: The Navidson Record.  And if House of Leaves is about anything at all--its heart, its cornerstone, its foundation--then it's about The Navidson Record.<br /><br />Will Navidson is a critically acclaimed photojournalist.  Years of life spent away from his long-time partner Karen Green, a former cover model, and his two children, Chad and Daisy, has the Navidson family barreling towards non-existence.  Will and Karen decide to purchase a quaint Virginia house and settle down and work on their family.  Will seeks to finish his career with a simple documentary on their new lives in their new home.  He installs video cameras throughout the house, motion sensors to pick up when activity is going on, and settles in for a calm retirement.<br /><br />But everything does not go as planned.  The house seems odd, and one day, for no apparent reason, Will and Karen discover a new closet situated outside their bedroom door.  Baffled, Will gets the floor plans and begins going through measurements, confused.  And when he discovers that the house measures larger on the inside than it does on the outside, the groundwork is laid for the rest of the \\"movie.\\"<br /><br />The Navidson Record is as tantalizing as it is terrifying.  The house on Ash Tree Lane is creepy and dark.  Navidson, an explorer at heart, sets out to understand the house and its unnerving black (and apparently unending) labyrinth of hallways that appears in its center.<br /><br />Zampan&ograve;'s manuscript exhaustively covers the film, from its subtle and serene beginnings to its haunting and stunning conclusion.  His work is littered with footnotes, and as Truant tells us at the onset, many of these footnotes' references simply do not exist in real life.  Keeping this in mind, the remainder of the manuscript makes for a fascinating exploration of the film, sometimes mind-numbingly so.<br /><br />\\"As I discovered, there were reams and reams of it. Endless snarls of words, sometimes twisting into meaning, sometimes into nothing at all, frequently breaking apart, always branching off into other pieces I'd come across later--on old napkins, the tattered edges of an envelope, once even on the back of a postage stamp; everything and anything but empty; each fragment completely covered with the creep of years and years of ink pronouncements; layered, crossed out, amended; handwritten, typed; legible, illegible; impenetrable, lucid; torn, stained, scotch taped; some bits crisp and clean, others faded, burnt or folded and refolded so many times the creases have obliterated whole passages of god knows what--sense? truth? deceit? a legacy of prophecy or lunacy or nothing of the kind?, and in the end achieving, designating, describing, recreating--find your own words; I have no more; or plenty more but why? and all to tell--what?\\" (p.xvii)<br /><br />But still yet, in an even further removed frame, the Reader understands (again, at the beginning of the novel, so as to keep SPOILER-FREE) that we're also reading Johnny Truant's annotations of Zampan&ograve;'s manuscript.  Truant's story begins in the Introduction, and as it unfolds throughout the footnotes, we discover how the manuscript affects him.  Truant is a mesmerizing POV, as one of the first things he tells us is that he's unreliable.  And as we read, both the manuscript and the footnotes, we're constantly left puzzling over what's been altered, if anything.  This, as the Reader will undoubtedly understand, is disorienting and intentional.  And as we come to understand Truant's background, especially concerning the Whalestoe Letters, what's real and what's not comes under even more scrutiny.<br /><br />To me, the most interesting part of the book deals with the darkness inside the house.  Danielewski a la Truant a la Zampan&ograve; paint a vivid picture of the blackness, the absence of light within the house.<br /><br />\\"The walls are endlessly bare. Nothing hangs on them, nothing defines them. They are without texture. Even to the keenest eye or most sentient fingertip, they remain unreadable. You will never find a mark there. No trace survives. The walls obliterate everything. They are permanently absolved of all record. Oblique, forever obscure and unwritten. Behold the perfect pantheon of absence.\\" (p.423)<br /><br />I know what dark is.  I live in the state with the largest cave system in the world.  I've been to the depths of the earth and had the lights extinguished, propelled into absolute darkness, a blackness so thick that one can't help but despair.  And yet, the darkness within the house seems darker.  This has definitely played upon my mind at night as I've roamed the halls of my own house, and I confess to a quickened pulse a time or two.<br /><br />Another part that must be addressed is the bizarre formats used.  This was the primary reason I wanted to read the book, and after finishing, I enjoyed the way the book was presented.  The Reader has to flip the book, turn it sideways, and go through mental hoops to read certain passages, but it definitely adds to the story.  I read the full color edition, which is the author's preferred edition, as it includes over two-hundred pages of appendices, filled with more fascinating puzzle pieces (and if you read the book, I recommend following the instructions to see the Appendix before continuing on with the novel) and I can't imagine reading this book any other way.<br /><br />So what is House of Leaves?  It's a book containing four stories, one woven story, some spelled out more than others, some flat out ignored.  It's meta.  It's contained.  It's puzzling.  It's erudite, so keep a dictionary very close.  It's compelling.  It's tedious.  It induces smiles and wicked grins, but groans and sighs.  It's beautiful.  It's art.  It's a love story.  It's disgusting and leaves one needing a bath.  It's definitely not for the faint of heart or those offended by crude sex.  It is a remarkable read, leaving the Reader satisfied and immediately ready to dive back in again to see what's missed, but at the same time worn down and betrayed.  If Danielewski intended this, then he succeeded.  I enjoyed House of Leaves immensely and would love to discuss it with someone (thankfully there are forums devoted to it).  It's easy to recommend.<br /><br />[Note: To get the full-color review, go to my blog @ [...]ing.  This, as the Reader will undoubtedly understand, is disorienting and intentional.

B005POK858|5.0|I have to say this game was fun. I'm a huge fan of RPGs. Most Android rpgs suck but, this game was a lot of fun.  Easy story to fallow I love the 8/24bit idea. Brings back the childhood games like Zelda. My only problem was the game didn't have a quest log. A few times I found myself struggling trying to pick up where I left off. Other than that I enjoyed this.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|I pre-ordered this version when it was first announced because I didn't care to have all the special features but still wanted the movies.  Since I knew a box set would be coming out, my patience has been somewhat rewarded by this product.  However, you do get what you pay for, and given the cheap per unit rate that I paid for (which is around $10 per movie), I am pleased with the purchase.<br /><br />It is disappointing to learn that this is just a repackaging of the existing Blu-ray discs that are currently in other sets, as well as the lack of proper representation of the disc art as photographed by the product image in this listing.  But these are just minor complaints.<br /><br />Again, I was not looking for a LOST style box set, with feelies and loads of extras that are just as long as the movies themselves.  I was looking for a collection that had all the movies so I could revisit and enjoy them all over again.  And for that, I'm happy with this purchase and this product.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|Even after the $10 reduction, this case isn't worth $30. It doesn't really work as a stand (despite the pictures portraying it as such). The lid isn't secured when folded back by putting it in the shallow, perhaps 1/32 in deep, seam. Folding the lid the other way provides no real support.<br /><br />It also seems to provide poor shock protection on the front, where the lid is a thin, hard sheet -- offering no padding and little rigid protection.<br /><br />Less importantly, the fit is so snug it is impractical to put on and off regularly. Sorry.
0765365278|5.0|Beginning a ten book series can be daunting.  It takes a kind of commitment that many of us just don't have the time for.  It takes effort to stick with a single story for a decade, gobbling up installments every year or so.  We're an impatient people, by and large, and waiting is something we loathe.  Just look at the vitriol surrounding GRRM's prolonged release of A Dance with Dragons.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Brandon Sanderson's The Way of Kings, Book One of The Stormlight Archive, delivers such an impressive story that it's impossible to resist.  The hardcover spans over one thousand pages, but it's populated with beautiful internal artwork that goes right along with the story, not to mention the mesmerizing cover art.<br /><br />TWoK is difficult to summarize succinctly.  Roshar is a land wracked and ravaged by storms.  These storms are ferocious and lethal, with winds and rain strong enough that to be caught out in them is to die.  In part, these storms have shaped the geography, ecology, and sociology of the ten countries that make up Roshar.  Some animals have developed rock-shells for protection.  In some lands, the grass even recedes.  The creatures and places of Roshar are as much a story as the main characters.  It's obvious Sanderson has labored and put thought into his grand epic, and the thrill of experiencing these unusual settings is absolutely delightful.<br /><br />But more than this, tWoK is a tight focused tale centering on a trio of characters.  Kaladin, this novel's major POV character, has wanted to fight in the war on the Shattered Plains for years, and he's finally found himself there, though as a branded member of a bridge crew.  Bridgemen are lower than slaves, especially the bridgemen of Sadeas' warcamp.  To be a bridgeman is to have a death sentence.  Dalinar Kholin, brother to the murdered king that started the war and uncle to the reigning king, is a man of honor and does thing the Old Ways.  He will not let himself get entangled in the squabble of politics and quests for power, much to the chagrin of the other generals, and insists on doing things Right.  But when Dalinar begins having vicious dreams during the highstorms, rumors circulate the warcamps that the Blackthorn is  losing his mind.  And Dalinar can't help but wonder the same.  The third major player is Shallan, a girl who's family is plunged into impossible debt after the patriarch dies.  Shallan decides to seek out Jasnah, the king's heretic sister, and steal her Soulcaster.  She'll use the money to free her family, and possibly survive the quarreling houses.  But the more Shallan learns about Jasnah, the more she begins to question her motives.<br /><br />These three characters are the major players of tWoK, but they are by far not the only ones.  Sanderson has crafted a dramatis personae filled with memorable characters, from the enigmatic Szeth-son-son-Vallano, a Truthless Shin and an angst-driven assassin, to the equally enigmatic Wit, who I'll keep silent about, to Adolin, Dalinar's up-and-coming heir apparent and established warrior on the Plains.  Each person has a wealth of information and life in them, and I eagerly look forward to seeing them all develop over the course of the series.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson is widely known for his unique magic systems, and tWoK does not fail here.  In fact, if you've read any other Sanderson, you'll certainly notice some similarities between the magic systems, but also some very original concepts, too.  As this is Book One, there was a lot introduced, but also a lot of mystery left behind the magics waiting to be revealed.<br /><br />I could go on and on about this book, and I really haven't scratched the surface.  The Way of Kings is a solid first novel for a series.  It wraps up a lot of things, not leaving too many cliff hangers, but not enough to lull the excitement, either.  The stories about these characters--all of them, not just the three primaries--are amazing.  Sanderson knows how to turn a phrase, as well as keep the reader turning pages, and the plot never dies down during this massive read.  If you want a completely different epic fantasy, one that leaves you eager for the next volume and filled with a sense of wonder and awe, then I heartily recommend The Way of Kings.  I'm invested for the duration of the series, and I cannot wait to see where Sanderson takes us.<br /><br />[...]reader turning pages, and the plot never dies down during this massive read.

B0050DZN4K|5.0|It's a shame to see Feedly getting low reviews because of Kindle Fire compatibility issues (which are the fault of Amazon not including core Google services in the Fire's limited version of Android).  I'm a gadget freak, and I regularly use Feedly on a variety of devices ... iPhone, iPad, Android Phone, Android Tablet.  I was looking forward to using Feedly on the Kindle Fire, but quickly ran into the same logging in to Google Reader failure that others have complained about.  At this point, I contemplated sending the Kindle Fire back to Amazon, as my primary goal for the Fire was as a book reader and news reader.  I saw the comments from Feedly posted to other reviews indicating that this problem was addressed in version 7, and that it was coming soon.  Version 7 is already in the Android Market, so I downloaded it there on another Android device and sideloaded it to the Fire.  I'm liking the Kindle fire a lot better now.  Hopefully the version in the Amazon market will get updated to version 7 soon so that these low ratings don't hold Feedly back!

B001HNE3NO|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read. It is so touching, sad, but you can't put it down.  I have always read alot and since I received my kindle as a gift, I have read alot of books on it.  This is probably my favorite.  A book like this has alot of historical facts that I didn't know and things that I didn't realize happened.  I was saddened by so much of what happened.  I have seen that this is being made into a movie and know it will be a hit.  So, if you read one book this year, you need to pick this one.  I guarantee you won't be sorry.
1451627289|4.0|I'll make this short, because its 1:00 a.m., and I just finished the book. This book is a massive 850 pages: The first third of the book was classic King, with an ensemble small down caste and fairly rapid action. The middle third was fairly slow going, spending alot of time on character development, but still managed to make me feel engrossed with the story. The final third I wont give away, only to say that you'll almost surely feel emotionally attached to the conclusion. Overall, I'd place it not in the top 5 of kings books, but possibly in the top 10.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Long time android user and I've used every keyboard (you name it,  I've probably used it).   My top choice of keyboard for Android phone is SwiftKey X.  My second choice is Thumb Keyboard.  Let me explain.   If you only own an Android smart phone,  this keyboard will cut your keystrokes from 100 keys to 35 keystrokes.  The only reason I give it 4.5 stars is because as incredible the predictions has been,  over time my library of predictions has built too large for SwiftKey to predict my next word.  In other words, I still have to type the first letter of the word.   For smartphone you can't really top SwiftKey.  Must buy (better than: Thumb Keyboard, Flext9, Swyle).   If you own an Android smartphone & tablet, I give the edge to thumb keyboard.  Reason is because thumb keyboard can split the keys for easier reach to your thumbs but downside is you have to type the first letter of the word before it gives you predictions.   Long story short, as of today \\"this is the best keyboard you can find\\".
B005V4FJC4|1.0|Every time I hear this chick's voice it makes me want to punch a baby. This album sucks so hard that I almost left it money on the end table. When I hear that stupid Cotton commercial sang by this same chick I want to stick a needle in my ear. Yes I bought this album for my wife (at her request) and we both can't stand it even with her strong love for M. Ward. Take a huge pass on this unless you're so overly in love with Zooey that you can't help yourself. It has the same old rehashed melancholy Christmas songs that are better performed by classic artists. If you happen to be sitting by the Ol' yule log, keep the flames alive by throwing this \\"log\\" in as well.
B005D51JQQ|1.0|Accountants control the music industry, not artists.  They don't want new, original, challenging music because it's unquantifiable in $ terms. They want to repackage old hits because it's easy, and its very profitable. They know it sells because it always has done. The revenue is predictable and underwrites the bottom line of large corporations. That's why Message in a Bottle and Every Breath You Take keep appearing year after year in various formats: remastered, remixed, acoustic, live, live acoustic, orchestral, instrumental, jazz version, CD, HDCD, DVD, Blue-ray, by The Police, by Sting's band, by Sting solo, and on and on.   My advice to Sting is to stop making music. You've done some great work but it's time to let it go. Find another challenge for the remaining years of your life. There is some fascinating work currently being done into artificial intelligence and black holes. Enrol at Stanford or MIT. Or try your hand at Shakespeare on the stage. Or writing novels. Or designing furniture. Or painting. Push yourself. Do anything. Just don't be a party to any more of this.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|This was my first book by Sophie Kinsella.  I liked it alot.  It is as if she is thinking things that I would think about a situation.  I have already read a couple more books by her.  It is really entertaining and she gets in alot of scraps.  I think this is really more of a girl, lady book and doubt that the guys would like it.  It's light and funny.  I know you will like it.
B005HQ5S3G|1.0|Man, I was so excited to see another album from her, but after listening to the samples I can't understand why people are claiming this is her best album.  The first half especially is way over produced and the up tempo songs all have the same beat and they do drown out her fantastic voice.  I can't believe the producer and mixer yet alone label execs allow this to come out this way.  The writing is decent and shows much more diversity on the last 1/3.  The 4 extra songs on the deluxe are among the better songs on the album.  The first two singles sound the same and are pretty disappointing.  Her first two albums are her strongest and she is getting more and more misdirected.  Kelly needs to grow without selling out. If this album is merely a release to make money she needs to maintain integrity and become \\"Miss independent.\\"  Kelly needs to stand up and request her own producer or drop labels because they are holding her back and she is getting lost among mediocre artist.  She needs to take a cue from Miranda Lambert's new release.  That is a fantastic album showcasing her talent and diversity.  Kelly 's strength is her singing and it gets buried under bland beats.  Definitely stick with her other albums, Breakaway is probably her best.

B004LROUNG|5.0|This is a really good book.  I have read alot of John Grisham's books.  Most of them I liked, but some that got into alot of legal talk didn't interest me.  This has a story and is really funny at times. You feel like you are right there.  It shows the true picture on the people in the book and they are true to life.  I think of someone I know who is like that person and thats how I visualize them. I read it in a couple days and could not put it down.  Even if you have never read John Grishams books, you gonna love this one.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|Like it very much.  It is handy and light weight with no cord to mess with.  It is just the thing for a quick pickup of lint and hair.
B0034G4ORM|5.0|I reluctantly rented this thru my satellite PPV service and was surprisingly, thoroughly entertained.  And, having US Marines be the good guys in a modern Hollywood movie made it so I had to buy this Blu-ray/DVD combo pack to show my support for the filmmakers. Don't listen to the critics. If you enjoy an action-packed, smart, entertaining, moving, sci-fi flick then get this! If you dislike America, US soldiers, etc then move along...this won't be for you (Hollywood already pumps out tons more to your liking anyway).
1400052181|2.0|I got this book because I love anything nonfiction, but this one wasn't as enthralling as I hoped it to be.  It did not hold my attention, and therefore, I could not finish it. I am not big on science, but I wanted to know what happened (obviously not bad enough) and felt empathy for the impersonal reality.  There is a mix of science and story of the family including Henrietta, which is a good trade off. The book is kind of confusing because there are a lot of people/characters and the plot is not in perfect chronological order. This book has an insert of pictures of Henrietta and her family which helps make this story all the more real.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Michael Buble has the Christmas Spirit the whole time through. If I could give him ten stars that would be my rating. If you love Christmas music and enjoy the different sound that Michael Buble provides, don't think twice, order this CD for some great yule time cheer.

B0037AGASG|4.0|It is idiotic beyond comparison when someone here compares this to their \\"real music\\" like coltrane or Tori amos. That person  probably needs to get out more often.  This maybe poppy, sappy and any other -py one would want to add, but it works for the intended market, in this case my 10 year old daughter, who loves this kid. I personally find this boy and his music irritating, but he seems to work hard and make music that my daughter (and her friends at school) simple adore.<br /><br />I do not come back after a hard day's work, open a beer and tell myself, hmm i need to listen to some Justin Bieber to relax. I put on my Johnny Cash records and leave it at that.<br /><br />This music is meant for a target audience and it works.
B004LUS390|5.0|I really like this app and look forward to some doodling whenever I have some down time.  It really is like a mini photoshop, you should get it.
B00511PTWM|4.0|This cigarette lighter adapter is very useful for people that have several artifacts that need power in the car. I use my phone, my iPod, my GPS when driving, especially if it is a long drive.<br /><br />The attachment is very easy to use, just insert in the cigarette lighter and it works. It has a light to show you that it has power.<br /><br />I have to cigarette lighter adapters in my car and found that I could not use it in the front adapter as it interfered with my speed controls. But it works great in the back adapter and since it has a button to set the the adapter it is very sturdy and holds the plugs extremely well.<br /><br />This adapter is very nice and it has a very nice price. I highly recommend it to extend adapters.

B004RFYEEC|5.0|\\" It's Been too long \\"....Been \\" Waiting for the Day \\". And now...  It's \\" Here Today \\". When I listen to the new Smile Sessions Box set, I beam with immense pride in my \\" Boys of Summer. \\"  I remember back in high school...it was about 1966. My friend Dave, and I were gigantic Beach Boys fans. We'd talk about them in class, discuss harmonies, etc. One day this kid chimes in and says,<br />\\" The Beach Boys? They're goofy. They sound like a Barbershop Quartet. \\" I looked at him and said, \\" Yeah, they have great harmonies. \\"  Then he says, \\" Their lyrics don't even make sense. Like in the song, I get Around. They say, \\" All of the guys go steady cause it wouldn't be right, to leave your best girl home on a Saturday night\\". That doesn't make sense. \\"<br /><br />I yelled back, \\" No, no, it's NONE of the guys go steady ! \\" But he wasn't having any of it.... And that's the way it's always been with the Beach Boys. Someone is always finding fault. Remember - in 1966 the BEATLES were kings. Everybody loved the Beatles....( except Dave and me ). And no matter how hard we tried....we just couldn't get thru to the Beatles lovers.<br /><br />Now understand, I have no beef against the Beatles. In fact I like them. And To each his own. I mean, it's America after all. But gee, just listen to the intricate harmonies and complex arrangements that Brian made come to life. They still make the hair at the back of my neck stand up. And tears well up in my eyes. Sometimes I even wait for the Heavens to open up and Angels to come down and join in the Chorus.<br /><br />To some, the Beach Boys Box set will be garbage. They won't like it, get it, or understand any of it. And that's okay.<br />To each his own. But I take great solace in knowing that now, after all these years, I can finally go to my grave with a big fat SMILE on my face. ( And the box set in my casket ).....:)
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I have seen the Kendrick Brothers' previous 3 Sherwood Pictures: Flywheel, Facing the Giants, and Fireproof. Each of those deals with one major theme. In Flywheel it is honesty, in Facing the Giants it is faith, and in Fireproof it is sacrificial love. This one delves into much more territory in about the same amount of time, all within a very complex story. You would not expect a story about several Christian policemen's lives to be as complex as it is. From a message on the need for fathers to be more actively involved in shaping their children, the movie delves into messages of honesty and reaching out to the community. It is the most intense of their 4 movies so far. (My favorite is Fireproof.) The way this one packs so many themes into a story, at such a deep level, shows the Holy Spirit was behind the project. The themes are the basis for the story, rather than an afterthought! As always, Alex and Stephen Kendrick use great humor.
B005I6EU7U|3.0|This cover is very pretty.  I was disappointed that it does not close all the way.

B005NPCJ88|5.0|For me, when I buy a new CD, I have conditioned myself to lower my expectations because of the many duds, and \\"comebacks\\" over the past year.  Admittedly, Five Finger Death Punch holds a special place in my heart, so I went into it with a slight cringe- hoping they did not sell out to the mainstream.  Let me say, I was never more happy to be wrong.  They kept loyal- not only to their fans, but to their sound.  **Contains only over-view of album, no song-by-song descriptions**  Instruments: Down-tuned guitars and explosive drums accompany brutal vocals and a driving bass line.  More room for solos, and a more refined sound, while not giving into the over-produced, auto-tuned craze.  The leads perform very well throughout the album without using many- if any, fillers.  For those softies out there- yes, there is a power ballad (thankfully).  The solo actually sounds like something out of a hair metal band like Whitesnake, believe it or not.  Definitely worth checking out.  Lyrics: While some say they are angst-y, whiny and immature, I say to listen to the lyrics of \\"Remember Everything\\"... very powerful and will hit some people very deeply.  Not all the songs are meant to render you speechless- name me one album that does that.  There are always songs that will hit someone a different way than the person next to them.  For example, a song about a bad childhood would not effect someone who hasn't experienced those feelings, but that does not mean it is a bad song.  Like the instruments, this doesn't seem to have any fillers- except for maybe one.  But even that isnt too bad.  American Capitalist is a stand out, stand alone album that deserves a listen.  Best $8 I have spent in a long time.  5/5.

B0053YGYO4|3.0|So it didn't take a genius to predict what was coming.  The release of \\"Paradise\\" signaled a major shift for Coldplay--with its deep baselines, contagious rhythm, and superficial subject matter masquerading as a much deeper tale.  It soon became painfully clear that they were prepping for a complete crossover into commercial pop, and almost certainly burning bridges along the way.  These elements persist in \\"Every Tear Drop Is a Waterfall\\" and \\"Hurts Like Heaven\\"--the latter of which is made up of equal parts generic British rock and what could conceivably be a Cure cover band's material.  It's not a complete betrayal, however, as Major Minus has some gritty edge and unrefined energy.<br /><br />Despite this huge deviation, the tunes aren't a total loss.  Although the more pretentious members of their fan base will be shouting, \\"Sell Out,\\" after the first note, it is unfair not to give Coldplay a chance to at least try and plead their case.  In the end, it's very likely that the most vocal naysayers will be blasting many of these tracks in the private seclusion of their vehicles, while, at the same time, new--predominantly young--audiences will be proclaiming that they have \\"discovered\\" Coldplay.  Unfortunately, the parallel ends here.<br /><br />Coldplay is synonymous with moodiness, passion, and expressions of disillusionment that materialize in the form of Chris Martin's achingly heartfelt and nuanced delivery.  With Mylo, however, upbeat tracks feel somewhat cheap and out of place, and the ballads sound more like the fluffy, frivolous stuff from which lullabies are woven.  They are saccharine sweet and simply unable to harness the goosebump-inducing power possessed by such predecessors as \\"Scientist\\" and \\"Fix You.\\"  Their calculated and uninspired nature suggests that Martin and his cronies were trying to pass these off as authentic in a desperate attempt to assuage the wounded emotions of their long-time faithfuls.  Although they provide a welcome reprieve from the overall commercialism of the album, they are likely to be quickly forgotten.<br /><br />The most jaw-dropping moment comes about three-quarters through the album, when a completely incongruent R&B track begins.  At this point, most listeners will begin inspecting their decks to assure that they haven't accidentally switched modes.  During this period of fumbling and muttering, it'll happen--Rhianna's voice will begin belting through the speakers with talk of princesses and kings as Martin just plays right along with the absurd charade.  For those who were up in arms over his previous collaboration with Kanye West, this might just be enough to induce wistful reminiscences of \\"Homecoming\\" because--love him or hate him--at least Kanye has a resume that provides supporting evidence of his creative aptitude.<br /><br />So, what's the final verdict?  A few highly accessible and likeable songs provide some cheap thrills.  However, these small perks are quickly overwhelmed by contrived ballads, insipid pop, and ill-fitting themes--namely in the ridiculous duet.  As Coldplay continues in this bold and progressive move away from their roots, they may lose more fans than they gain.  In that case, it might be best for them if audiences wait this one out.  In the meantime, it would be more advisable to take this opportunity to reflect upon the brilliance of Parachutes, X&Y, and A Rush of Blood to the Head--especially since that's where the true spirit of Coldplay resides.rcialism of the album, they are likely to be quickly forgotten.

The middle got bogged down.Sadie was by far the best part of the book . I loved her and of course Jake. Mr. King really is a great author.He really made me feel like I was in those places and when they were racing to save the president , my  heart was racing too. A great what if book. My thanks.

B0065GG2ZK|5.0|Drake, has been dropping beats that has vibrated the walls of my apartment, and the windows of my car for since 2009.  From \\"Headlines\\" - \\"They know, they know, they know..\\" to his track \\"Dreams Money Can Buy\\" where he laid down the statement \\"Too f*****g busy, too busy f*****g,\\" shows where he still has that way to show two sides of every story.  He delivers his lifestyle in two short inverted phrases.<br /><br />  Let us not forget Rihanna steps in with Drake to show a more sensitive side,Drake says: \\"Cause you don't say you love me, To your friend when they ask you, Even though we both know that you do (you do)\\" where a romance was shunned.  Taking it from highs to lows all over the album.<br /><br />  Marvin's Room threw a awesome mix of setting and vocals of a person lost in a world of sex, money, and the fast life with what seems like a little bit of a hidden agenda.  Drake drops \\"I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?, Too many drinks have been given to me\\" where his agenda becomes confused to the woman on the other end of the phone, where she continues to ask \\"Are you drunk right now?\\"<br /><br />  Drake sums it all up in his track \\"Under Ground Kings\\" where he states \\"Rich off a mix tape, got rich off a mix tape\\" where he referenced how he got started back in 2009.  This album was well worth the wait, and it does not come short of what I expected.  Some suggestions, buy the Deluxe version with the (2) extra tracks, 20 total, and keep those Dre Beats turned up to get the full effect of the flows with the solid mixture of bass.
B001NTUAFC|5.0|If you're weighing whether to buy this, you're probably a fan of Pearl Jam or Chris Cornell/Soundgarden/Audioslave and hearing good things about this \\"side project\\" of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam members.  You're also probably thinking that Temple of the Dog is a pretty weird name and...is that play-doh on the cover forming the letters?!!?  TotD was recorded immediately before Soundgarden and Pearl Jam got really big.  Even though I'm a fan of both bands, I think this album is probably better than any Pearl Jam or Soundgarden album.  Honestly.  Superunknown is great.  Ten is great.  This is just a little bit better.  The songs are so well-written and so incredibly performed.  It's a \\"grunge\\" album, I guess, but MUCH more accessible to fans of classic rock or regular hard rock than fans of strictly alternative music.  There's  a lot of the Woodstock-era going on in here, but sort of amped up and fed through a late-80s hard rock filter.  Chris Cornell's voice is just amazing.  Honestly, I was initially hypnotised by the weird beauty of Hunger Strike (and the cool interplay of Eddie Vedder and Cornell's voices), but Cornell is the main lead singer with Vedder appearing only twice, I think.  Every track is singable but never sugary.  The band even dips into gospel-rock a few times (\\"Wooden Jesus,\\" \\"Times of Trouble,\\" and \\"All Night Thing\\").  The most aggressive is \\"Pushin' Forward Back\\" (almost punk in a way, but so melodic you'll be scream-singing along on a second listen).  If you are even a casual fan of ANY grunge or classic rock, this is a must-buy and a perfect album that has stood the test of time and doesn't sound dated in the slightest (again, due to that classic rock influence instead of a 90s sheen).  I cannot recommend it highly enough.
B000003RCY|5.0|Rammstein is the greatest heavy metal band with german lyrics in the world!! I barely understand the songs titles meanings, but the Rammstein sound is really great! I like all the songs but WOLLT IHR DAS BETT IN FLAMMEN, DER MEISTER, ASHE ZU ASHE and LAICHZEIT are high lights! I really recommend RAMMSTEIN to anyone who likes heavy music!
0439023483|5.0|Well written, imaginative and a great read.  Loved each character and never felt like something was missing.  It kept me going and I couldn't put it down.
B004VUP8WK|3.0|I was excited to hear the new Morbid Angel with David Vincent back in the fold, but was kicked in the nuts when I heard the opening tracks. Vincent's attempt to blend his Genitorturers influence into the mix just doesn't work well for Morbid Angel, in fact, it sullies the good name! The actual jammin death metal tracks were decent enough, but the rest....Give me back the old school Morbid Angel that got me into the band in the first place!
B001NPDCFQ|1.0|This is a joke, right? We have heard the virtues of blu ray capacity ad nauseam, so what's up with the growing practice to present in a fancy package what is really a bare-bones release. It's sheer abuse. I already own the Two-Disc Edition of this movie, an upgrade to my previous  copy which is packed with extras. So what excuse can be offered for the failure to include them on the blu ray. Unlike my shelves, it is  not so limited in space, so that's not the problem. It can't be the cost of producing them since it's just a question of including all those from the previous release. This would allow folks lkie myself to divest ourselves of previous copies and maximize that already menitoned limited shelf space. But no- WB would rather milk it for all its worth releasing this making their money and once more release a2nd blu ray with the extrasscrewing the public again.  THey can go to blazes. I'll spend my money on more generous offerings from someone else.
B0002XDODU|5.0|Really like Reise Reise, the forth album by this German heavy metal band! All the songs are good, with some classics like AMERIKA, LOS, DALAI LAMA and KEINE LUST! If you like heavy music, you really recommend RAMMSTEIN!!!!!!
B0000793ZA|5.0|If I only could have five Desert Island Discs, this album would easily be one of them.  It's one of my all-time favorites, and I've been listening to it nonstop since 1984.  Part of it is Lillywhite's brilliant production.  Spacey, atmospheric, it's the sound of old European cities at night.  Perfect mix of guitar and synth.  The songs are great as well.  As one reviewer says, the 1st four songs are outstanding.  I'd have to add \\"The Kick Inside\\" to those four as well.
B005FVFWOI|5.0|This was the record that I listened to regularly for 3 months while I was in college. The new sound is just remarkable. The real star of the show here is Clive Bunker. His drumming makes the whole thing come alive. Jethro Tull had one of the best rhythm sections in rock when Bunker and Glenn Cornick were onboard. Sadly they left before  and after this LP was recorded. The folks that replaced them were second string punching bags. Strictly backup.   I do wish they would go back and digitally remix other great albums.
0307408833|3.0|The recipes in this book are good in theory, but do not always work in the real world.  The measurements are off in how many cupcakes a batch will bake (usually more than the recipe), and the alternative flour mixes are mediocre (they lacked flavor or the right crumb tenderness).  Buy the book for ideas, not tried and true recipes.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I really don´t understand what the lyrics are talking about, cause i don´t speak german...But the Rammstein sound is one of the coolest metals i ever heard! Really like SONNE, ICH WILL, FEUER FREI, SPIELUHR and ZWITTER, in fact i like all the songs...Maybe this is the best album from RAMMSTEIN!  MUTTER is really COOL!!!!
B004LUS390|3.0|I tried this app on both a Thunderbolt (running gingerbread) and an asus tablet (running honeycomb). Overall this is a great app. It is surprising that there is no native support to tablets, although it still works in expanded mode. A second minor annoyance is the fact that there is no landscape support. Working on a phone canvas in portrait gives very limited space, so combined with no tablet support this is very limiting. This leads to the third bug, which is the biggest. The tool to move canvas doesn't work well. The canvas can be moved, but if I move it back I loose the drawing that was outside the phone screen boundary. The information my still be somewhere, but I can't go back and see what was there. In effect, the true canvas size is limited by the phone's screen.
B005G4TJUC|4.0|This is what transformers is all about.  They transform.  They battle.    It's a bit long, and Megan fox was not in it, and if you combine all the films together, you have plenty of unanswered questions.  Some of the main characters could have used some color, but the action and story was MUCH BETTER than the last two films.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Excellent book Nicholas Sparks!!  I hate to finish your books because I have read them all, and they are so much fun to read,  I want more!!  Please have a new book sooner!!
0316098329|4.0|While \\"Room\\" opens with a mother and son in a desperate situation, the book's substance is really the relationship between the son and the mother whose dedication to the son has sustained her over years of captivity. Motherhood gives her a new motivation and reason to carry on, and she creates a world in which her son rarely feels the gravity or reality of their situation. When their world suddenly changes, the story becomes a drastic example of how a child must eventually form his own identity separate from his mother, whether he likes it or not.<br /><br />What makes the book so special is Donoghue's careful, well-developed storytelling which avoids easy sensationalism and stresses the development of character. Another author might exploit the naivete of the 5-year old Jack to cover up plot holes or over-simplify the story, but Jack's maturity and intelligence enable Donoghue to explore the world in  realistic way, even though the situation is unimaginable for most people.<br /><br />The story was compelling and I read through it quickly and stayed up way past my bedtime on a few evenings.
B004LUS390|1.0|This app may be as good as all who say it is but the EULA as presented is very long and in micro-print such that I can't read it.  I am probably the exception but I actually read these agreements and if I can't agree to all the terms and  conditions (and that requires that I be able to read them) I will not accept them.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|Megadeth is an interesting band as they have accomplished a feat that not many others manage to accomplish: they have completely changed their philosophical (and, some may argue, theological) direction but managed to do that without reinventing their sound too dramatically. Often when a darker entertainer has a \\"come to Christ\\" moment in their life it heralds the doom of their sound, the death of the very thing that helped them climb to fame. \\"No smack, no soul\\", as the saying goes. Mustaine has managed to beat the spread, though, against all odds.   What can we say about Dave Mustaine? The man is still a wizard with a guitar, the sound still distinctly Mustaine. Play Megadeth on the radio and I still recognize it, immediately. How many modern bands can say that? Listening to the newer albums still brings me back to a childhood and this one is not different in that regard.   If you strongly dislike the new Mustaine, the clean Mustaine, and his views either political or theological then you can still listen to the music and enjoy it without heeding the words of the song. If you are the type that cannot abide the new direction then TH1RT3EN will not offer you respite from the previous albums focus and sound (End Game and the like). In the latter case this album is best avoided. Is it overproduced? A bit, but in the age of Auto Tune and \\"sampling\\" to complain about production at this point is like complaining that too many games use 3D - the old days are behind us. If the overproduction is a deal breaker then you will not hear a difference here. Again, best avoided.   If you like the sound, like the direction that End Game took you, then pick it up. You won't be disappointed.

B001UV4XI8|5.0|I like many out there wanted this movie for their collection, but did not think about buying it until after the digital download date had expired.  Well, I am happy to say that the digital download does work now!  I received the movie yesterday, and downloaded the movie on Itunes with no problem at all last night.  I recommend anybody who was not able to download the movie to try again with your code.  It may work now.  If you have not purchased this movie, the price is amazing for the quality of movie and the download included.  This is the time to buy.  Hope that helped all of you that were upset.
B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|Test devices:<br />Samsung Epic, Android 2.3 official<br />Viewsonic gTablet, FrankenTab (Android 2.2)<br /><br />First up, those of you that didn't alternate between pumping quarters into arcade machines and blowing into your game carts when they didn't work right will probably want to skip this.  For the rest of you, this app is easily the best way to bring back some old memories of when gaming was young.<br /><br />Atari's Greatest Hits comes with a single game, Missile Command.  However, you can do in app purchases for game 3 packs for $1, or get the whole collection for $10.  Games are broken down into roughly 17 arcade titles and 83 Atari 2600 titles.  So, if you buy the whole deal, that's ten cents per game.  Transactions for purchases are handled though Amazon, which takes away the worry of charges from unknown vendors.<br /><br />The visuals are very good, as is the sound.  Some may complain that the sound isn't reproduced exactly like the original, but one has to remember the speaker(s) in their device aren't exactly known for quality sound reproduction.  You're certainly not going to get the level of bass out of them that many of them that even a generic TV can do.<br /><br />The biggest worry I had was the control set.  In each game, the software offers up multiple control schemes.  Each scheme is set up so to make the game easy to play based on how you like to hold your device.  I tried out each set on both phone and tablet, and they worked well.  They worked even better when I changed the sensitivity setting that Atari thoughtfully put in.  Switching between the larger screened tablet and phone was a little difficult as I'd become used to where the virtual buttons were, but in no time I was able to adjust and play well.<br /><br />My gripes about this apps are very small, so small that I couldn't take off a star.  The biggest complaint is the UI doesn't keep the Back button in the same place.  Sometimes it's at the top, sometimes at the bottom.  I'd prefer it to be consistently in one place or the other.  The second rag is that while pausing a game is nice, so I can come back and continue to play it later, it would be nice to be able to exit back out to main menu and play another title instead of having to continue the play the original one.<br /><br />All in all, I love it, and spent the $10 to get all the games.he second rag is that while pausing a game is nice, so I can come back and continue to play it later, it would be nice to be able to exit back out to main menu and play another title instead of having to continue the play the original one.

B001UV4XJ2|5.0|The movie was an entertaining version of the book and easily held my attention all the way through; while it is somewhat dark and menacing it tells the story of Harry's final battle with Voldemort in an exciting fashion which will be enjoyable to watch repeatedly. The Epilogue, \\"Nineteen Years Later\\" is faithfully presented at the end of the movie as it is in the book. Both sound and picture are good and contribute to the telling of the story.<br /><br />I've now watched all three discs and downloaded the movie to my computer and it all worked just fine. The download is a formidable 2 GB's and takes a few minutes on a cable connection but it downloaded and played back.<br /><br />The download instructions tell you that Flixster and Adobe Air must be installed on your computer and automatically starts the process if those two programs aren't already on your computer. I didn't have either of them so I had to download and install them after which I downloaded the movie. The movie is now downloaded to my computer and plays back through the Flixster software; I've played the first few minutes and it seems to be going well.<br /><br />When I first tried the Blu-ray disc my player (OPPO BDP83-SE) froze and wouldn't do anything; I had to cut the power to the player then restarted the player, ejected the disc and then reinserted it at which time it played perfectly. I have no idea why it froze the first time and played perfectly the second time. Since then I've played the DVD version and replayed the Blu-ray version as well as the Special Features disc all with no problem.<br /><br />The movie is based on the book, not a movie version of the book; having said that I think the movie version has merit which can be enjoyed for what it is even though it varies from the book's version of the story. All of the key elements of the book's version are there but just packaged to get there by different routes. In her conversation with Daniel Radcliffe, J.K. Rowling makes some comments on the differences between her book version and the movie version; the movie's version of the story obviously had the author's apporval.<br /><br />The Special Features disc included some excellent resources including a conversation between Daniel Radcliffe and J.K.

I was really curious how it would work out with Flixster and the downloaded version of the movie. So far so good; I'll set aside some time to watch the entire movie on my computer and if anything noteworthy occurs I'll update this review. One thing I did notice was when I stopped the movie and later went back to it the movie started again at the beginning, not the point where I stopped it.<br /><br />On balance I think the movie is effective, powerful and even has some touching moments; those who appreciate the characters involved in the story will probably find the movie well worth their time.sion and the movie version; the movie's version of the story obviously had the author's apporval.

B004FOA84A|4.0|great app. the graphics was great. the story line was good. it was short though. hope there will be others to follow.
B004LUS390|5.0|Try this app, just because it's free, you will be amazed what your phone can really do... if I could only draw, it would be a daily thing for me. I will use this for quick scribble thoughts. Try typing yourself a message at a stoplight, when a few quick scribbles will be adequate. Many times after I get a free Amazon app, and I use it, I get some money to the programmer... because it's the right thing to do!

B002TVQ4HG|5.0|TRIANGLE is a story of regret, remorse, and second chances. Melissa George (TURISTAS) plays a woman on a sailing trip w/ friends who encounter a series of strange events, culminating in a murderous frenzy, repeated from various angles or points of view. Sound bizarre? It is! It's also quite riveting to watch it all unfold. If you've ever done something that you wish you could undo, fix, or erase completely, then TRIANGLE will hit a nerve...
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Since I've had this case on my phone, I've dropped it about 5 times in my driveway & there wasn't any damage to my phone! The case did it's job. I like the fact that it's tight around the phone but it's a bit tough to take off when you do your annual cleaning of front & back glass. I bought this along with [[ASIN:B003TPQBJW splash Masque Clear Screen Protector for iPhone 4 4G  4S AT&T and Verizon (3-Pack + 2 Bonus Back Films)]]. It's suggested to use a protector for the back of the phone because you will have a ring around the Apple logo. I'm very satisfied with this product & it's price. I will recommend to fellow iPhone users.
B005JZBP8W|5.0|Update. New 50th edition by Robert Harris is superb. Throw away the old Blu-ray, it's trash. Once again more loverly than ever!  I have been waiting for this for a long time. I too am surprised at the lack of a more Special Edition for the Blu-ray. I've had the super LaserDisc, and different DVD versions over the years.  I had to redo my review, as I've had a change of heart. I've been going back and forth between my old DVD and this Blu-ray. Something is amiss on the outer edges at times, and it seems more noticeable in darker scenes, but this is not always the case. It's almost as if there was vaseline on the sides of the lens. The scenes towards the end when Freddy takes Eliza back to &#34;where she belongs&#34; are very bad. There are many more scenes with issues such as this, some as bad, and some not as much.  Be sure to visit the hometheaterforum for the comment by Robert Harris about this. He was in charge of the original restoration back in 1994.  At times the picture looks beautiful, and will blow you away. You really can notice the extra detail. But other times, you feel, something's gotta be wrong.  It is possible that some of these defects were there, and just not as visible on DVD due to the lower resolution. But some just have to be a mistake.  Hopefully a fix will be coming in the very near future. Until such time, I think I must return this. I'm sure there will be a fire sale on these due to the problems.
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|Sounded Like fun, but a complete and utter failure to translate this game to a touch screen interface left me uninstalling after just seconds of play.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Fits the Kindle Fire well. The elastic straps hold the Kindle firmly in place. Cover is very light weight and well made. After moving cover back and forth a few times to loosen binding, the cover closes flat. Because of the material used, the cover stands in portrait and landscape easily on any surface without sliding. The interior pocket allows my hand to slip in and comfortably hold the Kindle for reading. I love the red color and artful script used in this cover. I am very happy with my purchase.
0066620996|5.0|When I was in college a friend and I learned to play some pretty serious competitive tennis without ever taking lessons. What we did was taped and studied all the top pros of the time - Chang, Aggasi, Lendl and Sampras and after taking notes over and over we narrowed our list of requirements for our \\"game\\" down to the similar things we found in these guys game. The theory was if all four of the top guys are doing it we need to do it. ... This book is a lot like that. It takes the best companies over a period of time and then looks at what each one did. The theory is that if a leading company is doing it - yours should too! Having been a student of this strategy before I can't help but be a believer in it now.

B002ZG99TA|5.0|This non-stop action film, from beginning to end, is based on true events about a runaway unmanned train. A series of human errors occur because of distractions and overconfidence and the lack of sufficient knowledge about how trains function. These are intensified by rivalries between older and younger generations and family problems. As a result a train is moving unmanned at 70-75 miles an hour, toward Trenton, Pennsylvania, filled with hazardous materials that will, unless stopped or at least slowed down, turn over when it reaches a turn at the town and, like a missile, destroy the town and kill people. The movie depicts the various attempts made to stop the train.
0316017930|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell at his best. I have read most all of Mr. Gladwell's books and I found this one to be the most intriguing to date. Yes the stories are handpicked but they are definitely thought provoking! No matter if you agree or disagree on the premise of the 10000 hour rule it's hard to not acknowledge that here is something there. Would some of the people discussed have been great without that rule? Maybe but they fit the rule so we will never know. ... I will say this it changed how I raise my kids. I always felt like a kid that made it at something - intelligence, sports or whatever - was just fulfilling their destiny... Now I feel like there is something to destinies being created...
B005HSG3VK|5.0|My cover arrived today.  I love the color and I love how light it is.  The Kindle Fire snapped right in and the cover stands when I want it to, and the cover lays flat when it is closed.  It is exactly as advertised and I think it is perfect.  I learned that the price was lowered from the time I placed my pre-order and when I read all the negative reviews, I was worried that I had made a bad decision and might be returning the case.  I disagree with the negative reviews and this cover is what I wanted and expected to receive.
082300659X|5.0|I ordered this book as soon as I heard it was going to be published and it was well worth the wait. This is a must for any serious art student. It is well illustrated, well written and comprehensive. It is worth far more than the price being asked. Brava, Julia Aristides, BRAVA!
B004LUS390|5.0|Wow. I was blown away by this app. I got it because it was free and looked pretty interesting. Started doodling just to try it out and next thing I know an hour has gone by and I am immersed in an intricate drawing of a turtle.<br />With so many tools and features, it's hard not to get wrapped up in this app if you are at all artistically inclined. I have not drawn since I was young (like elementary school) but within minutes of opening this app I was nostalgically reliving my past and was overcome with that beautiful tranquility you get when you are creating something.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|First of all, at this time it was free.  Having said that, I would pay for the app later if they came out with a Pay version.  I am very visual and it immediately showed all the WiFi connections in my block.  It has several screens that show the information in graphic format and one screen that shows the strength in a full screen \\"Vu Meter\\".  This helps with the Kindle finding a sweet spot in the house.  I am using it on a new Kindle \\"Fire\\" and it does not appear to have any problems at all.  Another real nice feature is that it shows on one of the color screens the channel you, and others are on.  This helps as I was able to move to the \\"high end\\" on my router while most of the others in my area were clustered around the low area.  Once again ... very nice, visual, application for use with my new Kindle Fire.  Thank you

0446573019|4.0|What I like the most about David Baldacci's writing is that he always starts his stories out with engaging and engrossing action!  And in his latest Zero Day, he doesn't let us down. John Puller is as strong and solid a character as Baldacci's written in a long time. I've been a Baldacci fan since I first read Absolute Power.  I like Baldacci's writing style. I like the way he puts words together without a lot of fluff.  It's at the beginning of the second chapter when he gives us what we need to know about lead character John Puller.   \\"National Security.  That was why John Puller was here.\\"  Not long after Puller arrives in the coal mining community,  there's a couple of murders and  Puller wonders why he's alone in this. Or is he?  Government secrets, betrayals, and a tightly woven plot all go to make this another winner for Baldacci.  I thought the addition of Sam (Samantha) Cole, who he partners with on a local level, is a great addition to the story, Sam's well developed and smartly written, the character works well within the story arc.   I've read the comparison's to Lee Child's Jack Reacher character and I don't see too many similarities. And I'm a fan of Reacher's too. Yes, he's a lone ranger, ex military investigator. But to me, that's where the comparisons end.   I say: read it and enjoy it for what it is, a tightly drawn suspense novel.    I give it 3 1/2 stars out of 5.  This ARE was provided to me by the publisher, and that in no way affected my review.
0553807919|5.0|I can't say enough about how helpful this book is to me as a parent.  If I could only have two books on parenting, I'd pick this along with Playful Parenting.  The book uses brain research to show how to handle tough situations and, more importantly, how to nurture your child, yet the brain research is written in a very accessible and understandable way.  Each chapter has a summary, and the book has a chart at the end that has the highlights and is broken down by age.  My 4 year old is passionate to say the least, and the book helped me understand that when a child is in an emotional (or right brain) state, left brain logic (talking, lecturing, do this/stop this now or you won't get that) has no effect.  The child can't begin to process logic until calm and back from the fit.  The book also suggests what to do instead.  Emotions can be pretty overwhelming for kids, too, so I appreciated the suggestions and drawings for teaching your child about how the brain and emotional states work.  The book says right off that it isn't intended as a model or system for parenting but as a way to understand your child better.  I tried to read Siegel's first book Parenting from the Inside Out, but I couldn't follow it.  This book is far more accessible.

B0053Q9DHW|5.0|Wonderful service! I am thankful that you had it available for a reasonable price. It arrived on time and I watched it immediately.
1451648537|5.0|Awesome book. Steve can teach us a lot. Both what we should do and what we shouldn't. We can try to be like him in some cases and not to be like him in others.  Congrats to the author
B004GJDQT8|1.0|I had been using this app successfully for some time now, just updated and the new version is a failure, when i go to search it jumps too quickly to the manual type in page totally bypassing the 'scan a barcode' option, tapping furiously sometimes allows me to scan a barcode but the ease of use i had been used to is a thing of the past, it is not fit for purpose, someone fix this please...
1573225517|4.0|I wish I could elaborate on this book more, but suffice it to say that it was a very good novel worth reading, although I tend to gravitate towards other Hornby novels, such as A Long Way Down and Juliet, Naked.  Still, it was a fantastic read, and from what I understand is usually considered his best novel, other than maybe About a Boy.  There's just nothing I have but the utmost respect for Hornby as a writer.  He paints the scenes well, and he uses varying themes throughout all his books.  I guess almost anyone can relate to this book, as it involves relationships and those that hurt the most.  It is about love, and loss, and then love again.  I've seen the movie once a long time ago, and while reading the book, I imagined Jack Black and John Cusack as the two major characters.  I'd say the book was better, because movies cut out so much that I almost wish that so many books weren't becoming movies.  Definitely worth at least one read, as it is the perfect escape from whatever life is currently throwing at you.  Great writing style, keeps your attention through the whole book.  A must read for music lovers, as there are so many music references that you can tell that Hornby is a music buff.  Some day I hope to write a novel this good, but the odds of that are a million to one.
031606792X|5.0|Okay I discovered the twilight Saga because of my sister. She was always talking to me about it. So I decided to borrow my neighbors book and start reading it and I was instantly hook. I've read the twilight Saga at least three times. But the last book has to be favorite. Because of Renesmee. I love the almos fight scenes, it keeps you wondering to the very end, well are they or aren't they going to duke it out. Nope they are not going to fight. But I love how their are two almost fights that never ever take happen, that do add more humor to the book. I love how Jacob finally finds the love of his life. Edward and Bella finally get there forever....Hybrid children are introduced and everyone who reads this books gets to meet some more vampires. This book has perfect suspense, romance, and intrigue and keeps you wondering till the very end. I love this book, it is my favorite of twilight series. I just hope the movie sticks to the book as much as possible. it would be a shame if they didn't. The twilight is amazing. Its a love story with a much anticipated happy ending.
1451648537|4.0|Isaacson provides a truly interesting read, by leveraging his access to Steve Jobs and his circle he is able to provide a great many insights into one of recent business' most successful CEOs, but arguably less successful human beings. Steve Jobs does not come across as a great person, but rather as a delusion, hyper opinionated, rude, arrogant, selfish jerk (and that's just in regards to deciding on furniture). He seemed to get bogged down in what would appear to most people as easy decisions, such as what type of sofa, or washing machine do I need? Conversely he then seemed to able to make multi-million dollar decisions on the fly and cut through to the heart of amazing products with great clarity. Fortunately for him and Apple's customers he was able to deliver many home run products and grow Apple to be one of the most successful companies in history.   The book flows well, but I definitely found the earlier chapters on Jobs and Apple to be more complete than the latter ones, which have a bit of a rushed and incomplete feeling to them. The book though is definitely a must-read and while it will answer many questions about Steve Job, just as many are left unanswered. Personally I could never have worked for the type of boss he was, but many did, and produced wonderful products.  The book is a hefty tome, but does not drag, and as mentioned the reader is often left feeling that many issues could have have been discussed further. In reality would a thousand pages have provided greater clarity on Steve Jobs? The answer would have to be no, he was a strange, amazing, frustrating man, who defies (for better or worse) easy description, but Isaacson does come close and it is debatable if another book would ever get closer.
B0000AUHPB|4.0|The entertainment value is, on the whole, moderately good. But the punchline at the end is brilliantly funny! You are left to make up your own ending: did they get the gold or not? Did they get out of the bus safely?
0920668372|5.0|This was a gift for a friend's baby shower, and when my friend unwrapped the package, she almost cried. This brought back some of her childhood memories of her mom reading this to her. It's such a sweet story about a mother's love. It's a perfect book for a child's library.
B003Y5H574|5.0|This movie is both funny and romantic, heartwarming and surprising. Bitter and sweet. Lovely and at times not so lovely. Its just like life. This movie should be an inspiration to us all that there is a such thing as love and soul mates and true love and people can change. This movie absolutely blew me away, there were times where I teared up, and times where I was surprised and times where I was like \\"Yes!\\"   However the ending could have been slightly more better. But at the same time the ending was kind of a cliff hanger. I loved this movie. I am so happy I made the decision to buy this movie without ever seeing it. Its definitely worth going in anyones collection.
0374532990|5.0|Reading about the High Line phenomenon and knowing the enormity of getting anything done in nyc,one is struck by the humble origen of this project- two young men meeting at a community meeting, their exchange of business cards, and subsequent discovery of an inner-city wilderness. But as the story unfolds (especially as it is told in this remarkable double narrative form) there is little doubt the vision and tenacity of Hammond and David was anything but extraordinary. An inspiring and uplifting story of an idea that bore great fruit.
B005NS0VNU|5.0|I agree with most, that some notable exceptions to this fantastic list, but overall, it encompasses how R.E.M. has changed and yet stayed true to their own selves.  Definitely recommend.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I bought this solely because of the digital copy. I like the physical discs but it's nice to have the digital copy. If I had known that I would have to create 2 different accounts just to attempt downloading the dvd, I would not have bought this. What happened to the regular digital copies that you could simply enter the disc into your computer or enter an activation code into itunes? This sucks!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I love the ability to be about to edit and create docs on the go. this has made my life a lot easier. program is easy to use too.
0395389496|5.0|I love this book, I love the movie-I just love the Polar Express! This edition of the book is so nice. The ornament that came with it isn't anything to brag about but the cover and book are nicely made and this Christmas story is a classic-my whole family loves it!
B002BWP49M|5.0|Just saw this on opening night. The acting was noticeably better in this installment and it really drew me in. The movie had a lot of emotional moments such as Bella's wedding (dress was great), Bella's inner thoughts and feelings for Edward, Jacob imprinting on Renesmee (a beautiful baby), the birth scene.... It goes on and on. There was also some unexpected comedy at the wedding that made for a nice balance. The movie dramatized the wolves moreso than the book, but it didn't detract from the story. I'm a married ICU nurse and this was a fantastic 2 hour escape that I can't wait to repeat. Highly recommend.   For those wondering about Jake and Edward, they were both excellent eye candy this go-around. Bella looked beautiful too in the beginning - I can't wait to see how she turns out as a vampire (that's where the movie stops). Go see it!
B0055Q5F36|1.0|This product didn't fit my devices...  Don't make the mistake I made and purchase hoping it will work.  Even though I was told by a sales rep it will work IT DOESN'T WORK!
B001UV4XJ2|2.0|I have nothing to say about the movie. It is known masterpiece. So is the blu ray. However, that 'ultraviolet' digital copy is CRAP. I am saying this after trying everything. Digital copies previously given were so simple and easy to download and manage, but this one is a nightmare even for a cyber savvy guy. Here is my experience in detail for others to read. Hope it may save you some time.  1. Unless you type in the 'flixster' right, the webpage wont open. The spelling is FLIXSTER, not FLIXTER (the mistake many have inadvaertantly made)   2. Once you get on there, it will ask you to create TWO seperate accounts a) Flixster and b) Ultraviolet (my question is WHAT FOR? Why isn't the code sufficient?)  3. They will ask you to agree their terms and conditions so many times, you wont have any patience to read all of them, as you will be eager to see the movie. I don't know how to interpret it in terms of your protection legally.  4. After creating TWO seperate accounts, they will give you a box to type your code (you think 'finally!'? keep reading..), after that, you will go on another page to see options (stream now, dwnld to your pc, etc).  5. Even after this, they will ask you to install TWO applications (Flixster collections and Adobe Air, which, in turn is required for flixster collections to function normally....why can't flixster work by itself?).When you INSTALL the applications, MAKE SURE YOU REMOVE THE TICKS in front of the boxes that have some crappy services (flixster would like to send you some stupid notifications..etc..). Otherwise your inbox is surely gonna overflow!!!  6. N O W you did it! Congratulations! Click on the movie download page and be patient to wait further. You never know how long it will take for the movie to dwnld. I have a 12 Mbps download speed and it took me almost 30 min to complete this 2 GB movie (I have an HDTV connected to the same network and streaming HD movies has never been a problem to me). They cannot blame that the serverwas overwhelmed. I am downloading one week past its release!  7. THE CLIMAX: I played the movie (using flixster collections, NOT RealOne or iTunes). It plays well. However, when I look for the file in pc, I cannot find it! Then I Googled and found that they have an option in the 'flixster collections\\". Follow this path- Collection > Add > select My Computer as location > Select directory > Check on box \\"add to iTunes library\\". Now it should show there, right? NOPE!  I have tried everything- Try loace the file, add it to multiple folders, multiple loactions, try adding it to iTunes through flixter collections (which kept failing all the time), Add the file/folder through iTunes menu. NOTHING WORKS.  Okay, the last option was to try playing it in RealOne/any other media player and then convert it to iPhone compatible files (which I did for hundreds of videos). THE FILE JUST WON'T PLAY IN ANY MEDIA PLAYER!!! WHAT RUBBISH? I see the 2 GB file sitting in 'video' folder (The file name is \\"ADS_UV_HarryPotter7P2_main_FAXS_2000k_dl\\"), but I CANNOT PLAY IT IN ANYTHING BUT Flixster collections! FORGET ADDING IT TO iTunes!  In total, I spent 3 relentless hrs to get to my digital copy only to get frustrated. I didn't get this frustrated even while installing any software or recovering my pc. This is not just crap but a huge scam to promote flixster collections (I never heard of that media player before, though I have flixster app on iPnone). It is still OK to promote new things, but not at this cost. They are luring us by saying that you can stream anytime anywhere, but they don't deliver the simplest and the most basic stuff. Plus, when we have an option of renting an HD movie straight from Amazon and other internet video services, who wants to see this crap on their Google TV? FLixster and Warner, FIRST MAKE IT PLAY ON MY iTunes and then make promises.  It is clear that this has been a huge deal for Warner Home Video, who have cashed every single dime from Harry Potter series(which is fine for me), but this is nonsense and torture for the fans.  So, go for it if you are ready to spend enough time only to see a downloaded copy of the movie. Forget about adding it to your iPod. I wrote all this only to let others know what is in store for them. BOO the ultraviolet copy. If you think all these efforts are worth for downloading ONE digital copy, you are welcome to the show!  Also, if anyone finds a way to nail it, please let me know. I will be happy to correct my mistakes (if there are any). Good luck and thanks for reading.

B005HSG3TC|5.0|After reading the reviews I was dreading receiving this cover. I opened up the package and was surprised. It's really not that bad! It fits the fire perfectly, the elastic strap seems sturdy, and the \\"stand\\" works just fine. A great deal for the money actually.
1451627289|5.0|Those are the opening words to Stephen King's 11/22/63.  A description of the main character Jake Epping, and rather accurate one of myself too.  But I'll tell you what, I was a crying man by the end of this book.  I'm not going to give away too much or write a long winded review...but listen to what most of the people are saying.  This is one of, possibly THE best, King stories you'll read.
B00386EZJU|5.0|I listened to this soundtrack over and over when I first bought it, and not once did it get boring.  There was always something new to find and listen for. My personal favorites were Forbidden Friendship and Romantic Flight, because they just seemed to paint a portrait of the characters in a way that just flowed.  This soundtrack is definitely worth buying, and will never fail to take your breath away.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Its not the movie that I am reviewing, but it good, its the packaging of the new UV through flixster; don't waste your money on this digitial download. I have done digital downloads before through Amazon, which was fast easy to download and no other accounts had to be opened, unlike the present one, which make you sign up for flixster account, then when you try to download there is error after error, and then when I finally got it worked out on another computer I had it downloading to the computer for over 4 hours with only 33% done by the time I have to go home and turn off the computer. PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS DOWNLOAD VERSION
B005O30Y5Y|1.0|WB has made something so simple, loading a digital copy into iTunes, impossible.<br /><br />To use this digital copy, you have to install WB's own buggy app on your device.  This is a ripoff, don't waste your time or money to get any digital copies from WB studios!
B000Q04XDY|5.0|Excellent book. A must read for everyone, even terrorists.  If you don't read this book then you proably don't know the danger we're in.  If you don't know who the enemy is then by the time you do it will be too late.  Amazon.com delivered as always.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games trilogy is one of the most engaging book series there has to exist. Its brutal, its heart-wrenching, its emotional, its, basically, everything good, great and beyond.   Since page 1, you can be sure to be totally immersed in it. Im an avid reader, but I hadnt ever read a book that had me sitting on the edge of my chair since the very first page, like this book had me.   Suzzanne Collins`s writing is just out of this world, and her dialogue is addictively good. The plot is just facinating, and the storyline is so well told and greatly developed that you have a constant hunger for more throughout the whole book.   The characters are everything you could hope for. Katniss is such a marvelous and deep character; there are so many layers to her, and she will uncover them with every chapter, revealing who she really is.   And maybe, according to dignity and honor in our world, we shouldnt like the character, but the truth is, you will fall in love with her. In a way, she is such a guilty pleasure.   Peets is honorable, kind, everything we should be; but we arent. He doesnt want to kill, he would go to the point of losing his own life in order to avoid it, because he cant go through with it. He negotiates. He talks, manipulates, and forms alliances. But he does so with dignity, and honor. He is a very good person, and a character that you will love from the very beggining.   Gale, on the other side, is very different from Peeta. Whereas Peeta is something sweet, Gale is fire, passion. He is such an interesting character, with a huge depth. We dont get to know him much in this book, but on the next ones he grows to be much more than Katniss`s friend or \\"cousin\\". You will really like him in this book though, at least I did. You can identify with him.  I cant express really, how much I love these books. The Hunger Games is one of my two favorite series in the world (the other one is Vampire Academy), and I have already read it more than 3 times.   There is somuch to say about these books, its just a shame this review is so short, but, well, I feel I summarized well what I felt about them.   I cant say enough flattery about these books because they are just so simply magnificent and fantastic.   Trust me, you should buy them, read them, and read them again and another time after that.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Ordered the headset in July and recieved them within 2 weeks in Australia.The sound quality is superb when they are working.True surround sound when used with my Xbox, Bluray player and PS3 and has on more than one occassion made me jump when something jumps onto the screen. Best sound quality and reproduction I have had so far with any of my headsets. Unfortunately about 2 weeks ago the transmitter stopped connecting to any device I hooked onto it as it wouldn't find the Dolby source. I was told it the Dolby chip had a fault and they should be replaced. I contacted the service centre here in Australia and was told due to buying them from Amazon they wouldn't replace them as I have to go back to my place of retail. I bought them from Amazon as they sell here for $250 and I can get them from Amazon for less than $160 delivered to my door. Same product here in Australia as the one I recieved from Amazon but it has opened up a world of pain. I gave them 2 stars due to fact that the sound is great but if the quality of the product was great I would not have to replace them and when you do it should be a lot easier than what it is. Unfortunately this will be my last Turtle Beach purchase as I think as an Australian we are getting ripped off with the price and the after market experience is quite poor to say the least.  I contacted Amazon and was told to send them back, at their expense, and was sent another pair and had them in my hot little hands within 2 weeks in Australia.The follow up service by Amazon was excellent, unlike the manufacturers response, and would definately advise anyone not to be doughtful about buying from Amazon due to their customer focus.  Recently bought another 2 pair of these headsets for my Nephews and we all have been very happy with my purchase. Have now changed my rating to 5 stars due to how I was treated by Amazon and by the quality of the sound that is reproduced by the headphones.
B0050DZN4K|2.0|I just LOVE feedly - it's an awesome web app, but this is buggy. It looks great on the fire but needs a fix for google reader (just not showing the login dialog box). Please update! This is a real miss for one of the apps that ships out of the box with the fire. :-(
B005LJITS0|5.0|After reading so many depressing reviews, I had to add my two cents. I personally enjoyed this movie very much.<br /><br />This story was given an upgrade from comic book to a mature, interesting, and exciting movie. I enjoyed this movie more than Superman Returns.  Check it out.
B003H9MSPG|3.0|First off, this gun is HUGE! I really did not expect it to be as long as it is! And it looks really cool; its one of my coolest looking Nerf guns! But it doesn't shoot well AT ALL. I have to admit, when you take off the front part, it shoots farther, but still it only shoots about 12 feet. My $6 night striker shoots longer then that! Overall, I am very disappointed. If it wasn't for the fact that it looks amazing, I would give it 1 star.
B005POK858|1.0|Immediately. Crashes my Droid x2 this needs to be foxed before i recommend to anyone .  Can't believe this Is a paid app
B001UV4XIS|1.0|While the movie itself is great, the ultraviolet digital copy is completely worthless.  You can't download it to your tablet to take on a plane, you have to be connected to WiFi and stream it.  Not only that but I jumped through all the hoops to get the copy to stream on my Android Tablet, install the app, create a flixster account, create an ultraviolet account, enter the code, etc .... and after all of that it fails to stream on my tablet, worthless.  If you are buying this movie in hopes of a real digital copy then don't buy this, it's not worth it.

B005DOL0R0|4.0|Does the Kindle Fire Zip Sleeve smell?  Yes.  Mine arrived today, and as other reviewers have shrieked to the blackened skies of woe, there's a light-to-medium plastichemical odor.<br /><br />Dealbreaker?  Perhaps for some.  Maybe my sense of smell has dulled a smidge over the years, but there's no way the sleeve's emanations will permeate a household, car, bus, bedroom, insert-enclosed-space here.  After removing mine from the packaging, I parked it on my front porch in the fresh air for a couple of hours, and the scent is mostly diminished.  I'm fairly confident the remaining odor will dissipate over time, but if it doesn't, I'm reasonably sure it's not going to induce mid-40s limb deformities.  If you're overly sensitive to these types of odors, you'll probably want to save yourself the hassle and find something constructed from different materials.<br /><br />Yes, it's expensive.  I knew that when I bought it.  I certainly wouldn't condemn the sleeve to an asinine 1-star review based on its price. You *were* there when you clicked \\"Place Your Order\\", right?  If the current release-time price is a dealbreaker, the solution is quite simple.  Wait for the price to drop, or buy something else.  Empowered purchasing, no?<br /><br />The Zip Sleeve is reasonably well-constructed and forms a nice snug fit around the Kindle Fire.  The interior, as other reviewers have noted, is sufficient for protecting and cushioning the tablet.  The zipper enclosure is solid.  The color scheme is appealing, and the Amazon branding isn't obtrusive.  I've had bad and good tablet and smartphone cases, and the Zip Sleeve falls in the upper 20% as far as form factor, usability, and construction go.  I'll rate it here the same:  4/5.
B005KMX866|5.0|I have been a fan of Chris Isaak since 2000 and he did a great job at covering Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Johnny Cash well on this album. I recommend this album for anyone who is a fan of Chris Isaak.
B005D9B26E|2.0|I bought both the Aqualung and Quadrophenia deluxe boxes and the Tull box is roughly the same price as the Quadrophenia box and I don't feel ripped-out at all with the Tull box, despite it only being a single LP with many different mixes and demos. The ENTIRE Aqualung LP is mixed in 5.1 on a Blu-ray disc and the sound is fantastic. It's a top-notch product that I don't mind spending so much money on.  The Quadrophenia box is a half-finished product, at best. For the same price as the Tull box, Quadrophenia is just lacking. Quadrophenia is a complete work of art and having only selected tracks in 5.1 seems so lazy. I want to hear Quadrophenia as a complete concept CD in 5.1, not what this box set offers.  (Additional info:  I'm a big Who fan from way back and I saw them perform live several times with the original line-up of Moon, Daltry, Entwistle, and Townshend. I've bought all their LPs, cassettes, CDs over the years in many different remastered forms. I am not a big fan of Jethro Tull, but appreciate a lot of their music.)  The Quadrophenia box set turned out to be a big disappointment.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|I am disappointed that this is missing. Otherwise it's fine. It's nice to play on a larger screen. Bring us the pomegranate!
B005CGI4EG|3.0|First I have to say the set is a great idea, the package is fine albeit a little different. I really want to give it 5 stars, however, I couldn't and here is why.  I really believe this version is not an authorized, legal copy. I looked at the content and size of the the disk in the set and compared them to a season one set that was purchased separately. I discovered the complete set DVD were not the same size as the season one disk, however they look the same, say the same and have the same menu options they even play the same videos and extras.   Anyone who know about DVD/Movies will know that a standard DVD-R hold is only 4 gb. a Double layer disk holds 8gb. The Season set disks average size was 6-7 gb (DL disk) this complete series disks, same season and disk are only 4gb. There are programs that will take a standard DVD-DL (that 99% of the production DVDs today) and shrink it to fit on one single layer disk. This appears to be the case aleast in the set I received Direct from Amazon, (Fulfillment by Amazon). Was less the $40 so still debating on returning them. Wondering if anyone else has discovered this too or did i just get a bad set.

0061703087|4.0|Give Michael Crichton his due.  He was one of the sharpest observers of contemporary life, and he was fascinated by new techonology.  He was often the first to write about cutting-edge subjects.    And the first half of this novel is excellent in its portrayal of a man whose marriage is falling apart.  His devotion to his children and his love for his wife/fear of losing her are poignantly depicted.  The ending does get a little predictable, and he should have come back to that initial intimate portrayal of a family in trouble and woven it into the plot at the end, but Crichton was a unique story-teller, and I always find something to admire in his books.
B0053VKP8S|4.0|Great device! I bought a new wireless DVD player so I could hook Netflix up to my TV. My surround sound system is old and did not have the digital in-put jack. If it were not for this device I would have been stuck with putting out a few hundred, or more, for a new sound system.   Sometimes I do have to reset it by disconnecting the power, but other than that I am completely satisfied. Make sure you have another outlet; it does have to be plugged in.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Bag is made of quality materials, appears smaller than I thought, but that's not a big deal, fits everything and is comfortable to wear. This bag is IDENTICAL to the canon bag except it does not have the canon logo. I appericiate this because people are not drawn to the fact that my backpack has a big 'steal me CANON' sign on it.  Overall this is a great bag for the price and has a million little pockets and zippers for a bunch of accessories

B004W7GPXI|5.0|Daniel Barenboim's recording of Parsifal, Wagner's last opera was released in 1991. I thought I had reviewed this recording five years ago when I first bought it. I even remembered some phrases from that imagined review, and on finding that I never wrote them down, I've listened to the whole opera again.  On the whole, this Parsifal stands among the best studio recordings available, chiefly on the strength of Barenboim's leadership of the Berlin Philharmonic. His tempi tend toward the slow end of the Parsifal spectrum, but not as slow by far as Goodall or Levine. There is a great deal of orchestral detail brought out for coloristic and emotional effect. But most importantly, this is a performance wrought with a deep understanding of the spiritual basis of the story and the music, and that, my friends, is the single most important quality a Parsifal performance must have. It is also the most difficult quality to convey and all too often lacking, especially in studio recordings.  The singing ranges from very good to great. Leading the pack is José van Dam's Amfortas. Eleven years after his recording with von Karajan, there is naturally some bloom off the voice, but it is still marvelously rich and steady. The darker, grainier sound, like old polished walnut, ideally conveys Amfortas's suffering as the mediæval Man of Sorrows. This is not the writhing agony of Thomas Stewart or profound rage of George London, but a deep spiritual sadness and longing for release.  Siegfried Jerusalem was just past his peak at the time of this recording. Never a true heldentenor, he occasionally pushes to the very limit of his instrument's abilities, but never beyond or for more than a moment. He is ideally suited to Parsifal's youthful side, and manages the heroic parts of the second and third acts sufficiently well. However, he is a musician of the first rank, and possessor of a very keen intellect, which comes through in the clarity of his phrasing and the enunciation of the text. This is one of his most satisfying performances on record.  Waltraud Meier had been the leading exponent of the role of Kundry for some twenty years, and has been a very fine Kundry indeed. Unfortunately, we've been through a very dry patch of Wagner singers in that time, and coupled with the simple fact that few mezzos (or sopranos, as Wagner scored the part) are able or willing to rise to the role's many demands. Time was, way back, when sopranos like Marjorie Lawrence and Maria Callas actually SANG, in lady-like fashion, Kundry's many screams, shrieks, and moans. No stage director or audience would tolerate that today. Meier, however, gets down deep into the part. She is better seen live than merely heard, though; her great beauty and acting ability are mesmerizing. This is the best of her several recorded performances: The 1985 Levine/Bayreuth, her first, finds her a bit tentative and hamstrung by the conductor's lethargic tempi. In the live Vienna 2005 performance, her voice sounds worn and edgy. There is a here a hooded tone to much of her sing that gives it a poignant, plaintive quality. She also sings hauntingly the disembodied alto solo at the end of Act One.  Matthias Hölle has been called in other reviews the weakest link in the cast, but on repeated listening I find much that is admirable. He certainly lacks the broader color-pallette of Kurt Moll, or the sheer transport of Hans Hotter's best live performances. Yet there is here a fine sense of detail, and a great understanding of character and his situation. This is more in line with Robert Lloyd's modest and compassionate approach to the part. I think, though, that he is hampered most by Teldec's engineers. More about that in a moment.  Filling out the cast are John Tomlinson's excellent Titurel, suitably cavernous and distant sounding. Cornelius Hauptmann as the 2nd Knight makes the most of his few but crucial lines in Act One, scene 1; and the Flowermaidens are lead by the excellent Edith Wiens and include Pamela Coburn and Sally Burgess. Only Günther von Kannen disappoints as Klingsor. Not that he's bad, he's just not bad enough, as a character, I mean. He just sings the part handsomely, without conveying anything much of anything wicked, or nasty, or...well, I've heard worse. The chorus of the Deutschen Staatsoper Berlin, particularly the men, sing the Gail Temple scenes extraordinarily well.  My one persistent complaint about this recording is the sound engineering. The sound is actually very good, but recorded mostly at too low a volume level. The Teldec crew seem to have gone for a natural stage/pit theater balance, but ramp up the gain only in the extended orchestral passages. The quiet parts, most of the opera in fact, need to be played with the volume up a good deal higher than usual. If you live in an apartment or listen with headphones you will be scrambling to turn it down once in a while. If you live in a house and can listen at a goodly, full voiced level, this is a gorgeous experience.
B002BWP49C|5.0|i went to the premier last night and its one of the best ive seen yet. They went on a bit too much with the wolves and cut things that could have been fit in if it hadnt been for that but all in all it was a great movie going experience. i hope the dvd has lots of deleted scenes because you can tell they tried to cut things to fit the younger audience. that kinda sucked.
0385738773|5.0|The Maze Runner & The Scorch Trials were amazing but this one was the best! It's my favorite series and The Death Cure is my favorite book!
B005HSG3VK|1.0|I paid $39.99 for this 99 cents worth of flimsy plastic box, and Amazon has decided now (possibly after seeing some of these reviews?) to drop the price to $29.99.  Hey guess what?  It's still overpriced by about twenty-nine dollars.<br /><br />Some folks are \\"surprised\\" at the negative reviews?  Geeze.  If I'd paid a buck for this I suppose I'd figure I'd gotten my money's worth.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Great Movie, but what a chore to use the UltraViolet streaming site. Every movie I've bought had a real digital copy which could easily be downloaded to itunes. This UltraVIolet stuff is worthless. Get the UK version region free with the real digital copy.

1932100660|5.0|I believe that anyone interested in true health should read this book.  You will never think the same way about diet again.  If you follow the principles in this book you should have a much greater quality of life.  Very eye-opening!
0606147195|2.0|I did not understand what \\"turtleback school and library binding\\" meant so I was not happy with how this book was bound and returned it.
B004A8ZX2I|5.0|There is a tendency for people to compare this movie to taken, as Liam Neeson's characters have similarities, but this movie is more complex and is surrounded by more mystery and intrigue, and a bit less action. Liam Neeson does his usual excellent job, as does Frank Langella, but I have to give real kudos to Swiss-born Bruno Ganz, who plays his character to perfection.  Just when you think you know how it will turn out.<br /><br />The blue ray disc reproduces this movie well and I found no problems with it.

1451627289|5.0|1) I can't remember reading more than 3 or 4 King books my whole life.  I am not into the scary stuff, so I pass on most of Mr. King's work.  I ordered this because it is historical fiction and I thought I would give it a read.  Wow!  The work that went into the research and writing of this book deserves respect.  Great characters, great hook, nice twists throughout.  2) The Hook - Time travel is always interesting.  When you add righting wrongs and helping people it makes sense and seems like a positive thing.  The first trip backwards to 1958 was spot on and the way I would have seen things.  After going back and forth, a sense of calm settles into the book.  With the calm comes the questions, what would you do for several years waiting for your big moment?  Nice job getting me into the book and settling me down.  3) 1958-1963 - The Character development here was great.  After righting a few wrongs, what would you do for several years?  I thought the teaching school portion was right on as that is what Jake would naturally gravitate towards.  I also liked that Jake didn't go wild with the gambling.  That has alway lent a false note to other books I have read.  You just have to live life for awhile.  The book settled down to almost a monotonous pace during this time.  I bit here, a detail there, some good times, and some really bad times.  4) 1963 - The attack on Sadie, the recovery, the attack on Jake, the partial recovery.  These events added drama and made my heart start to beat.  Each of these events could have caused Jake to miss the big event.  Mr. King did a tremendous job with pacing here...gradually starting to ramp things up and narrowing the focus.  5) The Big Day - One of the best short stories I have read.  I read it twice to make sure that I got all the juice out of that literary orange.  6) The Double Twist Ending - This is where I felt that the money I paid for the book was worth it.  I wanted to see what would happen to Jake once he got back.  Thetwist about the changed world Jake would return to was interesting and very visual.  The return to \\"complete the circle\\" was very difficult and appreciated.  The soft ending after that was a welcome close.  7)  This week I was on vacation and I read a Baldacci, a Grisham and this.  Stephen King mopped the floor with both of them.  His name says it all...he is the King.
B002JIOO7G|3.0|The remastered version of the Esoteric is excellent, both in recording and in the liner notes. The disc itself is not the Camel's best. There are other works of much higher band as \\"Harbours Of Tears\\", \\"The Snow Goose\\" and \\"Mirage\\" and the first album of the band \\"Camel\\".
B0066KVTKS|3.0|Season 7 is a mix. Some of the episodes have been great. But the show is losing direction. It seems like it is winding down. The of the most important characters -- Bobby and Cass -- have been missing from the last few episodes. Also, some of the production elements that made the show unique -- the rock and roll track, Dean's car and the dark filming -- have been dropped. Now the show is filmed in bright colors, and Dean is driving a baby blue car. This has changed the entire texture of the show. The show also seems empty without Bobby. I'm not sure why they keep bringing back Crawley. If anything, Cass should return.
B002JIOO76|4.0|A very good edition of this great record. It pays to trade for this if you already have the CD and enjoy the band. The repertoire is pleasant and the remastering of Esoteric was excellent.
B00127RAJY|5.0|(This is my husband's account, but the review is from me). I used this video after each of my children were born. I am typically lean and in good enough shape. I lost 20 pounds to get to my pre-pregnancy weight in 3 weeks. I did only eat approximately 1000 calories each day, as well. I know, not the best method, but I needed fast result. What I did not expect was how my toned I became. I looked the best I have ever looked in my life after doing this video. Now, I needed fast results, so I did this video 5 days per week for 1 month. I also did the video 3-4 times in a row. (about 1-1.5 hours). I would do each circuit, each day, in a row. I got incredible muscle definition. Now, 2 years later, I started the video again after my twins were born and I needed to lose 15 pounds. I did that with this video in about 2 months and ate about 1500 calories/day. Also, I only did the video 3x/week and only 1 time on those days. My body looks lean and tight, but not nearly as toned. But, I'm still really happy with the results. This video is amazing and you get out of it what you put into it. I never get bored with it. I also rotate circuits each time I work out and I still get a burn after all this time. I actually just bought this dvd for the second time since my 2 year old used the first one as a chew toy. :)
0812550706|5.0|Enders Game was recommended to me by a friend of mine.  I loved it from the first chapter. Not only is the story a great idea but the writing is WAY better a lot teen novels. Y'know those novels that have a great story but the book is ruined by the main characters \\"Eternally burning love\\" for some girl?  Enders Game is not that kind of book. I won't say what the story is about cause I don't want to spoil it but I will say that you have got to read this book! I would read it again if I didn't want to read the sequel so bad.
1400032717|1.0|I found this novel hard to believe.  In fact, I found it to be one of the worst novels that I have ever tried to read.  And being autistic myself, I might as well explain why in a review.  For instance, if you're autistic and have to be in a special school for such people, chances are you've never been in a place like a train station on your own.  So why does it make sense for Christopher to manage get on a train all by himself and manage to navigate the chaotic environment of a train station the very first time he was in one alone?  That is a huge discrepancy between the novel and real life--and I found that it made no sense whatsoever.  In addition, I simply cannot envision someone who wants to do nothing but talk about astronomy and math and similar sciences writing such a story.  When you have a genuine autism spectrum disorder, and your specialty subject is astronomy and math, chances are you will find literature and writing extremely difficult.  So why is it that Christopher, who is obsessed with astronomy and math, is able to write a book?  That also makes no sense.  To top it off, there is absolutely nothing in the main character of Christopher that I as someone with ASD that I can relate to.  For one thing, Christopher talks about autism so much it's mind-numbing--as if that's all there is to him.  In reality, I as someone with ASD do not think about it on a daily basis.  There are times when I think about it more, but such times are few and far between--and when they happen they are usually by some sort of trigger, such as a news article I read online.  Why is it like that for me?  Because I know there is more to me and others with ASD than just the ASD and the special interests we have.  Another thing is that Christopher acts like he has no ability whatsoever to emote or empathize with others.  True--people with autism, myself included, do have difficulties identifying what themselves and others are feeling.  But difficulties doing that don't mean that the ability to emote and the ability to empathize don't exist.  There was nothing to suggest that Christopher could do that or even that he wanted to be able to do that.  Instead, he just does whatever he wants to, calling people stupid just because he disagrees with them or because he can do math that I can't in the process, and doing things that make absolutely zero sense.  And now people who actually have an ASD are being stereotyped against this odious example of what autism \\"is\\".  And then they wonder why they're shocked when the real people with ASD bear no resemblance to this novel or why people with autism think this novel is a disgrace to humanity.  My own father was one of the people surprised when I told him I regarded this book as disgusting and why he kept saying he thought he knew what was going on in my head just because he read one novel.  In essence, if you're looking to understand what autism really is, do not read this novel.  You will only waste your time and be left more confused than you need to be.  There are much more accurate and much more interesting sources of what autism is out there.  This book is not one of them--and how it got published in the first place is beyond me.
1451648537|5.0|On a scale of 1 to 5, this biography is a 10. I am not usually much for reading biographies, but this one is compelling, even exciting. As I write this review, it has been only 45 days since Steve Jobs died. Thus, I find it amazing that I am just finishing Walter Isaacson's masterful piece of work about the life of one of my heroes. It has been on the stands for less than a month and already it is on Amazon's list of the year's 100 best books. So, why my interest? Part of it is due to my status as a \\"Mac person.\\" I have worked on Apple computers since the days of Apple IIe, when one of these machines was all that was available in the department (i.e., the biology department of Miami Dade College's Kendall Campus). Somehow, a bit later I scored a school-owned Mac SE, with its tiny 9-inch monochromatic screen. That computer, however, did not survive the trashing of our home by Hurricane Andrew in 1992. I then decided it was time to buy my own, so I went through the underwhelming Performa 6400 and, when it died, moved to the Power Mac G4 (still working), and finally to the MacBook Pro laptop, on which I am creating this review. Steve Jobs was the person, more than anyone else, responsible for putting these devices in my hands. I am happy now to have Isaacson's recounting of the four phases of Jobs' life: pre-Apple (his early life), Apple 1 (prior to his ouster), NeXT/Pixar (prior to his return), and Apple 2 (after his return). The author conducted many, many interviews with people who knew Steve (including some who loved him and some who didn't). Steve gave Isaacson carte blanche in painting an accurate picture of this complex man, who, it is fair to say, would not have been easy to like, especially if one was an employee (or a wife, child, or competitor). Nonetheless, Jobs was responsible for creating the Apple culture by his end-to-end strategy involving the marriage of computer hardware and software and that of technology and the humanities, which has characterizedthe Apple approach to the present, except for the regrettable period between Apple 1 and Apple 2 when John Sculley and Gil Amelio ruled the roost. Does anyone still have a functioning Power Computing Mac clone? Probably not. That company, although successful, only had a two-year run (1995-1997), because Steve killed the Mac cloning business when he returned to Apple as interim CEO. Another major breakthrough for Apple and Steve came with the concept of the \\"digital hub,\\" i.e., the coordination of a range of devices to play music, record video, and take photographs. In a sense, the digital hub concept was an extension of the end-to-end strategy, and led, in succession, to the iPod, iPhone, and iPad. It also gave rise to the Apple and iTunes stores. For many people, any one of these accomplishments, the desktop computer, the laptop computer, the music player, the phone, the tablet computer, would have sufficed to define one's impact on the world, but Steve Jobs was not interested simply in impacting the world; he wished to \\"make a dent in the universe.\\" One of the really interesting aspects of Steve's makeup discussed by Isaacson is the major contrast between the thinking prowess of this man as related to techno-domination and the cracked approach to his personal life, especially his health. I think that the author makes the case that both his ability to make technological magic and his willingness to ignore the unavoidable resulted from his practice of the so-called \\"reality distortion field.\\" Jobs believed that he could remake the rules by which the universe operates. In business, this might mean that he could push people to perform beyond their understanding of their own capacities so as to meet ostensibly unachievable deadlines. In his personal life, reality distortion could allow for the ignoring of medical advice about the neuroendrocrine pancreatic cancer that killed him. While some might regret his decisions that seem to have hastened his death, we need to remember that it is much more common for humans to live in a reality distrotion field than it is for them to own up to reality and get on with their lives in the real world. When Steve Jobs died on October 5th of this year, the company he began released a statement acknowledging that \\"Steve's brilliance, passion and energy were the source of countless innovations that enrich and improve all of our lives.\\" This has certainly been the case for me and I am indebted substantially to Walter Isaacson for his look at Steve's life, which I highly recommend to anyone interested in how this man dented the universe. Now, since Apple has a new board chairman, it remains to be seen what the answers will be to two key questions. Will Apple retain its innovative edge under new leadership and will the new leadership be able to create a proper tribute to Steve Jobs' greatness?
B004H7QICG|4.0|I bought this case while replacing a machine that had an older version of the same case. I still love it. It's very well built, quiet, etc. Antec does a great job of thinking about the little things so using it is just a nice experience overall.  The only real complaint is that it has these snazzy vents in the doors. One of the vents is over the power and reset buttons, so they can be pressed with the door closed. That's pretty epic fail! If you don't care about that, consider this a 5-star review.
B005JZBP8W|5.0|Scanning over some of the negative reviews of earlier edtions of \\"My Fair Lady\\" I was shocked by the petty criticisms of this or that.  I'm old enough that I saw a \\"road\\" production of this fabulous musical and I remain a fan.  The Blu-ray edition is magnificent on a 55 inch Samsung. The special features are informative and appreciated.  Regardless of what many say, I still feel that it was a tradgedy - a stupid decision - not to cast Julie Andrews at Elisa Doolittle. Audrey Hepburn does a fine job as Elisa, but the dubbed singing doesn't measure up to Julie's recordings. This Blu-ray DVD \\"My Fair Lady\\" is highly recommended.
B0055SWM08|5.0|got this based on reviews and was not disappointed.  nice graphics, interesting puzzles and relaxing music make this a nice buy for $0.99
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|It gets the job done, and for pdfs it is a lot better than the kindle reader, but I cant help think that there is a lighter weight Pdf reader out there. It takes a while to load and what is really annoying.is how slow the menus are, like for the book marks and file browsing.

1423140591|5.0|This book is the continuation of another series and is the second book in the continuation. In this book Percy, who is a greek demigod, must fight for the roman legion and return the lost golden eagle. He must also regain his memories, help a harpy, and save the world. This book is a great example of Rick Riordan's work. He combines a wonderful dose of greek and roman mythology with the 21st century. I enjoy these books because they provide very vivid imagery and action packed sequences. I can not wait for the next one to come out.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|First of all I would like to point out that anyone who pre-ordered this case or purchased it when it was 39.99 got a 10.00 refund in Amazon credit when the price was dropped. For 29.99 this case is not that bad, and people are just angry because it wasn't what they had expected. Too many people just look at pictures without reading product descriptions. The case is EXACTLY as advertised, and it works great so stop complaining. It DOES fold and stand with the weight of the kindle inside, so don't bother trying to stand the case up before you insert your kindle (what I suspect some people may have done) Also, in order for it to stand the folded flap must rest inside the groove on the back...obviously. It will work if you just know how to do it. I was able to get it to stand on a pile of pillows while laying in bed, so it seems to be sturdy enough without coming unfolded. Yes, the cover is felt on the inside, which I think is great for keeping condensation off the screen, collecting dust, and preventing scratches, so I don't know why people complain about that either. What were you expecting, silk? I also read some people complaining that the strap is glued. Well actually, it goes through a small slit on the back side, and on the inside it comes through and it appears as though it is in fact glued; however, for such a case this is really the only plausible way to attach a strap, and this company seemed to do so with precision, so I doubt the strap will come off unless you pull on it intending to do so. Overall this seems to be an excellent product, especially since the price drop, and I DO recommend it to anyone who wants to protect their Kindle for a decent price.

B0053B347M|3.0|Just got this kit today and plugged it in.  Should have listened to other reviews about the effectiveness of this. I plugged it in and adhered it to the back of my 24\\" display toward the upper middle.  I can see the light fine, but I don't think it's really bright enough to make a difference.  I have photography post-production business have been retouching images from 9am - 3am for the last week (this is the busy time of year), so we'll see very shortly if it really makes a difference.  I've got one these lightbars [...] that I use in my office to (I work in very dim light) and I think it would work better as Bias lighting than this light kit.

B0009P5YXO|5.0|I'd have to say im really happy with the sonic screwdriver, is says what it does and i love how it makes the noise. The only thing I dont really like about this is that the ink nub things are fairly easy to pull off so if you have it in your pocket and you pull it out and you think you droped it, it probably came off in your pocket. Oh and BTW, the title is a refrence from an episode of Doctor Who where the doctor meets Jack Harkness and Jack crashed a medical space craft thing, if you didnt know.
B000QUCPWU|5.0|I loved Green Onions the first time I heard it and when I heard it on a TV commercial recently I realized I didn't have it.  I do now.  The CD also includes Time Is Tight, which was written by members of the group.
B001I9O9L8|5.0|As a youngster I saw this film in the movie theaters. This blu-ray looks exactly the same. Perfect theater quality! In interviews over the years Michael Apted noted he chose specific film types for specific amounts of grain in his movies. As any Film pro will tell you, grain = detail NOT the opposite. Grain structure is preserved nicely and thus Michael Apted's vision. Kudos to those involved not using crappy DNR which destroys fine detail.<br /><br />Both the DTS-MASTER Audio and Lossless PCM 2 channel Audio are highly crankable and sound amazing. Kudos again to those involved this time for not squashing the audio via digital crap-ery [Limiting, etc].<br /><br />My only gripe is that there was more than enough space left on the disc to have included additional 1980's music videos from the Dream of The Blue Turtles album. That said this Blu-Ray is a must have for any Police or Sting fan!
B005HSG3VK|2.0|I purchased this case as a pre-order so that it was available when my new Fire arrived. I was surprised by the insubstantial material used in its construction. The cover portion feels like cardboard. It does function as a stand, but gives the impression that it will fail shortly. The bottom (near the power button cutout) is not finished correctly, causing it to rub while holding the Fire in portrait. Overall, I'm disappointed with the product and have returned it. Based upon other reviews, there are much better products on the market.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have been using this keyboard since this summer.  It really makes my typing faster. I send hundreds of texts a day for my job and with it learning my patterns I barely have to actually type anymore.  The only issue I am having is after the update my version is showing as 2.1.0.271. I have uninstalled and reinstalled and it still shows this. Does Amazon not really have 2.2 yet?  Does the version number just not show properly?
B005TBWN0K|5.0|One of the easieast, most intuitive touchscreen drawing apps I've ever tested (as author of \\"Best iPad Apps\\" and the forthcoming \\"Kindle Fire: The Missing Manual\\", I've test LOTS). Love how the touch-and-then-move-what-you've-drawn gesture just works. Wish all my drawing apps (computer and tablet) worked this well).
B003UESJDS|3.0|Another art house flop at the box office, this Stephen Frears (\\"The Queen\\") film features Gemma Arterton  (\\"Prince of Persia\\") in all her sexpot best.  She kind of reminds me of Bridget Bardot from the 1950's and 60's.  She flirts, she shows off her sexual skills and ultimately does the right thing.  The film, set in pastoral England involves a gaggle of writers trying to put pen to paper or computer and publish something.  The owner and his wife run the retreat & farm.  He is also a relatively famous writer for a series of novels and in spite of his age (50 something) is still a hit with young attractive ladies. But he still loves his wife...uh huh.  The farce has a few titters and the byplay between 2 teeny-boppers (watch out for up and coming actress Jessica Barden) and a rock star are pretty funny, but ultimately the comedy and the drama don't seem to match up well.  Still, it is a modestly entertaining film.
B004LUS390|5.0|I only have a small amount of time to play this, but this app is extremely similar to the one my art professor uses when he makes sketches on this tablet pc (the really old laptop with swivel screen and a digitizer) and it's very intuitive.   It took me a few short minutes to learn the ins and outs of the program and the shortcuts are extremely fast to work with and it's a good barebones version of photoshop.   The only thing is, now I have the urge to go buy a stylus so I can make better use of this app. I'm no fan of \\"finger painting\\" so I wanna get a proper stylus so I can draw on this thing properly.
B005KMX866|3.0|I've been a Chris Isaak fan ever since 1985's \\"Silvertone\\" which I have on cassette! He's a strong singer with a voice and style similar to Elvis. I often buy music not exactly sure what I'm going to get and this was no exception. Isaak pays tribute to Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison and others with this 2 disc warmed over package of covers. Isaak is in good voice and his band is impeccable. At the same time, these are not really any different in tone or substance from the originals. Disc 1 at 35 minutes is the better of the two. Disc 2 is a scant 28 minutes. So 2 discs that total 63 minutes, well short of what could have fit on 1 CD. Perhaps the best thing about the package is the booklet that came with it. Isaak gives a brief history of the musical influences in his life and his recording experience making this album which is sonically excellent. Hopefully he will put out some new stuff soon.
0553801473|2.0|I couldn't resist writing a review for this book because I can't finish it. I usually devour books like this (fantasy) in a few days. This one has been two weeks, because I no longer have the desire to return to it. Cliff notes at the bottom!<br /><br />Spoilers follow!<br /><br />While a Feast for Crows followed the slightly interesting lives of some characters I had never heard of, or even wanted to hear of, a Dance with Dragons followed the characters we love through hundreds of pages of uneventful journeys described in high definition. The entire book (minus the last few chapters - which I haven't read) seems to have been a zoom-in on all of the things that happen between exciting plot developments. To top it off, I find that I care less and less about the surviving characters, whereas in the previous books I found myself loving characters I had initially despised.<br /><br />I wish Daenerys would get moving, or get iced. Her disappearing was the best thing to happen to a Dance with Dragons. Reading her chapters was like reading 90% of people's blogs online - after every one I wondered why anybody would waste their time writing it. If all pictures were of food, I would think Mr. Martin had taken the saying about the worth of 1,000 words literally. Having read about 900 pages of the book in the past two weeks, I find myself unable to remember any specific event besides the crows' group stab therapy session with their Lord Commander, and Melisandre foreshadowing his rebirth as Azor Azhai. I'm pretty sure Tyrion's still alive, although at his current rate he'd have been just as interesting as a corpse. Arya's still...doing whatever she does, eventually to emerge as the preteen woman-power assassin. Wyman Manderly had his throat slit and bled everywhere, but I guess he was so fat he lived...which is good because his teasing of the Freys was one of the few delightful moments of the book.<br /><br />Cliffs: If you are looking at this because you have just finished reading A Feast for Crows, I'm sorry, you've already read one book too many from this series. A Dance with Dragons will leave you further disillusioned with A Song of Ice and Fire than Crows did. If you stumbled upon this review before reading A Feast for Crows, save yourself the agony and pretend the story ends at the Red Wedding with Catelyn getting a some kind of strange facial and then a Colombian necktie. If you haven't read any of it...well at least now you won't get attached to Catelyn!
B005HSG3U6|1.0|Well this thing is absolutely crap-tabulous as so many others have stated in their own words. Its exactly as another customer described as far as feeling like the cover is made of 2 pieces of flimsy cardboard and not possibly costing more than 50 cents to make. How they could ever have charged $40 for this or even 30 is beyond me. Before this case even arrived I ordered a second one made by SPLASH with the expectation that I would be compelled to send this one back which I absolutely will because it absolutely sucks. Also the \\"stand\\" mechanism is the most feeble attempt at making anything sit up I have ever seen. A calm breeze would blow it over with ease. It literally just barely catches on the notch made in the hard part of the case. It's pathetic that that was the masterful idea this company came up with for a $40 case -_-. You know what you could buy with $40? A REAL case and a half. I advise you to browse through the rest of the case selection. I would never have bought this thing if I hadn't pre-ordered it and had a chance to read the reviews first. The end.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|very good nice season 2 from the fisrt season best series starz has done if you can get the first series too it's even better.
B002ZG98J6|5.0|>>> This is a review of the BD+DVD+Digital Copy >>><br /><br />Just so we know up front, I had no knowledge of the books until long after I first saw the movie. And I must say, despite a few off-beats from acting, it can fall into the epic. The plot is hashed down as it has been since times immemorial - middle-class nobody discovers powers beyond their reason. Then he gets a magic sword. Sound like Star Wars, Episode IV? That's where the similarities end. Period.<br /><br />Percy Jackson is a demigod, the only son of Poseidon.  This is the brilliance of the movie before it even gets to the good stuff - we aren't treated to yet another in the long lines of Zeus's bastard sons. Here's a great look at what can happen when folk start to think for themselves. My understanding is that in the books, he is younger enough to make inferences to Harry Potter. And thank the cast and crew for not letting the film fall that way.<br /><br />The MacGuffin is nothing less then the Thunderbolt of Zeus. A short but brilliant scene between Poseidon and Zeus (portrayed by Sean Bean, and with an intensity that makes short work of Liam Neesen's own portrayal of the Greek God Zeus. Sorry, Liam). that show there is no doubt that Sean Bean's Zeus WILL kick your butt backwards if you so much as look at him wrong. The other performances range from awesome (Poseidon - epic Kevin McKidd from Grey's Anatomy, the satyr, Medusa, and best of all Persephone - a delicious and enchanting Rosario Dawson) to slightly forced (Chiron the centaur, Annabelle Chase, Percy's mom). Not that they perform poorly at all; they just fall slightly behind the power-houses previously mentioned (i.e Rosario Dawson).<br /><br />And the highest praise to be Logan Lerman. This is a role that could easily become a poor Harry Potter or Sorcerer's Apprentice, but he steps up to plate for an incredible performance. When he comes into his deific powers, you can see the change in his demeanor, slowly at first. By the end, we believe he can kick butt without Olympian intervention.<br /><br />The special features of this film includes standards like featurettes and deleted scenes. Also included is little interactive \\"What Are Your Powers\\" quiz, a bit forced itself, but the kiddos' love it.<br /><br />Thankfully, Olympus deems this film worthy of a sequel. Now, if you'll excuse me so I can go read a book....ieve he can kick butt without Olympian intervention.<br /><br />The special features of this film includes standards like featurettes and deleted scenes.

B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I really like the way Emily Giffin writes since it feels like a real situation is taking place and I am somehow there in the mayhem.  This book is the sequel to \\"Something Borrowed\\" and it really ties everything together! I definitely recommend this book, especially if you have read \\"Something Borrowed.\\"  My advice, read \\"Something Borrowed\\" first so you get the entire experience! Awesome read! Do it!
B005HGZVEM|5.0|This is a excellent quality CD! Chris Isaak captured the golden age of rock'n'roll not only with his voice but also the back-up musicians who accompanied him!
030746363X|5.0|Great book.  Lost 20 pounds the first month and 34 pounds since starting; averaging 1-2 pounds a week.  The cheat day helps it seem more like a life-style change than a diet.
B00511PTWM|5.0|It's as simple as this: You've got a phone, and you've got a GPS. Your car has only one cigarette lighter (hard to believe we still refer to these as such), but both items need to be charged. The battery life of a modern cell phone is still not great, and it's even worse for GPS devices. This handy item enables you to charge both at the same time while on the road. I've used a number of products from AmazonBasics, and they always live up to the hype: they're simple, easy to use, and have very clear advantages. This adapter won't change your life, but it'll make one aspect just a little more convenient.
B002FGU4EY|1.0|I tried the original Fi 3, then the newer model with a supposedly software shock pad, and they both had the same effect. It feels like you have a stone in your shoe. Why would ANYONE want a shock pad that's harder than the rest of the footbed? Doesn't the heel take the most pressure? This remains the dumbest design idea I've ever seen, and I will never buy another pair of Tevas until the shock pad is completely removed.

B0033B5XCS|4.0|I saw princeob's review and I also received a double-sided disc which was the first disc in the package but it does play the 1st Nightmare on Elm street with Johnny Depp but it doesn't play Freddy Vs. Jason. 0_0 The disc is also blank there isn't any picture on it. I have yet to see all of them but I was worried about the 1st movie so I checked that one out. It's definitely a good buy if you love the whole \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\" movies.
B005D9B26E|1.0|Over $100 for this?  a) Only some of the tracks are 5.1.  b)  No Who demos, all Pete.  No Who outtakes.  No Who alternate versions.  c) Some of the demos have added (redone) drums.  d) No extra live stuff either.  e) The 5.1 mixes aren't even that great.  Tommy was much better.  More immersive, more \\"powerful\\".  Shame.  Even if we would have just gotten the whole thing as 5.1 I would have been happy.  But no.  This is a half effort ... and for over $100.  Looks at Dark Side of the Moon or Wish You Were Here for how it should be done.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Much like Arrested Development, Firefly had a great cast, terrific writing, and a unique style. Then Fox canceled it prematurely. Since then it has lived on in movie, comics and conventions. Joss Whedon FTW
B00005JLEU|5.0|My all time favorite movie! Hayao Miyazaki's movies are all fantastic. However, Howl's Moving Castle, Ponyo, and this one are my favorite! I don't feel it is not appropriate for kids under 12, but, WOW WHAT AN INCREDIBLY AWESOME EXPERIENCE! I wish I walked through life as gracefully as the heroine in Spirited Away.
0812975219|2.0|This book had plenty of interesting facts, points and concepts posited, but the reading of the book itself is less than great. I would've enjoyed the book much more with a better writing style that scripted the text rather than regurgitated the factoids. The interesting tidbits the author has studied aren't compelling enough on their own without a solid background to wrap it all together and move the reader along.

0767802470|5.0|So why am I giving Das Boot 5 stars if I object to the ending?  Because, overall, it's a marvelous production.  And, as I said, the ending is necessary to carry the anti-war theme.  However, in December of 1941, when the U-boat returns to its French base, German air defenses were so strong and British capabilities in offensive air operations so weak that such an attack, especially with so little warning, simply would not have occurred.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|Plain and simple, this is a wonderful movie that never gets old. It is a movie parents and their children will both enjoy.  And this price can't be beat!

B0052UZIFA|5.0|l have this game on my PC and like it, so I bought it for my phone (galaxy s2 skyrocket) and it's just as fun. Well worth the money spent.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|What a joke. So disappointed. really don't waste your money on this.   I got because I wanted to have it angled to read on plane without holding. That doesn't work. The thing is soooooo flimsy that it would make any  device it holds look awful.  Really bad quality.  So now have to return it....Don't want to trust this company with next level up.
0385535139|4.0|The story is set in the law practive at Finley and Figg in the southwest ourskirts of Chicago.  They have been plodding along for years doing the bread and butter work of the legal profession, car wrecks, divorces, wills, etc.  Then David Zinc, a stressed out and overworked associate attorney at a mega law firm abandons ship and ends up at their office.  Wally Figg has his eye on the big score and becomes involved in a class action case against a major drug company.  Then things being to exspand, implode, and put everyone on the ropes.  It becomes a case of legal manuevering where money talks, and some people are left holding the bag.  You meet characters, good and bad, along the way.  Some people do get justice, but not everything turns out the way that some people expected.  David gets an on-the-job crash course in the practice of tort cases.<br /><br />The story does not have quite the legal suspense of [[ASIN:0345532023 The Appeal: A Novel]], or the page turning suspense of [[ASIN:0440245117 The Confession]] but it is a well written story, and I would expect three or four star ratings.  Of course some reviewers feel they have to look at the negative and never have anything good to say (although they claim that they are still buying the books - in some cases Amazon has not verified that, so you have to use your own judgement).
B004LUS390|4.0|Works great on my Nexus 1. No native tablet support.  There is a separate tablet app for ttablets. The tablet app is more expensive but still worth the price.   For me there are two issues, one perhaps is android related. There should be a &quot;package&quot; deal for those of us that need both phone and tablet versions. hopefully ICS will make this kind of split packaging more difficult.  Second, Autodesk.  For the 4 to 5 figures that I pay annually in subscriptions couldn't they throw in the mobile apps for free!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|syncs with my Kindle Fire and with my Asus tablet so i have access to handwritten and typed notes wherever i go.
B005POK858|5.0|Good storyline, multiple party characters, and a good map layout.  As a FF lover, I'd have to say, this game is pretty good. It's easy enough to play, with some tough bosses that make you use a little strategy. The map is well laid out, and there are plenty of random enemy encounters. I highly recommend this app.
0307887960|4.0|Both my husband and I have lost more than 20 pounds and consider the Dukan diet a chosen life style. It was not difficult to diet as we were never hungry and the recipes are very satisfying. I would recomment this diet to everyone.
1451629184|4.0|Perhaps it could only be written the way it was, and that in itself would make it difficult to give less than 5 stars, but the necessary flaws in this book did affect my reading experience. When speaking of the years that so much of her was shut down...the narrative reflects that. Unfortunately, that part of the book I tended to skim as it was as shut down as she herself had to be.<br />That being said, it is both eerie and heartbreaking to read the words of what truly is a woman who survived the gruesome theft of her childhood. This book is a reminder that the evil we think of as existing only in the darkest corners of some person we will never meet, can live in people we have probably had casual contact with.<br />To be honest, I bought this book solely because I felt it was important to support the work of Ms. Dugard. I'm glad I did. I like knowing that she will get a portion of my money spent on it. She deserves that and so much more.
B001UV4XJ2|2.0|Love the movie - this review is not about the movie...this review is about the product/package.  I realized only upon delivery that this was the dreaded Ultraviolet and not the traditional Digital Copy that I could download to my computer/iTunes and load onto an iPad.  Ultraviolet is really a disaster...everyone here is chiming in on that and they are correct...  I read online that if you complain to WB/UV support by email they will send you an iTunes code.  I did that and received the code in about one hour.  For that I give them an extra star.  I now have the move in iTunes and on my iPad.
0345529057|4.0|This is an amazing fantasy series also the presentation of the box set is lovely. i highly recommend this if you think you would like a lord of the rings esk story that's more political and with less crazy creatures. Some great characters and page turning story.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I downloaded this app to troubleshoot problems I was having in my wi-fi network with some people being unable to see my access point's SSID advertisements. Within a few minutes this app gave me enough information to solve my problems!<br /><br />The two most useful parts of the display were the channel spread per access point, and the signal strength. The channel spread showed me that I'd picked the same channel for my wireless network (11) as my neighbors, which was causing conflicts. I moved to channel 3 and there was no longer spectrum overlap. Also, another display showed the DB strength of my wireless signal, which made me realize that the placement of my router is less than optional. Not bad for 10 minutes with an app I used with a wireless deployment I've had for months.<br /><br />If you're experienced with wi-fi, this is a useful diagnostic tool. If you're NOT experienced with wi-fi, this might still show you some interesting info. I recommend it!
1617930350|1.0|This book, I think, is her worse ever, It was so boring. The author (in this case I use the term lightly) repeats and repeats the same thing...just changes the wording. The little Bookstore on our corner will hardly carry this author anymore. Too much of the same old thing. Don't waste your hard earned $. This REALLY is a waste of time and money. The author must be just trying to get another book on the shelf. I will not be buying anymore of hers. I saw on Amazon that they will have a limited Edition for $160. They surely are kidding...is it April Fool's Day early?
1400052181|3.0|This was a gripping and informative read, but it lost much of its attraction around half way through the book.  I felt an effort to continue reading.  However, it was informative to the end.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I bought this to shoot a short film with and at first I was insanely mad because it didnt sound much better than an on-board mic on my 60D. However once I got it into the editing room, the audio was fantastic. No hum, no buzz, perfect audio. And whats even better is that there can be external mics connected to it to have a 4-way audio channel. Im actually very interested in using it for music recording as well now. But for all my DSLR filmakers out there it works great.
B000AQJPQE|4.0|I bought this for my kid's room about a month ago. It does what you expect. It's easy to put together. The screws included in the box are not ideal but I bought better screws from Home Depot. The light inside sun is very dim so at night you can not see the planets unless room light is on. Other than that it's a good product.
0743297334|5.0|Ernest Hemingway pioneered the way for a revolutionary literary technique known as the Iceberg Theory. His writing became famous for evoking true sentiment without the use of dull, verbose language. On the surface, it appears that the words are very simple; sentences containing only three words or less are everywhere. The true wonder of The Sun Also Rises doesn't lie in its simplicity, but in the fact that the true emotion lies underneath the words through the process of omitting what is unnecessary to reveal the more important themes that too many words can mask.  As Hemingway's debut novel, this book is a literary landmark. Modern writers give more consideration to deciding whether they would rather emulate Hemingway's style or avoid it than any other author. His style is very unique and broke new ground during his time. Hemingway uses terse prose focusing on short, truncated sentences and long passages of dialogue mixed with vivid description and subtle but powerful characterization.  The Sun Also Rises is the quintessential novel of the \\"lost generation\\" of youth after WWI. Jake Barnes, the hopelessly depressed main character, has suffered a traumatic injury during the war that has left him impotent and unable to physically support his true love, Lady Brett Ashley. Brett is consumed by social norms and cannot allow herself to be with Jake because of his condition, claiming she would \\"tromper\\" him with other men. The relationship between these two characters, narrated by Barnes, is absolutely brilliant. The futility of love as well as the aimlessness of life carries the book.  Other characters include the Jewish middleweight champion and semi-accomplished writer, Robert Cohn. Cohn is constantly teased by Brett's partner, Mike Campbell, a violent drunk who has gone bankrupt after the war but chooses decadence over frugality. Bill Smith, Jake's close friend, seems to be the least disillusioned member of Jake's group, but he is not without his violent tendencies.  The story focuses on the travels of these young men and Brett as they travel from Paris to Pamplona to see the Fiesta di San Fermin. The group seems to meander with no purpose, showing the accepted beliefs of veterans after WWI. They travel from place to place with no purpose, getting \\"tight\\" at every place they can.  The book climaxes with perhaps the greatest description of the Spanish countryside and culture in all of literature. In Pamplona, the friends witness the encierros de toros (literally \\"running of bulls\\") into the amphitheater where they watch Pedro Romero, a handsome and talented young bullfighter, do his work.   The beauty of this Spanish festival has forever been immortalized by Hemingway's simple prose that needs to be read to be believed. The near perfect detail of the European country and urban life is very believable. Hemingway has a good balance of choosing true sentiment over sentimentality. The book is simple yet complex, and very satisfying. The language contrasts between pages of dialogue that take very little time to read and pages of long, descriptive paragraphs. Sometimes this effect was dizzying as it took the reader in and out of the scenes too quickly. I often found myself confused when the tone would shift from very limited conversation to excessive, detailed paragraphs about the surrounding area. It also didn't help that three or more people are usually speaking at once, and an indication of who is actually speaking is rarely presented. Sometimes there is no way to tell, but the reader can assume who is speaking based on their choice of words (Jake speaks very little, Brett applies forced British slang).  Very often, the reader forgets that the characters in the book are American. At times, even the characters themselves need to be reminded. The characters are pseudo-intellectuals, abandoning their morals to assimilate into the luxury of European culture. They believe that money can truly buy them friends, and they flaunt about theirsuccesses but rarely reflect on their flaws.  The excessive use of alcohol may not be appropriate for everyone. In nearly every scene, the characters are drinking or asking a friend to have a drink. Clearly, the characters are trying to escape from the traumas of the war. However, the repetition becomes predictable very early on and stays throughout the whole book. The idiosyncrasies of each character are only truly seen during their instances of extreme drunkenness, whether it be anti-Semitism or proclamations of love and hate or violence.  The novel ends much like it begins. Jake and Brett are in a car, hopelessly lost and in love. After the celebrations have ended, the two characters can't help ending up in the same place no matter how much they try to escape, much like the sun will always rise and fall in the same place every single day.  Only 1/8 of an iceberg is visible from the surface of the ocean. For readers of The Sun Also Rises, I recommend that you dig deep into the words on the page in order to reveal a better understanding of Hemingway's intention and to improve the reading experience overall.
1400079144|3.0|Many times I'll encounter a novel that grabs my attention and it is hard for me to put the book down.  This one did not grab my attention.  I found that what got the characters excited did not seem like a big deal to me.  I found Brown's other books much more engaging.  The writing also seemed a bit sloppy and a couple of issues that were brought up were not resolved to my satisfaction.<br /><br />I would only recommend this book to serious fans of Dan Brown.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've been a SwiftKeyer since the original. I was snagged by the very powerful prediction and learning abilities, which have made SwiftKey speak more and more in my voice as I've used it. But with each successive version, it's just gotten better and better. Now with the ability to learn from Twitter, facebook, SMS and email, two different typing styles, and a cornucopia of keyboard-related stats, SwiftKey is just hands down the best.<br /><br />You owe it to yourself to give at least the free trial a fair shake. Leave the default keyboard in the dust!

B003Y5H51K|1.0|Phenomenally poor dialogue punctuated by a lot of screaming and shouting.  The plot boils down to:  People dying because they do really stupid things - implausibly stupid.  And ... well, that's about it.  As other reviewers have noted, there are scenes of natural beauty.  But they can't make up for the time wasted watching this film.  Satisfy your curiosity and minimize the pain by borrowing it from a public library, or an unfortunate friend.

0452289963|2.0|I know this is one of Oprah's Book Club top-sellers and I also realize that many readers found this book to be quite enlightening, however, I really didn't.  I hold a graduate degree and also enjoy reading for pleasure but this book was a tough one for me.  This is not said to dissuade any potential readers but meant to prepare you if you were hoping to read it on an upcoming vacation or over the weekend.  It's fairly deep and you really have to take your time with it.  I did find parts of it useful -- for instance, he presents information on the ego which was interesting and helpful, and he also included nuggets of truth about the nature of the body, soul and spirit and some practical ideas which may often prove helpful in dealing with anxiety, anger and other issues people face.  However, that's about all I could really take from this book.  Admittedly, Tolle would say it's because I'm not \\"awakened\\" yet.  This book is veiled as being about how to awaken yourself and have a deeper walk with your spiritual soul; however, I'm a little surprised that so many Christians like it because Tolle places all faiths (Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, etc.) as being just as valid as the others.  While on one hand I recognize that our society wishes to be tolerate of one another and I can appreciate living in peace with all of my neighbors regardless of their faith or non-faith, I was really struck by how incompatible Tolle's perspective is with Biblical Christianity (e.g., Tolle says, \\"How 'spiritual' you are has nothing to do with what you believe, but everything to do with your state of consciousness.\\")  There is SO MUCH of this type of perspective throughout this book.  Just because he quotes Jesus throughout different parts of this book does not mean Tolle is promoting Christianity -- he certainly is not.  I would think that other faiths would have the same reaction.  Wish I had known this going into it.  For me, it was a disappointing read overall.
B005HV6Y84|2.0|First off, no Muse!  I was really looking forward to some new Muse-ik and was stunned to find NONE on the soundtrack.  What happened???  Okay, that aside, I had high hopes!  I have really enjoyed the first three soundtracks and felt very confident about the fourth, but it is so MELLOW!!!  The songs aren't bad, but I don't feel compelled to listen to it over and over like the first three.  I have listened to it five or six times now (I listen to music all day while I work) and it has sadly failed to grab me.  One of the best things about the first three was that they introduced me to some new (to me anyway) artists that I was not familiar with, but nothing here sparked my interest.  Perhap the Christini Perri song has caught my attention somewhat and Sister Rosetta is kind of fun.  The remake of Flightless Bird seems kind of pointless to me.  It prefer the original on the first soundtrack.  Hopefully the fifth will rock me more, but I don't see this one getting a lot of play :-(

B0041KKYCY|4.0|The movie was a good revenge movie and it had some parts that were tough to watch.  It was definately not for the light hearted viewer but more for the person that wants to see what happens when someone is done wrong.

B00009W0U4|5.0|This movie the viewer actually should watch twice.  The first time to understand that the procedure of how the events took place and attempt to get use to the angle shots during the film.  Viewing the movie the second time was when one realizes that events that take place during this film are so horrifying to have happened in the lives of those in the movie. The rape scene was so \\"realistic\\" and displayed the violent disruption of someone's life which caused the rest of the events to occur. It is a very twisted tale.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Looks great on my Kindle fire but wouldn't start. 10 minutes later, it would.  Who knows what was going on.   Anyway, it looks great and is nice to have a wide screen to play with finally.
B005DOKIYG|2.0|To start, I don't think is quite as bad as some of the other reviewers. Yes, it does smell of chemicals, but I suppose that's almost to be expected these days. Ultimately, I'm assuming that the smell will fade in the coming weeks and become a non-issue.  However, there remain two things that really, really bother me. First and foremost, the price is insane. When I laid down $30 on this thing I assumed, perfectly reasonably, that it would be of decent quality. Instead, it's got creases all over it which, while not horrific, do detract from the overall aesthetic. At the more subjective level, it just feels \\"cheap.\\" I think most of us know when we hold a quality product in our hand, and this isn't one sadly.  Secondly, it's extremely thin. This may not seem like a particularly big deal but it really is. Especially when you consider the question of, \\"Why would I buy this in the first place?\\" Well, presumably, to help protect your Kindle Fire from getting damaged. While I will concede that this \\"sleeve,\\" as they call it, will help protect from scratches on the screen, I doubt it will do much against drops and knocks.  At the end of the day, I just expected much more from both Amazon and my $30, and frankly, if it weren't for the amount of hassle involved (in returning an item to an online store), I'd just return this and get a different case right now.
0767830555|5.0|This film comes from the 1970s auteur period of nakedly awful stories about the dregs and losers.  I remember enjoying my reaction to this as an undergraduate, the way that it kind of freaked me out, which is a substitute for experience in the young.  This time around, while I recognize its significance, fine acting, and relentless realism, I half wondered why I was putting myself through it.  OK, you endure it for the sake of art, but it is so awful that I may never do so again, which leads to the question, why buy it?<br /><br />Scorsese, DeNiro, Keitel, and Foster completely deserve the praise they received.  They portray losers in the drama of a massive, then-deteriorating city, in which a man is going insane.  He pulls Keitel and Foster into his web of horror and alienation with the surety of a pendulum, to the unspeakable violence of the climax.  It is painful to watch:  a horrible story about horrible people to whom horrible things will happen.  Then there is the commentary on the media:  Travis becomes a hero by his action, though it is clear the pendulum continues to swing.<br /><br />There is also a very good documentary about the film.  It is a must for Scorsese fans and Taxi buffs.<br /><br />It is a great film, just not very fun.  I would recomend renting it rather than buying it.
B005HSG3VK|2.0|With the high price tag for this cover, I would expect much more than the flimsy cover I received when I pre-ordered this. As for offering protection against what I consider to be the most susceptible area of the Kindle, the cover had what seemed like felt glued onto a thin piece of rubbery cardboard. Definitely cheaply made and may be worth $10, but definitely not more than that.

B0052U59F4|4.0|As reviewed on [..]:  Anastasia Steele is looking forward to completing her final exams, graduating college, and starting her life in Seattle.  When her roommate, and best friend, falls ill making her unable to complete an interview for the school magazine, Ana allows herself to be drafted.  Upon meeting Christian Grey, CEO, she finds herself drawn to him in ways she's never been to anyone else.    Christian Grey is a force to be reckoned with.  He has become CEO of his own company at a very young age and is an enigma to most of the world.  He has a lot of secrets and a lot of scars, but finds Ana's sweet, open personality a balm to his wounded soul.  He sets out to make her his in the only way he knows how... but will it be enough?    OK.  This is another one of those stories where it's VERY hard to write a review.  Sometimes I think I should just skip some of these but... Darn it!  Some of them are just too good to pass up.  This story is awesome, wonderful,... and f'd up.  Early on, it's almost like a Cinderella story.  It's fun.  It's funny. It's hot as all get out... and by hot I mean smokin' HOT.  I'm laughing and having a great time reading it.  I LOVE some of the email exchanges.  I enjoyed learning about the characters.  I enjoyed the dance between them as they met and got to know each other a bit.  I even loved Christian's \\"stalker tendencies.\\"    But... then we hit the source of my problem. BDSM. Oh, no, I don't have a problem with it, but it would appear the author does.  In this story, BDSM is portrayed as depraved. As being entirely caused by problems from Christian's past. That if he is \\"healed\\" he won't need the control or the pain. It felt like she did a little superficial research into the lifestyle but missed several integral parts. In one scene, there is a belt lashing immediately after an argument when both parties are extremely worked up... Not Safe! Personally, I think I would have preferred the BDSM elements have been left out entirely instead of having it included in this way.    Nevertheless, I did enjoy Fifty Shades of Grey.  Overall, it's a very good book.  I can read stories where I disagree with a concept in it.  Shoot, I read the news all the time, right?  The author appears to be trying to make the relationship progress at a normal speed, rather than warp speed as it often does in books.  Unfortunately,  it makes it a bit of a long read and some parts of it drag a bit.  This book is also a \\"Part One.\\" **groan**  I knew there's a second one out there but I thought it was a second in a series, as in different main characters of a connected story, not a part two.  Now I find out that there's even a part three coming!    Bottom line.  If you want a steamy story with interesting characters, and don't really care about the BDSM portions, then READ READ READ this book!  However, if you have knowledge of BDSM, think seriously on whether or not you could suspend that while reading this book.  If not, don't read this book.  If you can, I'd give it a shot.

B005HSG3U6|4.0|Since joining the Kindle Revolution, I have always had my device with me wherever I go (previously, my Kindle Keyboard and now, my Kindle Fire).  My purse is always cluttered, disorganized, and crammed with enough stuff to survive a nuclear attack -- obviously, a protective cover is absolutely necessary.  Without one, my Fire would already have scratches and scuff marks all over it.<br /><br />I must admit that I was rather skeptical about this case when I pre-ordered it, and I was ready to mail it back to Amazon in a New York minute if it was subpar.  Every other case I've used for my other Kindle has always been the traditional, leather-bound protector.  However, I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised with this case!<br /><br />What about the strength and consistency of the shell itself?  Well, before I actually put my beloved new toy in this contraption, I decided to give it a few test runs.  I nudged it off of the couch onto the carpet -- no problems.  I took it up a notch and dropped it onto my hard-tiled kitchen floor -- nope, no issues.  At this point, my curiosity got the best of me, and I tossed it down the stairs -- the thing stayed closed and unharmed.  Alright, obviously throwing a Fire down the stairs, even with a case on, is stupid as the impact itself would probably be damaging.  I'm cutting my little experiment off before that step.  But my point is that the case didn't break, crack, or dent.  And since this case stayed closed through a tumble down the stairs, I'm adequately pleased with the elastic strap itself.  It's very useful for holding the cover back when you're using your Fire.<br /><br />The front cover of the Fire is made to flip back into a stand, so it's not the same super-sturdy material that cradles the rest of your device.  But it's not a soft-cover, either.  The cover bends in the middle so that it can fold into a stand, but that flexible area is sandwiched by two hard panels.  Again, it's not the same stuff as the rest of the case, but it's a hard material.<br /><br />The Fire fits perfectly into this case.  The corners that actually hold the Fire into the case are made of the same hard material; my Fire snapped right into place and hasn't moved since.  No jostling, no jiggling, no threat of escaping into the world unprotected.<br /><br />I will agree with other reviewers about its standing function to an extent.  The groove along the back of the case to hold the stand in place isn't as defined as necessary, in my opinion.  And if your Fire isn't resting on a completely flat, hard, horizontal surface, the stand will probably collapse.  It's been great on my bedside table for watching Wonder Years reruns before zonking out for the night... but when my boyfriend tried to set it on his dresser that had a slight lean to it, the stand slipped out of the groove immediately.  I then tried to set it on his ottoman -- which has a large, flat surface, albeit a soft one -- and the stand didn't work well at all.  Also, you might not want to bump into the table where your Fire is resting; the stand will go ker-splat.  I would mainly caution people to be vigilant about where and how you use your stands.  If your Fire falls while you're using the cover as a stand, your screen is unprotected.  Could get nasty.<br /><br />Overall, I'm a fan of this case with the one caveat that the stand is kinda hit or miss.  I guess it's like teaching a kid to ride a bike.  It's all good when the street is smooth, flat, and perfect.  But the second you throw in a turn or a bump in the road, little Johnny will wish he had training wheels.<br /><br />UPDATE: The white cover gets dirty VERY easily, and I haven't had any success in cleaning it.  The corners and edges have developed that dingy, brown taint, and it also picked up some of the fabric coloring from the inside of my purse.  Wouldn't be a problem if I could wash it off... but the stains seem to have permanently stuck.  I definitely recommend getting a darkercolor. :(

B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Been using for two days. Crashes with a force close once every 3-4 starts on the kindle Fire.   The ads in the upper right corner do not affect game play at all - hardly notice them after awhile.  If there is an update that fixes the force close, I would play more often.
0385344325|1.0|No need to recount the plot. Not much to recount anyway with so much repetition pushing so little development. Reacher said nothing. This was 1997. Reacher still said nothing. It was still 1997. Good grief. A corrupt senator colludes to cover-up the serial killings of his prima donna military son. Reacher proves nothing, but engages in his own set of serial killings. Reacher gratuitously blows off the head of a guy from a Tennessee militia. Yup, that Jack is one cold-blooded murderer. For the senator and his son, Reacher gets up close and personal, first suffocating them, then breaking their necks, then leaving the bodies on a train track for a spectacular finish. Jim Grant (who uses the pen name Lee Child) has made Reacher one sick puppy. Pass on this dog.

1439102813|3.0|Keep in mind that this tale is told from the perspective of a woman as she moves, so to speak, into the white room of Altzheimer's Disease. As such, much of the anguish and unsavoury bits of Altzheimer's are peripheral. It is sometimes said that the victims of AD are the patient's caregivers, for they are left to bear witness to progressive loss, to grieve, and to tend to the many unsavoury bits. Alice is left unawares. Even the ending has Alice exhibiting insight into her daughter's theatric work, insight not shown by other Ivy League family. But once locked inside the white room of AD, is she really \\"still Alice\\" as the author entitles the work? Without memories or language or reasoning or any means of re-connecting, one has to suspect that Alice doesn't live here anymore.
B0001E7LMU|4.0|We played this at my son's home, who has children of 11, 7, and 6.  This was about the only game the 7 yr old girl would play with us.  Even the six year old was able to play this and enjoy it.  It is like the old Waterworks game but better.  I would keep playing this over and over with adults, but we really enjoyed playing it as a family.

B000QGEB12|5.0|I can't add anything to the numerous careful, detailed analyses already up, so I won't try.  Except for this:  the various fight scenes are truly outstanding.  It is one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen.  Buy it; like a good book, every time you enjoy it, you'll notice something new.
B004HO6HWA|4.0|This is a remake of a 1972 Charles Bronson movie, but I have not seen that one so I can't compare it to this one. Don't confuse it for the Transporter movie franchise even if it stars the same man and the word mechanic would make you think cars. This movie (and what it excels in) is about the fine art of assassinry (if that's a word). Not shooting people, but slipping in, killing them and making it look like natural causes without anyone ever knowing you were there. Jason Statham plays the Mechanic \\"Bishop\\" who is hired to assassinate a lot of men and who shortly after the movie starts gets an apprentice. It is not a buddy movie, there are no comedic quips. The Mechanic stays with a serious tone. Bishop trains the apprentice in his art of assassinry, and the apprentice is quite sloppy which leads to the bigger action sequences. Predictably gun fights with security officers and other assassins come after them.  The plot is predictable and it is still a good movie if you can get into it, but I can see how some might call this movie dull at first, without crazy action sequences, car chases or explosions (until much later). There is good cinematography and a lot of locales, everything from lush drug mansions to dirty street ghettos. Some nice spy technology gets used.
0142501123|5.0|I ordered this a few weeks before Halloween because of the positive reviews and my need for a Halloween book to read to my 3 y/o's preschool class. Now that we've owned this book for 6 weeks I cannot even begin to count how many times we've read it. My 3 y/o begs me to read the witch book and the only one that loves it more than her is my 18 m/o. She will find the book and immediately begins smiling and running toward me with it. They both sit captivated through the whole book and usually make me read it at least twice in a single sitting. The book is written in rhyme and has a wonderful rhythm. The description recommends it for children 4-8, and while I think they'd enjoy it as well, I definitely recommend it enthusiastically for the younger set.   P.S. I purchased this in October 2011 and the book had the correct \\"witch with french fries\\" line

1614270198|5.0|This book has inspired me big time. Change the negative, limiting records playing in the subconscious and change your reactions and feelings. I've never \\"stepped out\\" or done anything different in life, because of fear due to trauma and false beliefs about myself. My new goal in life isn't to \\"seem great\\" and acquire a bunch of things anymore. I want a strong, robust, serene character and the ability to give good advice and inspire people. This book is defnitely helping me to become a stronger person. What goes into the mind, comes out in some form. Be ever so careful what you allow in it. We had no say in how we were developed when we were young, but we can change it through persistence and desire.
B005DOL0R0|4.0|Received promptly. It is well padded and the attention to detail is there. My only complaint is the smell, it smells really awful. Hopefully that goes away soon.
0385535139|4.0|John Grisham's THE LITIGATORS is a fun romp through the life of a small group of lawyers that get in way over their head when they file a lawsuit against the third biggest pharmaceutical company in the country, Varrick Pharmaceuticals.<br /><br />Oscar Finley and Wally Figg have been chasing ambulances for years. David Zinc just had a nervous breakdown and quit his job at the 100 hour work week big firm. Zinc begins a new career as an associate at Finley and Figg. Figg believes he's found the next big thing. All across the country, tort lawyers are suing Varrick for the drug Krayoxx. They think Varrick will settle and they'll all make millions.<br /><br />Why this is a good novel: This novel is lighthearted and humorous. The action is fast a furious and Finley and Figg make one mistake after another. Zinc isn't much better, but manages to make enough right moves to emerge as the hero of the story. Also, thankfully, Grisham isn't trying to make a point with this novel. He's not bashing big drug as much as pointing out the flaws in tort trial lawyers. If he was trying to send a message, at least he didn't beat the reader over the head with it.<br /><br />Why this novel isn't ver good: Grisham's 3rd person head hopping style makes it hard to get close to anyone character. In one single page, you can read about the viewpoints of three to four characters. Grisham is the only major author I read that writes like this. David Zinc is the most interesting character, but we never really get close to him because any intimate moments are swept away by the immediate switch to another character.<br /><br />Most readers, including diehard Grisham fans, should enjoy this novel. However, it in no way captures the magic that surrounded his great novels of the 1990s.
B001CEE1YE|5.0|I actually have the first of the series but not in Blu-Ray.  My husband and I really got into the movie this time, really got into it, and decided to get the whole series.  The one we chose may not have all the gimmicks that the other Blu-ray choices had but it definitely had the movies.  Wow, after watching my old DVD, we went through the whole series in a weekend - unusual for us to do.  Blu-ray is awesome.  As usual, Amazon sent it quickly with no problems and at good prices.  So many choices, it was hard to pick.  We are very happy with the one we chose.
0439023491|5.0|CATCHING FIRE, by Susanne Collins, is the second book in the Hunger Games series. It is just as thrilling, captivating and magical as the first book, but also suffers slightly from being repetitive. Katniss and Peeta are returning home from their Hunger Games victory as the novel opens. They then embark on a tour of all the regions, where their victory is celebrated. But, conflict brews. Katniss struggles with the charade of being in love with Peeta while she still has feelings for Gale. Katniss is even more threatened by President Snow. Katniss's actions at the end of the first book defied Panem and the Capitol, and President Snow promises she will suffer. I don't want to reveal any more of the plot. This book is easily as good as the first. More important, it takes the story into exciting places.<br /><br />Why this book is great: Collins has created sympathetic characters that are put into incredible situations and rise to do heroic acts. The world of Panem is bleak and depressing CATCHING FIRE is really a story of a revolution beginning. Readers might be weary when the last half of the book results in another Hunger Games, but don't fret. It has a great ending and also sets up the final book in the trilogy perfectly.<br /><br />I'm way behind most in reading this series, which is perfect for all ages. A good story is a good story, regardless of the genre or target audience. Books like this don't come along very often, and I'm glad I read it. I can't wait for the movie!

030788743X|5.0|If there's a target demographic for this book, it's people like me. I was a kid in the 1980s and an unrepentant geek who loved video games, sci-fi and fantasy novels, movies, and graphic novels. Not only that, but I became a professional videogame developer as an adult.  I was skeptical that a story centered around 80s pop culture would be anything but gimmicky. And don't get me wrong, it *is* gimmicky -- however, Ready Player One is also delightful, with endearing characters, a believably alive virtual reality world, and sinister corporate bad guys. Like one of those underdog-nerd-against-the-world 80s movies, with its thrills, setbacks, and montage-ready sequences, it calls for a big bowl of buttery popcorn. One the quest to solve billionaire James Halliday's final challenge got underway, I was hooked.  You probably *won't* have fun if you aren't a geek or if you belong to my parents' generation. This book's a love letter for Gen-X readers who grew up with Star Wars, anime, Firefly, Atari, dial-up modems, cyberpunk, the band Rush, Zork, and John Hughes movies -- and for younger ones who grew up with chat rooms, World of Warcraft, and online friendships, but feel a connection to their geek heritage.  The novel's not all sugary confection. There's something plausible and frightening about Cline's grim vision of the future (energy crisis, perma-Recession, corporate indenturement), which is what gives the idea of a global obsession with shiny escapist worlds, including those from a happier past, a touch of earnest meaning. The way the world's going now, I would be surprised if people in 2044 *didn't* live their lives inside something like OASIS. While I don't imagine that pre-millenial pop culture will be too many people's fixation, surely some of it will still be informing whatever does exist.  This might be one of those books that requires the audio version for the full experience. Will Wheaton's fanboyish exuberance is a perfect fit for the protagonist (and this might be the first time I've heard an audiobook narrator get to read a line referring to himself -- as an important political figure of the future, nonetheless).  Absolutely my favorite piece of pleasure reading this year.

0393061310|4.0|Why are some human societies more advanced than others? It's a question that, well into the 20th century, was most often answered in racist terms. Naturally, it was thought, some people developed better technology than others because they were smarter. Diamond tears into such assumptions, making a persuasive case that human technological and cultural advancement have little to do with comparative intelligence, and lot to do with local conditions that put some cultures (or at least their neighbors) on a technological pathway a lot earlier than others. Diamond traces the ultimate keys for the shift from pre-modern to modern back to the areas of agriculture and animal domestication, which, as he explains, would have unlocked a succession of other innovations in centuries to follow. For people who ended a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and settled down, the mere fact of one being in one place would have led to a host of other possibilities, such as increased tool use, the development of plant and animal husbandry, the specialization of jobs and religion, the centralization of government and the rise of an administrative class, the development of language, etc, etc.  Diamond explains in (sometimes boring) detail the many disadvantages that the continents of Africa, Australia, and the two Americas had as places for civilization to develop, such as a lack of domesticable flora and fauna, a difficulty in transferring lifestyles between north-south climate zones, and a lack of suitable geography. He points out cases in which African, American, and Australasian cultures progressed as far as was achievable for anyone in their circumstances, and observes that Europe's disunity compared to China was actually an asset, though China had had a more advanced civilization and had given Europe a number of innovations, as did the Middle East. Then, of course, there is the all-important germs factor -- Europeans in their urban centers were exposed to a variety of pathogens, which were so instrumental in the decimation of New World Indians.  I'm aware that books like Diamonds' are challenged by works such as the Bell Curve, which seek to explain the relative accomplishments of different groups of people in terms of genes. Here's my take on that: yes, genes probably do play *some* role, but, to me, Diamond's insights simply have a lot more explanatory power than Herrnstein and Murray's do. When a human society encounters new difficulties or advantages in its environment, it's *vastly* more likely that the society will evolve, since this is the path of least resistance, than it is that human genes will evolve. Likewise, societal structures pose a much more obvious obstacle to human progress than genes do. Of course, this doesn't mean that genes don't evolve, whenever there is some sort of acute pressure, just that we need to be cautious about what we attribute to them. Historic legacy is incredibly important, and relatively minor developments can have huge consequences generations down the road, in ways that aren't obvious to the average modern person focused only on what he or she can see right now.  I consider GGS an important work because it goes all the way back to human prehistory in establishing the chain of causes that brought about modern civilization, providing many compelling, illustrative refutations of the \\"genes are destiny\\" hypothesis. Yes, as some readers have complained, it's true that Diamond favors the distant past and glosses over a lot significant developments in more modern times. However, I don't think that really matters. GGS is a book about ultimate causes, not secondary ones. That is, it seeks to explain what the recently dominant societies of the world have in common in their long-term past, not the specific reasons that specific countries are the dominant geopolitical players at this specific instant in history. If you want insight into that question (or just want to hear someone credit all that is right in the world to your ownchosen values), go read more books! But, I think that whatever those authors have to say, their arguments will be refinements to the intuitive truth of Diamond's ultimate causes. In my opinion, there's a good reason that the phrase \\"guns, germs, and steel\\" is now part of the public consciousness.  On the audiobook experience: yes, unfortunately, the reader is really dry, even by my forgiving standards.

0763644765|5.0|This book has very short reading which is good for young children.  I bought this book as a xmas gift for my 14 month old neice since that time is soon aproaching.  I will have to get more of the leslie patricelli books.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|To experts and critics I say, I may not know what's good, but I know what I like.  When searching for new music, satelite radio isn't much help.  I wouldn't last 5 minutes listening to top 40 commercial radio, so I turned to friends who do listen.  Those who know my tastes recommended I give Adele a listen, and I really enjoyed her.  In my case, I clearly preferred \\"21\\" to \\"18\\"(?).  I'm looking forward to following this artist and hope that her work continues to appeal.
0062103377|4.0|I thought this book was really cool. It's not only a fun read but it's also informative and has great page turning moments. There's good usage of the Singer vocabulary and when one reads the book you can hear the gruff Singer voice narrarating. He takes you thru stories about his life, the Winchesters and other hunters while implementing some lure on Supernatural creatures. So grab some \\"Rotgut\\" kick back and enjoy the guide

1451648537|5.0|I feel sorry for the (at present) 32 individuals who gave this book one star.  I don't know if they're jealous, ignorant, or just plane stupid -- what Steve Jobs himself might have referred to as \\"bozos.\\" This is an exceptional book and extraordinary biography.  It's also an emotionally-charged reading experience for anyone with an ounce of compassion.  Steve Jobs was a complicated man.  But what made him complicated differs markedly from other men possessing  such rare gifts.  His magnificent mind was complemented by a prickly (dare I say pathological) personality -- one that saw the world in terms of angels and demons possessing the capacity to mutate from one to the other.  But this is really beside the point. The more interesting point is that Steve Jobs was the quintessential un-politician.  Why do I say this? Because he cared not a wit about whether people liked him.  This trait, perhaps, more even more than his unequivocal aesthetic genius and visionary insight is what truly distinguishes him from other industrial stalwarts.  For Jobs it was never/always personal.  Not in terms of likes or dislikes but rather in terms of right and wrong.  Jobs had no brief for light weights or compromises.  He liked to win.  Not for himself but for Apple. And when he won, which was often, he bequeathed to all of us an extraordinary array of brilliant products, brilliant movies, and brilliant design.  As is always the case great men, this will hardly only be the only biography of Steve Jobs.  More will come. Some in this generation. Some in the next.  And some beyond.  This fact alone is a tribute to Steve's Jobs legacy despite his untimely and unfortunate passing.  But what Issacson has done is  in this remarkable book is truly extraordinary.  Having interviewed everyone who was anyone in Steve Jobs' life (friends, foes, lovers, rivals, you name it), he has created a remarkably personal portrait -- one that brought me to tears on more occasions than I care to recount (e.g., when he asked Yo Yo Ma if could play at his funeral) . It's one thing to read a touching (and at times, not so touching portrait of Franklin or Einstein); quite another to read one of a man who has only recently passed and yet whom I am reminded of every time I strike the keys on my Macbook Pro (as I am at the current moment) or touch the screen of my remarkable iPhone without which I could no longer function.  I miss Steve Job though I never knew him.  I mourn for his untimely loss.  I can't say the same about those who passed decades ago.  And I can't ever imagine holding similar thoughts for political leaders and celebrities -- with no disrespect to Michael Jackson.  One final comment. As tempting as it is to focus on Steve Job's less than savory personal attributes, I was overwhelmed by the number of individuals -- many of them corporate titans in their own right -- who apparently dropped almost everything to support Steve Jobs and his family in their time of need.  In the case of Steve Jobs, the number of such individuals is myriad.  I put Mr. Issacson among them.  Such loyalty, admiration, and respect were neither products of Job's fame nor fortune but were instead, I suspect, reflections of this extraordinary individual's genius, passion, and love (there is not other word) for things beautiful.  We have lost a great artist who happened to change our world for the better.  I am sad but privileged to have been contemporary.

This is my second Marware case (the other is for my K4 [[ASIN:B005HSG446 Marware Eco-Vue for Kindle and Kindle Touch Cover, Black]]) and I am pleased with the quality from this company.
1609611543|5.0|This diet is a must- read for anyone trying to lower their A1C levels or lose weight or just feel better. My husband who is a adult-onset diabetic and heart patient has seen amazing results in all these things.  I have followed many diet plans in my 52 years as a type 1 diabetic and have seen great results in lowering my blood sugar levels and the amounts needed for injectable insulin by just eliminating the wheat.  Furthermore, we have both lost weight and feel great.  Cravings have disappeared and belly size has gone down.  Try it, I think you will be amazed at how well this works.  Great information.  I wish I had found out about this years ago but am glad I took time to order the book and get started on it now.
B00275EGWY|5.0|I can't believe people are giving this film such low ratings - probably one of the best films I've ever seen.  But a lot of it has to do with the fact that I could really relate to the lead character in the film and in so many ways I'm a lot like this guy - and everyone wonders why I do the things I do..  if there was ever a movie which struck a nerve in me it was this one - the scene that really got me was the one where he had his collection of all the things that nearly killed him  - and his wedding ring was in there.  Man..   It's like I could totally relate.  And this guy seemed like a big kid and he really didn't know that you couldn't trust everybody and that the kid you think is ok could be the guy trying to kill you the next day.    great movie and I plan on seeing it again.

076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie was a fabulous book that I was able to learn so many life lessons from.  The story is about a teacher, Morrie, who made an impact on so many lives through his optimistic perspective that he had showed in every difficult time he faced in life.  He truly made a difference on one man's life that visited him each week of Morrie's last days on this earth.    Something great I took from this novel is that my time here is short and I must not take it lightly.  I must do all that I can to spend every minute enjoying what I am doing.  A great point that was made was to not revolve your life around money.  Do not do what you hate because it pays well.  It is better for the soul for someone to be paid less and enjoy their time at work.    This book is extremely inspiring and I recommend it to all.  I think that it is a great book that a family can read together.  The reading is not too difficult, but not too easy. It is the perfect book to read when you have a few extra hours for a couple of days.  I loved the experience I gained through reading this novel.  It changed my life perspective dramatically.
B004G600A4|5.0|Everyone in our family loves this movie!  Entertaining for the kids and entertaining for us adults.  Some really funny parts.  Other reviewers have gone into detail, so I'll save everyone an in depth review from me.  Just wanted to share how much we love this flick!
B004LUS390|1.0|...looks like it would be a great app, but way too many force closes on Droid X2 (Android v. 2.3.4).  Did anyone at &quot;the desk&quot; test this or was this app pushed out like R13?
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Amazing quality! I loved it. I think technically is beautifully done. I know some people say that the plot is sloppy and it could have been better, specially if you haven't played the game, maybe it true, but I haven't played the game and understood it just fine. I wasn't expecting Oscar version of the script anyway. I will give it 5* because of it's graphics and visuals.
B005DOKK7Q|2.0|As others have mentioned, this cover smells horrible! It fits a little too snug and only unzips on two sides. The egg crate looking padding leaves much to be desired. Definitely not worth $30! Don't waste your money.
B003M8NGM6|3.0|A sequel that ups the philosophy and the action while also upping the potholes and general ridiculousness, Reloaded can be enjoyed two ways:  The first is to just immerse yourself in the gun fights and kung fu as a mindless popcorn flick. The problem with this is for some of the scenes, the CG effects have not aged well. In these instances you are taken out of the film and feel like your watching a video game.  The second is to listen the the over abundance of philosophy regarding, primarily, probability and fate. The problem here is these ideas are a bit deeper then the movie is willing to go into, so instead it makes the characters talk fast so the audience has to work just to keep up with the dialogue.  This is not to say Reloaded is a bad movie. In fact, there are a few scenes that work exceptionally well for both sides, in particular the weapons fight scene at Merovingian's club (which still looks good) and, without spoiling too much, the conversation Neo has in the TV room (a wonderful visual metaphor).   The two weakest aspects of the film are undoubtedly the beginning and the end. The Zion rave is ridiculous and silly, as is the ending discovered power(s). Still, reloaded isn't terrible. It actually stands up remarkably well and is defiantly worth a watch. Just don't expect the first Matrix.  (PS, I'd give it 3 1/2 stars, but amazon won't let me)
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I just finished this book (not on my Kindle, there are just some books you have to hold in your hands and smell the ink) and I loved it! It makes you want to live in that era (if you didn't to begin with) but in the next chapter you are glad that you were born later. It gets you involved with the characters so much that you can feel their happiness and their pain. A great read!
B0035V35PI|2.0|Ninja Assassin starts out with a bunch of Asian yakuza who inexplicably speak English getting slaughtered by an identityless ninja assassin (!). The sequence contains a pseudo dangling cause/ foreshadowing of an old mans heart in the wrong side of his body along with plenty of computer generated and obnoxiously unrealistic violence. The sequence is never explained or brought up again. What is the point of it? Actually, the point is a very true look at what's in store for the viewer. It's exactly what the rest of the film is going to be like, and it works as a sample to help you decide if you want to continue watching. If you do watch, you'll get more undeveloped and boring characters, more rarely funny humor, more bad acting, and more CG gore.   Raizo, played by pop sensation Rain (not the Mortal Kombat character), is the same exact cookie cutter silent and deadly protagonist any viewer of martial arts films is likely to recognize. The only difference with him is...... his weapon, I guess. He uses the same techniques he learned from \\"the bad guys\\" against them. His experience with learning \\"the bad guys\\" technique is shown to us with multiple cliche flashbacks. I refer to the ninjas as \\"the bad guys\\" since that's all we ever really learn about them. They are bad. I've always felt it should be the bad guy who has the most interesting character. When they don't have any character at all, the film becomes much less engaging. Along with the main Raizo vs \\"the bad guys\\" plot there are also two small subplots. One concerns a Berlin agent Mika (who also inexplicably speaks English ...) that only really acts as a way for the film to add more exposition and plot devices. The other is a romance subplot between Raizo and fellow clan member Kiriko. It acts as yet another overused plot devise for revenge, but it also introduces a pretty large plot hole in the process. How the hell did Kiriko manage to last as long as she did in the clan and still remain so sweet? She must have been put through the same grueling, disgusting, and identity erasing process as everyone else, so how is she still so innocent? Just saying \\"because\\" isn't a good enough answer.  The one thing Ninja Assassins does do right is the action scenes, all of which are pretty well choreographed and fun to watch. Of course, the ultimate outcome of each fight is easy to assume (Spoiler: the good guy wins) and sometimes the film will cheat in order to accomplish this, but the fights are still enjoyable. It is not, however, worth sitting through a 99 minute film that feels twice as long to see the handful of well done fights.
B004LZRSDM|5.0|I saw A-Ha live twice in Brussels, once in 2009 in a more intimate concert and once in 2010 for their final concert in Belgium: they sounded great on both occasions, I couldn't believe how good they were even if I was a long time fan.  Of course, I bought this DVD the day it came out, and am not at all disappointed: sound and image are both excellent. I consider it my best music dvd, together with....Live at Vallhall by.... A-HA !
B005IZLPMY|4.0|If ever you needed proof that Chris Evans can act as someone other then a douche, this movie is it. Captain America may not have the most complex characters in it, but the focus on Rodgers as a good guy rather then Captain America as a hero for the first part of the film feels heart felt and true. Having an under dog with a heart of gold isn't anything original, but this film isn't going for unique and gritty like many modern comic adaptations are. As for how everyone else does in their roles, there really isn't a stinker in the entire cast. Hayley Atwell is gorgeous and doesn't overdue the \\"girl power\\" thing, though I'm getting tired of the forced love interest in Marvel movies. Sebastien Stan plays a pretty serious and much more mature Bucky then I was expecting (honestly, who thought Bucky would even be in this movie?). Dominic Cooper's Stark has just enough Downey Jr in it to feel the connection, but not so much it feels like a rip off. As for Hugo Weaving, he does a great job with what he has, but not much of the run time is spent developing his character which is slightly disappointing. Most of the exposition on Red Skull is given through dialogue to Rogers, so we aren't given much to find interesting about his personality. Then again, it's a character named \\"The Red Skull\\", some one so bad even the Nazis think he's evil. Is there anything else you need to know?  The visual effects are varied, with some being phenomenal (The weakening of Evans looks very convincing) to pretty horrendous ( much of the Cg movement (I.E the train scene) looks videogame-ey and fake). The costume designs work with what the source material gives, and the way they integrate Captain America's costume is pure genius. That goes for the campiness of the original comics as well. The movie never parodies it completely, but works it into the plot to push the action forward. All I'll say is Captain America does hit Hitler, sort of, and it's awesome.  Finally, there is the action of the filmto talk about. It encompasses a good part of the latter half of the film. The fight choreography is fine, as you'd expect from a comic movie, with some fun and unique uses of the shield. The amount of violence can be a bit surprising, as we see bullet holes rip though Hydra bodies and one man gets thrown into a propeller. It's nothing that will make you grabbing for the vomit bag, but it still feels a bit out of place in a film where the main character is so opposed to killing. Over all the action is well shot an engaging.  Captain America ends up being a slight bit better then Thor, not quite as good as Iron Man, and totally worth watching.
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|I didn't think it was possible, but this movie just got better.  1080p picture is amazing and makes viewing much better.  they don't make horror movies like they used to and this classic looks great in blu ray!!!!
B0025KVLU6|3.0|All of the songs are either hit or miss. While My Guitar Gently Weeps is one of their best songs and possibly my favorite Beatles song of all time. Everyone's Got Something To Hide Except Me And My Monkey, Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill, Piggies and Ob-la-Di, Ob-la-Da are some of their songs that I could live without. The Beatles are talented but not when they write songs that anyone could make up like Ob-la-Di Ob-la-Da or other various tracks with no point to them. However the entire album isn't bad and there are some excellent songs like Back In the USSR, Dear Prudence, Glass Onion, Sexy Sadie, Helter Sketer, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Birthday and Revolution. It's got a good diversity ranging from hard rock to acoustic ballads and it's worth owning but it's far from a masterpiece let alone The Beatles best due to the inconsistency throughout.
0345529057|5.0|I, like many people recently, found out about this series after watching the HBO tv series A Game of Thrones. When I saw that this boxed set of the first four books was on sale for less than $20 with free shipping I bought it immediately. The package arrived within two days and was exactly as ordered. So thumbs up to the seller there.  As for the quality of the books, I found the first three book thoroughly entertaining and engrossing. I became especially addicted to the interwoven storylines while reading A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords. One criticism that I have of the series is that events drag on and Martin regularly leaves his audience hanging. This happens a lot in A Clash of Kings, but most of those things are addressed with some devastating resolutions in A Storm of Swords. However, in A Feast for Crows Martin stepped away from the storylines of Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen just as they seem poised to come to the forefront. Instead, he forces the audience to read about some tangentially related characters who are now, apparently, important parts of the central storyline. This is fine, except for the fact that, again, the audience is left wondering how it's all supposed to end for twice as many characters now than at the end of A Storm of Swords.  However unfulfilling A Feast for Crows ends, though, the series is well worth the $20 I paid for it. I definitely got my money's worth after calculating the cost per page.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|1997 was the last time they did a studio album, it was their self-titled follow up to their 1994 debut Dummy. Both of those albums are masterpieces and great trip-hop/electronic albums. In the early '00s, Beth Gibbons made a side project \\"Beth Gibbons and Rustin Man\\" and they had their debut \\"Out of Season\\" which was released in '02 but now Portishead are back. Third has a more updated, modern sound to it. Less experimental and the trip-hop influences are mostly gone. Third is more electronic with some industrial influences and it's more rock. It's not as good as their first 2 but Third is still amazing and in my top 5 albums of 2008. My highlights are The Rip, Machine Gun and Silence but they're all good.
B000244FDW|5.0|I first saw this mini-series on netflix. I personally favour British television shows and movies, for I find it much less graphic, more realistic, and with an incredible touch of class which American television does not possess. The older shows on BBC particularly. I have watched this series several times.   Jane Austin's characaters are most proper. A very gentle, exilarating show indeed.

B005HSG3TC|2.0|The cover fits well, it's pretty light, and seems to offer reasonable protection.  Unfortunately the folding cover is useless as a stand; it just doesn't work at all. The edge of the cover is barely held by the groove in the cover, and it collapses at the slightest provocation.  Even at the now reduced price it seems a lot of money for what it is.
B004LUS390|5.0|I've been waiting for this to be the FAOTD forever since I downloaded the Free version. It doesn't get much better than this for drawing on a phone. Lots of features too.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|This is a nice case, I have to say I think it is sturdy and should last.  But I am disappointed that there is no strap on in to help you hold it while you are using the device.  The Fire is a little thick and heavy and after trying to hold it in one hand, that hand and wrist gets tired grasping the device.  The elastic band that is on this device is probably only intended to keep the cover opened or closed.  It is too loose to be able to slip your hand through that band and use it for support.  It is also on the right side of the device so it is a little too far away to hold onto.  I would like a stronger elastic band and preferbably in the center of the case.  I know the case doesn't say that it has a handle, but I am still giving it only 2 stars because I think for this device you really do need a strap handle in order to use the device comfortably.

031617615X|3.0|I admit the first time I read this series, I read it like I was addicted, nonstop late late nights, waking up early so I could keep reading. Finished the first three books within a few days(I am surprised I took the time to eat :) ). So when this book came out I couldn't wait to dive into it.<br /><br />And though I did like this book, I am not sure its my favorite. I think I would have preferred to be all in Bella's point of view. Not that I didn't enjoy seeing Jacob's side(I love Jacob as a whole but if it were to be another point a view I would like maybe to have been Edward's).<br /><br />I am not sure I connected with this book as I had with the others, and I am sad because I am not sure why either. Maybe it was the switch of points of view I dunno.<br /><br />One think I can say about this book and the series overall is that it was read by a diverse of people as well I was able to get a nonreader to become a fan of reading. I personally found a new genre to love and not be embarrassed to read it and that is Young Adult.<br /><br />Source: My own copy
0525423656|4.0|I started reading this trilogy with the hopes of finding a second Hunger Games. While many of the same themes are present, I was not all that enthralled with Matched. I found the story a bit weak and had a hard time understanding Cassia's actions which I didn't think were fleshed out enough. However, this second installment is much stronger and more exciting to read. The narration changes from simply Cassia's perspective to alternating chapters in both her and Ky's minds. At first, I thought it was a drastic decision for an author to change the narration style like this, but in the end I enjoyed witnessing word characters' thought processes. It made me feel for each of them and understand their struggles better. I feel Condie introduced more interesting twists in this one, particularly with regard to Xander. It feels as if Cassia is being set up to have to make another decision by the end of the trilogy which I think would be interesting. The book ends on somewhat of an ambiguous note. I wasn't exactly dying to know what happens next, however, I am interested to see how the series will wrap up.

B004LZEV4Q|4.0|I raised my three children on Margaret Wise Brown's \\"Goodnight Moon\\" - my husband and I can still recite the whole book by heart... I have given it as a gift at more baby showers than I can count - including to my daughter and my daughter-in-law and I have been lucky enough to read it to my grandchildren.  Now that we are living hundreds of miles apart from these beloved grandchildren, I rarely have the luxury of reading them \\"Goodnight Moon\\" at bedtime, so I thought I would give the recordable books a try.  I was very happy with the ease of recording (it helped that this is a short, simple book) and now my babies can have Nana read them a bedtime story whenever they want.  I definitely recommend this version as a good addition to a child's library.
0307454541|5.0|I only picked this book up because of all the hype associated with it, but it really wasn't what I expected at all. First off, I think the translator(s) deserve applause for the excellent job they've done here. The language is great. I don't know what the tone of the original was, but the narrator's voice in this is rather formal (i.e. no contractions etc.).<br /><br />The characters are wonderful, and the girl is my new hero!<br /><br />It does get a bit nasty in places, but it's never gratuitous. Such a shame Mr Larsson is no longer here to enjoy his fame.<br /><br />I cannot wait to read the next one!!!!
B005DKLPF6|3.0|This is a pretty weak album.  The second half gets nice and heavy,   but the first half sounds like pop rock radio crap.  As usual, there aren't enough catchy lyrics,  and riffs are few and far between, really.  When the band does get its riff on, well, its very good.  I'm looking for another album from these guys  that has 1 song that compares with the song \\"Blood and Thunder\\" from their \\"Leviathan\\" album.  I need to hear just 1 more song of that quality!  After 3 listens, I wish I had spent my money on something else.  All you can hear is drums, drums, drums, and effects.  Most of the guitars are strumming, and you can't tell what the bass guitar is doing, and the vocals are just hazy and unclear, which is a real pitty, because the lyrics are very very interesting.  I like the spacey effects.  The one great thing this album has going is a Voivod feel, like you are floating in space.  They have my admiration.   I want to see them live again.  Seeing this stuff played live is something else altogether.  I think Baroness and Bison B.C take everything that Mastodon is trying to do, and do it much better, but Mastodon make it look good.

B004HO6I2E|5.0|Are ya'll kidding me? How anyone could not like this movie is beyond me. I loved it! It's a great change of pace to have 2 men switch bodies. These are two of my favorite actors and at first I wasn't expecting much when I first started watching but there were times I literally burst out LOL! C'mon this is a classic \\"chick flick\\" and if it weren't for the full $19.99 price on it I would buy it today. I will definitely be purchasing this one to add to my movie collection as soon as the price drops on it. Ryan Reynold's and Jason Bateman did a terrific job switching roles (especially in the beginning). I liked Olivia Wilde from watching House, M.D. and she did a good job in this as well. Fun comedy with some really funny scenes. Love it & highly recommend it!

0439023521|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. There's strong characterization, the plot moves at just the right place, and you can really immerse yourself in the story.
B002BWP49M|4.0|I just saw the movie this evening. I enjoyed it. It is not Oscar material. If you like the book, you are in for a good film. I stayed through the credits and there is a scene that sets up Breaking Dawn Part 2.  Sit and watch. It is interesting.
B00005JO20|4.0|At 188 minutes, this version of the 1933 classic movie is good for the most part. Though Kong doesn't appear until an hour and ten minutes into the film, the viewer isn't getting restless, because they know that he will be the focus of the remainder of the film. This movie starts a bit slow (obviously), but the first hour isn't exactly wasted, as time is spent on character development, especially with Ann Darrow. We're taken into her world as an actress, and how she's pursued for her role. Naomi Watts does a superb job as Ann, and her compassion for Kong is heartfelt and real. If this movie has some weak spots, it's simply the length of it, along with too much emphasis on CGI capabilities. Some of the CGI sequences are over the top, and to the point of not looking real, whether it be too many closeups, too much ground-level stuff, or unusual athletic ability. Certain sequences are wonderful, such as the T Rex fight, and Kong's rampage through the city streets. All in all, this film is still good, and kept my attention throughout. However, I needed a break after the first half; it seems to work well that way.
B005HSG3U6|2.0|[[ASIN:B005HSG3U6 Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Cover by Marware, White]]  I received my Kindle Fire on Nov. 15 and two Kindle Fire covers on Nov. 17.  Was intending to keep both covers,  but I returned this one as soon as UPS showed up at my door with the second cover - handed the driver the return package containing Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Cover by Marware.  I really love Marware products.  I have two camera cases, one pda case and a Compaq 1000 laptop case made by Marware - all very good.  This case had many problems.  First, getting the Kindle Fire snapped in or out was a mighty chore making me think I might break my Kindle after a few repeats of the procedure.  Second, the case was lightweight (great), but made of very cheap plastic with sharp edges (bad).  Third,  the \\"stand\\" simply did not work properly and the Kindle would fall backwards on my living room cocktail table with a thunk.  I DID keep the second cover which was a Marware jurni Kindle Fire Cover in red and it is awesome and worth every penny. (AT the time it was $10 cheaper than the Microshell - go figure).
B000TBGGOE|5.0|Great Album. I couldn't have asked for it in better condition than it is. it plays beautifully and im very satisfied.
B005JZBP8W|1.0|I was suspicious from the beginning that a film of this import was being slipped onto the blu-ray market with little to no fanfare.  I read the other reviews on Amazon criticizing the transfer from the restored 1994 DVD, and dismissed the manufacturing complaints (blurred, foggy picture around the edges) as probably owing to faulty equipment.  I was foolish. The disc is a mess.<br /><br />From the moment the credits begin to roll, it is apparent something is not right.  The gorgeous background flowers are grainy and in questionable focus, and there is indeed fog around the edge of the picture in the opening outdoor scenes.  Then the fog follows the action indoors and never leaves.<br /><br />Every once in a while there is a scene without fog and in crystal clear resolution.  Those moments are dazzling, and it makes you realize what the film might have looked like.  But it is very apparent that not only are there serious transfer issues with the disc, but also serious manufacturing problems as well.<br /><br />Stay AWAY from this blu-ray, and complain bitterly to CBS for their shoddy work on this less than fair lady!!!
B000056NX5|1.0|THIS WOULD NOT BE A BAD PLAY AT ALL BUT THERESE ONE MAJOR FLAW!!!!MOST OF THE ACTORS CANT SING!!!!I WASNT IMPRESSED WITH JESUS SINGING VOICE AND SOME OF THE OTTHER ACTORS THERE VOICES ARE JUST PLAIN HORRIBALE!!!!I WOULD THINK BEING ABLE TO SING WOULD BE THE MAIN REQIREMENT TO GET A PART IN THIS PLAY WAS THE CASTING DIRECTOR DRUNK!!!!
B0036B4ETS|5.0|My teenage daughter needed a longer lasting battery for her Sony Camcorder.  The Department store prices seemed high so I checked Amazon.com.  This battery, Sony NP-FV70, was 2 1/2 times as large as the original battery and INCLUDING shipping was $19.00 LESS than the department store's price.  The battery has charged well and holds it's charge well.  She now has five hours of vidio time instead of two.  Shipping time was great.  The daughter is happy, now dad is happy.

B005W3G2D4|4.0|'Stronger,' Kelly Clarkson's fifth album, shoots for stars without gathering much debris. Less varied, but far more consistent than 'My December,' Kelly continues her way back to the top of the charts in the same fluid fashion she reignited with 'All I Ever Wanted,' (a mere stepping stone compared to this one). Her new songs are hit radio ready with hardly a dud in the bunch, but nothing matches the best songs of 'Breakaway,' her best album to date.  'Stronger' works best when the songs are layered more intricately with lyrics that are interesting enough to match her music.  \\"Hello\\" and \\"Dark Side,\\" arguably the two best songs on the C.D., demonstrate that her return to form is artistic and not merely commercial.  \\"Standing in Front of You\\" is indeed slick, but her sweetness showcases that Kelly has more to offer than fast-forward, car-ready, dance class hits.    Most of the subject matter is familiar. Strife and division still wound her heart, whether she has co-penned the song or not.  However, this time Kelly has more to sing about than her boyfriend's shortcomings.  Articulately, she expresses the pitfalls of social expectations in \\"You Can't Win,\\" and the aforementioned \\"Dark Side\\" does self-finger pointing for a Personals' Ad confessional like few songs since Cheryl Crow's \\"Strong Enough\\". \\"I Forgive You\\" isn't as emotional or stimulating as \\"Because of You,\\" but it does the trick for variety.   There is some irony to go with the release.  The first two songs, \\"Mr. Know It All\\" and \\"(What Doesn't Kill You) Stronger\\" may be the prime movers as singles, but \\"You Love Me,\\" \\"The War Is Over,\\" and \\"Breaking Your Own Heart\\" are better overall.  \\"Einstein,\\" perhaps the album's weakest track, is oddly simplistic.  The title is perfect.  While on the road to recovery since 'My December,' Kelly Clarkson has found herself and her voice for a 'Stronger'  showing and the second best c.d. of her career.
B004LROMSO|5.0|Although not quite as graphic in terms of gore and nudity as [[ASIN:B003PIUBZS Spartacus: Blood and Sand - The Complete First Season]], Camelot is once again an epic adult soap opera.The writing is again above the usual level of series TV. The tone is adult closer to [[ASIN:B000Q66JXA Excalibur [Blu-ray]]] or [[ASIN:B00005QW5Y The Mists of Avalon]] than say [[ASIN:B00004R9A0 The Sword in the Stone (Disney Gold Classic Collection)]] or the recent [[ASIN:B001LF347E Merlin: The Complete First Season]] It's also not [[ASIN:B0045HCJ6M Camelot (Special Edition)]] the Musical.   What it is, is an original reinterpretation of the legendary tale.Recommended!
B00436GNVC|3.0|This CD is not as strong as the first and very disappointing to say the least.  I understand she fired most of her original studio crew, band and manager. What was she thinking.  Someone has influenced her style and just made it very disappointing to me especially the more modern upbeat songs.  What's up with that?  Those type seem to have a disappointing new flavor that wonders what's going to come out next.  I don't know who these people are that change what is already good but they need to listen to the fans.  I believe the same thing has happened to Jewel.  While some songs are good on this CD I only rate it as average.
B005FITIMS|5.0|Certainly Pedro Almodovar is like no other movie maker on earth. I swear that you can pick his films out of a movie lineup. There is usually the sexual overlay, sometimes more obvious than at other times. Some of the women characters look as if they may not have been born women. On the other hand, some of the women are frightening beautiful (Elena Anaya as Vera is this film). And even in Almodor's most serious films, there is an element of comedy. (As in this movie, only a mother can identify her masked son by seeing his naked butt!)<br /><br />We can all rejoice to see that Antonio Banderas, whom I believe Almodovar may have discovered, is aging well. His understated ice-cold portrayal of a scientist set on revenge-- which is always best if rendered up cold-- is quite wonderful.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"The Skin I Live In\\" is one of those movies that you cannot describe in detail or you will do a tremendous disservice to anyone wanting to see it. If you like Senor Almodovar, however, or if you want to see a film not like anything else you'll see this year, then you should quietly slip into your local theatre. You are in for both a visual treat and a plot that will keep you wide awake!
B003JTHXN6|4.0|Man, I wanted to give this book five stars, but the author's writing style is just too annoying for me to do that.  This book has some great nuggets, and if you're in a position to change your organization's focus, there are some things you'll want to take from this book.  Tony's story is inspiring, but the cute little stories he tells about his cheildhood almost make you want to close the book before you get to the good parts.  The emails and letters from employees were also a little much, but I guess it just adds to the total package and gives an honest accounting of the way things are at Zapps, so i can't blem Hsieh for using them.  I'd recommend this book for sure.
B004ZH66XO|5.0|My son loves it.  If it had new level updates or seasons like angry birds it would be super.  But it is great.
B004132HZS|5.0|3 amazing, and quite long episodes of a new modern version of Sherlock. Cumberbatch and Freeman make the perfect team in these thrilling mysteries. Sherlock's ignorance of appropriate social behaviors is compensated for his great mind. If you love British TV you'll love Sherlock. Especially in a 21st century setting. You'll be begging for another episode! Great! Allow about 1.5 hours for each episode. Enjoy.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|good app.  One of the best free apps of the day so far. Easy for my pre schooler to operate.

B000TDIE9C|3.0|As a stand-alone Beach Boys album, Smiley Smile is by no means terrible. Prior to Pet Sounds, Beach Boys albums were hit-and-miss affairs anyway - typically a collection of great singles and some decent but often mediocre filler. The reason Smiley Smile is so maligned is because by 1967 we had been conditioned to expect so much more from Brian Wilson and company. Even if Brian's grandiose vision for 'Smile' would never be realized, what we have here apart from the 1966 single 'Good Vibrations' and a severely edited version of 'Heroes and Villains' is a puzzling hodge podge of misguided attempts at comedy ('She's Goin' Bald'), lame Smile re-recordings ('Wonderful' and 'Wind Chimes') and underwhelming new material ('Gettin' Hungry', 'Little Pad'). Wild Honey has been categorized as a 'soul' album, perhaps because The Beach Boys take a stab at Stevie Wonder's 'I Was Made To Love Her', but most of the tracks sound like demos and could have used a little more care and attention in the studio. As hard as Carl Wilson tries to be a white Otis Redding, it just isn't convincing. Brian was never going to be Dylan, but 'I'd Love Just Once To See You' sounds like he's singing whatever popped into his head at the moment. Again, not an awful album (they would have plenty of those in the 70's and 80's) but it could have been so much better.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I do not understand why this game is so popular. It is not very entertaining at all. Just like every other catapult game out there.
B004KD5TQI|5.0|Great cd! Now while there is some previously released material on this album, don't let that discourage you. The remixes are dead on. Here's my thoughts on each track:<br /><br />1. Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) - 5.0 Emily Brown, what can't she do? Act, and now sing? Yes she does a heck of a job on this song. A classic reworking that hits on all cylinders.<br />2. Army of Me (Sucker Punch Remix) - 4.0 Don't get me wrong, the song fits perfectly in with the movie. And the remix is cool. But not too special. Bjork screams some, and that's about it. Still though it doesn't detract from the rest of the album.<br />3. White Rabbit - 5.0 A song about Alice In Wonderland. It rocks. Emiliana Torrini's voice is perfect here. A dreamy rock/pop song.<br />4. I Want It All/ We Will Rock You (Mash Up) - 1.0 Ugh, this doesn't work with the rest of the cd in my opinion. It's a fist pumping mix of rap and classic Queen. But it sticks out like a sore thumb when compared with the rest of the dreamy rock and punk songs.<br />5. Search and Destroy - 4.5 Ah here we go. Jumps right back into the album's theme. Good song<br />6. Tomorrow Never Comes - 4.0 A very memorable song (on the movie it's the train scene/kitchen scene). This song get's stuck in my head every time I hear it. It is not dying....argh! See!<br />7. Where Is My Mind? - 4.5 Emily Brown sings backup to this song as well. Will stick with you long after the song ends.<br />8. Asleep - 4.0 Yet a third Emily Brown song! And she rocks this one as well. Slower and haunting.<br />9. Love is the Drug - 5.0 This song is from the final credits in the movie. And it fits in so well. Once you get done the movie you are kind of in a dark place by what you have just seen. This song is the perfect touch to bring you back up. It sounds like a big grand production. Great song and a great way to conclude the album.<br /><br />Final Score: 37.0 out of 45.0<br />Not too shabby! With the exception of song number four this soundtrack doesn't miss a beat. I personally recommend it.
1594744769|3.0|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children promises an innovative approach using authentic vintage photography added to the narrative. The photos are interesting and creepy, but most of the time they do not really add anything innovative to the book. Don't get me wrong, not every novel has to be innovative, but these photos are the gimmick that tries to spice up an otherwise bland novel.<br /><br />The use of the photos in Miss Peregrine's home calls to mind the use of photos in other recent novels, Water for Elephants being a good example. The difference between the two is that Water for elephants is a good novel even without them. Miss Peregrine's Home promises paranormal mystery but does not deliver much. The mystery is pretty quickly solved and it isn't very exciting.<br /><br />Much of that can be explained with the fact that it's probably the first installment in a series. A lot of time was taken introducing characters and the basic premise. Will I read a sequel?...I might. It may be worth giving another chance to the series, but as a stand alone novel it's weak and the gimmick it relies on doesn't work very well.<br /><br />Trev [...]
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|The book was an easy quick read but was typical Nicholas Sparks..some parts were a bit hard to believe and I had it figured out before I was a third of the way through it...not one of my favorites..
B001EN71DQ|4.0|It has been a while since I have seen the movies and the ones I have are on vhs tapes.  There are no bonus features on the vhs tapes, so the dvd is a must for them.  The behind the scenes stuff always interests me and commentary.  These are great on this format.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I have had these movies in VHS format but there never was any bonus features on how the movies were made or commentary. It i nice to have the DVD so that I have these. I am one for behind the scenes stuff.  So it is great to have these now in my film library.
B004LUS390|5.0|Great job autodesk.  this is the ultimate painting app for android. Now I need a tablet to enjoy this even more. anyone that gives this a bad rating either has a old phone or doesent understand graphic design much. this is much more than I thought possible from a mobile application. easily worth the small price tag.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I do not know why but I received the UK Box Set (all regions) instead of the US Region A. No complaints at all. Nice package and most important thing: no issues in my PS3.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|For the original $39.99 I expected a quality product... It's not even worth the reduced price of $29.99 as it's just flimsy plastic with marginally effective padding. Disappointing to say the least.
B004CR7TE2|4.0|Nothing stellar but not too shabby although way overpriced in my book.  To me this is actually a mere step up from those basic sleeves for other products like netbooks that are similar to wetsuits...of course, the bonus in this product is that it is semi-rigid.<br /><br />I don't use anything for Apple or Mac but this sleeve has provided my Amazon Kindle and HP Touchpad an extra level of protection and I often use it as a lap pad when I am using the two.  Good quality construction that can do itself a favor by not being Apple centric but again way too overpriced for just being a sleeve, which is what it is.  For reference I am comparing this product to this product (about $8 cheaper at time of review):  [..]
B004XNGKBS|5.0|What it needs is the following:<br /><br />Request for improvement:  Would be great to be able to edit an existing line instead of having to delete it and re-do it.  Still a 5 star app though :)<br /><br />Learn how to use it and it is a great app It has a great setting to allow user to turn off automatic posting so you can take your time to fill up a page - also make your text area that the pen uses bigger - and viola you have a full page to write on to your leisure - including basic drawings.  Also remember to try out the different pen colors :)
B005UDD1R6|3.0|I can attest that this does in fact play audio from the DLNA server in my LaCie NAS.  I have some 80GB of .m4a tracks copied from my iTunes library on the server and they all show up.  It IS flaky in the sense that it can take a very long time to recognize the DLNA server from the \\"My Sources\\" page - that may explain some of the problems other reviewers have mentioned.   in fact, it is SO flaky that after my Kindle went to sleep, I woke it up and it resumed playing the track off the server - even though the server no longer showed up in \\"My Sources\\".    It can take a very long time to download (and cache?) album art from the server.  Most of the time it gives up before getting all the artwork.  It crashes and displays wide variety of anomalous behavior - but, hey, waddaya want for free?
