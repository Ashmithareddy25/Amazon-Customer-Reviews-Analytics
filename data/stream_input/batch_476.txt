B0001MDPV8|5.0|You don't, that's how.  But what you CAN do is add some new remixes and unreleased material that would make the overall package even more enticing.  I already own the original on tape, CD, and vinyl.  I copped this CD mostly out of respect and also to have something to play in the whip because my original CD copy is worn from heavy use.  It's hard to believe that this album came out 11 years ago, but it still sounds just as fresh now as it did then. As far as the remixes go, they could've been better, but they're still dope.  I have better remixes on 12\\" singles and vinyl, but the producers did a good job of refreshing some old material.  Rockwilder does a great job of reworking \\"Life's A B*tch\\".  \\"The World Is Yours\\" remix can be boring if you're not in the mood for it.  I would've preferred the Pete Rock remix.  I didn't feel the Vibesmen work on the boards I guess.  The \\"One Love\\" and \\"It Ain't Hard To Tell\\" remixes are tight.  Nick Fury did \\"One Love\\" some justice and I think that it's the best remix on the entire album.  I also like how Nick Fury incorporated \\"Nobody Beats The Biz\\" into the remix for \\"It Ain't Hard To Tell\\".<br /><br />The two unreleased joints are produced by Marley Marl (On The Real) and Large Professor (Star Wars).  \\"Star Wars\\" would be the stronger of the two, but \\"On The Real\\" is still tight.  It's good to hear Large Professor putting together dope beats again.  His last album was definitely suspect.<br /><br />If I had to find a beef with the second disc, it would be the fact that the lyrics to some of the remixes are censored.  I still haven't figured that one out.  That's a minor complaint though, the album is still fire.  As a whole, I'd have to say that this album is a must have for people that call themselves fans of rap music.
B000001Y42|1.0|What do you call a fat, middle-aged, washed up, untalented hack with a microscopic weenie??? (if you saw that stupid new sex tape, which was pretty gross, you'll know what I mean)...Give up? You call her Fred Durst..Yes I'm aware that i said \\"her\\".  Seriously though....wait...I was being serious...anyway..I'd rather listen to a cat getting electrocuted than this album.  If this is considered their best albums, I don't even want to know what their worst is.  It's not only Fred though, the whole band sucks.  The guitarist sucks, almost every band with a DJ is stupid, and I'm sure the other two suck as well...in conclusion, they all suck, especially Phat Fred...sorry..Fat Fred..OK that was lame..but anyway..yeah this band sucks and avoid this album or any other album by this extremely crappy band.

B00006IU73|5.0|This album is one the best albums ever recorded...yeah, I'm not exaggerating...it's that good.  Every song is magnificent and unique in its own way.  Steven Wilson also has some of the most hauntingly beautiful vocals I've ever heard.  Some of the standout tracks include Blackest Eyes, Trains, Gravity Eyelids (which has a very cool riff in the middle to end of the song), and Heartattack in a Layby.  Do yourself a favor and purchase this album.  You will not be dissapointed.
0060590165|5.0|\\"Lirael\\" is neither the beginning nor the end (thank goodness) of this remarkable fantasy series by Garth Nix.  If you haven't already read \\"Sabriel\\", you might want to put \\"Lirael\\" aside and begin at the beginning.  The middle book could stand alone, especially the story of Lirael herself, but you will miss nuances of the Philosophy and Geography of Death if you don't start with \\"Sabriel\\".  The only work I can compare this series to is Philip Pullman's \\"Golden Compass\\" trilogy, although I prefer Nix's magical world-building.  If I ever die and go to fantasy heaven, I hope it resembles his immense library beneath glacier and mountain, where each door opens into a separate mystery.  In the catacombs beneath the library, Lirael discovers how to turn herself into an ice otter or a barking owl, reads \\"The Book of Remembrance and Forgetting\\", and duels with the monstrous Stilken.<br /><br />However, \\"Lirael\\" isn't just about Lirael.  Prince Sameth, heir apparent to Sabriel as the Old Kingdom's champion against evil necromancers, also comes of age in this volume.  There are plenty of evil necromancers to go around.  In fact, at the end of this book, it appears as though they are winning the war to turn the Old Kingdom into a kingdom of the dead.<br /><br />One fault should be noted. The two main characters spend too much text feeling sorry for themselves.  Lirael pursues an impossible dream, while Prince Sameth tries to escape from an impossible nightmare.  I think the author's editor must have read \\"Sabriel\\" and said, \\"Garth, this is a great fantasy but your heroine, Sabriel is pretty darn self-sufficient.  Readers can't relate to that.  You need to make your characters more vulnerable.\\"  So that's exactly what Nix did in Volume Two.  Vulnerability often shades over into self-pity in \\"Lirael\\"---too often for my liking.  It's not enough of an annoyance to bypass this fantasy.  Hopefully, in the yet-to-be-published \\"Abhorsen\\", Lirael and Prince Sameth will stop whining and take up the burden of defending the Old Kingdom.  Lirael is already headed in that direction, along with her friend the Disreputable Dog.<br /><br />Garth, I advise you to stop listening to your editor.  You were pitch-perfect in \\"Sabriel\\". Retune `Astarael, the Sorrowful' that \\"casts all who hear it deep into Death\\" and finish this marvelous trilogy the way you began it.<br /><br />NOTE:  the 'adult' version has exactly the same text as earlier printings of this book.  Only the cover is different.rden of defending the Old Kingdom.  Lirael is already headed in that direction, along with her friend the Disreputable Dog.

B0002EXH5O|5.0|Wow...what can I say about this album except that it kicks an extroadinary amount of ass.  This, is thrash metal at its finest.  The guitar work is absoloutely amazing (especially on songs such as Hangar 18 and Holy Wars) and Marty Friedman  shreds it up along with Mustaine.  Even though Dave did change the vocals somewhat on the Remastered version, it is still, nonetheless a magnificent album.  This album is an absolute must for all music fans let alone metal fans.
0007137346|5.0|As in \\"Sabriel\\" and \\"Lirael,\\" Death is a riverine chasm from which the dead can be called back to the living by powerful necromancers.  Only the Abhorsen (Sabriel) or the Abhorsen-in-waiting (Lirael) can pass from life into the river of Death, through the eight Gates of fog, whirlpools, waterfalls, and shadow, and do magical combat with the necromancers in their own dark realm...<br /><br />Well, the Disreputable Dog can splash into Death, too and in \\"Abhorsen\\" you'll find out who she really is, along with Mogget the bad-tempered cat (who reminds me of some of the grouchier Jack Lemon characters).<br /><br />\\"Abhorsen\\" is a worthy conclusion to Nix's Old Kingdom trilogy.  Read \\"Sabriel\\" and \\"Lirael\\" before undertaking \\"Abhorsen,\\" so that you can familiarize yourself with the Philosophy and Geography of Death.  Nix isn't into summarization or repetition. He plunges his reader right into a whirlpool of death, animated corpses, and Charter magic.  If you don't already know such characters as the Disreputable Dog, the necromancer Hedge, or his bone-headed companion, Nick, you might never figure out what's going on.<br /><br />This book is a direct continuation of \\"Lirael,\\" with the ex-assistant librarian and her companion, Prince Sameth carrying on the battle against Hedge and the evil he is digging up at Red Lake.  Although Prince Sameth was meant to be the Abhorsen-in-Waiting, heir to the powers of 'The Book of the Dead' and the seven bells, Lirael now takes up that role, and Sam seeks his destiny as a descendant of the mysterious Wallmakers, who built the barrier between the magical Old Kingdom and the mundane kingdom of Ancelstierre.  The two will need all of the magic they can conjure up against an enemy that threatens not only the Charter, but all living beings.<br /><br />The swirl and cross-currents of life gradually ebb as the dead pass through gate after gate on Garth Nix's nameless river--a river like Styx or Lethe that runs through each of our subconscious underworlds as a legacy of our water-bound gestation.  It is an eerie experience to remember that journey of birth--only this time in the wake of the dead--in this marvelous fantasy trilogy.ur subconscious underworlds as a legacy of our water-bound gestation.

B0002EQ7E2|5.0|Thanks, Roger O. Green, for pointing out that there was an extended remix of this brilliant album's first track. <br /> <br />However, it HAS been released on CD! In 1986, there was a 5\\" single in a cardboard sleeve. You can still find it on the internet. <br /> <br />\\"Graceland\\" was the very first CD I ever had, and although I didn't listen to it for some years when I was young, I picked it up again when I was about fifteen, and since then, it's been one of my all-time favourites (and I own over 415 CDs at the moment). \\"Diamonds...\\" still brings tears to my eyes, it's that good. Definitely one of the best albums not only of the 80s, but ever. <br /> <br />Finally, they released a remastered edition of it! I can't wait to get it and turn up \\"You can call me Al\\" or wake up the neighbours with the first seconds of \\"Fingerprints\\" :-)
0790729628|2.0|From the moment that I saw this film in '82 until today, it's remained among my favorites.  For the life of me, however, I cannot understand why the director eliminated the narration from this film. <br /> <br />Many of you may not know this, but there once was a movie genre called FILM NOIRE.  These movies usually involved a really good, loner type detective, like \\"Sam Spade\\" or the like.  He would walk you though the film using narration that highlighted what he was thinking while you watched him perform his investigative duties with a featureless \\"poker face\\" to fool the bad guys.   <br /> <br />Periodically, and most often impersonated, the detective would \\"step out\\" of a scene he was in and talk to the audience instead of narrating over the action.  Perhaps you've seen old Bogart films where he'd stand under a light pole in the rain and recite a monologue to the audience about how he felt the case was going or to highlight another character's actions, behaviors or personalities according to him.  THAT is E X A C T L Y what Blade Runner was meant to depict in a futuristic setting.  It worked WELL, and it is sorely missed from the director's cut. <br /> <br />Honestly, and many will agree, unless you've seen the original cut of this film, you lose a LOT of information that helps you understand the story to the fullest.  If I'm \\"whining\\" or \\"don't understand the `new school' \\" and you DISAGREE blindly, then don't you EVER use the CAST/CREW COMMENTARY feature on you DVDs again.  Yeah...I THOUGHT so!!! <br /> <br />So-perhaps those with the \\"power\\" can do what many of us are asking:  Give us our movie back...the way it was MEANT to be seen...the way WE remember it.   <br />

B000001EAQ|5.0|This is where it's at. Pop provides the perfect soundtrack to the 90's U2 surrealism. Pop blows both ATYCLB and HTDAAB on the water. This a truly masterpiece that succesfully blends the experimental vein of their 90's. Its music makes an immortal album. The album is also a great testament to the bands ability and attitude as it saw them emerge from Achtung Baby years. <br /> <br />There is immense power and imagination in this album throughout. The lyrics are legendary and there is the last great guitar work from The Edge. 60 minutes - the longest U2 album ever - minutes of brillance.  <br /> <br />I'm not a religious person but listening to Pop in the dark is close to a spiritual experience for me. This is the greatest U2 album ever composed. Everything about it is terrific. The most diverse U2 album ever as well. If you want to experience U2 at their most creative level, you must experience THIS. <br /> <br />Pop is U2's most elaborate and layered work, and consequentially their most impressive. No album that I have ever heard left such a profound impact on me. Like a successfuly artistic movie, with every listen you can hear new components, experience new sounds, and enjoy further mind-blowing instrumentals. With its dramatic  impressive , overtoned by a collection of intelligent, experimental tunes, Pop is the complete avant garde rock compilation.  <br /> <br />
0385474547|4.0|Things Fall Apart, by Chinua Achebe is a wonderfully written story about an Ibo tribe in Africa. This novel talks about the culture, customs, and hardships of the Umuofia people. The plot of the story includes imperialism, religion, and many conflicts of tribal traditions and rituals. I believe that the imperialism in this story is the main theme and topic discussed during this novel. Imperialism is the domination of one nation over a country land or area for a number of years. The imperialism that goes on during Things Fall Apart is most definitely not good for the people of Umuofia.  <br />      When the white missionaries came to the land of the Ibo people they basically tore their world apart. These white men took the Ibo's land, people, and basically took over their lives. The white man's imperialism eventually took over the whole village. Although the imperialism did what it is intended to do, (gain more land) I disagree with the manner of which this particular case of imperialism was taken out. \\"The white man whose power you know too well has ordered this meeting to stop.\\" This quote from Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart shows how these intruders were trying to take over the lives of the Ibo people. Some people may say that these people were just trying to regulate the land without having any trouble. If you ask me they were the trouble. \\"Then they came to the tree from which Okonkwo's body was dangling, and they stopped dead.\\" This quote justly proves my point about the missionaries being the trouble in Umuofia.  <br />      Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe greatly communicates the theme and central message of imperialism and the unfair treatment of the white invaders into the indigenous people of Africa. From reading this book I learned much more about imperialism and it has given me a much better understanding of the idea of imperialism. This wonderfully written novel is a great piece of writing that I would recommend for everyone to read.  <br /><br /> <br />
0385510454|4.0|From the early reviews, I wondered what had possessed John Grisham to leave the lawyer genre for international espionage.  Upon reading the book, however, I realized that he had not really done that. <br /> <br />The Broker is part espionage thriller and part travel log, but it is really just another in Grisham's long string of lawyer novels.  Not his best, but certainly not his worst, The Broker is a nicely paced, interesting and well told story.  It also has an ending that seems to have been thought out before the author started to write...a feature one doesn't always find in a Grisham novel. <br /> <br />My only complaint with the book is that too much of the dialogue occurs in Italian which is promptly and directly translated into English. I found this mildly annoying. <br /> <br />All in all though, The Broker is an entertaining book that is easily worth both the purchase price and the time I invested in it.

B00005JN0T|5.0|I must admit I was prepared to dislike I ROBOT, simply because of its marketing and the presence of Will Smith, who although a talented and apparently likeable young man, is not one of my favorite actors.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  I ROBOT is a mindblowing exercise in technical wizardry and its borrowed Aasimov plotline is intriguing.  A surprisingly buff Smith plays a tortured detective who hates robots (we find out later in the film), and is joined by Bridget Moynahan as a scientist who helps \\"humanize\\" robots in a quest to find out why one robot has apparently murdered a human--a no no in the three laws of robots.  The suspect robot is wonderfully voiced by Alan Trydk (spelling) and he's a prime focus point in the film.<br /><br />The effects are brilliant and even though they may go over the top (particularly in the spectacular chase in the tunnel), they are certainly state of the art in their execution.<br /><br />Overall, I ROBOT is top notch science fiction entertainment.
0060574216|5.0|I finished the book cover to cover in a weekend. And I caught myself constantly nodding to each point the author makes, as if it was written specifically for me. The writing style is so sophisticated, yet simple enough to keep anyone's attention throughout the entire book. <br />I lost the love of my life, and truly regret not having read this book a looong time ago, when I was literaly been offered to do so, I am certain things would have turned out much different.

All the characters, even the bad guys, have a great sense of style and range from the very charming to the only slightly charming.  Enjoy if you are lucky enough to read it for the first time, even the second or third time!
B00003CXTG|5.0|Even though this movie's been out for a couple of years now, it's still worthy of a 'Thumbs Up' review.    Although set in the WWII Pearl Harbor location, it's a love story and a tear jerker.    Sure, many veterans may pick out inaccurate details which are part of human nature, but as a whole this movie had both my husband and myself wiping the tears away on more than one occasion. It's a love story, folks, in case you didn't notice.    We bought the movie after first renting it. It holds a prominent place on the bookshelves among our other prized DVDs. It contains a bit of history for our grandchildren later. It speaks to the heart and soul of those who lost a loved one in time of war. It reminds us that we're all human and are susceptible to the acts of mankind.    If it was a blockbuster movie due to extensive advertising, I'm glad they advertised it as such or I never would have rented it in the first place.

B0000AQVCL|1.0|Some singers might be afraid of being too personal in their lyrics - letting strangers in on more than they should know.  The isnger for Jet gets aroudn this problem by writing really bad, uninspired lyrics that could vaguely be connected with somebody's life.  If this was their 15th album and they were 80 years old, that might be ok - they'd just be played out.   As it is they're good at doing coke, and that's about it.
B000683VI4|5.0|Well, I won't go into the plot as others have already done so, but I will tell you that this movie rates right up there with the best of the best love stories.    To me, it doesn't even matter who starred in it or who produced it, or who's photos were in the album.    The story emphasizes that two people who 'click' upon dating and feel that driving passion of wanting to be with each other WILL find a way to do so in spite of all obstacles - even if it seems to be fate that brings them together for the long duration. I believe there really are men out there who desire one woman only and will do anything to have her return the feelings. Some will remodel a house and wait for years for his love to find him again. Some will write letters on a daily basis, even though there's no return from them.     I also believe two people with opposite upbringing can complement each other, as this movie so eloquently demonstrates.    All lives twist and turn. But when we KNOW what is right for us and make the decision to follow our hearts, only good can manifest. This movie is more than a story about two people who fall in love or about dying in our old age. It's about doing what we feel led to do from within, in spite of opposing views and opinions.    If you have any emotions at all, you will love this movie, as many others have done before you.    Gail Gupton, Author: The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment and Seekers of Truth.
0385474547|4.0|Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe follows the life of an African villager, Okonkwo, and the effects of Imperialism on his life. The book's first 19 chapters go into great detail about the life of Okonkwo in his village, along with his village's traditions, beliefs, and customs. In chapter 20, the reader first hears about white men, who have invaded a village. The \\"white men\\" are Europeans who have come to colonize Africa and convert any inhabitants to Christianity. Though Okonkwo and his tribe try to stay free and protect their way of life, the Europeans, with their superior weapons, take any means necessary to bring the Africans under their rule. <br /> I found Things Fall Apart to be a very interesting book, and greatly enjoyed reading it. Achebe did an excellent job going in-depth into the lives of African villagers, including in his book many of their traditions and beliefs. The way that he has so much of the book about Okonkwo and his life, and only includes the Europeans for the last five chapters shows how quickly the Europeans drastically changed the African's lives forever. <br /> In this story, the effects of Imperialism greatly harmed the Ibo people. One example of this is the village of Abame. The people of this village killed a single white man because it was predicted that he would be the downfall of their village. Other white men avenged this man's death by killing every man, woman, and child in Abame. Because of the Europeans desire to Imperialize Africa, an entire village disappeared off the face of the earth. Another example of the terrible effects of Imperialism is the death of Okonkwo. The white men wanted to show their total power over the Ibo people, and so they captured Okonkwo and a few other leaders. Okonkwo, who wanted to live free or die, chose death.  <br />
B0006GAI6Y|5.0|Ah yes, dashing Richard Gere, gorgeous Jennifer Lopez - what a pair as they move seamlessly together in the ballroom moves!    You'll laugh, perhaps cry. You'll feel the emotion of wanting to fill a void in your life, as Gere's character settles on dance classes to make him supposedly 'happy'. But what he discovers is a totally new and fulfilling talent.    Don't we all sometimes feel we live a mundane life? Wife cooking, cleaning, running the kids here and there, meetings, shopping, etc. Husband shuffling back and forth between office and home, taking in a golf game, watching TV, entertaining the neighbors next door, working out in the gym. Don't we all wish we could just find a new way of adding something to our lives without taking anything away?    Susan Sarandon has reason to wonder. Her husband's acting strangely and going out without explanation. But it all comes together in the end with a wonderful expression of happiness for all.     Excellent. This movie is a keeper. Plus, I love to dance so it's even more special. A ballroom dance teacher I know said she had seen the movie in the theatre four times and took some of her students. You'll feel the passion Gere's character felt when he was on the dance floor, doing something he unexpectedly discovered he LOVED.    Buy this movie and watch it often. Take dance lessons yourself or find your hidden talent. Be HAPPY.    Gail Gupton, Author: The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment and Seekers of Truth.
B0006M4SO6|3.0|one can classify PM's music into four categories. 1. the american garage.  easy listen, a little bit of pop oriented good jazz nonetheless.  2. new chatagua.  mostly acoustic guitar, lots of guitar solo, good melody jazz.  3. first circle. variety of styles with some avante garde experimentation, easy listening mixed with serious jazz, melodic ballad style mixed with experimental jazz.  4. 20/20. the ornette coleman, serious avante garde. over time, PM always stays within this \\"4\\" yet you can almost feel he is trying to develop something more.<br /><br />The Way Up seems to navigate along all four categories.  very good concept however, PM seems to forget the UP and the music stays down near the ground level and the music never seem to take off for the UP (as the CD title states). like a symphony, there is the mellow phase, the intense phase then back to mellow phase, this CD, for all of its 68 minutes, constantly stays in the mellow phase and never took off.  however, unlike some of PM's mellow music (e.g. the acoustic rendition tribute to Bill Evans on the First Circle) , even the mellow part of the music never trigger emotions.  it almost feels like listening to movie soundtrack but without the movie.<br /><br />from an instrumental aspect, none of the musician really standout.  that includes PM himself. the exception may be the trumpet/cornet(?) piece, the trumpet rendition truly adds dimension and variation to PM's music, unique and \\"different\\".<br /><br />despite the 3 star rating, i applaud PM's spirit of innovation.  a sense to constantly developing new music.  when you look around the scene.  from Rolling Stone to McCartney, they are just playing the same old same old ala picking up social security check - no mental work and no \\"music\\" involvement.  music is really a money making scheme for these folks.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is truly an incredible experience. I'm a huge musical fan - having seen and listened to many over the years. However, never before have I cared so much about the characters and story as I have come to for this musical. This, however, is a recording best suited to those who have seen the show - all the dialogue is cut out, along with one song, in order to keep people from being spoiled. The result is just the songs without the story to string them together - leaving people thinking there IS no story in between, which is absolutely untrue. Go find a description, go see the show, and then you're more likely to understand.     Of course, it's still entirely possible to fall in love with the musical by listening to the songs on this CD. I fell for it after coming across \\"No Good Deed\\" purely by accident. I became addicted, and had it on repeat from then on - the emotion and power that Idina Menzel puts into her performance is absolutely captivating. It remains my favorite song on the CD.    Something also interesting is the powerful, dark undertones in the music - in the love song, \\"As Long As You're Mine\\", a pounding, stirring theme keeps it from being a typical cheesy ballad often found in musicals. Instead you are left with a feeling of awe, of a power hidden just beneath the surface.     The songs, rather than being pieces of abstract beauty that you listen to and appreciate but not identify with, hit closer to home. They deal with everyday frustration, hope, silliness, love, that you can understand and feel. Ever had difficulties with a roommate? Try \\"What Is This Feeling?\\", which is a hilarious anti-love song. Ever felt ignored or not good enough? Go for the sweetly sad \\"I'm Not That Girl\\". How about having just hit a break, and feeling that your future is limitless? \\"The Wizard and I\\" captures that for you. It's not the beauty they're aiming for, it's the feeling, the emotion that you will remember.     How about just plain silliness? \\"Popular\\" will always brighten your day. And, of course, the wonderful, triumphant \\"Defying Gravity\\", in which your heart will soar along with Idina's glorious voice. Sure, there are forgettable songs on this soundtrack - but the true triumph of it is that the characters will endure. \\"No One Mourns the Wicked\\" is one of the most unique ways I have ever heard a musical opened, it pulls you from the first notes. \\"For Good\\", in it's delicate, loving beauty, is the perfect dedication to someone who has changed your life.     If you listen to musicals just to listen to pretty music, this may not be the right thing for you. If, however, you are looking for characters that will make you care and a world you will want to explore, definitely go for it.     Reading the book alongside the musical also serves to let you fall even more for these characters and their world. It's interesting, because the book, while wonderful, is much darker than the musical - and you can listen to the musical's songs after reading to perk you back up. Not to mention the voices of Menzel and Chenoweth will forever be Elphaba and Galinda in your mind.    It's been said that this does not have music as wonderful as some other musicals such as \\"Les Miserables\\", and this is true. However, the power in \\"Wicked's\\" music lies in it's story, in it's themes, and in the fact that by the time you reach the end, you'll want to hold on to them and make them stay. The music is just a nice companion.    See it. Listen to it. Read it. Do whatever you can - and be prepared to fall in love with Elphaba and keep her story in your heart. She's certainly become a part of mine.
0385510454|5.0|This book reads like water. It goes down easily and you can see the movie in your mind as when I was a child I could stare at the green light on the family radio and see \\"The Shadow\\". I can see Gene Hackman as the Broker and probably so can his agent.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Only watch this movie unless you are prepared to be reciting its lines for a long time.  The character of Napoleon sums up a high school geek pretty well, but there is something in him that a lot of people could relate to.  One of the great things about this movie is that it has a PG rating and somehow manages to still be funny.  I would highly reccommend this movie to almost anyone.

B00009V7T2|5.0|It took me a while to get into Omar and Cedric's new outfit, the mars volta, but after giving this album a chance, I seriously believe they are better than At the Drive In. <br /> <br />The album is extremely creative, most of the time the music just explodes out of nowhere. I'm a big fan of concept albums, and this one does it well, telling the story of a friend who leads to suicide.  <br />I love Cicatriz E.S.P. (although it's a bit long with the dead time), This apparatus must be unearthed, and televators. Yet my favorite is Roulette Dares. The blues, clean guitar work towards the end elicites so much feeling I can't begin to explain. If nothing else, get this CD for that track.
B0006GAI6O|1.0|After seeing years ago 1995 Japanese original I was willing to give it a chance. But what a horrible remake! Not to mention, dancing and music choices are even worse. Practicing supposedly classic ballroom waltz (or whatever it was meat to be...) to an Argentine Tango tune from GOTAN project just kills it entirely for anyone who has at least something to do with dancing. Solo danced by J-Lo had to be in cuts.... Is Hollywood no longer capable to produce anything meaningful and on their own?
0671027344|5.0|When I first started reading this book I thought, wow I don't need to read this, I live this. Almost every teenager would probably agree. But the books becomes so much more than that. It all starts out with this boy named Charlie who is writing letters to this person who's name is never mentioned. But basically the book covers every aspect of life as a teenager. From Charlie's first date to the first time he did drugs. I think that maybe some adults should read this book. It could answer every question every parent would ever ask. The book spans Charlie's freshman year and me, being a freshman, completely understood and felt and still do feel like Charlie sometimes. This is probably the best book I have ever read and would recommend it to all ages. Everyone at some point in their life is a \\"Charlie\\".

1582403589|5.0|I had never heard of this series before I stumbled across this graphic novel collection while looking for Christmas presents for one of my sons. This is an excellent story that succeeds in drawing the reader into the lives of the characters, and leaves you wanting more at the end. The artwork is simple, but effective. A great effort all around!
B0006IIPIK|4.0|You have to take the film for what it is. First, ignore the acting, which is stilted, probably deliberately. There are references to Flash Gordon and King Kong and films of that era, it's all a load of hokum but still enjoyable, even more so second time through. The dvd extras are quite interesting and show the limited resources used for the film. Still a great achievement. Deserves more praise.
B000002P2V|4.0|After reading some mixed reviews about this album before I listened to it, I had some apprehensions about the music.  I had heard \\"Who Are You\\" and loved it, but wasn't sure about the rest, until I actually listened to the album.  Sure, it's not their best, but it is a lot better than what most other bands could do.  There are some problems, though, the synths overpower the guitar, bass, and drums, but Townshend and Moon weren't exactly playing that great.  Also, Daltrey must have decided he'd sing in one style, because he doesn't change at all.  Townshend seemed to be trying too hard with the lyrics, because they aren't that strong in comparison to past albums.  This album reminds me of \\"In Through The Out Door\\" by Led Zeppelin.  Neither were meant to be swan songs but they were.  They both were heavy on the use of the synthesizer.  They were both released at a time when punk was threatening the \\"established\\" rock acts.  Also, fans are split on opinions of this and \\"In Through The Out Door\\".  However, both albums are strong, although not among either band's greatest work. <br /> <br />Overall, it's a good album.  I wouldn't make this your first Who album, but after you've listened to their \\"classic\\" stuff (Tommy, Who's Next, Quadrophenia, Live At Leeds), this is a good album to listen to.
B0002X314C|5.0|What a amazing talent this young man is. I have enjoyed this cd so much. John Legend is reminisence of Curtis Mayfield, Issac Hayes and Marvin Gaye. Finally an artist that can sing and has staying power. This was refreshing to listen to. It is a must buy for anyone who enjoys real music. I was listening to this cd and it reminds me of a love story. He takes you from the start of a relationship throught the good times and the bad and ends it with Live it up. We finally made it. It is a love story put to music. This is the best new R&B artist out in a long time.
B0000584V3|5.0|Opeth never cease to amaze me... They started out as  a very innovative band, and it's astonishing to see how they have evolved even further over the years. \\"Blackwater Park\\", while not my favorite Opeth album, (respectively) I would dare say that their 2001 album is by far their most evolved and most atmospheric. If you're just getting into Opeth, this is the CD to start with, as it fittingly sums up the music they play. <br /> <br />There is a great sense of balance in the music here. Some complain about the small stop-go cycles on previous albums, or how the musicianship seemed a bit amateur. Here, everything flows together fluently without hesitation. Often, the acoustic guitars beautifully overlap the crystalline electric, which leads to an acoustic passage. There are a lot of \\"jazzy\\" solos to be found, setting a somber but tranquil atmosphere on songs like \\"Dirge for November\\" and \\"Bleak\\". The electric guitars hold a sharp tone while maintaining clarity. There are some great hooks thrown around, and most of the guitars carry a melodic feel to them.  <br /> <br />The vocals are as great as they ever were. Mikael's inhuman and agonized growl rings of hatred and pain, and his ice-cold <br />clean vocals are quite simply, relaxing, yet sullen. His poetic lyrics speak of nature, lost love, and depression... The lyrics here will strike a chord with everyone... Martin Lopez sits behinf the drum throne, churning out complex rhythms and fills while pummeling away on the double bass. But we also see a fine jazz style played as well, thus I would rank him as one of the best drummers in metal. <br /> <br />My personal favorite songs here are \\"Bleak\\", \\"Harvest\\", \\"Dirge for November\\", and the complex title track. \\"Harvest\\" is a beauty within itself, layering acoustic guitars with Mikael's beautiful harmonious vocals. \\"Bleak\\" sums up the album perfectly, along with \\"The Leper Affinity\\". It contains both passages of soothing acoustics and a laid-back atmosphere, alternating with the rhythm-driven passages of melodic lead guitars, solid drums, and Mikael's tortured growls. \\"Dirge for November\\" starts off with jazz-like solos topped by Mikael's quiet voice, and soon builds into a dissonant and lonely opus... A truly emotional song. The title song has to be heard for yourself to really understand how breathtaking it is...  <br /> <br />This album is sheer beauty wrapped in depression... \\"Blackwater Park\\" accurately sums up Opeth's style, and is reccommended as a starting point for newbies. A great album, to sasy the least. <br />
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This is an amazing cd that shows the chronological growth of The Beatles as a group. What an amazing progression from the early days of 'Love Me Do' to 'The Long And Winding Road'.  As evidenced by The White Album, no type of music was beyond their reach.  They touched on every type: pop, rock, counry, blues, gospel, etc.  The only disappointment is that 'Strawberry Fields Forever' wasn't included.  It should have been. It had to have been number 1 somewhere on the charts in this big world.  But this is a minor quibble.  No CD library should be without this CD. The year it came out I bought ten copies and gave them out as Christmas gifts.  No one on my Christmas list was disappointed.  By the way, be smart and get all their albums.
B0006SSOHC|3.0|\\"Saw\\" is a really creepy film that starts off creepy and ends creepy. The acting is good, until the doctor starts yelling out his wifes name too loud, then it gets hilarious. I cannot even remember the characters names, that is how unforgetable the characters were. The storyline, however, was the best part of the film. A murderer makes people go through obstacles that will end up the person in the predicament killing themselves just to survive. The film, though, was gross. An overweight man having to climb through a maz of barb wire. Then the detective later says, \\"It cut him so deep that we found traces of stomach acid on the floor.\\" Nasty. The only character that I cared about was the doctor's wife and little girl because they did not deserve for that to happen to them. The doctor and the photographer who took pictures of the doctor were not the best characters, and the actor's who portrayed them did not do a good job. My favorite character, however, was the girl who had to cut the key out of a supposedly dead guys stomach to unlock the headset that was attached to her jaw. If she did not accomplish this, the headset was going to snap and break off her jaw, causing her death. The guy, though was not dead, and she had to murder him. It was extremely disgusting, though, when it showed her pulling out his intestines. At the end, though, the doctor has to cut off his foot to get away, and it even shows him start to cut. The murderer, though I will not give it away, was witty. I would have never guessed that it would be that person. The film, overall is getting three stars from me because the storyline was excellent, but I did not care if the main characters were to die or not. They were not that likable anyway.
B0007TKH66|5.0|Enterprise is an amazing piece of television, and has only increased in quality since the first season.  For those of you despondent over the show's cancellation, fear not!  There are many ways to help save the show.  First:  buy the DVD via Amazon.  If Paramount realizes that they stand to make a heck of a lot of money on the DVDs, they might reconsider cutting the show short.  Second:  visit [...] where you can find addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and fax numbers to use to express your support for the show.  Third:  visit [...] where fans are actually attempting to raise enough money to buy another season of the show from Paramount.  In a matter of days this site has already rasied $60,000, and there have been some very large (i.e. seven-figure) pledges from deep-pocketed contributors.  So don't give up!  Star Trek: Enterprise isn't dead yet.  With your help, we can assure it receives the 5th season it so obviously deserves!
B0006419J6|5.0|Honestly, I can't think of anyone better to have played the part.  Without him, this movie would have went nowhere.  People are just not interested in artificial intelligence themes.  Especially ones without a great deal of action.  They don't want to sit through this movie and actually have to THINK.  They want action and great effects.  So why not give it to them in an attempt to bring a great idea to the surface?<br /><br />And FINALLY - someone gives us 'Man vs Machine nuts' the Terminator 3 we always wanted.  Honestly, no one cared about Arnold or John Connor.  We wanted to see battles in a revolution that is, in my opinion, inevitable.  A. I. vs Human beings. I think this movie did a very good job continuing that notion.<br /><br />Anyway, what's scary is that people still don't get it.  The threat of mankind being overrun by machines is very, very real.  Of course, not in any of our living days - But it's very possible and not too far off.  Anyone seen the Sony 'Q'?  A few years old (2002?) and the thing is downright scary to watch.  I wonder what they have now?  Who knows?  Maybe we are better off in the end to let logical machines take hold of things.  God knows we are doing a bang up job ;)<br /><br />As for the movie - If you enjoy something with great effects, plenty of action, and the thing has the ability to incite deep thought...then this is for you.  Unless, of course, you are some right-wing piece of closed-minded trash who \\"can't stand blacks on your tv\\".
B00005JNEI|4.0|The Academy Awards has snubbed two the year's most influential movies - \\"Fahrenheit 911\\" and \\"The Passion of the Christ,\\" which is unfortunate. One movie is based on a factual occurrence, while the other is a thought-provoking piece of fiction, violent, in-your-face, inconsistent and fraught with historical inaccuracies and inflammatory scenes- yet I still think Michael Moore's picture deserves an honor for ingenious creativity.
0385474547|3.0|i gave this book 3 stars because although it gave great details into what happened it was just not a book that kept me wanting to read.  another reason i gave it 3 stars is because it was preety confusing to figure out the names of people. (well at least i found it hard) <br /> <br /> <br />imperialism played a huge part in this story.  the white men came to the tribe with the intent to converting them all to catholics.  while they were there they said that their religon was all wrong and they should all turn their god(s) down and believe the one true god.  another way imperialism played a big part is when one of the abame (i believe) people killed one white man, the white men came back and completely wiped out the whole tribe. <br /> <br /> <br />i still think that you should go out and read it beacause if you like reading about tribes this is the book for you
1400032717|4.0|I was initially turned off by this  book because of the fact that a dog was found dead with a pitchfork in its body. But the book is good anyway (and I LOVE dogs). The main character, Christopher, is autistic and feels very close to animals. That's why he takes it upon himself to find out who killed the dog. He starts out by going door to door and interviewing people in his neighborhood. <br /> <br />The mystery is eventually solved (although not by the above method), but along the way we get to know Christopher, who likes the number 2, loves math, and is perplexed by the way most people's minds wander. The author does a great job of getting inside this unusual character's head and making us sympathize with him. The ending is uplifting.
0385512058|5.0|As a recent graduate from a top 10 MBA program, I am in constant search of great business books that will expand or enrich the knowledge gained during my professional and academic career. This is it! This book is both inspiring and provides an exhaustive list (along with tactics) of ways to develop and nourish relationships, both professional and personal. <br /> <br />Many people may be put off by a book about \\"networking\\" and its negative connotations. This book is NOT about how to climb both business and social ladders via the development of self-serving relationships and \\"connections\\". This book IS about the development of MUTUALLY beneficial relationships and the role they play in career and personal success. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone, whether you are a sales rep looking to increase sales or a recent college or MBA grad who seeks a more successful and fulfilling career. Even if you are only able to incorporate 1 or 2 of the techniques discussed in this book, you will see clear improvement in both existing and future relationships.  <br /> <br />One final note. When I first started reading this book, I knew that it would provide useful tips on how to develop better relationships which would help me professionally. What I didn't know was that the book would also provide tips to help building and nurturing personal relationships as well. The concept of \\"not keeping score\\" is something that has helped me personally in my relationship with my girlfriend and others who are close to me. Not worrying about keeping a running score of who has done more for the other alleviates resentment and animosity and allows you to help people you care about out of the goodness of your heart. <br />

B0006SSOHC|3.0|`Saw' is a delightful movie to review, as it is such a mix of both good and poor qualities that it is a challenge to weigh them against one another to see what comes out ahead. For the impatient, I will say that I think the two cancel one another out in weighing the overall quality of the movie; however, the interesting aspects make the movie worth seeing and buying, in spite of the negatives.<br /><br />The first and most important positive for a horror film is the visceral reaction of the viewer. Did the movie scare, frighten, or cause mad dashes to the bathroom to clean out soiled underpants? The answer to this question for me is a tentative yes, but only with regard to a single, minor character, where the movie played the `Aliens' / `The Exorcist' card which put a child at genuine risk, not the supernatural, kinda spooky, kinda neat type of menace of `Poltergeist'. So my score on this point is positive.<br /><br />A second important positive for a horror film is the inventiveness of the threat. `Halloween' scores big on this point with its creative minimalism of a psychopathic stalker with a blank, white mask. This is in strong contrast to a lot of more elaborate scare scenarios done up until `Halloween' was made, whereupon everyone copied John Carpenter's idea. Another prime example among `B' movies is '28 Days Later' which changes the rules about how zombies are expected to act. It doubles its impact by adding a twist to the behavior of a group of survivors which seems to be making a psychological statement not unlike the classic `Lord of the Flies' survivors novel. My favorite example from A list movies is the nature of the threat in `Alien'. The object lesson here is to be sure to hire a great graphic artist when you design your monsters.<br /><br />The seemingly most striking original element of `Saw' is the fact that the perp is not literally killing the victims himself, he is putting them in situations where they do things which leads to their killing themselves, or at least failing to find their way out of a trap before the trap is sprung and they are killed by the environment created by the perp. While this is the element of originality explicit in the movie, this story line may not be quite as original as the authors would have you believe. There is a strong similarity between the fate of the victims in `Saw' and the way in which the murders are done in `Seven'. In both cases, the scenario in which the vics die is connected to perceived past sins. And, the deaths in `Seven' are to some extent a result of the victims' own actions.<br /><br />The truly more original aspect of `Saw' is that it is laid out very much like an adventure video game, where progress or even survival is based on solving puzzles. Clues are doled out by a very stingy puzzle master and they are generally couched in riddles, so we double the fun by making one answer one puzzle to get the clues needed to solve the next puzzle. The frustration in seeing the nested puzzles, yet you are stuck at the first step. Reminds me of the frustration of trying to find my way into the Underground Empire in `Zork I'. I must also say that most of the perils created by the perp win points for originality. These add to the dangers to those among us with weak bowels.<br /><br />The biggest question for the audience is for how long does the filmmaker maintain the suspense for the viewer? The answers to some of the puzzles are evident to the audience long before they dawn on the characters, partly because the producers let the cat out of the bag for at least one major piece of business in their promotional material. The writer did manage to keep the identity of the ultimate perp hidden until the very end of the movie, largely by presenting us with a fairly transparent red herring that kept our attention diverted from the real puzzle master.<br /><br />Weighed against these positives is a rather serious list of negatives beginning with the question of whether the twomain characters would really behave as they did in the movie if they were presented with their situation. I think the initial panic is real enough, but I think the writer does not give enough credit to the problem solving abilities of a normally intelligent person, and at least one of the two principals is a highly educated surgeon. I really suspect that with the tools at hand, the two principle vics would have been a lot more clever in being able to free at least one, so he could go get help. As evidence of this, I offer the resolution to a similar problem in Stephen King's novel `Gerald's Game'.<br /><br />If you resolve the improbabilities, you are left with some bad writing for the roles of the police detectives working this case, lead by Danny Glover. The glaring contrast between Glover in this movie and Academy Award winner Morgan Freeman in `Seven' makes my point better than anything else I can say. This is not Glover's fault, except in the fact that he decided to play this weak role to begin with. I am inclined to say that the movie would have been much better if the roles of Glover and his partner had been eliminated or minimized. The movie makers probably felt they needed the detectives' business to have someone to chase perps and take bullets from the potential perp and from booby traps, since the two main characters are trapped inside their own personal dungeon. The cops also introduce scenes from past perp scenes that fill out the way in that our perp works and thinks.<br /><br />The movie does not live up to its hype, but it is worth a good chill.ther the two main characters would really behave as they did in the movie if they were presented with their situation.

B000035Z1Z|4.0|I have loved this movie for some time, and just saw it again.  It's entertaining, sweet, and plain old fun.<br /><br />It maybe isn't the most realistic, but for romantic escapism, it's tops.  Kevin Klein is great here, as usual, and believable as a Frenchman thief who finds his heart stolen by a whimsical, befuddled woman (Meg Ryan).<br /><br />I'm not a big Meg Ryan fan, but she's wonderful in this piece, and makes a remarkable transformation on screen from horrified, squeaky girl to remarkable and capable woman.  Klein undergoes a similar softening transformation.  It's a subtle and gradual change for both, and the effectiveness and tightness of the screenplay and dialog contribute to a wonderfully-entertaining overall product that I can watch over and over again.<br /><br />The pacing is great and the supporting characters (particularly the concierge at the hotel) are wonderful and help contribute to the fun.<br /><br />I had a copy, but a friend \\"borrowed\\" it indefinitely.  Now that's a sincere endorsement.
B0002858YS|5.0|I love this album.  I first heard the Killers on the OC and have loved them ever since.   I'm a little concerned about some reviewers above who don't seem to understand some of the songs.  Everyone says 'Midnight Show' is an up-tempo, happy, party kind of track.  Ummm...hello?  Are you not listening to the lyrics?  It's about a guy who kills his girlfriend!   What's happy and carefree about that?   Still - a great song and I love it. <br /> <br />
B0007GADZO|5.0|Guitar genius Steve Vai's latest release \\"Real Illusions: Reflections\\" is a phenominal concept disc that just blew me away from the beginning to end. <br />From the first track \\"Building the Church' which rocks to other exceptionally played tracks such as \\"Glorious\\" to \\"Lotus Feet\\", the live track backed by a danish orchestra. All the tracks find Vai at his best along with the very talented Billy Sheehan on bass and Jeremy Colson on drums. <br />It's a very refreshing rock disc with outstanding performances by the afore-mentioned. It rocks.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Yes, that right. This album came from literally nowhere and became one of the best Alt-rock albums in years. At such a relatively young age, Alex Kapranos and crew have managed to piece together an album that any rocker could be proud of. <br /> <br />The quartet from Glascow put together an incredibly solid first outing, probably the strongest 1st album by a band since Scissor Sister's debut. They consistantly string jangly guitar lines and semi-retro vocals together into 11 varied styles of songs, but all very unique and powerful and surprizingly fresh. <br /> <br />I've had the album for almost a year now and it's still in the top five played albums in my collection. The album is definentely Alternative based, but has flashes of dancehall greatness that makes the album fun and somewhat jovial.  <br /> <br />If you enjoy jangly guitars, fast paced riffs, fitting vocals and just an overall enjoyable album, Franz Ferdinand is a safe bet for almost anyone.  <br /> <br />And as an incentive, some of their new material is just as strong, and hopefully their next album can be this strong, since if it can be, it would be a feat not achieved in quite a long time in the alt-rock world. <br />
B00024I2Z4|3.0|Mulan 2 I had hoped to be with abit more action and exciting and so as the 1st one. This movie is more about for little girls who dream of love and adventure.  <br /> <br />Not to say the movie wasnt cute to watch, just that when your taking about 3 guys to fall in love with 3 women that are destined to be with someone else.  <br /> <br />That and Mushu being a bad character this time around... was odd..  <br /> <br />I mean it was kinda a dissapointment. But anyways, I know alot has been said about this movie as it is. Just thought id drop this in.  <br /> <br />Couldve had abit more in the story in my view.

Boulez does bring some nice wonderful clarity to this complex score certainly more than Bernstein who hadn't a clue on the post-war avant-garde and the nuances and subtleties of modern orchestrations.
079073639X|5.0|What would happen if all your thoughts came true? That's the plot behind this movie. I liked this movie a lot, I'd recommend renting it. The explanation of the plot is a little weak, and there is potential in the movie for more fun with the story, The acting is decent. Samuel L. Jackson pulls off a good creepy guy, Sharon Stone is great as the borderline-nutcase, and Dustin Hoffman is brilliant as the guy who tries to figure everything out. I wanted a scary movie, but not a horror type film. This fit the bill.
B0001XAPY2|4.0|Fine story and a very good characterizations. Extraordinary for the details and precision of the drawings, particularly the aircraft details and the battle scenes. <br />And, of course, the beauty of Miyazaki art. Surely he did a lot of historical and technical researches. <br />Only a remark (not so important), that I can see - as I am italian -: the Italy rebuilt is mainly consistent, but full of absurd details, as usual in foreigner films. For instance, the people in Milan's workshop is acting as Naple's people - while they were totally different in 1930, and a lot of written texts are deeply wrong or. <br />Fine work. <br />
B000002U8G|5.0|This is where it really all kind of took form for the band after Barrett left and Gilmour stepped in. They became better with Gilmours talents on the guitar than they were with Barretts crazy geniousy. This was one of the more misunderstood albums, after this one theyre style wasnt considered as \\"weird\\" anymore as before, and its prevelent in albums which everyone became familiar with such as \\"The Darkside of the Moon\\", and \\"The Wall\\". This album is all over the place, you have from One of the days, a typical electirc packed guitar rock out Floyd song, to San Tropez, which is a classy beatle like type of song.  Then it drips down to Echoes which is a masterpeice if you really sit there and listen to it, it takes you for a ride, all 23 minutes of it.  Very good CD but not for everyone, it can change your way of thinking if you get really into it.
B00005JKNC|4.0|I have never liked Jim Carrey's silly \\"Jerry Lewis\\"-like slap stick silly comdey.... BUT... in this more serious movie, I finally saw a Jim Carrey who can actually do a good job acting.<br /><br />The only Jim Carrey film I like.<br /><br />Nice period piece.
B0006J28BO|5.0|'The Cat Returns' is a beautiful and lively story about a high-school girl named Haru. Haru has grown tired of her normal daily routine between school and friends. One day Haru saves an unusual cat, who had a lovely package in his mouth. Haru is even more surprised when the cat actually starts talking to her. However, for Haru the adventure had only just started.<br /><br />Haru soon learns that because of her good deed, Haru must marry the cat prince. Haru is of course totally freaked out about this. She doesn't know what to do.  Soon Haru mets a very handsome and distinguished cat named the Baron. When Haru goes to the cat bureau, her life changes forever.<br /><br />The D.V.D has excellent features and talks about the origins of 'The Cat Returns.'  The movie is also great because of the talented actors who dothe voices of the characters. This may not be one of Mizyaki's best movies, however I still found it delightful to watch. The characters are<br /><br />charming and I especially think that younger children will enjoy it.
B000683VI4|5.0|The NoteBook. James Garner and Gena Rowlands have a major part in this movie and Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams comprise the rest of the major roles. This movie was so sad and so funny at times. It touched my heart in a way that suprised me. The acting by all 4 of these actors was supurb and that alone made the movie worth watching, but the story line also carries it along with ease. <br /> <br />Ryan and Rachel play the younger version of the characters that Garner and Rowland play older. The scene changes from past to present are done so well that you don't even seem to recognize it was happening. (We hate, in fact despises movies that do flashbacks; so this is quite something that they did it in such a way that we didn't even notice it)..... <br /> <br />The storyline, without giving much away is: You never forget your first love. The movie is set during WWII with the Rich Girl and the Poor Boy, and how fate takes over, with help from her parents and the war. This is a 4 hanky movie, particularly as it nears the end.
0062502182|2.0|I picked up this book while I was traveling, and due to its brevity and fairy-tale language, it was a mere two-hour read. And I was thankful for that - I was thoroughly disappointed, and I kept wondering how this book could  have been so warmly recommmended to me...<br /><br />The truths about humanity and life \\"revealed\\" by this tale is not that much different than what an average episode of Oprah would conclude. The plot, the language and the message were overly simplistic - there is hardly any real character development (although the protagonist is supposed  to go through a life-changing event), and all the pseudo-intellectual descriptions of alchemy bordered on the banal. (I was also quite surprised to read in the afterword that the author has actually been a follower of this age-long practice...)<br /><br />I must conclude that I am still a bit stunned about the popularity of this book.  While growing up I loved fairytales  and fables, and this story reminded me of those; however, I fail to recognize the significance beyond typical fairytale  fare...
B0002858YS|4.0|A very impressive debut CD by this Las Vegas quartet. Brandon Flowers and Co. are not New Wave clones, as one reviewer stated below. They only build upon their influences, which range from The Cure and Morrisey to (at least to my ears) Roxy Music, early Cheap Trick and David Bowie. I like how the band usually avoids the \\"big drum\\" sound of the 1980s, and how the drummer plays a lot on the off-beats, the way Kenney Jones played in the Faces and on the Rolling Stones'  \\"It's Only Rock and Roll\\" single. \\"Hot Fuss\\" also includes some interesting, very inspired guitar work and bass playing, as well as Flowers' atmospheric keyboards and surprisingly diverse vocals. Listen to how he sounds so different at the beginning of \\"All These Things That I've Done,\\"compared to the rest of the CD. \\"Mr. Brightside\\" has some of the most inspired instrumental enemble playing that's been heard on radio in a long time. <br />On a side note, it's a shame that those who attack The Killers' sound and style now don't go after bands like Jet, which does more of a job aping and ripping off an older band (AC/DC). The Killers isn't the greatest band to walk the earth, but it certainly is a much more interesting group than 95 percent of what's out there in the secular field now. A solid group with a solid, A- first record.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The only bad thing about this series is that you'll be left wanting more, as Firefly was undeservedly prematurely cancelled by shortsighted TV execs (Now that's never happened before!!!), but the 14 episodes in existence are total gems. Excellent writing, witty dialogue, great characters that you really care about, humorous and dramatic storylines...and the list goes on!<br />An intriguing and entertaining blend of western and sci-fi, but even if you're not particularly a fan of either of those genres, you're sure to enjoy it.<BR>Buy it now...you won't regret it! (Just look how many people have taken the trouble to submit reviews (this is the first time I've ever cared enough to submit one), we can't all be wrong!)<br />And don't despair...a film is now on the way (Serenity), due out in September 2005. (Hopefully to be followed by sequels, and, in a perfect world, resumption of the TV series!) Mark it in your diaries, and go along to your local cinema (with as many family members and friends as possible!!) and show your support for Serenity, Captain Tight-pants and the rest of the crew!!
1881273156|5.0|You will get a pretty good idea of what the book is about from the book's description/jacket and from the reviews.  In short, Person A will feel love more effectively if someone else is \\"speaking\\" to Person A in their primary love language.  And Person B usually finds it easier to demonstrate love using their primary love language.  But if A and B have different primary love languages, the communication can break down. <br /> <br />Chapman does a great job of explaining this in more detail in the book and gives practical ways to use this information.  That is what I think is the best part of the book and what makes it so valuable.  He helps you to understand his ideas and then gives you ways that you can practice these ideas.  And once you take some time to think about the concept, you realize that it isn't hard to do.  It makes sense and can become something that is a regular part of your life. <br /> <br />It isn't necessarily easy because some of the things we currently do are almost instinctual but the new ideas really aren't too foreign.  So, while it may be hard to actually do something new and different, at least this book makes it fairly easy to get the ideas going in your head.  I have found myself reflecting on concepts from this book many, many times since I read it for the first time several years ago.  And once it becomes something you can think about regularly, putting it into practice comes easier. <br /> <br />I can't think of too many things better than improving how I show love to other people, whether that is love in a friendship, to family, to my child, or to my wife.  It is a different type of love for each and using different love languages helps me communicate that.
B00005K9LK|4.0|This is one of those albums that every metalhead must have in their collection. It has so many fine points. \\"Metal God\\" Rob Halford screams out those lyrics like no one else could. The instrumental portion is also quite good. There is no denying that Priest has talent.  <br /> <br />The songs on here are all good. The only problem I have is that \\"You've Got Another Thing Coming\\" is often noted as their best. I find it is quite overrated and is my least favourite track on the album. Songs like \\"Electric Eye\\" \\"Bloodstone\\" and \\"Devils Child\\" are what define the NWOBHM genre and are all instant classics.  <br /> <br />This isn't the best British Heavy Metal album out there, and falls short to a lot of Maiden's albums, but it is a Metal classic that every Metalhead should weclome into their collection with open ears.
B000002AP1|4.0|Just as a warning, particularly if you're listening on headphones, double check where you've got your volume control before you begin playing this 1997 version of \\"Raw Power\\".  Even if you think you have your volume at a regular level, you may be in for a hell of a jolt because this CD is mixed so loud it's almost beyond all belief.   <br /> <br />A previous reviewer actually seems to have it backwards--this here is the 1996 remix of \\"Raw Power\\", while the \\"Millenium\\" version appears to be the original mix.   <br /> <br />The original 1973 version of \\"Raw Power\\", mixed by David Bowie & Iggy Pop, had become the source of much controversy over the years, with many fans feeling that Bowie basically sucked the \\"blood and guts\\" out of the album.  Despite this, Iggy had been reluctant to remix the album--he acknowledged the flawed nature of the original mix, but as he says in the liner notes for this 1997 version, he \\"never wanted to f*** with it\\".  However, someone at Sony/ Columbia decided the album was going to be remixed with or without Iggy--so, definitely wanting to be involved, Iggy remixed the album in 1996 along with mix enginner Danny Kadar, and Bruce Dickinson, the executive producer for this reissue.   <br /> <br />Ironically, it seems that the release of this remixed version has fueled the debate even further.  Iggy did get a little carried away by wanting everything \\"in the red\\" here, resulting in sometimes frustrating levels of distortion even at low volume.  Indeed, you could write a whole essay comparing the differences between the two versions.  One on hand, any serious Stooges fan already owned a copy of the original \\"Raw Power\\" in some format, but still though, I think they should have included both the original mix & the new mix together on the same CD instead of having this essentially \\"take the place\\" of the original.   <br /> <br />As for the \\"Raw Power\\" album itself, it's not hard to see why it's received its legendary status--this stuff is absolutely blistering hard rock, even more so with the Iggy Pop remix.  If you're a big fan of stuff such as mid-'70s Aerosmith and haven't heard this album, you're missing out big time.  The band lineup is 75% the same as it was on the first two Stooges albums--Scott Asheton was still on drums, & brother Ron Asheton was still on board but was on bass with new member James Williamson taking over the guitar chores.  It seems to have made a big difference--unlike the first two Stooges records which lean  more towards garage rock, \\"Raw Power\\" is basically hellacious hard rock.  Williamson co-wrote every track on \\"Raw Power\\" with Iggy, and although Williamson was a somewhat more technically accomplished guitarist than Asheton, his lead guitar work on here is still pretty damn primitive.  Classic tracks include the hard-charging \\"Your Pretty Face Is Going To Hell\\" aka \\"Hard To Beat\\" and the haunting \\"Penetration\\".  \\"Death Trip\\" does kinda ramble on, but with Iggy's hysterically over-the-top wailing, it's otherwise another gem.  Although Iggy says \\"I Need Somebody\\" was an 'obligatory' ballad, don't let that fool you--it's a gloriously menacing bluesy track that manages to fill the \\"ballad requirement\\" while still totally kicking butt.  The hyperactive, hand-clap fortified \\"Shake Appeal\\" is also a load of fun.  The versions here of \\"Your Pretty Face Is Going To Hell\\" and \\"Penetration\\" remove the rather foolish stereo drum echo, a welcome change.  On the other hand, the original \\"Gimme Danger\\" actually has a different vocal take than the one heard here and it's a slightly preferable version.  The original \\"Search And Destroy\\" too has a certain raw bite that got replaced by a more of a metallic grind.  The songwriting does occasionally falter on \\"Raw Power\\"--the chorus on \\"Search And Destroy\\" feels tossed off and lacks conviction; plus the title track is filler--it sounds like a limp rewrite of \\"Your Pretty Face Is Going To Hell\\" as if they needed one more track to fill out the album.  As a previous reviewer wisely pointed out, any serious fan is going to want both versions of \\"Raw Power\\"--it's fascinating to see how they differ, plus they each have their own appeal.  Still, if you're only familiar with the original mix, you're really missing out if you don't check this remixed version out.  Plus, this version also features extensive, highly informative liner notes from Iggy himself which are a superb bonus.
1563523302|5.0|This look into America's wealthy is enlightening and motivating in ways I did not anticipate.  The authors point out that your neighbor who drives a Lexus and lives in a large home in a high priced neighborhood is likely to be house poor and as poor a manager of money as someone who can't afford to buy a home.   <br /> <br />This book stresses the importance of frugality and instilling strong money management in your children instead of providing high priced items and homes for them.  More importantly, it stresses that it is possible to change the way you spend and save money and that you can change your economic future.   <br /> <br />This book gives hope to the everyday person and illustrates that it is not essential to make over six figures in order to retire as a wealthy person.  The little guy can make it and retire a millionaire.  This book should be required reading for every college student and young adult.
B000005IU2|5.0|Much is made about how The Stooges paved the way for the punk rock explosion of 1976/ 1977, but the thing is, it's kinda hard to even put into words what they actually accomplished with their second album, 1970's \\"Fun House\\".  \\"Fun House\\" does basically pick up where their 1969 self-titled debut left off, a key album in its own right which John Cale produced.  However, the swirling, fiery album cover of \\"Fun House\\" suggests that this is going to be even more intense, and it is, which is saying a lot--this album is simply unhinged and through the roof.       One thing that really sets \\"Fun House\\" apart from almost anything else in rock history is that it's visceral, unhinged, and extreme, yet it doesn't sound like it was made by a mere bunch of obnoxious poseurs--in other words, this stuff is REAL.  Also, contrary to what some would try to lead you to believe, the sheer *sound* on on this album is absolutely incredible--\\"Fun House\\" was 'produced' (ahem) by former Kingsmen member Don Galucci, who seems to have played a key role in guiding the band, and it's kind of hard to believe that this timeless album dates all the way back to 1970. Scott Asheton's crisp, ferocious drumming is masterful and perfectly captured in the mix, and when you add to this the late Dave Alexander's bass guitar work, they result in an astonishing rhythm section.       Scott's brother Ron Asheton's guitar playing rather primitive, but absolutely brilliant and awe-inspiring (similar to Neil Young in a sense).  He gets huge mileage out of dissonance, and his playing manages to sound highly spontaneous & fluid and yet every note he squeezes out of his instrument seems to be in exactly the right place.  Notice how he often makes sly variations on the main riffs instead of just playing them the same way all through a song. Ron also makes masterful use of effects such as wah-wah and blazing distortion--just check out his incendiary solo on \\"1970\\" for proof.     Of course, you couldn't find a more ideal vocalist for this material than Iggy Pop--with his primal screams, his uncanny use of his wide vocal range, and his edgy desperation, his performance is cathartic.     All that said, I haven't even mentioned yet that, aside from the atonal, chaotic album-closing freakout \\"L.A. Blues\\", every track is insanely catchy--\\"Down On The Street\\", \\"Loose\\", \\"1970\\", and of course \\"T.V. Eye all have deathlessly catchy riffs. (Plus, the main riff on \\"Loose\\" sounds nearly identical to the riff Deep Purple subsequently used on their signature song \\"Smoke On The Water\\", only without the flatted fifth chord!)       They slip in a ballad of sorts with the haunting \\"Dirt\\", yet in a way you don't even notice that they're filling the 'ballad requirement' because it totally kicks in its own right--it features powerful, brilliantly executed guitar fills played over a slow, stomping beat & an ominous bass line.  The album's pacing is flawless--\\"Dirt\\" gives you something of a breather while still keeping the intensity level high prior to the sheer mayhem of the last 3 tracks.    The last 3 tracks all feature superb saxophone work from Steven Mackay--his work manages to fit right in while also adding another element to the sound.  An obvious huge influence on these guys was James Brown, which really comes to a head on the title track, which is obviously and thoroughly based on Brown's \\"Cold Sweat\\" (the bass line, the stuttering rhythm, the vocal yelps, the 7+ minute arrangement); with its impossible-to-resist main riff, is kind of the centerpiece of the album; and it leads into the chaotic album closing meltdown of \\"L.A. Blues\\" which really makes sense in the context of the album, plus it's an effective 'sound painting' in its own right.  Granted, a whole album of \\"L.A. Blues\\"-style chaos would be overkill, but at under 5 minutes, it serves as a fitting finale to an extremely unique masterpiece.     To sum it all up, I really don't see how you can consider yourself a true rock & roller without The Stooges' \\"Fun House\\" in your collection--it's an intoxicating, thrilling listening experience.
068484267X|4.0|Frank McCourt, the author of the touching memoir, Angela's Ashes, commences his life in Brooklyn, New York in 1935. There, his mother, Angela becomes depressed after the death of the newly born, Margaret. The family returns to their homeland, Limerick, Ireland. This concept is bizarre because then, most people departed Ireland destined for a new life in America; however the McCourt's do the complete opposite. Many problems arise in Limerick, and their entire lives' change.   <br /> In Ireland, they move into a two-floored apartment, which is in terrible living condition. During the winter, they have to live upstairs because the downstairs is flooded. The weather changes the mood for everyone and is a symbol of many different feelings including sadness and loneliness. It sets the tone for Frank's life. In the meantime, Angela is impregnated with more children, most of whom die in the end. The father, Malachy, is an alcoholic and spends all his money earned on himself rather than his family. He shares numerous stories and legends with Frank and is able to gain his love and respect. Malachy is from Northern Ireland and everyone in Limerick, including Angela's family, dislikes him for that reason. The McCourt family is very Catholic and after Frank is confirmed, a feeling of manhood is noticed. The brothers attend an all-boy's Catholic school in Ireland; however, because they are not as privileged as many of the other boys, a feeling of lowness is perceived. After Frank becomes sick, he acquires a love of Shakespeare and his ability of language is noticed by his school, along with his talent of storytelling. Frank's father heads off to England to make money for the family, which he is supposed to send back. However, the money never shows up, except for one time. After visiting his family once, Malachy never shows up again. Frank is able to develop more as a man because in a sense, he is the man of the house. While this is happening, the family's apartment is taken awayfrom them and they have no choice, but to move in with Angela's cousin, Laman. Laman is a horrible, obnoxious man who Angela sleeps with. Frank becomes discouraged and angry with everything that is going on. Therefore, he gets a job as a messenger boy and becomes involved in a sexual relationship with a customer named Theresa Carmody. However, she dies of consumption, which leaves Frank depressed and heart-broken. The still thought of moving back to New York stays in Frank's mind throughout the entire memoir.    <br /> McCourt uses the first person point of view in his gripping memoir. The novel is made up of English writing; however he includes much dialect of the Irish, English, and American. McCourt matches up his tone with the narrator's age perfectly and as the book unwinds, he becomes more serious and mature. His humor, modesty, and down-to-earth way of writing makes the reader feel alive in the story.   <br /> Frank has to undergo many different deprived feelings. He has to suffer hunger, disregard, the depressing weather, his father's alcohol problem, disease, poverty, and many deaths. Many people look down at him because of his social standings. He receives hostility from the schoolmasters, priests, his family members and sometimes, himself. He wants to rise up from poverty more than anything.  <br /> The authors writing style is unusual. An excerpt from the book that greatly displays the authors style takes place on the first page of chapter one, when McCourt describes his life, \\"When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood...the poverty; the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father; the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire; pompous priests; bullying schoolmasters...Above all- we were wet\\" (11).  <br /> In a way, the author is misleading the reader because he is using humor, when really the story is not humorous, but only depressing, sad, and cheerless. McCourt has a strong adult opinion at this point in the book, but this is the only time, because after this, the book takes the opinion of a child and their perspective on life.  <br /> Personally, realizing how deprived a child's life can be, I am able to realize how privileged I am. I am able to eat, have shelter, have a family, be clothed, and able to afford proper medicines. Frank McCourt has to endure many hardships; ultimately, his childhood is a hardship. However, he is able to make the best of his childhood and fulfill his upbringing dream. After reading this memoir, my perception has changed and broadened. It helped change my outlook on life, my anger, my sadness, and most of all, myself.  <br />

B000002JEV|5.0|BBC Sessions (1997.), a collection of early Led Zeppelin radio sessions<br /><br />The Led Zeppelin BBC Sessions are a priceless addition anyone who is even remotely a fan of the great band. Copies of official Led Zeppelin live performances are extremely hard to come by (the only others really are 'Song Remains the Same' and 'How the West was Won') and so this double CD is a timeless capture of the band in their early years. What makes this compilation more than just a collection of live radio broadcast performances is the fact that it also captures Led Zeppelin in their transition period (I'm referring more here to the second CD which has the early 1971 sessions) and includes a very much unrefined, early but certainly enthralling version of 'Stairway to Heaven'. The other CD has performances from 3 recording sessions in 1969 with much of the bands early stuff (i.e. Led Zep I and some of II tracks) as well as 3 tracks which do not feature on any of Zeppelin's studio albums. These tracks, 'That Girl She Got Long Black Wavy Hair', 'Travelling Riverside Blues' and 'Somethin' Else' make great extra additions to any Led Zep fan's song collection. What we basically see with the Sessions, the first CD in particular, is the essence of early Zeppelin at its rawest and freshest. The band show great perfection in a number of ways with these radio performances whilst at the same time giving a great deal of improvisation which works really well.<br /><br />Most of the songs which were recorded live at the BBC appeared on John Peel's 'Top Gear' a few days after they were performed in each case - there are a few exceptions, 'Since I've Been Lovin You', 'Black Dog' and 'Thank You' from the '71 sessions were remarkably not transmitted, a bit of a loss really but still they're here now on this unique CD!<br /><br />CD 1 contains lots of the hard rocking early stuff and they play it live in style. There are 3 great renditions of 'Communication Breakdown' and the 10 minute version of 'You Shook Me' is a real treat. I personally enjoy the second CD more than the first. 'The Immigrant Song' and 'Heartbreaker' start the whole thing off in emphatic style before Led Zep do a classy performance of what I would rate as their greatest blues track, 'Since I've Been Loving You'. An early, pre Zep IV release of Black Dog follows this - an interesting listen - the start fooled me at first as they begin this version with the 'Out On the Tiles' riff! The 5th track, an 18 minute version of 'Dazed and Confused' is what Zeppelin live is all about - a brilliant performance of one of their best ever tracks. Jimmy Page's guitar playing here is sensational with some brillaint experimentation, coupled with some fast, killer lines blending in with this - Led Zeppelin were truly one of the masters of that great 70's art of drawing out a track whilst live as long as possible whilst still keeping that suspense and imagination. In context, the following track, the early version of Stairway to Heaven is mindblowing. Not only is it a great performance of the track but how weird must it have been for the audience to be one of the first to hear what was to become one of the great rock anthems of all time! Led Zep follow this up in style with some of their acoustic stuff with folk ballad 'Thats the Way' and 'Going To California', a track which is one of the most inspirational acoustic tracks of all time. The band round off with a 'Whole Lotta Love' medley with some blues covers incorporated within and then a finale in the shape of 'Thank You' which, in my opinion outstrips the version on the Led Zep II studio album.<br /><br />All this leaves me to say is that with the BBC Sessions you are witnessing a timeless capture of perhaps the most influential rock band of all time. Led Zeppelin are performing at their best here and this double CD should be just as important as the studio albums in any Zeppelin collection.treat.

B00000IMTE|5.0|I keep reading reviews of Rainbow albums as decent or average, which is an understatement.  While Rainbow never reached the musical heights of Deep Purple, the band was, in it's own right, influential in creating the gothic hard rock sound that so many derivative 80's English metal bands embraced.  I admit that I AM biased in Blackmore's favor, but that's because he is THAT good of a guitarist and quite underrated. <br /> <br />Listen to each song, but don't waste your time on \\"If You Don't Love Rock and Roll,\\" which elicits about as much emotion as watching lichens growing on rocks.  However, \\"Man on the Silver Mountain\\" and \\"Self Portrait\\" are 70's metal classics.

I actually read it months after reading the first Farseer book, Assassin's Apprentice, which I honestly did not find particularly spectacular.  So I moved on to Royal Assassin and could not put it down.  This book and the third one cost me some serious school credit, but being a burned out high school senior I did not really care. <br /> <br />Never have I read a fantasy so emotionally racking.  I traditionally don't like first person perspectives, but in the instance of this book, it fully illuminates intense emotions in a way that a third person would have tremendous difficuly achieving.  Yes, this book is extremly depressing, perhaps overly so for many readers, but immensely intriguing becasue of its dark depressing quailities.  I admit that it is one of the very few books I have read that made me almost cry.  Its ability to rip your guts out is its beauty, and I say this with me being the most unemotional person I know. <br /> <br />The main character, FitzChivalry Farseer, through whose perspective we see the story, is my favorite literary character to date.  What makes him so good is that he is his own character, not some plot device that we see far too often in fantasy. <br /> <br />This book and the rest of the trilogy stand head and shoulders above the rest of the genre.  If you want phenominally good fantasy, by all means read Farseer.  If you are tired of reading the average trash by the likes of Robert Jordan, then treat yourself to something that is more than deserving of your time.
068987474X|5.0|Although this light-hearted, lucid, & comical little book is intended for the single women out there, it can also be enjoyed by men as well (and is -- on some levels -- equally applicable).  I suspect the strategies Behrendt outlines are intuitively recognized by all and now that this book spells it out in black-and-white --- it should no longer be intuitive --- it should be obvious!  I applaud Behrendt for his effort, although I don't recall any description of the standard 'two call rule' -- or the more dignified 'one call rule' -- that is, two (one) unrequited phone calls are equivalent to \\"I'm just not that into you\\".  A great read that is both liberating and entertaining!
0375713751|5.0|The failure of so many of today's women to develop the capacity for deep emotional attachment, and empathy, comes through in this brilliant, very entertaining tragi-comic novel. Kate, a married, hard driving investment professional and a mother of 2 young children. She can't form empathetic bonds with her children, or with her husband. Kate is clueless about the inherent emotional magic of young children. The novel makes clear her parents were very emotionally constricted people who divorced around the time of Kate's puberty.  <br /> <br />As a psychiatrist, I believe the failure to develop the capacity for effective loving and empathy derive from neurophysiological developmental failures the result of most children nowadays being daycare and nanny raised.  We all know unaffectionately handled puppies, kittens and infant primates have problems successfully mating, and caring for their young. Such would be all the more true for humans. It's one thing for day care raised children to meet basic age appropriate cognitive developmental milestones, e.g. reading, but quite another to eventually possess the rich emotional skills required for a stable marriage with children.  Women seem more affected than men. In my mid-60s, and having raised 4 children, I'm simply astounded by the emotional shallowness of contemporary female sexuality. What could marital love mean to a women who has been with dozens of men before her husband?  <br /> <br />Kate's unloving core behavior illustrates the absurdity of the romantic predicate of modern marriage. Kate falls in love with business contact. A female subordinate asks her, \\" 'I'm sorry, Kate, but do you  the know the guy?' to which Kate replies, 'No, I don't'...I don't know Jack but I may be in love with him...How can you be in love with someone you don't know? It's probably easier, isn't it, all things considered. A blank screen you can type all your longings on.\\" <br />
B00004SVID|5.0|If you like The Wall, then you'll reall, really like Is There Anybody Out There?  This is not only my favorite Floyd album, but my favorite album over all.  All the songs are bigger sounding, maybe a little longer (some crazy keyboard solos), and just better.  The only song that I like better on the studio version is The Happiest Days Of Our Lives...oh well, the rest makes up for it.  I hardly listen to the studio version anymore.  If you're thinking about getting The Wall, you should look into the live version.  Not only is it nearly 25 minutes longer, but cheaper too.  There are even two new songs: What Shall We Do Now? is too cool for school (but we don't need no education), and The Last Few Bricks is just a great instrumental that reviews some of the previous melodies (this was put in so the stage hands could have more time building the wall).  Anyways, if you want a description of the tracks, you should check out my review for The Wall.  Otherwise, get this.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|(See the synopsis above for film description) <br />I feel it's important for me to say that I DO NOT LIKE watching Jim Carrey on film.  Not since Dumb and Dumber.  Every time a new film comes out, reviewers tell you `how straight he plays it' in this film.  And every time I've thought, `Okay I'll give it a go'.  And every time he's exactly the same as every other film.  Exaggerated facial expressions, over-acting and unable to play to play it straight. <br />For once, I was very pleasantly surprised.  He really IS different in this film.  And I must say that he is excellent, along with every other member of the cast.  This film is funny (without it being a blatant comedy), heart wrenching at times, and always interesting and definitely original.  Without a doubt one of the best, if not THE best film of 2004! <br />Kudos to all involved!
0440237688|5.0|Arguably, today's society has many flaws.  Imagine a society where everything is the same.  There is no colour, no distinction, and above all, everyone has a place chosen by what is best-suited for them and their  <br />community.  Everyone follows the rules and if they don't they leave.  As children grow in this community, they are taught to be exactly the same as everyone else while at the same time maintaining their personal  <br />independence.  Welcome to the world of the Giver.  Jonas has lived this way all his life, and as such he is almost mortified when he is singled out to hold a job amongst the highest ranking of elders, receiver of  <br />memory.  When you leave behind a world of pain to create a utopian society, you must remember what you left behind so that you don't revert back.  At the age of 12, Jonas is selected to be the one who remembers what his society left behind and is forced to endure pain so others don't.  The question is, will he fight what he thinks is so unfair when he is unable to leave? <br /> <br />This is a very good book that never gets dull.  Something is always happening so it will keep you on your toes until the end of the book.  Another plus is that the book is short so it doesn't take too long to add another book to your \\"read\\" collection.  It is a good book for a wide range of ages and is worth reading a second time, or third... <br />
B000002BE9|5.0|This is one of the most awe-inspiring debuts that I have ever heard in my entire life-to think that an 18-year old girl could write such lyrics and melodies makes my heart skip a beat. Fiona Apple writes and sings like she's been around for one hundred years- there is weariness and a time-honored sadness which radiates through her smoky alto and her refined, mature and simply beautiful music and lyrics. What I love most about her is that you can't dump her into a category-there aren't many artists out there like her and her music (despite what you may have heard) is unclassifiable. No doubt, Apple is in a genre all by herself. Tidal did not come out of my cd player for about a year when I first got it, and I still listen to it all the time. And every time I listen to it, I hear something new-a different nuance hidden beneath the rich layers of the music and the fantastically unique instrumentation that I hadn't heard before. It is a true pleasure to listen to it-it manages to be both emotionally stirring and relaxing at the same time. Her voice is amazing-it isn't as technically good as it is in terms of texture and emotional expression. When she sings, I believe every word she is saying-so much soul lies in her singing that every phrase comes out individually and is open for the listener's interpretation. Not only does she sing with a soul that is WAY beyond her then 18 years, but the timbre and tone of her voice itself is stunning-rich, and smoky-she can be sad, sexy, melancholic, or all these at once and more. For me, the true mark of a good singer is not how many notes they can sing, or how long they can belt out a tune for- it is how well they are able to capture the emotion of what they are singing- Fiona's got it by miles and miles. The lyrical writing on this record is some of the best I've ever heard- Fiona doesn't write songs- her songs are like poetry within music. Some have complained that her lyrics are pretentious or too metaphorical. I think that theyare perfect because she finds a way to convey her emotions in a way that is not only true and real, but that sounds beautiful and poetic.     As for the music, this is one of the precious few albums that I own to which I can listen to the whole way through- as a full recording rather than a separate set of songs. True, some songs are exceptional, while others are simply good- but no one song is conspicuously worse than the other- every song is like a chapter within the album-if one song was missing the album would be incomplete. Just to make it easier, I will group the album into two categories: the \\"good\\" songs, and the \\"exceptional\\" ones. Here goes:    \\"Exceptional\\"    Criminal- I don't know how this song became a mainstream hit-it's just on a different caliber than all the other tripe that gets played on the radio. This song is dark, sexy, jazzy, and even sad if you really listen to it. \\"But I need to be redeemed from the one I've sinned against because he's all I ever knew of love,\\" sings Fiona with equal measures of passion and bitterness in the song's excellent chorus. The whole song is driven and reckless- it doesn't stop to breathe for a second.    Slow like Honey- This song is amazing. It is very slow and jazzy, with some of the best lyrics that I've ever heard in a love song. \\"Does that scare you? I'll let you run away, but your heart will not oblige you, you'll remember me like a melody  Yeah, I'll haunt the world inside you\\" Fiona's voice sounds incredible in this song- it as at its most beautiful as she purrs and caresses her way through this haunting jazz ballad. The accompanying music is rich and mysterious, Fiona's piano-playing adding a lovely extravagance to the whole thing.    The First Taste- This song is the most experimental on the record- it has a funky beat and some very unique instrumentation. The melody is beautiful, sort of Spanish style and the lyrics are pure poetry.\\"I lie in an early bed, thinking late thoughts, waiting for the black to replace my blue, I do not struggle in your web because it was my aim to get caught, but daddy longlegs I feel, that I'm finally growing weary, of waiting to be consumed by you, give me the first taste.\\" Her voice is soft, and completely entrancing.    Never Is a Promise- This is one of the most perfectly written songs that I've ever heard. And it's even better live. The arrangements are simple but beautiful-Fiona on her piano and a lovely string arrangement accompanying her. Her voice is filled with so much emotion, she sounds as if she will cry any moment. \\"But as the scenery grows I see in different lights; the shades and shadows undulate in my perception, my feelings swell and stretch, I see from greater heights, I understand what I am still to proud to mention...to you.\\"  This song quietly builds up its intensity until it swells to a most beautiful, but very subtle climax towards the end of the song. Throughout the chorus, Fiona sings in a very high-pitched voice, making her sound almost childlike. This however, works perfectly with the song, as it adds to the vulnerability and fragility of the recording. Never is a Promise is a genius piece of songwriting straight from Apple's heart- I get shivers down my spine each time I listen to it.        Carrion- This is the perfect closing track- its mood and music end the album on the perfect note- melancholic, but hopeful. \\"My feel for you boy, is decaying in front of me, like the carrion of a murdered pray, and all I want is to save you honey, or the strength to walk away,\\" Fiona sings in the song's intense and driven chorus, with a  very effective, but subtle use of electric guitars. The distinct contrast between the chorus and the verses works very well- the verses are very quiet and all the emotion seems to be concealed, until Fiona lets it all out in the song's emotional chorus. Her voice is again not doing very much, but manages to sound amazing. Each time she repeats the chorus, she says it with more and moreconviction and intensity.     I won't go into details about the \\"Good\\" songs-if you like the exceptional recordings that I have discussed above, you will for sure enjoy the remaining songs on the album- all of which are superb in their own right, but not \\"classics\\" such as the ones I have mentioned here. I love this album, and I love listening to it because it is so honest and pure and beautiful. While her follow-up album was excellent and in no way inferior to \\"Tidal,\\" I prefer her debut because there was a certain rough and unpolished quality to the music, the singing, and the instrumentation. While Fiona certainly needs to come out with a new set of music, sometimes I feel that it's better if she doesn't- I fear that it won't match her past efforts because this minute musical legacy that she has created here is certainly hard, if not impossible when you consider that both her debut and her sophomore effort were amazing. And if she never does, that's disappointing, but forgivable- I will forever think of her as an original artist with a smoky, deeply penetrating voice that wrote those heartfelt, poetic lyrics and rich, gorgeous melodies.
0201626632|5.0|I hesitated to buy this book because it's relatively expensive for its small size.  I'm glad I bought it because after reading it (in less than three hours), I realized it's one of the most important books I had ever read!  Feibelman gives very helpful advices for not only grad students, but also postdocs and junior faculty members.  These are advices that grad schools or even thesis mentors won't give you.  Some are obvious suggestions, but many others were totally new to me.  Among many other things, this book:    1) helps you choose a thesis/postdoc lab;  2) helps you decide whether to go into industry or academia;  3) explains to you why it's not a good idea to start your career as an assistant professor;  4) tells you when is the best time to publish your data;  5) teaches you how to write good papers and to prepare for talks;  6) gives you guidelines for grant writing;  7) etc. etc.    However, it seems to me that a few suggestions may not be applicable to biologists -- Feibelman is a physicist and thus may not be very familiar with other disciplines.  Also, he seems to have overlooked the importance of networking with other scientists, for example at conferences.
0385474547|3.0|In the book things fall apart by Chinua Achebe is about a tribe in Africa that would be taken by imperialism. The tribe, called Ibo, is harmed the the imperialism more that helped. And i gave this 3 stars because it helped me realize what they went through but it was a sort of difficult read because of the funny names. <br /> <br />In a way the imperialism turned them against themselves. They would be shifted from beliving in their own religion into Christianity. They were violently murdered by settlers and they also were deprived of their Ematation of God.  It also led to one of them commiting suicide. Okonkwo killed himself because a white settler was killed by a member of the Abame tribe. So overall, Imperialism caused people to die and peoples religions to change. <br /> <br />In all, this book made me really start to think about what life was like back then. I never really thought about it until now. I would advise any knid of history buffs to pick this one up. Its a good read. This is Deron, signing off.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|To keep and short and sweet.  This documentary is amazing. <br /> <br />It lets us deeper into the lives of the Metallica boys than I'd have EVER thought possible. <br /> <br />It made my girlfriend an instant fan of Metallica (and she doesn't even like metal/hard rock). <br /> <br />It solidified my place as a fan of whatever this band does for the rest of time.   <br /> <br />Watch it and you'll love it.  Share it with a friend and they'll appreciate it just as much.
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|Marillion fans know what they like and ONLY like what they know. <br />And in this case-the usual suspect is The DickMan Hisself aka FISH. Oh Those Derick Dick Daze!  The camps are split, but many enjoy the early prog days when the 'beyond criticism' front man was in charge! When I first heard Marillion ('Jester's Script), I thought Oh NO not another BLOTTED GENESIS CLONE-The original was bad enough with its ego inflated 'Games Without Frontiers' Gabriel concepts...AND NOW THIS RUBBISH!!!  Kinda wanted to turned in a Godley/Creme Fripptronics gizmo all over again!  (What GETS ME about these so-called 'inflated proggers' is  their endearment to a self proclaimed and self aggrandized trailblazing style, but in general have 'forgetton' about the 'human side to the music.' They are so into proving their 'artsy side.'- especially their 'classical leanings.' all.  Only problem is half of em are hardly disciplined to do so!!)  Marillion fit into that discription and of course were in a long list of 'da boring' new breed.  Their output was one horrendous work after another and was getting worse.  And So was Dick's Diction!! Then we get this little poppy live ep-with the semi hit wonder-'Kayleigh.'  Failure again.  One last go round -'Clutching at Straws', and I should say, at least Mr. Fish was lightening up a bit and NOT taking his 'kingdom of loft' to excess anymore.  But guess what-the dude leaves the band.  Oh Poo! Usually those mid point crisis times gets to one's equilibrium and its time to hither the high road and go man overboard.  And this is when the reign of tears began.  What will they DO without 'his majesty' at the front helm?  Enter Steve Hogarth! (This brother was TOTALLY ON from day one!) <br />He brought a new spin to the group, plus I could understand what was being sung- very uncockney-thanks! But something 'smelled fishy' those diehards thought!  So here comes the buzzsaws, axes, knives, daggers, blockbusters, spears and then some!  Protest Protest Protest-we could never forgive this guy, Hogie, for 'RUINING' a great band when DD danced his delight till dawn!!!  But wake up wake wake up-he's here to STAY and thats a fact!  Though some begrundgingly have taken a 'liking of sorts' to this new youngblood, and have 'come around' to this 'new way of thinking.'  But still.... Can we ALL GET ALONG???  Steve Hogarth is one of the best and HAS BROUGHT A VERY DOWN TO EARTH APPROACH terribly missing from the yesteryear days of the 80's.  I mean who could take a potshot at BRIAN WILSON and make it as humourous as it was-Cannibal Surf Babe' from 'Afraid of Sunlight' and not be ashamed to rock a little (the very poppy 'Hooks in You' from 'Seasons End.  That alone says a lot!  Yeah and I was one of those 'stupidly happy' misguided ones who bought and THOROUGHY ENJOYED 'Seasons End' 'Holidays in Eden' 'Brave' (who bassist PETE T claimed in an interview sometime ago that it was a very EXPENSIVE album to record) 'Afraid of Sunlight' all on VINYL-Thank You!  and then I had the NERVE to THINK about buying 'Marillion.com' 'This Strange Engine' 'Made Again' 'Anoraknophobia' 'Anorak in the UK LIVE' and now 'MARBLES' which is a bit o' wink and a nod to  <br />those 'D-word' daze.  But hey, everything an artist does cant be perfect perfect, everything they perform cant be perfect perfect.  But as with its predecessors, it comes pretty darn close.  I mean their passions dont bore me to sleep like this new bevy of proggies do.  Well since none of these rounded objects were 'lost in transit', 'Marbles' is just what the doctor order to cure those lofty prog blues.........
B000005DSN|5.0|I hadnt heard of stratovarius before, but i recently started getting into the lesser known metal, and i heard stratovarius showed a lot of iron maiden influence so i picked this gem up. all i have to say is WOW. the album is very melodic, which, as stated, shows a lot of iron maiden influence. the keyboards, as cheesy as some people find them, work very well with the atmosphere of the album and the guitar solos are most easily compared, for me, to GnR's \\"Use Your Illusion 1&2\\". the solos remind me of Slashs work on songs such as November Rain. I highly recommed this to anyone who is a fan of classic melodic metal.
B000062X90|1.0|Yes it was a 'nice gesture' that the original bassist turned obscure studio mogul, decided to add a little extra with the lengthy live trax from the bone's 72 radio broadcast from Memphis Tn.  But how many more times are these songs going to be run into the ground-its as if no other Bone songs exist but! <br />The spiritual message of 'The King Will Come' is still intriguing but has been played better in concert esp with the twin city madness of Laurie and Andy and for the matter in the 90's with ROGER FILGATE and Andy!  The production on this album, of the 4 with original guitarist TED TURNER, still is way TOO layed back compared to such dynamo trax on the other 3 records-'Queen of Torture', 'Vas Dis'(The Brother Jack McDuff Gem), 'So Many Things To Say' 'Blind Eye' 'The Pilgrim' etc. <br />This is THE CAREER album of the early days, and those who know the band, well its their MOST favorite, so why should I spoil the fun...for me, these songs on 'Argus' are just not up to snuff.
B0002S94OS|5.0|Take it from someone who usually hates the scream-til-u-puke death metal vocals. recently i decided i was tired of listening to old metallica and maiden records, realizing i had nothing modern in my collection and it was quite depressing. so i picked up a children of bodom cd, loved it, and really got into some of the modern death metal bands.  <br /> <br />Lamb of God definately arent an underground attraction anymore, and for good reason. these are most spitfire, in your face guitar riffs ive heard since GnR's \\"Appetite for Destruction\\". Again, i usually despise talentless throaty vocals that sound like an angry teenager screaming into a pillow cuz his girlfriend broke up with him(Dark Tranquility), but Randy Blythe's vocals are surprisingly intelligent, and easy to enjoy, especially with the complex riffs in the back. each song just makes you want to bang your head to no ends, every song is a brutal masterpiece, whether the speed riffs drive you against a wall or the slowed down brutal assault drives into your skull. Again, this is coming from someone who is usually a fan of classic metal with real singing. highly recommended for a fan of metal <br />
0060730552|5.0|Excellent Inspiration <br /> <br /> The awesomely true adventure story Touching the Void, buy Joe Simpson, is the account of two men's epic battle against time, nature, and ultimately themselves. Joe Simpson and Simon Yates are experienced mountain climbers and good friends. For their next task they attempt to tackle the very dangerous West face of a mountain in the South American Andes. No one has made it down alive from this route, but Joe and Simon will be the first. Or will they? <br /> Be prepared to never put this book down. From beginning to end readers will be at the edge of their seats anticipating what is in store on the next page. Not only is this book amazing in the sense that it is a true story, but it is tremendously inspiring. Many people would simply quit, give up, if they were put in the same situation of the lead character (being trapped on a mountain alone with a broken leg). But the way Simpson looks fear in the eye and says \\"I'm not scared\\" is sure to be an excellent inspiration the un-inspirable. After reading this book one will never look at adversity in the same way again. <br /> <br />                                                                                          ---J.

She wakes up being a patient in her own prison and being accused for murdering her husband.     Miranda must try to remember what happened to her and how she ended up as a patient in the very prison she use to work at. Accused of killing her husband. While incarcerated she will see the girl that she avoided hitting with her car many times again.     Seeing everything from Miranda's point of view. We start the movie seeing the Doctors point of view. And of course we shift to the view from the patient's. Is she sane and being framed...or did she murder her husband and is truly insane.     In this movie we see that Halle Berry does know how to act. Though a good thriller, it is not the horror picture
0670033375|4.0|This is a book that if not written in America would be a lot shorter. That is it raises a number of environmental problems and suggests that there are solutions to them. However some of the solutions require some governmental or collective activity which is anathema to most Americans. For that reason the book has a long discussion of past environmental crises which have led to the collapse of human societies or ongoing serious problems. It would appear that the writer lectures at university and the structure of the chapters suggest that they are a collection of lectures.  <br /> <br />The societies that have collapsed are Easter Island, the Greenland Norse, Henderson Island, some native Americans and the Maya. The pattern is reasonably similar. Human communities have move to heavily forested areas which have varying climate patterns. The removal of the forest has initially led to productive agriculture but over time years of low rainfall have reduced productivity lead to soil erosion and environmental collapse.  In the case of Easter and Henderson Island large communities have been reduced to shadows of their former selves with cannibalism and social conflict. The Maya continued to exist as a group but the communities which built the vast cities in the Yutucan have drifted away as their agriculture has collapsed.  <br /> <br />Diamond indicates that despite the tragedies there are stories in which collapse has been averted. The Japanese after the unification in the 17th Century faced the possibility of an outcome like that of Haiti. Increasing population numbers leading to de-forestation and environmental collapse. The Japanese government however moved in the 17th and 18th Century to plant forest and limit the growth of agriculture. Fishing was encouraged instead of the use of domestic animals. A more modern example is that of the Dominican Republic which again under a dictatorial government was able to retain its forests because of the commitment of a dictator whootherwise could hardly have been said to be enlightened.  <br /> <br />In his last chapter Diamond goes on to say that the worst cases of environmental collapse are occurring in countries which have weak corrupt or collapsing government. He uses the case of Afghanistan, Haiti and Somalia to back this up.  <br /> <br />Now the suggestion that government is good for something is a hard pill for a lot of Americans to follow. If this book was released in the United Kingdom or Canada then it could have consisted of some chapters talking about environmental problems and suggesting some solutions that most would find commonplace. However as the book is American it is necessary to show how problems occur and the market, marvellous instrument that it is might not correct. Diamond goes on to outline how the market can lead to poor outcomes. Thus with the mining of minerals profitably is low and it is easier for a company to pay out profits over time and then go bankrupt rather than pay clean up costs. With the forest industry in South East Asia it is cheaper to log areas and not to create a sustainable operation as all that is necessary is to pay some bribes and harvest cost rather than rent land and pay the cost of new plantations. He uses the historical examples to show that environmental damage is not something, which will necessarily go away, or self correct quickly.  <br /> <br />He focuses his opening chapter on Montana in America to talk generally about a range of issues. Pollution due to extraction mining potential loss of habitat due to logging and so on.  <br /> <br />The book is readable and all true. However it is not really about the collapse of society it is more discussion of the environment using some old examples of collapse to suggest that this is serious.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0767834739|1.0|I watched it till the middle and wanted to throw it away.I't's an insult to the game.The acting was terrible.The story line was obvious and uninteresting.It was generally meant for those who had played the game.but I can promise you that if you have played resident evil three, you will find nothing to intrest you here.The game has more drama, more suspense more interesting and intelligent twists that the movie appalingly lacked.In my oppinion the movie itself was a good introduction, I hope the next movie will take up from there and give us something worth watching!!!!
B00005R23X|4.0|This is without question one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. It's production values are rich and gorgeous. The hauntingly original music, luscious dark cinematography, visual effects, set decoration, art direction, and magnificent costume design are unlike anything I've ever witnessed. I wish I could live in this world. Now, the performances are NOT the greatest. Reeves and Ryder look good, but their readings are too wooden. Gary Oldman is perfectly cast as Dracula. Amazing. Waits as Renfield is a casting coup. It's a shame this hasn't received the DELUXE treatment on dvd. If you own a laserdisc player there IS one to be found, released by Criterion. Columbia / Tristar needs to port ALL of Criterion's materials over to a new dvd edition NOW and give it a new remastering. Again, the performances are the film's major flaw. When films like this look this good (and using OLD filmmaking methods to boot) it can be forgiven.
0061020710|4.0|After reading lots of young adult books, I decided to try out the big kid's version of \\"The Edge Chronicles\\".  To tell the truth, this book has been sitting on the shelf for over six months, because of all the frightening reports - why go willingly into a situation that is widely known to be addictive?<br /><br />I was hesitant to get involved, but a chorus of voices kept haranguing me to make the first step, and weakened by a lack of excuses, I succumbed.<br /><br />This is actually a very complicated book, due to the various levels of humor, from slapstick to dry one-liners, expertly delivered in an incredible fantasy setting.  After you get a basic understanding of the geography of the Discworld, and work out the meaning of \\"hubward\\", \\"rimward\\", \\"turnwise\\" and \\"widdershins\\", and that there are eight seasons, you can enjoy the relatively simple story that unfolds in the last two thirds of the book.  Beware though of the many familiar references to our own world, which are thrown in randomly to retard your progress while you stop to consider them.<br /><br />A bungling wizard (with a charmed life and one good spell in his arsenal) gets saddled as a tour guide to a naive visitor from another continent.  Unfortunately, the tourist has a lot of gold to throw around, and this leads to all kinds of unwanted attention from the dregs of society.  Luckily for the tourist, he has a very useful piece of luggage that doubles as a body guard, and is self-transporting with a built in homing device - a dream suitcase if there ever was one.<br /><br />Here there be trolls, barbarians, bandits, beauties, dragons, magic, deities, and even Death, who gets quite stressed on the job, and really needs a holiday.<br /><br />Now that I'm corrupted, I need volunteers to feed my habit.  Buddy, can you spare a rhinu?<br /><br />Amanda Richards, February 28, 2005

B000059TFO|5.0|Based loosely on actual events, Mississippi tells the story of three civil rights workers, one black and two white who disappear in Jessup County, Mississippi.  The FBI sends in agents to investigate the disappearances, headed by Willem Dafoe as the young, by-the-book and a bit naive Agent Boyd.  He is joined by Gene Hackman as Agent Anderson.  Anderson himself was a former, small-town Mississippi sheriff and so has a greater understanding of the town and its people.<br /><br />Anderson and Boyd bump heads at nearly every turn of their investigation.  Boyd tries unsuccessfully to question the town's black residents but they are all unwilling to talk and with good reason...They are regularly beaten, and have their homes torched by the resident KKK members and include members of the local Law Enforcement including Deputy Pell (Brad Dourif) and Sheriff Stuckey, and other townfold including local businessmen.  R. Lee Ermey, in one of his earliest roles plays Mayor Tilman who is incensed at the investigation of his law enforecement officers.  Eventually, when Boyd fails to make any progress in the investigation, he allows Anderson to bring in his own people and use his own, less than legal methods to question the suspects which are not limited to threats and physical abuse.<br /><br />Mississippi Burning is a powerful tale of a sad time in America and this movie shows the true ugly underbelly of the deep south in the early 1960's.  But it would have been nice if all the residents were not treated as stupid redneck racists.  About the only white resident who seems to have any sympathy for the black people is Deputy Pell's wife played magnificently by Frances McDormad.  She gives a wonderful performance as a southern wife trapped in a situation that she cannot escape from.<br /><br />Also, it would have been nice to see some of the black actors given a role with a little more punch.  They all play submissive, frightened roles and one even states that perhaps if they leave the (white folk) alone they will leave them alone.  Virtually the only strong performance from a black actor comes from the Darius McCrary (Who would later play in the sitcom \\"Family Matters).  Only this boy seems to have the courage to speak out and to the FBI.<br /><br />All that aside, Hackman and Dafoe really shine in their roles and playoff each other well.  Director Alan Parker builds the tention throughout and slowly starts the cracks that will eventually bring down those responsible for killing the three young men.  A Wonderful film that is still powerful after many viewings.y leave the (white folk) alone they will leave them alone.

1400031567|4.0|Henning Mankell, Sidetracked (Vintage, 1995)<br /><br />Mankell's fourth Kurt Wallander mystery has won awards (or so the Vintage Books blurb on the back cover tells me; I can't seem to find any press releases that actually say which award[s] the book won), been made into a film, and been translated into almost as many languages as your favorite swear words. And yet the name is completely unfamiliar to the vast majority of the American book-buying public, even the mystery fans. Why is that? Because it's on Vintage, whose catalog is more \\"where we've been\\" than \\"what's hot today?\\" (The Vintage Crime backlist is littered with names like Jim Thompson, Patricia Highsmith, Raymind Chandler, and Dashiell Hammett; the only \\"now\\" author a modern-fiction-blindered fan is likely to recognize is Jonathan Lethem, whose mysteries are, shall we say, decidedly different from what one picks up when one goes for the newest Mysterious Press titles.) Is it because reading translated fiction is kind of like watching a subtitled movie to a certain kind of intellect? Is it because Vintage only gets stray pennies of Knopf's advertising budget? We may never know the answer to this, and other pressing, questions, but we can try to put things right.<br /><br />First off, if you're a mystery fan of whatever stripe, you should be buying the whole Vintage Crime catalog. Period. Pick up any random book with \\"Vintage Crime\\" on the spine and you're going to be well-rewarded. You'll either get a classic, like those mentioned above, something so far out of the mainstream you'd never have discovered it (like Lethem or the spit-funny mysteries of Joe R. Lansdale), or stuff from other countries that's good enough a bunch of people said \\"hey, why haven't we read an English translation of this guy yet?\\"Swedish writer Mankell falls into this last category. If you don't know anything about Swedish mysteries, just equate Sweden with Lapland. If you're really a mystery fan, the name Erik Skjodbaerg should come to mind immediately. (Skjoldbaerg wrote and directed one of the finest mystery films of the past thirty years in Insomnia. Forget the watered-down American crap you were spoon-fed a few years back and rent the original, if you haven't seen it.) Sidetracked is no Insomnia, but then, few things are. It's certainly good enough for what it is.<br /><br />What it is is a police procedural, kind of Giles Blunt crossed with Robert B. Parker with a lot more attention given to the weather and the World Cup. Wallander is awakened one morning close to Midsummer and sent out to a farmer's rape farm, where a girl of indeterminate age has been lurking. When Wallander gets there, she sets herself (and the farmer's crop) on fire. The next day, Wallander and his team are called in to investigate the murder and scalping of a former Minister of Justice. The bosses are hot to get the latter case wrapped up, while Wallander can't shake his interest in the former. Meanwhile, the department faces imminent cutbacks (a familiar refrain to American police-novel readers, no doubt), the World Cup is going on, and Wallander's trying to figure out both how to reconcile with his long-estranged father and balance a relationship (carried over from a previous novel in the series). There's quite a bit going on here, obviously.<br /><br />To make a long story short, the end result is that some things get lost in the mix. Notably, the relationship between Wallander and Baiba is almost nonexistent here, leading me to wonder if Mankell couldn't have just ignored it for the space of this novel, or relegated it to an even farther seat in the back than it already is. Also, the language stumbles at times, breaking the novel's pace (perhaps reading a translated novel really is like watching a subtitled movie). But still, overall, a very good mystery, and a worthy addition to the mighty Vintage Crime line. *** ½d come to mind immediately.

B000000WF0|5.0|I can't believe it took me this long to get into the Verve. Honestly, during the mid and late 1990's, I was still a young boy therefore was looking at foolish stuff on MTV such as Spice Girls and Take That. Now that I have matured, I can appreciate true and genuine music. And no album is more true and deeper than Urban Hymns.  <br />I easily give this album 5 stars. There are no filler tracks. Every song is genuine and crafted with professionalism and passion. And Ashcroft's voice sounds so honest and addictive. After this album, I instantly became a massive Verve fan.  <br />Buy this album, it will remain fresh and original in 30 years to come.  <br /> <br />Cheers
B0001XAPY2|5.0|If you look at a list of the greatest directors of all time, Fellini, Kubrick, Dreyer, Lumet, and Kurosawa are givens on any list. But for me Miyazaki stands out as one of (if not the best) directors of all time for his intense perfectionism that makes his movies so intracitley detailed and fresh, while at the same time retaining an air of nostalgia. \\"Porco Rosso\\" is one such film. Miyazaki takes the sleek Bogart-style anti-hero that changed cinema and applies it to an animated film made in the 90s. The result is the bizzare but wonderful story of a humanoid pig who runs from Mussolini's secret police while searching for bounties and the woman he loves. <br /> <br />       People rightly complain about how animation in Japan tends to focus only on stunning visuals and not story. Here we really get the best of both worlds. The scripting is top-notch, and the characters are great, but we get some excellent `performances' from the animated characters. This film features the best character animation since Tex Avery's cartoon shorts. Every character -down to the tiniest speck in the crowd- is animated believably. The animation is also remarkable during the heart-stopping flying sequences that make me wish the film had a theatrical release here in the states. Add the sweeping and majestic score by Jo Hisaishi and you've got one hell of a ride. <br /> <br />       This is one of the rare films where everything seems to add up perfectly from start to finish, which is rare for a film from any director no matter how great. Rent it now, but of course, skip the dub.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|We were very excited to see this movie due to all the good reviews we had heard.  But within minutes of starting the movie even my 8 year old son said 'this movie is so dumb'.  Being the adult I can further understand more of the nuances of the movie...but I still had to agree with my son!  It was way overdone and if the boring antics had been toned down there would have been much more humor in them.  But this was a monotonous and extremely boring movie that we only watched till the end because we couldn't believe that people we knew had actually liked it, and hoped that at some breaking moment it would dramatically change and actually BE funny.  It never did.
B00000FCBC|5.0|You know after listening to this CD and the new St. Anger, I sort of wish they would do a Bob Seger Greatest Hits... Metallica style. They really are a great cover band Since they left all their good original stuff in the 80's. I've been a Metallica fan since 1983, but alas... time has caught up with them. It was a great ride though.
0316172324|4.0|The reviews are mixed regarding this book.  I liked it.  I found it similar to MIND WIDE OPEN and THE TIPPING POINT.  It is a book about first impressions and how much accurate or inaccurate information can be relayed in the blink of an eye.  Unfortunately, I don't know how much we really understand first impressions and that \\"blink\\" moment.  Therefore, the author is left discussing research and impressions on what first impressions are all about.  There is little concrete information on the process itself.  In other words, I felt like I had a series of descriptions of what it was like but no complete image (much like the blind men describing the elephant).
B0007CNXUU|5.0|This is Johnny Depp at his best. I loved his wide-eyed innocence throughout the movie, from when he's peeking through a curtain to see the audience's reactions during one of his plays to when he's dressing up as pirates or indians to please the boys.  <br />Another exceptional actor is Freddie Highmore, playing Peter, who does an excellent job portraying the anger and confusion in his character.  <br />I think you need to have watched an early version of Peter Pan to understand the inside jokes of Finding Neverland, which I'm sure will cause a few snickers and some feelings of deja vu. <br />A lot of people told me this movie reminded them of their inner child, or the child they used to be. To me, this movie shows  how inncoent and fun life can be when you just look through the eyes of a child.
B000784WMW|5.0|My eldest sister brought this movie back from college years and years ago. I was 8 the first time I watched it, fell INSTANTLY in love with it, and in the 12 years since then, I have continued to be enthralled. Clarke and Dalton are the characters I think Bronte just might have envisioned as she wrote the book. Dalton is ruggedly handsome, but very distant; \\"you can never be sure whether he is in jest or earnest, pleased, or the contrary.\\" Clarke is the perfect \\"plain, Quakerish governess\\" with just the right amount of \\"firey indignation\\" and zest on the side.  I have seen many versions of Bronte's original work, but they dont come close to this one! I CANT WAIT for it to be on DVD!
B000003BF1|5.0|This is really the first album I ever remember seeing. My German uncles' and cousins' had it when I was Army Brat growing up in Germany 35 years ago. I had a C2 fx in a  motorcycle accident in 1980 and having these tunes running through my head made me realize how wonderful life is and truly strengthend my will to live after the emergency room docs  gave me less than a 1 % chance to survive. I remember being pumped full of morphine in the hospital and having the tune \\"Monkey Man\\" going through my head. \\"You cant always get what you want\\" helped comfort me after my right arm was permanently paralyzed in that wreck. This truly is a very personal album for me and a personal review, but I'll go ahead and post it. Face it, if you love the Stones I'm not telling you anything you don't know already about the quality of these tunes. I'll never tire listening to this and \\"Sticky Fingers\\".
B000002KIE|5.0|Never Mind the Bollocks perfectly articulated the frustration, rage, and dissatisfaction of the British working class with the establishment, a spirit quick to translate itself to strictly rock & roll terms. The Pistols paved the way for countless other bands to make similarly rebellious statements, but arguably none were as daring or effective. It's easy to see how the band's roaring energy, overwhelmingly snotty attitude, and Rotten's furious ranting sparked a musical revolution, and those qualities haven't diminished one bit over time. Never Mind the Bollocks is simply one of the greatest, most inspiring rock records of all time.
B00005JNPZ|4.0|I challenge anyone who sees this film not to feel better after seeing it.  I don't understand why the critics panned it so hard.  Will Smith was perfect and of course Kevin James.  Also Eva Mendes, god that woman can work a skirt!  Anyways this movie is great fun, go see it!!
B000002KBU|5.0|Sad, spare, and beautiful, Blue is the quintessential confessional singer/songwriter album. Forthright and poetic, Joni Mitchell's songs are raw nerves, tales of love and loss  etched with stunning complexity; even tracks like \\"All I Want,\\" \\"My Old Man,\\" and \\"Carey\\" -- the brightest, most hopeful moments on the record -- are darkened by bittersweet moments of sorrow and loneliness. At the same time that songs like \\"Little Green\\" and the title cut  raise the stakes of confessional folk-pop to new levels of honesty and openness, Mitchell's music moves beyond the constraints of acoustic folk into more intricate and diverse territory, setting the stage for the experimentation of her later work. Unrivaled in its intensity and insight, Blue remains a watershed.
B0006Z2LH4|2.0|So I couldn't wait for this movie to come out! I didn't know what to expect, I just couldn't wait to have another CUBE movie with 'traped' rooms (like the original). ACK! What did they do! Why!? one third of the movie is spent outside the cube. Very few clips were actually inside the cube! I wanted more Cube action than I did anything else! I require more cube- thus the name of the movie. More like \\"Cube- zero parts are inside\\". The special effects were not great... the acting- Oh please, put some feeling into it! The lines were bad. Just bad. They had me baffled. The end was a totaly WRONG and bad twist... Its like a love story except the girl hates the guy and suddenly loves him after he's 'missing' - for some reason... Some characters were SO corney. Do you know what.... no. The only reason I give this a 2 is  because the parts inside the cube had my attenchen a little. Characters don't last long, though. And there arn't many to start with... Characters inside the cube were not even developed. The math is basicly the same- except letters. Sad things. You don't watch the people inside figure anything out (correctly) Then the letters go away... This movie needs to get better like, yesterday.
0385474547|4.0|I enjoyed reading Achebe's \\"Things Fall Apart\\" because it shows examples of  <br /> <br />tribal life in Africa in contrast to the \\"civilized world\\" of English rule. The book shows  <br /> <br />how the English government along with the English missionaries fracture the Ibo tribe in  <br /> <br />England's quest to bring civilization to Africa. This is depicted in the way that Okonkwo,  <br /> <br />a member of the Ibo tribe, is affected and treated by the English government.  <br />  <br /> Imperialism by definition is the domination by one country of the political,  <br /> <br />economic, or cultural life of another region. Imperialism in the story is harmful to the Ibo  <br /> <br />people. In the story missionaries supported by the English government create a split in  <br /> <br />the foundations of the tribes beliefs. The white missionaries teach the Ibo people that  <br /> <br />there is only one god and that their tribal gods are false. As a result, the people are torn <br /> <br />between Christianity and their old beliefs. This causes a major fallout within the tribe. <br /> <br /> An example of how imperialism has harmed the Ibo people is when Reverend  <br /> <br />Smith is dismayed when the Tribe declares a child to be an evil spirit call ogbanje and  <br /> <br />mutilates the child to ward off the spirit. Reverend Smith unmasks the spirit and  <br /> <br />infuriates and insults the tribe which results in the death of one of Reverend Smith's  <br /> <br />followers.  The English missionary has passed his beliefs onto the Tribe. Another  <br /> <br />example of imperialism is when the English infiltrated the tribe by building churches and  <br /> <br />establishing trading posts throughout on the Ibo's land.  <br />
0156027321|4.0|I read Life of Pi as a free-read book in social studies. When I had first heard of the book a few months back, I thought it had a lot to do with the 3.1415926535 ad infinitum Pi mathematical symbol or the letter of the Greek alphabet Pi, and nothing to do with an Indian son of a zookeeper shipwrecked at sea Pi. I brought the book along with me on a vacation, and couldn't stop reading it. Being a 13-year-old girl, I have to admit that some parts of it were rather grotesque, including parts about cannibalism, vomiting extensively, and tigers' mouths dripping with meercat blood and meat. But other than that, Life of Pi was a novel that kept me turning its pages. Some parts of it were sad, some were downright funny, and most of it was food for thought. Some people I know who had also read Life of Pi said it got too boring in the middle, but I disagree. Life of Pi is similar to The Cay, however more philisophical. I thoroughly enjoyed reading Life of Pi, and hope you do as well.
B0002X314C|5.0|I bought this CD on listening to 2 tracks and was prepared to just enjoy those.  So many CD's are like that these days.  The music they put out to the public is the best they have on them and that is it.   <br /> <br />John Legend's Gift Lifted is well above and beyond that.  All the songs on this CD are great.  I enjoy it from beginning to end.  I've been listening to it for a solid week now straight and I've yet to tire of his voice and his music.  He is a very talented musician and I'd recommend him and his CD highly.   <br /> <br /> <br />
0385474547|4.0|In my opinion imperialism hurt the Ibo people. I think this for many reasons, one being it turned the Ibo people against each other. Anther reason is imperialsim totally destroyed there culture, the Ibo people now lived under worry about there religion and not as they had for many many years. <br />  An exaple is when okwonko was driven so far that he killed himself. Because his people were being ruined he went as far to kill himself.Another example is the fight between the Ibo people who wanted to stay a tribe and the Ibo people we wanted to go along with the imperialism and not fight it.  <br />  All and all imperialism in my mind a very negative spin on the Ibo people and other tribes. Although who knows what africa would be like today without imperialism, it had to happen evenually its just a human instict to improve and to get as much power u can get by taking advantage of others
B00005JNEI|1.0|Nice try Michael Moore! \\"There's no terrorist threat! We've been attacked, but that doesn't mean that there's a terrorist threat.\\" As if any intellegent human beings actutally believe that! Skip both Bowling for Columbine and this movie as they're both packed with Michael's lies. Watch something fun and exciting like the Blue Collar Comedy Tour DVD's. They're a heck of a lot more interesting the Moore's lies about the Republican party are.
B00070QXLI|3.0|Renee Zellweger was brave to sign onto this film.   <br /> <br />Reneez Zellweger was so concerned about making the sequel that she even rejected the first script.  The second script must have been good, but the director's cut was three hours long. The actors and actressed walked away, leaving the dilemma of what to cut to the editor. Who made a complete and total hash of it. <br /> <br />So many story-lines began in the beginning of the film that needed to be closed in the last hour, that, in the last thirty minutes, Renee's character is seen running from event to event at a dizzying pace.  Case in point is the lesbian affair that was well-publicized prior to the opening of the movie.  It comes down to a hasty peck and an 'okay?!' before Bridget runs off to her next hasty resolution moment.  Ditto for the famous fight scene redux, apologies to friends who left her hanging in Thailand, etc. <br /> <br />Renee Zellweger was brave to sign up for this film for another reason: the character of the novel is not in a likeable stage of life.  She is whiny, neurotic, unreasonable, unhappy, and unaware of her responsibility for her behavior until near the end of the film.  True to the novel, and true to life.  But it's hard to watch an unlikeable character for nearly two hours unless something else about her is likeable--beauty perhaps?  And once again, Zellweger was let down.  This time by the director of photography.  Who made a total hash of her. <br /> <br />I went back to Bridget 1 and checked out the lighting and set design.  Zellweger is nearly always found in a favorable background set of soft blues with touches of red and much indirect, magic lighting.  With precisely the same poundage on her, she manages to look beautiful. Compare this to Bridget 2.  Harsh lighting, lots of yellow tones, really atrocious focus on her midriff, which was never, once exposed in Bridget 1.   <br /> <br />Poor Renee.  I feel she took a great risk in making this movie, and the studio lether down.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JNEI|1.0|My friend Roger is my biggest democrat friend Roger insists that GW is Satan reincarnated and I am sure that's what he puts into his comments of his code (he even voted for Mondale)... maybe that's why he said I would like the movie...but I didn't.
0743454529|1.0|To deal with the moral issues around the concept of a child born specifically to save her sister's life the author takes the scenario to extremes.  She tries to cover all points of view by having a different character narrate each short chapter. This coupled with the timeline not being in order made for a bit of a confusing read.  This would be excusable if the story weren't so over the top. For example, the father is a fireman and during the one week the story takes place, he is rushing to a several fires per shift and even saves a young child from a burning house with seconds to go. Even for a NYC firefighter I think this would a bit over the top. Why doesn't he take a week's vacation during this crucial time? Then there is the brother, who is rebelling against his role or lack of one in the drama. His juvenile delinquency is so over the top and his turnaround too dramatic that it pushes the limits of reality again.  The worst is the mother however; she is extremely one-dimensional and is portrayed to be obsessed with being the perfect mother.  She never has any regrets about anything and is clueless about her other two kids. She makes a bit of a handy villain but she is totally unreal.  <br />Even all this could be forgivable except that the ending to soo ridiculous and such a let down.  The author wants to tackle the hard issues, but obviously she can't make a decision herself when the morals are fuzzy. Therefore she writes in an impossible tragedy and an impossible miracle for the final few pages of the book. What a total cop-out.  I thought the point of the book is that sometimes we have to make decisions where there are difficult choices and no good solutions. Luckily, deciding not to read this book should be relatively easy!  <br />
B0006J28KU|3.0|OK I am editing my review.  I will admit that when watching \\"Heat\\" for the second time, I was more impressed than with the first viewing.  Interestingly enough, part of the reason for this was, the second time, I watched the \\"original\\" (1 DVD) transfer which actually had superior sound quality (another classic example of trying to improve something and making it worse)!  Now, since this review is for the newer 2 DVD set, I suppose I should leave my \\"3 star\\" review - although the Amazon edit process won't allow me to change it, I would now give it a 4 if I could.<br /><br />Pacino and DeNiro's performances are better than I had first described.  Not as good as \\"Taxi Driver\\" or \\"Serpico\\", but good nonetheless.  And now that I could make out the dialogue, I \\"retract\\" my statement that the movie seemed somewhat disjointed.  The storyline was much more coherent and linear.<br /><br />However, I still don't care for the \\"meeting\\" between Pacino and DeNiro - the conversation is too contrived and the whole episode too unbelievable.  I guess the idea was to create a \\"respect\\" between the two that makes the ending of the movie \\"tougher\\", but that scene in the diner just doesn't work.  I mean, a top L.A detective sitting down with his prime target over coffee and talking about their dreams? C'mon. \\"Heat\\" fans can diss me if they please - you be the judge.<br /><br />And I still stand by my statement that Michael Mann's true masterpiece of this genre is \\"Thief\\", not withstanding the outstanding drama, action, suspense and special effects in \\"Heat\\".
B0002UXBD6|5.0|I sorry mr. cotton hell but i have to disagree with you. I bought this album in December and I didn't know if it was going to be as good as the others, but little did i know it was equal or even better than the many other green day albums. Green Day is and has been for quite some time, my favorite band. A heard the rumors that they had sold out, i would rather call it \\"getting better with age\\" contradicting Billie Joe Armstrong's words: \\"i'm not growing up, i'm just buring out.\\"<br /><br />To put it in simple terms: this is a great album everyone should own.
0440238609|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series, though I am certain I still don't completely grasps its intracies or the ultimate moral, if there is one.  May I caution religious readers that this book may pass a few boundaries, and though it is for young adult readers, it may be troublesome to young readers, more so than Harry Potter.  Some imagery left me thinking of nightmarish things, and I'm not religious or young.  This said, however, like Milton, I feel that everyone should read this series, for all the parallels it draws, all the metaphors it makes and all the feelings it stirs.  I'm very glad I read it, and I think that it will stick with me for some time.
B000683VI4|5.0|What a great story this movie told, and with actors who are virtual \\"no-names\\" except for James Garner.   The story is about status and love and how love transcends the arrogant pillars of status.  It is very well acted and wonderfully told.  It is full of great joy and tragedy, but the main message is love lasts forever.   The acting of young Ryan Gosling is especially impressive.  Go rent this movie right now!
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I gave this album five stars because I listen to it so much. The first song is amazing; the combination of vocals, orchestrated sounds, guitars, drums, and keyboards will just take your breath away. The second song, 'Wish I Had Angel' is perfect with it's backbeat. It actually fits. The rest of the cd is great, although I sometimes skip 'Creek Mary's Blood'. The only reason for this is because it's a mid-tempo song; I was eager to get the rest of the tracks! If you have never heard Nightwish, maybe that is the reason for the eagerness.  <br /> <br />You'll find the combination of sounds refreshing, especially if you've never heard Nightwish before. The guitar tone is MUCH improved; nearly perfect for the 'metal guitar'. Their last cds have a different guitar tone. I find the tone on 'Once' to be near perfect. <br /> <br />Great cd, I listen to it a lot. Essential for those in the 'goth/symphonic metal' zone.
B0006GAI6O|4.0|Richard Gere is not losing his acting spark, in fact he is getting better and better.  He works well with Jennifer Lopez, and even with a very weak supporting cast, the story still works.  Oh, let's not forget Susan Sarandon, who is alittle underused in the film. Her performance is OK, but she is capable of much more.  The message of the film is very good, that love and family and happiness are the most important things in life, but before family relations really work, both partners must be happy about themselves too.
B0000062GE|5.0|If you have been through a hard time once, well, I wish you would have had this album during that time. <br /> <br />But if you're like the rest of the human race and go through hard times more than once, get this cd! <br /> <br />It's not just 'hard times' or 'darkest days' or 'depressed' it's a great cd to listen to for when you're bummed or just upset.
0385474547|5.0|The book \\"Things Fall Apart\\" is about an African male's life and the struggles he encounters along the way. The main character in this book is Okonkwo. His village is called Ummuofia. In Okonkwo's village they have numerous celebrations. One of the celebrations is for funerals. At one of the funeral celebrations Okonkwo accidently murders some one, and is exiled for seven years. While Okonkwo was gone his village and other villages in that part of Africa fell into problems with the \\"white men\\". <br /> <br /> I would say that imperialism hurt the Africans because in a waay it split them up. Imperialism hurt the Africans because it split them up. The white men came in and converted some into christians. The ones that didn't convert turned against the ones that did. Another way it affected them in my opinion is when they built the church in the Evil Forrest. The Ibo people let them build the church there because they thought that the gods would dismantle it. When the church went untouched it made some Ibos question their beliefs,and their leaders. <br />  Overall I would give this book five stars, just for the simple fact that it was interesting. I'm the type of person that doesn't like to read anything,but this book kept me coming back evernight to read more. This book is a pretty quick easy read. The only obstacle is the complicated african names. The names are just like a foreign language the more you say it out loud the more natural it becomes. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002858YS|3.0|Don't get me wrong, this is a good debut and a fun cd. I bought this cd for Mr. Brightside. Not really my genre, so perhaps it deserves more than three stars. To those who love this cd, maybe I just need to listen to it more?
B00006LLNU|2.0|This CD was one of the biggest letdowns to me in recent memory. I absolutely love Aegitis Byrjun (their previous album) and found it to be one of the most moving, original recordings of the past decade.  <br /> <br />When I heard that Sigur Ros was following up with an album with no titles, no decipherable language, and an ambiguous title \\"()\\", I was expecting something amazing.... <br /> <br />... or at least up to par with Aegitis Byrjun. Well, sadly, it's nowhere close. The main problems with () is not with the lack of words or titles (as many seem to criticize as being pretentious), but with the unmemorable melodies, lack of diversity, and overall.... it's just boring! None of the tracks get above a tempo of \\"slow as hell\\" except track 8 (but by then, it's too late - we're already asleep). All of the songs sound way too similar in sound - nothing to differentiate one song from another. In Aegitis, there were different sounds (cello-bowed guitar, organ, harmonica, flutes, orchestra) and styles (hopeful, melancholy, angry, ethereal, etc) to each track. () just picks one... melancholy. And while they can be damn good at melancholy, this album just doesn't have a melody worth remembering. Each song bases off of a simple structure that slowly builds for 6 minutes and doesn't change anything other than volume. This could be cool if the simple structures were interesting (again, go back to Aegitis Byrjun), but they just aren't. A couple of tracks (3, 4) come close, but no cigar. <br /> <br />I really wish this were not a step in the wrong direction for Sigur Ros because they're one of those original and interesting bands that I want to love. I just can't bring myself to enjoy this album though. Sorry, guys. Here's hoping the next one is worth all the hype.
1401301010|4.0|I loved this book! Yes, it's heavy on the sex, drugs and rock and roll cliche, but written in such a way that I felt like I was literally along for the ride. Anthony is fearless, really shows his vulnerablity - who knew that one of the prolific rock stars of all time was insecure about his vocal talent?  <br /> <br />I've listened to the Chili Peppers since Freaky Styley and consider Blood Sugar Sex Majik one of the best CDs of all time.  <br />If you are a fan, or just curious, this book will fit the bill...
0060763280|5.0|If you know you can't do something, you're right. As a first step to wealth, you have to be positioned to at least try.  <br /> <br />This book analyzes the basic fundamental thoughts that rich people have as opposed to the thoughts commonly found in poor people. Perhaps the most important is: Rich people believe 'I create my life.' Poor people believe 'Life happens to me.' With some seventeen such talking points, Mr. Eker attempts to establish a mindset that allows the reader to understand what he needs to do and think to develop wealthy thoughts, wealthy habits.  <br /> <br />Finally the purchase of this book allows the reader to attend one of Mr. Ekers seminars on a space available basis at no charge.  <br />
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Review of the Theatrical Release:    It was poorly advertised. It failed at the boxoffice. Nobody I know has ever heard it mentioned...Yet, Users of the Internet Movie Database (imdb.com) rank the movie among the 100 greatest films ever made. The film has gained what many would call a \\"Cult Status\\" among it's viewers. It seemed that this film barely shook the box office, or for that matter, the nation, when it came into theaters near the start of the decade. A recent Director's Cut was released, adding a near half hour to the film, which, provoked my interest even more. Well, I wouldn't even say that. Prior to the releasing of the Director's Cut, I had never heard of such a film. I never knew it existed, and as I read the summary, I knew I had to see it. So, I did. I didn't get to see the Director's Cut, I honestly didn't want to, I wanted to examine this film from when it was first released. I knew the premise, something about a giant rabbit and the end of the world. Sounds right up my alley.    So, I went into the film with high expectations. A movie about a giant rabbit and the end of the world? And it's one of IMDb's top 100 films? It has to be good, with a premise so out there, and to be appreciated to the extent it would be given that honor, of course I went in with very high expectations. The opening shot of the film already raises a question. Donnie atop a cliff, appearing to be thrown from his bike. He lifts himself up, then smiles at the mountain tops in front of him. Already, the audience is confused. The movie takes place in 1988 in Middlesex, Virginia. Our main character is a troubled 16-Year Old who's recently refused to take a number of medications. At the moment, I was already disappointed. Yay, clichs. However, in a matter of less than twenty minutes, I found myself liking Donnie Darko's character to a very large extent.    Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the movie is the growing tension in every scene. You know something is going to go verywrong, even if it takes awhile. To see the characters develop around this growing tension, is what caused everything to have some sort of meaning. As little things were shown on screen, very minimal, I knew they had to mean something. I would hope this movie would not have thought I was stupid enough to either ignore them. Though, they were not too obvious either. I just have an eye for these things. Early in the film, Donnie awakens, and appears to be sleepwalking. He walks outside into his yard, where a grotesque bunny is waiting for him in the yard. He informs Donnie that the world will end in less than a month, it's presented in such a disturbing way that, well, you think the world is really going to end like this being is saying.    That's exactly what the film is though, terrifying. Is it scary? No. It's on a whole other level of emotion, one which penetrates you, and scares you in an emotional way. As the film continues, an apocalyptic tone is thrown all over it, with atmosphere that I have yet to see in any film. Underlining this film about the end of the world, the social commentary is dead on. It's a universal film, one that speaks of the corruption seen in our everyday society. Never have I been so disgusted to watch a rather common dance done by grade children. Once again, that's another element of the film. It's disgusting...But in a good way. Does that even make sense? The film needs to be looked at as if it were a 3D-Model. It needs to be watched numerous times for us to find meaning in it, even if that meaning is different to every single person that watches it. Everyone will see a different film. If you're looking for a End-Times Sci-Fi Thriller that will entertain you, look elsewhere. This is a film for those who want to analyze it, want to think about what they're seeing. Not saying that it is not entertaining, it's amazingly entertaining.    The film counts down the days until it's conclusion. Each day, the sun in the scene seems to be ab it dimmer, until it's completely pitch black. Never have I seen such creativity and imagination in a film, nor have I ever been so amazed by a piece of cinema. Dare I say I prefer this film over EOE? Dare I say that this film is the most amazing I have ever come across? I think I do. After the credits rolled, I was stricken with a feeling of sadness. It felt like it was ten seconds long. This film needs to be explored, and most importantly of all, remembered.    Review of the Director's Cut:    I gave the original release five stars, and is quite possibly my favorite film, right up there with EOE.    The Packaging:    Very good, honestly. The slip cover is a white image with Donnie's front and back as an example from the Philosophy of Time Travel. It's very attractive, and it's one of the few DVD slip covers I actually keep on the DVD. When you take it off, you get an even nicer cover. A very cool shot of Donnie with his axe, smiling into the camera. One of my favorite shots from the film, and with the dissapointment of the very ugly cover of the 2001 release, it's a sigh of relief. The discs are the same covers as the slip covers, which actually look very nice.    Special Features:    Very good. You get a very insightful, and funny, commentary with Richard Kelly and Kevin Smith. That alone is worth the money, and I see myself watching it again in the future. There is a very entertaining documentary on \\"The #1 Darko Fan\\" which is either a very funny parody, or a very sad true story. I have not looked up to see which one it is...There's a theatrical trailer, which is the Director's Cut trailer. The original trailer, man, I hate it so much. No wonder it did horrible at the box office. With a tagline such as \\"Dark, Darker, Darko\\" how do you expect to get viewers? There's also a documentary from the UK on the cult of Darko, which both provides a very cool look at the fans and Frank in alot of odd situations, that make it somehow creepy. Frank in a phonebooth? I don't know why, but was really odd.    Movie Picture:    The movie never did look very well. Colors run together, in some places there's white spots and glitches, nothing too special. It doesn't look bad, I would just expect more from a DVD from this century. Not sure if it's the way the film was shot, or just a bad DVD job.    Sound:    Very good. There's more background noise, easily noticed in class scenes and outside shots. Frank's voice never sounded so good, and pretty much everything is heard better than before.    Movie Review:    On one hand, the cut scenes added alot to the film, and made it pace alot better. It added awhole lot to Donnie himself, as we learn more about him and the people around him. On another hand, some scenes completely ruin the power the movie once had. I mean, I never thought such little changes could ruin an entire scene. In Donnie's famous scene with Cunningham, even the short segment with Jim running back and fourth in fast foward with slides in the background made the scene alittle less powerful. Some lines were even taken out! One of my favorite lines in the film, Frank saying \\"I'm so sorry...\\" to Donnie in the theater was ripped out. That made me so angry. I mean, if you know the meaning of the film, it's such an emotional statement. \\"I'm so sorry I have to put you through this. I'm so sorry you have to die. I'm so sorry I killed Gretchen..\\" The scene is dumbed down. Also, if the scenes with the books had been completely taken out, the film would be just as good, if not better as the original cut. They're so poorly done, I mean, just absolutely horrible. They come up on screen with very bad animation, and they are either cut too short and you can't read everything, or they fade so much with the background you can't make out the words. They're distractions. They take away from the previous and next scenes. Instead of just throwing in a cheap (Photoshop looking) book segment, why not reveal it some other way? Perhaps have a closeup of the bookitself being read by another? Or just leave it out compeltely. Half the fun of the first film was not knowing what was going on by the end. Now that's all gone. It seems like a mess....And what happened to the countdown scenes? Those really added to the film, and now the film loses a whole lot of it's suspense because of it.    The \\"Mad World\\" scene, which was my favorite scene in the entire film, is now ruined by an overlay of a chapter of the book. Ugh. It just makes me so angry that he would ruin such a beautiful scene just to put in information. The mood of the movie is gone, and so is the disturbing aspect the original cut had. However, I don't regret getting this. The special features and commentary are worth it alone, and me being such a fan, I will keep this no matter what I think of the new cut. The old one is only $10 anyway, I'll get it eventually. I just wish they would have put both cuts on the DVD, I mean, then I wouldn't be dissapointed at all...But oh well. You can't win them all. The film is still good, but not great. The first cut was near perfect, but now this one shows Kelly's first time glitches unlike before. Sometimes you shouldn't fix what isn't broken. In no way is Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut a bad film. It's a good film...But by comparison to the original cut, it just falls flat.    It's no longer a film that disturbs and intrigues you, but rather with a bad taste in your mouth. You felt as if you missed something, even if the film is longer. It's less constructed, and almost feels as if it's just a bunch of scenes thrown together with anything constant.      The Director's Cut gets Three and a Half stars, and the original gets five. I averaged it out to five, simply because I'll feel horrible otherwise.
B000002UAX|4.0|There are some very good songs on this album, such as, Back in the U.S.S.R., Dear Prudence, Ob-La-Di, Ob-la-da, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Birthday, Sexy Sadie, Helter Skelter, and Revolution 1. But some of the filler songs just don't cut it. For example, Why don't we do it in the road? has 10 words!!! You call that a song? But the good songs on this album make it great. Have you seen some of those kids reviews? They have to be joking!!! If not, I want to come to their houses and give them a sound spanking, like their parents would if they knew they were posting that crap on the internet!!! Peace, Love, Happiness.
B00005JNEW|3.0|i finally got to see this film recently&I thought it was done pretty good. some of the directing shots where a bit much in spots&the film ran into familiar territory with other football films.Texas Football no matter if it's Jr High/middle School,High School,College or Pros it's all taken very seriously.this film captured that.the talk back radio then was something else imagine that the callers of today? all very real&also the realitys of what goes down within a team&Expectations.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|This outing by the Pat Metheny group is a mixture of both new and old ideas.  As is noted on the CD cover the music contains some minimalistic ideas in the style of Steve Reich, the bands first recording under the Nonesuch label.  Oddly enough Reich also records for Nonesuch Records.  The PMG has used Reichian techniques before namely \\"Eighteen\\" and \\"As Falls Wichita...\\"  These are reminiscent of Reich's pulsing chords in pieces like \\"Music for Eighteen Musicians\\" and \\"Septet.\\"  This technique seem to be the glue that holds the whole thing together.  This often recures between sections as a bridge keeping the whole thing moving forward. <br /> <br />Metheny uses multiple guitar overlays (a new idea for them according to Pat although he used it for the recording of Reich's \\"Electric Counterpoint\\".)  This adds to the symphonic and full sound of the recording as mentioned by another reviewer. <br /> <br />This piece is its vast expanse is like traveling across the Hartland.  It never ceases to amaze and amuse.  My only disappointment is that some of the transitions from one section to another are a bit rough and not as smooth as they could be especially in Parts 2 and 3.  Overall this is a great ride.  I hope that the concerts will produce a DVD of this work. <br /> <br />The musicianship is outstanding.  All of the members of the group are given a chance to show there musical prowess.  Even the side men are allowed to solo this time around.  The members are Pat and long time cohort Lyle Mays on keyboards (amazing solos), Steve Rodby bass, Mexican drummer Antonio Sanchez (superb playing here), Vietnamese trumpeter Coung Vu (excellent soloing and background support), and the Swiss-born harmonica virtuoso Gregoire Maret (a great new addition).  Richard Bona is also on board providing vocals and percussion.   <br /> <br />You have to check this one out!!! <br />

076780421X|1.0|All positive reviews must be wrtten by 12 year old girls.  This movie is uniquely, unspeakable mindless and horrible.  Don't  be misled.  It's truly, truly, uniquely and profoundly terrible.  Don't waste your money.

B000022TSW|5.0|I don't know exactly what it is about South Park that renders me near sick with laughter but I have managed to extract three consistant themes.<br /><br /> First of all, in a world of over concern about languauge and address, PC analysis and anxiety; anything, anyone and any topic is fair game for a right royal ripping apart here.<br /><br /> Secondly, there is something about the intoxicating regression at finding vulgar, sick humour so deliciously addictive, just like these very naughty boys do (and if we are honest, just as we did in childhood).<br /><br /> Finally, the fact that the main characters manage to be at once, cute, sweet and adorable while being utterly obnoxious and twisted.<br /><br /> It's schoolroom toilet, naughtily sick humour and it's addictive because we soooo should not like it.<br /><br /> I recommend this film but cannot honestly say I have seen it in it's entirity as I never get through it without missing large portions of it and needing oxygen/hysteria breaks, frequently!.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|I just bought & watched this movie I received this weekend, was scary, suspense, and great movie, scrip was real good. REALLY FREAKY IN THE END AHHH, U WOULD NEVER THINK THAT... I gives a 5 stars, great ADUIO 6.1 DTS sound, really enjoyed it .BUY IT.  DON'T MISS IT!!!.
0385486804|5.0|<br /> <br /> Into the Wild is a story of Chris McCandless and his adventures across North America. Chris despises his family for good reason and one day after college he decides he is just going to take off across the country with nothing but the bare essentials. He meets all sorts of interesting people such as Ronald Franz and Wayne Westerberg. Chris is a free spirit and never stays put for more than a month or so. He carries only a small backpack and hitchhikes all over the west side of the Untied States. Everyone that met Chris would say he was really a smart nice young man. Chris liked people but couldn't stand mainstream America. After traveling all over the west he decides it is time to head north to Alaska. He wants to live off the land and just be alone in the woods away from everything and everyone. Four months after Chris heads into the Alaskan back woods moose hunters find his decomposing body... <br /> This book I thought was a tale of a very brave man living off the land against the elements. Jon Krakauer did a great job of keeping the reader enticed. I couldn't set the book down. Jon had such good description of Chris' adventures that t made me feel like I was there with him. This book inspired me to want to go on a great journey across America. It sounded like so much excitement. I loved this book and I would suggest it to anyone that loves going on adventures.  <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|As fate would have it, I, like others before me, was not popular in school.  High school was a pretty dismal experience, and don't get me started on junior high!  Santa Maria!!!! NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE brings to the big screen the experiences and misadventures of the epitome of misfit-dom--the title character (a curly-headed, coke-bottle glasses-adorned outcast played by Jon Heder).  This guy is really like no one I have ever seen.<br /><br />Napolean  is a young man who lives with his grandmother and 32 year old brother in a small town in Idaho.  His days consist of feeding their llama, seeking out odd jobs (they include working in a chicken farm, hearding the creatures into cages and analyzing glasses of milk to determine what the cows consumed before they were milked), and just trying to survive the ups and downs (mostly downs) of high school life.  Napolean encounters fellow geek Pedro (Efren Ramirez), recently uprooted from his native Mexico, and helps him run for class president.  Napolean also encounters Deb (Tina Majorino), a shy aspiring glamor shot photographer, who becomes his friend.<br /><br />This film is filled with a kind of humor best-described as \\"off the wall\\" and \\"subtle\\" (to say the least).  In fact, when I started watching it, I really wasn't sure if it was really going to appeal to my tastes (though, I try to keep an open mind and enjoy independent films).  Some of the most well known phrases from this film have been oft-quoted in the media, as of late (\\"I caught you a nice sea bass,\\" \\"Gosh!\\" and \\"Idiot!\\").  You have to see the film to begin to understand the context.....stick with it and you will enjoy this unusual, upbeat and affirmative journey about outsiders finding solace in each other's company and realizing their own potential through self determination (and Napolean's secret weapon...of course....)
B00003CXB2|5.0|Lawrence is an all around spectacular film, and the 2 disc set is a must have in any serious film collection.  A few of the attention span lacking slack jaws out there may not enjoy the film since it has a cohesive  story and there are no boobies or \\"rel good killins\\", but for those of us literate enough to read this review, and intelligent enough to install a lightbulb without the written instructions, then there is no finer , grander, or more magnificent film out there than \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\"
B0002XDODU|3.0|hmm.. i looked forward to this cd for months after hearing it was coming out, then it finally did and i was so excited. Much to my suprise, i liked 2 songs on the cd and thought the rest was garbage. about 3 months later i've given it another listen, and i like it a little better now. It still isn't the Rammstein we all know and love, but there is always hope for another classic cd** stick to that straight hard drum beat guys...that's your sound.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Fair warning: This is easily the most affecting movie I've seen all year.  You know those little packets of Kleenex at the check-out stand? Not going to cut it. Maybe the travel-size box will do. I'm sorry if this review is more vague than usual but I don't want to say too much because, in this instance, anyone who spoils the ending for you is an absolute boor.<br /><br />'Finding Neverland' explores the relationships in the life J. M. Barrie that inspired his masterwork, 'Peter Pan.' But it goes beyond the mere workings of creativity. It actually becomes a celebration of imagination itself and the day-to-day hope and comfort that can be fashioned by it.<br /><br />Johnny Depp actually gets out of the way of the character and Kate Winslet does her usual excellent period piece work. Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman have important parts (Even if a bit distracting. I mean just how many women had obvious facelifts in the early 1900s?). But the most impressive actor by far in this picture is then-nine-year-old Freddie Highmore as Winslet's son, Peter. He brings immediacy and honesty to a role that the movie hinges upon and will probably leave the most lasting impression on viewers.<br /><br />Though the film has its flaws and a few \\"misunderstood artist\\" cliches, its vision eventually rises effortlessly above them, much like the Darling children when they also think of a wonderful thought.<br /><br />The penultimate scene is beyond description. On paper it would sound awfully simple. But the thoughtfulness, joy, longing, and healing in that one elegant, emotionally explosive moment is one of the most powerful and profound that I've ever experienced.<br /><br />I don't hand out praise like that very often. But 'Finding Neverland' earned it.
B00005JLEX|5.0|When the first three seasons of Seinfeld were released in November of 2004, it was quite possibly one of the most anticipated television on DVD releases ever. The four stars had all come to terms to be a part of the DVD production and fans were excited about seeing one of the funniest sitcoms of all time on DVD after a long wait.<br /><br />I for one, was not at all disappointed.<br /><br />I wasn't quite old enough to appreciate Seinfeld in the first few years but grew to love the show as I went off to college and beyond. The normal everyday life that these people lived showed just how funny things can be, even what seem to be mundane things.<br /><br />I found the first two seasons (five episodes in season one, 13 in season two) to be quite entertaining. The four characters were just beginning to find their chemistry, but you could tell it would be something that would come together relatively quickly.<br /><br />I found it interesting that the pilot episode was so much different than the rest of the show. To start with, there was no Elaine. The female character was a waitress named Claire, played by Lee Garlington, who has had small roles in many different shows including Everwood and Friends. In addition, Kramer wasn't Kramer, but was Kessler. And he had a dog, which was never seen again. In the 'Inside Look' section, it is mentioned why the dog appeared. The story is kind of interesting.<br /><br />Probably my favorite episode of the first two seasons was 'The Chinese Restaurant.' I don't think a show had ever done anything like that, with three characters just standing around waiting for a table. It was unique, but certainly something that almost everybody does and can relate to. The only bad part about the episode was that Kramer wasn't a part of it.<br /><br />While the episodes enough would have been plenty of incentive for me to purchase the DVD set, the extras on this set are fantastic. The bonus features include  'notes about nothing' which are production notes and behind the scenes notes, the aforementioned 'Inside Look' where viewers can take a look inside many of the episodes through the characters, creator, writers or others involved in the production. There are also commentaries from Jerry Seinfeld, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, Jason Alexander, Michael Richards, creator Larry David and even from one of the writers. These provide a lot of great information. There are also deleted scenes and a piece on the creation of the show.<br /><br />It is hard to believe that this show, which went on to be one of the top-rated shows on television, almost didn't survive the first year. Low ratings were to blame, but NBC held on and gave it another shot and reaped the benefits for years to come. Now only if networks could do that these days with fine shows that don't get immediate ratings and get axed.<br /><br />This set is a well-done piece and is worth purchasing for anyone who is a fan of the show or even just a fan of good sitcoms.

B000002UJQ|5.0|My favorite bands are Dire Straits, Led Zep, Jethro Tull and Pink Floyd. I rarely listened to anything else and had given up on the 90s music. Till I heard 'OK Computer'. <br /> <br />This is, without a doubt, one of the greatest albums ever. There are very few albums in the 90s that even come close to the genius of OK Computer. Listening to this was like listening to 'Dark side of the Moon' for the first time. I never thought an album could sound like this and still be so great. There are no great guitar riffs, vocals or any of the usual ingredients of an 'epic' album. I guess thats what most people don't get and end up not liking the album. Keyboards are a major part of the music in this album... but its done so well. A bit like Brian Eno (think Achtung Baby). Amazing combination of beauty and sadness.
068987474X|4.0|this book does not give all the scenerios that we women experience on a day by day basis but some of the stuff that was shared by the authors are humorous. a lot of it is denial by the women.  <br /> <br />when it all comes down to it, if a guy is into you, he would find the time to call and talk to you. when he loses interest and runs away, he does not want to catch his tail between his legs so therefore, it just means he's just not into you. <br /> <br />very interesting and very entertaining.
B00005JMJG|5.0|\\"Eternal Sunshine\\" examines the relationship between two very different people (played by Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey) and how it is turned upside down when the woman in the partnership decides she doesn't like the way things are going and decides to erase all memories of her past lover. She knows about a doctor who has the ability to remove selective memory and she undergoes the procedure without telling her former lover. When he discovers what she did, he decides to do the same thing himself and relives the moments they shared together. He then wants to stop the procedure, but it may be too late.<br /><br />This movie has received much critical acclaim and for good reason. It is one of the more original movies I have watched in a long time and it is completely unpredictable. It keeps you guessing and guessing, all the way to the end. Some parts don't even make sense at first, but everything comes together when the movie concludes. It's a thinking type of movie. It makes you think about your own relationships and how important they are to you. Even though disagreements will occur, we often don't realize what we have until it's gone, which is what this movie illustrates.<br /><br />With this type of basis for a plot, this movie is one of the more unusual I have seen in a long time. The sequences in this movie are not always chronological and they require your complete attention. Some viewers might even need a second viewing to fully understand what is taking place. The film is surreal, with many of the action taking place while Jim Carrey is in a state of half- consciousness. He is fully aware, in his head, of what is happening and he wants to bring it all to an end once he realizes how much he loves his mate. But in order to stop the procedure, he has to wake up and this isn't likely to happen with this type pf procedure.<br /><br />Many veterans of movie watching will appreciate this film for its originality and for its fine performances. Others will feel it makes no sense and dislike it completely. I fit into the former category. Parts of this movie are a little slow, but its overall storyline and its lack of predictability make this a must- see motion picture.no sense and dislike it completely.

B00005LC1H|4.0|Although Fawlty Towers was a low-budget British TV comedy program that was inexplicably cancelled after a few episodes, it had excellent writing and funny scripts.
B000003S09|5.0|This album starts out with absolute sxxx kicking rock that ends up in an excellent out of tune scratching like someone scratching their fingernails on the blackboard and then goes into such a refined fusion of vocalism & music.I still say that you are listening to rock,jazz,blues & classical musical that is all performed there at the same time.The contrast from 21st Century Schizoid Man to beautiful vocalism of Greg Lake & the amazing musical backing in I Talk To The Wind is overwhelming.I believe that Greg Lake was 19 years of age when he sang this.Who says that 19 year old white men cannot perform classic jazz recording?Sarah Vaughan & Carmen McRae I am sure have heard this but never attemped it because they just couldn't pull it off.The lyrics,phrasing musical backing of Epitaph is timeless,unpresidented & unsurpassed and goes into transendentalism,life after death,like in the poetry of Emerson or Emily Dickinson.The only thing that comes close to Epitaph is the song Gloomy Sunday sung by Sarah Vaughan on the syndicate Roulette label.For Moonchild the first half is extrodinary but just blip it with the remote control after the vocalism because the rest of the song is just not there;and besides you go directly into the title song Court Of The Crimson King which sounds like a super super Moody Blues tune where at the end they take a short ciragettte break and come back stronger than ever with the beautiful vocal harmony & fantastic drumbing.Don't put this on if you are depressed or suisidal.This is not something to listen to everyday.Put this one in your collection while it is still around;you won't be sorry.

B000007NYS|4.0|Often critics catch up with an artist long after they've been doing great stuff and usually, they refuse to admit that they missed the earlier albums.  Instead they assert that somehow the artist has suddenly become much better than before. Call it human nature or cowardice. Either way, that's what happened with Ms. Williams because this album shows she was writing fabulous songs long before Car Wheels on a Gravel Road.<br /><br />This eponymous CD was her first venture out of folk.  And what a venture it was.  Almost all of these songs have been subsequently covered by other people over the years. Why? Because some of them are amazingly good. A couple of them are incredible.<br /><br />In a lot of ways, the high points on this CD are much better than the high points on Car Wheels. And since I'm inclined to value an artist on their best songs rather than the overall quality of the CD, I'd say this is a better album than the one the critics raved about.<br /><br />Some people don't like this CD because it has a stronger country flavor than her more recent releases. That's just prejudice against country music - the \\"if it has twang it must be dumb\\" phenomenon. And it's probably true that one of the reasons that Ms. Williams is less country sounding now is that she's acceded to that prejudice. People can't get past labels. That's their problem.<br /><br />The production on this album isn't the best. Her vocals, then as now, are simply passable. But the same can be said for Dylan's albums too. And a few of these songs are on Dylan's level. Things don't get any better than this.
B000002UA0|5.0|I'am a die hard Pink Floyd fan, I can never get sick of thier music. This album is much different from the later Pink FLoyd, but is still brilliant. Anyone who says Syd Barrett sucks is an idiot. IF it wasnt for Syd Barrett, The Floyd would have never made it in the music buisness.  <br /> <br />1.Astronomy Domine-8/10 A great track, but not the best. <br /> <br />2.Lucifer Sam-9/10 Amazing song, great vocals <br /> <br />3.Matilda Mother-10/10 Possibly the best song on the album! <br /> <br />4.Flaming-10/10 Great song about one of Syd crazy LSD trips... <br /> <br />5.Pow R. Toc H-6/10 Cool song...but can get strange at times. <br /> <br />6.Take up thy Stethoscope and run-5/10 Worst song on the album, big disapointment to Roger Water's first song. <br /> <br />7.Instellar Overdrive-7/10 cool guitar riff, fun! <br /> <br />8.The Gnome-10/10 Great song, catchy. <br /> <br />9.Chaptor 24-10/10 AWSOME! The ending is mind blowing. <br /> <br />10.Scarecrow-10/10 Short and sweet, one of there early singles. <br /> <br />11.Bike-10000/10!!! This song rocks, anyone who doesn't like can go die. Its catchy, fun, and brilliant. Garunteed to get stuck in your head for WEEKS!  <br /> <br /> Overall this album rocks. But can you beleive that the original US version of this album didnt have Bike on it? They had \\"See Emily Play\\" and \\"Arnold Layne\\" instead. I mean...they are both great songs...but i would never trade Emily or Arnold for Bike. anyday.
B0000017CA|5.0|I've never bothered to write a review for a CD on Amazon before, partially because I've never had the ambition, but mostly because I know nobody will care what I have to say anyway. However in this instance I feel it is my civic duty to expound on the absolute brilliance of this collection of 14 songs. <br /> <br />I picked this disc up on a whim from a seedy, hole-in-the-wall record store about 6 or 7 years ago. I'd heard the name \\"Acid Bath\\" floating around and the J.W. Gacy artwork caught my eye as I thumbed through the metal bin. For 10 bucks, I figured, I might as well. I was 16 and had nothing better to spend my money on. Little did I know at the time I'd be making the most worthwhile music purchase of my life. <br /> <br />Anything I can say in an internet review of the content of this album is a travesty, and couldn't come close to doing it justice. The only thing I can think to say is that I had never before and have never since heard a selection of music crafted so flawlessly (outside of Mozart). There is not a single low point, not a single moment throughout the course of this CD that I would even consider skipping or passing by. <br /> <br />Raw and polished, discordant and harmonious, When The Kite String Pops runs the gamut in all forms of sonic genius. It demands attention and respect from the listener (and a little chemical assistance doesn't hurt), but the reward is an incredible musical experience. Completely flawless.
B00005JMUA|1.0|I noticed that Kill Bill was recommended to me by whatever powers there be at Amazon because -- among other things -- I had purchased a Polder Cooking Thermometer.  I'm not sure how the two relate, unless it is recommended that Bill be cooked to a certain temperature after he is killed.  My recommendation is to forget the movie and buy the thermometer.  It is a great kitchen tool.
6300248569|5.0|Firstly I'd like to say that some seem to be under the misaprehension that the Colin Firth version was made by A&E, that is not so they only provided money, it was made like this earlier version by the BBC and shown in six weekly installments. I do come from London by the way. <br /> <br />Now to this the 1980 version which I've watched again today, for about the millionth time. Both versions are good but this is definitely the one I prefer, I think every actor performs better even Darcy. Although Colin Firth is more attractive, Darcy is written as proud and arrogant and that's exactly how David Rintoul played him, yes he was stiff, but that's how he was written. Elizabeth Garvie is fabulous as Eliza, just as I imagine her to be bright, intelligent with a wonderful sense of irony. I never enjoyed Jennifer Ehle's performance and I thought she was too curvacious to be Lizzie, who I'd always thought of as petite. <br /> <br />Alison Steadman's OTT portrayal of Mrs Bennet in the 1995 version was appalling, and I usually admire her as an actress, Priscilla Morgan got it just right, silly but not a caricature performance. <br /> <br />True if one wants a Romance Movie you would go for the 1995 version because of all the additional scenes that are not in the book, as lovely it was to see Darcy swimming I don't know where they dragged it up from, certainly not from Miss Austen. Also they definitely expanded Miss Darcy's part from what was written in the book, and as wonderful as my favourite scene from the later version of Elizabeth playing the piano at Pemberley and then assisting Georgiana was, it didn't happen! <br /> <br />This version that was produced by Fay Weldon was filmed as a TV show, hence there was not the cinema quality of the later version which was filmed as a movie. I personally don't think that detracts at all, I loved Elizabeth's thoughts being spoken and the smaller set gave it a book like feel. <br /> <br />I do agree the ending was abrupt, I was disappointed, actually I've been disappointed with all the endings, I would love to see a version where Lizzie and Darcy are writing their various letters to their relations telling them of their upcoming marriage as in the book, but you can't have everything I guess.

B0001UL7RY|5.0|To date this is the end of February. I bought Avril Lavigne's \\"Under My Skin\\" CD 8 months ago and it has been my favorite CD by far. I was never a HUGE fan of Avril, I just liked some of her songs. But as soon as I heard \\"Don't Tell Me\\" on the radio, I immediately fell in love with it and knew I had to get the CD. And as soon as I got the CD, I fell in love with it as well. To this day, I still listen to her album all the time and I absolutely love it. Even though her songs are a bit cliched and lyrically not the best, IT SOUNDS GREAT!!!!!! All the songs on the album sound amazing and I can relate to each and every one. I can't name my favorite song on the album because my favorite songs change from time to time because I love them all so much, I pick a different favorite all the time. They can all be my favorite. This album is far better than \\"Let Go\\", which was pretty good. But NOTHING, no other album can compare to this one. I think every girl should own this album because it deals with so many different aspects of life, a girls life in general. As soon as I heard this CD, I knew I wouldn't get sick of it. I knew I would love it for a very long time. If I love a CD, this long, I may love it for life. This CD deals with breakups, uncomfortable relationships, heartache, death, fun and free spirit, things all girls go through in their life and it is reassuring that all these things are on one amazing album. I give props for Avril and I thank her for making such a marvelous, amazing, enjoyable CD! Luv ya Avril and keep up the amazing work!!!! Mwah!
B000063WDH|4.0|OK, I'm biased. I dig the hell out of this group and bemoan the fact I live in coastal carolina, as I'll probably never get the chance to see them play live. This was the first thing I picked up by them and I ain't looked back! These dudes got the blues! Yeah! As far as these kindsa things go- what you're lookin at here: it leans on the bluesy side of things.<br /><br />Compared to their later CDs (they're averaging about one per year and they just get better n better!), the sound on this is pretty straightforward and untinkered with- the fairly lo-fi style of production and recording really suits them nice. Compared to their 2nd release, the guitar has less chunky distortion, and more squawky clean tone, well-controlled. The post-production isn't as deep as later stuff. More skeletal sound. Now then, if you're a hardcore blues aficionado, you may wonder what the fuss is all about. This isn't Live on Maxwell Street, nor is it J.B. Hutto. It's pretty much invigorated, stripped down blues rock, done damn well. More precision, less chaos. Not 5 stars, but definitely 4. Each song sounds distinctive, which makes this standout against a lot of other recent dirty-blues/garage-rock fare.<br /><br />Some of the reviewers have complained about the obvious recycling of blues/early rock motifs... the riffs and lyrical content. Samples: \\"you ain't gonna run. me down. anymore...\\" \\"try to make you mine...\\" \\"I'll be your man...\\" \\"won't you come around...\\" \\"Hey darlin, let's do the rump...\\" \\"Hey, hey, hey, I still love you so...\\" \\"Hey, can't you see me cryin...\\" ...Lot's of hey this and hey that. So they ain't reinventing the wheel. Well, to my mind, that's kind of the point. I wasn't expecting these guys to be Mallarme or Rimbaud. The lyrics aren't there to change your perspective on life, just to cling to and reinforce the over-all blues aesthetic. Dan Auerbach does some of the best white boy blues singin and hollerin I've heard in some time. The man's got some great mimetic skill. Patrick Carney locks into place and does what good backup men always do- provide an environment for the leader to showcase his abilities. These guys really click.  The solos are skeletal and effusive, again- I like 'em! Not so blazing out of control, as tight and angular. So, don't expect Jimi or Stevie Ray or Albert King to be channeled.<br /><br />Stand out Tracks: \\"The Breaks\\" (great tune, great lick, just kills me every time). \\"Them Eyes\\" (possibly my fave: the most unabashedly rock n roll, the bridge chords are a simple but timeless garage-rock assault- the song then segues into some even-paced and soulful crooning wit a change of mic. LOVE this one!!). \\"Heavy Soul\\" (it's got that opening riff that damn near everyone and their grandma has copped a bit, from Hound Dog Taylor to The White Stripes) \\"I'll Be Your Man\\" (sounds very haunted and CCR ((at least to these ears))- that's a good thing, it's got that early Fogerty swagger, that marching beat, \\"Yearnin\\" also rocks a similar approach)<br /><br />My only beef: Not enough tracks. And they're too short. That's actually probably a good thing. and \\"240 Years\\" stops about 1.5 minutes into it and has 20+ minutes of dead silence before some stuff comes back in.<br /><br />Great all-purpose music. Recommended!

0375432302|4.0|It's amazing how much stuff you can do in just one night in Europe. Assassination, secret societies, car chases, airplanes hijacked and flying all over the place, great misteries. After all, this book is good fun. There is nothing really serious about it, although every little element of the plot refers to specific legends or conspiration theories. The fact is that they are nicely tied together and, for the reader, enjoyment is guaranteed.

158799190X|5.0|On Wall Street and in life, people make two big mistakes. They think there is always a reason other than randomness that the winners come out on top. And they undervalue the albeit remote likelihood of catastrophic setbacks. A great book by a delightfully cranky author.
0441172717|5.0|I've read this book twice, with about ten years in between. I liked it even better the second time - - I believe that was because I was in a better position to ponder the intricacies of the plot, which is incredibly involved, in both time and space. I sometimes think it was Frank Herbert's vision of a galactic empire that was the inspiration behind the Galactic Republic in the Star Wars movies and novels.    Of course, the star of this novel of conflict and war is the desert planet Arrakis itself, or Dune, where giant sand worms roam the desert and make the invaluable spice melange that makes it possible for the giant space craft of the Spacing Guild to travel between the stars by folding space. The spice melange, which also turns the whites of your eyes blue, is what everybody is fighting about. And on Arrakis, water is worth gold too, can power an army, and is being secretly hoarded by the Fremen, the native desert people of Arrakis, who are also waiting for their messiah to lead them to freedom.     The ideas and concepts behind this story are simply mind boggling. So rich are the characters and elements in the plot that it has never been equaled: the secret order of the Ben Gesserit, the evil Harkonnens and their even worse leader Baron Vladimir, the Spacing Guild that controls intersteller travel, the Emperor and his fanatic Saudaukar troopers, the boy messiah Paul Atreides, his father Duke Leto Atreides, the all-blue-eyed desert Fremen of Dune, the Dune planetary ecologist Pardot Kynes, the sand worms, and more.    I can nitpick, however. I've always thought that the author needed to do some work to present the beginning of the story better. The beginning reader has simply no idea of the richness of the universe that will shortly unfold, and can get somewhat lost and confused in the beginning, which is why it's a book that can be read twice. I remember the first time I read it that I was tempted to give up on it after the second chapter, because I was quite confused, even alienated. I continued, however, because I had been warned in advance that this might happen, and I'm now passing the warning on.    My only other nitpick is about the atomic weapons Paul and the Fremen use in the big battle at the end of the story. For the life of me, I've never been able to figure out how they got their hands on nuclear weapons, which require extensive industrial processing to make; there was no sign of any such plant among the Fremen. But this is probably just a minor plot flaw, of no significance to this magnificent story. The book is a classic that will endure forever.
B00005V9HH|3.0|\\"The Usual Suspects\\" is a fascinating, convoluted, frustrating, remarkable, confusing mess of a movie.  Its incredibly complex plot is fascinating; the plot is convoluted, frequently going in a number of directions at the same time, leaving holes in the plot and gaps that are too often frustrating; is remarkable because its ending ties up the most troublesome of these; but is confusing because it leaves other questions unanswered.  Ultimately it's a case of buckshot cinema; it sprays all kinds of ideas, clues, red herrings, and misdirection, and doesn't play fair with the audience in that it drops clues and later pretends they didn't exist.  It cheats you.    Oh, not that it's boring.  Not in the least.  \\"The Usual Suspects\\" is equal parts film noir, Agatha Christie murder mystery, and \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" wannabe without the great dialogue.  The film won an Oscar for best screenplay and another for Kevin Spacey's \\"supporting actor\\" role.  Spacey's award was well deserved; the cheating screenplay wasn't.  Check out the physically impossible moments such as putting out a fire in the film's early moments and, later, blood spattering in the wrong direction in an elevator.  Another sin committed here is the showbiz idiocy of an actor firing a handgun while holding it sideways; ask anyone familiar with handgun marksmanship and he/she will tell you that's a sure way to miss your target nearly every time.  Stupid.  Finally, and worst of all, a key character at film's end whose name is revealed as being made up on the spot even though the writers, in the previous scene, show the character's name in court records from the previous day.  Wha?    Personally I don't like being lied to, and the screenplay goes beyond misdirection to out-and-out ripping you off.  Unfair.  Perhaps a more gullible (or less attentive) viewer won't notice.  It's telling that screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie has only had one other screenplay produced in the 10 years since this film was made (2000's \\"TheWay Of the Gun\\").    It's worth a look, though, partly because of how well and stylishly the finished production cheats on you.  Obviously it got away with it, for most people.  Also, continuing the obvious parallels to \\"Reservoir Dogs,\\" this film is far more stunning in terms of cinematography, obviously a higher budget film (I can hear McQuarrie and director Bryan Singer, who were high school buds, pitching this film to prospective producers:  \\"It's an upscale 'Reservoir Dogs' with a bigger twist at the end,\\" which is essentially what it is).  Also, the cast cannot be faulted, in spite of one actor who thinks he's Marlon Brando with a worse mushmouth than usual.  (Perhaps it's the character who thinks that.)  Any film with Spacey sharing extended screen time with Chazz Palmanteri is worth three stars for that alone, and Kevin Pollak & Gabriel Byrne are bonuses.  One question:  How did Stephen Baldwin sink from this to \\"The Surreal Life\\"?    \\"The Usual Suspects,\\" ultimately, is more frustrating than most films because of how good it could have been.  A little more attention to detail and a little less disingenuousness would have resulted in a far, far more satisfying finished product.  Another reviewer for Amazon asks if this is the perfect film, and the answer is, \\"Far from it, but many of the elements are there.\\"  If you want to see the nearest thing to cinematic perfection, go back and watch \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" or \\"Local Hero.\\"

0316172324|4.0|What made The Tipping Point a wonderful book is back on display in Blink. At the same time, what made it unsatisfying is too. Gladwell is a gifted writer whose sentences have the straightforward brilliance of E. B. White's or Calvin Trillin's. He has a generous, curious spirit. He loves understanding why people do what they do. It's as if he goes through life with his notebook open, genuinely eager to learn about the people he meets. The stories that he tells in Blink are fascinating. The way, for instance, that little clues can tip off the careful observer that two newlyweds have a very high likelihood of divorce. And did I mention that he writes like an angel? But Blink is frustrating in much the same way that The Tipping Point is. Gladwell doesn't tie up all his stories into a clean thesis. Are snap judgments good or bad? Can anybody learn to do them, or just trained experts? Well? Most of the people who bought The Tipping Point were looking for a how-to book that would show them how to create tipping points for their own businesses. Unfortunately for them, that's not what Gladwell was trying to do. He's a great writer, whose mtier is reporting.
044024157X|4.0|It seems to me that how you rate this unusual Grisham story depends on what kind of story you are judging it as. It you judge it  as a fast-paced legal thriller, it's worth only two or three stars. But if you judge it as a historical story of small town life in the deep south, three decades ago, in which most things that happen are very ordinary, except for some events connected to a sensational murder/rape case, then you give it four or five stars. (Since legal thrillers make more money than small town stories, and the publisher is promoting the thriller angle, I'm wondering why the publisher didn't just insist on another legal thriller. Maybe the publisher is so afraid to loose such a lucrative author that he or she just has to publish anything he writes, and Grisham just felt like writing this one.) <br /> <br />The story is not very complicated. In the early 70s, Willie Traynor, after doing poorly at university up north, buys the struggling local newspaper in Clanton, Miss., and spends the next nine years struggling to build its circulation. And as he does so, writing about events in the region, we get to understand the social set up in the deep south in the 70s, with all its race problems. I have never lived in the south, and found his account quite interesting. <br /> <br />The sensational events, related in about a third of the book, involve a brutal rape murder by Danny Padgitt, no-good son of a dubious but wealthy Padgitt clan, whose stronghold is in a river peninsula near the Tennessee state line. Danny is convicted, and goes to jail swearing revenge on the jurors, one of which is an older black woman, Callie Ruffin. Callie is from the other side of the tracks in Clanton, but has unusually successful children, except for one wayward son. Willie covers the story of the murder in detail, in spite of threats from the Padgitt clan. He also becomes a friend of Callie, and uses his newspaper to inform the white community of how smart her children are, and how well they're doing. But nine years later, when a corrupt lawyer gets Danny out of jail, jurors start getting killed, and Callie's life is in danger .... <br /> <br />The writing is very good, and the book is pleasant to read, if slow. I just finished reading the Star Wars Epic \\"Labyrinth of Evil\\", and compared with that it's a snail's pace. It's certainly no legal thriller either, but it has a charm all of it's own. I figure it's worth the average of 2-3 stars for a thriller and 4-5 stars for an interesting small town story about a part of the country I know little about. That works out to 3.5 stars, so I'll give it four stars. <br />
B00005JN4O|4.0|J.M. Barrie would have been proud of the filmmakers of Finding Neverland. Not only does the cast do an outstanding job, but director Marc Forster expertly directs this movie with strength. <br /> <br />The two best performences were Johnny Depp and Freddy Highmore. Johnny Depp never makes me say \\"He's so bad!\\". But Mr. Highmore is going to make it in Tinseltown. He gave a wonderful performence in Two Brothers, and now I can't wait for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Awesome movie.

Unfortunately the heroine of this novel isn't as witty or quirky as Becky. <br />In the first few pages it was evident that she really isn't that into her significant other, her cringing when she has to call him \\"darling,\\" so I felt irritated by the characters screw ups and lack of common sense. <br />Some funny moments, but not as speedy of a ready as Kinsella's other books.
015670160X|4.0|Oh, what a romp this is! When Virginia Woolf isn't feeling sorry for herself, she can be a delight. Don't read this book as a treatise on sexual identity or societal roles. Woolf describes the book as a biography, and that's what it is. Orlando makes his (then her) way through the world, trying to make sense of it and, from time to time, trying to fit in. It wreaks havoc with your love life when you don't age over the centuries (just ask Anne Rice's vampires). But it does give you perspective, and that is why we read.
B0006J28KU|2.0|If you're thinking about buying this 2 disc version to get a better DVD picture transfer; don't bother. I couldn't tell a difference from the original release, which is good but could be much better.<br /><br />Only buy this if you're interested in the special features.
B0000399WC|5.0|When this movie was released, McQueen was back like a bullitt in superstardom from his last hit, The Getaway. He SHOULD HAVE won the Oscar for this role. Dustin Hoffman was a star, but for a couple of years he had not had a knock-out role and was beginning to look like the peak of his quirky popularity was over. Hoffman did get the Oscar for best supporting actor, although the size of his role is more in the best actor realm. Academy Awards aside, the two actors have great charisma and their respective characters' friendship is sincere and well-developed. Team-ups of two big stars for your money was popular at this time and the McQueen/Hoffman pairing is surprisingly effective. This is crucial to the success of the movie, but several other ingredients make it quite an extraordinary film.    The cinematography is gorgeous, capturing the tropical locations with big, sky-filled scenes. Many angles give a sense of Hitchcock, using various architecture to create mood. The score is excellent: subdued, haunting, and nostalgic. The credits at the end of the film with pictures of the abandoned Devil's Island prison add to Papillon's sense of triumph over adversity. And finally, there is the story itself.    Certainly this should have an Oscar for best adapted screenplay.  I was thankful to be spared the 5 year solitary confinement of Papillon after enduring the 2 year sentence in detail. McQueen is truly the \\"Cooler King\\" from just the episode in solitary.  How can you entertain and show a man in solitary confinement? McQueen and Schaffner succeed in this tough assignment brilliantly. Papillon is not for everyone. If you want an adventure movie that lets you think and reflect, then you will treasure it. This is probably the last great performance of Steve McQueen in his all too brief career. Some people compare Kevin Costner to him, but I would say if you want to see his successor, watch Mel Gibson. Gibson shares much of McQueen's physical mannerisms and facial expressions.I'm not saying he's as good, but there is a great similarity. Just imagine Steve McQueen doing \\"Payback\\" and you'll realize not much would change.     The DVD is in a sharp case, but it doesn't have enough extras for such an outstanding film. Certainly there are some deleted scenes hanging around somewhere? OK, Dustin, this film was pivotal to your reaching superstar status, so give back. Just add an audio commentary and I'll be satisfied.
0385474547|4.0|<br /> In the book Things Fall Apart, by Chinua Archebe, imperialism greatly affects the Ibo people of southern Africa.  Imperialism of southern Africa hurt the Ibo people because it changed their ways when they didn't need change.   <br /> Imperialism hurt the Ibo people for three main reasons.  First, when the Ibo people had a strong religion of their own, Christians came and converted some of the tribe.  This then, turned the converted people against the others causing outbreaks.  Next, the white men slaughtered a neighboring village of the Ibo using \\"iron horses.\\"  This brought the Ibo people to fear that wasn't necessary.  Finally, the main character, Okonkwo, was banned from his village after a gun accident.  If the white people had not introduced guns to the Ibos, this wouldn't have happened.     <br /> Overall, when the European people imperialized Africa, the ruined the perfectly good lives of perfectly good people.  They treated the Africans like they weren't people and ruined their lives for sport.  This imperialism shouldn't have happened and many innocent people were hurt or killed because of it. <br />
B0006IIPIK|3.0|First, this movie is beautiful to watch. The way it was filmed is stunning and the special effects are amazing. The story itself harkens back to the days of the pulp science fiction novels and the old movie serials where the plots got more outlandish as the story went along. With all of this I was anxious to see the movie, but it ultimately disappoints. Some of the scenes are poorly set-up and the dialog is very bad at times. Gwyneth Paltrow is terrible as the female lead. This has more to do with the material than her abilities, but it's bad nonetheless. I found her character to be shrill and irritating and couldn't wait for her to be off the screen during her scenes. More time needed to be spent on the story and especially the interactions between characters. Special effects this good are one thing, but they can't make up for a script that is lacking.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|What I love about Hayao Miyazaki films is that the stories are completely unpredictable. If you see a twisted character and assume that they are the villain you will most likely find out you're wrong towards the end of the film. Miyazaki doesn't follow any formulas when making his films. There doesn't have to be a love story. There doesn't have to be a good guy or bad guy. But in all his films there is this imaginative journey you're taken on and you become swept up in these worlds Miyazaki has created for you. 'Nausicaa' is just one more example of why Miyazaki is the greatest when it comes to animated films.
0064471837|5.0|I read this book, including the other two that follows, it is a great adventurous story.
0553260111|5.0|having read the Bourne trilogy some years ago the two movies recently made based on the Bourne Identity seemed somehow unfamiliar to me so, I've just re-read the entire trilogy and find absolutely no parallel in the films to the Ludlum stories... <br />The plots and subplots of the books make these exiting, can't put them down reading. Even Van Lustbarger does an excellent job in re-creating the Bourne character. <br />I just wonder where these movie makers come from to change an entire story to fill their alloted time. <br />You who have read the books will recall that Alex Conklin was Bourne's best friend, appearing in all three of the Ludlum books, yet he is killed in the first movie...sad to say that I won't be going to see \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" if they decide to make a movie of it. <br />Read the books, they are excellent.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|This was a very good movie. It is stylish, which is a trademark of Michael Mann's, and has good performances by Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise. Foxx proves he can really act and Cruise makes a believable sociopath. Cruise is a hired killer in L.A. for one night to kill 5 people and he hires Foxx's taxi to take him from place to place. An unfortunate event at the first murder makes Foxx an unwilling accomplice. There is a lot of psychological warfare going on from Cruise's character and eventually Foxx begins to fight back. This is a good thriller with an intelligent script and good actors creating good characters. My only problem would be a little bit of a contrived ending but then again maybe I'm thinking too much and I should just shut up and enjoy the movie.

B000000OU0|5.0|I never thought that the Eagles would bring their '70s rock to 1994, when grunge bands dominated the charts and harder beats of rap were common. While I like those genres, I thought about the Eagles, since I remember songs like Hotel California.  They sound in fine form in their acoustic versions of these hits.  Don Henley and Glenn Frey and the underrated Timothy B. Schmitt sound superb in their lead singing.  The other band members sounded good in their music sections.    They do it exactly like it is on the records!  Proof that they have their own stamp over their music. The three studio songs that they did in 1994 sound good, though Learn To Be Still sounds a little bland from them. Love Will Keep Us Alive, I still like a good 10-11 yrs. later! And I like the attitude laden, politically driven Get Over It! If it true that the band is recording a new album, it will be another classic and sell millions of CDs!  But for a band to take a 14-year break and come back like this is unheard of.  They won several awards with this album and toured again.  They are one of the best American bands to still consistently perform today!
B00005JNBQ|3.0|\\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" is one of those \\"comedies\\" that only really works for you if: a)You unconditionally accept the unique universe that the characters live in; b)You're so tired of Hollywood's current crop of assembly line drivel that you will instantly embrace anything (no matter how poorly produced, directed and/or written) that dares to be \\"different\\"; c) You are currently addicted to prescription painkillers; d) you can think of nothing more imaginative to do with your spare time than scouting out any posted review that gives the film less than five stars and then pouncing on the \\"unhelpful\\" button with self-satisfied smugness; or e) All of the above. The episodic adventures of Idahoan supernerd Napoleon and his somewhat lobotomized family and friends have obviously divided the armchair critics into two distinct \\"loved it!\\"/\\"hated it!\\" camps. If the idea of David Lynch directing an episode of \\"Leave It To Beaver\\" is your cup of tea, you will definitely get some chuckles out of this one. I'll give them some points for trying. It ain't \\"Duck Soup\\", but I can think of less amusing ways to spend 90 minutes.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|This movie is TERRIBLE.  For a movie with so much action, it's actually BORING.

Who the hell finances these dumb pictures?

B00028HBKM|2.0|I was expecting the second coming with this movie, the way that everyone was pushing it on me.  I wasn't impressed by the story line.  It was more depressing to watch a man get beat up, moreso than a representation of the Christ.  The movie was more based on a 19th century nun's account (this has been publicly acknowledged by Gibson himself) than on the Biblical account of the four gospels, which was disturbing to me.  I was sympathetic to the character, as the violence against him was hard to watch, but it was just a movie role. I could not see the character as more than an actor in a movie role, even though many people almost associate the man in the movie with the historical Christ. Also, I sympathized with the mother, and shed a tear for her in her grief.  I was a bit taken aback by the insinuation of anti-semitism in the movie, though.   <br /> <br />I didn't think the movie was as earth-shattering as some make it out to be, but rather saw it on its own merits, to which I agree with the critics - this is a Mel Gibson vision of what possibly might have gone on during the crucifixion of the Christ, rather than a historic account.  I took on this merit, rather than being starstruck by either Gibson, nor Christ's story. <br /> <br />The movie is more depressing than life-changing or encouraging. Gibson could have emphasized a passionate hope and positive aspects of what the Christ died for, but chose instead to show a more violent, depressing view of what he envisions it must have been like.  Gibson is entitled to his views, but since no one was there, it is only Gibson's view and not a historically or traditionally accurate depiction of the crucifixion. <br />
B00028HBKM|5.0|I saw \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" and I think it is one of the most powerful films ever made. The use of the visions of the Catholic mystic Anne Catherine Emmerich only add to the account written down in the Gospels. If you go in to watch with an open mind and leave whatever agenda you have, pro or con, at the door then you are in for the experience of a lifetime. <br /> <br />As for all the hand-wringing over the violence of the film most of that criticism comes from the arch-hypocrites of academia and the movie industry who managed to sit through \\"Schindler's List\\", \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and \\"Friday the 13th part MMMCCCCLLL\\" without batting an eyelash. But suddenly when it comes to \\"The Passion\\" they're all a bunch of shrinking violets.  <br /> <br />Also, I do not think the film is anti-semitic any more than \\"Training Day\\" is anti-black. Are there Jewish villains in the story, yes. Are there Jewish heros in the story, also yes. If any group comes out of the film with a black eye it's the Romans. The fact is that Christ's story is fundamentally a Jewish story ergo most of the major characters, for good or ill, are going to be Jewish.  <br /> <br />Having said all that I believe \\"The Passion\\" is a brilliant piece of filmmaking. It shows us in unapologetic yet artistic images the depths of the suffering and degradation that Christ endured for our salvation. No collection of great works is complete without it.
B000683VI4|5.0|I saw The Notebook in the movie theatre and I will say that there was not a dry eye to be seen.  Young, old, women and men were trying to choke back their tears in the silence of the room.  After buying the classic love story, I felt free & safe in the privacy of my own home to just *let it go* and let the tears fall as they may. I went to work the next day with swollen eyes, but my soul felt cleansed.<br /><br />The Notebook is filled with beautiful images & scenery of South Carolina which will have you pondering this destination for your next vacation.  You will laugh. You will cry.  You will learn the true meaning of love.

0451526015|4.0|An interesing and confusing novel. A book I actually enjoyed reading. I don't like to read much, except for the occassional magazine article from Rolling Stone. The book made me want to keep reading. The beginning isn't very good, to me anyways, but it does help you get into the book. There are \\"third-person\\" sections that can get pretty confusing, so i suggest folling along. Since it was written in 1891, there is a little Olde-English, but not nearly as much as Othello,by Shakespeare, and not to much to where you don't understand it. One last thing- don't get the urge to skip a page in the beginning, because you will be completely thrown off.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Though this movie is a bit more than the typical bs you watch on tv, it doesn't really tell us all of the truth either. <br /> <br />Moore just ripped off parts of what Alex Jones does. Alex Jones is the original reporter who uncovers the whole new world order and all the conspiracies related to it. For example you don't see Moore talking about how the pentagon was hit by something other than a plane and how the WTC and Oaklahoma buildings had more to their demolitions than the public is aware of. Those are the things that really matter.  <br /> <br />When Moore was asked by Alex Jones himself why he does not talk about any of the new worlder order issues, Moore said \\"it's unAmerican\\". So It's unAmerican to talk about the truth? I guess it's only \\"patriotic\\" if you remain ignorant about reality and do not question anything. <br /> <br />Unlike Moore, Alex Jones is not in it for the money. He clearly states you can copy his films all you want.
0743424425|5.0|Trapped in a hotel with a sickening past, the Torrances must face a fear greater than fear itself.  The Shining is a tale of a hotel and its horrific history, from murders to live hedge animals you believe you are hallucinating but that are really waiting to tear you limb from limb. <br /> Fired from his job as a teacher for abusing a student, Jack Torrance, a recovering alcoholic, wishes to get a new start and continue his writing career.  He still needs a job, and he finds one as winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel in Colorado.  Due to the harsh weather in the winter, Jack, his wife Wendy, and son Danny must live at the hotel without any outside contact.  Little do they know what is waiting for them inside of the hotel, or in room 217 specifically. <br /> Stephen King was inspired to write The Shining when he  visited the Stanley Hotel in Colorado.  The Stanley Hotel was known as haunted, with the most ghostly activity in room 418.  The entire fourth floor of the hotel, which was formerly the servants quarters, is said to be quite active.  The sounds of children playing in the halls of the Stanley Hotel can be heard even when no children are present.  <br /> The title The Shining is a contradictory representation to the contents of the story.  The sun is know to be a symbol of \\"light and warmth, renewed life and life everlasting.\\"  One the contrary, the hotel is a concentration of perpetual death and suffering.  This is why the term \\"shining\\" is the name of the gift that Danny possesses; a power which will defeat the likes of those the hotel possesses. <br /> Danny Torrence is a five year-old boy who experiences precognition through an invisible friend named Tony and blackouts.  Tony is both a malignant and benevolent figure as he shows Danny both evil and benign things, such as where some of Danny's family's possessions are after they move. Danny is also able to understand many things without being told, such as how his mother and father both had thoughts andfeelings of DIVORCE, whereas his mother's were more simple and his father's more complex, \\"colored dark violet and shot through with frightening veins of pure black.\\"  In the Overlook, Danny is the one who first sees the true past of the Overlook from the blood and gore on the walls of the Presidential Suite.  Danny's gift (or curse, as some may say) is what the Overlook is really after.  The series of events that Danny must go through in order to persevere the effects of the Overlook is truly a captivating tale. <br /> The hotel itself is an interesting character, an antagonist of a spiritual form and able to read minds and find out the fears of the people it wishes and use those fears to control their minds.   The hotel is also very quick in mentality with a cynical sense of humor.  The hotel is haunted and is slowly possessing Danny's father, driving him mad and to become homicidal.  A rising amount of terror is given from the hotel which is at first thought to be hallucinations, but when the hallucinations become deadly (, no one can save the Torrences except for themselves. <br /> The scheme of events allows you to connect things before the plot unravels or the characters figure it out themselves.  Also, you believe you have connection with something when in actuality there is no link.  Binds the reader into a tale so enthralling that it is impossible for them to put the book down.  A tension builds where you are afraid yet yearning to know what happens next. <br /> The Shining is by far one of Stephen King's best works.  The reader is engulfed in the novel and feels as though they are a part of the story.  It was truly a captivating story that I enjoyed greatly.   The quest by Danny for the true and terrifying meaning of \\"redrum\\" will have you baffled until the simple yet terrible solution is attained.  If you are a fan of Stephen King or any horror novels, The Shining is one book you don't want to pass by.
0385510454|1.0|Mr. Grisham says that when his testy 13-year-old word processor breaks down, he may stop writing.  His writing seems to be as precarious as his word processor these days.  I read hundreds of books, but don't review them.  When I do, it is usually because I have enjoyed a book so very much and hope to inspire others to read it.  In this case, I'm hoping to save Grisham fans and possible purchasers some money.<br /><br />Mr. Grisham said he gained ten pounds while \\"researching\\" this book.  No wonder!  A good 30% of the first half of the book is about food, Cappuccino, food, more food, espresso and...food.  The Italian words for a multitude of foods; how to order food in Italian; how to order Cappu with one sugar, two sugars, milk; what the food ingredients are; the times of day to drink Cappu vs. espresso; how the food is prepared, (truffles shaved); even the ambience in which it is served, and how that affects the food; what was eaten and drunk at each meal for weeks.  Somewhere in the background of this food fest, a plot of meager means is developing.<br /><br />Can you say \\"Pass the salt?\\" in Italian?  You still won't be able to after you read this book, but you will be nauseous from the veritable cornucopia of Italian dishes that are offered up for our \\"consumption\\" as we read this drab novel.<br /><br />Does Grisham get paid by the page? That is the only reason I can think of that he would use so much fill.<br /><br />Then there is even more fill as we trip through architecture and history  while the main character (Marco) walks and walks, then ultimately dodges and darts through the Vias and alleys of Bologna and--unlike Grisham--loses weight while doing so.  This weight loss is loosely woven into the story, albeit Marco's appearance has now changed.  But no matter how much this character clips, dyes, or shaves, no matter how many times he changes clothes, no matter how many times he even changes his briefcase and shoes(much was said about shoes!) no matter how much weight he loses, he is still immediately recognizable time and again by any one of five different assassination teams.<br /><br />And guess what?  He does a little tap dance across continents, makes a few phone calls, sets up a meeting with one or two people, and by golly he's in the clear!  Not only that, Grisham gives us indigestion when we learn that his leading character is going to get back on that plane and go back to his beloved Bologna to see about cooking something up with his Italian-language tutor, who also helped him with one of his many ineffective disguises.<br /><br />I'm rooting for the word processor to burn out before Mr. Grisham decides he wants to set a book in Paris.l immediately recognizable time and again by any one of five different assassination teams.

B0002VEWA6|5.0|An outstanding animated romantic comedy, Shrek, brings to the screen the love story between, an ogre (Shrek), and a beautiful princess (Fiona), with all the ups and downs that that entails!  In addition, the couple finds itself in the company of adorable characters from classic fairy tales, with the cherry on the cake being the hilarious talking donkey. <br />It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.   <br />Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation does come ALIVE)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.   <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the HUMOR (!!!) and the music are all wonderful! <br />In short, Shrek is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  Strongly recommended along with Shrek 2. <br />
0385474547|4.0|Throughout most of \\"Things Fall Apart\\" Achebe describes the many traditions, rituals, and everyday happenings that occur in the villages of Ummuofia.  For instance yams are of very high importance in the village, they even have yam festivals.  Some of their beliefs seem strange, such as the belief in digging up a stone to cure an ogbanje, a dead child who returns to the other to be reborn.  Others seem to coincide with our own laws, such as punishment for murder and distinction between murder and manslaughter.  The main character, Okonkwo, accidentally commits murder and so he and his family are banished from the clan for seven years.  After his banishment the \\"white men\\" come to his village.  They are Christians who come with churches to try and convert the \\"heathens\\", but they also come with guns.   <br /> <br /> While the beginning of the book focused mainly on the many rituals of the clan, its was still quite interesting to read.  Many of their ways seemed to coincide with ours.  The way to treat iba, the fever, was to use medicinal steam and today the same idea is used in Vicks humidifiers.  Of course other remedies seem stranger, like digging up a rock to cure constant miscarriage, which surprisingly worked.  It seemed the whole beginning half of the book was to slowly pull you into the story and have you feel you were part of the village.  Around the fifteenth chapter the book begins to talk about the \\"white men\\" and the attempts the early church made to gain followers.  This was the most exciting part of the book, especially the unrest in the villages building up until the people find that they must determine what to do now. <br /> <br /> Outside of the book I would immediately say that imperialism hurt the Africans.  However \\"Things Fall Apart\\" seems to portray other sides of imperealism.  The District Commisioner and his aides seem as mean and horrible as you would expect them to be.  Yet the missionaries seem much more .  For instance Mr. Kiaga accepts osu, or outcasts, into the church and Mr. Brown sat with villagers to learn about their Gods and traditions.  Even when the villagers assaulted some of the converts, the missionaries told them to be patient and not fight back.  Aside from the ultimate suicide of Okonkwo, imperialism overall helped the people of Ibo.
B000001EAQ|4.0|I was about 13 or 14 years old at the time Pop was released, which was around the same time I was first getting into rock music.  I distinctly remember being turned off by the ridiculous hype this album received, and even though I had never heard any of U2's music, I decided I didn't like them (I was young and shallow).<br /><br />While it's true that the marketing of Pop was grossly overdone (but was that the point U2 were trying to make- the ridiculousness of over-saturation?  If so, they sure shot themselves in the foot), after I started listening to U2 and got around to listening to this album, I sure liked what I heard.<br /><br />\\"Discoth&egrave;que\\" kicks things off, and while it's a great, high-energy song, I prefer the alternate version available on the Best of '90-'00 disc, which is harder rocking and has a more prominent rhythm section.  The pseudo-dance song \\"Do You Feel Loved\\" is reminiscent of U2's hit-or-miss Zooropa album, while \\"If God Will Send His Angels,\\" \\"Gone\\" and \\"Staring at the Sun\\" have more of a \\"classic,\\" '80's U2 sound to them.  \\"The Playboy Mansion\\" is has a nice lighthearted feel, and drummer Larry Mullen Jr. rules \\"Please.\\"<br /><br />The best song on the album is the dissonant and (dare I say it) techno-like \\"Mofo,\\" which might very well be the most daring song in the U2 catalogue.  A close second is \\"Last Night on Earth,\\" which sounds ripped straight from Achtung Baby.  I also like \\"If You Wear That Velvet Dress,\\" which Bono described quite accurately as a \\"lounge classic.\\"  His voice is just incredible here.<br /><br />Lyrically, the most prominent theme is the mockery of pop culture, which surrounded everything having to do with this album, from the tour right down to the title.  \\"The Playboy Mansion\\" is incredibly blunt about this (the lyrics are the focus of that song, not the music).  \\"Discoth&egrave;que\\" includes the great line chorus,  \\"You know you're chewing bubble gum/You know what that is but you still want some/You just can't get enough of that lovey-dovey stuff,\\" which is the inevitable submission to pop culture that seemed to foreshadow U2's commercially safe next album, All That You Can't Leave Behind (luckily, it was a masterpiece, so I'd hold back on the \\"sellout\\" accusations).  Also notable is \\"Wake Up Dead Man,\\" the only song with overtly spiritual themes.<br /><br />Fortunately, the debacle of Pop has been all but forgotten due to U2's massive success with later albums, so now you can listen to it free of its marketing.  Pop is by no means as accessible as albums like Achtung Baby or All That You Can't Leave Behind, and I wouldn't recommend it be the first U2 record you buy, but it's definitely a worthy and unique entry into their catalogue.an't get enough of that lovey-dovey stuff,\\" which is the inevitable submission to pop culture that seemed to foreshadow U2's commercially safe next album, All That You Can't Leave Behind (luckily, it was a masterpiece, so I'd hold back on the \\"sellout\\" accusations).

B00005JMUA|5.0|Visually, Kill Bill Vol. 1 was spectacular. The fighting sequences were not only imaginative, but stunning. Vol. 1 was almost non-stop carnage, and little dialogue. The real, snappy dialogue that Tarantino has used to make his movies, particularly Pulp Fiction, worth watching a dozen times was missing.  Vol 2 gets the balance right, containing all the best qualities of any of Tarantino's masterpieces. It's inhabited by surreal people casually saying outrageous things that should curl your hair. David Caradine, the former soft-spoken, confrontation avoiding Kane of Kung Fu, is riveting as the homicidal maniac Bill. No doubt, Caradine's sinister, blood-thirsty Bill is so startling because we cannot entirely displace the gentle Kane from our minds. Still, Tarantino included in both volumes material that should have landed on the cutting room floor. With a little discipline, Tarantino could have made a one volume movie masterpiece.
B0006SLDW0|5.0|Kamelot, one of today's leading melodic metal bands, never cease to amaze me.  I more or less knew The Black Halo was going to be a splendid album, but I honestly did not believe it could top Epica, which is what I consider to be more or less a perfect album.  Well my friends, I must say it - they have topped Epica!  Is it believable?  Not until you hear the album. ;-)    Starting off with March Of Mephisto, we're taken into new territory.  From the overall strong Eastern feel to the impressive orchestrations, this song is quite a treat.  Granted, Kamelot have certainly produced Eastern-influenced melodies and orchestrations before, but never have they done so to the level that they are present here.    To spare you, the reader, I am not about to go into a song-by-song review, as it would be more like a novella than a review.  What I would like to say, however, is that this is what I would consider to be Kamelot's strongest effort yet.  The songs are just flawless, truly.  I admit, as a reviewer, I sometimes use words like \\"flawless\\" and \\"perfect\\" a bit too liberally, however, I really mean it this time around.  I cannot find fault here.  Every song is strong enough to stand on its two feet, which is a rare find.  The subtle, yet impressive, instrumentation adds an entire new dimension to the songs that simply could not be delivered by any other band outside of Kamelot.  I am also glad to say that Kamelot still are very-culture friendly.  Taking and utilizing influences from a variety of cultures, such as the Japanese flare in Moonlight to the wonderful prelude to the title-track, we hear a great variety here, to say the least.    Being fortunate enough to have the Japanese version, I'd like to point out the Japanese bonus track, Epilogue.  While the other bonus track, a radio edit version of Soul Society is enjoyable, and features a different take on the song, the bonus track Epilogue really is a treat.  Despite that Epilogue is labeled with the degrading \\"bonus track\\" stamp, I personally feel that this piece of music completes the album.  Although the band has stated that it was specifically written for the Japanese version, and has no significance to the story, it really ties the album together.  If you've got the means, I'd definitely recommend the Japanese for this beautiful song.    What else can I say?  This is going to be one of my favorites albums of 2005, and rightfully so.  It is rare that an album comes out with this level of beauty and power, but here it is.  If you're a new listener of Kamelot, this is a great place to start, although Epica may be a better introduction, at least for the sake of the story as The Black Halo is a sequel to Epica.  For those that are Kamelot fans, you will NOT be disappointed!  Cheers!
0792160347|4.0|Hi I was just wondering if anyone knows the song that is playing in the backround that he is singing when he's deciding which Armani suit to wear. It's not on the soundtrack so if anyone knows it I'd realllllyyy appreciate it if you e-mailed it to dollface10288@aol.com under the subject AMERICAN GIGOLO...thanks!
B000000OAN|5.0|Ah. What could i say where could i begin? So much to say that's been said a thousand times before. The year was 1975. Queen had released 3 previous albums, ranging from good to amazing. They had done everything - classic rock, hard rock, metal, punk-esque, ragtime, caribean, comedic, operetic, poppy, ballady, and quite frankly all of it was extremely experiemental and worked beautifuly. Where did queen have to go with all the expirimentation they had done on previous albums? <br /> <br />somewhere good. <br /> <br />Where Queen found all their creativity I doubt we'll ever know. Freddie mercury was really a genius musician. He excelled at piano and songwriting. The magnitude of his voice goes without saying, as it is in my opinion possibly the greatest voice of all time. He could do anything vocally as this album would prove. One problem that bands with superpowers like Freddie always face is that every other member or the band will be overshadowed or just quite frankly not good. Oh, but that was not Queen. Brian may, while certainly not the greatest guitarist ever, was still amazingly good. Some of the most creative and signature riffs out there. John deacon often gets overlooked but his bass playing is really top notch and his  songwriting were also very good. Roger taylor was the glue that held the band together as good a drummer as anyone could hope to meet. He even lent a hand singing every now and then when he felt like it. <br /> <br />Oh. I seem to have drifted off the subject. If you don't feel like it ignore those paragraphs above 'cause they weren't really important. I suppose I'll give the songs on this cd a rating. <br /> <br /> <br />1. Death on Two Legs - Freddie sure knew how to open an album. classical sounding piano riff leads into a total excess of noise and pure guitar fury which is on the very brink of exploding. Then back to a lovely piano riff and some sweet brian may guitar lickage. The lyrics in this song are first rate. A furious stab at the band's previous producer. honestly this song will be one of your favorites. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />2. Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon - Absolutely ridiculous! Freddie Mercury was insane. The kick A$$ loud \\"Death on Two Legs\\" segues right into this super campy and fun piece. It's piano based and then finishes with an amazing three-part guitar solo. It's just so fun and you'll love singing along. Great contribution to the album! 9/10 <br /> <br />3. I'm in Love with my Car - Roger taylor always had something to offer the band. this song's pretty intense. The guitar riff is just crazy. it's mind boggling that Roger Taylor could while playing drums but some people got skills like that. He's got such a raspy voice which contrasts so much with Freddie's or Brian's. It's a very nice voice nonetheless. This song rocks, and is now being used for Lexus commericials, if I am not mistaken. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />4. You're My Best Friend - Chances are pretty good that you've heard this Deacon track. Terrific bassline. ok, I admit it - the lyrics are a little corny - but the way Freddie sings them just gives it so much power and beauty. Deacon played keyboard on this one, in fact. Wote it for his best lady friend. Another one that will get you singing and ripe for quotation. 9/10 <br /> <br />5. '39 - When i first listened to this song I didn't know what to think. An acoustic based song with standup bass in the midst of such an overblown album as this seemed rather strange. Eventually it dawned on me that this song's simplicity was what made it beautiful. Brian may wrote this one and he does all the vocals too. The lyrics are absolutely terrific on this one. The closing line is absolutely haunting: \\"for my life, still ahead, pity me.\\" This song is really just beautiful. one of brian may's finest creations. 9.75/10 <br /> <br />6. Sweet Lady - ugh! Brian!! What were you thinking?? For all this album's greatness, it's not perfect. Brian may had to throw in this more or less crap filler right after one of his greatest songs. This is, as another reviewer noted, Queen trying to show they could rock. Don't get me wrong - <br />queen could rock. They did it a lot. This song, however, is just so weak. Even freddie's vocals don't impress me, much which is rare. This is the only song on the cd that is skippable. The ending guitar solo is pretty good and makes up a bit for the rest a bit. Still, one of Queen's worst songs. 4.5 / 10  <br /> <br />7. Seaside Rendevous - ah Freddie, way to bring the album back up! It is quite similiar to \\"lazing on a sunday afternoon\\" in its campiness, but different in every other aspect. The lyrics are hilarious and amazing. The piano line just works so well with this song. The vocal overdubs are just great, too. The real highlight, however, is the middle. Freddie plays a woodwind section with his voice, and Roger Taylor plays a brass section with his voice! Truly amazing to hear! There really was no end to the talent these guys possessed. 9.75/10 <br /> <br />8. Prophet's Song - Brian makes up for \\"Sweet Lady\\" with this one. Stars off with some wooshy noises followed by acoustic guitar and some kind of japanese string instrument. Freddie comes in with his vocals which are top notch. Oh, but then it rocks - and it rocks hard. This is queen rocking. the guitar riff remind me of somethign native american - esque. A war dance of sorts. The lyrics are absolutely amazing. Interpret them as you would, but i think they contain a highly religious theme. Freddie sings them with so much feeling. BUT the highlight is the hugggge accapella middle. Sure it's long. Sure it's excessive. But if you listen to it loud enough, sing along, and have an open mind you will absolutely fall in love with it. The song soon gets back to rocking and finishes the way it entered. a real winner. One of Brian May's best. 10/10 <br /> <br />9. Love of my life - The transition from \\"prophet's song\\" to this song is so impecabble. It just works so well. lovely piano + harp + simple bassline + freddie's truly angelic voice = pure success. One of queen's greatest songs ever. freddie puts so much feeling into every single word he sings. It's mind boggling how good his singing and piano line work. The vocal overdubbs work amazingly too. This is truly a queen masterpiece. 10/10 <br /> <br />10. Good Company - An interesting transition from the sad \\"Love of my Life\\". This song is just fun. Have an open mind! I love singing along to this song, and yes, it will be stuck in your head for days. Some dismiss it as filler but it's got too much in it to be filler. Jazz guitar orchestration (a whole lot of guitars at that) and ukelele - what more could you want!?! Clever lyrics as well - brian may was possibly the best lyricist from the band. A great addition to this album. Nice bassline too. 9/10 <br /> <br />11. Bohemian Rhapsody - Funny how no one actually says anything about this song. Everyone always says \\"everyone's heard this song\\" or \\"this is the most amazing thing ever.\\" Well, maybe not everyone has heard this song and not everyone understands why it is so amazing. It therefore bears neccesity to be said. tTe introduction is freddie overdubbeed four times producing some lovely vocal harmonies. Then the piano line comes in which quickly becomes one of the greatest in rock history. Eventually we get to \\"mama just killed a man\\" part. This first verse is absolutely stunningly beautiful. Freddie's voice, the lyrics, bass, and piano all come together to form one of the most amazing products immaginable. The whole first and second verses are stunning - truly stunning. This is followed by another one of rock's most esteemed guitar solos courtesy of Mr. Brian May. Instantly recognisable. Brian may had a terrific way of not just sticking a solo into a song. Rather he wrote a song to be the defining apex, to build upon the crescendo that had led up to it - and then to exceute. But the song is far from over. It then goes into probably the most ridiculous and crazy minute some odd in rock history. Over 128 vocal overdubs! Amazing harmonies! Finally this section boils over to the third section of the song, the rocking part. And it truly is queen rocking. They could do it and here it is proved. This part also has very strong lyrics. Finally Brian does a couple runs up his guitar and there's some more piano fanfare before it finally returns to a similar vibe from the first verse. The lyrics get quieter and quieter and eventually it's just some nice guitar tapping from brian and piano. At the very end it's just piano and Freddie singing \\"any way the wind blows\\" - and with a cymbol crash from Roger, it's all over. 12/10 <br /> <br />12. God Save the Queen - A challenge for every band is what song to put after the most epic song you've ever written. The only thing that could really live up to it would be another epic, and that cycle could go on forever. Therefore, Queen choose to end the album with a great guitar orchestration piece by Brian which really closes the album well. For tying together all loose ends, 9/10 <br /> <br /> <br />Well, that's quite a lot to say about this one album. But it truly is that amazing. If \\"Night at the Opera\\" is not in your cd collection by now you should be ashamed of yourself. It truly is an album which everyone will love, from fans of classical to hardcore punks. An incredible album and quite possibly queen's greatest work. Buy it. You will be wow-ed <br />
B00004YRQA|5.0|This memory card is great!!! Really it is.  <br />I mean without it...what could you do? Other then playing a game and not be able to save. :p <br />And this is an official one too!

0440237688|4.0|This book is based in this fictional society where everyone is provided for and everything is the same.  Differences are frowned upon and being the same as everyone else is encouraged.  The laws are strict and no one dares to disobey them.  Lowry depicted a certain kind of \\"utopia\\" in this novel.  A \\"utopia\\" that might not be that far off in the future.  This book portrayed what could possibly happen if we give the government too much authority.  This book was a real eye opener and really makes you think about the possibilities of tomorrow.  I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good read that keeps you at the edge of your seat wanting to find out what happens next.
0156027321|1.0|What a waste of a good snowy weekend to read.  I was a little skeptical of the book based on the prologue  but decided to stick with it anyway.  It was so boring, repetitive, and how many different ways can the author describe interactions with the tiger and fishing for food?? I have never been compelled to write a review before, but this book did it for me.  i would have had better time spent reading old National Enquirers!!
B00006RCNJ|5.0|Of the three DVD's that I have seen this one is the best.  The last of the DVD is awsome.  He plays Glenn Miller, \\"Andre Sisters\\" La Bamba (take off on Beetoven), Stars and Stripes forever etc.  More diversity with this one than the others.
B00009UW0N|5.0|Yes this is a classic masterpiece of genius, this mayb the best killer horror movie ever, this played the other day, its like my 100th time watching it, what do you expect it's Michael Myers this is were it all starts.
B00005JM02|5.0|I'm 14 years old and I love this movie. It was one of the best movies ever. All my friends loved this movie. Everyone should see this movie. If you're 5, 15, 35, 75 or 105 you should see this movie. It's about this little fish, Nemo who gets taken from the ocean to a dentist's office. Then his dad has to find him with the help of Dory and all the great characters he meets along the way. This movie is great!!
B00005J6UP|5.0|yea I love this movie, its a classic that will never die and never get old I been watching this movie since i was born, a classic.The Goonies is all time classic that everybody loves.
B0001US8EO|1.0|This had to be the longest, dullest movie I have ever watched.  Though to be honest I did fast forward through a great deal of it because it was so incredibly boring.  Way too much Kevin Costner!  Dennis Quaid was okay as Doc Holliday, though Val Kilmer was much more fun and interesting in Tombstone.  Lewis Smith as Curly Bill definately could have been developed more.  He's a gorgeous guy and should have been in more scenes and given a few lines to speak.  His character was  spoken about amongst the leading characters quite a bit leading the viewer to think he was 'important' though his character never developed in this rendition of the story.  In Tombstone, Curly Bill was definately a major character and I just wish Wyatt Earp had done the same instead of making the viewer wonder what all the talk was about.
0385474547|3.0|In my Opinion the book was ok. It wasn't one of the best books i've ever read nor one of the worst books I ever read. It does have some qualities, themes, and lessons that are important however. One theme is the struggle between tradition and change. This is shown the Okonkwo, the main character, and his village trying to hold onto their traditions in the face of rising conflicts and change with the white men, their government, and the church that is started near their village. Another is the view on masculinity which is shown by Okonkwo and his struggle to be different from his lazy neglectful father. He then tries to teach his son his ideas yet they don't take route. This ends up in beatings from Okonkwo to his children and wives because of his stress. Even though this book was not interesting (to me at least) it does contain many important lessons and themes as mentioned above.
B00000JCB2|5.0|I LOVE THIS ALBUM. WHEN IT WAS RELEASED I LIKED IT ALSO. 1999 WAS JUST A GREAT TIME IN MY LIFE. THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT SONGS. I GUESS OVER THE YEARS PEOPLE HAVE STARTED TO DISLIKE FRED DURST A LOT. WHEN THIS ALBUM CAME OUT IT WAS POPULAR.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|The hype surrounding this handsome singer is understandable - take a listen and a look! Discovering Buble was like discovering gold, truly a gem to treasure!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is a must have cd.
B0000C1733|1.0|NO AEROPLANE, I REPEAT NO AEROPLANE. NO WARPED, I REPEAT NO WARPED. AMONG OTHER SONGS OMMITTED VERY DISAPPOINTING AND THE DISC IS ONLY 60 SOMETHING MINUTES WHICH MEANS THEY COULD HAVE PUT MORE SONGS ON THE DISC.
B0006399FS|4.0|I must disagree with the person who said October is their worst album, I happen to be one who marks October as being my favorite in many polls.<br /><br />Having that settled, if you're looking for a best album from U2, I am sorry to say, this is not it.  \\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\\" to me is a work in progress.  As good as it is, I am not saying its bad; but I must admit, I expected to hear another song in the album that would match the greatness of Vertigo.  While there are many good songs, and they are very good, but no one matches Vertigo not even by a breeze.<br /><br />And while others might disagree, if you're looking for some late U2 that will leave you gasping for more, get \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" instead.<br /><br />And to those who are wondering, I've been a fan for a good 14 years.  And I regretted not getting October earlier, I got it in the week of 9/11.  The ONLY ONE album I needed to complete my collection of U2 then, and I regret highly not to have gotten it earlier basically because I followed the reviews that were like the one that this nice person who said October was their worst album.  That's the only thing I disagree with in his review.<br /><br />And I totally disagree with the guy who said this is U2 worst album.  My suggestion is, dont read the reviews, listen to the samples instead and you be the judge; dont let reviews keep you from getting a great album.  This one happens to be a great album just as well as October.  Just not their best.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|for anyone whos looking to purchase the album, if you havent heard or aren't too familiar with godsmack's previous works then you may find this album very enjoyable. but for those who are well acquainted with the previous two works, this album just falls short so to speak. i cant sit there and say this is a bad album, because quite frankly its not. but honestly, not only is the album too reminiscent to the others, it also seems that every song is jus so similar to the song prior or following. it gets annoying and it makes you not want to hear the album more then once. half of the time i cant tell the difference between faceless, changes, make me believe, re-align, or releasing the demons. not to say theyre bad songs. i f****** hate you just happens to be the song that always gets skipped and its easy to see why. the good news is, there are some stand out tracks that give the album the 4 stars i feel it deserves. straight outta line, i stand alone, i am, and serenity are straight up beautiful songs. i cant even begin to emphasize how fantastic serenity is. it grabs you and holds you in one spot. i'd give the album 5 stars if serenity was the only song on there. if this album was their first attempt on the scene, it would probably be such a critically acclaimed album because they still showcase their talent to the best of their potential. the shredding solo's in almost every song are crazy and sully erna is such a distinguished frontman with such a passion for his music. but for a third album faceless is repetitive, boring, and simply falls short...shamefully. needless to say ill continue to love godsmack because overall they are a sick band.
1401300901|5.0|I really liked chick lit when it first came out...then everyone jumped on the ban wagon and before I knew it book stores were full of books with the same plot and differently named characters.  So I moved on to try and find a new genre that was light and fun to read.  This book fits the bill.  It is a nice girlie read considering the female bonding throughout the book but it is much more than that.  I cried, I laughed and my heart ached while reading.  The characters were easy to identify with and although the situation was foreign to me I was able to relate to feelings of the characters and even relate it to my own life.  The best part of the book was that the ending was not predictable although it did leave me with a happy, hopeful heart.  I'd definitely recommend this book and plan on reading her newest.
B0000DDPEQ|4.0|\\"Let It Be\\" was always my least favorite Beatles album, although it was years before I understood that Phil Spector had gone all \\"Wall of Sound\\" on the tracks after the Beatles and producer George Martin washed their hands of the entire thing and left it with engineer Glyn Johns. For most of that period my opinion was based on comparing \\"Let It Be\\" with \\"Abbey Road,\\" in which case there was no question as to which album was better. Beyond that I never really liked \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" or \\"Let It Be,\\" dismissing them as Paul McCartney's attempt to write another \\"Hey Jude,\\" and only moderately liking \\"I Me Mine\\" and \\"Across the Universe,\\" which I was moderately horrified to discover were two of the tracks Spector worked over, \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" being the third.<br /><br />Of course, now we know as much about the history of this album as anything in the Beatles catalogue, which means even with \\"Let It Be...Naked\\" available knowledgeable Beatles fans can complain that this is not the \\"Get Back\\" album that Johns originally pieced together before Spectator came in and overdubbed three tracks. Gone from the old version are \\"Dig It\\" and \\"Maggie Mae,\\" with \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" added. Then the order gets reshuffled, so that \\"Get Back\\" starts the album and \\"Let It Be\\" ends it. In fact, if you have the original track listings memorized numerically the only one with the same number is #2, \\"Dig a Pony.\\" There is also a bonus disc, \\"Fly on the Wall,\\" which lets us hear the Beatles at work in rehersal and in the studio during January 1969, which is worth a listen to one or twice.<br /><br />The net result is that \\"Let It Be...Naked\\" is better than \\"Let It Be,\\" but the result is still not a great Beatles album. Maybe what they needed to do was more like what happened to \\"With the Beatles\\" when it was turned into their first American release, \\"Meet the Beatles.\\" Throw in \\"The Ballad of John and Yoko,\\" \\"Old Brown Shoe,\\" and maybe even \\"You Know My Name (Look Up the Number)\\" and then we would be getting closer to the next level. Besides, I miss John Lennon's \\"hope we passed the audition\\" at the end of \\"Get Back.\\" There is such a thing as cleaning up an album too much. All of this just makes it even more impressive that after the \\"Let It Be\\" debacle that the Beatles went back in the studio and went out on top with \\"Abbey Road.\\"e Number)\\" and then we would be getting closer to the next level.

B00008AWOD|5.0|Let me give you some of the history of this band. Placebo started off as a post-grunge act with a touch of glam, on the other end of the spectrum which has the Pixies, Sonic Youth and Dinosaur Jr. in the fore (as proto-grunge), and Nirvana and the Smashing Pumpkins in the middle.    They first crashed into the UK charts in 1997 with their number 4 smash hit 'Nancy Boy', a phenomenal tune. They are a great singles band - their 3 studio albums up until this one are all very good, featuring some great album cuts too, but lacked consistency. I'm not going to be overly critical; it's simply that I'm a perfectionist and also feel that every Beatles album I've heard (quite a few), to take a prime example (as we are talking about great music here), lack consistency - this doesn't stop the Beatles being my favourite band.    This album ranks up there with just 3 others in my (large and ever larger) collection - Nirvana's Nevermind, the Pixies' Surfer Rosa and the Smiths' The Queen is Dead - as simply flawless. It starts off with the blistering instrumental Bulletproof Cupid: it's just what you want as an opener; melodic, but high-charged. It moves through a range of styles, I'll give you an idea of two of the less well-known tracks: Something Rotten is Brian Eno-like ambiental, while Second Sight is simply catchy guitar pop with great hooks. I won't bother doing a review of each song as you can listen to samples of them right here on Amazon and get your own idea.    Placebo have already hit the singles top 20 in America (Pure Morning in 1998), and I'm still hopeful future albums will bring them more success. I'd just like to let the American public know that they're already huge throughout Europe, as I do feel that some of the time commercial success is an indicator of greatness.    In summary, I highly recommend this album.
0790729342|5.0|There was a period when I would tell people that the last decent Western I saw was \\"The Road Warrior\\" (nee \\"Mad Max II\\").  I am sure there were other decent Westerns in between \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" and \\"Dances With Wolves,\\" but that would take research and the whole point of the comment was that \\"The Road Warrior\\" has the sensibilities of a classic Western.  There have been attempts to turn Westerns into Science Fiction, but just because you put \\"High Noon\\" in outer space as they did in \\"Outland\\" does not mean that it has the soul of a Western.  Films such as that are reduced to gimmicks, and you do not have the sort of resonance you get by, say, updating Shakespeare (e.g., Orson Welles and John Houseman doing \\"Julius Caesar\\" in the 1930s in a fascist setting).<br /><br />What I find most fascinating is that director George Miller is able to extend what he created in 1979's \\"Mad Max\\" into the post-apocalyptical world of this 1981 sequel (continued in 1985's \\"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\\" but not to be followed by the planned 2005 film \\"Mad Max: Fury Road\\").  The film opens with an explanation of what happened, which also works in scenes from the original \\"Mad Max.\\"  Basically, we had Mel Gibson back as \\"Mad\\" Max Rockatansky, but now civilization has collapsed.  We assume Max is no longer a cop because there are no longer any cops (or he is in the wasteland of Australia where cops no longer dare venture).  In the first film Max is motivated by revenge as he pays back the bikers who destroyed his family, but this time his only concern is survival, which means finding petrol to keep his car going (not that he has any where to go).  But the key thing here is that in this New West just think \\"gas\\" instead of \\"gold.\\"<br /><br />Max and his dog are wandering the wasteland in his black V8 interceptor and after an initial encounter with one of the gangs that roam the area, he stumbles upon the Gyro Captain (Bruce Spence), so named because he has a small gyrocopter.  When he finds out Max is after fuel the Gyro Captain leads him to an oil refinery being besieged by what has to be the most powerful outlaw gang in the area, led by The Humungus (Kjell Nilsson), whose hockey mask predates Jason Voorhees by several years and who is announced by his Toadie as \\"The Ayatollah Of Rock-And-Rolla\\"!  Inside the fortified refinery is a group that is trying to preserve civilization, but Max could care less.  They have a tanker that they are filling with petrol and that is all that matters to our hero, who is busy playing up the big anti-hero chip on his shoulder at this point.<br /><br />The plot has to do with how Max eventually comes to play the requisite role of the hero, but what makes this film memorable are the action sequences.  The temptation is to describe the main ones as \\"car chases,\\" but when you see these you are not thinking Steve McQueen in \\"Bullit.\\"  Instead your are thinking of John Wayne in the original \\"Stagecoach.\\"  In other words, what would Indians chasing cowboys be like if they all were driving souped up desert buggies.  Yet even with all the hot rods and tankers this one is going to come down to Max against Wes (Vernon Wells), The Hummungus' right-hand attack dog, who wears a big Mohawk, keeps a young blonde guy on a chain behind him on his chopper, and is as strong and as athletic as he is psychotic.  Actually, Wes upstages The Hummungus as the film's villain.  Then there is Emil Minty as The Feral Kid, who must have a fascinating back-story somewhere in the recesses of Miller's mind, and Virginia Hey, the future Pa'u Zotoh Zhaan on \\"Farscape,\\" as the Warrior Woman.<br /><br />The leader of the people dressed in white, Pappagallo (Mike Preston), wants to use the petrol to start a new life up north (I would head for the Great Barrier Reef for the fish, but what do I know about survival?).  Implicit in that goal is the notion of what sort of new world can be created from the ruins of the old one, and while that is thepot at the end of the rainbow for \\"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\\" as well, it is not a real concern.  This film comes down to the action sequences, and there is a sense in which the entire plot is simply an excuse to put these characters in crazy looking vehicles and tear on down the ribbon of highway at high speeds.  However, a lot of people who have enjoyed \\"The Road Warrior\\" have not minded.  Wes is an unforgettable villain, there are other quirky characters, and the crashes are pretty spectacular, especially since this is the old days and none of this is CGI.

When it comes to films where they put the pedal to the metal, this one is hard to beat.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I'm not sure if it is repeated viewing or the realization that the last film will be here soon, but this one has grown on me. Return of the Jedi was always the problem child for me. It was replaced when this one came out. Once again the effects are breathtaking, but it has several obvious weak points. We should have met Skywalker at a later age. Jar jar is completely useless. My favorite peev though is the point where Skywalker destroys the control ship and say's \\"Now this is pod racing!\\". I can never help myself but to respond with \\"No, this is warfare and many people have just died!\\"<br /><br />However, within the storyline George has laid out, this film does what it sets out to do. And there are moments of brilliance. The podrace and the duel are worth price of admission alone. If we did not know what was going to happen in future segments of the story it would all be very mysterious (I plan to make my grandchildren watch them in correct order!)<br /><br />Overall, I would say that the rabid negative reactions many had towards this installment were tad over done. After all, even the worst Star Wars movie is still much better than the majority of stuff we get. George has created a whole galaxy for us to explore, unlike LOTR where existing mythology was just pasted together in a new format. I enjoyed Episode 2 and have high expectations for Episode 3. I even hope somebody picks up the flag and does other Star Wars stories.
B0000046KM|5.0|The title song HERE'S TO LIFE is simply among the all time great song recordings ever, period! The other songs, all lush with a full orchestra, arranged by Mandel, may not be quite in this league, but are all 5-star greats! So if you want to hear one of the finest CD's ever recorded, step right up, and order this right now!
B00005JLWN|4.0|I liked this movie.  There were some minor plot holes and it did slow down once or twice, but 99% of movies are no different. <br /> <br />What I enjoyed most was that even though it used elements from several well-known movies or books, the makers were brave enough to do some things drastically different, even if it didn't always work. <br /> <br />I think it is laughable to compare this movie to the Matrix. I think that years from now Equilibrium will still be discussed and debated with all of its flaws, while the Matrix will probably look and feel dated.  If you think about it, this is a very old and often copied story: <br /> <br />The young man (the One) who performs miracles and who will save us all. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> <br />Now I do love the Matrix for what it is. The timing of its release was perfect and it had the feel of something new from Hollywood. I don't see, however, why a person can't like both movies.  Is this a competition or something?  People actually seem angry that they are reminded of the Martix when they watch Equilibrium!  After my second time seeing the Matrix, I was reminded of Dark City, but I didn't get upset by it. <br /> <br />Another note:  Another reviewer wrote that if there had been no Matrix, there would have been no Equilbrium - I submit if there had been no Dracula, Dark City, Blade, The Last Dragon or any other movie that featured skilled fighters, an important mythology or tragedy, gothic trappings, long coats/cloaks and one person who is the best of us or the \\"One\\", there would have been no Matrix.   <br /> <br />To end, I think that The Matrix had great effects and a tighter story and I enjoyed the martial arts, the acting of Christian Bale, and surprisingly, the deeper sense of emotion and drama in Equilibrium. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001XAPY2|5.0|As a fan of this film for some years, I read the reviews posted here before obtaining a copy of the Disney release, because I wanted to be prepared for any disappointments if there were really egregious departures from the impressions I've formed of Miyazake's vision for his work.    No worries; after watching the DVD...twice now, with occasional pauses to switch language/subtitle tracks...I don't think there's a thing wrong with Disney's release.    As to the film itself, I love it; as I say above, it's been a favorite of mine for years. This somewhat quirky action/adventure story is a blast for any fan of the genre, but it's the aviation angle that grabs me in this one. Technically, for those who haven't seen it, Hayao Miyazake's affinity for aviation is most evident in this film...as a pilot and long time aviation junkie, it feels near-perfect to me, and explains why it's a personal high scorer on my own top ten list.  The pertinent discussion here, though, is Disney's addition of an English language track in this release, so in writing this review I shall focus on my own feelings about it.    Now, I'm certainly no expert in the field of cinematic art, but I've watched a bunch of different versions of this film, from mediocre fan-subs on VHS to more professional DVD editions, so I have got several comparisons in mind to help form my opinion.    To begin with, sure, there are some minor variations from the dialogue I've seen before, but to me there's nothing significant to quibble over. I suppose if I was conversant in idiomatic Japanese I could speak with more authority, but I didn't have any jarring moments while watching the film, with two minor exceptions: Marco's original surname, 'Pabatto,' being substituted  with the name 'Rosselini,' in the English dub and the mutation of his friend's name (and one of Gina's husbands) from 'Belneldi' to 'Berlini.' I suspect the latter may have been a bit of misunderstanding in the original Japanese actor Shuichiro Moriyama's pronunciation of the 'Ls' in the name that got carried over to this new release, though the name 'Belneldi' is clearly written on the group photo of Marco and his friends that still hangs in Gina's office.    The change from Marco Pabatto's name is less forgivible; even in this release if the original Japanese audio track (and the French one, too...I think; kinda hard to make out, but it sure isn't 'Rosselini!) is selected you can clearly hear Fio asking about 'Marco Pabatto' in the conversation at the campsite where Porco discloses his supernatural experience during the war, after which he was transformed into a pig.    Still, that's but a ripple on an otherwise serene sea, at least for me. I thought Michael Keaton did a fine job as Porco, from what I've read here I was expecting more of an over-the-top vocalization like he did in 'Beetlejuice.' Nope, nice work.    On the other hand, while Keaton is good, happily the very best Porco voice I've yet heard is right on this DVD, in Jean Reno's interpretation on the French audio track. I read on nausicaa.net that Miyzake-san thought Reno was even better than Moriyama's original Porco, and I concur in spades. I almost wish he'd done the English dub, too; it wouldn't be the first time this Frenchman played an Italian in an English-language movie...remember 'Leon,' aka 'The Professional?' Great actor.    One reviewer here disliked Susan Egan's take on the song 'Le temps des cerises' that Gina sings early in the picture, but I believe full credit should be given to Ms. Egan for making the effort to sing as well as a professional lounge chanteuse in addition to performing her speaking part in the film for consistency's sake. I admit to being terribly biased in this case, as I think Susan Egan has one of the most appealing and sultry speaking voices I've ever heard, but as for myself, I thoroughly enjoyed her rendition of the song, even if it might not have been quite as technically skilled as the original version was.As for the English speaking Gina being 'curiously distant,' as Mr. Solomon commented in his in-house review, I must respectfully disagree with his asessment. Of course Gina is somewhat distant, she's had three husbands killed already, with her true love and old flame Porco still alive but in constant peril...even she herself comments at one point that she's cried herself out over the years and now only feels numb! Yet, in the film's more emotional moments I found Ms. Egan's Gina just as warm and intimate as Ms. Kato's ever was, sometimes even more so. Okay, it's subjective, and I'm biased. Your mileage may vary!    Cary Elwes was a hoot as Donald Curtis, with his mildly goofy Texas accent, and Kimberly Williams gave a great performance as Fio, sounding just as cute and spunky as did the original Japanese actress, Akemi Okamura. No disappointments there.    Top marks for David Ogden Stiers' take on Grandpa Piccolo in this release. He gets better every time with these projects; his inflection, tone, and nuance of voice are terrific, and his old codger's cackle is perfection itself. As impressed as I was with his characterization of Kamaji in 'Spirited Away,' he blew me away with his wonderfully hilarious voice acting here!    To sum up, for me Disney has taken one of my favorite films of all time and made it even more enjoyable with their version. I've recommended this film for years to friends and family, but had few takers as many of them didn't have the patience to pay the closer attention than normal required when viewing a subtitled movie. Now this has been remedied and the only thing seriously lacking in my Miyazaki collection is their English dub of Tonari no Totoro...c'mon, Disney, you can do it!
B00005YXZH|5.0|Listening to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is akin to getting drunk on a bottle a bottle of cheap red wine, waking up just before or on dawn, barely able to raise your head and wondering just how the heck you ended up here in this place, with your life.  There is a kind of freedom to be found in the early stages of a hangover - your senses, physical and mental are still numb.  You're coming down off a high.  But then reality sets in and depending on which circumstances you got drunk, in celebration or in an effort to escape (or both) very much determines how well you'll recover from it. <br /> <br />Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is both elating and depressing.  Either way, you won't come out unscathed. <br /> <br />The circumstances under which the band made this album are well documented - they were more or less told this was a career-ending move by Reprise.  Jeff and Jay, perhaps the greatest songwriters of alternative-rock/country in the mid-late 1990's were drifting apart from each other, both as friends and musicians.  The documentary \\"I am trying to break your heart\\" shows the emotional and physical depths to which their relationship had sunk. <br /> <br />Little wonder then, that the album, which sat on the shelf for close to a year before release due to record label cold feet, is so full of turmoil.  Each song is an episode of modern day isolation, both from the world at large and from the narrator's friends, family, lovers, and to an extent even himself.  From the woozy, rambling drunken blur that is the opening track, to the hollow promises of \\"Jesus Etc.\\", to the crumbling fantasy world of \\"Poor Place's\\".  Musically, the album is a brooding mix of alt.country and blues, laced with shots of radio static, slide guitar, scatter-shot drum fills, distorted electric guitar freakouts, strings and psychedelic-era Pink Floyd keyboards.  But do not think this is some Spector-style bombast.  Far from it.  The sound often as harrowing as the lyrics, with each the effects being used sparsely, often only with a single acoustic holding the structure of the song in one piece.  The production is one that is both somewhat harsh, and yet warm, acoustic guitars dominating, with a delicate balance of sound effects and electric leads.  Most songs seem to vary wildly between the two - \\"Ashes Of American Flags\\" being a prime example. <br /> <br />This album is a credit to its creator's vision, and in all honesty, head and shoulders above anything else Wilco has done.  And given the high quality of Wilco's past and current output, that is saying something.  It's a slice of pre-dawn hangover that you don't have to get drunk on anything but the music. <br /> <br />\\"You were so right when you said that I've been drinking\\" <br />

B00005R62N|5.0|\\"Unleashed in the East\\" was one of the first Priest-records i purchased(back then on vinyl). But this new version of one of rock's greatest live-documents is a hit and a must-have, because of the bonus tracks which are essential elements of a Priest-live set. These tracks really worthen up the whole thing and are a must-buy even for fans who already have an older version of this furious live performance.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney's third album proved that she really cares for music. She did an amazing job on this album working with The Neptunes(I'm a Slave 4 U; Boys) Max Martin once again(Overprotected;Not a Girl),Rodeny Jerkins(Lonely;Anticipating)and Wade Robson(What it's like to be me). This is an enjoyable album and for the first time you can really dance to this tracks. Here there's no horrible filler ballads(for the exception of 'Not a girl')like she had in her previous albums. The only bad thing of this CD is 'I love Rock 'n' Roll'...Didn't Britney learn something from doing the bad cover of 'Satisfaction' on her sophemore album? <br />Well this album is a must-have for all Britney's fans and for casual fans too. This album worth your money completely!
B00005K9LN|5.0|\\"British Steel\\" was a major hit for the band and will forever be one of the most important works in the long discography of the metal titans. The disc contains classic heavy hitters like \\"Grinder\\",\\"Living After Midnight\\" or \\"Breaking The Law\\". Those songs alone are reason for puchasing the record, which is considered by many as the finest work of the Birmingham Priests.
0395925037|5.0|As the review title states most people will put this book face down and refuse to read it because of the author.  As other reviewers have stated, this book probably shaped the political, social and economic environment of the latter 20th century like no other.  As you read and analyze, based on the knowledge of the outcome, one can only scratch the surface of how insane this person and his ideas were but still very much alive in the world today.   <br />In the United States the instant association of Hitler is linked to the white supremist movements, but the same philosophy is also present in the feminist movements, pro-abortion lobby, the compartmentilization of cultures in the differing diversity programs etc. Unfortunately most are afraid to read this book but if they do these associations and the parallelism are readily apparent.  <br />This book should be required reading in any history program but it never will be.
0780626966|4.0|This box set containing all of the films(as of this writing) of the Nightmare on Elm Street series is a pure bundle of horrific fun.<br /><br />Not all of the films are created equal of course(not many in any series are)and they may have lost some of their original clout but they are still a delight to watch and follow along to.<br /><br />Robert Englund as Freddy literally \\"owns\\" the part.Most of his lines in the films may have been written for him(there are exceptions) but he made Freddies' walk and mannerisms all his.And thankfully this is one of the reasons New Line never has(and hopefully never will)replace him with anyone else.<br /><br />Another thing I loved about Freddy as the series progressed was his tongue in cheek humour.This just enhanced the whole character of Freddy to a greater degree.<br /><br />As the extras that are contained in this set reveal you will find out that Robert Shaye the head of New Line pictures and even the creator Wes Craven have been,and unusually so,very concerned and aware of fans concerns regarding the series every step of the way.Both have gone to great pains to keep a consistancy throughout the entire series and stay true to its' central theme and characters.<br /><br />The bonus disc contains a plethora of extras that will satisfy just about everyone.It also contains a \\"labyrinth\\" that one must go through in an exact and certain way in order to enjoy all of its' 'hidden' features.Not easy to get through for sure but an enjoyable way to pass some time and learn alot about these films that you didn't know before.<br /><br />In conclusion I highly recommend this set to all fans of the series.The transfers are for the most part very well done and I'm sure it will not fail to disappoint most viewers.

B00013F35I|5.0|This is my first experience of seeing Bruce and co. and I found it exhilerating.  <br />He gives 300% and is totally present and expressive of what he is singing about.  <br />He begins on a really strong note with 'The Rising' and it doesnt let up from there on. I kept revisiting the haunting 'Empty Sky' done in duet, and 'Missing you' and found 'Ramrod' a fascinating piece with Bruce really abandoning himself to a wide range of struts and facial expressions. <br />These songs are expanded from his original takes of them on CD and are a major advance over them. <br />I found the whole thing completely satisfying and enjoyable and can definitely recommend this album to those who dont know Bruce or who only know him from CD. I'm sure all established fans too would be more than satisfied.
B0006SSOHC|1.0|This movie is seriously a joke! The editing is horrificly bad, the set design is way over the top. . . I mean come on, how could ever square inch of every \\"scary\\" room have \\"perfect\\" lighting?! It's ridiculous. Cary Elwes gives his absolute worst performance ever. . . . and compared to the films he's done, I guess this would be his best. He, as well as every character in this huge blunder, is completely unbelievable, and the production is as good as a middle school talent show. I cannot believe Hollywood puts as much funding as they do into material this atrociously bad. Shame on you if you waste any of your life on trying to dive into the mess-up called \\"Saw\\"
B000000H3W|5.0|While the above Amazon review calls Sepultura's \\"Arise\\" their breakthrough, it's without a doubt that the band's real breakthrough was the previous classic \\"Beneath the Remains\\".  That aside, \\"Arise\\" is another masterpiece from the Brazilian death metal machine, and this album found the band honing their sound.  The title track, \\"Dead Embryonic Cells\\", and \\"Altered State\\" are classic Sepultura dirges, while their blistering cover of Motorhead's \\"Orgasmatron\\" must be heard to be believed.  Max Cavalera's rhythm guitar picking rivals, and in some instances even excells over, James Hetfield; while brother Igor's drumming assault alone will make bang your head.  All in all, \\"Arise\\" is another classic album from Sepultura, even though it's not as influential as \\"Beneath the Remains\\", it still remains an all time classic, and is sure better than anything Max has come up with over the past few years.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|I thought this was an incredible movie--moving, comical, tragic,romantic maybe, all rolled into one. Definitely a film for adults and children alike. I saw it the day the Oscar nominations came out (although I had intended to see it before)and I was blown away! Johnny Depp was incredible, Kate Winslet wonderful and the children were amazing. This is my idea of a Best PIcture in the fashion of Old Hollywood--a film with an ongoing and timeless message. It is a movie that makes one stop and look at what is really important in a world of cell phones, 50 inch TV's and all the crass materialism of today's world. I am a huge fan of the Victorian era so this film was right up my alley but the message of the film spoke to my soul in such a way that mere words cannot describe it. I boo-hooed my heart out (along with the other 12 people in the theater that day). This is an ageless film that EVERYONE should see and pay attention to the core theme of following and listening to your heart and keeping the child in you alive.
1400032717|4.0|I am not a mystery fan.  With that sallient point out of the way, I will say that I found this book to be enlightening and heartwarming but not riveting.  Luckily for me, the mystery is unraveled while allowing the characters to unfold.  So, I looked at this book as a character study, and found that the people in the book are very interesting and, on occasion, achieve \\"almost fascinating\\" status.      I believe that the main character's disability is accurately portrayed.  Because he is presented in such an intimate, first person way, I got a new, fresh, \\"in my face\\" perspective on what it must be like to live with autism.  I found it to be exhausting.  My analogy is that it felt like being required to count and examine and understand an endless supply of tooth picks without ever being able to realize that it doesn't matter if you have a hundred, a thousand or a million tooth picks.  You just have a lot of tooth picks.  Additionally, these tooth picks have rules and characteristics that must be examined in great detail within each new situation that arises. Most profoundly, this adherence to known \\"tooth pick logic\\" is as important to the boy as anything else - including his relationships with his parents.  The ability to use judgement to prioritize information in order to reduce the number of details that must be faced each day is absent.  The process is maddening.       The parents are also very interesting to me.  They obviously had made many adjustments because of their love for their son.  It was easy to see that marital problems could arise because of the stress that he brings into their lives.  The twist about the mother's \\"death\\" seemed too contrived, but I guess it was required to satisfy the mystery.        I liked the book because it gave me a new way to see autism.  I enjoyed seeing parents loving their disabled child even though he seemed to revel in his own \\"unlovableness.\\" Read this for the character development and for the opportunity to see into themind of a very bright autistic young man.  See how he learns to make his way in the world.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|And I say that with complete flippin' sincerity. Anyone who disagrees should just get out of my life and shut up!<br /><br />Anyone who loves off-the-wall comedy will enjoy this movie. I had never heard of this movie until a buzz emerged, that it was a movie you could quote all day. As a lover of comedy dialogue, from Caddyshack to There's Something About Mary, I could not pass up the opportunity to annoy my coworkers with some fresh one-liners.<br /><br />This movie is not Adam Sandler/Saturday Night Live funny, it's not Farrelly brothers 'gross-out' funny, and it's definitely not Woody Allen 'thoughtful' funny. It's Kids in the Hall 'weird' funny, but the humor is also very light, very innocent. There is not a single phrase of profanity spoken the entire film. Once you understand the movie's vibe - if you're not laughing after the first scene on the school bus, then forget it - you'll never want it to end. I had the movie for a week and probably watched it 10 times (and I work full time and go to school at night). Some, in fact most, of the lines are so dumb they're funny.<br /><br />Napoleon is the ultimate nerd. He's such a Poindexter, that even the 'cools' don't know what to do with him. And his gang are all characters who have been alienated, usually by choice, with the exception of Uncle Rico, who blames his failure on something his high school football coach did back in '82. If you were ever picked on in school, ever been ridiculed or teased for ANYTHING, had ever felt lonely or unpopular, then you will identify with Napoleon. If you were a bully and pushed people around, then you'll definitely remember Napoleon!<br /><br />Yes, this movie basically has no plot. There is no army to defeat, no bomb to diffuse, no girl to seduce. It's a slice-of-life movie where it doesn't matter what happens - we've only been given a window into this bizarre world. And a window is all we'll need.<br /><br />I was surprised when some of my \\"hippest\\" friends thought this movie was terrible. Shocked when one told me she turned it off halfway through, and saddened when others told me they just didn't get it. One the other hand, nothing makes me happier than hearing Napoleon being quoted at work, school or out in public. It's like you can exchange Napoleon lines with complete strangers and laugh with the knowledge that you're `in the know.'<br /><br />People don't like this movie, sure. But they seem to be the cynics who overanalyze, and expect every movie to change their life. Napoleon Dynamite isn't about sweeping the Academy Awards, or appearing in the Top 10 of all-time movies.

B00005JLCI|5.0|The \\"To-be-or-not-to-be\\" soliloquy in this production is easily the best I've ever seen, and it's emblematic of the quality of the whole film. The scope of the film is, well, Shakespearean. Even its few flaws are writ large in 70mm. <br /> <br />So, how about a DVD? Is there some law that says, \\"This film is a milestone, so let's let it languish on VHS\\"?  <br /> <br />Are you listening, Hollywood?
B0000CDLA7|4.0|This review comes from someone whose point of view is not that of a Dream Theater fan.  My friend gave me this cd for my birthday, and it was the first time I had ever listened to them.  Of course I had heard of them but I had never even heard them, I knew they were good and had very talented musicians though.  So I was eager to listen to the album and experience Dream Theater for the first time.  The music was even better than I had anticipated.  I listen to a lot of great bands, but few of them can play as tight and well orchestrated than these guys.  I'm not really a fan of the whole Progressive/Arena metal scene apidimized by Queensryche so I'm not a huge fan of the vocals.  I can put up with it but I'm more of a fan of people like Layne Staley, Chris Cornell, Eddie Vedder, Zach De La Rocha, and more alternative vocalists.  I read a lot of reviews about how this album is different from their other albums and that it isnt as good.  I have no idea what any of the other stuff sounds like though. So coming from someone who is just an over all huge fan of most genres of rock music and not a fan of Dream Theater,  I really like the sound of this album especially the drums and heavy guitar/bass.  I just may become a Dream Theater fan now.
0385510454|5.0|I've been hooked on Grisham since reading The Client and The Firm in one weekend. I was a bit disappointed in The Summons, but had my love of Grisham's writing rejuvenated by The Painted House. Anyway, about The Broker. As a previous reviewer noted, The Broker falls back on Grisham's tried and true formula of a \\"sympathetic character, intrigue, and a chase leading into a good ending.\\" <br /> <br />My only disappointment with the book is the detail of life in Bologna. I suppose one could say the same thing for his details of Memphis in earlier works, but for some reason, my interest in the culture, language, and restaurants of Bologna did not work for me. Grisham's attempt to portray a book with international intrigue reminded me of a Ludlum novel-which I enjoy immensely, by the way. The Bourne Identity comes to mind.  <br /> <br />Grisham fans can buy this book with confidence. It's a good tale, with plenty of life threatening circumstances and a hero's use of his brains to escape the danger. <br />
0553582445|4.0|Firstly: All of Hobb's work, especially this trilogy, are outstanding pieces of work and I would highly recommend it to any fan of contempoty fiction. <br /> <br />The use of pace, tension and excellent prose makes this trilogy the type of book you stay up-till late at night to read. Hobb explores the philosophical dilemma of slavery and the 'for the greater good' in the trilogy.  <br /> <br />The reader is left wondering at the end of the novel if Fitz (the main character) is merely a dog to be commanded and abused or a hero who honourably sacrifices himself for his country. Hobb also explores and redefines here invented magic's: The Witt and The Skill. In Hobb's previous work these two struck me as ill throughout and illogical, however by clever use of having an introductory piece of writing from Skill and Witt experts at the beginning of each chapter these flaws are smoothed out. <br /> <br />The main reason why this book is not worth 5 stars (the readers who have given this book 5 stars are probably avid Hobb fans and would give any of her work 5 stars)is her inaccurate portrayal of the male psyche, her use of outrageous stereotypes and a flawed political/economics system. <br /> <br />For example: EVERYONE from Buck has black eyes, is stubborn and honourable. EVERYONE from Tith and Farrow are greedy rude and ignorant people. ALL teenage boys have beards by the age of 16, ALL teenage boys automatically go red when embarrassed and ALL teenage boys have polite an quaint sexual fantasies. 14 year old boys can strangle fully grown men. <br /> <br />Since I am a teenage boy I am quite offended at her presumption and this erroneously portrayal. Hobb is a 40+ overweight woman and she has no idea about male teenagers even if she owns one. <br />
B0006OBPTA|5.0|I just finished watching these films over the last week for the first time in years. This set is a must buy for anybody who has kids dealing with bullies. These are films that anybody alive can relate too with the trust in yourself message and fighting only as a last resort. Its also a wonderful take on Karate as an art and a spiritual excercise and not a form of violent fun that allows you to kill a man by ripping his heart out.<br /> The first film is hands down the best. Very sweet and full of wonderful human emotions. The seconed film is a decent sequal with pretty well the same qualities as the first but in a different local and the characters are a little older. The third is kinda silly with the revenge angle but I have seen worse. The last a latest remake stars the 2 time Oscar winner Hillary Swank in her break out role. Very much like the first but not quite as charming like the first three but hey a decent try none the less. The fourth film does have the best scene in the whole series. The scene is when the monks go bowling which is cheezy but funny.<br />The only gripe I have with the collection is the lack of extras. The first film had great extras but the seconed film had a making the sequal featurette but its 5 mins long and from 1986. It felt they didn't put to much thought in beefing up the last 3. They could have attempted to get Hillary Swank for a sit down retrospect on the next Karate Kid but nope. Other then that this set is a must buy that won't dissappoint fans young and old.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|All I can say is -WOW! Radio Head meets Queen is the best description I can give, yet, that underrates this CD, terribly. These guys are young and they are talented, two things that don't go together much these days. This is a well crafted album from beginning to end. There's a lot of passion and pain in this story of redeeming value. So many times during this disc, I thought I was listening to Freddie Mercury of Queen. There are no bad songs but some of it does sound like it was recorded in someones garage. This does not take away from - but rather enhances the story concept. I believe Muse - Absolution will be considered a classic, and it's legacy will grow with time, much like Led Zeppelin IV or Pink Floyd - Dark Side Of The Moon.
B00009V7P8|5.0|one of my only five star reviews. blew me away first time i heard it and still does. timeless.
B0000AUHQT|4.0|BOOKS AND FILMS ARE NOT USUALLY EXACTLY THE SAME.  IT WOULD BE HARD TO TAKE A TEST ON A BOOK IF YOU HAD ONLY WATCHED THE MOVIE.  THE MOVIE THE GREAT GATSBY IS LIKE THE BOOK IN MANY WAYS.  IT IS ALSO NOT LIKE IT IN MANY WAYS. <br />    THE GREAT GATSBY TOOK PLACE IN THE 1920'S.  THE CHARACTERS ARE ALL EITHER NEW RICH OR OLD RICH CITIZENS OF NEW YORK.  THE MAIN CHARACTERS WERE DAISY AND GATSBY.  GATSBY IS OBSESSED WITH DAISY.  THEY WERE IN LOVE AT ONE POINT, BEFORE HE WENT OFF TO THE WAR.  WHEN GATSBY RETURNS FROM THE WAR, HE HOPES HE WILL BE ABLE TO LOCATEDAISY AND LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER.  WHEN DAISY'S COUSIN NICK IS PUT INTO THE PICTURE GATSBY HAS A CHANCE OF GETTING HIS DREAM BACK.  IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY GETTING WHAT YOU WANT, AND IT CERTAINLY WAS NOT EASY FOR GATSBY.  THE ENTIRE MOVIE AND NOVEL REVOLVE AROUND GATSBY TRYING TO GET DAISY BACK. <br />   I DID NOT REALLY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT OF THE MOVIE.  AFTER WATCHING THE MOVIE, I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED WITH GATSBY'S CHARACTER.  HE WAS SO FAKE TO ME, WHICH I GUESS WAS A LITTLE OF WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO PORTRAY.  IT WAS STILL A LITTLE TO FAKE FOR ME.  DAISY DID A GOOD JOB OF ACTING UPSET.  JORDAN BAKER IN THE NOVEL WAS A VERY CARELESS AND CALM PERSON.  HER CHARACTER IN THE MOVIE WAS JUST LIKE THAT OF THE BOOK.  THE MOVIE WOULD NOT HAD BEEN NEAR AS GOOD WITHOUT NICK.  I THINK HIS PART IN THE MOVIE WAS GREAT.   <br />    THE MOVIE ITSELF IS THE SAME AS THE NOVEL IN THE WAY THAT NOTHING WAS ADDED.  THE MOVIE WAS DIFFERENT FROM THE NOVEL BECAUSE IT LEFT STUFF OUT.  EVERYTNIG EXCEPT THE COLROR OF GATSBY'S CAR WAS ACCURATE.   <br />
B0002KVUMK|3.0|Good special effects, except that they seemed to go a bit over the top for me, especially given what they portrayed the human body as able to do, athletically.  Otherwise, excellent special effects. <br /> <br />Finally, a Dracula that you can 'not like'.  That's a good point.  Excellent portrayal of the Frankenstein 'monster'.  No monster after all, but a misunderstood soul and a kindness to him.  Another good point.  Strange concept of vampires having babies, though (Not to mention how.)  Flies in the face of the very concept of such creatures. <br /> <br />Good story line, with those important, pivotal moments that come unexpectedly.    <br /> <br />However, the sound mixing was terrible!  Dialogue was always mixed in at such a low volume, that I found myself constantly having to turn it up to hear something, only to then suddenly hear _very_ loud sound effects!  I'd then have to race to turn it down again, only for more dialogue to pop up!  Not good for trying to not bother the neighbors.  I had to watch it twice just to finally hear what everybody had been saying. <br /> <br />So that was what interfered with my enjoyment of the movie.  Otherwise, if you love the genre, go for it.
B000002J03|3.0|Led Zep remind me of the game Tomb raider is some ways. Tomb Raider was quite fresh at the time, and it sparked off  a lot of those third person games, which were almost invariably described as \\"Tomb raider wannabes\\" and \\"Tomb raider clones\\" Except.... if people are honest they'll probably realise that Tomb Raider, despite being a good game, has been surpassed by many other games. But being influential it will still be regarded as one of the best games ever. <br /> <br />Similarly, Led Zeppelin sparked off many bands that followed in their footsteps, but again, I still think that other bands have bettered them. People keep talking about this band as if they came from another planet, but come on, they were an electric blues/ folk band. Yes, they were talented musicians, but I wouldn't even consider them as the \\"grestest band ever\\". Certainly, they have their place in rock history, in the same way that Tomb Raider has it's place in gaming history, but there's nothing that makes me want to listen to them all that often. Carve their name in stone if you must, but embark on an exciting jouney by listening to OTHER BANDS...
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Good Ol' Napoleon. Always stays true to himself and friends regardless of the flack he is forced to endure. No major plot to this story, just a few days in the life-  <br /> <br />The honest, no gimmick, flat-affect responses were refreshingly funny.  <br /> <br />At the school dance Napoleon asks, completely void of emotion, \\"So, are you having a good time?\\" Deb responds with a simple unelaborated \\"Yes.\\"  <br /> <br />There is a Sponge-Bob innocence about this movie which I liked; like, life can be a hassle at times, don't expect more. <br /> <br />As a 50+year-old mother of four \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" fans, I get to hear fragments of the script over and over, and it always makes me laugh.      Tina! Eat the Food!  <br />
B000002GY9|5.0|The Piano Has Been Drinking (not me) was the first track I ever heard on this record. It smacked of a Foster Brooks type of comedy.  <br />The rest of this recording was not expected. Tom Waits entered my album collection with \\"favorite\\" status. The sweet melodies and gravel rough vocals mixed to make some of the most memorable (new music to me in 1976) songs I had ever heard. <br />The beautiful mix of thoughtful and clever lyrics and bluesy piano made an indelable impression on my then young mind. <br />Give yourself a chance to get used to this mans voice, then you'll see that his stories in song are sweet, sad, funny, real, and unmistakably Tom Waits.
B0002EXH5O|1.0|Do not buy this version! Parts have been re-recorded! This is not the original album as it's supposed to be! Ozzy Osbourne did this same offense not too long ago and now he's being sued. Stay away! Do not endorse this criminal activity of changing recordings. Buy the original instead!
B0006SSOHC|4.0|\\"Saw\\" is a better movie than most people give it credit for, mostly, I believe, because most people judge it as a horror movie. There aren't a lot of flashy special effects and there is little which passes for gore. Fans of \\"Halloween\\" and \\"Friday the 13th\\" will definitely consider this a substandard horror movie. However, for those who enjoy watching a theatric puzzle come together, like in \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and \\"Reservoir Dogs\\", this movie should prove suspenseful enough to keep your attention for the duration. This is one of those movies where you actually have to pay attention to what is going on and what is being said. If you care about the quality of your movies, you'll enjoy this one.
0767814037|2.0|Sadly, I was not all that impressed by this movie.  The dialogue in this movie leaves much to be desired, and the overall feel of this movie is more along the lines of a made for TV movie.  I have to admit that I'm not an avid Western movie watcher, but still, I've seen many that are much better than Silverado.  I will never waste my time watching this movie again.
B00066N8JS|5.0|With all due respect to the joys of 5.1 Surround sound which I guess *is* the main reason to buy this remastered edition of The Downward Spiral, the improved quality of this remastered version is substantial enough to be noticed even on a meager discman hooked up to a car stereo. Yes, its *that* good.<br /><br />On the other hand, while the quality of this edition is remarkable, if you've been a good collector of Halos, most of the content included in the bonus disc will not be new to you. You own it, in one version or another (maybe even a more interesting version). But still, its very cool to have all of this on one CD.<br /><br />All this said - as happy as I am with this shiny new remastered Deluxe Edition of The Downward Spiral, I suspect that I wouldn't have bothered to purchase it if it weren't my birthday, and had my original copy of TDS not been purchased \\"pre-owned\\".
6304509154|4.0|I watched this movie for the first time when I was fairly young, I think when I was in grade three, which was a year after it came out; it was a sleep-over birthday party, and I'll tell you, I did not sleep much that night.  Most of us didn't, if I recall correctly.  I've seen it a number of times since, and it still gives me the chills, although ultimately, the whole story is outrageous (especially the ending) and has more to do with creating a movie that will draw a large audience than tell a plausible story of a poltergeist haunting.  That is, if such a story can be plausible.  Still, it is one of the better paranormal-themed movies out there and so if you're into that kind of stuff and for some reason haven't seen it, it's worth watching.
B00003CXSM|2.0|I will first off say I did enjoy the movie; I am used to switching my brain off when watching certain types of films; but for this one I had to go three notches lower than I knew existed.   <br />The main plot of the movie is fine, pristine; the sub-plot is what throws the whole thing off kilter.  The sub-plot adds nothing to the story, and destroys the main character.  While functioning in the sub-plot the main character personality becomes homely and stupid, in the main plot she is aggressive and controlling.  It appears to be two characters and two stories combined without regard to their contradictions.  In places it is actually so bad, the movie is forced to cut to another scene before the actors stop and stare into the camera.  <br /> It's witty and somewhat funny but not much more.  <br />
6304233639|3.0|Those reviewers who trash this movie have to relax and not take it so serious: it's just a movie, and first and foremost, its purpose is to entertain.  On the other hand, those reviewers who think this movie is \\"awesome\\" or \\"the greatest movie ever made!\\" really aren't saying much for themselves.  While the special effects are excellent, much about this movie is mediocre or even banal.  I won't bother going into a lengthy discussion on the movie itself--it's been reviewed to death and just about everyone's seen it and has their own opinion.  But I briefly want to touch the whole plausibility of the subject of this movie.  Every time that I've watched it, I invariably wonder what a real alien invasion would be like, and whether we would really be able to do anything about it.  As much as I've thought about it, I've never come to any conclusion other than we're doomed if it should occur.  Clealry, humanity's triumph as depicted in this film and others of the genre is just not going to happen.  I know that's not a revelation, but I wonder sometimes about how much people take these sorts of movies to heart.  All those movies, for instance, where the hero foils terrorist plots etc. and saves the (usually just in the nick of time), in my opinion at least, seem to have conditioned people to believe that what happened on 9/11 wasn't possible.  And so in some ways I tend to think that movies like Independence Day give us a false sense of humanity's ability to deal with such a threat.  But I guess the chances of an alien invasion happening any time soon are quite slim, so I guess its not all that big an issue.  Overall, though, movie is entertaining, and so I'll give it three stars.
068987474X|1.0|I have no pity for women who behave like Desperate Housewives and then get dumped on their butts. This guide, however, may prove enlightening for those women who are clueless when it comes to men. FYI: not for intelligent women.
B0000844I8|5.0|Even though Richard Dean Anderson nor Micheal Shanks is not in this, it is a great action movie. It was nice to see Skaara and his father are both in it. If you love StarGate SG1, you will love this to. Not many extras but a great movie. Watching this movie will help you understand how the SGC and the Stargate started.
B0006GAI6O|4.0|This was an enjoyable movie.  Nothing very deep, but no violence, sex, or other nonsense . . the beginning drags a bit but it makes up for it towards the end of the movie.  Different from the Japanese version . . . watch it for a bit of a diversion.
0385474547|3.0|Things fall apart is a novel about an African man, Okonkwo, in Africa, whose whole world is turned upside down. The ibo people believed in their ancestors and multiple gods. This all changes when missionaries come to Africa and begin comvertiong the Ibo people. The ibos were used to tradition which was disrupted by the white men. <br /> <br />The white men harmed the Ibos more them they helped them. the imperialistic views of the white men ruined African culture and their communitys. They drove some Africans to insanity because they were not accustumed to the white mans ways. But at the same time the white men did moderize there society. <br /> <br />I gave this book three stars because overall it was an ok book. The different traditions and celebrations was interesting to me. They gave me a new outlook on African culture. I did not like it because names were confusing and could become very boring in some parts. I recomend this book to anyone who wishes to learn about African culture.
B00006M183|5.0|Considering they had an extremely hard act to follow since \\"Binaural\\"(some may disagree), Pearl Jam really amazed me with this one. Unlike the former, I INSTANTLY loved this one. From the moment I heard \\"I Am Mine\\" on the radio one day, I knew I was in for YET ANOTHER earth-shattering new Pearl Jam album. I knew from my whole experience with \\"Binaural\\" in particular (see my review), that it wasn't in Pearl Jam's habit to repeat themselves album-wise. So I was expecting something different with \\"Riot Act\\" and a WORLD of difference is what I got. Over-all a slightly more up-beat sounding album than \\"Binaural\\" and just a bit more creative like \\"Yield\\", this impressive album is a real pleasure to listen to. I was genuinely PROUD of my favorite groups 7th installment of legendary music, and I think even the \\"casual\\" listener  will be pleasantly surprised with \\"Riot Act\\", especially if they found \\"Binaural\\" hard to appreciate. While I have grown to LOVE \\"Binaural\\" in time, I LOVED \\"Riot Act\\" in no time. From the mellow and creative opener \\"Can't Keep\\" (which really seems to take you places), to the amazing closer \\"All Or None\\", this incredible album is truly ONE of the bands BEST since \\"Ten\\". The second track, \\"Save You\\", holds it's place among classic Pearl Jam rockers, and \\"Love Boat Captain\\" starts mellow but gradually picks up in classic Pearl Jam style. \\"Cropduster\\" is another great one that really grabs you with it's over-all sound and lyrics. \\"Ghost\\" has got a great beat to it, somewhat along the same line as previous track. Then comes my personal favorite, \\"I Am Mine\\", which is a truly beautiful song about personal security. It really makes you PROUD to be a Pearl Jam fan- it sounds THAT GREAT. Next up is the quiet acoustic \\"Thumbing My Way\\", in which Pearl Jam proves their wide variety of musical ability. And variety's what you get with \\"You Are\\"; it's a breath of fresh air because it's got a totally different sound than anything they've done before. \\"Get Right\\"picks things back up again, and \\"Green Disease\\" is another one of my favorites for it's originality and over-all up-beat sound. \\"Help, Help\\" is a little subdued but it grows on you after a while, and then comes the controversial \\"Bushleaguer\\", in which Vedder trashes Bush. I could care less about politics and I couldn't be any more less interested in politics if I tried, so the song doesn't bother me. But if the lyrics bug you, FORGET them (there are BIGGER things in this world than politics!) and listen to the music and the GREAT riff of the song. Seeing it live was a TREAT. \\"1/2 Full\\" has got that classic raw and hard Pearl Jam sound, \\"Arc\\" is really the album's only filler, if you even want to call it that. To me it sounds beautiful. And keeping up their tradition of GREAT album closers, Pearl Jam ends the album with \\"All Or None\\". I LOVE all of Pearl Jam's albums except \\"Vitalogy\\", I only LIKE that one. And after taking the breath-taking \\"Ten\\" out of the equation because it's on a totally different level, my three most FAVORITE Pearl Jam albums in order are \\"Riot Act\\", \\"Binaural\\", and \\"Yield\\". I just think they get better with every album, and you can't go wrong with \\"Riot ACT\\". Take my word for it- it leaves you hungry for more and anxiously waiting for their next album!   <br />
B00005JNEW|4.0|The fact that this movie is based on the true story of the Permian Panthers from Odessa Texas, (a small town high school football team who threatened greatness) makes it all the more absorbing, but the power of the film lies behind the visual aspects of the sport itself. Like myself, many eschew such comments made in sport such as \\"It's not a matter of life and death, it's more important than that\\" as misguided exuberence, but herein you can see the overwhelming effects and importance placed on sport, particularly in the more insular smaller communities of this nation. The story concerns the aforementioned Permian Panthers and revolves around the coach and a key group of players, their lives, their emotional and physical struggles, and their passion to win. It also exposes the pressures of winning and losing placed upon such young shoulders by their familes, friends, and seemingly the whole town who revere the sport with almost religious fanatiscism. It is uplifting, dramatic, emotionally stirring and compelling to watch, regardless of your sporting allegiances or prior knowledge as we follow their story. Not being a huge football fan I was somewhat sceptical before watching, but found the film to be surprisingly well balanced and un cliched, with a solid if relatively unknown cast. I won't spoil how the movie turns out (although any internet search will provide answers for those who don't like surprises) but recommend it to anyone with a love of drama, as much as sport. This is a slice of real life hometown America (Texas in this instance), and although many outside of the USA especially, may miss the point, it is a sober reflection on the highs and lows of growing up within that environment. Good movie with some factual extras on the DVD as well as the usual trailers and deleted scenes / commentaries etc. Enjoy.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|As if 6.5 awesome albums (Vitalogy's their only WEAK link) wasn't enough for crazed fans, the MIGHTY Pearl Jam gives us a gift for Christmas '03: \\"Lost Dogs\\"! What a TREAT!! I am in complete AWE of this UNBELIEVABLE collection of both old and new Pearl Jam B-sides. And yes, just one CD would make me happy, but they gave us a DOUBLE dose of awesome material, 90% of which should've made all their studio albums!! If you are a TRUE Pearl Jam fan, this is a MUST HAVE, HANDS DOWN! Your PJ collection, no matter how awesome you may think it is, IS NOT COMPLETE without \\"Lost Dogs\\", PERIOD! There are simply too many awesome songs on here to go over, so I'll just randomly pick a few. \\"Sad\\" has got an intense feel to it, from noneother than \\"Binaural\\", \\"Down\\" is a real up-beat song, one that almost made \\"Riot Act\\", \\"Alone\\" is a track that says \\"Ten\\" all over it, \\"You\\" has got a real beautiful sound from the \\"Yield\\" sessions, \\"Whale Song\\" is TRUELY unique and unlike anything else they've ever done, \\"Hold On\\" is one of my favorites from the \\"Vs\\" sessions because it gives me a chill every time, \\"Yellow Ledbetter\\" is a CLASSIC from noneother than \\"Ten\\" that seems to close alot of concerts, \\"Other Side\\" is just touching, \\"Footseps\\" is another classic from the \\"Ten\\" era, \\"Strangest Tribe\\" is plain BEAUTIFUL, \\"Last Kiss\\" is one of the band's most well known covers, and \\"Brother\\" is an AWESOME instrumental. To top all that off, there is also a hidden track at the very end (give it a minute or two) entitled \\"4/20/02\\" (I think) that is a tribute to Layne Stayley. So, that's just a little of what's in store with \\"Lost Dogs\\". Only a FEW are actually songs that you have no problem understanding why they didn't make an album, but that just makes the whole experience interesting. This classic compilation comes with a booklet that has a small story behind each song. And OFCOURSE, you will find that there are ZERO songs from the \\"Vitalogy\\" era (what a RELIEF!). What does that tell you about \\"Vitalogy\\"?? But despite putting out a mediocre album back in '94, the world's GREATEST rock group continues putting out one fantasic album after another, and now we have a double-rarities album to top it all off. \\"Lost Dogs\\" is ESSENTIAL to any serious fan, and I highly recommend it! Some new-comers may not get it at first, but die-hard fans will cherish it forever.
0312335164|4.0|Not as good as \\"Da Vinci Code\\" or \\"Angels & Demons\\", but still excellent and almost impossible to put down.  The other two novels got me planning a trip to Europe, this DID NOT prompt me to go to Fort Meade, Maryland!  Maybe it's because I'm an engineer and not a Catholic, but I was able to solve more of Brown's riddles in this book.  That did not, however, detract from the enjoyment.

1592400876|5.0|It is incredibly uncommon to find a book that is about grammar but, nevertheless, has mass appeal.  Sure, some of us peruse -- and even enjoy -- Strunk and White, but few books have the appeal of, say, _The Transitive Vampire_.  This book does, and with good reason.  Despite Mr. Buston's opinions -- and improper use of English (he's written a different review, to be found here somewhere), this book is a hoot.  Granted, it's written for an English (as opposed to American) audience, and, therefore, a fair bit is off the mark insofar as American usage is concerned (eg., the use of double quotes).  But be that as it may -- the book is rollicking fun, with tongue firmly in cheek, and damn the torpedoes. <br /> <br />While some might view it as a overly cynical, I found it refreshing.  Furthermore, while it's all well-and-good to be a fun book, it's also handy if it is useful, to boot.  And it is.  There is plenty of meat to be had, and those who are wondering exactly why or where an errant apostrophe belongs will likely find the answer in Ms. Truss's book.  [Yes, I know that the \\"s\\" was optional.] <br /> <br />In the immortal words of Douglas Adams, \\"Share and enjoy.\\"
B00004Z400|4.0|This CD is a combination of gloomy songs, strangely happy songs, and the occassional heavy song. To be honest, I can't really call this CD a heavy metal album. Some of the songs are very heavy (\\"Elite, \\"Street Carp\\", \\"Feiticeira\\"), but the majority of the songs on the album would not be classified as heavy metal. There is nothing wrong with the songs not being heavy, but The Deftones are a heavy metal band. So it is a bit strange that the majority of the songs on this album are not heavy. Some of the albums softer tracks such as \\"Digital Bath\\" prove to be decent. On this version of the album, there is an added track entitled \\"Back To School (Mini Maggit)\\". The guitar riffs in the song are very heavy. It is definetely a stand out track on the CD. Definetely get this version, the added track alone is worth the few extra bucks (if this version cost more than the version without the added track, that is). Well, if you are expecting something really heavy, than you'd be better off picking up their new self-titled album or Around The Fur. If not, then pick this CD up.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I would like to grant *****FIVE STARS to the icon place that this movies represent in the film industry.  Although I do have the main complain as others, why aren't the original version available, I saw it as a kid and I don't mind at all, they're like the ones we loved.  Watching this movie retouched is a treat but not a pleasure.   As a casual fan and not a StarWars convention maniac, I do believe too that the original thing should be release in DVD.  That said, I couldn't imagine another space saga that has so much influence in the movies than this one.
B000002GK1|5.0|I love this CD. As soon as I heard the opening track \\"Rusty Cage\\", I knew that this CD would be brilliant. Chris Cornell's vocals are amazing, as usual, which is no suprise. The guitars are also finely tuned, as usual. This is one of the earlier and heavier albums. \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\" is byfar my favorite song on the CD. Other standout tracks include \\"Outshined\\" (which features an insanely heavy opening riff, that is played again throughout the song), \\"Face Polution\\", \\"Holy Water\\", \\"New Damage\\", and \\"Searching With My Good Eye Closed\\" (my second favorite song on the CD). Pick this one up along with Louder Than Love, another classic Soundgarden album.
B0006284JQ|5.0|Is unfair to Miss Spears to say that she's not an acomplished performer or singer.  It's true that Britney is not a high note vocalist, but is only fair to agree that she knows were her range is and follow the right marketing path.  Her body,  danceable music and scandalous persona is quite enough to keep her on the media hot spot.  None of her other contemporary peers could achieve the press that she got(Please I aprecciate Aguilera and Lavigne music, but they just well don't have that type of pos. and neg. press).  Now to the music, is a fact that this Louisiana Girl find it kind of hard to position her singles in the radio and Billboard chart, only 4 single manage to arrive at the top 10.  Many people then will think is odd to have an Greatest Hits when songs like BOYS & I'M NOT A GIRL NOT YET A WOMAN got stuck Under the 100, and others like OVERPROTECTED, OUTRAGEOUS didn't go further than #79 position, but you see it was not about the charts, it was about the charisma and attitude that made this songs hits, in video, and in the media in general.  The collection starts with the Bobby Brown cover MY PREROGATIVE, Spears accerted more acurately than Lohan, at asking to leave her alone, because is obvious that she is more targeted than the RUMOURS lady, although is hard to define the cover of a late 90's SWING classic, if she pretended to have a JUSTIFY MY LOVE in her first collection of hits, she failed the test, cos an original song will have fairly done well.  TOXIC this is an example that Britney knew she was getting to far from the mainstream music, selling music only for her not for her songs.  TOXIC enbodies all that a great POP tune should have creative sounds, clever lyrics, and different tone of voice. A winner on her career.  I'M A SLAVE 4 U a Neptune produced track, although it was her departure from the pop sweden sound, her chorus line sounded a lil faked and not real, but her performance in the MTV awards and the explosive video made this track performe averagely at #27.  OOPS I DID IT AGAIN, you can see that she eagers for love but she has no pun intended, she's not nice, she's just like that...a classic(that already sounds dated), but not a song you want to agree you  <br />enjoy.  ME AGAINST THE MUSIC i don't have mixed feelings a bout this song. this is totally a great POP song, the lyrcis are fast and slick, the music is danceable, and Madonna is flawless, shouldn't have been big.  STRONGER the video was colorfully melancolic, and it gave the song the mood that it search, her lonely supposedly was not killing her no more, but by these days Britney seems to achieve another character a more mature and politically incorrect.  EVERYTIME, I personally think that Britney Spears is not a balladear, and this was the first song I dismissed  when I listen to her last album, but after they over played it at the radio after the success of TOXIC, well I ended given it a soft spot in my music brain, the video for this songs, it's critical for her life, but one of the worst since FTBOMYH(wich gladly is NOT included here).  ...BABY ONE MORE TIM, do I need to say more, this is a CLASSIC.  CRAZY STOP!, she's this is her second classic fit, and it's a delight to included the video version here. BOYS one of the best tracks of the third album, the remix is so funky.  SOMETIMES, one of the most dated singles from Spears, sounds too much a like with the BSB c..., skip this one.  Is corny, cheesy, weak. OVERPROTECTED a nice track, althought the original is superior to this DARKCHILD remix, okay by this time you knew already that she wanted space, maybe nobody understood, or she didn't want to let go, so three years later came PREROGATIVE.  LUCKY this is the cheeeeeeesiest but EXTREMES makes sometimes the right track.....you can't top this self pitty song. CREAM OF THE CROP. OUTRAGEOUS another explanation of her daily basis, R KELLY bouncy sound make this a dancefloor delight of LOVE MY LIFE.  I'M NOT A GIRL NOT YET A WOMAN should have been left out, not a nice track, intimate maybe, but boring a not crusial. Why did DIDO got involved in such a song, such a waste of time.  HAVING MY FUN you'll think you know the beat, but not the lyrics.  DO SOMETHIN' Gwen stefani singing alike song, not her best but at least an original.  The first Greatest Hits of Britney Spears show the transcision from southern gil to shameless woman.  It's nice to have them collected in one since her first three album are not consistent masterpieces, you can sell them, buy this and kept the last one that sold less than the first but at least is the more mature and offers more creativity to her music.  *****FIVE STARS for puttin' out this collection, and for doin' what she wants.
B0001LJCMK|4.0|This is a good rock album.  No, it has nothing to do with the Eagles, or with death metal.  Rather, the name is a reference to a band member's friend.  They were talking about the Eagles (the real Eagles) and their friend made the all-too-intelligent comment, \\"Oh, aren't they that one death metal band?\\"  So the name is a joke, like the music.  They don't take themselves seriously- this is a side project after all.  But it is good music, assuming you like tuned down guitars and the fuzzy production that Homme uses so often.  Him and his desert and all his crazy drugs.  Josh, youre so crazy.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|The last review was so typical. The people who don't like the movie are people who can't read between the lines, see anything beneath the surface and have no idea that art comes upon you secretly. A group of friends and I saw this movie again for the first time since 2001. This time we did a meditation group and disucssion group buddhist and christian elements in the movie. A friend said that the discussion began here but I can't find it. Anyway, there is so much more here than what the reviewer says. I mean, what other movie that's 3 years old has a devoted fan club that meets once a month due to powerful religious elements?
0385510454|3.0|As many others have written in their reviews, Grisham's novels had progressively worsened over time. I was nervous to buy this book and come away again with the feeling that I had wasted money. While this book has some flaws and is nowhere near the type of book that made Grisham wildly popular, it is in my opinion much better than his last few books. <br /> <br />I, unlike others here, enjoyed the time the story takes place in Italy. Through The Broker we get to see the Italy most of us will never see. We learn about the importance of food and wine in the Italian culture, not to mention a great deal of simple Italian. There is also the occassional history lesson to further educate us of his surroundings. We have seen and heard through countless books and movies the dark side of Washington; it is refreshing to have the book take place in an area of the world few of us will ever experience. <br /> <br />As for the downside, I never really felt that Marco was really in danger or that the net was really closing in on him. I didn't get the sense of being involved in a chase, nor did I ever feel that Grisham truly developed a true sense of suspense. Furthermore, I felt the ending was rushed and that it lacked adequate closure.  <br /> <br />If you are a fan of Grisham and have read many of his novels, I believe this book will be an upgrade from his previous few books. However, if you are wondering what all the fuss about Grisham is about, do not start with this book. His earliest books are much, much better.
B0002S947K|5.0|This is the first review I have written for Amazon, although I have been ordering from Amazon for a long time.  This is one of the most unbelievable albums I have ever heard.  Imagine Tom Waites' raspy haunting voice, Damien Rice's heartbreaking lyrics, and the passion of Otis Redding.  Man, this album lingers.  Just damn fine honest stuff.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am no fanboy, and not much of a science fiction buff, but this show is absolutely addicting.  Even if you don't like the sci-fi western premise, the charm of the characters and the brilliant dialogue will draw you in and not let go.  Shame on FOX for cancelling such a uniquely appealling mix of humor, drama, action, and romance.  Counting the days til the movie comes out.....
B00005JNJ7|5.0|I loved it!  It gave political corretness, from both the right and side left side of the political spectrum a much overdue and much needed kick square in the teeth!
0064407667|5.0|Yes, if you wish to escape the sweetness and light of the Harry Potter generation this very well may be your portal.  Written in the best English childhood storytelling style, this is all quite witty and wicked at the same time.   <br /> <br />Disturbingly wicked at times.  Threatened infanticide, child abuse, and attempted statutory rape are not exactly topics you want to expose younger children or the over-impressionable to.  But face it.  Violet, Klaus, and Sunny would hever reach their potential without good 'ol Count Olaf to spur them along.  He's the villain that too many stories need (including the aforementioned HP) but never get. <br /> <br />At this writing I have not read past the first volume, and I am wondering how thin the subject matter will get by the tenth.  My unfortunate event is now I will have to find out!
0765301598|2.0|I read the \\"Prelude to Dune\\" series and liked it enough to go for the \\"Legends of Dune\\" series. It wasn't great, and it was nowhere near the level of the original Dune novel, a lot lighter and fluffier than the rest of the original Dune series.  That's fine, everything can't be a masterpiece... But the latest and last book of the \\"Legends\\" series was worse than that. I hesitate to call it crap, but it did little more than dispoint.  All of the institutions we know in Dune- the Bene Gesserit, the Fremen, the Atreides/Harkonnen feud, the Guild, the Suk School, the extreme demand for spice, and the Mentats were all conveniently founded and formed in the last half of this book.  Hundreds of years of history between the end of this book and the events of Dune; also, hundreds of years before this book for the League to develop. And *bam* here we go. I know it's fiction, but it would've been far from impossible to make it believable fiction. This may appeal to those who like a lot of lame space battles and flat characters, though.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|...are absolutely true!  I am a lifelong Trekker - have been watching Star Trek since '68 - but I have to say that aside from a couple of brilliant seasons of TNG, ST totally can't hold a candle to the incredible writing and acting of Firefly.  Firefly even makes X-Files look a little slow. <br /> <br />I'm still a Trekker, but I would not shell out money to buy a ST DVD, whereas I would, if I had to, give up a couple of meals to buy a Firefly DVD!  :)  You won't regret owning it.
B000002KXV|2.0|I have to admit that I liked this LP when it first came out in '82, but I outgrew it. It just didn't \\"age\\" very well. There are still some things to like. New Frontier is the best song, and I enjoy the Lettermen-like vocal arrangements Fagan uses here and there. (Such harmonies are the same ones Brian Wilson grew up with; the ones that influenced his Beach Boys compositions) But Fagan's The Nightfly is like a wine cooler: thin and dated. It's okay as far is it goes (and that's not very far) but not satisfying for more sophisitcated tastes. If you must have beginner's jazz in your system, get Steely Dan's Aja instead. Better songs, tastier arrangements, better band leadership--it's simply a more rewarding collection of music.
0385720920|3.0|Chuck Palahniuk is a great writer, but I found Choke to be an \\"uncomfortable\\" read from beginning to end.  In Choke almost every character is physically or mentally disturbed but described carefully and perfectly.  The protagonist is a sex addict, written about in such detail that you many never want to have sex again. Based on his upbringing you understand why he is the way he is.  YOu understand too much.  His best friend is prob. the most disgusting character ever written about (the protagonist is runner-up).  Their  mucus, filth, smell, dirt, blocked bowels, release of blocked bowels, are described in full glory.<br /><br />The plot of the book involves the main character faking his death by choking in various restaurants around town.  The people that save him, pity him and want to help later by sending him checks to subsidize him.  I had a problem with this. I would think that someone doing the saving would be the one getting paid back, not the other way around.<br /><br />The ending of the book has a decent twist, but I was on the fence whether it was interesting or convenient for the author.<br /><br />The book as stated before was very well written, but not for me at this time.  I can understand the range of ratings Choke has thus far received.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I loved this movie.  Joe Schumacher did a marvelous job in picking the cast and creating a movie which far surpasses any theatrical version I've ever seen.  He did so much more with the movie than one could ever do on stage.  He picked the perfect pair to play the Phantom and Christine.  One has to read the book to see why Gerard and Emmy were so in tune with the book version and Gaston Leroux's Phantom and the love of his life.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves beautiful music, great cinematography, and a poignant love story which is for the ages.
6301942647|3.0|I just examined a 35mm print, and can confirm that fellow reviewer P.A.G. Fessel and the IMDB have wrong information about the aspect ratio. This film was composed for the 1.85:1 ratio, and that is the way it was shown theatrically.  I have submitted a correction to the IMDB. <br /> <br />Not one of Kurosawa's best in my opinion, anyway.  Still often quite fascinating.
B0002234LS|5.0|First off, let me tell you that this is my favorite movie, I have no idea how it got any bad ratings at all, I truly and honestly don't. Well, I guess one possibility would be that they don't understand it, but that's only because it has a very elaborate, complex plot, and an amazing one at that. It's creepy enough to keep you awake, it is definitely suspensful enough to keep you entertained, it even has one short fight scene, and on top of it all, it has a few humorous scenes as well. You just cannot go wrong with this movie.
B0002858YS|5.0|i like all kinds of music but i usually only like 1 or 2 songs from a cd and its a waste of money to buy the whole cd. but i previewed the tracks at the store before i bought it and i can say i love each and every song on the cd, its the first cd ever that i actully play from begining to end.
0789723107|5.0|when reading a technical book.  You will find yourself busting out with \\"that's so true it's hilarious\\" laughter fits.  It is truly amazing to me how we can be such \\"designer's and engineers\\" when building our own websites, but such \\"end users\\" when using other's websites.  I have always had the \\"Don't make me think\\" frustration underlying many website (and software for that matter) experiences and frequently my website feedback and reviews would reflect this sentiment. <br /> <br />This book will prove itself to you because Steve causes you to draw on your own experiences as a web user to understand what your users want from your site.
0375703764|5.0|I've just finished reading a novel that, for me, redefines HOW a book <br />can be written. It is called \\"House of Leaves\\" by Mark Z. <br />Danielewski. It is nearly impossible to describe WHAT it is about, <br />and even more difficult to explain HOW it is presented. If anyone is <br />in the mood for something totally different, this could be your <br />ticket. However, at 700+ pages (and many of them infuriatingly <br />detailed) it is not an \\"easy\\" read. This is a love/hate book the <br />likes of which I have never seen. <br /> <br />A synopsis is nearly impossible. Most reviews I have read relate as <br />much. As best I can descibe it, \\"House of Leaves\\" begins with a story <br />written by a fictional character named Zampano. Early on, Zampano (an <br />80 year old, blind, house-bound nutcase) dies under mysterious <br />circumstances. Throughout the latter part of his life, Zampano was <br />obsessed with writing a fictional story called \\"The Navidson Record.\\" <br />This story is written in almost essay form, about the fictional <br />accounts of a family that moves into a rural home in the Virginia <br />countryside where very strange things occur. The head of the family, <br />Will Navidson (a professional photojournalist,) recorded every <br />indescribable/impossible event that transpired in their house. As <br />Zampano's story goes, the recorded events were turned into an <br />international hit docu-drama movie (think Blair Witch Project). <br />Zampano creates an entire universe of people who have supposedly seen <br />this movie, and have written articles, books, thesis and subsequent <br />films about that film. There are hundreds of footnotes, endnotes and <br />quotes attributed to both real and fictional people who supposedly <br />have seen this movie. <br /> <br />Along comes another character named Johnny Truant. Truant discovers <br />Zampano's unfinished, and painfully disorganized manuscript, and <br />feels compelled to translate, organize and explain what he has found. <br />Johnny Truant is by far, the single most perfect observance into <br />total insanity I have ever seen. The more obsessed he becomes with <br />attempting to understand Zampano's story, the further into the abyss <br />we watch Truant fall. <br /> <br />The book often presents Zampano's academic essay and Truant's run-on <br />ramblings on the same page, for pages at a time, in simultaneous <br />narrative, that shapes the text to conform to the mindset of <br />whichever author rules the page. (Some pages have only one paragraph, <br />sentence or word. Some pages have four or five running footnotes that <br />continue for 10 or more pages - backwards, forwards, or even <br />requiring a mirror to read.) Some sentences run on for two, three or <br />more pages. <br /> <br />The central focus of the story is anyone's guess. However, the theme <br />tends to relate back to the definition of TRUE darkness and <br />emptiness, and I mean total and complete. There are diagrams, poems, <br />letters from mothers in insane asylums, and supposed quotes from <br />people such as Steven King, Camille Paglia, Ken Burns and countless, <br />countless others. <br /> <br />If you ever see the book on your travels, take a couple of minutes to <br />flip through the pages. IMHO, it is the work of pure genius. I am <br />dumbfounded that ONE person could write this. There are DETAILED <br />references to biblical scripture, ancient Greek mythology, scientific <br />studies of sound and echo, and an almost thorough knowledge of all <br />things knowable. <br /> <br />As I feared, describing WHAT this book is has made me sound as insane <br />as the characters in it. I will stop now. Investigate further at your <br />own peril. But beware: this could one day be you! :-) <br />
068987474X|5.0|I'm just upset that I didn't find this book before I found a wonderful guy.  I use this book to counsel my friends because when you're in the middle of a bad situation, you can't see clearly.  The title makes it sound insulting, but it is actually empowering.  It constantly reminds women that we don't need to read into every single thing that guys do.  Sometimes he's just not worth it and we should move on.  Written in a very lighthearted, funny way.  I highly reccommend to single women and especially their best friends.
B00007L4MJ|4.0|Fritz Lang's Metropolis turned out to be overall very entertaining and successful. I started watching the movie without very high expectations because of the fact that there were no speaking roles. Despite this, Alfred Abel did an incredible job acting as Johhan Fredersen and Gustav Fr&ouml;hlich as Freder Fredersen. I learned that you don't need words in a movie to make it a good movie.<br /><br />Metropolis starts off with a bunch of men working in an organized, \\"mechanical\\" form. We are soon introduced to Freder who's hanging around beautiful women. Soon he meets Maria, who is bringing children to the garden to work. Freder is attracted to Maria and soon descends to where the workers are. He witnesses an explosion when a worker collapses and takes his place. He then realizes that Maria is a lead worker. She tells him that there will be someone who will come and save them from the machines. Freder's father has other plans. With the help of the scientist Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) they plan to replace the workers with robots and decide to start with Maria.<br /><br />Like every movie this one had its ups and downs. Overall in this film, I feel the \\"ups\\" outweighed the \\"downs\\". I thought the acting was superb even though there were no words. The quote \\"actions speak louder than words\\" could definitely describe Metropolis. The actors did a great job in their dramatic gestures and making their movements big so people could clearly grasp the concept and emotions they were trying to convey.<br /><br />A weaker side of the movie was the scenes that seemed to drag on forever. I lost interest in some scenes and found it hard to focus/follow at times. That is basically the only down point I found in the film.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this film. I would recommend it more for the learning purposes rather than the entertaining purposes. Watching this film today will show how much technology has grown and increased over the years and help us appreciate film for whatit is today.
B0002JJBZY|4.0|Don't get me wrong - I love the old gen. Love, love the old Gen. The transfers? Great - didn't have a problem there. The packaging? Yeah, the inside sleeve was a little cheap but otherwise - smooth sailing. And the extras? Outstanding. <br /> <br />BUT. <br /> <br />Why, why are they making us shell out all the big time cabbage for this set? Compared to other season sets, you have to mortgage your house to buy this one. They don't even give you anything special for buying the whole set other than wrapping them all together in a little cardboard sleeve. And it's bad enough Paramount is making a major cash grab...I discovered the other day that there are other extras that they've included on European sets BUT not the North American one.  <br /> <br />They include: <br />  <br />Kiss & Tell - Romance In The 23rd Century (8:19): William Shatner and story editor Dorothy Fontana talk about the multitude of women that Kirk managed to get 'involved' with during the course of the show. Also includes Nichelle Nichols talking about some suggestive scenes between Uhura and Scotty and Walter Koenig talks about the revealing costumes the actresses wore on the show. <br /> <br />Trekker Connections (3:42): A little game for the viewer to play with cast members like six degrees of Kevin Bacon. <br /> <br />Star Trek's Favourite Moments (17:09): Cast and crew members from the newer shows such as Michael Dorn (TNG), Ethan Philips (Voy), John Billingsley (Ent), Jeffrey Combs (DS9), Vaughn Armstrong (Ent), Robert O'Reilley (TNG) and Tim Russ (Voy) talk about their memories of the show. <br /> <br />Collectible Trek (14:26): Paramount archivist Penny Juday talks about the money that some people will pay for genuine Star Trek collectibles. <br /> <br />Considering the serious gouging, it wouldn't have killed them to stuff these on here. There's also trailers for The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager DVD sets they didn't include but that's just as well since there's disclaimersto sell Trek DVD product all over the DVDs. I bought the set, they have my money and now they want more of it? <br /> <br />All in all, it is a tremendous set, considering the major cash you had to spend before buying all the episodes individually. It just would've been nice to see Paramount really roll back the price tag and roll out the red carpet for the Trek fans who've been lining their pockets all these years.  <br />
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I was reluctant to see this movie because it has Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom in it and I thought that it would ruin the historical value of the movie, but everyone tole me how good it was, so I decided to rent it. <br />I was blown away, I absolutly loved it. Brad Pitt of course was georgous and sexy, and played a very good Achilles. This movie showed how things used to be, women treated with respect,women unashamed of thier bodies,and sex was something that people were not afraid of and were not taught to wait until until you are married, (sex is the most natural thing humans do.) Men powerful, protective, and respectful of thier women, and of course sexy. Then men back then were not lazy bums like most of them are now. I highly recommend this movie to everyone, maybe the men can take some tips on how to love a woman.
B000001YOW|5.0|Being a person who is constantly searching for new music from all corners of the globe, I have been stunned by the sheer brilliance of Porcupine Tree's effort on Signify.  This album has it all.  The song writing is very unique, and the music which it accompanies is right on the money.  They kind of remind me of Pink Floyd in their earlier years.  I just took delivery of Signify and The Sky Moves Sideways two days ago, and I cannot stop listening to them.   This is the type of music just grabs hold of you, and sweeps you up into another realm.  Truly a MUST HAVE for people who like to expand their musical horizons - away from what the \\"mainstream\\" radio shoves down our throats.
0670033693|3.0|The Cold Dish is a decent first attempt by this author. The premise of the book is that one of a group of boys who brutally raped a Native American/Indian girl with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome turns up murdered. What follows is the investigation of the crime, the narrator's gradual narrowing of the suspects, and the race to stop more murders. Side stories of the book include the author's personal struggle/development as he works to move past his wife's death three, no, four years ago, as well as the relationships between the townpeople and the nearby Native American/Indian population (it helps to know that the author himself is very familiar and friendly with the Native Americans/Indians in his community, as it might be distracting to some people to read some of the politically incorrect parts of the book dealing with Native Americans/Indians - this is why I'm using both terms!).<br /><br />Mr. Johnson clearly knows his subject matter (crime, law enforcement, Wyoming, small towns, Native Americans/Indians) very well, which is definitely a plus of the book. He also does a superb job of describing the landscape (although not the town as much), which helps establish the sometimes wild, sometimes mystic atmosphere of the book. The book is also somewhat humorous, but unfortunately not as much as it was intended to be. The flaws in this book come with the pace of the plot and how readily a reader gets involved. The plot takes a long time (possibly half the book) to really get moving. It's possible that this helps with the feeling of frustration Longmire, the sheriff, has with the pace of his investigation or that it's reflective of the pace of life in a small town in the West. I, however, found myself getting distracted and wanting to skip ahead. Also, I did not really find myself emotionally invested in the book. The most emotional moment for me was a scene between Melissa Little Bird and Longmire, somewhat toward the end of the book; that was the only time I found myself feeling twinges of emotion. Some of the characters are well done, some seem too minor (like the author intended them to be more full but their parts were edited and watered down). However, I couldn't shake the feeling that many of the characters were very deliberate, very purposeful in their personalities, words, and actions. Finally, I was very surprised at the identity of the murderer, which was a good thing, but I couldn't help thinking that it was too much of a surprise. I don't read many mysteries, but I have gathered that part of the fun of reading a mystery is that there are cleverly hidden clues that an astute reader can piece together to solve the mystery - I didn't feel that anyone could have seen the end coming, although I could be wrong.<br /><br />From attending a book reading with the author, I know that he intends to make this into a series of books. I am interested to read his next book to see how he develops and expands his voice.feeling twinges of emotion.

B000002UR7|5.0|I cannot begin to understand why people must fuss over how \\"immature\\" Radiohead was back then. They had a lot of energy, and they certainly made good use out of it. As Radiohead started changing into a progressive, electronic, experimental band, I found myself losing intrest in their music. My favorite part of Radiohead will always remain on the rock side. If you loved \\"The Bends\\" then you will love (well certainly like alot) \\"Pablo Honey.\\" Definitly a must.
B00005V3Z4|1.0|Perhaps I went into this movie with unreasonably high expectations, after all everyone who has seen this movie has put it on a pedestal. The movie's fairly boring, mainly because the pacing is slow and the narrative is drawn out to an unnecessary degree (how many scenes of Donnie walking, of Donnie pouting, of Donnie sitting do you really need to see?). However this is not the source of my intense revulsion of this movie. I am a fairly intelligent individual, but I could not figure out the central storyline. I had my own conjectures of what was happening but I decided that perhaps, if I looked at the extras I might be able to understand what the director was getting at. One of the extras on this DVD is an excerpt from \\"The Philosophy of Time Travel\\" book (from which Donnie draws his theories) and in three pages it outlined what was going on, what Frank (the bunny) was, the significance of the airplane engine, the concept of a \\"tangent\\" universe, why Donnie dreams of a water filled landscape, why everyone is trying to stop Donnie (even if they're not aware they're doing it), the black hole at the end, and well...everything. I was confused as to why the director chose to leave these explanations out and conceal the context for the story (SOME WOULD SAY THE CENTRAL CORE OF THE STORY THAT DRIVES EVERYTHING ELSE). I turned to the deleted scenes to see if any of these details had been cut from the movie intentionally and maybe, just maybe if there was a reason why they where cut. Here is where confusion turned to a personal hatred of the director. All of the deleted scenes added vital revelations (more conversations with Frank!, Donnie was taking placebos not actual medication! ect!) and at least a sense of what was going on with whole time travel aspect. What put me over the edge was hearing the director go on and on about this scene was cut because it revealed too much, that he preferred to leave it open to the viewer. I like some ambiguity in my movies, but I don't like a story that is forcibly divorced from context. Watching this movie is akin to reading a book with pages torn out; pages torn out by a pompous, conceited director who believes that a broken, shattered story is inherently better then a film with a complete narrative.  It is this attitude, this mental masturbation (smart people don't need context or explanations, only dumb people and philistines need narrative clarity) that turns this boring, muddled movie into a nexus of disgust and hatred. Do not watch this movie. But most of all do not support this self-important, vain, smug, arrogant, snobbish, haughty, ostentatious ass of a director by buying this movie.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Arcade Fire's \\"Funeral\\" should be called \\"birth\\" since this is the start of something great.  I bought this album because Amazon recommended it but I did the right thing because this is a wonderful album that really shows the artfulness of modern music.  It is well thought sincere and shows progressive use of sundry influences that makes for a delightful listen.  The songs are instantly accessible yet aren't cheap \\"gimmicky\\" pop tracks.  Arcade Fire is new to me but certainly one of the best current acts.  I expect future greatness from them. <br /> <br />Breaking open with the dream like ethereal \\"Tunnels\\" the albums lulls the listener into its captivating sound.  I instantly thought of the Cocteau Twins while listening and while the vocals are reminiscent of Modest Mouse they are certainly something unto their own.  \\"Crown of Love\\" was another track that really resonated with me and I heard again many influences most especially \\"the Talking Heads (which is heard throughout the work).  Lastly \\"Rebellion (Lies)\\" is worthy of note.  I really like this one.  It is quiet and yet driving. <br /> <br />\\"Funeral\\" is a worthy album on many levels and certainly will do well with the fans of Franz Ferdinand and Modest Mouse etc.  I found the music especially delicate and many of the tracks have an M Ward feel.  The nice thing about this album is that it is intelligent while still being good crowd music.  I highly recommend this one and think that Arcade Fire will be a band to watch. <br /> <br /> <br />Ted Murena

Whole trying to find her way back to civilization Trisha encounters a countless number of strange and unordinary things, such as a dead deer who seems to have died in a very unusual way. Something seems to be stocking this young girl in the woods and being lost doesnt seem like here only problem. This by far was not one of Kings best works, it was far diffrent from his shocking, gorry writing style that most of his books have. The ending of the book was very dissapointing and there were a lot of loose ends that were never really tied up. All and all the basic story and plot wasnt bad, but the ending really ruined the book for me. I would still reccomend this book, but be warned the ending ruins it.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I grew up with hard core punk, and I've been listening to music long enough to smell a sell out a mile away. This CD is neither of these things. This CD is a well inspired collection of songs with wonderful experimental elements. When you listen to a CD and it sounds new, interesting and really like nothing else, how can you in good faith call it a sellout? Isn't a sellout making some cookie cutter, uninspired, production just to lure fans into spending their money based on a band's name on the CD cover? Well, this CD is not THAT CD. It's excellent. It appeals to a huge audiance, as it should. Enough with the whining about \\"selling out\\".
B00005JMAH|3.0|Ok...I'm one of those terrible people who does not read the Harry Potter series of books but instead watches the movies.  I'm sorry! <br /> <br />This, the third installment of the Harry Potter movies, WAS ok, but not as good to me as the first two. This must have been a very complex book, because they just tried to do too much in the plot of this one. <br /> <br />I did enjoy it because Harry ends up learning much more about his parents through the addition of some other characters, including a surprise one or two.  I especially liked his \\"connection\\" with the Prisoner of Azkaban, which ends up being sort of a plot twist. <br /> <br />It'll be interesting to see where they go from here with the movies, because overall I enjoyed myself.  It DID just seem a bit crammed.
B0000844I8|5.0|The more I see this film, the more it confirms  how much I like it. As a film, I see it primarily as a romance. In the end, a man out of place in one world, finds his place in another, and one man finds meaning in his own world after a very traumatic event. The central force is the romance that one finds in a place across the Galaxy.  Comparing the Film with TV series is not worth it. The TV series is rightly stated as \\"MacGyver Versus the Stargate\\", since that is what it is set up to be. The film, however, is a stand-alone masterpiece.  Emmerich and Devlin team up, and produce a film that works on many levels. You can enjoy the many extras on the discs, however, the Von Danikan add-ons are just fluff. The heart of this film is an excellent script. The soul of it lies in the performers, and the performances.  You will probably notice some Emmerich staples, such as some truly superb performers who have appeared in other films by Emmerich and co.  The Sound on the DVD  is excellent, and despite some very minor, but incredibly obvious continuity mistakes, the story works. There has not been an intergalactic romance like this since FORBIDDEN PLANET, and both  STARGATE and FORBIDDEN  PLANET are excellent films, each ahead of their time, and both immensely for any fan of the genre.
B00003CXRM|3.0|I saw this movie last Saturday and I think it has one of the most originally amusing scenes to start the film with.The movie has three well defined characters.I'll speak more about them.<br /><br />The movie recreates the distant past in a way quite extraordinary.I think its a travellor's movie and the three run into a lot of characters. I laughed out loud while watching two scenes in the film.I liked the mini Satan show. Those who've seen the movie just might follow what I said.Enjoyed the Baptism bit and I think the music played throughout the film is quite inspiring and adds to the mood of the movie.<br /><br />Where the movie lacked was in coming to the conclusion.I wasn't too impressed with the flood scene. The last scene in the film with the blind man on the railway tracks was moving in a way.<br /><br />Overall, this film is the kind I wont give a second watch anytime in the near future. It made me realise Clooney isnt a bad actor and the character who played \\"George Nelson\\" was my favourite(short role)though. I liked the cars and cows collision too.Replayed it thrice.Can't make out whether its special effects or not.<br />Well Done , Coen's
B000002MUN|4.0|Tom Petty had apparently put out a second solo effort, the follow-up to his honey of an lp 'Full Moon Fever'. 'Wildflowers' has fifteen cuts, most of which carry their weight on the disc rather well. Tunes I found myself sort of tapping my toes to were the Petty-esque \\"You Don't Know How It Feels\\", \\"Time To Move On\\", the Dylan-like \\"Honey Bee\\", \\"To Find A Friend\\" and \\"Wake Up Time\\". Don't just assume this CD isn't going to be any good because the Heartbreakers aren't mentioned in the artist's name - for this release rocks! In fact, I could see Petty including several of these songs in his live sets. Ever see Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers play live? They're not to be missed. Old fashioned well-written rock & roll, as with most Petty albums. A nice find.
B0000BXGCN|5.0|I bought this based on a review I read here from someone who said he speaks no French but loved this anyway. On faith, I did the same - bought it, and have really loved it -- Lara could sing my grocery list and make a symphony of it. Even if you speak no French, you'll really enjoy watching her in this small intimate concert, where she sings in Italian, French, and even English. She is one gorgeous woman!
B0006A9FMI|1.0|Why I gave this movie a chance after the original's complete and utter failure, I have no idea.  It's filled with computer-animated graphics; way to start off on the wrong foot there.  CG is total garbage.  You can't relate with the main character, because he is devoid of personality.  The plot is random at best; and everyone is chock-full of 'wise-old-man' sayings.  If that isn't enough to make you vomit, the soundtrack (copied straight from the original) will.  If your lucky you'll fall asleep like I did and wake up when the torment, er...movie, is over.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|First of all, Nicole Kidman puts forth a brilliant performance in this movie. From a spoiled young girl of wealth to one who quickly has nothing and has to learn some very tough lessons about survival, she comes through with flying colors.    I could feel her pain and the pain of her love who so desperately tries to return to her. Not uncommon, for the bond of true love is strong. Gripping scenes throughout kept my interest. Excellent example of friendship from those whom we least expect it. Renee Zellweger is a favorite and was a delight to watch her in this extraordinary role.    But the end was not what I expected. Definately worth seeing.     Gail Gupton, Author: The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment and Seekers of Truth.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Okay, maybe my previous review of one amazing line is not enough, so I shall write longer. <br /> <br />The Clash is an amazing band which my brother got me listening to. I don't care if its rock or its punk, its just good music that is worth a good listen if you actually want to know what real rock sounds like. Amazing and awesome. <br /> <br />Give it a try and try not to get hooked onto it. I shall applaud you.
6305308659|5.0|Two Thumbs Up for this excellent spiritual plot about waking up to reality. By 'reality' I mean wake up and 'smell the coffee' or wake up and 'smell the roses'.     Our world often seems to be living in Pleasantville as society (most especially religion) deems laws and rules that prevent one from advancing their knowledge and curiosity. Since many other reviewers have disclosed the plot, I won't have to. Therefore, I'll just add my comments.    The movie made me laugh and smile and gave me a sense that the director really had a hold of something subtley worthwhile. As people became 'enlightened' their appearances changed. Isn't that what happened to Moses? But this movie is set in the 1950s era, which makes it one of innocence and pure enjoyment. All rolled into one great theme, Pleasantville is a winner! A+ roles for Tobey McQuire, William Macy, Reese Witherspoon, and Jeff Daniels.    I loved it. My late husband loved it. We watched it a number of times, always getting the same warm enjoyment and I'll continue to do so as the years go by. My personal opinion is that this movie is a Classic.

B0001UL7RY|5.0|A big Avril fan, I admit Avril Lavigne was a poseur who stretched her punky image too far during the course of the first album, but this album absolutely screams WOW! <br /> <br />Produced by Don Gilmore who helmed Linkin Park, Raine Maida; smashing vocalist of rock band Our Lady Peace, Butch Walker; someone I don't know much about but produced great songs, and written by Avril Lavigne with help from Chantal Kreviuzak (correct? I dunno how to spell her name. sorry.) and Raine Maida.  <br /> <br />I loved this album sooo much I am still not sick from listening to it since May 25 2004. Avril puts up a brave and angst ridden front in this album, evolving from easy acoustics on the first album to hard licking guitars, soothing piano, and drumbeats full of energy.  <br /> <br />The album opens with a track not too favoured by me, called 'Take Me Away', which provides a very rough image. I didn't like this song very much, but it quickly moved on to one of the best songs I have ever heard, titled 'Together'. The start of this song has Chantal Kreviuzak (is that how you spell it?) and Avril Lavigne on the piano, and then soon the heartbreaking chorus soon spills out, revealing a very emotional Avril Lavigne.  <br /> <br />Further on, you come across memorable tracks like 'How Does It Feel?' a very surly track with surly melodies and sad feel, and the heartwarming 'Slipped Away' a song dedicated to Avril's grandfather who passed away during the recording of this album, and 'He Wasn't' a naughty loud  and personally one of my favourite tracks which has Avril complaining while guitar pounding and riffs go on. Also included are powerful tracks like 'My Happy Ending' which, i cannot describe with proper words, just absolutely SMASHING! and the soothing 'Nobody's Home', one of the best and mature tracks in the album, featuring a deeper side of the album with help from Evanescence ex-guitarist Ben Moody. The video for this song is wonderful also.  <br /> <br />I am sure, if you dismiss Avril's past poseur image and pick up this CD and give it a proper, fair listen, you will find it quite good. I did.  <br /> <br /> <br />A+
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This movie is a great mixture of emotion and production. When I first started watching it, I thought, \\"How stupid\\". But I hung in there and found it to be one that I hated and loved at the same time.     It was stupid and clever, great and horrible, all wrapped up into one fantastic package.    I cried at the end and came away with a very refreshing feeling. My husband had recently passed away, and this movie spoke to me. Two Thumbs-Up.

B00003CWNR|5.0|I have to agree with all the reviewers who rated this film with 5 stars on all their points.    Simply put, this is a Two-Thumbs-Up classic worthy of ownership.

B000066NW0|4.0|i am a big fan of Avril Lavigne, but when I look back at old pictures of her I think to myself, 'what a poseur'. Its true, despite how many times other fans like me come to her defense whenever someone says she's a poseur, I agree with whoever that person was. She was stretching the rock chick image a bit too far. I'm not saying she claimed she was a punk, but I'm saying she was trying to be someone she couldn't. But she pulled it off incredibly in her second album (another story).  <br /> <br />But still, this album is wonderfull, all acoustic guitar-drums feel-ey easy pop punk. The whole album is basically a lot of fun, Avril teases and shouts a lot on this album, but it doesn't get annoying once, that is, accounting ONLY to the songs on this album. <br /> <br />I liked it, but its definitely not for intolerant people who already have a very bad image of Avril.  <br /> <br />B+
B0002858YS|5.0|dismiss the title for this review. Hysteria was a little over me. <br /> <br />ANYWAY <br /> <br />It is still true, The Killers does rock my socks off. This band from Las Vegas plays good music and has a good image also. I got hooked on to them first when I listened to their first single 'Somebody Told Me' which has pretty interesting lyrics, and feel good head boppers in it. I liked it a lot. <br /> <br />But their next single 'Mr. Brightside' had me crazy over the band. It was full of nostalgia and soothing tunes which mixed so well together that I had been hitting the repeat button over and over again. Okay, well, maybe not for so many times, but i DID press the repeat button.  <br /> <br />Another amazing track is 'Smile Like You Mean It'. The chorus is outstanding and I like how the band gives a very pseudo, mysterious and rock feel to all the songs. I enjoyed it on the whole.  <br /> <br />A.
0385474547|4.0|This book is about an African man, named Okonkwo, who lives in a village called Ummuofia. His village worships many gods and has many traditions. During the story Okonkwo comes across many prblems. During one celebration he accidentally kills a young boy and is exiled to his motherland for seven years. When he comes back he realizes that his village is being taken over and being influence by the white men. The white men cause many to convert to their religion and cause problems with the vilage. Eventually Ookonkwo cannot take it anymore and he tries to stop these men from destroying his village. <br /> <br />I think imperialism did hurt the Africans because it caused them to fall apart. The imperialists came to those tribes and destroyed them. When they came many people realized that their beliefs were false and they decided to conert to the Europeans religion. This caused a lot of bad blood between the tribe members which resulted in death or injury. <br /> <br />I gave this book four stars because it was interesting and exciting which i like in a book and it was also an easy read. But it only got four stars because the parts that were not interesting were just plain and boring. Also the ending with Okonkwo doing what he did was dumb in my opinion and it ruined the book in a way. I think the endng should be different. Also the names that were involved in the book were hard to remember and keep track of and they eventually caused the book to be really confusing.
B0007MVXQG|4.0|The first new album from Judas Priest since the Ripper Owens days and the first with Rob Halford since Painkiller (over ten years ago) tries to reclaim the ground it has \\"lent\\" to today's metal acts, with generally nice results.  From the first (the opener \\"Judas Rising\\"), the trademark Priest grinding guitars and hypnotic riffs light up the album, and generally keep a high level of energy throughout.  Rob Halford's voice is nothing less than fantastic; even his screams (at least on record) are still amazing, though his voice certainly stretches out with lower range and volume changes as well this time around, again with masterful results. <br />Two things that make \\"Angel Of Retribution\\" sound a bit different from what people see as the typical \\"Priest sound,\\" however, are the greater presence of the bass in songs and the nature of a few of the songs themselves.  First, Ian Hill's bass plays a much more central role in some songs (certainly on the album's first single, \\"Revolution\\", but on others like the finale \\"Lochness\\" as well), and helps to spread out the demands on screaming guitar solos (which I think are just a little toned down for this release) and Scott Travis' drums (but still a lot of the double bass drum beats throughout).  Hopefully this helps the band more easily capture the sound of these songs live and maybe even surpass them in their concert versions.  The second difference is that Priest (unlike many other bands of the genre) always have tweaked their sound a little to accomodate changes in their interests, and here is no different.  There's a full fledged ballad \\"Angel\\" which is not fair to simply refer to as a \\"power ballad,\\" as it deals with an interesting topic (asking for relief in the form of death at the end of the character's life) and is carried more by Halford's wonderful lower and mid range voice than the inevitable crashing guitar chorus.  \\"Eulogy\\" is another change of pace, kind of a view from outside the body of a group of mournerswith a heavy piano (maybe from Glenn Tipton?) base; mournful and an interesting segue into the album's last song, \\"Lochness,\\" an extended \\"trudge\\" through one of the more interesting myths of Scotland (Halford referred to it as their \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" moment). <br />There are still plenty of high-octane songs on the album to rock to (my favorites are \\"Deal With The Devil\\" and \\"Demonizer\\" with it's \\"Out, Demon, Out\\" line in the chorus) and even though the second half sags a bit in my opinion, the Priest machine has definitely retooled itself successfully for the forseeable future.  Recommended!
B000002JS6|5.0|It is what it is, rock in its purest form, hard driving guitars, completely over the top vocals, songs that exude energy and passion. BACK IN BLACK is AC/DC's masterpiece. No point in overanalyzing this one; it doesn't need it...just crank up the speakers and let the music take over. This one's purely about the joy of rock and roll. Nothing wrong with that.

B0007GAEW6|5.0|I am glad not all bands are this good, because if they were I would be broke from buying all the cd's. Rush should be proud of the musical monsters they helped create. I just wish that american radio and mtv would quit pushing that horrible processed crap they call music and start showing real musicians. This album is by far the best psychedelic album I have heard in quite a while. Anyone who disagrees should check out mtv, I'm sure they have music for people with low IQ's and bad taste.

0151008116|4.0|My favorite books are those that stay with you long after the reading. This book is one of them.<br /><br />The narrative itself is straightforward: Religiously promiscuous boy from India is shipwrecked on passage to Canada and finds himself the only survivor (or so it seems) on a lifeboat with a hyena, a lame zebra, an orangutan, and a Bengal tiger. Throughout the 200+ days on his \\"floating zoo\\" (or circus) Pi survives the inherent dangers through faith, determination, wit, and the tricks of the trade learned from his zookeeper father.<br /><br />Although not a religious book by any stretch, the reader is confronted with the deep spiritual wellsprings of the human condition.  In the end this book forces one to confront the questions of who we are and how we know.  Is Pi's story a concrete, scientific account or an allegorical story? While the book resists the provision of an ultimate answer (the facts could conceivably lead to either conclusion), the reader's journey with Pi suggests something about what it means to live as a religious person in an age of science and secularism.<br /><br />For one who takes his religion and theology straight, the book suffers somewhat for its incipient religious relativism.  A serious appreciation and love of religion demands that we attend to the particularities of a faith as much as to its commonalties with other faiths.  Pi's religious promiscuity is endearing and understandable in an adolescent, but Islam is not Hinduism and is not Christianity.  Love for God and love for godly people demands that we not impose a false uniformity upon spiritual visions that are inherently different. That the novel cannot grapple with this is a fairly minor flaw, but a flaw nonetheless.<br /><br />In the end, what we conclude about the life of Pi Patel probably says something more about us than it says about Pi.  That we must inhabit the narrative as interested players makes the work a richly rewarding experience.
B0007MVXQG|4.0|look up  the word. ..anyway i just bought this today -and i actually like it - it's is not the worst priest by far. some killer licks over basic lyrics but don't look for shakespeare in heavy metal dude. only one i had to laugh at was \\"lochness\\" - thoughts of spinal tap and \\"stone henge\\" came immediately to mind. but all in all good headbangin' fun- the live bonus video is great - saw them at ozzfest and they were super tight.
B00004XOWM|2.0|I like music with lots of swears, because when I listen to swears that makes me cool. My momma used to say, \\"Swears will make the devil have a party down under, and every time you say one he gains more power.\\" But I never listened to my momma so why start now? <br /> <br />Chocolate Starfish doesn't have enough swears. Fred Durst says the baddest of bad words about 100 times, but after it was over, I was left wanting more, darnit! More swears! Lots of swears! <br /> <br />In fact this idea of having \\"lyrics\\" in music is a bunch of hokey balogney. If it were up to me, only swears would be allowed in music. Loads of swears. So many that swears would flood the whole earth and we'd all start using swears on a random consistent basis. <br /> <br />Limp Bizkit is OK, but Fred Durst needs to use less words and more swears. <br /> <br />Oh wait what's that you say? Chocolate Starfish is just a bunch of swears with no lyrics? Fred Durst resorts to foul language in an effort to make himself sound tough and cool and rebellious? Well pick me up and throw me over a fence, I'm aghast! <br /> <br />Five stars for this then.
B000003JBM|3.0|...this album is worthwhile yes, BUT more as a historical document than in its own right. I say this in all honesty as a huge fan of Jazz, Gangstarr and Guru. I thought this album was okay at best, but have never loved it. <br /> <br />Let me explain: This album was indeed one of the early points where legit jazz (not samples) was being truly mixed in with hip hop. <br /> <br />Yet most early efforts eg Ronny Jordan's similar (but more instrumental) effort etc just lacked the right mix of these things. This album suffers from that weakness, despite the strength of the personell and the sincerety of intent by the participants. <br /> <br />If that isnt enough, this album (in my opinion) exposes and intersting fact: Guru perhaps in fact got props for his talent BEFORE it had actually flower.  Some of the lyrics here are not only corny but structurally weak.  <br /> <br />If you contrast by looking at Gurus work on the last 2 Gang Starr albums (The Ownerz, 2003) (Moment of Truth, 1998) the difference is shocking. There we see Guru as an MC in full bloom, total control of hs gift and throwing off hours of jaw-droppingly precise work. There his legendary status is more than confirmen. In fact if anything he puts forth a case for being greatest of all time there. <br /> <br />That puts anything he did here to shame as far as I'm concerned. In that sense my dissapointment at this album back when it came out is only confirmed: he could - and eventually DID - produce better than what he dropped here. <br /> <br />And musically, I will always think that Primo would be the one to truly bring the jazz & hip hop closer. What he does with samples is beyond incridbe. It is evidence of the kind of ear that would be required to put together a trully compelling mix of contemporary hip hop and live jazz. But for some reason, Primo has never seemed show any (public) evidenence of interest in exploring that. Maybe he doesn't want to step on Guru's toes. We may never now.... <br /> <br />But sure buy this Jazzamatazz thing to see what it was like, as a legit historical document of jazz and hip-hop starting to belnd. Just dont expect it to fulfill the hype it always seems to have got.
B00004Z459|2.0|I couldn't believe my ears listening to this CD!! Fred Durst is awesome!! He puts the rock back in \\"rox my sox!\\" And like he's Paris Hilton's boyfriend so that makes him automatically cool, because only the best go out with her!!! <br /> <br />Oh wait, what's that you say? Fred Durst didn't record this CD? Oh well then it sucks. 2 stars.
B0000CCZ34|5.0|This 2CD set is meant to be played from beginning to end without skipping any tracks. The Pet Shop Boys have an amazing sound that has not witherered with time. There are some slightly different versions of tracks in here (I Wouldn't Normally Do This Kind Of Thing, and Yesterday, When I Was Mad), but these versions are still great to hear. The third disc (available in the IMPORT 3cd version)  has some great mixes (best being New York City Boy - Lange Remix), but everything you need is in the first 2 discs, although, they should have included (Somewhere - Trouser Enthusiasts' Mix) -> a classic. <br /> <br />If you're a fan, pick it up. And yes, it does work when ripped into mp3s, I'm listening to them as I type.
B00005JNPZ|5.0|I went to see this with a friend of mine. When she first mentioned seeing this I tried to talk her into going to another movie because I had heard that the movie wasn't very good. Obviously we ended up going, only because there were no other movies out. I laughed through-out the movie so much that my stomach hurt. It has a great story line and many hilarious and unexpected scenes. The ending was perfect. I'm not one to see movies again, but I am planning on buying this and watching it at home. Great for all ages, and has little language. Definately worth seeing.
1881273628|5.0|The author says love is a choice. He says that the infatuation that people experience in the beginning of the relationship is not real love. It is something else. Real love takes work while the infatuation period is instinctual and effortless. But isn't it the stuff we dream of and wish would last forever? Can we really accept that we will only get that chance at the beginning of the relationship and that thereafter, in order to remain monogamous, we must accept that it is not for us to feel ever again? It explains a lot. But I accept his theory with the angst of a romantic.  <br /> <br />Yet anyone who is married and holds married life as a value that must be maintained must at some point consider the notion that making the marriage work after the honeymoon can be a matter of personal choice. And in so choosing, there are actions that communicate that willingness to different people psychologically. These are the five love languages that the author discusses: Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Giving Gifts, Acts of Service, Physical Touch. I will not go into any details of what is meant by each of these here. The titles are somewhat self-explanatory, with the exception of the last one, which does not necessarily refer to sex. The author explains each love language along with the concept that most people are chiefly responsive to just one. He also discusses how to determine your own as well as your spouse's, and even provides some optimistic advice on how to practice the love languages with an unreciprocating partner. Despite the author's Christian underpinnings, as a non-Christian, to me this did not detract from the relevance of the author's ideas.   <br /> <br />In fact, these \\"love languages\\" are not confined only to the marriage relationship, but may also serve to strengthen bonds with children - or perhaps any other person you need to communicate your love and support for. I especially found the chapter on children the most valuable because it not only expands the concept beyond the marriage relationship, but also drives home the point. We might have a choice as to whether we wish to stay married or not - but our children are ours forever.  <br /> <br />And this brings me back to the point about marriage. Far from being ready to claim mastery of the ultimate male-female partnership, I have reflected upon it a great deal. In an age where the divorce rate challenges the age-old institution upon which the family is built, one must ask how marriages were ever successful in the past. Some may point out that they really weren't, but that society simply forced two people to be miserable by making it taboo to separate. And this then begs the question, why would the world's varied cultures and divinely inspired religions condone this relationship again and again? In fact, I would venture to point out that for the vast measure of our recorded history marriage has not only been a standard, but has also been traditionally arranged! What ancient wisdom allowed such \\"life-sentences\\" to form such a firm foundation for the basic building block of society?  <br /> <br />I suspect the answer lies right here in this book. As hard as it may be to admit, the commonplace yearning for finding a new and exciting fling is quite likely an unfortunate addiction to a desire that in its very nature is meant to be only a temporary rush that pulls two people inexplicably together at the heart during their initial engagement. It is later, through maturity and insight into what makes the other person tick that we can choose to make each other perpetually happy and foster the bonds of enduring love. This book provides some valid insight into this process. It is light and easy reading that I think every couple should invest some time into, again and again.

Zep showed they could write, play, and innovate like none other, however the latter is often overlooked. In Houses, although parting from their style of earlier years slightly, Zep showed they could play a whole new genre and still amaze. Case in point \\"The Crunge\\" is an incredible song, yet it cannot be compared to any other Zep song. Houses simply proves that Zep can play any type of music and do so better than any other band. <br /> <br />So before you regale me with your rants of how Stairway is the best Zep song, understand that the best part of Zep is that they have such incredible range that they can have no best song. All in all, this album proves for all time that Zep isn't just the king, father, god, whatever you want of rock, they were so much more. Take your CD player off of repeat, take IV out, and try Houses, a shear pillar of musical genious and innovation.
0385474547|4.0|When I first picked up 'Things Fall Apart' by Chinua <br />Achebe I was very skeptical on whether I would like <br />it, as well as why on earth my teacher would make me <br />read it. A story about an African village did not seem <br />to fit into our curriculum, or interest me. <br />Nevertheless, I began to read it. At first the book <br />seemed very boring to me. Now that I've read the book <br />I know that you have to read the entire book to <br />comprehend the lesson it was trying to teach. Reading <br />the first 8 chapters and then giving up is a waste of <br />your time. Reading the whole book is reading time well <br />spent.  <br />    The book focuses mainly on the character Okonkwo <br />and his struggles. He feels guilty for his father's <br />laziness and vowes not to be like him. This does not <br />make him the most personable of people however. The <br />plot really only starts in the end. The beginning <br />chapters really all have different things happening. <br />This is really the only fault I found of the book. <br />Some say that the difficult names are a fault but they <br />aren't. The names make the book more authentic.  <br />    The book ties in with my school curriculum due to <br />the Ibo people's dealings with imperialism. I believe <br />imerialism had a devastating effect on the Ibo's. When <br />the white missionaries came to the villages, they <br />disrupted their whole wway of life. They disrespected <br />the faith and customs of the Ibo's, callin their God's <br />fake. Through their preaching, the missionaries got <br />many Ibo's to convert which caused anger between <br />members of the Ibo clan. The imperialists even caused <br />the main character, Okonkwo, to do something that is <br />very 'evil spirited'. Okonkwo had been strong to his <br />faith throughout the book but they forced him into <br />doing the unthinkable.  <br /> <br />'Things Fall Apart' while confusing at times is a <br />great read <br />
B0007O38F8|2.0|I listened to this whole album and there are maybe 3 songs on there that are any good. The worst song is by far Gatman and Robin ( with Eminem ). The best song is piggybank. The production is good ( that's why I gave it a gracious 2 stars ) but the lyrics are terrible. I thought it was just me until I let a couple of my friends listen to it also and they all agreed with me. I was looking forward to this CD for a very long time. When I finally heard it I was very dissapointed. 50 is trying to sing on just about every hook on his songs ( isn't that one of the reasons why he dissed Ja Rule ) and he does not sound that great. If you are going to buy this and think it is anything like Get Rich or Die Trying, you will be dissapointed greatly.......Save your money!!!!!
B00028HBKM|5.0|If someones asks you what is a movie,or a film,I guess the right answer would be that it's a continuing view of images which appear incredibly fast,thus creating us the illusion of moving pictures.Films are supposed to entertain us,and sometimes even give us a message. <br />''THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST'' does all that(entertaiment is not only having fun,but also getting in touch with your feelings)-but not only that. <br />In this film we watch the last hours of Jesu's mortal life.This incudes aucorse a lot of blood and a lot of whips.Many people said that the film shows those scenes just to impress.Others say that they are over the edge-meaning Jesus wasn't beaten that much.And some others even think that there is no historical proof that Christ existed(you don't need proof to believe,but anyway).Now,I could spend two hours on my computer writing why they are wrong,but unfortuently this is a movie review so I am not allowed.All I can say to them is this:You are mistaken.For the ''over the edge scenes'',and ''Jesu's existense'' you will have to read some books,but for the ''violent scenes just to impress'' I can explain.The film is not about that.The film shows you the innoscense of Jesus,like a simple man,and like a Messiah.Then we are shown the people's reaction on His innoscense,His love to the same people that beat Him,while they beat Him. <br />An alternate title for this movie could never be ''How to beat up Jesus'',but it sure could be ''What did our sins done to Him''.This film is not about violence,this movie is about love.I saw this film,and when it ended,I felt like I saw the most innoscent film on the planet. <br />I suggest you watch this masterpiece.If you are good-hearted,open-minded,and read some books,this movie could change your life.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|'Frances The Mute' immediately lays all doubts to rest, that yes, it's possible that the Mars Volta could exceed the grandiosity and pretentiousness of 'Deloused in the Comatorium'. Running at over 80 minutes, there's no denying the sheer ambition of music's most hypersonic duos, Cedric Bixler and Omar Rodriguez. This CD builds upon the template of their debut, and takes it a step further; just more of everything, more blistering guitar solos, more musical scope/experimentation, and generally more monumental. Once again, Cedric's wails and the fierce Page-Karoli-Santana guitar solos of Omar Rodriguez, dominate the album. Certainly Jon Theodore's frenetic Mitch Mitchell-esque drumming style should not be overlooked as well. The 'prog-rock meets classic rock' comparisons have been beaten into the ground, but in fact that would be accurate, going from moody Pink Floyd/Hawkwind sections to self-aggrandizing solos that would make Jimmy Page and Carlos Santana proud. Thrown into the mix are some avant-garde twists, 'Via l'Viaquez' has it's flamenco moments, the 30 minute magnum opus 'Cassandra Geminni' is sprinkled with Ornette Coleman sax-flurrys. It almost seems like the Mars Volta has been blessed with musical speaking-in-tongues, capturing the spirit of a different age unleashed as a musical mosaic, and the most impressive thing is that it works. 'Frances The Mute' is an astonishing album, breathtaking musicanship, progressive in it's spirit, and majestic in it's ambition. Definitley one of the strongest CD's of 2005.
0783225792|5.0|I love his movie more than any other. All that I want is commentary. Will it ever happen??? Please Warner, Please Mr. Scorcese!!!
B0007GAEW6|5.0|First off, I can completely understand how people will be dissappointed by this release. What I found so interesting about Mars Volta on De-Loused...was they could make prog rock while maintaining a unique sense of catchiness to each song. Well...this is not the the case AT ALL for Frances The Mute. There are 3 songs that are 12 minutes in length and a mammoth 32 minute finale.<br /><br />Cedric Bexler the eccentric frontman for The Volta still maintains and carries over his emotion from De Loused. What I found intriguing was the spanish lyrics blended in with English. Its done in a way not to get anyone extremely lost in this already complex album. Its unbelievable to say but the lyrics are a little more comprehensible this time around though light years from others.<br /><br />Musically this album reminds me so much of Led Zeppelin's concert turned film album The Song Remains The Same. In which, there are 25 minute versions of songs that were about six minutes long with ambient sounds and long waits. The same can applies here to Mars Volta. There are songs that without these sounds would easily be about 5 - 7 minutes. However I don't see this as a weakness but as a way to really bring out the climatic sections. In the vein of a novel that might drag on a few pages and you feel you're about to give in and BOOM! your capitivated by whatever happened.<br /><br />With a song that is climbing up the Billboard Rock Charts, the next few weeks will be very interesting for this band considering those people only familar with The Widow will be shocked at *gasp* songs longer than three minutes and thirty seconds. This quote about Meshuggah for \\"I\\", I find can also describe \\"Frances The Mute\\", Still, some may not find it to be enough bang for their buck or have enough patience to handle such a mammoth undertaking of attention-demanding artistic rock. But then again, those that fickle don't deserve to listen to a band as talented as Mars Volta anyway.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|This album is great for all Defenders!!  It has all the material make fans of all eras happy!!  What can I say, I'm Speecless, buy this album and give metal a good kick in the A## in America again.
0385512058|5.0|In the interest of transparency, I'll start this review by saying that I did used to work for Keith. That being said, that was many years ago when he gave an untested 19 year old from Columbia a chance to intern at a place like Deloitte.  Having said that, know that I have not spoken to Keith in years, and by no means would jump on this board editorializing or reviewing something that I did not feel strongly about.  I have gone on to a very successful career in sales entirely on my own (as have many people who have worked for or with Keith Ferrazzi), but I can tell you without a doubt that I learned and earned more from working WITH Keith than having him actually open doors for me. <br /> <br />I challenge anyone, anywhwere to find a better networker than Keith. Simply put, the guy was born with a business card in his hand. Yet he is far, far different from the swarmy gladhanders you bump into at the standard \\"networking event\\". Keith loves people, loves to help people, and loves to learn from people - and this is the core of his business philosophy. <br /> <br />There is nothing revolutionary in this book - you will not find the Davinci Code solved in the epilogue, learn the secrets of inner peace from the Kaballah, or figure out why you didn't get that job you interviewed for last week. What you WILL get is a step-by-step primer on the REAL importance of networking and human capital - not the BS you get from a job site or a chamber of commerce.  I now work as Corporate Recruiter for one of the largest executive search firms in the world - Keith's quotes on the preventative nature of networking, i.e. having the correct contacts in place in case something goes wrong in your career as opposed to trying to make those connections afterward - is something EVERYBODY should heed. If everybody read this book, my profession would be in serious jeapordy. <br /> <br />This is just one of the many kernels of wisdom that you can take form this book. Dinner party tips, guerillaconvention strategies, phone and email techniques - everybody stands to learn something form this book that they did not know before or that they knew and had forgotten the importance of. And in case you were wondering - yes, Keith actually does all of this stuff; this is not some pompous, cliche' throwing \\"business guru\\" pontificating on something that he studied extensively during his tenure at Harvard Business School. He has ten thousand people in his PalmPilot and will still return your email in ten minutes. <br /> <br />Whether they are Partners at a consulting firm or telemarketers selling timeshares, if you have a sales staff, have them read this book. I personally bought copies for all my staff and am looking forward to the day when I can be considered an \\"anchor tenant\\". Even if you are not in sales  -keep in mind that in any career you will end up having to sell yourself and your ideas at one point, and this book will help you do that. Buy it. <br /> <br />
0440237688|4.0|Pulling you right in looking for answers, the author of The Giver, Lois Lowry, knows just how to grab attention. <br /> <br />Jonas, the main character, is a 12 year old boy who represents the rebellious youth in our communities. He provokes change throughout the story and challenges the way of life. <br /> <br />\\"Jonas, Jonas, Jonas.\\" The chant comes alive as we learn that he will be the next Receiver of Memory. This appointment requires him to enter the room of the Giver. Here is where the adventure commences. <br /> <br />Training to take over for the Giver, Jonas learns what everyone has forgotten. Truths are revealed, memories set free, and morals put to the test. Should Jonas leave life as it is or make the decision to change it for everyone?  <br /> <br />Lowry closes with much to interpret. Stated as her reason for this, \\" People bring to it their own complicated beliefs . . . So, I don't want to put my own feelings into it, my own beliefs, and ruin that for people who create their own endings in their minds.\\" <br /> <br />    <br /> <br />
B0007NFL18|1.0|I will admit to you right now, that I have not heard all of the songs on this album, but I have heard enough of his previous work to know what he is all about.  I also admit that most of his songs are catchy, but you can thank Dre for that.  There are so many things wrong with 50.  First, he is partly responsible for the death of a rap legend, whom helped mentor him.  Second, he looks at his music as a way to make money, nothing more.  He could stand to learn a lot from Kanye, who is going to change the face of hip hop, possibly music.  I have heard most of Late Registration, and when it drops, 50 won't even matter.  Another thing, if it weren't for Em, 50 wouldn't even be as popular as he is.  You would think that we would learn from Pac that promoting violence only leads to trouble, but I guess 50 is Ready to Die.  I recently read a lot of news about 50 that is more proof of his ignorance.  He has begun dissing almost anyone he can, many of which do not deserve it.  I am not saying that Fat Joe is the best rapper, but he didn't start beef with 50.  As for his beef with Nas, if I was 50, I wouldn't start start nothing with someone who could write circles around me.  50 even got mad at The Game for not hating on Nas and others, and now he is out of G-Unit.  It is a true shame that someone who stood for something (Pac) had to die, even though he did promote violence.  50 should rethink his message, or else someone might decide to end his career, possibly his life.  I am not saying I want that, but when people like Kanye, Telib, Luda, and Nas are out there, why even bother listening to 50's pop music?
B000063DIH|5.0|this is one of the best Iron Maiden cds i own at the moment. From Here to Eternity is an amazing song that makes you wanna like go straight to hell and shake Eddies hand. Be Quick or be Dead is a classic song and i also highly recommend hearing it live. The Apparation is a great song with interesting lyrics and this crazy guitar solo in the middle. and of course Fear of the Dark is one of the best songs ever in the whole world. without a doubt. SO GO BUY IT NOW!!!! UP THE IRONS!!!!!!! <br />                                    -----thompson
B0007TKH66|1.0|What an incredibly awful & boring piece of TV. This show lacks the charisma of Trek and its ideals. The cast is terrible, most especially the Vulcan woman with enlarged er... ears. It has been repeated many times that Trek fans will buy anything as long as it has Trek written on. After this show, I believe it. I anxiously purchased the special editions of all the films, TOS, TNG, DS9 and Voyager. I will not be buying this trash! No wonder it was cancelled!
B00008J2PG|4.0|This movie, albeit long, does a lot to help people question the popularly held view that the Catholic Church sat out the war and did nothing to help Jews in danger. Certainly, Msgr. O'Flaherty is a Righteous Gentile in all senses of the word 'righteous'. Regarding Pius XII, the scurrilous accusations against him seem to stem from a stageplay from the early 1960's. How an accusation from an piece of fiction can become 'gospel truth', so to speak, is no surprise. Look what it did for Catherine the Great--whoa, boy! As to Mr. Peck's accent, I find it amusing that he is criticized in other reviews. Amused, because Gregory Peck's parents were Irish-born folk who emigrated to America, settling in southern California. He grew up with Irish accents all around him. His is a soft brogue. Maybe what people are expecting is that overdone 'wee' leprechaun schtick that usually passes for an Irish accent.
B00000JCB2|1.0|Limp Bizkit...Pioneers in the Death Metal Arena. \\"Significant Other\\" marks the return of their speeding thrashy riffs and blistering extended guitar solos. The double kick drums are a metal tour de force while Fred's raspy growls and lung fired screams embody the very essence of metals true nature. With the bands current line-up they are sure to tour with Metal vets such as the ever vigilant Whitesnake , the blood drenched raw power of Hootie and the Blowfish, and of course metal greatest vocalist and master of orignality Kid Rock. Had Limp Bizkit kept their repetitive beats, Rap-influenced whiney vocals and slow uninspired drums this album may have sucked. The hint of sarcasm in this reveiwers tone can only be summed up as...Priceless.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Frances the Mute is the sophomore album by the Mars Volta; featuring an array of musicians that would make the best symphonies  look at them in awe. Every element of this cd is perfect and quite difficult to find a flaw in at all, beautifuly recorded and wonderfully produced by Omar A. Rodriguez-Lopez who is also the bands guitarist. This album is a magnificent work of art that should be listened to on head phones for what will probably be the best listening experience of your life; without a doubt it will be the best album released this year by any artists out there. And when it all comes down to it the best advise i could give anyone is...throw all expectations aside, sit down and listen to it from beginning to end and if you have an open mind and open ears then you wont be disappointed.
B0002X314C|4.0|Don't get me wrong, there are some great tracks on this CD, but people are hyping John Legend as the next big thing. Honestly, though, he's mostly going to end up a critics' darling since he makes pretty great remanufactured soul. He has an amazing voice. It's good listening for the most part, but it won't change your life. It's too much like so many others (Angie Stone, etc...), it feels too much like a nod to the past rather than an original and new sound. Buy it, but know that you may have to skip a few tracks during playback.  <br /> <br />
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is a total masterpiece, it's not an album that you'll digest quickly the first time you listen to it, that is because it has so many special details that even after listening to it for weeks on your car, there will be always something new you'll be delighted with. Thom Yorke's voice, excellent voice, Jonny Greenwood's performance on the guitar and its special effects, keyboards, etc... are just things that you all people and I mean ALL people haven't heard before. I can consider it the best album I've ever heard. It's been 8 years since its release and still its songs are something so unique and so BIG. Thank you Radiohead!
B0007NFL18|3.0|I got a bootleg of this album a week ago, I have spun it in my CD Player over 10 times. I listened carefully to each track. He simply can't expand his horizon to incorporate some lyrics that connect to the fans. He is not frontin'. He raps about the following: being a cold hearted thug, popping them things and getting money. Wow, how many more millions can he make before you realize he is fake? He had skill, he did one album, but you cant change the beats and use the same lyrics for another album. Man, it pisses me off how naive people are to keep buying this stuff. It is not artisitc at all. <br />Buy it, enjoy it, and pop ur gats all you e-thugs! <br />Ya herd.
B0002858YS|5.0|This is an awesome album; from start to finish it grabs you and keeps hold. Many compare The Killers to new wave bands of yore, however they have there own distinct sound. I think the mixture of synth with pop and rock is excellent and hopefully this is just one of many gems to come for this band. <br /> <br />
B0002YLC24|2.0|What if?  Well we'll never know.  I anxiously awaited the sequel.  But I was so disappointed.  Before Sunset has an unnatural cut-off ending.   <br />The main characters have so much chemistry together, but the viewer is utterly cheated out of so much has Jesse's hand in Celine's hair, or even a kiss.  Not one kiss.  Oh brother.  Superb acting, superb setting, sublime love story... horrible horrible cliffhanger ending.  And not even a kiss or love scene.  At least in Before Sunrise we had the scene in the park to hang onto.   <br />The acting was better, Jesse was more likeable, Celine a bit less annoying and cloying, but overall the ending ruined the movie leaving it just as up in the air as the first.
0451204530|1.0|Readers hoping for a story comparable to Follett's \\"Eye of the Needle\\" will be sadly disappointed by this limp effort.  We have the standard impeccably upright and ultra-handsome hero, standard establishment villain (guess which one is named \\"Luke\\" and which \\"Anthony\\"), standard gorgeous women good and bad, standard sex scenes (so important to an actioner), standard totally implausible plot with unlikely coincidences, etc.  To create a sense of portent or urgency the author resorts to the silly practice of interjecting \\"missile facts\\" every few pages.  A frequent plot cop-out is that whenever the bad guy (a \\"trained agent\\") gets the drop on a good guy, the latter pushes him or trips him or punches him or something to upset the applecart.  This happens so predictably that by the final, even less credible scene you expect it. <br /> <br />The only good thing I can say about this book is that it is probably - though not certainly - better than I could write.  That's a miserably low standard for an author of Follett's talent.  Don't waste your time on it.
B0002I831S|5.0|Once you get beyond all of the junk associated with Star Trek, the \\"trekkie\\" stuff of dressing like Spock on weekends, or learning to speak Klingon, and just watch the show..you see why Trek has such a strong following almost four decades after it's initial broadcast. \\"Star Trek\\" really was ahead of it's time. This show took the Science Fiction genre to a whole new level in much the same way \\"Gunsmoke\\" took the western genre from \\"The Lone Ranger\\" to serious adult drama. The shows presented in this first season box set are some of the best dramatic TV from the time, science fiction or otherwise. Just watch \\"Menagerie\\" or \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\", both feature top notch writing and storylines, well above your standard weekly series fare, even by today's standards. Sure there are some clunker episodes in this set, \\"The Alternative Factor\\", and sure you may chuckle at the special effects in epsiodes like \\"Arena\\" or \\"Operation--Annihilate\\", but that is what makes \\"Star Trek\\" really great. It's a product of it's time, so even though the special effects aren't that special, the writing and acting more than make up for it. When you first watch the \\"Devil in the Dark\\" you might get a chuckle out of Spock communicating with what looks like a giant shag-carpet-scab....but Nimoy is just such a good actor, and the story is so compelling, you look beyond the lousy creature costume and just get sucked into the story. If you are like me, and remember catching the odd repeat here or there growing up, do yourself a favor and pick this up. The shows are all really good, and you can enjoy them even if you have never owned a pair of Spock ears.
1400032717|4.0|I would have given this book 5 stars but I felt that the story line could have been a bit more connected. I would also have liked it if the characters of the mother and the father were a bit more three dimensional. Over all it was an interesting and compelling look into the mind of the autistic child.
B0006M4SO6|4.0|While browsing through Virgin's MS Jazz section, I heard this CD. My first though was that it was a collection of unreleased selections from a Jazz comp. I was pleasantly surprised that it was The Metheny Group. This CD did what it was suppose to do (bring out different feelings and emotions). It's a 68-minute wave of Metheny, Mays and Sanchez flowism. It gives the listener the sense of being somewhere kicking back experiencing this live (which a good jazz project is suppose to do). While it's not what most would call a \\"masterpiece\\" it is a pinnacle-piece...simple enough for the rookie jazz fan and complex enough to satisfy the hardcore jazz enthusiast. I picked this up right away and have not stopped listening to it since. Every time I load this up on my Mp3 I hear things I didn't hear before... <br /> <br />For those who gave this CD a bland review, take another listen. Remember, not to long ago another project along this venue was released with not favorable reviews...today \\"A Love Supreme\\" is a Coltrane classic! <br />
B0000YEEGM|5.0|What can I say, you have to see this movie to judge for yourself. Raymond, one of the main characters is autistic-savant. It's a movie about love between two brothers, one is much younger and very successful in life (Charlie Babbitt, played by Tom Cruise) and the other is the autistic older brother (Raymond Babbitt, played by Dustin Hoffman, he got an acadamy award for this one), who is institutionalized. This movie makes me think every time I see it, it's one of those movies that you can watch more than once, rent it and experience the world you may not know exists.<br /><br />Get the Special Edition DVD, if you're wanting to buy this film. The DVD only has three commentaries, one deleted scene and a featurette. Also a few trailers and photo gallery, but MGM could have done much better. For a special edition re-release it still kind of sucks. Nevertheless, you're supposed to enjoy the film.<br /><br />This is a masterpiece of a film, and it should NOT be missed. Rent it, buy it, experience it.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Few artists have the skill to push the boundary.  \\"De-loused in the Comatorium,\\" the previous studio album by The Mars Volta did just that.  Almost no artist has created a new boundary.  The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Tool and Radiohead created something new and amazing that if you don't like the artist, you at least have respect for what they have created.  Now with \\"Frances the Mute,\\" The Mars Volta have entered an unknown region of the music world.  The tempo ranges from slow to fast and in between, mixed with pulsating drumms, fierce solos from the guitar, bass, and even trumpets.  The genres of music, progressive-psychedelic classic rock fused with Latin and salsa clash together to form an experience on the ears like none before.  <br />      <br />The amount of instruments on the album add greatly, from the violin, the cello, to the piano, and more.  Cedric Bixler Zavala mixes English and Spanish vocals with his distinctive voice.  This band is refining their craft, it took Pink Floyd six albums before they became the band people remember today.  This is only The Mars Volta's third studio effort (including their EP \\"The Tremulent\\").  There are times during this album when Pink Floyd would be jealous.  What the future holds for this band no one knows, I don't know if we can even begin to perceive what else they could come up with.  I thought \\"De-loused in the Comatorium\\" was special and pushed the boundary, but it can't even hold its own against the multi-dimensional effort of \\"Frances the Mute.\\"  Don't listen to me, listen to the album.
B0006B2A2E|4.0|What an excellent, excellent movie. Jim Carrey (Joel) dominates the screen in probably his best serious role yet. Basically, he meets a girl, and they fall in love. Well, trouble brews between them, and the girl, Clementine, decides to erase all memory of Joel. Finding out about this, Joel decides to go through with the procedure himself. Halfway through Joel fights desperately to keep his memories of Clementine alive because he doesn't want to forget her. The best part of the movie is inside Joels mind as he tries to hold on to the memories he has left. Cinematography plays a HUGE role in effectively showing Joels mind, and in the beginning it seems kind of creepy as everything is kind of shadowy and dark. It is a great way to symbolize our thinking onto the big screen. During the end, the plot goes a little awry, but eventually fits into the end story. I believe the weakest moments of this film are when the movie goes to the scenes that focus on the people performing the memory erasure. Elijah Wood is also in the movie, which kind of ruined it for me because i still see him as Frodo from the Lord of the Rings. I feel that movies have more of a realistic quality when the actors are people I don't know. Sure Jim Carrey is someone I know, but he plays the part so well that he doesn't ruin the movie. So because of these small flaws i listed, Eternal Sunshine gets a 4 out of 5. It is definately a great movie to watch, and is quite moving at some points. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do so when it comes out to rent, or to buy. A fantastic movie all around that really makes you think at parts.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|Where do i beging? Man this movie is the best movie ive seen so far. its scary, its thrilling, its funny, its just plain awesome. Now for does who have read that this movie is kinda like \\"seven\\" let me explain. The only reason people are compering this movie to seven is the fact that the killer in this one whants to teach a sick moral lesson. Thats the ONLY thing these movies have in comen !!!!!!
B0000B1OFL|5.0|What a terrific movie! \\"The Italian Job\\" was one of the best movies of the summer of 2003. There has not been a re-make like this one in years! This film is blessed with a brilliant script, solid cast of skilled actors (Seth Green was hilarious), breathtaking scenery and fabulous, realistic stunts. The pace is perfect - it moves slow enough to keep you following the story, but fast enough to make it interesting. The story is crafted in a way to make it completely believable, but still leaves you scratching your head thinking \\"How is that POSSIBLE?\\" To anyone looking for a nice change from the mundane, often brainless movies released, \\"The Italian Job\\" will get the job done.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|\\"Tremulant\\" and \\"Deloused in the Comatorium\\" are two discs that showcase music at its un-categorizable finest. The Mars Volta made it hard to put them into a single genre of music and you could just describe it as rock/latin/experimental/etc... musical art. The Mars Volta try too hard to create their brand of art on \\"Francis the Mute\\" and give a much less interesting and focused album, compared to their previous work. An example to back this claim up would be the minutes spent listening to ambient sounds (and there are a lot). In \\"Deloused\\", these noises would bring a nice lead in for a crescendo leading into the rest of the song, but are mostly annoying in \\"Frances\\". Cedric's vocals are still lightening though as he seamlessly goes from English to Spanish...which would be a lot better if I knew any Spanish. Track breakdown: <br /> <br />1) \\"Cygnus...Vusmund Cygnus\\" - A good song overall and is what you would gladly expect from TMV. 4/5 <br /> <br />2) \\"The Widow\\" - A slower song, but Cedric's vocals make it as good as it is. 4/5 <br /> <br />3) \\"L'Via L'Viaquez\\" - Probably the best song on the album. Mixes some wonderful straight up rock with Latin grooves. 5/5 <br /> <br />4) \\"Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore\\" - A complete waste of time and talent in my opinion. 13 minutes long and only two are semi-worth listening to. 0/5 <br /> <br />5) \\"Cassandra Geminni\\" - This song is about 25 minutes long and at times is good and at times just gets boring and/or repetitive. Overall it's decent. 3/5 as a whole, but is better when you listen to it part by part <br /> <br />6) \\"Frances the Mute\\" - Not listed on the CD, this is only 5 minutes long (you know its TMV when 5 minutes is referred to as ONLY). It's a good ender to a pretty good disc that just gets lost in itself. 3/5 <br /> <br />To conclude, after two great albums, expectations were unreasonably high and \\"Frances the Mute\\" is just under the bar they set for themselves.
B000063DIR|1.0|As was done with Ozzy's brilliant Blizzard of Oz, this \\"remaster\\" was altered in a significant way: the label removed the original bass and drums and substituted newly-recorded tracks in their place. There is no way to know this looking at the outside of the cd, one has to read the buried, \\"new\\" Blizzard lineup in the liner notes, also know that Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslak were original members of Blizzard, and then figure it out by seeing two other guys besides them playing bass and drums. Pretty sneaky! It would be like buying the White Album and learning that Paul and Ringo's parts were replaced in 2002 by the two guys who play them on Beatlemania. A total ripoff.
1401300901|5.0|My husband was killed in an accident when I was 32 years old, and reading this book was like reading my own journal...the thoughts and emotions that the character has, and the things that she goes through are amazingly true-to-life.  I could not believe that the author had not gone through a similiar experience herself.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book, if not only for the things-can-work-out-in-the-end-feel-good entertainment value alone, but for a glimpse into what it is truely like to lose your husband at such a young age - something I hope you will never have to go through first hand.
B0000029AP|5.0|Aside from the most starry-eyed fans, I think most Aerosmith fans will admit that the group has at times suffered artistically since their commercial comeback in the latter half of the '80s with their sappy/ overblown power ballads, not to mention the annoying show biz schmaltz Steven Tyler has tended to indulge in.  However, if all that has lead you to forget what a superb band Aerosmith was at one time, a good listen to 1975's \\"Toys In The Attic\\" will refresh your memory.  If you're looking for ultra-catchy, exciting, loud rock & roll, you've hit the jackpot with this album.  They make a direct nod to their blues influences with the short, jazzed-up cover tune \\"Big Ten Inch Record\\" which is a fun change of pace.  Apart from that track, everything is either written or co-written by Tyler, and nearly every track is a gem.  Tyler's patented screeching vocals are on full display on \\"Toys...\\", yet they have a certain grittiness and honesty that largely seemed to get lost as the years went by.  The hits \\"Walk This Way\\" and the talk box-infested, excellently harmonized \\"Sweet Emotion\\", co-written by Joe Perry and Tom Hamilton respectively, are both riff-crazy funk rockers that are a total blast.  \\"Uncle Salty\\" is sort of a ballad with terrific ringing guitar hooks plus some great harmonies--the fade is a bit overlong, but otherwise it's a great track.  Tyler's lone solo composition, the ultra sly, cleverly arranged \\"Adam's Apple\\", is an absolute hook-fest.  The ominous \\"Round And Round\\", co-written by Brad Whitford, is a pounding, cathartic track.  The album closer \\"You See Me Crying\\" is a soaring orchestrated rock ballad, one of their best ballads ever.  I haven't even mentioned the title track yet which starts the album off with an exciting, fast-paced blast.  The acoustic guitar laden \\"No More No More\\" does have a 'we needed one more song for the album' kind of feel to it--it's not as great as most of the album, but it's still a solid, enjoyable rock song.  If Aerosmith's music from the '80s and later has you confused as to how anyone could possibly proclaim them as the greatest rock & roll band in America, proceeding directly to \\"Toys In The Attic\\" will make that claim a heck of a lot easier to understand--this is a superb, must-have album.

B0001I55SS|2.0|I like the premise of this film, some of the vast gothic settings, the mad scientist plot device, and the idea that black holes are passageways to heaven and hell is quite amusing. But I rate this film low for several reasons. (1) I cannot forgive the fact that in virtually every scene where a human is floating about in zero gravity, or where a robot is cruising through the air, the black piano wires supporting him/her/it are totally visible. This film was made in 1979. More than ten years earlier (1968), 2001: A Space Odyssey had multiple scenes of weightlessness that were visually flawless and totally convincing. (2) Although some of the special effects are creatively rendered, many are extremely dated, even for that era. (3) The acting is not just wooden, it's petrified. (4) The dialogue is laughable. (5)The science is absurd. (6) The blood-red Maximilian robot always seems nothing more than a dangling shell with a red light inside. (7) V.I.N.CENT and B.O.B. are way too cutesy. Overall, the negatives far outweigh the positives.
B0006SSOHC|1.0|Lame. This movie debuts at #1 on the 2004 Craplist. It tries to much to be like \\"Seven\\" and \\"The Usual Suspects\\" and falls short of even effectively duplicating the plot twists and surprises of those two films. I wanted both my time and money back. I would escape by sawing MY leg off if I was chained to a floor in a dank room and forced to watch this movie over and over again.  And if you didn't pick up on what was going to happen in the first five minutes, like what the title meant, then you're an idiot who provides a market for brainless films with bad acting and sensationalized plots and idiotic violence. I'm sorry, but this movie SUCKED!
B000056HE9|5.0|Get it, Get it, Get it. <br /> <br />Now that we've gone past the subtleties, this is indeed one of the better feel good oldies and definitely one of the best Cary Grant shows. <br /> <br />Amazingly, even though made in 1948, it is still soooo.. relevant today. The issues raised and the sentiments felt are still so real and alive even today. <br /> <br />The best part is that for an old show it is amazingly accepting and non-preachy about a lot of things. There is also sufficient twists and turns in the plot to rise above the genre of innocent and simplistic films from the past. <br /> <br />Love it. It is still excellent and will definitely more than hold its own with the best shows of today.
043942593X|4.0|Alex is an average thirteen year old English boy. He lives a simple life with his uncle in large apartment. Until one day he gets the news that transforms his life. \\"Your uncle has been killed in a car crash\\". Alex is not exactly devastated by this tragic news. However he has much anticipation and curiosity about what life is about to offer him. After some exploration into the matter he finds out that he is to become a secret agent.  <br />  Stormbreaker by Anthony Horowitz is an excellent book. By combining mystery, adventure, and special little twists with a European originality that gives the story a persistently stimulating. The book traces Alex adventures of following in the footsteps of his late uncle trying to solve a mystery. He comes  perilously close to being discovered and unmasking himself from his false identity. The reader becomes engrossed in the story, dragged through training camps ,and taken on special missions in pursuit of the mystery of the storm breaker. Of course the latest in secret agent software is imaginatively woven into his adventure.   <br /> This science fiction story interconnects the life and troubles of a teenage boy. Clearly it is a story of maturation though not necessarily Alex`s maturation. Certain characters have only minor roles in the book included only in one chapter similarly to life. One such character is a man named Wolf who learns not to judge by appearances. He also learns the importance of expressing feelings through his own emotional growth.  <br /> Many themes are presented in story which are relevant to real life. But  the main theme is \\"Always persevere...\\" Alex clearly demonstrates this by persistence that eventually leads to the salvation not only of himself but of all England from destruction caused by a deadly virus. <br />  As a teenager myself it is easy for me to relate to Alex. When Alex finally finds the key to all his findings he chooses not to consult the grownups in charge of his unit and instead takesupon himself to do all the work. I to have the problem of often trying to take \\"missions\\" upon myself without consulting an adult. This big-headedness proved in the end though to be a desirable K-UNIT property and Alex prevailed over the enemy. <br />
B000002KIE|5.0|There are certain moments in music (rock-n-roll) history that can only be fully appreciated if you were there when they happened.  This album is one of them.  There are others that, although \\"real fans\\" may be consider the anti-Pistols, were equally as influential on the musical (rock-n-roll) world.  Some of those are easier to appreciate now than others.  With the Beatles, Sgt. Peppers, Trout Mask Replica, Led Zepplin I, Highway 51, Velvet Underground with Nico, Are You Experienced?, Dark Side of the Moon, well you get the picture.  These are albums that influenced literally thousands of musicians who in turn shaped the landscape of the music (rock-n-roll) of our time and for many, your parents' time.  Whether or not you like these musical (rock-n-roll) moments in time, you must acknowledge and appreciate their places in history.  Bollocks is one of those moments.  They don't come around that often.  Bollocks was the synergy that evolved into the grunge sound of Kurt Cobian and Green Day.  It was the sound of London in the late 70's.  There are songs of social commentary on the hypocrisy of England's throne (God Save the Queen), a call for changes and rebellion against the then current political system (Anarchy in the UK), anti-abortion (Bodies), and even sympathy and disgust for government run amok (Holidays in the Sun).  In hindsight, with the exception of some historical rap album of which I am not aware, Bollocks may be the last really influential album since 1976.  Buy it.  Learn it.  Live it!
B0006Z2LH4|4.0|Okay, first of all I don't need to tell you that this prequel isn't as good as the original. You should know that, even if you haven't seen it. That point has been over-said enough. But what I can tell you is that Cube Zero offers a much needed breath of fresh in air in the Cube series.<br /><br />After Cube 2: Hypercube, I have to admit that I was alittle skeptical in renting Cube Zero. I guess I was just afraid of another rehashed version of the first one. Cube 2 just had upgraded special effects and really nothing interesting or new to add to the idea. Cube Zero succeeds in everything Cube 2 failed at.<br /><br />Cube Zero offers a really interesting storyline that takes you outside the Cube (but not too far) and into the minds of two technicians that watch and monitor people inside the cube. After so long, one of them is eaten up by the guilt and all the unanswerable questions surrounding the cube, and decides to venture inside the cube himself to try and help out the surviving people inside.<br /><br />What I liked about the story to Cube Zero was that it gaves us some much needed answers surrounding its purpose and where it came from, but does it in such a way that it doesn't take away from any of the mystery or eeriness that the original film did for it. Even after everything that Cube Zero explains, I can still watch Cube and be just as satisified with it. Cube Zero ruins nothing that the original film did. Plus, the ending to the film is just great, as it explains something from the first film that intrigued me for so many years.<br /><br />In addition to all that, if your a gore fan Cube Zero is probably the goriest Cube film, and its death sequences with the traps are just spectacular and original. And the acting is plausible.<br /><br />In ending, Cube Zero is definitely worth seeing for any Cube fan that was disappointed with Cube 2.

B0002OERI0|5.0|If Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" can be said to be the ultimate rock expression of personal alienation and psychological displacement, Green Day's \\"American Idiot\\" is the best contender yet for ultimate rock expression of cultural alienation and psychosocial displacement. <br /> <br />I have been a largely indifferent Green Day listener, enjoying their music when I heard it at parties or on the radio since they first started out (during my college years), but not finding myself moved enough to actually purchase their records. That very much changed with this album. As soon as I heard the title track, shortly before the disastrous 2004 presidential election, I knew this was a different music than I'd heard before. On hearing the full album, I knew I was right. Diverse, interesting, rich, incisively written, \\"American Idiot\\" represents the fulfillment of Generation X: no longer youth adrift but mature, participatory members of a society from which they are yet continuing to be alienated. <br /> <br />Ranging from the merely enjoyable (\\"Whatsername,\\" \\"Letterbomb\\") to the excellent (\\"American Idiot,\\" \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\") to the truly remarkable (\\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" including its several sub-tracks, \\"Holiday/Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\"), Green Day has constructed the first great post-alternapunk concept album. The concept, for better or worse, is the sorrow, rage, and dejection so many of us feel by the decline of a mainstream society that increasingly pushes people away from one another and stigmatizes the questioners, gives lip service to religion while hypocritically promoting blood and greed, encourages us to deal with our problems by popping pills, to say nothing of increasing the financial burdens of the average joe and jane to profit the powerful. This emotional upheaval-- larded lightly with a wistful strain of weltschmerz for the hope of progress-- is excellently captured on \\"American Idiot,\\" which in sound might owe more to The Clash, but in spirit owesmuch to Phil Ochs. <br /> <br />I am at a loss to understand any of those who do not like this album. Aside from the usual raft of political conservatives and social assimilationists, the most common complaint seems to be that being a less traditionally-hardcore punk sound, \\"American Idiot\\" somehow proves Green Day has gone soft or lost their edge. What actually seems to have happened is that they have finished growing up, and have understood that musical and lyrical exploration only strengthens an artist's power, it does not mean they have 'betrayed' their roots. <br /> <br />This album is dense, brilliant, and sure to go down in rock history as one of the all-time great concept albums. Major kudos are due to Billie Joe and the boys, for the music and for the dead-on sociocultural snapshot.

B0007N1AI6|5.0|This cd is priest back in classic form. Only weak track would be Lochness, the rest are pure classic Priest. Demonizer, Hellrider, Judas Rising, and Deal with the Devil put any other metal on the market today to shame. Buy this cd. <br />
B00000J7EI|5.0|Much like the title implies, Dark Tranquillity's sophomore effort is much like a gallery: it is a collection of various forms of art.  The entire album - songs, instrumental performances, vocal performances, and the overall vibe - follows atypical stylings.  Scandinavian folk is one of the more obvious influences upon this album.  Songs are built in movements as opposed to more typical structures, adding a sort of classical feel to the music.  _The Gallery_ has all of these qualities, and still manages to incorporate enough aggression and energy to be considered a heavy metal album. <br /> <br />The lineup here is composed of five musicians who are all highly talented at what they do.  Fredrick Johansson and Niklas Sundin play nearlly all of the guitars on this album, save for most of the acoustic/clean electric parts, which are played by bassist Martin Henriksson.  This is interesting, because later in Dark Tranquillity's career, Henriksson would replace Johansson on guitars.  While the guitars are, of course, very prominent (Dark Tranquillity are a kind of metal band, after all), the drums and bass refuse to be lost in the mix.  Henriksson plays crafty, often complex melodies which rather frequently push through even the heaviest guitar riffs.  And drummer Anders Jivarp is both thunderous and intricate, managing to finely complement the band's heavier moments without creating over-emphasized bouts of double-bass/snare flurries which many a metal drummer will often overdo. <br /> <br />There are also several moments of guest work on this album.  One of these is from the producer, the ever-hard-working Fredrick Nordstrm, who adds keyboards and piano to several songs.  Frasse Franzn plays the timpani on \\"Mine is the Grandeur...\\"  And of course, special guest Eva-Marie Larsson performs all female vocals on this album.  For their first four albums (_Skydancer_, _The Gallery_, _The Mind's I_, and _Projector_), the band has had four respective guest female vocalists,each with their own highly unique styles.  Eva-Marie performs the most out of all of these, adding her powerful voice to \\"Lethe,\\" \\"...Of Melancholy Burning,\\" and of course, the title track (where she makes an especially effective and poignant performance). <br /> <br />_The Gallery_ is the first album to feature Mikael Stanne on lead vocals (he used to be a guitarist, before their former lead singer, Anders Fridn, left the band to front fellow Gothenburg band In Flames), _The Gallery_ sports highly elaborate lyrics.  Gothic and cosmic imagery dominate Mikael's words, with a sense of dismal despair and tragedy throughout.  It is with Mikael Stanne's voice that his lyrics truly come alive, and it becomes evident that the lyrics/vocals to this band are a far cry from those of the typical metal band.  Mikael has an impressive range in his pseudo-death metal voice, ranging from snarls of fury to howls of pure despair; he is definitely one of the most emotional vocalists in a band of this nature.  There is also a brief moment of his clean voice, performed as the climax of opener \\"Punish My Heaven,\\" where he belts out the last two words of a nerve-shattering howl: \\"...it's the choice between heaven...AND HELL!\\" <br /> <br />The guitars are heavy, of course, but with a sort of dazzling, animated animosity which is atypical to many a metal band.  For instance, after the intro melody to \\"The Dividing Line,\\" there are several jagged guitar riffs which create an unmistakable metal vibe.  However, even this song succumbs to Dark Tranquillity's brilliance, especially in the bridge, where the guitars howl a beautiful harmony.  This band has mastered the art of being heavy for art's sake, so to speak. <br /> <br />And not all of the guitars are heavy, either - just listen to the intro to the title track, with the acoustic strums and clean electric leads.  \\"Mine is the Grandeur...,\\" prelude to album closer \\"...Of Melancholy Burning,\\" sports three acoustic guitar tracks, all perfectly harmonizing their melodies in a Latin-stylized theme, accompanied by the thundering of timpani beats.  This latter track is built upon a series of melodic leads, with a sweeping, yet delicate, theme which evokes a brooding feeling of tragedy, especially with Eva-Marie Larsson's uplifting vocal delivery creating an epic-feeling climax.  There is also a brief acoustic guitar finale, both complimenting the song as well as its prelude. <br /> <br />On \\"Edenspring,\\" the music starts as a relaxed bass melody (played over a scintillating cymbal rhythm) into a series of loud, fast-paced tremolo riffs, with a terrific, desperate howl from Mikael.  During the bridge, the heaviness fades and a brief but effectively somber piano solo appears.  Then a twin-guitar harmony spills in, weaving a delicate lead before the two instruments split back into the main melody. <br /> <br />\\"Lethe\\" starts with a five-string bass chord progression, played in a low-key fashion which carries a sort of dark, yet lyrical, vibe.  Then heavy guitars roar in (harmonizing well with the bass melody, as opposed to completely obscuring it), and the song builds in structure from there. <br /> <br />To listen to the album is to behold Dark Tranquillity's true power.  True as the title implies, this is Dark Tranquillity's _Gallery_ of darkly beautiful music at its best.  _The Gallery_ is, without a doubt, the definition of gothic music.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|MTV should put their music label \\"Spanking New\\" on the sophomore album from Mars Volta, because nothing, nothing is like this baby.  This 5 track symphony of... OK, I really don't know how or what words to use to describe this extraordinary, ambiguous, eccentric, over-the-top album.  OK, maybe I can think of a few words.   <br /> <br />In all consideration, \\"Frances the Mute\\" could have been pure junk, and if executed in the same way, would have still gained my utmost admiration.  As it stands, \\"Frances the Mute\\", is the most stubborn, original, unnatural, ambitious, intriguing album in a long time.  Blending metal, funk, jazz, Latin (yes, that's right, Latin), experimental, lo-fi, punk, and any other genre that you can think of.  This is everything that isn't in any other album. <br />\\"Frances the Mute\\" is the account of the late bandmate, Jeremy Ward's diary.  The CD is like a full-on nightmare of impractical sounds, vociferous guitar riffs, and vocals that impede on your ear drums.  The first single off the album, \\"The Widow\\", is the most linear and shortest of the five tracks, which equal out to 77 minutes.  The Cuban/Jazz/Pop opus \\"L'Via L'Viaquez\\" is the most upbeat song on the album.  The track, which changes pace almost 7 times in its 12:27 running time, is consistently outrageous and alluring. <br /> <br />The opener, \\"Cygnus... Vismund Cygnus\\" is unrelenting, unapologetic, unbalanced, and pushy.  Much like an onslaught on your ears, the track is nerve-racking and violent.  Pushing your ears to the limit, it's almost like they want to see what we're willing to put up with.  After several listens though, you'll be hooked to its rampant charm. <br />\\"Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore\\" - the fourth track off the album - is slow to start off, slowly building like a cheap horror film and unwinding to the point of nervousness.  Almost like something off the soundtrack to \\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.\\"  The track pulsates and rises like the undead from your worst nightmare. <br /> <br />The thirty-plus minute closer, \\"Cassandra Gemini\\", sounds like Miles Davis meets Rob Zombie meets the \\"Mission Impossible 2\\" composer.  Never has a combination like this been so awkward, or so abnormally fitting.   <br /> <br />The lyrics seem like a mix of poetry and bile, but with comparisons to Edgar Allen Poe, what would you expect?  Skewed, vibrant, and loud - no one's voice can be compared to Cedric Bixler-Zavala's.  Cedric's voice reaches such heights that you imagine the glass breaking in the background.   <br /> <br />After their somewhat unfocused debut, \\"De-Loused in the Comatorium\\", Mars Volta has officially marked their stamp on the music industry with a one-of-a-kind album, that never falls short, never sells out, never gets tedious, never ceases to impress, and more importantly, ends up sounding amazing.
B0006Z2LCE|5.0|PROBABLY MOST OF YOU WILL FIND DISSAPOINTING TO SEE THAT ANOTHER DONNA'S COMPILATION WAS RELEASED, BUT ONCE YOU HAVE THIS \\"GOLD\\" IN YOUR HANDS YOU WILL LOVE IT, THIS ONE IS EXCELLENT. I'D RATHER HAVE A COMPLETE NEW ALBUM THOUGH, WE FANS DESERVE IT.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|This movie is soooooo STUPID.   People were laughing when we were leaving the theatre (thats how stupid it was) no wonder Julia didn't show up at the premier. If I was in this film I would want to crawl under a rock. First of all the people talk so trashy and they talk about infidelity there are no scenes of them even being together IT'S ALL TALK. If you like movies that say we had an affair then show absolutely nothing about what happend and cussing and dirty language through out the film. IT IS SO SHALLOW AND STUPID. I think Jude Law is a great actor but he should had stayed away from this film. Is Natalie Portman losing her mind? Why would she want to even make such a movie?  HORRIBLE FILM
B000000OUJ|5.0|GZA's classic Wu-Banga, Liquid Swords, is arguably the best Wu-solo ever released. GZA is known as the lyrical genius of the crew, and he proves that he is one of the best writers in the rap game. RZA's beats on this one may take a while to warm to, but they truly work for GZA's monotone, raw sound and sharp lyrics. The odd thing about Liquid Swords is that, as an album, it is a definite 5 stars. In terms of GZA's solo performance though, a 4 star rating seems appropriate. There is no doubt that GZA is awesome, but the guest appearances are incredible - which brings the Genius down just a tad. <br /> <br />The track kicks off with energy on 'Liquid Swords', which, as usual, boasts samples from Kung-Fu flicks. Example number one of guests stealing the mic from GZA is 'Duel Of The Iron Mic' which features Masta Killa and Inspectah Deck. GZA begins with an average verse, then comes Masta Killa who flows beautifully over the obsure beat. Masta Killa's lyrics are on point and he sounds as wise as ever. Inspectah Deck kicks it hardcore next, and out does GZA as well. 'Living In The World Today' has good lyrics and good flow from GZA, but the beat is inappropriate for the context of the song. The beat is loaded with goofy trumpets and instrument samples, while GZA spits some dark rhymes. <br /> <br />'Gold' is a great GZA solo with a fantastic beat and 'Cold World' with Inspectah Deck is one of the few Wu tracks with a R&B hook. They form a solid base to kick off the middle of the album. 'Labels' is another cool track lyrically, where GZA shows off using the names of myriad record labels in his rhymes. '4th Chamber' is example number two of guests rocking it better than GZA. Ghostface Killah drops one of his best verses I've heard, followed by another great verse by Killah Priest (who in my opinion is a better lyricist than GZA). RZA comes with his drunken-master flow, and GZA concludes the track. GZA's verse was great, but couldn't compare to Ghostface or Priest. \\"Shadowboxing' is the second-best example, where Method Man (who I am not a huge fan of) drops an absolutely jaw-dropping couple of verses. I don't know if it's Method Man's lazy snotnose tical style, or dark dreary beat, but Meth just owns this track. <br /> <br />My favorite GZA solo track is 'Killah Hills 10304' - \\"life of a drug dealer.\\" The track drops an accurate interpretation of city life and crime. 'Investigative Reports' features Raekwon, Ghostface Killah and U-God (who is rambling about city realities on what could be called a chorus). GZA and Raekwon are very good on this track, especially GZA, who breaks out of his monotone shell a bit. 'Swordsman' and 'I Gotcha Back' have bad beats, and are not too friendly on the ears. Plus on 'I Gotcha Back', GZA is once again talking about city life and 'n****s who front' which is getting old on the album.  <br /> <br />Now - the best example of guests stealing the show. 'B.I.B.L.E [Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth].' Not only does RZA get outdone by 4th Disciple who produced this track, but Killah Priest owns the best song on the album (this one). And when I say  \\"owns\\" I meant it. It is a Killah Priest solo! This blew my mind! GZA, the lyrical genius of the Clan, let someone else conclude the album! I am glad GZA did this though, because this could quite possibly be the best Wu dart of all time. And it is without RZA's production or any true member of the clan. Killah Priest's cold, hollow and relaxing sound, accompanied by a spacy, ambiguous beat, and godlike lyrics make this my favorite dart on the entire album. Despite the fact that this album is \\"made\\" by the great guest rhhymes, it is a must own. Liquid Swords is a rap classic, and should be in the collection of every true hip-hop fan.

B00007H014|5.0|This movie, in the first few minutes can completely capture your attention and will you to see the glorious middle and finally the end to the dream. Audrey Tatou masterfully makes this movie what it is. Her enigmatic and at the same time bold style in this movie makes you care so much about her character's life and &quot;fabuleux destin&quot; (Amazing destiny). I cannot advise more than to see this movie as soon as possible. For me, for a little while at least, it made me think how much more life can hold than what we live normally.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This album is bound to get very low reviews by very very many people. For one reaon: The Widow made it to the radio-waves and EMTV-waves. Which is cool and all, but very many people will be expecting an EMTV type of album, however <br /> <br />It holds much more substance than that.
B00004Z459|5.0|A superb album that hits the spot when you're in the mood for accessible pop rock. Linkin Park appear to be berated by some for being 'manufactured'. I believe these guys enjoyed making (and touring with) this album and intended to convey exactly that, irrespective of the professional help they may have received along the way. It tickles me that some can be so arrogant as to imply that that the millions who bought and enjoy this album are morons. Agreed Hybrid theory's form is straightforward, and like all music it borrows from its peers, but I fail to see how these points exclusively constitute an argument for rubbishing it. Listen and enjoy.
B0007NFL18|5.0|this is the best 50 cent cd and i own all of them that other punk kid dont know what he is talking about!the whole cd is tight the only cd that is better than this one is g-unit beg for mercy
B0006Z2LH4|3.0|I wasn't a big fan of Cube but I thought it was ok so I decided to see this one, Cube Zero. It didn't disappoint me since my expectations weren't so high. Cube Zero is actually a prequel so it explains the reasons why people are trapped in a killer cube. There's enough gore to satisfy the most demented fan and the introduction of characters who exist outside the cube is interesting. I like that one observer feels sympathy for a woman stuck in the cube and my favorite character is the guy with the robotic eye. He's really amusing and I think he's a very good actor.   <br />   <br />Cube Zero reminds me of those cheesy but good horror movies of the 1980s. Accept it for what it is, a decent B-flick.
B00000DGUY|5.0|I was introduced to Dire Straits almost 10 years back. Earlier I listened to one of their songs and was not impressed and I even remember giving 'I don't like Dire Straits' comments to people with my face indicating ignorance...One day a radio show, an hour-long Dire Straits special changed it all. I do not remember what are the songs that was played on that show but it resulted purchase of my first Dire Straits, a 'Money for nothing' compilation tape and I was hooked to their music since then and I still consider them my favourite group of all time even after listening a lot and lot of music.  <br /> <br />I have owned all of their studio album + all Mark Knopfler albums except 'Shangri la', first in tape and in ACD format. This particular compilation sums up Dire Straits quite well. Definitely a double CD would have been better but as they have only 6 studio album, a single CD compilation is not bad as an introduction to this great band. <br /> <br />Sultans of Swing - Taken from their debut self titled album, this contains probably Mark Knopfler's most acclaimed guitar-work. It still brings shivers down my spine even after 10 years since the first listen. A true Essential and probably my second favorite Dire Straits track. <br /> <br />Lady Writer - The best track from the second album 'Communique'. A typical fast Dire Straits number. <br /> <br />Romeo and Juliet - From the third album 'Making Movies'...one of the best and most romantic Dire Straits track ever. Wonderful emotive vocal by Mark Knopfler. <br />   <br />Tunnel of Love - Also from 'Making Movies', my favorite DS album, this is my favorite DS track of all time. A true classic and a huge fan favorite... <br />  <br />Private Investigations - A slower mainly instrumental track with vocal commentry. A big hit from the fourth album 'Love over gold'. <br /> <br />Twisting by the Pool - Not from any studio album, this was released as a single. This is rock n' roll heaven.    <br /> <br />Love Over Gold [Live] - Live version of title track from 'Love Over gold'. Great. <br />      <br />So Far Away - From the fifth album 'Brothers in arms', the most successful of their career. Very atmospheric and catchy. <br /> <br />Money for Nothing - Did I called 'So far away' catchy? It is catchier. Sting contributed in this...If you listened to one track by DS, this must be it. From 'Brothers in arms'. <br />      <br />Brothers in Arms - Soldiers in a war...Brilliant mellow track having great guitar-work by the man. <br />      <br />Walk of Life -  You already heard this dozens of times. So what do I explain? Also from 'Brothers in arms'. <br /> <br />Calling Elvis - From 'On every street' album. An tribute to Elvis Presley. <br />     <br />Heavy Fuel - From 'On every street'... Another rocker... <br />     <br />On Every Street - A mellow track with starge layered instrumental, Mark KNopfler has started experimentation by this time.  <br />      <br />Your Latest Trick [Live] - Live version of the Saxophone driven track from 'Brothers in arms' album.      <br /> <br />Local Hero/Wild Theme [Live] - Live sample from his solo career as movie soundtrack composer. Superb. <br />     <br />Although as an avid fan of the group, I would ask you to go for the albums but this is probably the best introduction to the band. I am not a fan of compilation but have to give it full marks...5 stars. <br /> <br />Eagerly waiting to see Mark Knopfler live on March 7, 2005 in my city.
B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5 is awesome! From the singing to the instruments, everything is great. I remember when I first bought the cd i was not sure of Maroon 5. After listening to them, I fell in love with the cd. To everyone who has never heard this cd or is thinking about buying this cd, I definitely recommend this cd to everyone!
0767817478|5.0|I watch and love a movie like this cause it's fun and entertaining, that's it!
B00005LMBK|3.0|This review is strictly based from a Rap/Hip-Hop perspective and what a fan from that area of music could expect.  So, if that doesn't apply to you then don't, worry about it cause from a rock perspective this probably can be considered creative genius and I have no problems admitting that.    If you come from hip-hop, you're probably looking for the impact of Dan The Automator's production/influence and Del The Funky Homosapien.  The good news is that Dan's imprint is all over this thing.  If you are familiar with his stuff, you'll know that while many hip-hop elements are there, the production sounds far from typical.    The bad news is that appearances from Del (and any other actually rapping) are few.  In fact he's only on two tracks (ironically two of the bigger singles from the album, making you wonder why they didn't do this more).  I'm sure everyone's heard and developed their opinions on \\"Clint Eastwood\\", so there's no need for to really say much about it.  \\"Rock The House\\" is a great track, the horns provide a catchy sample, the pianos provide another great layer during the chorus and the subtle production lays out a nice laid-back groove.  Del, fits the track perfectly, flowing seamlessly and at others matching the beat to the precision.  Any underground hip-hop fan will be pleased with the way this turned out (and to be honest, probably wishes it was on Deltron3030 instead).  Apart from these two tracks, the album is more a fusion between hip-hop production elements or just straight up rock/pop.    The production combines nicely with Albarn and rock elements on tracks like \\"Tomorrow Comes Today\\" which has a hard thumping beat.  \\"New Genius\\" follows nicely and is more on the eerie side with the high-pitched harmonica.  The scratching in the middle of the track is a solid touch as well.  If you can get past the Spanish wailing in \\"Latin Simone\\" you'll prolly enjoy it.    At times on this album, Dan gets to shine a lot of his talent alone.  \\"Double Bass\\" allows The Automator to get creative with all sorts of different instruments, that fans have grown accustom to.  He does the same with \\"Left Hand Suzuki Method\\" using some sick bass and what sounds like a high school orchestra.    Both \\"Starshine\\" & \\"Sound Check\\" at times sound like mediocre DJ Shadow tracks (not necessarily a bad thing though).    \\"Re-Hash\\", \\"5/4\\", \\"Man Research\\", \\"Punk\\", \\"19-2000\\", \\"M1 A1\\", and \\"Dracula\\" all stay pretty far from the hip-hop side, at times being completely rock tracks.  It's pretty hard from my perspective to enjoy these songs, but I do not doubt that many rock/pop fans will.  \\"Slow Country\\" is just on some complete different level entirely.  (I failed to mention the Remix tracks at the end, because they are completely `pop'ed out for commercial play).    Basic Break down: 2 songs with raps, 4 Hip-Hop sampling instrumentals, 3 solid hip-hop/rock fusions, 8 not so hip-hop tracks, 2 straight up pop remixes.    Gorillaz does an excellent job of getting experimental and gets more creative props than Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park or whoever else.  It's safe to say that people who like rock music will defiantly enjoy this more than a hip-hop fan.  If you're coming from that hip-hop/rap perspective, this group certainly has potential and it's worth listening to.  I wouldn't recommend buying it expecting that even 1/3 of the album is geared towards you.  So from that side, the album is merely OK.  If you can open your mind up or come from a different style of music, this album could definitely end up being a lot better for you.
B0000640SA|5.0|...so says Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce). Leonard (or \\"Lenny\\") witnessed his wife's murder and in the attempt to save her, got injured and recieved short term memory loss. Now he's on he search for \\"John G\\", the man who raped and murdered his wife.<br /><br />Sounds like the usual thriller storyline...right?<br /><br />WRONG!!<br /><br />What makes \\"Memento\\" unique is the fact that the movie goes in reverse. No, not the film strip, the story. The movie begins on the last scene and works its way through each scene backwards until (at the end of the film) you reach the beginning of the story. CONFUSING, HUH? The reason for this odd story telling is to recreate the feeling of having short term memory and it succeeds. (trust me)<br /><br />The reason to get this version of the DVD is that a special hidden features exists: THE MOVIE IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER!!!<br /><br />Here's how to get it:<br /><br />Pop in the second disc > In The Main menu, Wait Until You hear lines from the film > Select the Clock Image > Answer all of the following multiple choice quesions with the letter \\"C\\" > When four pictures of a woman changing a tire appear, Put them in this order: 3,4,1,2 > Now the end credits will play in reverse and then the movie will be in chronological order! > ENJOY!!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This is a hilarious movie about a nerd in high school.  Actually, that's basically the \\"plot\\" of the movie.  I'm not going to waste time telling you about the movie, since a lot of reviews already do that.  This seems to be a movie that you either like it, or you hate it.  I love it.  I think people who were the jocks, cheerleaders, bullies and popular kids in high school are the ones who hate this movie because the movie almost seems to ignore them, and you know how much those types hate being ignored.  As for anyone else, you ought to enjoy this movie.  Even folks who were the nerdiest kids in high school ought to love this movie, especially since they couldn't possibly be as nerdy and dorky as this guy.  Since this movie has no real plot, you basically have to turn off your brain, and just enjoy!  You'll laugh so hard. <br /> <br />P.S.  It's even funnier the second time around!!!!!
B0006SSOHC|5.0|There are two kinds of moviegoers: fans of horror films and those who aren't fans of horror films. And within the horror film section there are two groups: Gory horror films or psychological horror films.<br /><br />If you fit into the Horror Films>Gory Horror Films category, this movie is perfect for you. I hate to say this, but it definitely reminded me of SE7EN, CUBE, and THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE.<br /><br />Here's the story: Two men, ADAM and DR. LAWRENCE GORDON, wake up in a disgusting bathroom, chained to pipes at opposite ends. An anonymous dead body is between them. After following some clues from a mysterious captor, the two men discover who has abducted them: THE JIGSAW KILLER (a deranged serial killer who creates disturbing situations in which his victims have to consider: \\"Would I Kill To Stay Alive?\\" or \\"How Much Blood Would I Shed To Stay Alive?\\").<br /><br />Some of the victims' situations include:<br /><br />1. Paul: \\"Find the Path through the Razor Wire\\"<br /><br />2. Mike: \\"Hurry and Program in the Numbers...\\"<br /><br />3. Amanda (my favorite): \\"The device on your head works somewhat like a reverse bear-trap...\\"<br /><br />THIS MOVIE HAS A GREAT ENDING WHICH I CAN NOT SPOIL HERE! GO SEE THIS MOVIE JUST FOR THE AMANDA/\\"LOCK JAW\\" SCENE, THE ENDING, AND THE AWESOME STORY.<br /><br />I found this movie creepy and exciting. So \\"See Saw\\".
B00005QK3W|3.0|Like most McCartney's albums, this CD contains some brilliant and original songs while some tracks make you wonder why and how they got selected. On this album, six to seven songs are really worthwhile listening to, the rest is below par.    Like on most of his albums, he plays different styles, varying from India-inspired \\"Riding into Jaipur\\" to the beautiful and catchy \\"From a lover to a friend\\" to upbeat \\"About you\\".    Highlights are \\"Lonely road\\", a beautiful melodic track with soul, well built and excellently sung. In \\"Rinse the raindrops\\" melody and lyrics are repeatedly performed in different tempers/moods. In this 10-minute jam McCartney shows he is a world class bass player and that his voice is still magic. He definitely should do such stuff more often! \\"She's given up talking\\" is an ingenious track with a musically Pink Floyd-ish feel, pity about the lyrics ...    Although better produced than most Wings albums, the production (and lyrics of some songs) could be vigourously improved. The last three albums (\\"Flaming pie\\", \\"Run Devil Run\\" and this one to a lesser extent) show that McCartney is still very capable and eager to write and perform great songs and that he has the will to experiment. If producer Nigel Godrich challenges McCartney and makes an unbiased song selection/production, then I have high expectations for the upcoming album (probably out in September 2005).    Remark: I do not understand the inclusion of the inappropriate \\"Freedom\\", a simplistic anthem with odd lyrics like \\"fight for the right to freedom\\". It does not suit the optimistic and liberal humanist (anti-landmines, rain forest protector, human&animal rights defender) McCartney always has been striving to be. Idem Eric Clapton who is playing guitar on the track... must be an Anglo-Saxion thing I do not comprehend...?
B00000IN5G|5.0|being only owning hatecrew deathroll for about six months and not owning any other cob albums, it was only natural id venture off into their other works. i was completely blown away by HCDR and was again blown away by hatebreeder. <br />this album is...i cant even explain it. this is so good. i thought it would be hard to over come HCDR, but i was wrong. this is by far better than that. this is more melodic, but yet more brutal. its hard to say exactly what it is, but i think i just told you the best way you can describe it. <br />my advise to you is to buy this album as soon as possible. after listening to this, it becomes clear to me that cob is a very important band that will probly stay with me forever. and has greatly changed my guitar style from such metallica-styled solos to more like these less tapping and melodic, yet brutal solos. trully a masterpiece.<br />i also recomend HCDR, because thats awesome as well.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Original, beautiful and haunting album. <br /> <br />Brilliant music is still being composed; Yorke's band has a sound and a status of its own. <br /> <br />Highly recommended!
0060931671|5.0|Decades before THE X-FILES made paranoia about conspiracies standard fare for popular culture, there was Thomas Pynchon's THE CRYING OF LOT 49 (it is not a coincident that man X-FILES websites also feature forums discussing Pynchon's books).  The notion that there might be a \\"World inside the world\\" (in Don Delillo's memorable phrase) had never before truly been explored in either high or popular culture, in pulp or serious fiction, in movies or TV.  Or almost.  THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE in both novel and film had presented a haunting image of a government conspiracy, and INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS was the great fifties classic of justified paranoia, but no work before had ever envisioned conspiracy on such a grand, international, and all pervasive scale.  What is even more distrubing about this book is that the conspiracy it presents is hidden in plain sight.  The protagonist of the novel, Oedipa Maas, is utterly unaware of the existence of the Tristero, yet as the book gains force she realizes that its marks can be found in every corner of society.<br /><br />This short novel is the perfect introduction to Thomas Pynchon.  Although I thoroughly enjoy his work, I will be the first to admit that he is not for everyone.  His writings contain too many obscure references (sometimes of an academic nature; frequently not), his style can at times be dense, his narrative style not always very transparent.  I personally find that he repays the effort, but because I had to struggle through the several pages in GRAVITY'S RAINBOW or V. that are less than obvious in their import I can understand what it is like for those who find most of his pages tough going.  THE CRYING OF LOT 49 is, however, not merely his most accessible work (largely because of its short length) but arguably his finest book.  I would absolutely recommend that anyone considering exploring Pynchon begin with this.<br /><br />What is remarkable is how much content is contained in the novel's less than two hundred pages of text.  It is one of those books in which almost nothing seems to happen, and yet seems stuffed to the brim.  If one sums up the action of the novel, it seems extraordinarily slim:  a woman goes to help as executor of the estate of a former lover of hers, inadvertently discovers an international conspiracy to provide an alternate mail delivery system that seems to function anarchistically to undermine the establish order, and attempts to learn all she can of the identity and existence of the mysterious Tristero.  Most of the book consists in the pondering of clues.  None of it labors over answers.  It is also not a book that delves deeply into character analysis.  Apart from Oedipa, there is not a single character that could, in E. M. Forster's famous parlance, be described as a \\"round\\" character.  The novel is populated by what he would describe as \\"flat\\" characters (not necessarily a criticism, since as Forster points out all of Dickens's characters are flat).  The book doesn't even seem to want to tell a story.  What it wants to do is evoke a mood of disassociation, of dislocation.  It wants to leave us with a sense of the unreality of our most ingrained assumptions.  And it does this brilliantly.<br /><br />THE CRYING OF LOT 49 is a pivotal modern work of literature for another reason:  it was one of the first serious works of literature that seems to be on easy terms with popular culture.  Indeed, though I have no evidence for this, I would imagine that one of its major influences may have been THE TWILIGHT ZONE.  It could be cited as a direct or indirect influence on a number of subsequent cultural products, including the aforementioned THE X-FILES.

B0007GAEW6|5.0|All I can say is this album defines music. This is what rock should be. The whole ablum journeys your ears through a labyrinth of discovery.
B000001FQ8|5.0|Folks, I'll make this short.  This record has no anthems on it, no groundbreaking rock 'n roll-as-great-art tunes like \\"Scarecrow\\" and \\"Small Town\\".  It is an understated, subtle masterpiece of a man exploring the depths of his soul and finding both tremendous pain and great dignity.  JM goes to many places in the heart on this one, and each journey is remarkable in its own way.  He is the type of plain spoken songwriter who can speak volumes in just a few lines when other writers would need entire books, screenplays and albums to say.  Example:  \\"There's a void in my heart / I can't seem to fill /  I do charity work when I believe in the cause / but my soul it bothers me still\\".  Yes, we've all been there ... some folks never find their way out of that place.    I think JM did find his way out, especially on the advent of his third marriage, which came (I think) after the recording of \\"Whenever We Wanted\\".  On this record, his second marriage was breaking up do to his repeated infidelities.  To give you an example of his mindset during the recording of this record, here's a quote he made regarding the demise of his union to Vicki Mellencamp: \\"I want to get back together, but I really don't see what would change, and I don't want to hurt this woman anymore.  She doesn't deserve it.\\"    I think that this record represents a time in JM's life in which, deep in his heart, he felt truly lost.  You can hear it in his voice and in his words, and that is a lot of what makes this record a masterpiece.
B000066SBB|5.0|Aretha's best work, showcased here, proves that she has justly earned her title as Queen of soul despite some ups downs in her long career. Aretha took a long time to establish herself but once signed to Atlantic, she found a producer (Jerry Wexler) who was able to make the most of her distinctive talents.<br /><br />Aretha has had many major hits in America although she has not been particularly successful in the British singles charts. During her time with Atlantic, Aretha had two UK top ten hits (Respect, I say a little prayer) and two other UK top twenty hits (Don't play that song, Spanish Harlem). All those hits are included here, together with many of Aretha's other classic recordings for Atlantic, some of which were minor UK hits but all of which did much better as singles in America. These classics include Think, You make me feel like a natural woman, I never loved a man they way I loved you, Chain of fools, Do right woman do right man, Angel, Since you've been gone and Until you come back to me.<br /><br />With Aretha's distinctive voice and delivery, her cover versions are always interesting. Surprisingly, Satisfaction (Rolling Stones) is omitted, but Bridge over troubled water (Simon and Garfunkel), Oh no not my baby (Maxine Brown) and Let it be (Beatles) are among those included.<br /><br />Aretha eventually left Atlantic, joining Arista in 1980. This rejuvenated her career although she never quite achieved the level of success that she had in her early years with Atlantic. However, she had two major international hits via duets - Sisters are doing it for themselves (with the Eurythmics) and I knew you were waiting for me (with George Michael), the latter becoming a number one hit in Britain (where it remains her only number one hit) and America. She also just missed the UK top ten with Who's zooming who - but most of her UK hits in the eighties were minor hits, just as they had been in her Atlantic years.<br /><br />This compilation, spanning several decades of Aretha's music, clearly shows why she is regarded as the Queen of soul. There are many Aretha compilations to choose from, but if you want one covering her whole career, this is as good as you are likely to find.everal decades of Aretha's music, clearly shows why she is regarded as the Queen of soul.

0375759174|5.0|Jane Austen just knocks me out.  She wrote in a living room full of extended family,she wrote longhand when paper was not so plentiful as it is today and mistakes could not be so frequently wadded up and tossed to the landfill, she wrote without the instant editing afforded by personal computers, she wrote without benefit of the MFA programs and workshops we are assured today are the only route to producing literary art, and yet she wrote beautifully and for all time.  Every word counts, every character is real, every scene pulses along in a swift current.  Her work can be many things at once: social satire, romance, social criticism, a comedy of manners.  It is a portrait of a certain society in a certain time, it is a universal commentary on human foibles, gender relations, class and money.      NORTHANGER ABBEY was one of Austen's earliest mature works, and it stands alongside PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and the rest.  She does something different in this one: she uses her own novel to, among other things, satirize the popular literature of her time, especially Ann Radcliffe's MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO.  She sets out telling us that her protagonist, Catherine Morland, is not your typical heroine, that in fact she's ordinary without special talents, a dramatic home life or heart-stopping beauty.  She belongs to the audience that was vacuuming up the burgeoning genre of popular literature of her time, and the second half of the story largely finds her attempting to live like a heroine in her favorite gothic romance, only to have reality jump out of the closet at her at every turn.  The first half of the story is the set up for the second, the comedy of manners that positions her in the company of the residents of Northanger Abbey, whose name conjures up in her mind a dramatic ruin of a castle.  There is, in fact, quite a bit of suspense that keeps you up late, just not the kind Catherine has in mind. If you pay attention in the first half of the book, you will find the \\"guns\\" neatly planted that go off in the last act.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Every once in a while a song or singer comes along whose voice is able to draw the listener in and feel any emotion he wants us to feel. Josh Groban is one of those singers. For someone as young as he is he has incredible range and clarity and you can feel the passion he ha sin every song that he sings. In My Confession you can really feel the desperation as he lays everything on the line for the person he loves. Even if his style of music isn't your favorite, he is definatly worth listening to because his talent simply can't be denied.
B00009RDG9|4.0|I love it when two of my favorite actors are in a movie together. When one's off screen, you have the other to keep you entertained. And when they're on screen together, it's movie-making at its best. The plot itself leaves a bit to be desired. The film's production was stop-and-go for so long, I heard that the director changed direction before it was finished. My guess is that some of what was lost was what was missing from the movie, particularly in regards to understanding Benicio's character properly. Nonetheless, Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro shine throughout. <br />P.S. Being an animal lover, I love that two leads in a movie are pro-animal too.
B000001ED1|5.0|I was not too familiar with Joan Osborne. The only exposure I can remember is hearing \\"One of Us\\" on the radio a few times and feeling that it was a pretty good song. So I kind of bought this album as a 'flyer' and because of some of the positive feed-back that posters have previous left. Boy did I luck out. This is one of the best albums I have ever heard... by anyone! Rich in tempo, beautifully written lyrics, show caseing a very veratile voice in Joan Osborne, backed by some excellent musicians. Every single song on this album is excellent. I can only believe that this album wasn't more commercialy successful and better known is because of the length of the songs. Most are in excess of 5 min. an eternity for commercial radio. My only regreat is that I didn't buy/find this album years ago. This is a real musical treasure.
B00003CXRP|3.0|In my opinion this movie isn't worth owning really. I meen for one I felt that the whole thing was totaly ripping off from the Hatchet which had a much better premis. Not to say that Tom Hanks isn't a good actor because he is but I felt it was missing something crucial that would have made it into a better movie. On a side note I think it would have been much better if it was more about how Tom Hanks character comes back after being marooned on the island and learning how to adapt back into civilization.
B0007NFL18|5.0|Come correct y'all this album is off the chain and will be holding it down all year every track hits a different tone and style and Olivia is hot on both tracks she hits up. People need to understand that diss tracks are how 50 makes his money and the only reason that he hits on Fat Joe, the poser, and nas is for the reaction and the sales i mean come on man how soft do you have to be to get some tricks name on your body for real.   <br />P.S. The Game needs to come correct, 50 is his daddy he should know better.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This movie is one of the most wonderful I have ever seen. It is terribly hard for movies to make me cry, but by the end of this movie, I felt so connected to the characters that I was in tears. The story is beautiful, the costumes and set are brilliant, and Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet have Oscar-quality performances.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Wow! Let me say that American Idiot is a great album and Green Day has NOT sold out even though the have gained a following of sheep-like teens who claim \\"OMG boulevard of broken dreams is my favorite song!\\" Yes the masses have invaded, but the essence of Green Day is still the same.(power chords and the f bomb, though they would probably murder me for censoring myself)This album is definatly a step forward in Green Day history. Though all the members are at least 32, they still act like a bunch of 20 year olds on stage and are still their obnoxious selves.
B0007O38F8|2.0|I have to say that there are several good tracks on the album, and in my opinion that's the only thing that saves it. 2 songs, which are pretty good, come to my mind right away: \\"I'm Supposed to Die Tonight\\" and \\"Position of Power\\". The rest is generally same old stuff, nothing that haven't been said before. Most songs on the album lack substance, and lyrics are pretty mediocre. If you've listened to previous albums you will notice that 50 repeats a lot of stuff he said before, and his rhymes don't seem to change much. Well, you can go with the hype and buy this album, but honestly, it's not worth the money...    Last note. If you are looking for club bangers with nice beats, and don't really care about quality of rhymes or topics covered, then I would say that this could be a decent buy. If you are looking for something deeper which actually has meaning, steer away from this album.    -F1
B0002X314C|4.0|Kanye ruled the hip-hop world in 2004 and now he is after the R&B world. John Legend the Debut artist from Kanye's GOOD music imprint is a classically trained pianist and an amazing singer. A quick glance at the liner notes shows that Legend co-produced every track and wrote all his own lyrics. This is definitely the sign of an artist who wants to control his career and make it a long lasting one. Used To Love U (3) is a really awesome song that has a perfect sample in it to make both the club and the bedroom hype. That is the general vibe of this whole album. Legend mixes old school soul with modern day hip-hop sounds to deliver a very impressive R&B album. Mostly upbeat love songs, but thanks to the Kanye touch they stand out from the typical. The beautiful ballad \\"Ordinary People\\" is just amazing, just Legend on the keys and vocals. The guests are kept to a minimum. Of course Kanye has to pop in for an appearance but he spits his typical plain man rap and the Big Boss Dog Snoop stops in for a smoothed out verse on \\"I Can Change\\" which has Snoop saying he will give it all up for one woman. The terrific Miri Ben-Ari also has a few spots on here with her violin. If you are looking for a new version of the Ol' School soul that your folks have in their record crates then this is the album for you.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|THE BAND: Rob Halford (vocals), Glenn Tipton (guitar), K.K. Downing (guitar), Ian Hill (bass), Scott Travis (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (2005) 10 tracks clocking in at just under 53 minutes. Included with the disc is a 14-page booklet containing artwork (no band photos), song credits/lyrics, and thank you's. Recorded at Old Smithy (Worcestershire, UK) and Sound City (San Francisco, CA). There are two versions of this disc available - a hard cover case with music disc only, and a 'dual-disc' featuring a single disc with music on one side and a DVD on the other (DVD features a brief documentary and footage from seven live songs on their 2004 \\"Reunited\\" tour). Label - Sony/BMG.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Judas Priest is back on the heavy metal scene in 2005. \\"Angel Of Retribution\\" is a very heavy album with a few lighter songs thrown in the mix. It's been a long 15 years since Halford put his name on a Priest album (\\"Painkiller\\", 1990). Judas Priest had struggled since the day Halford left the band - putting out only 2 mediocre studio albums with Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens at the helm. The original (4 member) line up is back - Rob Halford's vocals are finely tuned and there are plenty of his demon growls and signature high-pitched screams; dueling axes from KK Downing and Glen Tipton have never sounded better; Ian Hill is steady as ever on bass. Scott Travis (drums - from 1990's album \\"Painkiller\\") rounds out the quintet. \\"Retribution\\" rocks heavy with the exceptions being \\"Angel\\", \\"Worth Fighting For\\", and \\"Eulogy\\"... these 3 songs are still very good - just slower. Early picks as the faster/harder favorites would be the first two tracks - the intro \\"Judas Rising\\" leading into \\"Deal With The Devil\\", and track eight \\"Hellrider\\". The other tracks will grow on you - it's all chillingly good - no traces of filler. The tracks here are remniscent of old Priest as well as Halford's band in the 90's \\"Fight\\". Powerful double-bass drumming and screeching guitars dominate. Plenty of aggression, optimism and energy. Kerrang and Rolling Stone magazines give this disc two postive ball-busting reviews. Not to mention this old Priest line up stealing the show at the 2004 Ozzfest. Any fan of the band or Halford's solo material owes it to him/her self to get this disc. This is an album designed to both delight the faithful and to introduce metal's new listeners (the kids) to the timeless sound of an old classic metal band in top form. Old school metal is back! The flip side of the disc is the DVD - giving you a 40 minute documentary of the making of this album, as well as 7 live tracks (featuring old standards, \\"Living After Midnight\\", \\"Hellion/Electric Eye\\", \\"Metal Gods\\", \\"Hell Bent For Leather\\", etc). Is this 2005 release on line with some of their classic 80's material - ALMOST. Some reviewers have bashed the dual-disc and its thickness... I for one have not had any issues playing either side. Great dual-disc package (4.5 stars).n, optimism and energy. Kerrang and Rolling Stone magazines give this disc two postive ball-busting reviews.

B00005JMYI|4.0|This was a very funny movie, but I couldn't even tell it was unrated. It did not add raunchy, funnier and cruder scenes, which I had hoped. But even without that it is still pretty funny.
B00004YX39|5.0|Donald Fagen and Walter Becker better known as Steely Dan,had been transferred to MCA Records from ABC after MCA bought out ABC in 1979. This seven-track album would be their last before disbanding in early 1981 and reforming in late 1999 or early 2000. Hits from this album include TIME OUT OF MIND,BABYLON SISTERS and HEY NINETEEN. The latter two appeared on A DECADE OF STEELY DAN. We still hear the musical weirdness of Fagen and Becker. That weirdness would continue on Fagen's 1982 Warner Bros. solo debut THE NIGHTFLY. The other songs are good.
B0007GAEW6|3.0|The problem here is, you need to really be \\"into\\" what they do. These guys are one of the most original bands to come in a while. and i'm not suprised since at the drive-in was great too. i love this record... when its not driving me nuts. 2 and half minutes of what sounds like that noise you hear when bands leave the stage with thier instruments still on after a finale... its just... annoying. perhaps i'm too radio formatted in my ear. not sure... i love long songs, preludes, jams, etc. but when its just some keyboard sound for two plus minutes before you get to the actual friggin song.... well, that can be frustrating. i can totally appreciate that these guys do what they want and are creating something different and yet with such musicianship and ear for melody... but at times creative and artistic expression can become the observers disinterest. thats a fine line. and sometimes this record just crosses it. i find my finger on the fast forward button to get to certain parts of the record just so i can start enjoying it. guys.... stop it. and dont tell me those parts are integral to the songs. or how about the three minutes of a great jam section but recorded at half volume on track 4. I suggest anyone who plans on buying this get a CD burner and edit themselves a version that doesn't waste so much time to get the \\"good parts\\". However, that being said, there's ALOT of them. get it. just be patient.
B00000DCH9|5.0|This album is Billy Joel's second overall,but the first distributed by Columbia Records. It was released in early 1974(Joel said this on 2000 YEARS-THE MILLENIUM CONCERT nearly 26 years later),spawning hits like YOU'RE MY HOME,CAPTAIN JACK and of course,the title track which would earn Joel that same title by reporters to this very day. YMH,CJ and THE BALLAD OF BILLY THE KID would be recorded live in 1980 for 1981's SONGS IN THE ATTIC. The latter track would again be recorded live on December 31,1999 for 2000 YEARS. The title track and CJ would be recycled for 1985's GREATEST HITS VOL. 1 & VOL. 2. The other songs are great.
0345298349|5.0|Now that's what I call a novel.          Gorky Park has the plot and trappings of a modern thriller, but the ennui and character depth of a classic. That Smith has been able to bring these two styles of writing into perfect harmony speaks of his status as a modern master.          Gorky Park follows a murder investigation conducted by Arkady Renko, a Moscow homicide investigator whose unremarkable exterior hides a steel core of resolve that drives him to the point of ruin, again and again.          Arkady is the soul mate of Hieronymous Bosch, the LAPD homicide investigator who is featured in the popular Michael Connely series. Fans of either author should automatically pick up the other; each series has the same appeal of a bone-weary old-school investigator who will stop at nothing to close his case, even if it means career (or actual) suicide.         Arkady is a fascinating character, full of sadness and mystery. Smith has many strengths, and number one on the list is imbuing his characters with a depth and realism that make us care about them intensely. Number two is evoking the peculiar atmosphere of Russian nationalism, at a time when even the diehard communists are starting to look over their shoulder at the advancing wave of global capitalism. Smith's third strength is dialogue; every sentence that Arkady utters is an iceberg, with volumes of hidden meaning submerged beneath the words.          These elements are sometimes portrayed bleakly, but there is also a sense of joy in these books. We admire Arkady, and laugh along with him at a world that doesn't always make sense. He is kind of like a nationalistic superhero, with a fierce Russian pride that extends to the Russian people, but not to the government. There is real pleasure to be had in watching Arkady do his job, his way.          The plot is a somewhat standard modern thriller, with a series of murders linked to a wealthy American fur trader. Anyone who likes crime procedure novels will enjoyseeing Arkady blend old school techniques with the sometimes woefully inadequate modern equipment at his disposal.          If you enjoy modern novels, but always feel a little guilty when reading them, I urge you to pick up this book. The pleasures are all there, but this book also has something to say about the human spirit, and you will be the better for having read it.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|For those of us who just love the theatrics, lush beauty, and drama of theater, we cannot help but be mesmerized by this movie.  However, the reaction this film received in the movie theater I attended best sums up the overall reception.  About forty minutes into the film, about 4-5 people walked out of the theater.  When the movie ended, though, it received applause from the audience -- that speaks for itself because, come on, how often do you get applause anymore these days for movies?  (In Los Angeles, mind you.)   <br /> <br />Strangely enough, right after listening to the chorus of cheers, I walked out and listened to a young woman complain: \\"I take back what I said about her [Emmy Rossum] sounding like a 16-year-old, she sounds like a 12-year-old.\\"  Personally, I wanted to take her aside and ask her whether she knew what a 'soprano' is or not, that sopranos are supposed to sing high, and the character of Christine called for a soprano... but that's a story for another day. <br /> <br />So there you have it.  Some loved it, some hated it.  I love entertainment in all its forms and I don't really subscribe to the elitist attitudes a lot of movie snobs tend to display, so I absolutely fell in love with this gorgeous movie.  The same quote used to describe Andrew Lloyd Webber could be used here to describe his movie: \\"Let's face it, no one in the world loves Andrew Lloyd Webber but the public.\\"  Critics and the like have a reputation for snubbing him, but still, his works appeal to those of us with more common tastes, it seems, which is just fine by me.  Even more amusing is that while Roger Ebert slammed the movie, he perplexed even himself by still recommending it towards the end of his review because of the sheer spectacle and look of the film is undeniably fantastic. <br /> <br />The look of the film is fantastic.  It's gorgeous, the sets are gorgeous, the costumes are gorgeous, and the so are the actors.  Some may say while it's got appearance, it lacks substance, but seriously, one could have said the same for Moulin Rouge.  Both are rather simplistic stories with high-amped visuals.   <br /> <br />The movie remains rather faithful to the theater version and serves as a wonderful way to make up for not seeing Phantom on stage.
B00009V8Z9|4.0|i jus saw this guy in concert today at the one tree hill tour, and i'd have to say, without him, the show would've been so boring. this guy is crazy. he's incredibly energetic, and he just gives the crowd so much energy too. u can't really tell how good this guy is just by listening to his cd, u'd have to see him live to believe me. some artists are only good when in the studio, but this dude is good in the studio, and even BETTER live. amazing. im speechless. too bad his songs are mostly for chicks
0440238609|5.0|This series is a cross between Paradise Lost and Chronicles of Narnia, and I think it is a wonderful read for adults as well as teens.  His Dark Materials pulls you into another world entirely, and I was captivated from the beginning of the first book to the end of the third.  The Golden Compass takes place in a world different from ours, The Subtle Knife shows us how many different worlds including ours are intertwined, and then The Amber Spyglass introduces the spiritual/ immortal worlds.  The colorful worlds achieve an amazing dimension unlike most books- you feel as if you are reading something that creates a 4 or 5 dimensional feel and not just 3-D.<br /><br />This series is much darker than many fantasy books, and I would not recommend it for children under the age of 12.  I do, however, recommend it to all teens and adults alike.
0393035158|2.0|Sam Adams is a doctoral candidate who has written an earnest tract about the evils of organized religion and the beauty of rationality in resolving the world's ills.  As I read it, the image of college bull sessions about the \\"meaning of it all,\\" and similar ruminations came to mind.  In 30 years or so, Mr. Adams may look back at his initial effort and say:  \\"Ah, but I was young then.\\" <br /> <br />This is a time-worn argument, and organized religion certainly presents a broad target for attack.  But the case is greatly weakened by assuming that all followers of organized religion are fundamentalist literalists who believe in \\"myths\\" and other unprovable beliefs.  Adams seems to forget that while in the name of religion much harm has been done, also in the name of religion much of what we call western Civilization has evolved through the efforts of the Church.  Islam, too, and other religions have provided the foundations for not only personal behavior, but also the stimulation of culture.   <br /> <br />The idea that rationality and scientific reasoning will make us all happy and secure, or at least point us in the right direction, is also an old idea that motivates individuals.   But the arguments in all this are too often simplistic and formulistic to engage one seriously.  One is tempted to say, despite all of the research and the undoubted truth of many of his statements, \\"...come off it; enough already!\\"
B0002OERI0|4.0|<br />As rock operas go, Green Day's brilliant and ambitious \\"American Idiot\\" isn't a traditional example. Listeners must ignore the inevitable comparisons to The Who's \\"Tommy.\\" While \\"American Idiot\\" tells a powerful story of people living their lives having fallen through the cracks of society, the CD possesses only two true rock opera anthems, Jesus of Suburbia and Homecoming. The rest of the CD consists of invidual songs that tie into the story as a whole. Think episodic like \\"Star Wars\\" rather than a long, sprawling epic in the mold of \\"War and Peace.\\" <br /> <br />Taken individually, the songs can be hit or miss. American Idiot, Holday, Are We the Waiting, She's a Rebel, and the aforementioned Jesus of Suburbia are standouts, but the real star of this 13 track compliation is the haunting Boulevard of Broken Dreams, a striking melodic trip down one man's sense of solitary and dispare with only a dark future in sight. <br /> <br />As a whole, \\"American Idiot\\" is brilliant not because each track surpasses the previous, but rather because of what Green Day tries to accomplish. Shooting for the stars and just missing isn't a reason to be disappointed, but rather impressed with how close a brush with greatness this is.
B00000DGUY|2.0|While this greatest hits collection will satisfy distant fans of DS (all the songs are excellent), it will disappoint others more familiar with the band.  Its pretty much the type of CD you expect to be marketed on late night TV - just the immediately recognizable \\"hits\\" with later tracks thrown in.  From the early period, where is Wild West End, Down to the Waterline, even Six Blade Knife, Comminque, Once Upon a Time in the West, Where Do You Think You're Going, or maybe Follow Me Home.  From the mid period, leaving out Skateaway is unforgiveable. Later period is covered well (but given the paucity of earlier material of greater substance how did the producers then cull three cuts from the On Every Street album?). Since there isn't much alternative for DS fans, it probably warrants purchase.  It is so insulting in content though, hold out until better offerings come along - if you can wait that long.
6305897786|1.0|If you're looking for a movie that has some in your face thrills and chills you better stay away from this one. I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen and I found myself losing interest with the characters and ultimately the entire movie as well. Since this was a slow moving plot with very little fx, there at least should have been some suspense to keep me on the edge of my seat throughout, and this offered absolutely nothing. Johnny Depp's performance was o.k., but his character and the entire film was very flat and boring.
0446677450|2.0|This book opens your mind to the educational system flaws and other norms regarding career paths.  This book also gets you excited about working for yourself and the \\"ownership society\\".  But I'm afraid it does little else.  It provides a lot of hype and tells no details of how to accomplish anything.  Stories of making thousands of dollars off forclosures in only hours.  Buying luxury cars after purchasing your first rental income property.  This sounds more like an infomercial than learning material.  If you read this book I recommend you immediately read The Millionaire Mind and The Unofficial Guide to Real Estate Investing.  These two books will take your head out of the clouds and give you some good instruction on making money in real estate.  Also stop buying books here and get them at your local library.  All the new releases are there for free.
B0006GAOBI|4.0|If you are a fan of Donnie Darko, you'll buy this item reguardless of what I say anyways, and the movie itself is great, with two never before seen scenes added and commentary by Kevin Smith, but the rest of the material doesn't really add up to the price. If you haven't seen it before, buy the theatrical version first.
B00000APLB|3.0|Interesting but hardly great. Especially interesting as a keepsake if you were a fan during their mid-1970s burnout phase. Disc two starts off with what was Side 3 in the lp format, a small club appearance (the El Mocambo?) in Toronto that coincided with Keef's infamous heroin bust. It's the best part of the CD or LP, this 20 or 25 minutes of bluesy, ballsy, bare-bones bashing about. This is the way the Stones should have been playing, in small clubs, where the crowd could see the band and the band could talk, really talk, with the crowd. There's great interplay here between Jagger, the rest of the band, and the audience that's both humorous and intimate. The CD is worth buying for these tracks along. The rest of the CD is pretty lifeless.  <br /> <br />The other interesting thing is the artwork by Andy Warhol, a much more interesting take on a portrait of the band than the disco-like cover of Black and Blue. The art was even better in LP format where it was larger, but what can ya do? <br /> <br />The Stones were past their live performance peak once Mick Taylor and his virtuoso playing were gone. The arena gig portion of this is a fascinating look at a band in decline; what's also fascinating is the stark contrast of the El Mocambo gig and how oddly great they sounded in front of small beer-y audience playing a simple little blues tune.
B00005Q4CS|1.0|This movie was very beutiful, but it was just too depressing. I have better ways to spend two hours than to watch something so sad.
B00009ATIX|5.0|Ignore the story, ignore the dialogue; this is one of the most beautiful and cinematic films I have ever seen. The score (by minimalist, synth-loving Cliff Martinez, now well-known for his score to Wicker Park) carries the film and is so well edited and meshed with the scenes and cuts, it is unforgettable. The cinematography in this film is some of the best I have ever seen, lighting, perspective, angles, all rendered near-perfect. Just a gorgeous movie to watch. A great feature on the DVD: isolated music score--watch this film on a widescreen, flat panel tv, music only (draw the curtains, close the doors; be sure to have your surround system placed correctly)...it will draw tears. After you've really 'watched' the film, go back and listen to the story; this is NOT an 'I'm bored on Friday night, let's rent a flick' kind of film. you have to take your time with it, but it's worth it in the end.
0156030209|5.0|I usually do not read novels from the the NY Bestseller Lists, because they usually don't live up to the hype. However, over the past year I've picked this book up a dozen times and was just never able to leave the store with it. I finally purchased with a gift card and read it. Wow! Was I ever surprised. <br /> <br />I don't agree with most of the other reviewers in that it started out slow. I was immediately sucked in and really wish that I had started it early on a Saturday morning so that I could've just plowed through it. <br /> <br />Pi's (Martel's) narration constantly makes you wonder what is going to happen next. The only thing you know is that he lives. He makes you realize how small we are on this planet and that life exists and goes on outside of the bubble in which we each live. I highly recommend this to everyone.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I'm a HUGE fan of punk and garage music, anything from the Ramones to the Hives to even the White Stripes. I've been listening to Green Day for several years now, and I've since gotten all their albums. This is definately not as punk as Dookie and Insomniac, but this album is a masterpiece. The songs make so much more sense when you find out the story behind the whole album. In the \\"story\\", there are characters like Jesus Of Suburbia, St. Jimmy, and Whatshername (like the song titles), and they pop up during the entire album (especially Jesus Of Suburbia). Some people think Green Day has become sell-outs because this album is selling so well and Boulevard Of Broken Dreams is such a popular song with Pop music fans. It's really disappointing to me that Boulevard of Broken Dreams is such a huge hit, the people that like it now probably think Green Day is like those other trashy bands Simple Plan, etc., but from a true music standpoint this is a remarkable album, even though it isn't your normal Green Day.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|The Priest is BACK and this album really RULES !! Judas Rising is a perfect openener :) ! All along the cd, there are a lot of different styles, from the beautiful and sincere ballad \\"Angel\\", to more classic Priest material such as \\"Wheels of fire\\" or \\"Deal with the Devil\\", and more agressiv and powerful songs like \\"Hellrider\\" and \\"Demonizer\\" and finally, the \\"epic\\" Lochness, a 13 minutes song of pure beauty !! <br />This album is definitely a must have for every Priest fan, and every metal fan :) !
B0007GAEW6|3.0|Volta's latest is nowhere near as good as De-loused. Its missing that one element, catchy songs. Yes De-loused was prog rock, but under it all were stiull catchy songs that made you move. Most of those are gone now in favor of even more prog material (if you can believe that). Most songs now have an intro/outro that is filled with noises and filler. Some of these are okay, but some are extremely annoying (see the outro at the end of song 1, with a high pitched female voice). Also it seems with \\"Frances\\" Volta has gone even more into the realm of Latin rythms and Salsa music. This makes for the best song,\\"L'Via\\" and starts off in Spanish, but segways nicely into a breakdown with latin drums and some interesting noodling by Omar.    The Main fact is they are missing Rick Rubin to reign them in when their ideas run too wild. Rubin provides the creative push and I also think the ear for a melody. Volta seems to have forgotten a lot of that with Frances. Maybe the uber-tight pants cut off cirulation to their brains.    They also play arena tours now which is completely unlike what a band like that should be doing.    Is this still better than 99.9% of all the stuff being released today, YES. Is it better than De-loused in the Comatorium, NO. I hope Cedric and Omar don't turn their backs even further on their ATDI influences. This album borders on both magnificent work, and pretentious tripe. Then again, what great art doesn't?
B0007N1AI6|4.0|Some albums have to grow on you, NOT this one.   From the monstrous opener \\"Judas Rising\\" till the operatic \\"Lochness\\" this album grabbed me immediately.  I highly recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys Heavy Metal or hard rock music.  However, if you're a Priest fan, you'll be in heaven.   <br />  <br />\\"Angel Of Retribution\\" is filled with screaming vocals, crunching riffs, back and forth guitar solos, double-bass drums from the very first song.  It's good.  VERY good.  This album will not disappoint at ALL.    <br /> <br />Anyone out there that needs any reminder of how unique this band is, this CD should provide the answer
B0000029GA|5.0|Illmatic by Nasir Jones is the greatest hip-hop/rap album ever made  <br />in the history of mankind.
0786868694|2.0|Nigella Lawson is a good wholesome sort of cook, not interested in the glitzy, ritzy, fashionable, ego tripping and frankly bonkers style of cooking that is found in abundance in cook books these days, you know the sort of thing \\"sea bream in tangerine and peanut sauce on a bed of wilted dandelion leaves\\".<br /><br /> She seems by and large to be interested in nourishing and old school food, here she presents a collection of punchy and unfussy recipes in her usual twinkling and engaging format.<br /><br /> She is often accussed of being an ok cook and a great celebrity but I think this is nonsense, she is far to intelligent and interested by her craft to ever be intoxicicated by the cult of celebrity.<br /><br /> She writes wonderfully well, so much so that a large dilemma is often deciding whether to cook her food or just read about it novel style! The photography is splendid too, the food and Ms Lawson looking equally stunning and deleicious..
B0007OCG56|4.0|The best two movies I've seen in the last year are Spanglish and Sideways, because they both make great fun of Southern Californians and their Neurosis.  I havn't been to the state for at least 10 years, but they seem to love to come to where I live, and they are a wierd bunch of lunatics.  Observing Southern Califonians is very entertaining and funny.  I think every side of their lunacy is presented in these two movies.  But Spanglish has the added bonus of one of the most beautiful woman I have seen on film in a long time.  Which reminds me of the other thing I like about Southern California, the most beautiful women in the word live there.
0380977788|5.0|I am an avid reader and a huge fan of everything Neil Gaiman has his fingers in.  I've read almost all of his novels and graphic novels, but until he started coming out with children's books (namely, The Day I Swapped My Dad...), was unable to share them with my son. <br /> <br />I ordered Coraline, not realizing it was a children's book, however I was most pleasantly surprised.   <br /> <br />My son is not big on reading, in fact, it's difficult to find things that he is willing to read from start to finish.  Happily, Coraline has been added to that list (and in theory, anything Gaiman writes for kids from now on). <br /> <br />While a little twisted for younger people, it's sometimes that bizzare perspective that will captivate children.  It's a little creepy and quite suspenseful, and Coraline is the sort of character you can identify with.  Additionally, you can empathize with her desire to explore an alternate reality as well as her later desire to return to familiar surroundings.  I think that children who are approaching puberty will very much relate to the story that emerges within this book. <br /> <br />I love being able to share Neil Gaiman with my son.  I love that one of my favorite authors has spurred his interest in reading a little more. <br /> <br />It's not your standard children's fiction by any stretch of the imagination, but for kids who aren't interested in standards and who are reluctant to read books that are so sterile and contrived that they simply cannot relate, maybe turning to darker fiction is the solution.  It is in my case :)
B0007GAEW6|5.0|alright first of all, for a guy that gave Sam Prekop a good rating? you shouldnt even be allowed to have an opinion of the mars volta.  John Theodore is one of the best drummers of our time, and Omar is one of the greatest guitarists of our time also.  The lyrics are incredibly deep, and the cd offers you a trip to take inside The Mars Volta.  This isn't a CD for everybody, and yes its very different.  Its unique, and brings a taste of its own.  The Volta is the band needed right now to open up the closed minds of the music industry, and Frances the Mute is a great album worth buying and listening to.
6305842442|4.0|Personally, I prefer the original release. I liked the voice over and the happy ending.  I thought the Unicorn dream thing was kind of off the subject. I've been trying to find a copy of the original release but no luck so far. Overall the movie is still one of my favorites of all time. I even had the PC Game. Directors cuts aren't always better in my opinion, look at the crap they are releasing for Star Wars these days with scenes added that are no use to the plot and most are so obvious.  The only recent extended version of a movie I really enjoyed was of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. These extended versions were fantastic. But still, if you like Sci-fi I think Bladerunner is a winner.
B00005ATQM|5.0|I'll be brief. The album is a classic as it is. Now put this into a 24 bit Suround or stereo sound, recording quality is fantastic. A must have if your looking to replace your abused cd version and your DVD player can play the DVD audio format.
B0006GAOCW|5.0|Kate Holmes and Marc Blucas are amazing in this movie. They really look as if they are in love. Not many actors and actresses can pull off that kind of chemistry on set. A job well done by the director. <br />And there is Michael Keaton who did a great job as the President and the father-daughter relationship with Kate Holmes was very convincing. I can't help watching the movie again and again. It's sooo good. This must be the best fairy tale story I've ever seen.
B0007NFL18|5.0|Thank you 50  This is the best album from g unit ever...If dont have this album you are weird...cant wait till DETOX <br /> <br />
B0000CABBW|5.0|Whale Rider is a beautiful movie, you will love it and find it meaningful.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Dookie was an alright CD, but then Green Day started slipping. \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" is one of the most irritating Green Day songs so far. I can't believe so many people like that damn song, it's annoying! A lot of people actually think Green Day is punk, but they're actually just pop. There really aren't any punk bands around anymore because punk is dead. I don't get how this crap is supposed to \\"save rock.\\" This crappy music is the anthem to dumbass teenagers smoking, getting wasted, and having unprotected sex. Green Day is the anthem to morons in general. F*** Green Day, that's all I have to say.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|This is no doubt a good debut album from Scottish band Franz Ferdinand, but with all they hype surrounding them, I expected more. All of the songs are catchy and well-written, but I find that they blend together, which resulted in my having to lower my rating from five stars to four. Still though, it's a good album, definitely worth a listen. There are a few standout tracks, and a bit more filler than I usually like, but I know I'll still be awaiting further releases from the band. Hopefully they'll improve on their sophomore effort. <br /> <br />The album starts out with 'Jacqueline'. This song actually begins so quietly that I thought my CD player was broken until I listened closer. Basically we only hear vocals from the lead singer and a guitar so light it's barely audible. After about 45 seconds the music starts up with the same head-bopping appeal that made 'Take Me Out' such a hit. The lyrics are catchy as well, with a simple (put not overly-plain) chorus that makes it easy for people to fall in love with instantly. The second song, 'Tell Her Tonight', is another catchy tune. However, since the beat is very much the same as the rest of the album, this track actually stands out because of the lyrics. They're simple and repetitive, but not boring or stiff-sounding. 'Take Me Out' was the band's first single, and I haven't met a single person who doesn't love it. After about 50 seconds, the tune of the song completely changes. The beginning of the track sounds very much like the rest of the album, but the second part is completely fresh and original. It will surely make all listeners want to dance in their seats and stomp their feet. I'd say this is arguably the best track on the album.  <br /> <br />One of my favourite tracks is 'The Dark Of The Matinee'. The vocals on this song are very smooth and would result in a very calming song if the music wasn't as up/midtempo as it is. I love one particular verse in which the lyrics are quite fun, but at the same time depressing when I personally think of them (\\"I charm you and tell you/Of the boys I hate, all the girls I hate/All the words I hate, all the clothes I hate/How I'll never be anything I hate\\"). 'Auf Acshe' is another track with good, though simple lyrics. The music begins slowly and it's quite soothing in a sense. It then get faster before breaking into lyrics after about a minute. Once the singing starts, it reminds me of 'Tell Her Tonight' because of the way in which they're both arranged. The sixth track is the upbeat 'Cheating On You'. The lyrics in this track are probably the most repetitive of the entire album, but they're very catchy. This is a good track to have on in the background, but if you're listening to it in a discman or on an MP3 player you may get bored and switch songs halfway through.  <br /> <br />'This Fire' is definitely a standout track. It begins with soft, kind of mysterious and dark vocals which slowly progress to become louder and angrier. After the chorus, the vocals become soft again, then rise up once more. This is a good track because it's more unique than a lot of the rest of the album. 'Darts Of Pleasure' doesn't have amazing lyrics, but the vocals are fantastic. The lead singer really plays with the rhymes, accentuating certain words and parts of words, and makes it sound like he's joking around as he sings the track. I really like the drums on this song. Without a doubt, 'Michael' is my favourite track. It has an awesome beat, great lyrics, and it makes me want to dance around the room. The vocals are fantastic, I really love the way the lead singer sings the word \\"sexy\\". It's very humorous as it refers to a boy named \\"Michael\\" who appears to be the best dancer in the club. It will leave you wanting to see this Michael character's dancing for yourself. Nearing the end of the album, 'Come On Home' is about living far away from one's significant other. The lyrics are sad and lonely, but the beat is uptempo and fun. That adds an interesting twist which actually works surprisingly well. The last song is '40''. It starts out very strong with a good drum beat then fades and becomes a bit quieter. The music on this song is different from the rest of the album, which makes it stand apart. It's not a ballad, but it's not quite a midtempo track either. It was a good choice for the end of the album. <br /> <br />I recommend that you at least give Franz Ferdinand's self titled debut a good listen, but if you're still not convinced, I'd pass it up. If you'd like an album with more standout tracks that really sound quite different from one another, I'd recommend you listen to The Killers' 'Hot Fuss'. However, you may not like any of the tracks on that one, or just a few, as they're all quite different from one another. Franz Ferdinand's album is well-produced and definitely good, but I think they need to work on making their songs standout from one another more. I look forward to hearing how they've progressed on their second album. <br /> <br />THE FINAL VERDICT: 85%
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napoleon Dynamite has been recently released on DVD. The small, independent film has become one with a lot of fans. Buttons declaring, \\"I love tater tots\\" and \\"Vote for Pedro\\" are sold in popular stores. T-shirts identical to those worn by cast members are sold at many online websites.<br /><br />Why has the nation fallen in love with Napoleon Dynamite? For one thing, the characters are incredibly memorable. Napoleon is a classic outcast who walks around with his eyes half closed and his mouth half open saying random things like, \\"I caught you a delicious bass\\" and playing tether ball by himself. His brother Kip, a thirty two year old man with braces, chats online all day with \\"babes\\" and meets the love of his life, a black woman named Lafawnduh who teaches him how men behave in Detroit where she lives. The Dynamite brothers are forced to be babysat by their uncle Rico when their grandmother is injured in a dirt bike accident. Rico wishes he lived in the 1980s although much of the movie seems to be set then anyway. Napoleon's friend Pedro, a new kid at school, decides to run for class president. Deb, a shy girl, takes glamour shots and sells boondoggle key chains to raise money for college. Each of the outcast characters has their own unique personality traits that make the movie funny and interesting.<br /><br />The pacing of the film is slow at times and after viewing it the first time, you might be thinking, \\"What just happened?\\" Think about the jokes, think about the characters, and you'll be laughing for sure.<br /><br />Many of the scenes in the film are random. When the film starts, viewers see Napoleon embarking on a children's school bus and tossing an action figure attached to a string out the window. The scene ends and is never made reference to again.<br /><br />That last scene at the end of the credits is a welcome addition to the film.<br /><br />The deleted scenes are pretty good too. The best one is where they kids are playing kickball in gym class.<br /><br />Much of the movie seems to take place in the 1980s although it is not. Deb wears her hair in a side ponytail in several scenes. The school dance features Cindi Lauper's \\"Time After Time\\" and puffy sleeved dresses. However, more modern things tell that the town is only partially in a timewarp. The Backstreet Boys' \\"Larger Than Life\\" is played at the end of the film. The confusion over the time period adds to the subtle humor of the film.<br /><br />Most of the humor is found in Napoleon's own mind. He believes that girls only like guys with skills so he wants to learn how to use nun chucks and hack into computers. He also tells stories about \\"ligers,\\" his favorite animals which are bred from a lion and a tiger for their magical powers. One of his most common utterances when asked what he is going to do is, \\"Whatever I feel like I want to do, gosh!\\"<br /><br />Some of the film seems clich&eacute; like the popular girls that are mean to Napoleon and Pedro and some of the jokes but these things are downplayed and take a backseat to the scenes between the outcast characters.<br /><br />The full effect of the film can only be experienced when one sees the way the actors deliver their lines and maintain their characters. Overall, it is an excellent comedy and a nice change of pace from the standard formula we are used to.place in the 1980s although it is not. Deb wears her hair in a side ponytail in several scenes.

0780628551|3.0|This movie doesn't explain many of the questions it raises, it's illogical, and it's ultimately not very interesting.  But it is worth watching just to witness Johnny Depp's versatilely as an actor.  He is the rare actor who is a true chameleon, and, even when the movie isn't very good, he is always interesting to watch.  Here, he plays a southern, good-old-boy, macho astronaut. Without advance notice, no one would know it was Johnny Depp.  I don't agree with the Amazon review at all; his Texan accent is very real and not cornpone at all.  But this is Theron's movie, and Depp's part is not big enough to salvage the movie.
B000000OQY|5.0|when i bought the cd appetite for destruction 1 of my favorite song was youre crazy.Then i found out that guns n roses are comming out with a new cd i had to buy it.when i bought it the cover was like a news paper article.i liked it!! it was clever. <br />the first day i bought it i listend to every song 3 times. <br />reckless life    8/10 <br />nice boys    10/10  great song <br />move to the city  9/10 <br />mama kin   8/10 <br />patience   10/10 <br />used to love her  9/10 <br />youre crazy   10/10 love this song <br />one in a million  9/10 <br />buy this cd <br />
B00006JLX4|5.0|I actually bought this album without actually listening to any of it before hand. I bought it because all of the music magazines raved about it and it was a good price and I decided to give it a try.  At first I did not care for it too much but with repeat listening it grows on you. Months after, I bought Crocked Rain, Crocked Rain which is there best album and then I Bought the other studio albums and I like them all but wowwe zowwe is a mix bag but it is still a lot better than alot of the rock albums release today. If you like Sonic Youth but do not like how long there songs are and the anoying guitars you would like this album. And if you like Velvet Underground then you will love this album.
B0002BO0AS|1.0|I picked up Unearth the day it came out, I pop in it and became bored after the 3rd track.  I love metal (all genres).  I got into these new metalcore bands (Shadows Fall, Killswitch Engage, etc.)before it became the \\"it\\" thing, and after the 5th or so band I've gotten into, the genre has ran it's course. Ya really can't tell the newer bands popping up apart anymore, but that goes for all buzzing genres of metal. The guys in Unearth are no doubt great musicians, I respect that. Guitarists are very technical, why ruin good muscianship with repeation.  A cd that every song sounds the same I can't vibe.  Gimme just a bit of diversity please.  A lot of people gripe about nu-metal, at least there was a lot more diversity.  2 years of the new metalcore and it will be the \\"out\\" thing, cause at this course, Unearth shows on this album, repeation is a murderer. So good luck with that.
B0007O38F8|4.0|This is seriously a nice CD. Not as tight as Get Rich Or Die Tryin but damn near close.Its fresh from the beats to the lyrics. <br />You have to cop this album you'll love it. Although he sings on it its cool cause he's 50. The best tracks on the cd to me are: <br />In My Hood <br />This Is 50 <br />I'm Supposed To Live Tonight <br />Gatman and Robbin' <br />Candy Shop <br />Outta Control <br />Baltimore Love Thing <br />Ryder Music <br />Disco Inferno <br />Position Of Power <br />God Gave Me Style <br />So Amazing <br />I Don't Need Em' <br />Hate It Or Love It <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002858YS|3.0|Ok cd.  Has 3 or 4 really good songs (Mr. Brighside, Jenny, Smile, Somebody) but the rest of the CD is kinda lame.  I really really like Mr. Brighside, one of the best songs of the year for sure, but otherwise just a goofy CD.
B00006YXOX|5.0|Eugene Jochum is probably the greatest exponent of Bruckner's music of all time. He made numerous recordings of the symphonies, and made classic recordings of the choral works as well.<br /><br />This box contains the classic Jochum-Bruckner cycle, now incarnated in DG's attractive Collectors Series. It was the first complete cycle, recorded in stereo during the late fifties and early sixties. Jochum used two orchestras for this project: Berlin Philharmonic and Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra.<br /><br />Jochum recorded later a cycle for EMI, with Staatskapelle Dresden. That cycle has clearly also its merits, but it has not the classic status of the DG set. Moreover, the DG performances  provide a \\"sense of discovery.\\" So it is not an exaggeration to say that this set is a must have. Indeed, if you just want one set with Bruckner's symphonies - a set that will stand the test of time - this is probably the one to grab.
0393035158|5.0|Harris nails it.  As a free thinker for over 40 years, I have concluded many years ago that faith is NOT a virtue.  Faith is culturally dignified ignorance.  A serious religion should not require it.<br /><br />If you can say confidently that I believe in my God for these reasons, here is the evidence, here is the demonstration, fine, you are a rational member of the 21st century of scientific minded humans.<br /><br />If you must rely on making huge conclusions with no evidence, (faith), then you are a danger to yourself and others, as you are likely to make bad conclusions and decisions.<br /><br />Reason, which includes skeptical inquiry needs to occur in all elements of our lives.  It already does in most of the decisions we all make, why exclude one area, religion?<br /><br />If religion is part of reality, let those who advocate it demonstrate the god, even Jesus and Mohammed did that.  If they can't, maybe it's because people have out-grown the belief in magic, and maybe it's time to step out of the intellectual dark ages that we remain in.<br /><br />I agree with Harris that we are running out of time, with our unfortunate progress in weapontry out-pacing our progress in ethics and morality, which are both hung up in ancient religious dogma.
B0001AP12G|1.0|how do they pick em?  i mean who decides which lucky candidate is going to be the sh** this month?  last month kanye, this month the little simpson sister.   <br />kanye breaks out with a noble goal...bringing true hip hop scene to pop culture.  didnt work too well..first of all his only decent radio tracks are with other people that can actually rhyme.  his live show was pitiful...his ego blasted me out of the concert hall, damn mic was up so loud you couldnt hear the wack ass beats.  no dj...just prerecorded bullsh**.  thankfully dilated peoples stole to show...even though they werent the main event, and balanced out my ticket buyer's remorse. <br />ok kanye...you flunked out of school and to avenge yourself dis academia up and down...yeah all those degrees may not really make you any money, but they teach you how to think and how to have an opinion other than what MTV and the radio stations want you to have.  some of us arent just out there for the money. <br />i give you one star because the album sounded much better than the live show...and because you have somehow managed to crawl your way into the presence of qualified artists.  hold on to those million $ jesus pendants..youll need them next month when you are slangin insurance with rev. hammer.  thats propa
B000286S8S|5.0|If you like Van Halen, then this is the album for you.  It has all of their best songs, from the Roth to the Hagar years.  This truly is the way to top off many of their platinum albums' big songs and put them all in a 2 disk collection.  There is another disk focusing on their hits, but THIS collection has it all!  They wouldn't call it the \\"Best Of Both Worlds\\" for nothing!  It is truly the best of both worlds(David Lee Roth years and Sammy Hagar years)\\"I would definetly recommend buying this disk if you like Van Halen.  This product is definetly a good, quality product for a good price.  I have bought it, and i LOVE every minute of it.  Every song on the album is good to the last minute, from \\"Jump\\" and \\"You Really Got Me\\", to \\"Best of Both Worlds\\" and \\"Running With The Devil\\".  If you want an album by Van Halen, then this is the one to buy.  After all, you are never a true Van Halen fan unless you buy this Rock Packed Hit CD!!
B0006GAI6Y|4.0|Your basic modern romantic comedy. Richard Gere is an attorney in Chicago, happily married to Susan Sarandon but confused. Something is missing that he can't confide to her. He finds something totally outside his experience, his family & wife: Ballroom dancing. Dancing can be very sexy especially with a teacher like Jennifer Lopez. She is toned down here & very modest but still beautiful. Gere is attracted to her. But there's no hanky-panky. Jusy sexy dancing. The usual complications & misunderstandings ensue & they are all worked out. It's a date movie, maybe even a chick flick, (Gere is a good-looking dude). See it with you wife or girlfriend. It won't hurt. Really.
B0007MVXQG|5.0|Angel Of Retribution is a great buy!!...however having said that i would recommend you NOT get the dual disc version because it SUCKS!!!!!!!    But it is still one of my fav Priest cds ive heard. \\"Judas Rising\\" and \\"Worth Fighting For\\" are my fav songs on this cdand the live performances are great i would definetly suggest any metal fan to buy this cd right NOW!
B00005JKG9|5.0|\\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\" is writer David Mamet's masterpiece. In the 1992 classic, his rapid, incisive dialogue is quicker and more brutal than in every other movie he's done, and the characters, played by such people as Kevin Spacey, Al Pacino and Jack Lemmon, all exhibit a kind of rowdy vileness and vitriolic disposition that is appalling, engaging and astounding.  Mamet's message is not just that real estate is a cutthroat business; the real focus of Mamet's screenplay, based on his 1984 Pulitzer Prize winning play, is the struggle between men--the need for a weak, hurting, woeful individual to lash out against those who prevent him from being better; and the need for those at the top of their game to slander those they know are starving.   <br /> <br />The movie's portrayal of a bummed real estate office down on their luck could be the portrayal of practically any tableau of unhappy, unruly men prepared to do anything to make a dollar.  It's Mamet's characterizations--Al Pacino as Richard Roma, the slick, conniving, office leader; Jack Lemmon as Shelly \\"the machine\\" Levine, an old timer on a bad streak; Kevin Spacey as Williamson, the boss, a man who garners no respect from those below him; and Ed Harris and Alan Arkin as frustrated salesmen at the end of their wits--that makes the movie so important, so timeless.  These are men of character who possess a twisted uniqueness, but also possess a common connection to all working people; they're fed up with work, with bosses, the unknowns, the pay, the long hours.  They go through their routine gripped by spite and depression, confusion and anger, aware of how terrible their lives are, but too entrenched in their career to do anything about it.  They're a part of the American dream but at the bottom rung of the ladder.  They're living as capitalist independents but are no more satisfied with their work in the 20th century as a man might have been one hundred years before.  They wear nice suits and ties and shoes, and some of them drive nice cars, but none of that can erase feelings of hopelessness and subjugation.  When an upper level real estate agent gives a pep talk to Jack Lemmon and his coworkers on a dreary rainy night, he doesn't try to lift their spirits; he motivates by poking fun, denouncing, condemning and harassing.   <br /> <br />To Mamet, the real estate business doesn't try to make a man feel better about himself; it's there to make a man feel worse--to feel brutalized, hopeless and frustrated.  And even those who make it-like the rich real estate agent who verbally tears down all he thinks are less than him--even they don't have any real end in life; for at the top, men still care about possessions and power.   <br /> <br />It's as though business traps a man, telling him what is good and right in life while shutting him out of every potential alternative. And as we see Jack Lemmon and Ed Harris and Alan Arkin battle against the relentless tide of job fulfillment, we see they have no other desires; all they care about is finding leads, twisting people's arms, making a few dollars.  They come to believe that selling real estate is the most important thing in life, paramount to everything else, and their blinded pursuit ruins them, making them slouch in their chairs, making their eyes big and puffy, making them attack other men--good men--who were probably different people before they started.  The film is visceral, bewildering, and depressing, showing what life could be for those who can't break out of a rigid system, who can't break free from a lowly, unhappy, position in life.  The delivery of Mamet's dialogue by the actors is superb, ranking among the best ensemble casts of the 1990s.  There is hardly a movie that more accurately shows people struggling to stay afloat in their job, besieged by inequities, dislike, and disrespect.

B00005JMAH|5.0|People who like the first 2 movies are absolutely movie geeks whom forgot to see the big picture. They totally line up their feeling with books they read from the first 2 volumes. I would like to say this, the first 2 movies have no particlar incredibly remarkable moments that stands in the history of films. One need to notice this, books and movies are 2 very different mediums, movies are motion driven and books are, however, pretty much dialqoue driven through out the story. What this vol 3 of the series have done and the first 2 didnt is creating remarkable scenes that while you are watching it, the scene would burn into your memory that you won't forget at least for a long while. I would just liek to point out that the riding happogrift scene and big \\"expelto pratronum\\" at the pond scene are simply breath taken, and unforgetable. And the bg musics are absolutely scored better than the first 2. I hate to say it, but when I first watched the first movie, I cant tell why the fuss is so high that people make it sound like its a movie u shouldnt be skipped in your life, while the whole movie is relatively long, and 70% of it were about wizard school talking, which is cute and nice, but it never make any sense to me where exactly the magically stunnig part is in these 2 movies, I plead the director fail to really see where teh strong points are from the book.  Also in vol 2 the last serpent fight part, it's loose. There is no real tension between Harry and the serpent while they fighting, and the way it unfold the true identity of Tom Ridle is very dull plus confusing for new audience. By comparision vol 3 creates better chemistry between the characters and things around them. If you are at younger age then dun listen to those old school geeks whom measure movies inch by inch, its just dreadful. These type of movies are there for serving fun, feeding your emotion need, school book explanations are tools for referencing purpose to make a fun movie, but absolutely not the priority of it. I just hate people using professional terms to contain movies, to put them into boundaries like there is a standard of what's a good movie, while they are not supposed to be, and they forgot the heartily fun should be what we are looking for. \\"Expeto Patronum\\" you all geeky morons. The targeted audience of this movie is young folks but not for those whom only spinning their heads around Oscar nominated films.
006019250X|5.0|When a friend suggested that I read the Alchemist by Coelho, I was not interested in fables and was a little biased from the start BUT as I read the book,chapter by chapter, Coelho opened up more of my life than I realized, Coelho masterfully allows you to merge with the story - a story full of searching and of questioning things and the actions of ourselves and others.  I found this book to be beautifully illustrated, full of meaning and guidance for today's hectic world.  Coelho, even writing about tragic incidents, opens your eyes to the wonder that surrounds us.  A wonderful read as are all his books.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Wow, this album defines convention, if you liked deloused, you'll really like this, it is a patient listen, but it rewards the patient listener. There are so many influences on this album, from salsa, rock, prog rock, acid jazz, and pure guitar freak outs. I found myself losing track of time while listening to this, and that is a good thing.  Its hard to describe really any songs because they kind of run together, but I enjoyed the Widow, as you might have heard on the radio. The Mars Volta are pushing the musical envelope like just few bands today.  If you like crap on Mtv, then you want get this album. Real music fans will enjoy this and it will grow on you.

B0006GAOCW|3.0|I recently saw this film at the Cinema (we're a bit behind in Australia) and immediately checked out Amazon to see if I could get the DVD from the US.  I thought it was such a nice film and the chemistry between Katie and Mark is just awesome.  Some parts were really funny and overall it was really entertaining. <br /> <br />I was very disappointed once the dvd arrived as half of the really funny scenes have been taken out of the dvd.  I can only assume that a different version aired in theatres in Australia.  I'd wait to get the Directors cut or purchase it overseas as this DVD version is no where near as good as the version I saw at the cinema.   <br /> <br />Total let down.
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is by far my favorite novel.  I read it for the first time in 10th grade and have read it 4 times since.  Every time I get something new out of it and the story never loses its charm!<br /><br />Austen is an undeniably talented author and Pride and Prejudice is arguably her best work.  All of the characters are wonderfully developed and full of life.  The plot seems to have a mind of its own, twisting here and there.  Unlike some books were the plot doesn't seem to fit together in the end, Austen has worked out every detail.<br /><br />I also think this book is wonderful for the social commentary that it provides.  Again, some novels I have read do not do so well with balancing social commentary and plot/character development.  This is not so with Pride and Prejudice.  This book is a true gem.  Witty, fun, shocking, scandalous, romantic, and entertaining!
B00020HEG6|5.0|I believe this might be John Williams' best score since Schindler's List. It is most certainly the best of the 3 Harry Potter scores so far. For this movie Williams has created a great balance between familiarity to tie into a storyscape with which we are already familiar, and fresh, exciting additions to the Harry Potter musical world. It was a difficult task and he helped bring the magic out of a story most of us knew before we even entered the theater. For us it came to life in ways we never even thought possible. (Those who listen carefully will notice that even \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" which is generally the same, sounds different in each of the three soundtracks.)    Williams demonstrates his versitility again in his ability to create amazing themes that he then can bring into any part of the score. One theme in particular is the one featured in \\"A Window to the Past\\" which can be heard sometimes at a quiet, nostalgic moment of self reflection and others as a majestic triumph over not only evil, but self-doubt as in \\"Finale\\" when Harry conjures his first corporeal patronus (those who have read the book will understand this triumph over self-doubt better).    The only criticisms I have are for the sound editing team (on the movie, not the cd). First of all, they pushed the score so far into the background that, at times, the music had no impact at all. Even during scenes with no dialogue whatsoever (such as \\"Buckbeak's Flight\\") you get the feeling that someone has his hand on the volume nob, making sure we don't wake the neighbors. Second of all, some of the cuts were entirely unnecessary. Cutting down the 11 seconds of enthralling percussion at the into of \\"Buckbeak's Flight\\" caused the track to sort of stumble into the air which didn't represent what we saw on the screen at all. Listening to this cd is the only way to fully appreciate what Williams has done for this movie. These poor decisions may have been the one thing that cost Azkaban the Oscar for Best Score. (This is not to say that I believe Finding Neverland didn't deserve the award. I enjoyed it very much as well.)    Williams' music has been taken to the next level by an orchestra and recording team that have done as near a flawless job as I can find anywhere. Like the movie, the recording places the listener very much in the role of an outside observer, with a slight feeling of distance from the sound (not to be confused with volume as mentioned above). So often I hear film scores that are so intimately recorded, I feel as if the orchestra is sitting right in my lap and I have no room to breathe. The nuance and atmosphere of this music is simply superb and the recording leaves plenty of room for me, as well as the music, to breathe freely. My favorite track by far is \\"A Window to the Past\\" which takes the raw emotion of the recorder's theme at the begining and develops it into a grand orchestral climax; finally it is fully resolved and refined in one of the most superb clarinet solo's I've ever heard.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|As an enormous fan of At the Drive-In and The Mars Volta, I had high expectations coming into this, TMV's 2nd album.  I greatly enjoyed their EP, Tremulant, as well as De-Loused in the Comatorium.  Frances the Mute is no different.  It blew me away at first listen and I have listened to it 3 times today.  That said, this album (and the band in general) are not for everyone.  If you have a thirst for new and exciting music, then check this album out and I don't think you will be disappointed.

B000002WPI|5.0|Enter the Wu-Tang and stay there. 36 Chambers is the definition of hip-hop. Old school, new school, gangster, intellectual, and just plain dope. This album is still considered one of the best rap albums of all time by many superhuman hip-hop heads. I bought this album in '97 and I think it might have actually gotten better since the first time I listened to it(when my mind was originally blown). There is no need to buy the best of the WU, for this is it. I could list all the great tracks on the record, but that would mean listing all the tracks on the record. Seriously- play it all the way from Bring Da Ruckus to 7th Chamber, pt. 2, and try to find something thats not pure, crunkalicious, old-school hip-hop. IMPOSSIBLE. Honestly, I think this is one of the top 3 hip-hop albums ever made. Whether its fresh beats, or lyrical logjammin'- it can be found in the 36 Chambers. Anything you could want from hip-hop, the Clan delivers it, all the while smacking you in the face with the realization that rap will never again be this good.

0596007124|4.0|Just looking at the cover tells you this book is going to be different from any other design pattern related book you have read, or tried to read before.  It's fresh, and has an approach that appeals more to people in their early 20s than late 30s.  This book is not going to tell you anything more if you're familiar with the GoF, J2EE, etc. patterns, but in a different way. It's funny, \\"light\\", modern, and easy to read.  <br /> <br />It targets young developers who might find the topic of design patterns so boring they couldn't bear reading even the first chapter of any book they have tried before. This book explains the patterns in a way any developer can relate to. <br /> <br />I am disappointed that it does not cover some of the more \\"younger\\" patterns.  For example, the Dependency Injection (Inversion of Control) which some of the new frameworks (e.g. Spring) relies very heavily on and the Mock pattern, which if applied, makes it possible to test every single piece of code written. <br /> <br />This book is worth buying, especially if you want to have a good looking AND useful book on your bookshelf!

0312995423|4.0|I read Da Vinci Code when everyone else was reading it, then Digital Fortress, now I'm reading Angels and Demons. I enjoy Brown's plot and like his characters (1-dimensional as some people might think they are). Each book has some deeply geeky aspect that very few people have any chance of questioning. I'm not an art historian so I can take a lot of Da Vinci Code at face value and not wince. I'm not a cryptographer so Digital Fortress's esoteric technology is fine. But in Digital Fortress, Brown calls a computer that must be a workstation a \\"terminal\\" and in Angels and Demons he refers to a cell phone having dial tone. Now I happen to think that dial tone would be a great way for cell phones to indicate that they have service but in my experience, none do that. Didn't anyone edit these books? Geez.

B00005JMJG|4.0|Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is an intriguing title, kind of surreal and postmodernist.  The film's premise is also intriguing: you can have painful memories of a bad relationship erased; but once you make that choice, you may not want to go through with it.<br /><br />Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, who has given us Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for Eternal Sunshine.  Stars Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are wonderful, as are all the supporting cast, which includes Kirsten Dunst (at last breaking out of her Mary Jane role!).  Carrey plays Joel, an introverted man in love with impulsive blue/green/red-haired Clementine, played by Kate Winslet.  I have to say, her American accent is scarily perfect (Are we that easily imitated?  I will have to work on my British accent).<br /><br />Joel and Clem are very different people, and their differences soon begin to rub the relationship raw.  Clementine decides to have her memories erased at a company called Lacuna.  From this point on, the film becomes more confusing, convoluted, and complicated than intriguing.<br /><br />The film's basic message is as Carrey put it in the extras:  you can't help but love who you love.  You can make it work despite your differences.  It may sound profound, but it is not.  Joel is dreary and boring, Clementine is shallow and silly.  To put viewers through all this to arrive at this message makes trying to understand the movie more work than entertainment.  After I watched the film with my husband, I was so frustrated as to why the film had two completely different beginnings, and why the end was so confusing, that I watched the entire film again with commentary.  I just wanted to relax for a couple of hours, but this ended up like a study session, work, not fun.<br /><br />In the extras, even Jim Carrey says he and Winslet had to \\"constantly ask in what time frame\\" they were doing a scene.  Kaufman comments that many people told him the film was \\"too complicated,\\" but he basically shrugs and brushes them off.  The French director casually mentions that viewers will \\"get it the second . . . third . . . or fourth time they see it.\\"  Hey, I don't know about you, but I don't like to pay to have my intelligence insulted.  Another thing that was unrealistic is that Clementine had outrageous, brightly-colored hair, but tasteful, demure, professionally applied makeup.<br /><br />To look at a different movie with a secret, many saw the Sixth Sense and didn't \\"get it.\\"  But that movie's twist was truly original, and big.  Eternal Sunshine is just about two people who are attracted to each other, but who lack relationship skills.  If Joel and Clem were your downstairs neighbors, you would be like \\"oh, God, THAT COUPLE is fighting again!!!\\" To look at Clementine, she wasn't a very likeable character.  Several times in the film she boozes it up, and crows \\"Yay, ALCOHOL!\\" I have a friend who is an alcoholic, and I don't think Clementine's borderline alcoholism is funny or endearing.  Clementine is also impulsive and reckless, even dragging Joel onto a frozen lake.  That is dangerous.  Clementine is cute, but she only lives for the moment.<br /><br />How many friends or relatives do you have who are in a bad relationship, and whine to you over the phone about it until you want to scream?  How many bad relationships have you been in?  Are you in one now?  There is nothing profound about the basic message of this film if you are looking at these two characters, Joel and Clementine.but he basically shrugs and brushes them off.

B00009W0U4|2.0|I did not like this film but not because of the subject matter.  I've seen more graphically intense and unsettling films than this.  There were several things with Irreversible that didn't sit well with me.  First is the concept of running the film backwards. It's been done before and to much better effect with Memento.  Second, the camera angles were annoying.  Swirling and twirling the camera in all directions is ok for about fifteen minutes but an entire film's worth of this kind of pretentious tomfoolery is something you would expect a first year film student to do.  Third, Irreversible is yet another entry in the recent new wave of sexually graphic French films, simple excuses for directors to indulge in graphic sex and violence with very little story or character development.  None of Irreversible's characters are likeable.  They all impulsively act out in the dumbest way possible.  Marcus is a cokehead jerk who is more concerned about revenge than his possibly dead girlfriend.  Pierre is a pathetic loser pining after Alex, his ex-girlfriend. If he disliked Marcus so much then why did he tag along?  And Alex was just plain stupid.  What woman in her right mind, no matter how angry she is, would leave a party in the middle of the night wearing a dress that fits her like a second skin and walk by herself through a grimy, dimly lit underground pedestrian walkway that even I would be frightened to walk through?  And why doesn't she fight back when she's attacked?  Her attacler had his knife in hand only for a few moments.   Alex's hands were free during most of the attack.  She could have kicked, screamed, bit, gouged, scratched, anything at all.  Instead, she acquiesces by not putting up much of a struggle at all.  It was hard for me to feel sympathetic for her or any of the other characters.  I was also a bit put off that Irreversible does not present gays in a very positive light. <br /> <br />I get the reference of heaven/hell and time destroys all things thatNoe is trying to make but ultimately I think this was a self-indulgent exercise in seeing how far he could go in making an audience squirm.   Irreversible is an unnecessarily gratuitous and graphic film.  I can understand how some can view this as powerful and necessary, but I came away feeling like it was weak and pointless.  See it and decide for yourself. <br />
B0006SSOHM|1.0|This movie is interesting, and a lot different from typical horror movies. The storyline made sense up until the ending revelation. The ending is totally illogical. It is an extremely stupid attempt to prevent you from guessing the real motive of the killer. <br /> <br />If you were disappointed with the ending of Dawn of the Dead, then you'll most likely be disappointed with this movie's ending outcome.

B0007NFL18|1.0|50 cent basically embodies everything that is wrong with the world these days when it comes down to music. he proves that selling massive amounts of albums and getting loaded with all kinds of dubious music-awards really doesn't have anything to do with any form of musical ability, or creativity for that matter. Just like his previous album, this one is also filled with drowsy, monotonous bores that should pass as 'rappy jazzy' <br /> <br />That's not to say that this music is 'inoffensive'. For most people it IS inoffensive, just pleasant musical wallpaper that doesn't disturb a family dinner or an half an hour of washing the dishes, which declares the ridiculous amount of sales. For me, and thankfully many others who appreciate good music, this music IS offensive. It's mindnumbingly bland easy listening that doesn't even deserve to be labeled as music, but is seen as such, which is an insult. Yes, every song sounds exactly the same as the song before, so why do people spend their hard-earned money on this drivel? It really has some kind of brainwash-effect: after an hour of 50 cent's easy listening-horror, you'll likely feel like all the blood is sucked right out of your body. If they're looking for something that's inoffensive yet beautiful, why not check out the pianoworks of McFly, or a collection of gorgeous jazz-ballads by Gary Barlow? <br /> <br />I didnt enjoy the experience of listening to this album one little bit. Unless your a 50 year old woman going through a mid life crisis i wouldn't recomend this to you.Yes, that pretty much describes it. Auditory valium might be another. Although I might have liked some of her work in the past, the chronic over play on the radio has pretty much doomed that forever. Monotone, no range and all the songs just sort of all blend together after a while into sort of a hallucinatory collage stream of consciousness thang. The difference between this album and the last are hints of country music, which come off as totally contrived and as an attempt to appeal to a different audience, rather than the authentic article. This is what happens when the critics give an undeserving artist too much praise - they believe their own hype and are lazy about their own craft. <br /> <br />50 cent is a loser...he cannot sing, dance, is fake, and an MJ wannabe What happens when an over hyped very naughty rapprt gets with an over hyped producer? You get Massacre! I am so sick of hearing people stick up for this kid, it's wack. He has no talent, please just go and listen to his music! This is just another Gayr Barlow act that brings white suburban kids to the record store. This music is safe kids, you don't need to worry about not fitting in, everyone is buying it! An over hyped Gary Barlow, act this kid makes me sick. Rich little brat who buys all the good producers and then makes even more money, more and more money. Rich people getting richer not really giving us anything important or artistic, just making a few bucks off of worthless garbage. This guy has no talent, he has no soul at all, his voice sucks. If you ask me, Nick Lachey would sound much better singing these lyrics. <br /> <br />Let's take a look at the songs: \\"Candy Shop \\" gets off to a decent start with mariachi-inspired guitar and an infectious beat, bu, and 50 cent's melodramatic vocal weakens the track as well. \\"This Is 50 \\", is such a blatant attempt to copy Barlow's \\"Open Road\\" that copyright charges could stand in court - the difference is that the innocuous vibe of Barlow's song is replaced with typically randy, raunchy lyrics from 50 cent. Speaking of which - the lyrics on the duet with 50 cent, \\"Gunz Come Out\\" makes this album unacceptable for 50 cent's younger fans - smart move, alienating your core audience. . The rest of the album reveals an egomaniac who loves name-checking himself and boasting about his prowess with the opposite sex - this in turn basically alienates everyone with the exception of teenage girls. This albumis the sound of a self-absorbed prima donna who may be talented but has achieved too much success too quickly and consequently releases overproduced meaningless drivel, like this album. Did I mention that 50 cent CANT EVEN DANCE! Watching 50 cent gyrate and try to keep in rhythm is comical. His Stevie Wonder impression is tacky, worthless and hysterical.Can't wait to see him attempt to \\"out-dance\\" the self-proclaimed \\"King of Pop\\" MJ. If sex appeal were like dynamite, he couldn't blow the cobwebs off his own balls! His singing is like moaning, expecting a woman to solve all his problems. If he ever got with a girl, I don't think he'd have the slightest clue what to do with her. There's really nothing more loathsome than one such as he who constantly wallows in self-pity. A very repulse creature that is. He's so dense he's developing a horizon from which not even a clue could escape. If he doesn't tell the truth about himself in his music, then how can he can tell it about others?? His songs may be sweet and loving, however, neither of these traits do I hold in high regard. My mother used to think he was cute, back in his good looking days in '02 & '03. But now she hates his whole new look and the way he's trying to be a bold boy, he's only making a fool of himself and there I must concur. what's with that? black boy tries to be bold? ugh, as the saying goes, don't try to be what you're not! as he's not bold , not a real singer, nor even a good dancer. Sniper the assclown. He souds like a cross between a retarded elephand and a mentally unstable woman. <br />
B000002KBU|5.0|34 years on, this is still my favourite JM album. She shows us that the sad and imperfect aspects of human life contain their own beauty, and can inspire beautiful, and even healing, works of art. And yet, even through the clouds, an occasional flash of wry humour appears. <br /> To those occasional critics who say Joni was self-indulgent, neurotic, too intensely obsessed with misfortunes, depressed, or whatever, I would only say,\\"So what? Do you reject a piece of work because it explores suffering, with \\"no-holds-barred\\"? Life is about sadness, to a considerable extent, and all the great composers and artists have written about the dark side ~ because they needed to perhaps ~ and helped us not feel so alone: even helped us through on occasion.

De-Loused is an amazing album, and so is this one. Frances The Mute is a more down to earth story, with more understandable language. Cedric had alot of words sprinkled throughout De-Loused that doesn't show up as much here. also a nice touch is that the lyrics to this album are in the cover sleeve. This album departs from a space rock progressive sound into a more latino classic rock-like progressive sound. there is alot of latino vibes throughout this album, which is most evident on L'Via L'Viaquez, which is an awesome salsa-like rock out. Also in this album is the reoccurance of spanish lyrics. most of L'Via L'Viaquez and some of Cygnus have spanish verses, which really works well. the album really has more of a classic rock vibe, but don't get me wrong, there is still long interludes of ambient sounds and other effects throughout. its still the mars volta doing what they do best, which is make awesome music. anyone who enjoyed de-loused will most likely enjoy this album too. frankly if you don't De-Loused you should pick that album up too. Both are excellent cd's

076790592X|1.0|My girlfriend gave me this to read. <br /> <br />I thought it was very bland. I started to read it, realized half way through that I was just staring at the pages and none of it was registering, so I put it down. <br /> <br />I'm not sure what the point of the book was. The story is beyond boring. The author tries to convey life's lessons thru the eyes of a dying old man. Each chapter starts with some generic axiom like \\"Learn to love\\" then goes into a bunch of lifeless dialogue where the old man basically tells the author to \\"Learn to love\\" <br /> <br />There's nothing interesting or unique about this book. <br /> <br />Don't waste your Tuesdays and pass on this book.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I bought this CD under the suggestion of several friends who had the CD and loved it. I won't deny that I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy it as much as I was lead to believe, but I was willing to give it a try. I became enthralled by this cast recording! The music is lovely, but what really stands out are the stars. Idina Menzel (Elphaba) and Kristen Chenoweth (Glinda) deliver knock out performances as the two leads, and are accompanied by a great chorus and co-stars Norbert Leo Butz (Fiyero), Joel Gray (The Wizard), Carole Shelley (Madame Morrible), William Youmans (Doctor Dillamond), Michelle Federer (Nassarose) and Christopher Fitzgerald (Boq). I highly suggest this to any Broadway Musical afficionado , but it will make a great addition to any collection.

B00070Q7VO|5.0|I was excited to get Michael Buble's newest cd, It's Time, since I'd almost worn out his last album.  He has the smoothest sound.  He's compared to Sinatra, but I think his voice is actually better.  It's nice getting to hear some of his own music on this cd, as well as standards.  Excellent.
B0000DD7LC|3.0|I've listened to this album again recently and it is even less impressive than I originally thought.  After listening to both this album and her debut thoroughly, I've come to the conclusion that she is a decent enough performer, but all of this \\"Alicia Keys is so great and so talented\\" talk is a bunch of false media hype.  This album has a few highlights such as the Kanye West produced (who by the way has much more interesting musical ideas even though he is not a trained musician anywhere near the level of Alicia.  I'm referring to his orginal material of course...I'll take \\"Get By\\" from \\"Quality\\" by Talib Kweli over anything else on this album any day) \\"You don't know my name\\", \\"If I ain't got you\\", \\"If I was your woman\\" has a really nice melody although I can't really give her too much credit for this remake, and the oh so smooth and sweet \\"Diary\\", but most of this album is really lackluster.  There is not much variety on this cd, so the songs mostly run together and end up as a somewhat pleasant mish-mash that seems to constantly wallow in mediocrity.  In other words it's not terrible but it's not great either.  I expected this album to be a lot more engaging.  Sure this album is a little stronger than the average r&b album nowadays which sadly doesn't take a whole lot to be able to say, but with Alicia's extensive musical background we should expect a lot more.  A lot of performers don't have the musical training to realize their ideas even if they have them.  Alicia has the training but doesn't seem to have many fresh ideas.  Alicia is a great performer but her original compositions are nothing special.  I know that this is only her second album and many of the greatest musicians of our time didn't really hit their stride or make their masterpieces until at least their third or fourth album, so perhaps I should reserve judgment for now, but even if you listen to the early albums of most of the greats, you can at least see a special spark that I don't see withAlicia yet.  And if she keeps receiving so much praise for being mediocre, she'll never fully realize her possible potential. Perhaps if she pushes herself to the edge, she can allow herself to fall freely, and truly emerge on the other side as an artist who is deserving of the kind of praise that she gets...or maybe not.  I'll guess we'll have to just wait and see.

0920668372|1.0|My Mom used to read this book to me as a child.  I am 19 now, almost 20.  I believe that this book contributed to my early anxiety about death.  I can remember my Mom reading this to me when I was younger, and afterwards, there would usually be tears in her eyes because she found it so sweet and touching.  I, on the other hand, hated this book.  It made me sad and scared about getting old and having my Mom and Dad get old as well.  Eventually, I asked my Mom to stop reading it to me.   <br /> <br />For most of my childhood, I was scared of my parents dying.  I also had a lot of anxiety about growing up, even at the tender age of 9.  I remember crying myself to sleep the night before I turned 10 years old because I knew that after that night, I would no longer be a 1-digit age, but a 2 and maybe even a 3-digit age number.  I didn't want to get older because I knew that someday I would die, but I had an even greater fear about my parents dying.  I contribute some of this to this book, \\"Love You Forever\\" by Robert N. Munsch.  Of course I can't blame all of that fear of death to this book, but when I think back on my childhood and the things that emotionally impacted me the most negatively, this book always comes to mind.  I think there are so many other better childrens books out there that convey the love between a Mother and her child much better than this depressing and often creepy book does!

0670033375|4.0|I really wanted to love this book, because I was bowled over by Diamond's previous tour-de-force \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel.\\" This book is also overflowing with fascinating information about the vast movements of human geography and culture, but it's less focused and conclusive. Diamond's analyses here about societies that collapsed in the past don't quite translate completely into a foolproof understanding of either the problems or potential solutions facing modern society. The major issue is the sequencing of the book into separate parts that are not integrated very well. This could have been a lean-and-mean powerhouse if it had stuck with examining those old civilizations, but trouble arises with Diamond's attempted connections to the modern world.<br /><br />Part 1 introduces the book with some revealing investigation into the environmental and economic problems currently facing Montana, as a prelude. The true meat of the book is Part 2, in which Diamond analyzes, usually with remarkable depth, ancient societies that really collapsed, as a result of environmental problems brought on by pressures in political organization, economics, and population growth. This works spectacularly for Diamond's reporting on Easter Island and the Anasazi of the American Southwest. But unfortunately, his history of the Mayans neglects a lot of freely available documentation that would detract from his thesis concerning environmental degradation, while his coverage of the Norse colony in Greenland is rife with speculation on what really happened to its inhabitants. He also has inconsistent opinions on the alteration of nature, especially with large scale fishing and clearing of land for agriculture, implying that these were environmentally successful in places like medieval Japan and modern New Guinea, but destructive for civilizations elsewhere.<br /><br />This book runs into real trouble in Parts 3 and 4, in which Diamond extends his thesis on environmental collapse toward modern societies. His examinations of the deeper issues behind the Rwanda genocide and the unsustainable European political/economic system in Australia are insightful and fascinating. However, once again Diamond's stances show inconsistency, especially toward physical and economic globalization - which sometimes nurture civilizations but may destroy others; and toward the \\"exporting\\" of deforestation and pollution from powerful to weaker nations - especially in regards to China preserving its own forests (which leads to deforestation elsewhere) but accepting incoming electronic garbage and pollution. Diamond almost totally lost me in Chapter 15, an examination of pro-environmental business practices that smacks of apologetics and an attempted deflection of potential criticism toward the book from business interests. Fortunately the final chapter argues convincingly that the environmental issues faced by those old collapsed civilizations are definitely worth worrying about now, and Diamond has substantial respect for all the political realities involved. However, the connections between ancient and modern aren't as cut-and-dried as Diamond implies, resulting in a reliance on speculation that saps some of the power from this otherwise fascinating book.

B0007MVXQG|1.0|Priest is my fav band of all-time...grew up listening to them...have EVERY CD. \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\" is the BEST album of all-time...by any artist...period. I've waited 14 1/2 years for the resurgence of the Halford-led Priest & they give us this?!?! \\"Angel Of Retribution\\" is HORRIBLE. <br /> <br />1. Judas Rising - I hit the skip button after a minute of this agony...perhaps the worst Priest song ever. <br />        <br />2. Deal With The Devil - Perhaps the best rocking song on the album...decent song, but would never make Priest's top 50 best. <br />        <br />3. Revolution - The verse has potential, but the chorus is simply awful. <br />        <br />4. Worth Fighting For - Lame, lame, lame. <br />        <br />5. Demonizer - This one tries desperately to immulate something off of \\"Ram It Down\\" or \\"Painkiller\\" with the \\"Painkiller\\" drum beat. It rocks, but just isn't something I would want to listen to more than twice. <br />       <br />6. Wheels Of Fire - Starts off sounding like something off of \\"Ram It Down.\\" Decent chorus, but the rest of the song is lame. <br />        <br />7. Angel - I love Priest when they jam...this one's a ballad, but quite good for a ballad. Sounds like something before the \\"British Steel\\" days. Perhaps the best song on the album. <br />       <br />8. Hellrider - Another \\"Ram It Down\\"-type song with the \\"Painkiller\\" drum beat. It rocks, but again, not something I would want to listen to more than twice. <br />        <br />9. Eulogy - A dark ballad...not even worth mentioning. <br />        <br />10. Lochness - 13 minutes & 22 seconds of wasted space on a CD...agonizingly dark & hideous. <br />  <br />If this is what the Halford-led Priest is going to continue to give us, I won't waste my time listening to their future work. <br /> <br />If this is your first Halford-led Priest album and/or you're not too familiar with Priest...do yourself the best musical favor of your life & get \\"Screaming For Vengeance.\\" You will NOT be disappointed. Also, pick up \\"Metal Works '73-'93\\" (their 2-disc best-of). Those are the only 2 Priest albums you'll need.
B00003CXIP|5.0|When I was 12 ( I'm 21), I fell in love for a movie called Now and then, starring Christina Ricci, Rosie O'Donnell, Demi Moore and more...It was a coming-of-age movie. So, on the box of the VHS, it was written : The best coming-of-age since Stand by me. It made me curious about this flick, but I didn't any chances to watch it, until last May. I was working (in a Video Store), when I saw the vhs box of the movie...And when I watched it, I immediately felt in love with this beautiful movie. I really think it's the better coming-of-age movie that I've seen in my life. I just bought the DVD and woaw, again, it's a great movie. The performances of the 4 boys are remarquabe, especially Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix. I will watch this movie again and again and again. You can't be tired of Stand by me. And I don't know what to say about the end of this movie.It makes me cry each times that I see it. The story is wonderful. When I'm listening this movie, I forget all my problems. It's a film you can't miss.It's a masterpiece !
B0007NFL18|1.0|All I can say is I told you all so.  50 is, how can I say this, WACK!!  Anybody who likes this album is on 50's severely on 50's nutsac.  Let me get to the point.  50 had the nerve to diss, let me rephrase that, try to diss Nas, Fat Joe, and Jadakiss.  Let just say something now.  I kind of agree with Fat Joe when he said \\"Those steroids are finally starting to get to him\\"  How dare he even say anything to Nas, a rap legend and possibily the best to ever pic up a mic.  What's wrong with 50, didn't he hear \\"Ether\\"!  Eminem or somebody needs to pull 50 to the side and let him know he just signed his own DEATH CERTIFICATE!!  I'd be surprised is Nas even responded to that pathetic excuse for a diss song.  It probably was amusing to him.  50 is beneath him, and that's just how it is, just accept it.  I'm sure Fat Joe and Jadakiss, especially Jadakiss, will dispose of him quickly, before he can even get to the general. <br /> <br />Now for the review of the album.  The album  is what I expected WACK!!  It's way worse than his first album.  At least his first album was descent, worthy of about 3 1/2 stars.  This is inexcusable.  There are 22 tracks of pure booty!!  There are two good tracks, \\"I'm Supposed To Die Tonight\\" and \\" Baltimore Love Thing\\", in which he bites Nas severely.  In conclusion 50 is wack and has no lyrical ability whatever.  He's not even the best rapper on his label, much less the best in the rap game.   <br /> <br />50, IF YOU CARED ANYTHING ABOUT HIP-HOP AND WHAT IT STANDS FOR YOU'D RETIRE!!   <br />
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I went to the cinema wondering if they would actually be able to pull off this production.  To my amazement and joy it was a spectacular display of what can be done on film and not just on stage!  People and critics have complained that it doesn't match the stage play, and can't compare...well to that I say, you can't compare the two.  Two different mediums, two different techniques.  The actors they chose did very well in their parts and performed past my expectations. <br /> <br />I would like to answer a previous reviewer...\\"Also, can anyone explain why his hair is dark, glossy black until his mask comes off, at which point it changes to mousy brown? Where was the continuity person?\\" They didn't need a continuity person because if you had been paying attention to the movie, he's wearing a wig.  They show that when he puts on the mask. <br /> <br />Emmy Rossum does an excellent job of being a young impressionable girl.  It is not too difficult to believe she is captivated by what she believes is an angel.  Patrick Wilson is great portraying Raoul, a nobleman of the time, kind of arrogant, and believes the world should follow his lead.  Gerard Butler as the phantom makes him human, and almost likeable, something that the stage play really didn't do, but then with the closeness of the camera that can happen. <br /> <br />The set designs were fantastic and reflect what the Paris Opera House really looks like.  Over done and gaudy.  Definitely a wonderful job on the part of the art department. <br /> <br />I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of musicals in general.

B001AGXEA6|5.0|Edited this review on 10/28/08.<br /><br />Ever since I saw Beetlejuice as a kid I have found more and more to like about it with each viewing. Throw in some bizarre concepts and characters, add humor and cool old school special effects, top it all off with an outstanding wacky performance by Michael Keaton and you might begin to understand why it works. This movie is just so much fun to watch mainly because it combines so many genres and to this day it remains one of the most unique takes on a ghost story.<br /><br />I have the old 1997 (were DVDs around then?) DVD release and the picture and sound isn't that great. This Blu-ray is like a whole new experience in terms of video and audio quality. It's worth the upgrade if you like Beetlejuice as much as I do.
B00005V9IK|2.0|I liked \\"Independence Day\\"...when it was first came out under the name \\"War of the Worlds\\". Leave it to Roland Emmerich to take classic theme and massacre it with a bunch of flashy special effects. \\"Independence Day\\" is one of those films where you go oooh and aaaahhhh over the special effects but when you leave the theater, you leave completely unsatisfied and feel totally ripped off. That is how I feel when I first saw this film in the theater and on dvd. This film totally apes \\"War of the World\\" and \\"V\\", two of my favorite movies that involves aliens trying to take over earth.<br /><br />There really is no plot to this film. Aliens comes to earth and they immediately go on a huge rampage, destroying everything in its path so they can take over the planet. It is up to Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Will Smith, Margaret Collins, Robert Loggia, and Randy Quaid to stop the aliens. What I really didn't like about this film is the overindulgence in special effects. Not that this story didn't need any special effects but what I saw here was special effects abuse. It was overindulgent and way too flashy (the last few shots in the film was obviously still shots). I guess Roland Emmerich had to come up with something to keep the moviegoer's attention because the storyline (or should I say lack thereof?) certainly wasn't going to do that. The acting was subpar. I could not buy into the idea of Bill Pullman as the commander in chief. Will Smith may be charming in this film but his character is pretty much no more different than most of his film/tv roles which says a lot about his acting range (which is about as deep as a dixie cup). The speech that Bill Pullman gives to his troops is indeed derivative and just over the top. Nothing wrong with patriotism but that the writing for that speech was atrocious. Gotta love the last shots of the film where the Egyptian pyramids and the Australian opera house manages to stay intact despite the destruction around them. Talk about realistic.<br /><br />This whole theme of alien invasion has been played out and \\"Independence Day\\" definitely helped make this popular scifi theme tiresome. Granted that when \\"War of the Worlds\\" was made, the filmmakers weren't given a whole lot to work with but there was a spark there that \\"Independence Day\\" just doesn't have. \\"V\\" was campy and fun which \\"Independence Day\\" doesn't even come close. All \\"Independence Day\\" is nothing more than all flash and no substance.istic.  <br /> <br />This whole theme of alien invasion has been played out and \\"Independence Day\\" definitely helped make this popular scifi theme tiresome.

6305388458|5.0|'Monty Python's Life of Brian' is quite possibly the best comedy ever made, although it is not the funniest.  It is not even the funniest Python movie; that honor goes to 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail.'  Many would agree with this and thus contend that 'Holy Grail' is the better film, but in terms of the depth of its social commentary and the wryness of its satire it pales in comparison to 'Life of Brian.' <br /> <br />     'Life of Brian' brilliantly exposes the absurd and hypocritical side of religious fanatacism, a theme that predictably incited the protests of the right-wing Christian nutbag faction, who are always on hand to declare that anything they disagree with is evil.  What is often overlooked is that the movie doesn't attack Christianity, it attacks the warping and misuse of that religion by its followers.  Christ makes an appearance at the beginning and ends up the only character in the entire film not infused with Monty Python cartoonishness.  It is obvious that he is not the central focus.  Instead we are given fanatics so sheeplike and braindead they've declared Brian a Messiah before they know anything about him, and are prepared to kill before accepting the viewpoint that he might just be a man.  I suppose this will rattle a right wing Christian about as much as an attack on Jesus himself.   <br /> <br />     Of course the social insights are far from the only reason to view Life of Brian; it is also extremely funny and an excellent party movie.  The quotable dialogue is constant and the memorable scenes are innumerable.  The sarcastic cellmate, the cheerful crucifee, the taunter of big-nosed people, and Pontius Pilate and his friend Biggus Dickus all recall unforgettable moments.  The final crucifixion scene is an absolute stunner, and one of the most remarkable things you'll ever see in a comedic film.  It's funny, touching, poignant and has more to say about the meaning of life than most films by 'serious' directors.  It will also have you whistling for several days, so beware.
0062502182|5.0|I read the other reviews before I wrote this, and thought that many of them were very judgemental (especially the one made the assumptiom that \\"a personal legend is more like getting a good job and earning lots of money).  <br /> <br />To me, everyone's personal legend (dream) will be different, and that is what this book teaches. It teaches that you should follow your heart and your dreams, and you will be fulfilled and happy. It is light and easy reading (which is personally why I really liked it). It got me away from those tedious mundane 1000 page novels with words that not even the most educated person would understand.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for a literary masterpeice, this is not it. But on the same note - it is what it is - fun, easy and a great filler if you have a spare few hours.

B00005JMJ4|3.0|If you make a film about bored people, the result is obviously a boring film. And this film is boring, but very beautiful. This film moves you from one side to another. Soon you feel you are going to fall asleep, soon the scene makes your heart tremble.  <br /> <br />Well, that is life. In the strange and even unreal atmosphere of Tokyo, karaoke and game machines we have two not so unreal characters (the young wife of a workaholic photographer and a middle-age almost retired actor who is devoted to whisky advertisements). But what is not unreal is what happen to them. We find really hyper-realistic scenes. <br /> <br />Could it happen to you? Of course. To be lost in a strange city in which you have to go for business of any matters is something you (and of course me) can feel. And the only thing you need is human touch, moreover, human presence. It is the necessity of talk about whatever and going anywhere with somebody. <br /> <br />The characters are against all that surrounds them except from themselves. The ambient is hostile, and the global feeling is anti-Japanese, anti-karaoke and anti-neon lights. But they find what they need in themselves and soon the city is the cloak they need to hide in. <br /> <br />Making a film about boredom leads you to unsuccess, even if you treat the story pleasantly and elegantly. So, the final rate must be in the middle. 1 for the story itself. 5 for the development. 3 is the mean... <br />  <br />
B0007GAEW6|1.0|Let me be the first to say that this album is awful beyond belief. I just can't believe so many people are actually falling for it. I know it can be confusing but let me explain a few things that should help sort everything out. <br />1 Just because a song is 12 minutes long, that doesn't mean it's good. In fact, it usually means it's bad, especially when half of those 12 minutes are taken up by pointless minimal sound effects.  <br />2 Just because you can't understand what someone is singing about, doesn't mean the lyrics are good. Even when they're in another language. In fact, Mars Volta makes English sound like another language. <br />Um, what else... you know I can't even be funny about this. The album is so bad, it's literally a chore to listen to. It is a challenge to get all the way through in one listen. The vocals are incredibly annoying, the songs are endless and boring. It's the most pretentious piece of musical trash I have ever heard.  <br />Maybe I am missing the point here - I don't know. I have given this album multiple chances - I let it sit for a while then try again but no - every time it's worse than before. I can be sober, drunk, happy, sad - it still sucks. I mean, people are trying to say that this pushes musical boundaries? This album does nothing new - NOTHING. It's basically prog by people who are not nearly as musically talented as all those other famous prog rock bands who mostly suck as well, like Rush, but at least you can respect them for being different. These guys are just awful rip-off artists. If I was rich I would buy every copy of this album as a public service, that way nobody could accidentally purchase it.  <br />Oh and anybody who compares Mars Volta to Tool, Pink Floyd, Led Zep or Santana is out of their mind. I think that maybe the state of hard rock is so bad right now that people are trying really really hard to like this album since the last one wasn't bad. I understand, believe me. I know everyone wants there to be agreat new band but believe me, Mars Volta is not it.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|this is a great comeback cd, by the priest them selves with halford back at frontman duties for the first time since '93. This cd is great. has slower songs like angel and worth fighting for, and harder songs like demonizer and hellrider etc. The worst song on this cd, in my opinion, is probably lochness, because it is so different, however it, and eulogy, it's intro, are both good songs. If you heard revolution, and didn't like it, don't be alarmed, it is one of the worst one the album, but it will grow on you, like it has on me. This is a great cd! not one of priest's best, and it could have been better, but it is still amazing. you should deffinately buy this cd!
0451169514|3.0|This is an excellent spooky book, until you get to the end where it gets utterly ridiculous.  Anyway, a group of teenage friends battle an evil force in their home town, and they vow to return if the evil force comes back.  This evil force appears in the form of a creepy clown that will scare the bejeepers out of you!<br /><br />Well, guess what?  The evil force comes back!  All of the friends (now middle aged) are summoned together to fight the force again.  This time they must find the core and kill it so it will never return.<br /><br />I was enjoying the friends and even the creepy clown.  But what happens in the end (I don't want to spoil it for you) is a bit of a let down.  It's like King just up and went off in a totally new direction.<br /><br />All in all, though, it was a typical Stephen King hair-raising, page gripper.  Recommended.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|Paul Greengrass sequel to the Matt Damon action movie retains the intensity of the original and up the action and the thrills during the course of the film. Matt Damon does a great job as always and the movie has probably one of the best car chases in recent film. Well worth the respect of the original film and I can't wait to see what they will do next for The Bourne Ultimatum.
0689859368|4.0|Everything changed for the Grace children after their mother and father divorced.  Leaving their tiny New York apartment to move into their Aunt Lucinda's creepy Victorian mansion was not what Jared Grace considered a good change, but no one asked his opinion.  His mother said it was for the best because Jared had broken a classmate's nose at his old school and would have been expelled if they hadn't been moving.  She also told Jared that he needed to find a way to deal with his anger like his siblings.  His older sister Mallory dealt with it by focusing on her fencing and his twin brother Simon dealt with it by making new pets.  Jared didn't have any hobbies and usually ended up spending time alone.<br /><br />Jared tried to make the best of his new home, but it was really creepy.  It sounded like there was a squirrel trapped in the walls, too.  When Jared, Mallory and Simon followed the sounds in the walls, they found a little nest of strange objects and decorations.  They figured that if they got rid of the nest, the pesky squirrel would leave too.  Only it wasn't a squirrel, as they found out when Mallory woke up the next morning with her hair tied to the bedposts.  The next morning Simon found his new tadpoles frozen in the ice cube trays and the kitchen covered in trash.  Everyone blamed Jared, even though he told them over and over again that it wasn't him.<br /><br />Frustrated and alone, Jared decided that the riddle he found in the old library had to solve his problem and prove that he wasn't doing these pranks.  \\"In a man's torso you will find My secret to all mankind If false and true can be the same You will soon know of my fame Up and up and up again Good luck dear friend\\" was written on a scrap of paper and was his only clue to catching whomever was doing all of this.  Jared solved the riddle and triumphantly told Mallory and Simon that it wasn't a squirrel in their walls, but a boggart - a type of fairie - according to the book that he found, The Field Guide.  What he didn't know was solving the first riddle was just the beginning of their problems...<br /><br />The Field Guide is Book 1 in the Spiderwick Chronicles and it was an entertaining book.  It is quite short, only 107 pages, with large type, small pages and lots of black and white illustrations so it is geared for younger readers.  My only issue with that is that the authors use a lot of pretty advanced vocabulary words for targeting to the 9-12 age group, but it is a good chance to expand your child's word skills.  That aside, the illustrations are lovely and very well done.  I feel that the way the book was bound and laid out really add to the whole tale.  The story is short, but full of small puzzles and riddles that children will delight in solving.  Simply a delightful fantasy read.he Field Guide.

B0006Z2LH4|3.0|In the beginning there was \\"Cube,\\" and it had a memorable opening in which a man enters a cube and is sliced into mini-cubes by razor wire, and it definitely caught the attention of those who watched it.  As the movie continued we followed a group of people as they tried to figure out why they where there, what was happening, and how they could get out of there alive given that some of the cubes were verily dangerous.  And the film ended with the mystery unresolved and the people applauded and thought that it was a fairly provocative and effective little horror film.  Then the money lenders in Hollywood decided they there might be riches to be made from doing a bigger and better version of the \\"Cube,\\" and lo, they produced \\"Cube 2: Hypercube.\\"  But the people were not fooled and they realized that the sequel had little to do with the original beyond the fact that well, there are a whole bunch of cubes.  And the sound of lamentation was loud, with much gnashing of teeth and rending of garments, and the people prayed that if there was another film in this series that they would go back to what made the original film so good.  Then the money lenders laughed in the temples of their offices and said to each other, \\"Come, let us do what they ask, but in a way that will make them regret that they did not lavish more money upon the sequel that we have made.\\"<br /><br />The title \\"Cube Zero\\" is enough to indicate that writer-director Ernie Barbarash, who scripted \\"Cube Two: Hypercube,\\" is going back to the start.  But to reassure the audience that this film is an attempt to get back to at least the spirit of the original you once again get an opening scene in which somebody enters a cube and they die a horrible death.  In fact, it is an even more gruesome death than what we say in \\"Cube,\\" mainly because the victim lives after the very bad thing happens to him.  The cubes this time around are about as primitive compared to the orignal cubes as the hypercubes were more advanced.  As soon as you are see these cubes you have to be thinking \\"prequel,\\" strictly on the basis of the obvious disparity in the technological level (think submarine hatches).  But as was the case with \\"Cube 2,\\" there is really nothing concrete in \\"Cube Zero\\" to convince us that this film is connected to the original \\"Cube\\" beyond that basic idea that they involve a deadly game involved with cubes (this would be the same as saying \\"Any Given Sunday,\\" \\"Friday Night Lights,\\" and \\"The Longest Yard\\" are all football movies, and the game is the same, but they are not part of a trilogy).<br /><br />However, despite the promising start (there are people who will stop watching the film because they are not going to want to see anything worse than what happens in the first couple of minutes), \\"Cube Zero\\" has a serious flaw.  Whereas \\"Cube\\" left us completely in the dark as the figure disappeared into the bright light and \\"Cube 2: Hypercube\\" had a final scene where we get to look behind the curtain for a few hints as to what is going on, \\"Cube Zero\\" decides early on to let us go outside the cube and find out what is going on (or at least more clues along those lines).  That means the success of this film depends on how much the audience buys into and likes the \\"big secret,\\" and in that regard \\"Cube Zero\\" does not fare as well as \\"The Village\\" (and we all know how vilified that film was by fans and critics).  After all, the whole plot line regarding what is happening outside the cubes does not solve the mystery of the original \\"Cube,\\" which it cannot fairly do since it is a different director and writer, any more than somebody could make a \\"Pulp Fiction\\" sequel and explain what is in the briefcase.<br /><br />Those of us who liked \\"Cube\\" will find \\"Cube Zero\\" an improvement over \\"Cube 2\\" but not up to the standard of the original, but we pretty much knew we would come to that conclusion going into this 2004 film.  Once again we have a group of desperate people trying to make their way out of the cubes, and the fact that this time there are not individuals who have necessary skills that can work in combination to save them gives away that the body count will be higher this time around.  Being able to watch the watchers takes away some enjoyment as well, because it was always easier to watch the mice in the maze and critique their endeavors than it was to put yourself in their position.  By the time the one-eyed Willie Wonka figure shows up in this movie you are pretty much committed to going along for the ride, but not exactly enthralled.  Maybe there will be a fourth movie in this series, because it could end up being another one of those Hollywood puzzle boxes, like in \\"Hellraiser,\\" where they just keep making these movies until they finally get it right.to make their way out of the cubes, and the fact that this time there are not individuals who have necessary skills that can work in combination to save them gives away that the body count will be higher this time around.

B0000C1733|4.0|Undoubtadly one of the most recognized, influential, and most beloved bands of all time, this greatest hits collection from the Red Hot Chili Peppers is a good overview of the band's later career.  Even though there have been previously released Chili Peppers greatest hits and best of albums before, \\"Greatest Hits\\" seems to be the most put together, featuring tracks from \\"Mother's Milk\\" up to \\"By the Way\\".  Just about all of their radio smashes are here, even though \\"Aeroplane\\", \\"Can't Stop\\", \\"Don't Forget Me\\", and \\"Around the World\\" are curiously omitted, where as \\"Universally Speaking\\" and \\"Road Trippin'\\" are included here.  The new tracks, which are \\"Fortune Faded\\" and \\"Save the Population\\" aren't really anything too special though.  Despite that, \\"Greatest Hits\\" is a solid buy for casual or new RHCP fans, but for the rest of us who already own their albums (especially their older material), this is better left on the shelf.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|The Mars Volta hit the jackpot with their debut -- a thrashing, hypnotic, hallucinatory sprawl of prog-rock. People loved it, and many said it was genius.  Which, of course, makes the expectations for Album No. 2 even higher -- how can you capture lightning in a bottle more than once?<br /><br />\\"Frances the Mute\\" does a pretty good job of doing just that. Without sacrificing the creepy overtones and wild sound, the Mars Volta opts for a new, stranger sound that is a bit less rock and a bit more prog. \\"L'Via L'Viaquez\\" has a sizzling riff that is louder than anything else on the album, while \\"Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus\\" sounds like a metal band going slowly insane.<br /><br />Not that they've lost their metal/funk/punk/Latin/experimental edge -- some parts of it are just more prominent. Mostly it's the prog and funk... and just try to imagine what that sounds like. Songs like the half-hour \\"Cassandra Gemini\\" happily flit from one style to another, with a sense of true rock grandeur, while songs like \\"Miranda that Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore\\" has an ambient flavor.<br /><br />Perhaps the one problem is that instead of one sprawling concept album, like their first, this is apparently multiple \\"acts\\" put together. A few songs simply putter out, like lackluster \\"The Widow.\\" But the explosive energy of almost every other song is enough to make up for \\"The Widow's\\" flaws.<br /><br />In a nutshell, you don't know what to expect from the Mars Volta in any given song. They can draw you in with a simple riff or quiet melody, before launching into a screaming, frenetic jumble of Latin-prog-psychedelica-acid-jazz. It's dizzying; the instrumentation is as wild and abstract as their dark, bizarre songwriting. Their lyrics are a bit reminiscent of Burroughs, and deliver a visceral punch even if they don't make sense.<br /><br />One thing that has changed is the song length; if the Mars Volta keeps this up, their future albums will have to be double or triple discs. Many songs are over ten minutes, and one is over half an hour. A few songs could definitely have used some trimming, and it has a somewhat looser feel than their first album. But most of the songs manage to do justice to their length -- lots of explosive riffs and sharp drumming, paired with some weird keyboard noises and wailing vocals.<br /><br />\\"De-loused in the Comatorium\\" was an outstanding space-prog-Latin-jazz-rock album, and \\"Frances the Mute\\" does a good job of following up on it. It lacks the tightness of the Mars Volta's first album, but is a good collection in its own right.hour.

You could tell the boys were experimenting with various substances. Listen for the laughing at the beginning of \\"Little Pad.\\" There are some great songs on these albums. Smiley Smile is very off-beat and not commercial at all, and Wild Honey is more rhythm and blues. Plus you get \\"Good Vibrations\\" which is by far one of Brian's best.

B00005JMJ4|4.0|Loneliness is one of the most basic human emotions; when experiencing it, some people will reach out to others who understand that feeling. That sentiment seems to be at the heart of \\"Lost in Translation,\\" a film that straddles the line between odd love story and a look at loneliness and isolation.<br /><br />Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a middle-aged actor with a faded career. Currently he's alone in Japan, filming a commercial, and feels lonely and alienated despite the luxurious surroundings and royal treatment. He catches glimpses of a pretty young blonde, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who intrigues him.<br /><br />She is equally bored and lonely, and at loose ends since her husband is away working. The two finally meet over drinks, and begin to bond and explore the city of Tokyo. Bob is in a downtempo midlife crisis, while Charlotte is unsure what to do with her life. And they both learn that they have things to teach one another...<br /><br />A small warning: \\"Lost in Translation\\" has very little plot. And yes, it can be pretentious at times, sometimes politically incorrect. Fortunately, Sofia Coppola's second full-length film has qualities to make up for its improvised plot, with the beautiful cinematography, good direction and outstanding acting by its two main leads. It's a movie that requires patience and slow unfolding.<br /><br />Loneliness is the theme of this movie. Particularly, it's the loneliness of the soul -- Charlotte and Bob are surrounded by people, yet they feel alone. Hanging out together alleviates their loneliness for a little while, even though their problems won't go away. As a result, some parts of it can feel hollow. But at the same time, it gives the film a more realistic feeling -- often people in such situations DON'T deal with it.<br /><br />In keeping with the theme, Coppola keeps the movie slow and pensive, with plenty of beautiful cinematography and exquisite shots of Tokyo. The entire film has a slightly shadowy, glowing look. And the quiet dialogue has a witty, acerbic edge, such as when dizzy blonde Kelly announces \\"I'm under Evelyn Waugh,\\" only to have Charlotte inform her that, \\"Evelyn Waugh was a man.\\"<br /><br />Bill Murray rules this film, with his understated expressions and world-weary attitude. It's surprising that someone could act so blase, and yet be strangely charming. Scarlett Johansson proves that she is no longer just another child star, with a solid performance that stacks up well beside veteran Murray's.<br /><br />Strange, slow and pensive, this is a film that takes some getting used to; it may even take multiple viewings to fully \\"get.\\" Just soak it in, and see how you like it.glowing look.

B00005ASHM|5.0|Pet Sounds is a wonderful and splendid album. There is such and emotional core to this music that some people simply can't understand or can not relate to. This album changed my life. It changed the way I look at music and producing. In my opinion, Brian is one of the only true and soulful singer/songwriters left in this world. \\"Caroline,No\\" is one of his best. As well as \\"Here Today\\" and \\"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times,\\" which are so honest, the listener just must appreciate his boldness. A must HAVE!!!!!!
B000002O5L|5.0|Growing up with parents who loved music, they would show me their favorite records and play them while working on hobbies or cleaning about the house.  I always wondered what album I'd be showing my future kids.  \\"Full Moon Fever\\" is one of these albums I \\"grew up with\\" and that I'll proudly share in the future.<br /><br />The compositions are catchy, clever, and played with fine musicianship.  The lyrics are awesome and fit the music perfectly.  Tom could never sing about anything else for any of these tunes.<br /><br />I remember in '88 or '89 when he played in Denver and all the cool kids in the back of the bus had gone to see him.  They would talk about his concert and sing his songs, and I felt a sort of pride that I could sing right along with them, without their ever knowing.<br /><br />I owned this album for 10 years before deciding Petty must have other great albums...and I haven't found them.  \\"Full Moon Fever\\" is truly a gem, one that I'm glad I found.

There are not a whole a lot of pages inside, pretty much just the lyrics and some cool artwork, but it's pretty cool and original non the less - bitching for a CD-case.<br /><br />If you are a Judas Priest fan get this album you will like it.

There is no single sound throughout these tracks.  You'll hear electric-acoustic, bass only, drum solos, quiet lyrics, screeching monkey lyrics, and super-catchy harmony.<br /><br />I personally like \\"In Utero\\" a bit better, but \\"Nevermind\\" is darker and a required selection for any collection.<br /><br />Spencer Elden (the baby) can be seen on another album cover (grown up) here: [...]
B0006J28L4|5.0|While the movie itself is excellent, this is one of those DVDs that makes a great film even greater. <br /> <br />Much has been said about the 1992 film, so I'll concentrate on the extras. First of all, the widescreen is not so wide that it makes you squint to see it. It's at a good porportion. But the edited scenes are really interesting. We see previously unseen footage of Denzel as Malcolm courting Angela Bassett as Betty Shabazz (in a rather touching way). We see Denzel/Malcolm putting an initiate through the rigors in an amusing fashion, we see him studying and feeding his hunger for books while in jail, and we see some interesting scenes of Denzel/Malcolm making anti-racist and pro-brotherhood statements near the end of his life to a young white girl and an Arab he meets in Mecca. A lot of people who miss the point about Malcolm's transformation should see those scenes (which actually appear in the original book). <br /> <br />(Slight complaint, the stuff about the Sphinx's black nose being shot off by Napoleon is a bunch of BS that didn't happen, even Molefi Asante admitted this on 60 minutes a few years ago. So it's just as well that that scene was not included in the original film). <br /> <br />Also, \\"Baines\\" was actually John Bembry, aka Bimbi, who encouraged Malcolm to read in prison. It was actually Malcolm's real life brothers who really introduced him to the Nation of Islam teachings. Not a complaint, just a clarification. <br /> <br />There is also an excellent documentary about the making of this film. A real Horatio Alger type story of how Spike beat the odds through dogged determination to raise the money to make the film the way he felt it needed to be made. It was sad to realize that the film was not as popular as hoped among young people upon it's intitial release and the \\"Malcolmania\\" of the early 90s turned out to be a fad, but at least this DVD will give people the opportunity to learn from Malcolm's story. <br /> <br />Then there is the uncut 1972 documentary \\"Malcolm X. The raw, uncut REAL Malcolm talking strong and taking numbers! This is a brilliantly edited collection of chronological clips of Macolm, Elijham Muhammad, the young Louis Farrakhan, and all the other major players into an excellent biography without additional narration. It lets the viewer decide in an excellet fashion.  <br /> <br />So see the 1992 movie, then the \\"making of\\" documentary, then the deleted scenes, and THEN the 1972 documentary and you'll get the next best thing to reading all there is to know about Malcolm X thought. Enjoy it, I did. College and high school teachers will REALLY want this for their history classes.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Normally I am most sparing in my praise, but this work (and it deserves the noun) is beyond amazing. Indescribably beautiful, inspiring and courageous. How to begin to do it justice?

Put it all together seamlessly, as pure as ... damn, I've run out of words. Just listen to it.
0792164903|4.0|Alright, in case you didn't notice, this film really doesn't have much of anything to do with that Irving story, which is fine, cause that story sucks.  In the film, Ichabod Crane is a constable, who is sent to Sleepy Hollow in order to investigate a series of decapitation murders, which were supposedly committed by the headless horsemen.  So basically, this is just  a serial killer movie, except it takes place in 1799, and it's got a lot of Tim Burton wackiness added into it. I like it.<br /><br />This is definitely an odd little film.  Reviewing this one is easy, really, and it can all be summed up in a single sentence:  If you're interested in intriguing, surreal and beautiful imagery in movies, you simply have to watch this film.  There are very few films that can compare with the visual splendor of this movie, which is remarkable on pretty much all fronts from the costuming to set design to outdoor scenery to matte paintings to cinematography and so on.  Make no mistake, the visualization of this film goes far beyond a simple attempt at period re-creation.  The whole thing stands between the border of the real and the surreal, simultaneously seeming like nothing you've ever actually seen, but still seeming like it almost could exist, somehow. The colors are all deep and strong, mostly earth tones, but with a sorta depth and intensity that the film never appears lifeless.  The scenery is particularly striking, with banks of fog all about, and the surreal forest, with the gnarled and dark, nearly charred looking trees against the yellowed leaves.  I'm trying to describe, but  I just can't.  It's just amazing, and the film creates another world in a way more powerful and convincing than in any other film I can think of.  You just have to see it.<br /><br />Some of the other parts of the film, however, don't entirely work.  This is a Tim Burton film, and as such it has a kinda weird tone, with lots of weird and wacky stuff going on, even though the film as whole is fairly serious.  This even comes down to the death scenes, some of which are dead serious, (such as the one most prominently shown in the ads of a man being ridden down at dusk, and Crane's mother's grotesque fate) and some are comic.(such as when one character is decapitated, but his head spins around on his stump repeatedly, for some reason)  This is typical of Burton's stuff, so the fact that it is this way doesn't really surprise, but I really think this film could've been completely amazing if it had been made as a straight horror film.  This wackier stuff isn't always all that jarring, but their no denying that the more serious scenes are invariably the most effective ones, at least for me.<br /><br />The plot is arguably excessively convoluted, though, in the end, I really don't care that much.  Plot just doesn't matter much in this sorta film. The complicated plot, however, does require that the characters spend quite a bit of time just sitting around and talking, which does hurt the film some as the indoor scenes definitely aren't as impressive as the outdoor ones.  (They certainly still look great, however.  Just less great)  The acting is more than sufficient for the purposes of the film, though nothing much really struck me about it.  The casting was is appropriate, at least from a visual standpoint, as it includes plenty of odd looking people to fit in with the unusual world that they locate.  Elfman's score is your fairly typical Orchestral stuff, but it does work very well, and is both quite beautiful and quite eerie.  Also, there is quite a lot of severing going on in this film, as you'd imagine, though it's generally not terribly gory, I think, as the limbs or head typically just sorta fall off, with out much or any blood.  Some of it is fairly impressive, though most of it is done with CG effects, and I definitely prefer the real thing when it comes to gore effects.<br /><br />I dunno, that's about it.  If a movie looks this good I can put up withabout anything else.  This is not to say that the story and tonal aspects of 'Sleepy Hollow' don't work at all, as they do work quite well for the most part.  But, it coulda been better.  Still, it's more than worth seeing.not to say that the story and tonal aspects of 'Sleepy Hollow' don't work at all, as they do work quite well for the most part.  But, it coulda been better.

B000002GQG|4.0|wow. what can i say the moodies did it again with album number 2 \\"in search of lost chord\\". the album starts out perfectly with the intro called \\"departure\\" where graeme edge is rambling on about nothing however it goes up the crescendo and the end of it is the start of one of the best rock numbers: \\"ride my see saw\\". this song steals the show for best moody blues song on the album. catchy rock song. after this is \\"dr. livingston\\". ray thomas serenades the african missionary with this tune. next is \\"house of four doors\\". this song is wondrfully put together by the always clever mike pinder (keyboardist). there is no otehr song like this in the world! the opening of doors keeping you in suspense and the tremendous bass, drums, and vocal harmonies. i love it! following that is \\"legend of a mind\\", an ode to their crackhead scientist friend timothy leary. tremendous song with the violins and accoustic guitar. post \\"legend of a mind\\" is the smooth \\"voices in the sky\\". it's a happy song with justin hayward singing (this guy is the posterboy for singing). this puts you in a better mood especially when ray thomas's flute comes in. \\"the best way to travel\\" talks about thinking and is another lite tune, not bad. the album ends with a far eastern sound with the sitar and drums. there is a word and the word is \\"om\\", which is also the song. cool song if you like meditating or doing yoga or whatever. interesting way to close the album. sounds like the moodies are following the lead of their hare krshna friend george harrison. in closing i'd like to say this is a nice album and that you should buy it. however i oh so wish that the moodies would have shown justing hayward's guitar prowess more with solos. buy hey we can hear that on his \\"bluejays\\"

She meets up with survivors including Jill Valentine and Carlos whom are part of the S.T.A.R.S. alpha team of the police station, they together must escape the city of horrors or end up dead by zombies, mutants and a powerful new foe called \\"Nemesis\\".<br /><br />Well made and super scary sequel that probably surpasses the original movie in every way since i am a major fan of the video games and enjoyed the first movie, i would have to say this one is great. It's more faithful to the video games than the original movie ever did, but what's cool about this movie is that it's got a better story, more gore, more zombies, more mutants, humor, better action, scares, thrills and chills abound with terrific special effects.<br /><br />The 2-Disc special edition is awesome just like the movie itself! it's got literally killer extras such as deleted scenes, three audio commentaries, previews, Cast outtakes, six-part making of this movie, featurettes and poster gallery. Oh! there's also perfect picture and awesome surround sound with your choice of widescreen or fullscreen versions.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"Lifeforce\\", \\" Nightmare City\\", \\"Cannibal Apocalypse\\", \\"Resident Evil\\", \\"Zombi 2\\", \\" Demons\\", \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\", \\" Shaun of the Dead\\", \\" Hell of the Living Dead\\" ( a.k.a.

B0001XAPY2|5.0|I have seen this anime movie before, in the subtitled version sold in the Hayao Miyazaki collection. Many dubs of good Japanese anime movies or series are horrible.  I have to admit this is a very good dub, and seeing it, I realized I'd missed a few subtle details.  I won't spoil it for anyone, but suffice it to say, that I got a completely different take on the ending by hearing this in English.  Michael Keaton was an inspired choice as Porco. He gave just the right kind of understated, \\"man of few words\\" talk that was expected from his character. <br /> <br />While I'm not certain how old this is, it is definitely from before 1998 when Princess Mononoke was released.  The animation is first rate all the way, and the art is extraordinary, as we've come to expect from recent Miyazaki films.  A friend of mine who viewed it with me said the backgrounds were almost real life, but the characters and things like planes seemed more cartoon like in the foreground.  I personally like the effect, as it gives the characters some dimension.  Too many drawn animes look two-dimensional all the time.  By fading the background a bit and making it more realistic, it brings more life to the characters, and movement of objects. <br /> <br />As for the movie, itself it has a good story that on the surface excites the younger audience, and on a bit deeper level gives the adults something to enjoy.  Porco has a bit of a comment on the history of the time (pre-World War II). Most of that commentary will go right over younger children, who will love Porco and his adventures.  Miyazaki seems to have a love for children. Many of his stories appeal to them without being overly dumbed down, and syrupy. <br /> <br />As for my Disney title comment, they have the rights to these films. If Disney spent a little on promotion, this kind of film plays well for American audiences.  While it angered me at the time, the way they tanked the distribution of Princess Mononoke, and Spirited Away. It may have made some business sense, since they were both in uniquely Japanese settings. Porco Rosso however, is set in the Adriatic Sea, and has many universal adventure concepts, like pirates, spies, airplanes, and hide-a-way desert islands. <br /> <br />As for the DVD, top notch all around, two discs with wide-screen and tons of extra's on the second. The transfer looks great, and while I don't have a THX system to try it, its THX certified and includes a THX Optimizer.  It's also specially enhanced for 16X9 televisions.  An outer cardboard art sleeve protects the inner standard DVD clamshell, which has the same art on it on the cover.   <br /> <br />     <br />
B0007NFL18|3.0|This album is ok but I expected along with alot of others that he would have come up with a better album than this. It has a bunch of average songs and average beats. But he just talks about the same thing as the last album, and once again Eminem made him sound like an amatuer rapper from the song that they have together. I dont know why he continues to let Em make him look bad on his own album. Luckily this album was bootleg because I woulda been pretty upset if I had spent $15 on this. The best song on this album by far is ski mask way!!!
B000002HPT|3.0|Before all of us Dream Theatre fans got a hold of \\"Falling Into Infinity\\" we got the word that it was a sellout record. Was it true? We all feared our beloved band was going to fall into oblivion. Of course we were shocked when we heard it. It was different. For starters, it wasn't as metal. It was more of a rock record. Second, their definitely was a sellout song on it \\"You Not Me\\" which didn't help to sell the record and just plain sucked, replete with some terrible lyrics for Dream Theatre's standard. However, the thing that stood out the most was how much the band changed when Kevin Moore left. They just didn't sound the same. Not only did Kevin Moore have a really unique sound, but he wrote the most haunting and stunning melodies. Only on a few songs does the band even coming close to arousing the emotions that only Kevin Moore's playing and writing could.  <br /> <br />Nonetheless, it is Dream Theatre and it has some strong songs. \\"Trial of Tears\\", \\"New Millenium\\" and \\"Lines in the Sand\\" are all epic masterpieces. Although the band kind of gets lost on \\"Trial of Tears\\" after the keyboard solo. That wouldn't have happened if Kevin Moore was there. There are definitely some forgetable songs (i.e. \\"Just Let Me Breathe\\") but there are moments on here like \\"Hollow Years\\" and \\"Hell's Kitchen\\" when the melody completely grabs hold of every emotion you possess and refuses to let go.  <br /> <br />If you are a Dream Theatre fan you will fall in love with this record just like \\"Awake\\". Unfortunately, you will also be pressing your skip button a few times. Something that would have never happened when Kevin Moore sat behind the keys.
B0007NFL18|5.0|Look I dont even like 50 cent. I thought get rich or die tryin was average on a scale from 1-10 a 5 (just so you know I am not biased). I thought Game made a real hot album probably the hottest in the last 6 months untill I heard this. This album can get played all the way through except for maybe candy shop. A lot of people were saying its wack and not worth it, but you have to decide that for yourself. It totally shocked me my favorite tracks are ski-mask way, god gave me style, and powerful position. Believe me when I say decide for yourself remember they said the color purple was a bad movie.
B00006LLOG|5.0|if someone were to come up to me and say, \\"TRANSFORMER is the greatest album of all time\\", i wouldn't argue; it's definitely in the top few.   <br /> <br />it's commonly thought that the second half of the album isn't quite up to par with the first half. well when you look at track 2-5, you're looking at possibly the greatest four song stretch on any album ever. so maybe the second half of the album isn't as spectacular ['viscious' is also a brilliant song] as the first, but let's look at it for what it is: 'make up' is one of the most vivid/clever songs ever penned. 'satelite of love' is deserving of all the praise that it gets [it's really the only song on the second half of the album that gets mentioned along side 'perfect day' & 'walk on the wild side']. 'wagon wheel' is a brilliantly fun rocker w/ a stunning break down. 'n.y telephone conversaton' is a perfect little song; i wish more musician would put little songs like this on their albums. 'i'm so free' is also great fun. 'i'm so free' is also genius when you pay careful attention to the lyrics. 'goodnight ladies' is one of the greatest closing tracks ever . . . most people [that have heard the album] won't debate this. <br /> <br />i obviously don't want to overlook the first five songs:  <br />'viscious' is an amazing rocker and a perfect song to open the album,  <br />'andy's chest' is one of the very best written songs that i've ever heard, and it builds up oh so well.  <br />'perfect day'. you've probably already heard it if you're reading this, but if you haven't, it's one of the most beautiful songs you'll ever hear.  <br />'hangin' round' is vivid/wild rocker. the characters are completely out there and completely believable.  <br />'walk on the wild side' is one of the top five songs ever recorded by anyone. i'm not going to try to do it justice. <br /> <br />basically, if you don't have this, your album collection isn't all that impressive.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This movie is possibly the most over-hyped two hours of dreary pointless movie one can find anywhere in the world today. Firstly the plot. Old guy meets young woman, have a few nights out in the neon lights of Tokyo, go their separate ways. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is that! Oh yes, the film buffs out there will tell you all about its gentle charm, its understated yet magnificent acting and its heart-warming character development but these are merely the psychological yearnings of the weak-minded. That's what happens when you're bored to tears. You imagine greatness in mediocrity. You long to see Bill Murray return as a major star, but try to forget that what you're watching isn't the best vehicle for that. What happened with Lost in Translation was that a poor script and poor idea for a film made it into production on the basis of the director's daddy. The end result isn't all that interesting, is entirely pointless (and no buffs, the point wasn't the pointlessness, but sure, delude yourselves into believing that if you're happy), has no deep insights and drags on for minute after agonising, painful minute. Buy the DVD, then burn it because the pretty colours will be more exciting.
6305657947|5.0|I sat down to watch this movie and was literally enthralled with the Cat Vs Cat in the movie!  I thought it was a very up-to-date story line, sexy, smart and funny all at the same time!  I haven't watched the first one, and after this one, I don't care to.  The reality is, that we rarely get to watch a really SMART movie, that makes the audience really try to figure out who is playing who!   <br /> <br />I enjoyed all aspects of the movie, and buy only movies that I want to watch over and over.  Needless to say, this is in my collection on VHS.  I couldn't find it for some reason a while ago, and went and got another copy!  Now I'm onto buying a DVD for this, because they just last longer.   <br /> <br />I expect to be able to enjoy this movie for years to come, and each time I watch it, I catch some detail I had missed before.   <br /> <br />Kudos to John McTiernan, Pierce Brosnan and Renee Russo ~ Cast and Crew!  Thanks for a great, enjoyable, don't know how it's going to end movie, with lots of surprises, twists and turns!    <br /> <br />I loved it!
B00005NGAK|4.0|Like most people, I ridiculed Riverdance and everything of the like.  But working in a store that sold this, I was absolutely floored by how awesome Michael Flatly's Feet of Flames was.  This can not be compared to River Dance or Lord of the Dance (precurors to Feet of Flames).  This is much more a show; kind of like the difference between Cirque Du Soleil's Saltimbanco and Quidam.  The production value skyrockets and makes anything else (before it) look archaic.<br /><br />Feet of Flames showcases MORE than just Celtic-style dancing.  There are musical numbers by both a female duo and a solo singer.  There IS some sort of story involved but I never focused too much on it.  The dancing is fantastic.  While the show is geared around Michael Flatly's skills, he does allow his other dancers to have some of the spotlight.<br /><br />The interviews/making-of is quite insightful.  Who would have though that Flatly loses several pounds (of water/sweat) during each performance?  It's a wild show that showcases just how profitable 'riverdancing' can be.  The sheer energy of the show, the performers and even the crowd will make you want to dance along with it.
B0007O38F8|2.0|This was one of the most unoriginal albums I have ever listened to. 50 has absolutely nothing relevant to talk about. Every song says 3 things I still sell drugs, Im gonna shoot you and I'm a pimp. Oh yeah and how much money I have. every song sounds the same and it all sounds like his first song and every chorus he writes for g-unit. Game is the only hope for that crew. What is even more dissapointing is the track eminem produced, piss poor. Also if 50 is going to attack every rapper from NYC he better come harder than that. If your looking for some descent production with stupid rhymes this cd is perfect for you.
B000002LR3|5.0|Screamadelica was, is, and always will be one of those albums that changed the face of popular music. It is a record that wears its influences heavily on its second hand sleeves. Chicago House music, deep deep deep dub, raunchy blues, British techno, Northern Soul, jangley guitars, good night lullaby's and obscure cinematic references are all blended together to form an aural experience that still makes the listener feel like they are visiting another planet. True, it's a planet chemically loaded and ready for an endless night, but isn't that what you sometimes needs your music to do for you? Take you away from the reality of it all and strand you in some weird foreign land. Bobby Gillespie and his merry band of nutjob musicians have taken us to grungier and sonically odder places, but this is the record where all the real scream team lunacy begins. Almost a trip to the dark side of the moon. Take a big hit of this album, hold it in and pass out blissfully!
0226264211|5.0|This book is much better than \\"Road to Serfdom\\" (Hayek) because Friedman offers more specific details and writes in a much lighter fashion. Though the reading is lighter than it was of the aforementioned Hayek book, it is still not all that light. The book, though only 200 pages, should probably be read at least twice--either by the chapters read and then reread before moving onto the next or by reading the whole thing all the way through twice.<br /><br />Good points (not a complete listing):<br /><br />1. Discussion of what keeps the number of physicians in the country artificially low as well as a discussion of how licensure requirments in any given profession can end up creating a defacto labor union.<br /><br />2. Separation between what are the intended results of any given social program versus what actually happens when these ideas are put into practice. So, this could be the Housing and Urban Development board being responsible for the creation of ghettos--none of which existed before they were created. Or it could the creation of the Federal Reserve, which has a lot of power in the domestic economy, and therefore a lot more power to ruin something on a large scale.<br /><br />3. Follow up of almost every single concept with specific examples to show what he is arguing<br /><br />4. Extrapolation of certain arguments to their logical extreme. So, how is it different from 4 people walking along the street and one picking up a $20 bill and being forced to share it by the other three than redistibutive mechanisms imposed by the government on income? How does it make sense for the government to extract subsidies from taxpayers to support higher prices on agricultural products that its taxpayers are going to buy later?<br /><br />5. Discussion of some of the logical consequences of pursuing \\"equal distribution of income\\" as well as some of the reasons that income/ wealth would be unequal no matter what any one does.<br /><br />This book obviously influences a number of other writers that entered the discussion on Libertarianism (i.e., Thomas Sowell). It's also interesting to note that this book was written at the time when the Soviet Union was thought to still be a threat. The collapse of that Empire, almost 30 years after this book was written is its ultimate vindication.<br /><br />Well worth the time it takes to read it!influences a number of other writers that entered the discussion on Libertarianism (i.e., Thomas Sowell).

6305603847|5.0|The Wall is outstanding, both musically and visually.  Superbly well acted, well written, well directed, (see Alan Parker,) and well recieved, this film just gets better with time.  It is the type of movie that could be interpreted in many different ways.  It is full of images of one man's trials and issues, from his father's ghost, killed in war, to the schoolteacher of his youth.<br /><br />People have said you have to be on drugs to like this movie.  They are full of it.  If you like rock music, this DVD is a must see.  A must own.<br /><br />Worth noting is the fact that a few songs contained in the movie are not actually featured on the regular double album.  My personal favorite scene in the movie is this:  Young Pink finds his dad's Army outfit in a drawer and puts it on.  The sequence is set to a powerful song called \\"When The Tigers Broke Free,\\" a fitting tribute to a lost family member killed at war.<br /><br />This DVD is single-handedly to blame for my finally purchasing a surround sound system for my living room.  BUY IT, TURN OFF THE LIGHTS, AND TURN UP THE VOLUME.  The Wall is one of the best pieces of art ever created.
B0007N1AI6|2.0|Its a very ordinary album, and I'm being generous. Its not the comeback album that a lot of the internet folks claim it to be. Hell its not even as good as Brave New World, and that says something. For one, the drums are pretty monotonous with a lot of mindless double bass parts, just like on the million powermetal bands' numbers. Rob Halford's vocals are mostly in the middle range, but the layered high pitched vocals on Judas Rising, Hellrider etc. are annoying... and these songs are like the B-sides or leftovers from the Painkiller sessions. Also there aren't enough guitar parts/solos and this is kinda disappointing. The cover is nothing but a generic one (seems like a shot of the Painkiller robot resurrected on the Judas Priest symbol) and the booklet sucks. However, there are good songs on this album, like Deal With the Devil, Worth Fighting For, and about 6-7 minutes of the too long and boring Lochness (also the chorus is ripped off from an Italian classical number).     I think Perfect Strangers by Deep Purple might be the only good reunion album.
B0007MVXQG|1.0|Just got the new CD/DVD this new thing called a \\"Dual Disc\\". <br />Dont buy it, read the back of the box....\\"The audio side of this disc does not conform to CD specifications and therefore not all DVD and CD players will play the AUDIO side of this disc\\". Nice! <br /> <br />so there is no way to even make a rip then re-burn this to play in my 2 year old car with all the anti-piracy crap on the disc. <br /> <br />How is the CD?  never listened to it, thanks JP and Epic for taking my hard earned money!
B0006IIPIK|3.0|My first question:  why in the world did the producers and directors of this film decide to use the \\"ghost\\" of the great Sir Laurence Olivier in this movie?  It doesn't seem at all necessary and its cleverness merely elicits a scratch of the head from this reviewer.  Oh, well, guess they thought it would be \\"original?\\"<br /><br />Anyway, this film, a digital masterpiece, is a wonderful homage to the films of the 30s 40s and 50s, gorgeously colored and with awesome digital effects.  It is most definitely an eye candy movie, its acting and plot overshadowed by the sheer artistry of the special effects crew.  Suffice to say, Jude Law, Angelina Jolie and particularly Gwyneth Paltrow have never looked more beautiful or stunning.  Giovanni Ribisi is excellent as always in a smaller role, but the real star of the movie is its visionary director, Kerry Conran.  Although I wouldn't want to see a lot of movies filmed in this manner, one must admit the excellence and hard work that went behind it.
B00003CXUM|5.0|Platonic relationships, in cinema as in real life, represent a nebulous, sometimes dangerous terrain: a sphere of carefully set-boundaries, of mutual appreciation that, on the surface, remains confined to the intellectual and the emotional, with the physical act of love itself banished from thought and action.  In real life this fragile balance is often upset by the gradual development of interior feelings - or by the repression of secreted urges - resulting in unrequited desire, in anguish and longing; in cinema, the temptation to milk this repression can often sink the material into the mires of overwrought melodrama, bathos, and clich.  It takes a talented, keen mind to carefully glean the poignancy of the platonic relationship, to avoid the pitfalls of tearjerking indulgence and the convoluted plot-twist.   <br /> <br />Won Kar Wai's *In the Mood for Love* achieves this rare distinction, capturing platonic fidelity - and its inherent torments - with a sure hand and subtle perspective.  This is the second film I've seen of Won Kar Wai's, and he is quickly becoming my favorite director of Asian cinema; the delicateness of his approach, and the masterful juggling of experimental framing and intricate storytelling, is a wonder to behold.  This director fully understands the power of understatement, of allowing the audience to connect the dots, of achieving transcendence within tragic circumstances.  *In the Mood for Love* is a masterpiece, the epitome of the Romance, a genre I tend to avoid due to the overdose of manipulative schmaltz implicit in Westernized attempts.  <br /> <br />The film follows the life-trajectory of two lonely Hong Kong residents in the mid-1960s, Mr. Chow (Tony Leung) and Mrs. Su (Maggie Cheung), who discover that their respective partners are having an affair.  Seeking comfort from the brunt of these infidelities, the two embark upon a relationship of their own, sharing noodles and coffee, collaborating on a martial-arts newspaper serial andslowly drifting from the platonic nature of their affair into more complicated waters.  \\"We won't be like them,\\" is the mantra, the moral high-ground assumed; but it is never that easy, especially when instincts writhe beneath the impeccable surface of the ethical shield.   <br /> <br />The acting is superb - Tony Leung radiates soulful hurt and gives his character a depth only hinted at by the script; Maggie Cheung is exquisite as the faithful wife trapped as much by social conventions as she is by her beautiful cheongsam garments.  Leung and Cheung are established names on the Hong Kong circuit - featured as conflicted lovers in *Hero*, for example - but they inhabit their dramatic personas so totally that one never refers to the other roles they have played; they avoid the artistic bane of overexposed fame, shatter the shackles of screen-iconolatry, and for two hours ~become~ Mr. Chow and Mrs. Su, a bereft pair we simultaneously root for, and root against, hoping they can maintain their platonic vow, hoping they will break it and reach fulfillment.   <br /> <br />This paradox is further shaped into tense being by Wai's experimental perspective-shifts, playing with the 'truth' of the matter via multiple perspectives and isolated sequences.  Christopher Doyle's cinematography is in a class of its own, highlighting the storytelling aspect of the characters and environments without ever calling attention to itself; I recently read that Doyle loves to capture the beauty of women, spending hours to find the perfect angle, the defining frame: Maggie Cheung is exemplified by this painstaking technique.  The music completes the framework of *In the Mood for Love*: source music from the 60's floats in snatches, cementing the film to a tangible era, and Shigeru Umebayashi/Mike Glassoro `s evocative cello and violin score gives thematic counterpoint to that occurring on the screen.  Film is essentially a collaborative medium: when vital talents are assembled for a specificproject, greatness occurs; the original vision is given depth and a grand eloquence it might not have achieved otherwise.  *In the Mood for Love* is a paramount example of this collaborative genius. <br /> <br />This Criterion edition contains several extras, including deleted scenes (which shred certain ambiguous elements; I'm glad they were deleted, and glad they were included here), notes on the music process, and a short tribute film by Won Kar Wai about the icons of Chinese cinema in the 60's.  <br /> <br />Highest Recommendation. <br />
0060594888|3.0|Ok..who am I to argue with a guy who has sold a gazzilion books and is amazingly successful...while I sit in a cube with headphones on wishing I were doing something else...anyway.<br /><br />I agree with this book whole heartedly. In fact, I have implemented some of the strategies from the book and have noticed significant changes in my life. I have a project that I've been working on for three years. It could potential help steer me in the direction I want my life to go as well as make a few extra dollars. By reading just the first few chapters, the wheels are in motions and this project may actually happen!<br /><br />So why did I give it only three stars? It is too much and he gives no strategy regarding how to use all of them. For instance, I want to start my own business. OK, Take 100% responsibility. Check. Now what? Are these steps sequential? Parallel? Do I use certain principles in certain situations but not in others?<br /><br />I realize that these principles must be adopted and lived out, not just used to get what I want. But, for someone just starting to use these principles, a plan of action would be great.<br /><br />One last warning. I agree with Stephen Covey. Before implementing these tips, one must know oneself and have a firm grasp of their values and principles. They must understand what matters most in their life. Once that is figured out then these success principles will come in handy.
B00004TWZF|1.0|I don't know why everyone loved this movie so much. Yes, the scenery was great but I found the dialogue and performances to be absolutely terrible! I also have to agree with the reviewers who did not enjoy the music. Not having heard anything about this movie previous to watching I went in with an open mind and came out horrified (and bored).
B000002BE9|4.0|Fiona's voice is so smoky and edgy in this first album by her. Her songs are softer on this album than on \\"When The Pawn\\" but are still great. \\"Never is a Promise\\" is probably my favorite off of the album and she drones on about someone she's no longer with about how they will never really know her. (At least, that is the way I see the lyrics.) All in all, it's a good buy. If you like her songs, you should get her CDs.
B00070Q7VO|4.0|\\"It's Time\\" is another collection of Michael Buble's predictable favorites delivered in his silky-smooth voice. He glides over the melody of Nina Simone's \\"Feeling Good\\" and sings a note perfect version of the Gershwin classic \\"A Foggy Day (in London Town)\\". \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" turns into a mini Beatles tribute with a few lines from \\"She Loves You\\" injected at the end. <br /> <br />Buble's vocals are always flawless, but that doesn't mean the songs are: \\"Quando, Quando, Quando\\" is a somewhat boring duet with gravel-voiced pop singer Nelly Furtado; their voices clash a bit and this was, to me, one of the weaker songs on the album. <br /> <br />Buble co-wrote one track on the album, \\"Home\\".  Its simple, brass-free arrangement contrasts with the jazzy instrumentation on the rest of \\"It's Time\\", and Buble's delicate vocals turn \\"Home\\" into a sweet lullaby. <br /> <br />Some of Buble's song choices are definitely intended to make his female fans swoon (like \\"Save the Last Dance for Me\\" and Stevie Wonder's \\"You and I\\"), but Buble really shows promise as a songwriter on \\"It's Time\\".... hopefully he'll begin to rely more on his own words in the future!
B00002MZ4W|4.0|When The Pawn...has to be Fiona's best album. The songs are about breakup, hurt, and more. There is so much emotion in her voice when she sings. If you need something to get over the last jerk you dated, this album will do just that.
B0002I831S|4.0|In terms of content, this set is awesome. The episodes look and sound great, and they're all there.<br /><br />The series starts out a bit awkwardly with \\"The Man Trap\\", but quickly gets to classic episodes like \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\". I would have liked to have \\"The Cage\\" preceding the first episode as part of this set, but at least it's included in the 3rd season boxset.<br /><br />I also didn't find the documentaries particulary outstanding, but they are at least informative and free of fluff.<br /><br />Two things irk me about this set: First, the menus - I personally get very weary of flashy CGI menus that play dramatic music every time you push a button. I'd like to be able to just choose an episode and watch it with the push of one button.<br /><br />Second, the packaging. It's just a poor design. I thought the Kirk-uniform-colored plastic case looked cool at first, but once you put it on a shelf with the spine out it looks like crap. It's also very awkward to open. Once you crack the thing open, there's a flimsy booklet and a cardboard slipcase inside about the size of a double CD. Inside the slipcase is an ugly hunk of clear plastic - the DVDs sit in jewel-case type trays which are all connected and which you flip through like a CD wallet.<br /><br />It's just too much of a process to get to one of the discs - I keep mine on the shelf w/o the plastic shell. The drawback to that is that if you don't pick it up carefully, the plastic case slips right out of the cardboard and hits the floor. There's also no good place to keep the booklet if you ditch the outer shell. While the booklet has episode summaries, it's very hard to read and quite poorly designed anyway. If money and space was no object, I would have opted for buying these episodes in the two-episode-per-disc format (each disc in it's own plastic case) to avoid this whole mess.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I am very excited to have the whole first season in my possesion all at once! I doubt this will be repackaged anytime soon, so it's worth owning. But try to find it used - the retail price, and even Amazon's price, is totally ridiculous.e!

B000002U82|5.0|If I were stuck on a desert island, and I could bring three things, I would pack a CD player, headphones and Dark Side of the Moon.  <br /> <br />This is definitive Pink Floyd. I may be a little biased, for this was the first Floyd CD I had ever listened to, but it's still my favorite. The songs are timeless, the production impeccable (especially for being produced in 1973) and the timing perfect. The world was ready for something groundbreaking, and Pink Floyd delivered in powerhouse style.  <br /> <br />The key tracks are all of them. My favorite tracks, however?  <br />Time <br />Money <br />Us and Them <br />And especially the Brain Damage/Eclipse combonation. <br /> <br />If I had to define climactic, I would say the song Eclipse. It builds, and builds until it releases into ecstasy. Those who have listened to it can understand, so I won't try and explain. <br /> <br />Even when you listen to the album, you will recognize all of the songs from the radio. The classic rock station I listen to plays a song from Dark Side of the Moon almost every day. <br /> <br />So, if you are wise, you will heed my advice. If you choose not to, it's your loss. Hopefully you will come around someday. I always thought Pink Floyd was lame until I sat down and listened to Dark Side.  <br /> <br />So do yourself a favor. Buy this CD. It very well might change your life. It did for me.
B00005JN2Z|1.0|OK, where do I begin...? <br /> <br /> <br />...Why does Cruise use a cab...? why does he continue to use this cab after the window is smashed and cops pull it over for that very reason? <br /> <br /> <br />why doesn't Jamie Foxx tell the cops Cruise is a killer when he has the chance?  <br /> <br /> <br />why does he only later make all that noise to alert someone to help him? why does it have to be a corny, cliched \\"street gang\\" straight out of Death Wish 3 (total classic) that happens to hear him? <br /> <br /> <br />why doesn't Cruise use a professional getaway driver? <br /> <br /> <br />why am i supposed to care about the cop character when he gets shot? <br /> <br /> <br />why is it so contrived and ridiculously coincidental that the chick from the beginning is the last victim? likewise, the scene when the cop happens to get into their elevator in the hospital? <br /> <br /> <br />why does the music in this movie suck so bad? and why doesn't it ever stop for one second to let me breathe? likewise, the cheesy, overdone editing? <br /> <br />why does this end with a lame, been-there-done-that chase scene on a subway?  <br /> <br /> <br />why do Foxx and the girl just sit down across from Cruise, not checking to make sure he's dead...? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Answer to all of the above: because without all of these things, there'd be no cliched \\"action\\" movie and no one would make any money. Michael Mann is one of the most over-rated directors working today... He's like Michael Bay for psuedo-cineastes... His Ali is god awful, too...

I really thought Spencer was Spencer until about the middle or slight end of the movie where more details get uncovered. a haunting tale of deception. see this movie. I shall watch it again and again and again and again and again. this will truly haunt your mind if you think you know your lover sometimes.
0312857063|4.0|The first book in the series is one of my top 21 books. (21? I've never felt a need to cap the number of books I have really enjoyed.) Even so, I never jumped to read the sequel. How would the followup followup? Would more to the story just be more to the story? Would it pull down my experience of the first book?<BR>Well I finally picked up the second and started to read. My exact rating would be 3.75. A 'good' opening got me interested.<BR>Then 200 pages into the book I was straining to be drawn into the story. I kept being left with the feeling of 'get on with it'. And suddenly it did! The last 700+ pages were (are) worth reading.<BR>Overall, not as good as the first book, but a good maybe very good followup; but unlike the first book that was good enough to stand on its own, I feel this book needs the next book to be good enough to lift this volume up. Which I now have to go buy.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|I've got to say this is the first album that has just blown me away since \\"OVERKILL'S\\" KILLBOX 13.  You've got it all here songs that sound like rockarolla-painkiller.  My god rob's voice has not lost a key at all!  I will forever hail Judas Priest right there with Sabbath as the \\"KREATOR'S\\" (GOOD BAND ALSO BY THE WAY HA) of this great genre!!!  i was lucky and got an advance copy of this from a great music store a week before release.  you will all be amazed i can gaurantee that...the dvd is great also...All make sure to get OVERKILL's new album at the end of the month!!!! KEEP METAL ALIVE!!!! -forged in black country under blood red skies-judas priest-angel of retribution
B00005JNDZ|3.0|I had to see this movie. After reading & rereading the books & watching & rewatching the first movie, I must say I like Bridget. This movie is stranger than the book though. There are definite differences & they're not entirely pleasant. The best part by far is the fountain fight between Colin Firth & Hugh Grant. Hugh is (thankfully) still a cad in this film. Zellweger is not as attractive as in the first film. Most of her outfits are unattractive & ill fitting. Bridget is very Bridget for the most part. Aside from some of the ridiculous additions, such as the sking sequence. The Thailand sequence could have been better. I liked the addition of Grant into the mix, but the prison part should have been more dramatic, less slumber party. I was hoping to see a meaner Rebecca (ala the book), but Jacinda Barrett disappoints even though we've seen her bare her claws before. Rent first, then decide. I'll probably end up getting this dvd, but I won't pay full price.
B00079FUI6|5.0|According to various sources online, \\"Desperate Housewives\\", the smash dramedy of the year, is being pushed from an August release to a September 20th Release. Although it is unfortunate, everyone can look foward to all the deleted scenes and uncensored ones that never made it on to ABC because it was a little too racy. If you are a fan of \\"Lost\\" will be out a week earlier, so as you can see ABC is definitely bringing out their hits on DVD as fast as they can!
B00005T7I1|5.0|I mena i did enjoy this movie very much, as a kid I was taken to see it in the theatre, and I enjoyed it very much, especially seeing Madonna playing a seductres In Breathless Mahoney. <br />Seeing her prancing around looking the way she did, in those amazing outfits, at the height of her fame and beauty, Might not have been the best thing for a young 11 year old boys mind. <br />But I'm sure as hell am not complaining, then and now. <br />The movie is a very cute pop corn summer action flick, very nior, very hokey, and most of very enjoyable. <br />And of coarse, Madonna. OUCH!!!!
B00006F83Y|5.0|This album is very good.  I would strongly recomend it to anyone who has ever listened to music at one time or another in their lives.  I really like this album and it is in my opinion the best one.  Song For The Dead is one of my favoite songs on the album.  Dave Grohl is a very good drummer and his prescence on this record is much apprecitated by me.  All of the songs are really good.  Josh Homme is one of modern rock's truely underrated guitarists.  Please buy this album if you are contemplating it because I respect anyone who enjoys the Queens.  And do yourself a favor and listen to Kyuss too.
B000063DFN|4.0|It seems as though if you hear 1 Iron Maiden album, then you've heard them all. I picked this one up expecting it to sound alot different from their other albums. The art work and whole theme of the album was different, so I expected the music to be too. It turns out that this just sounds like an extension of \\"Number of the Beast\\". If you haven't heard of Maiden before, then I'd recommend that you start with that one. If you have, then there's really nothing new here. However, it's still a good solid piece of classic metal that offers alot of cool riffs and melodies. Any Maiden fans will find this entertaining.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|I have listened to every song on Angel Of Retribution and I have to rank it as one of the all time Judas Priest classics. The sounds and songs on this CD are as diverse in sound as the band has been spanning their entire 30 year career. <br /> <br />While \\"Wheels of Fire\\" and \\"Demonizer\\" are Painkiller-esque, they have other tunes such as \\"Deal With the Devil\\" which is more like from \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\". \\"Worth Fighting For\\" would fit well on Hell Bent for Leather.  The ballad \\"Angel\\", if it were on \\"Sad Wings of Destiny\\", would already be an all time classic as well as \\"Eulogy\\". \\"Revolution\\" sounds like some of the grinding classics of \\"Sin After Sin\\" and would fit right in with the other songs on it. \\"Loch Ness\\" is not a simple \\"metal\\" song, but more of a \\"rock opera\\" artsy style piece along the lines of \\"Beyond the Realms of Death\\".   <br /> <br />If you want all hard 100 mph grinding stuff go buy some \\"thrash\\", if you want some band crunching the same chords at different tempos and a singer \\"growling\\" in the mic go buy some \\"nu-metal\\" or \\"death metal\\", but if you want some real straight forward classic heavy metal in its truest form buy \\"Angel of retribution\\" by Judas Priest. You will not be disappointed.  <br />
B00005Q4CS|4.0|All I can say is the first 45 minutes or so I was skeptical about this movie, but from the 45 min mark on the movie got quit intense. I dont want to say to much, but, it is a movie you will hate or love there is no in between. Like I said for the first 45 minutes i was  not sure but the last 45 minutes was just so AWESOME its hard to not tell anyone not to check this movie out. <br /> <br />the ending is completley unexpected as it had me  just in complete shock, and up to an an hour and half later still thinking about it.  It is so realistic and it can happen to anyone  in any situation it just make you think wow im lucky not be like that and it hits you right in the heart, wher I actually felt sorry for the mother, Harry ,marloin wayans [whatever his name was , and the girlfriend. The most shocking is what comes of the girlfriedn and the mother. for $10 the movie is well worth quit a intense ending it might offend some , but let me say one thing it was as realitic as it gets. Just an amazing ending and very emotional. Great job.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day in 2004 came out with not only their strongest album to date, but maybe the strongest rock album of the 2000's. The boys are becoming men, and trying new things with their music. The mix of music makes \\"American Idiot\\" a must have rock album of 2004-2005. <br /> <br />Green Day has grown up a lot from their \\"Dookie\\" days, and it shows in the music. If you like opera style rock songs like those from the Who or Queen, \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" is the song for you. If you like ballads that touch on deep issues and thoughts, \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" is the perfect song. Not too slow and not too hard, it has a good rhythm and beat, along with a very solid message. The title track is a popular single in of itself, talking about stupidity in our country and how easily influenced people are. Green Day asks listeners to think for themselves, before acting on actions. They even experiment with Indian guitar in their music on one song! (Kind of like the Beatles did on their transition album \\"Rubber Soul\\"). Like old school Green Day with their hard riffs and simple meanings? They show respect to their old school fans with songs like \\"She's a Rebel\\".  <br /> <br />Green Day's sound has been shifting to a more mature level since \\"Dookie\\", but \\"American Idiot\\" shows just how far this maturity has come. The variety of sound and the deepness of meaning that their music has is fantastic. It's a hybrid rock/alternative/punk/progressive sound that rock has been searching for so long.  <br /> <br />The only disappointment I have is they didn't get album of the year award. Luckily neither did Kayne West (I would have been very upset if he got it over them), but legendary Ray Charles did. I'm glad though that they did get rock album of the year. \\"American Idiot\\" is one of the rare signs today that rock is not on the death bed quite yet.
B0007O38F8|5.0|First there was Biggie, then Jay Z, now it is 50 Cents turn at bat. He is the most controversial rapper in New York right now who is not afraid to call out anyone who threatens his pride. Unlike wannabes like Fabolous who try to imitate the former King (J-hova)50 is original, straight no-holds-barred gangsta. If you don't like it, too bad. G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G UNIT!!! <br /> <br />But still though, I gotta say 50 is probably gonna get shot a few more times cuz of his mouth, he's either a fool or a Don.
B0006399FS|3.0|I love the band U2 and would be the first to recommend any of their hits. However, I felt a lot was lacking from \\"...Atomic Bomb\\". The lyrics and the sound are tired and lack the innovation that U2 has been wonderful at. Though some of the songs are good (like \\"Vertigo\\"), many of them sound too generic. If you want some great U2, check out \\"War\\" and \\"The Joshua Tree\\". This album proves that they are past their prime, still good artists, just not at the stage they once were.
B0007TKH66|5.0|Enterprise boldly, and proudly, actually goes where Star Trek's never gone before. The world changes, and Star Trek Enterprise just follows those changes in the human conditions and reflects them in it's storytelling, it wouldn't be Star Trek if it didn't. <br /> <br />Enterprise is, IMO, the proud carrier of a brightly shining torch handed down by it's predessors, the immortal legends of TOS, TNG DS9 and Voyager. Enterprise proudly keeps that legendary fire with a storytelling, most often, beyond the possible for a series with so many offsprings.  <br /> <br />This DVD release marks the beginning of an era of us being able to own the finest TV series of the 21th century. Enterprise, one to beam up.
B000005Z0G|5.0|\\"Man is that Ayatollah316 a dumb muthaphucka. He said the song Gangsta's Paradise from the movie Dangerous Minds is his favorite 2Pac song, when Pac didn't even sing that song, Coolio did. He also said Puffy was 2Pac's manager, when Puffy was with 2Pac's rival record company. He also said his favorite 2Pac line is \\"i wanna welcome everybody to tha wild wild west\\" and 2Pac didn't even sing that line, that was Dre. But the dumbest thing the 12 year old white kid said was \\"but i feel connected with his words because he talks about how he likes to be high and my dad is a pilot and we fly in his plane a lot and we have a good time. Tupac talks alot how he liked to be really high in his plane.\\" I don't think 2Pac meant he liked to be high in his plane. If u didnt read the kid's review read it and laugh. He is right after my review.\\"     Yo that stuff in quotions is a quote, so im quoting something from someone moron. You call me dumb but you cant tell whats a quote and whats not. Looks like youre the dumb motherphucka
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I was surprised. From the tiny bits and scraps that I had seen of the movie, I was expecting another tired, flat, unimaginative film that took predictable swipes at the socially inept during their high school years. Instead, I found this film almost hypnotic when I wasn't laughing my head off.  <br /> <br />Napoleon Dynamite manages to poke fun at \\"nerds\\" while celebrating their uniqueness. <br /> <br />Sure, the characters seem more like stagnant caricatures than real people. And though they remain so throughout the film (I dont remember ever seeing the Napoleon character ever crack a smile), their journey through the travails of high school somehow paints a human side that lured me into liking them. I discovered myself pulling for Napoleon and his pals while still finding it hard to resist laughing at them.  <br />    <br />The film feels fresh as it sidesteps the slick over-polished Hollywood look. The audience isn't bullied into predictable twists and turns by special effects or a foreboding soundtrack. Instead, Napoleon Dynamite's simple music and serene scenery nestles comfortably around the plot.  <br /> <br />If you're interested in seeing a film that depends on smart writing and clever (if not a bit off the wall)ideas, I recommend Napoleon Dynamite. The Hollywood whistles and bells are missing from this film. The good news is you won't even miss them.   <br /> <br />
B000002B7M|5.0|This is the original version with the original drummer and bassist.
B00005JNQ8|5.0|I saw the trailer at my theater. WOW!! It looks so great and suspenseful. The story sounds good, too. And I like Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman.
0743454529|2.0|I picked this up for the intriguing premise. But the book hardly lived up to its potential. The writing was rambling, full of philosophic cliches and preachy moments that made it hard to get into. The author also seemed to be throwing in far too many subplots; for instance, the brother's arsonist escapades distracted from the real story. Many characters were quite one-dimensional - the mother's single-minded devotion to Kate might have made her a good villain, but surely not a very realistic character. I was especially disappointed by the girls' characters. After reading the book description, I expected Anna to be a strong teenage girl character (always fascinating to read about.) But in this story she's nothing more than a pawn in this philosophical exercise. All in all, a less-than-worthwhile read.
B000003TA4|2.0|This is just typical. Bands were doing stuff like this long before Cobain and crew and doing it better. Kurt is not a great singer, nor the band (except for Dave Grohl)very good either. They just popped up at the right time, when rock had gotten stale and boring (remember the Sex Pistols and the Clash in '77?)and surprisingly it caught on big time. But most people made more out of it than it really was and even Kurt agreed. He hated this album and said so many times. It wasn't punk, it wasn't grunge (which is basically a term used by people who didn't want to call \\"their\\" music alternative), it was alternative, plain and simple. There is one punk song on this record, Territorial Pissings, the rest are hard rock, or alternative. The fact that people took this drug addicted sociopath and made him an icon shows just how bland things were back then. I had to do drugs just to forget this era, it sucked and so did most of this music. Kurt was a decent songwriter and there are a few good songs here, but nothing that elevates it to the legendary album it has become.
B00005O3VC|5.0|My first encounter with this classic Bristish romp was back in high school in the 70's when it made its big screen debut...This great inane farce took us for a loop and knocked us silly and for weeks we roamed the halls blurting our favorite lines..Fast forward 30 years later, after countless viewings, and I still laugh my a*s off!..Let's face it, you either get it or you don't..if you don't, then tsk tsk..you take life way too seriously and frankly..can't be much fun to hang out with!..And what can make watching Python more of a blast???..sharing it with your daughter...and laughing hysterically at the same parts that brought tears to your eyes back when you were her age..I introduced Monty Python and the Holy Grail along with Young Frankenstein (don't get me started on that one!)when she was a mere 10..yeah, some of it got by her..But she's now 16 and it has become one of her all-time favorites,and she joins the ranks of those that can recite the now famous lines verbatim and with uncanny authenticity! I believe it's our duty to expose our children to the classics...Beowulf, Shakespeare, the Beatles and by all means..Monty Python..I'm SO thankful that we share the same mindful quirky offbeat sense of humor..and we GET it!..Join the legions of Monty Python fans and share the comraderie...
B0000029AP|5.0|There are very few Aerosmith LP's that are truly listenable from start to finish. Too much filler and not enough meat is usually the case, but not here! There are no weak tracks and there is something for every fan. The hard rock fans get the title track, Round and Round (probably their heaviest song ever!!), Walk This Way and Sweet Emotion. The ballad fans get You See Me Crying, in which Steven Tyler sings like his life depends on it (especially the last verse). The fans of their late 80's rock get Uncle Salty and No More No More. So why get this as opposed to any of their late 80's and 90's LPs? Because the band were more hungry in 1975 and this music has lots more conviction. The band now relies too much on outside writers (especially the godawful Desmond Child, who has written the same song over and over with countless hard rock bands rendering them impotent), but during this, their heyday, they wrote convincing, heartfelt songs that really moved their fans to do something besides wretch.
B0007NFL18|3.0|This album is series, just as good as his 1st one. The only thing wrong wit 50 cent is his mouth. 50 will never be better than nas lyrically,nas is a legend no one can touch the skills of nas (except tupac and b.i.g). on a scale from 1 to 10 i give it a 7...(songs to look forward to are ryder music, ski mask way, and hate it or love it remix). When you hear piggy bank start laughin cause thats a bad move by 50...
B0007NFL18|5.0|This CD is sick...50 has taken his game to a whole new level.  11 million Get Rich or Die Tryin records? I wouldnt be suprised if he got to 20 mil off this album.  50 has switched his flow for this album and diversified his content.  Dont worry he's still the same G that he was and always will be.  THIS WHOLE CD DESERVES RADIO PLAY! 50 shows that he can rap on any kind of beat and with as much attitude as he wants, and make it sound nice.  Aftermath, Shady and G-unit are runnin the streets now and The Massacre is not only keepin them on top, its pushin them to an even higher level.  THIS ALBUM WORKS FOR EVERYONE WHO LIKES ANY TYPE OF RAP AT ALL!!
6305308659|5.0|This film was ahead of the curve, being a high concept, innovative technical marvel for it's time. The monochrome vs. color metaphor that is the films big-draw trick and center is really about putting yourself out there and taking a chance vs. playing it safe. THAT's the metaphor. Even an eight year old child gets the point. Whether 'they' didn't understand it, or are simply deliberately twisting the meaning in the name of crypto-nazi propaganda is anyone's guess. But they're putting out bad information. If you live in 2005, and find modern media engrossing, you have to give this film it's props. The screenplay isn't brilliant, but the metaphor, and the big trick, are perfect. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

0790732254|5.0|With A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, this may be the hardest American mainstream film to sit through - made before 1970.<br /><br />The langauage, the respectable(but really lowlife)but pathetic protagonists could make you uncomfortable. But it`s worth it. You`ll see four actors at the peak of their form and powers; Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Sandy Dennis and George Segal all excell in this brilliant adaption of a famous stage play. Enough said...

B00003CX9Q|5.0|...but I refuse to watch the new \\"look\\" of the film. Please Mr Spielberg: U gave us a masterpiece, a classic. Every scene was a a classic, but u don`t mess with excellence...<br /><br />The old film of 1982 is not available in Norway any more, but I hope for the sake of future generations, that Mr Spielberg and his like DOES NOT TAMPER with old productions. What if Munch revived his painting \\"Scream\\" 20 years later and had a touch-up with better paint?<br /><br />What I remember is 1 of the most magical children`s film ever made with a splendid Henry Thomas in the lead. Please let us - THE PUBLIC - have the original back... It belongs to us, our memories and the future.
0375507256|5.0|If you are of eclectic tastes or something of a diletante, then this is the book for you.  I won't bore you with too much in the way of detailed descriptions as the professional reviewers do a great job of that.  What I will say is that this book cuts to the core of the philosopher's quest to derive meaning from existence.  Albert Camus once said that a novel is just a philosophy put into images, and this is certainly true of this book.  Ambitious in scope and wonderfully executed.
B000002J1U|5.0|Writing reviews about Led Zeppelin is simply a waste of time. Everything this band ever made is worth buying and playing over and over again.  Some may say that Led Zep reviews are for the kids today who didn't grow up listening and may need to be introduced to Led Zeppelin. Well I say that even most kids have heard of Led Zeppelin and if they aren't smart enough to seek out some LZ cds then the hell with 'em.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Look past the bad cover art (which is the only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars, because the cover art is an essential part of a maiden album) and listen to this album.  It's completely preposterous to say that this album is in any way an attempt to be \\"commercial\\" or \\"modern sounding\\" (as stated in other reviews here).  Dance of Death is a pure Iron Maiden album filled with the same kind of amazing songs which can take you to another world.<br /><br />Iron Maiden is probably one of the few bands that has remained consistent in sound over the years.  More bands should learn from that consistancy.  This album is what you would expect to hear from Maiden, and that's the way Maiden fans want it.<br /><br />The production quality of this album is very well done, and very British in nature (mostly live recordings, mostly done in one take).  All of the guitar parts are well written, and the production is able to capture the sheer heaviness of the album without creating a muddy incoherent recording.<br /><br />Many tracks stand out here, such as the opening track \\"Wildest Dreams,\\" which is probably one of the best opening tracks I've ever heard.  It is the perfect start to this record.  \\"Montsegur\\" is definately one of the heaviest tracks that you will ever hear.  This song will blow away any metalhead with it's sheer badassedness (yeah that's a word).  Other highpoints include \\"Gates of Tommorow,\\" which features amazing vocal harmonies from Bruce, and the title track of the album which almost has an H.P. Lovecraft feel to it.<br /><br />Definately get this album and please don't overlook it or write it off.  It is an amazing effort from an amazing band, and I would expect nothing more or less (except some better cover art).
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I didn't know they had it in them, after the release of the brilliant \\"De-Loused in the Comatorium\\".  However, they managed to top it (I think) and make an album so brilliant, it will undoubtedly propell them to the forefront of rock music, both in talent and popularity.  Highly recommend for anyone who enjoys great rock music!
B000003CMB|5.0|Yes, it's been said before.  This is very likely the very finest rock record ever recorded.  Certainly the finest live rock record.  Of course, there's The Who's Live At Leeds, The Dead's Europe '72, and a host of others that those in the know rightly hold in high esteem.  But with all due respect to all of those other bands-- it just doesn't get any better than this.  Never has, and probably never will.  I'm not a religious man, but one has to wonder if God himself (herself?) had a hand in this.  Maybe someone somewhere knew that Duane was not long for this world, and this was to be his masterpiece.  Whatever the case, this performance is almost otherworldly-- it gives you goosebumps.  And in all fairness it's not all about Duane, either. Every member of the band is absolutely, chillingly, amazingly spot-on.      I first heard this album when my brother purchased it on LP shortly after its original release.  Since then I've owned at least three copies of it, including an audiophile LP pressing.  I can't ever imagine being without a copy of this album, and if you truly love rock or the blues, neither should you.  Whipping Post is incredible.  Elizabeth Reed is mesmerizing.  This is my all time favorite version of Stormy Monday (apologies to Bobby Bland, T-Bone Walker and Lee Michaels, among others).  And I could go on-- every cut is absolutely astounding.  And, this is truly one of those cases where the total is equal to more than the sum of its parts.  If all you know about the Allman Brothers Band is Jessica or Ramblin' Man (both great cuts in their own right), then you don't really know this band.  They were fine country-rockers, but their true genius was with the blues.  And genius is not an overstatement.    In short, if you don't own a copy of this album, drop whatever else you're doing (i.e., stop reading this review) and either place an order for this disc or go directly to the nearest music store and buy it.  Now.  Not tomorrow.  Not in a few minutes.  Now.No one should go through life without hearing it at least once.  And if you've heard it once, you'll hear it again and again and again.  Of this I'm certain.
B00005JMXX|3.0|The Day After Tomorrow had the prospects of being a legendary disaster movie like The Poseidon Adventure & The Towerring Inferno, but it has too many holes in it, esp. the plot to be that way.  It starts out with a \\"conerned scientist\\" who alerts the people to the prospects of the world coming to an end soon.  The people however do not believe what he's saying & continue on their daily lives like nothing he said is gonna mean anything. <br />The world then suddenly launces into full-blown battles all over, with every country looking to garner as much land as possible.  Meanwhile, slowly bu assuredly the weather begins to go haywire little by little, snowstorms in Los Angeles, huge tidals in New York, record droughts in the tropics, etc. <br />By the end of the movie, the human race is stil alive but barely after fighting off both rival nations & wacky weather, both equal threats to the end of the world. <br />The acting, special effects, & music are all top-notch & keep this an edge-of-your-seat action filled movie.  The camerawork is good, esp. in the weather scenes & first signs of war.  The storyline is a little weak as the story jumps around timewise too much & doesn't keep things moving smoothly too well.  The plot is the biggest con of the movie, it has some decent movies, but is mostly just padded with excessive and/or unnecesary moments in it, the dialogue at times is pretty bad, but generally okay.
0345423496|1.0|I and a lot of other science fiction readers have gotten used to the idea that Clarke was a true prophet. In the 1940s and 50s he made a number of predictions, such as satellite communications using synchronous orbits, which have come true. He had a rash of other ideas which I will not explore. 3001 showcases some of them, but it also reveals another side of Clarke--his blindness. <br /> <br />3001 is full of libels against religion in general and Christianity in particular. One wild idea is that a future pope (Pius XX) will renounce his faith due to the \\"space monoliths,\\" release the records of the Inquisition and thereby cause the collapse of Christianity. This idea is possibly a sign of a mental hardening of the arteries. No way, Mr. Clarke. The Inquisition is old hat. No one today gives a damn about it except a few historians. And a lot of people think it was a hoot--thanks to Monty Python. <br /> <br />More disturbing yet is the peculiar Professor Theodore Khan of Ganymede whose field of interest is the \\"psychopathology known as religion.\\" His--and obviously Clarke's--ravings against religion and reveal a profound ignorance of religious feeling. He describes some of the cruelties perpetrated in the name of relgion, failing to mention many of the worst. But, he completely ignores the murders of atheism. Let's see--Lenin and Stalin, 40-50 million, Adolph Hitler, 20 million, Mao Zedong, 100-120 million, Pol Pot, a trivial 3 million. Just counting these we a have a total of 173-193 miilion people. That is far more than fell to all the Inquisitions, Crusades, and Jihads combined. Millions slaughtered to produce a world free of God. <br /> <br />I would rather not live in Clarke's 3001. A world without God is a world without hope, full of cruelty and human depravity. I suggest that Clarke read Paul's Letter to the Romans, Chapter 1, Verses 18-23 and Orwell's \\"Animal Farm\\" before writing diatribes against relgion. There are worse things than religion. If you attach any value to religious belief do not read 3001.
B0002EXH54|5.0|I am always debating which is the superior Megadeth Album: Rust in Peace, or Peace Sells...This album is another one of those classic thrash albums that every metal loving person should already have in their collection..if you don't, you should.  Every song on this album is top notch, and the production is very good as well.  Overall, you can't go wrong with this album.  It is definitely a must have.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Wow. This album is hands-down the BEST album to come out this year, and I can promise you none will come close to it. It is writhed in both simplicity and complexity, it is both impatient and unwearied, and it is a masterpiece. Every song will raise you to unparalleled heights and then suddenly drop you miles below the surface, like a fervent roller coaster - not just one track, EVERY second of the this album is infused with meaning and substance. There is not a second of silence on this unrelenting record, and it will astound you with each and every listen.<br /><br />Go out and get this album. It is an experience you won't soon forget.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|The Banks family is in need of a new nanny for Jane and Michael.  Fortunately, one arrives on the wind in the form of Mary Poppins.  She's everything the kids want, fun and magical.  But while she's taking them to chalk painting countrysides and tea parties on the ceiling, their father is less then happy.  Can he be made to see beyond the end of his nose?<br /><br />Ok, so this movie is really little more then an excuse for song and dance numbers.  It's still great!  The plot is paper thin, and you loose site of it in the middle of some of their fantastic scenes.  Of course, part of that is because the movie is based on a book that is really nothing but short stories.  Still this movie is more about fun then anything else.  And it has that in spades.  What kid wouldn't have fun imaging that they get to do all the things that Jane and Michael do in this movie?<br /><br />It's said that Walt Disney poured everything he had learned into making this film, and it shows.  Many of the special effects hold up remarkably well today.  There were some I still hadn't figured out until watching this special edition.  And the music!  Any fan of Disney knows these songs by heart.  And you can't help but find yourself humming \\"A Spoonful of Sugar,\\" \\"Jolly Holiday,\\" \\"Let's Go Fly a Kite,\\" or \\"Chim Chim Cher-ee\\" for days after seeing it.<br /><br />Those wanting to own a great DVD of this film won't be disappointed in this two-disc set.  Disc one features the movie in all its wide screen glory.  I can't see how it's ever looked better.  The soundtrack has many different options, but the Home Theater mix will blow you away.  It's fantastic.  There is also a commentary track featuring Julie Andrews, Dick van Dyke, Karen Dubice (Jane), and Richard Sherman.  Sprinkled in are archive comments from others, including Disney himself.  Also included are some pop up facts to read along with while watching the movie.  Disc two features a new documentary on the film, a deleted song, and more on the music with Julie, Dick, and the composers.  And be sure to check out the animated \\"The Cat That Looked at a King,\\" a tale adapted from one of the later books in the series.<br /><br />One thing that comes through loud and clear in this set is how much fun everyone had making it and how much they respect Walt Disney.  The fact that this film has lasted 40 years is testament to his genius.  With this set, it'll be enjoyed by generations to come.re on the music with Julie, Dick, and the composers.

I wish i could give a better review but i cant, to me it was WEAK>.
B00003CXB6|3.0|Dr. Malcolm is surprised to learn that there is another island full of dinosaurs.  He's even more surprised when he learns that his girlfriend has gone to the island to study the dinosaurs in their natural environment.  Convinced she's in danger, he sets out to rescue her.<br /><br />Meanwhile, another group arrives on the island, intent on capturing the creatures for a theme park in San Diego.  When the two groups meet, ciaos ensues, and suddenly it's a fight for survival against these ancient beasts.  Who will get off the island this time?<br /><br />To my surprise, I enjoyed the first movie and looked forward to this one.  I made the mistake of reading the book first, however.  While the first one was a decent adaptation of the book, this movie tried too much to do it's own thing.  And the story suffers as a result.  Don't get me wrong; there are some great action scenes.  The trailer sequence is especially a favorite.  But most of the time, it doesn't hold up to the book or the first movie.  And don't even get me started on the ending.<br /><br />The first movie will be considered a classic monster film.  This movie left much to be desired.  Just another example of how bad sequels can be.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|after having listened to their last album, de-loused in the comatorium, time and time again, i often wondered how they could really follow up something of that magnitude and vitality. well, less than two years later here i am with a copy of frances the mute. it's amazing - there's really no other way to put it. the album is meant to be heard as one piece, and it flows as such much more than de-loused did. true, gone is the almost constant intensity of the last album, but i think room for breathing is a nice change of pace. right now, i have that feeling that i always look back upon and try to revive; i feel like i'm hearing something truly new and exciting to my ears. it's as if i went back 20-some-odd years and heard pink floyd's \\"wish you were here\\" for the first time...well, at least that's what i feel it must've been like.
B00005JN0T|5.0|In the not too distant future, robots are a normal part of life, doing menial tasks and taking care of humans.  With built in rules to make sure they never become dangerous, everyone is happy.<br /><br />Except Del Spooner.  A police detective, he has an innate distrust of machines.  So when his friend and the inventor of robots turns up dead, Del immediately suspects a robot.  When no one takes him seriously, he turns to Susan Calvin for help.  But is he correct?  If so, can he prove the truth and saves humans?<br /><br />This is a fun movie.  It's meant to entertain, and it does it in spades.  The plot is cleaver with some nice clues thrown in to keep the viewer engaged.  And the car chases and action scenes keep you on the edge of your seat.  I'm not a super big Will Smith fan, mainly because of the movies he's chosen to do in the past.  But here he did a great job playing a detective with something to prove even when no one else believes him.<br /><br />This movies sets out to be nothing more then an escapist thrill ride.  And it succeeds in spades.  Perfect for a couple hours of entertainment.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|With some of the PG-13 tripe coming out as horror nowadays, SAW is a refreshing step back into the good old days where horror meant blood, and blood meant horror.  No annoying harpies or pretty pictures of hell or tragically humanized vampires here, just an ingenious killer with an obscure motive.<br /><br />SAW dives right into the depths of the madness too, opening with our killer's current victims, two men chained on opposite ends of a filthy restroom, a body in the center clutching a cassette player and a handgun.  Each man is given a tape to play, which provides him with a nice dilemma to ponder during his captivity.  The background of the killer and the events leading up to the men's current situation unfolds nicely during narrated recollections and well-placed flashbacks, while the actual motive stays hidden underneath the obvious delight the killer derives from the simple pleasures of torture.<br /><br />Because SAW also brings to film an excellent `Whodunnit?', I am not going to elaborate on the storyline any further.  Suffice to say that Cary Elwes and Danny Glover give excellent performances (Elwes surprising me since I have only seen him in comedy roles), the photography is good, the killing methods tasty, the blood not really overdone but still dosed out well, and the plot sustainable.<br /><br />Lets face it fans, we don't go to horror movies to learn how to do decoupage, we go to get scared and grossed out.  SAW fulfills that primal hankering, leaving you to utter `blech' and `bravo' in the same troubled breath, and wondering what your punishment would be like under the careful ministrations of this psychopath.<br /><br />Aficionados of the genre are going to love SAW's mixture of gore, insanity, ingenious traps, and filth, while non-lover's of the theme should stick to `Sleepless In Seattle' and other such ilk.  SAW put the taste of terror and gore back in my mouth, something that has been lacking in some of the recent sugar-coated intruders into this bloody domain.  Enjoy!!into this bloody domain.  Enjoy!!   <br /> <br />
B0007N1AI6|4.0|If you have be longing for this day?, you wont be disappointed as long as you're a genuine Priest fan. Every JP album has had a different vibe to it and this offering is no different other than the fact that it really does a great job of encompassing all that is Priest. It's fast, it's slow, it's melodic, it's got texture, it's got aggression, it's got balls. Halford is once again where he belongs, steering the good ship Judas Priest. He has a knack of bringing the best out of the rest of them and this cd proves that. In the Ripper years, Priest was missing something, an ingredient that was absent so to speak. Well I'm here to say, that missing ingredient is back and this helping of Priest is a good start to what should be a fantastic comeback by one of the worlds greatest metal bands. As far as tunage goes, I love them all and really get off on Lochness. I know it's a little long, even a little plodding at times and those lyrics are chessy as hell, but it just sticks in your head and to hear Rob belting out that chorus, Lochness!!!, man it just says WELCOME BACK!!<br /><br />A solid return by the metal masters, not quite a 5 outta 5, but certainly a solid 4 or even maybe a 41/2. If I was to complain about something, it would be that I wish they would have perhaps had a little more info on the band (yes we all know who they are) in the cd jacket. Updated pics and some thoughts on the reunited Priest would have been cool. Other than the lyrics and the usual art work, credits etc, it's pretty sparse in that department. Cd sound quality is very good and that's Roy Z's department. He does not disappoint as all the instruments can be heard and that's a huge improvement over the last 2 cd's as the mixes were terrible.<br /><br />The DVD part is a very cool extra as it lets you in on how they got back together and tells you a little of what these guys are about. With Rob back at the helm, these guys seem truly thrilled about the fact that they are all back together again. This reunion can only lead to bigger and better things in the future if this first release is the standard of what's to come.<br /><br />I will be front row when they tour this year and I'll be loving every bloody minute of it!!<br /><br />Welcome back Judas Priest!!can only lead to bigger and better things in the future if this first release is the standard of what's to come.

B0002J4ZWS|5.0|A lot of fancy words have been used in some reviews of this film. If you want my advice, this is simply the best film you will probably see.<br />Spend part of a Sunday afternoon in front of your tv and turn it up! :-)
B00069YE0W|5.0|My Rankings: <br /> <br />    1.Shadows Collide With People <br />    2.Curtains <br />    3.DC  <br />    4.The Will To Death <br />    5.Inside Of Emptiness <br />    6.A Sphere In The Heart Of Silence <br />    7.Automatic Writing(Ataxia) <br /> <br />My inclusion of Shadows on the list was a must because it is the best of the discs he put out in '04.  That record, in my opinion, is his most accomplished. DC would most likely had been number two if John had made it an LP.  All four of those tracks are crazy excellent!  I put Ataxia at the bottom because it was a collaboration, even though it's John's brainchild.  I still love that albulm to death. If they continue to release more music however, I'm almost sure it will be a hell of a lot better.  \\"The Sides\\" alone is worth owning that record.   <br />     <br />I have to say it has been a glorious adventure with John this past year and I cant wait till he does it again.  His music has not left my cd player, or my head for that matter, in months, a lot of months actually.  Tool and Pearl Jam are the only other musician's who have kept me continually foucused on one \\"music\\" that long.  I'm almost positvie, beautiful things are to come from me in my life because of John's music....Thanks man, it is much appreciated! <br />
B0000UJDLM|5.0|This movie can be viewed on a basic level: action, explosions, gunfire!  On a \\"higher\\" level, there are the characters: Ally Sheedy's naive, ditsy lover of disadvantaged creatures, who takes in stray animals.  Her wide-eyed confidence, \\"I KNEW you'd pick me!\\", when she thinks the robot is an alien visiting earth, is typical of her endearing character.  The relationship to the robot is very credible.  The gestures of the robot are better than E.T.'s and must have been designed by an actor.   <br /> <br />On another level, there are the political and economic implications: weapons research, the tension between congress and the military, etc.   <br /> <br />On another level, there is the wit: the Indian character's slight alterations of American cliches forces us to hear those cliches for the first time and to see how silly some of them are.   <br /> <br />Finally, for the contemplative, there is the metaphysical level: what does it mean to be alive?  what is the difference between being alive and merely being functional?   <br /> <br />It would be surprising if there were anyone who couldn't find something to enjoy in this movie.   <br />
B0007NFL18|5.0|But seriously.  It's an excellent CD.  Surprisingly, some of the beats aren't as well-crafted as the beats on The Game's CD, even though 50 is a far better MC than Game.  Perhaps Dre should have spent more time on the Massacre.  I must say, though, that \\"A Baltimore Love Thing\\" is a really terrific song.  Just excellent--I can't stop listening to it and cracking up.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|best Priest album since Painkiller, only Screaming for Vengeance is better . . .
B00009W0U4|3.0|When I watched this film, I already new that it was shot in reverse order from all the reviews I have read previously and I still had problems keeping up at times. What also made it confusing was the way the scences were shot, with the camera always spinning around and having to read the subtitles while trying to pay attention to learning characters and plot details. I found the ending or shoud I say the beginning powerful yet bittersweet because Marcus himself didn't get his revenge personally. The film was good enough and held my interest anyway, but I suggest watching it a second time, but this time in reverse order from the last chapter to the first to fully see what you have may have missed.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This album is simply amazing. I've been a fan for only about a year, but they have become one of my all time favorite bands. The cd has a good mix of spanish and english lyrics. The first time I heard the cd it blew my mind. Its a bit different than De Loused, but still very awesome. I also love the fact that the songs are much longer than with most everything else out there. They average about 13min a song. <br /> <br />A must have CD!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|His crooning gets me swooning! You just try to remain unaffected when he sings love songs - bet you can't!! Buble's own well written new song \\"Home\\" lent itself to almost another music style, but it's warm words and message is so pleasing and bears listening to over and over and has won me over. <br />I truly love how he changes tempo throughout this classic packed cd the mix is strong and Buble' assurance and confidence shines. <br />Chris Bottti's participation is a welcome treat as is Nelly Furtadu's duet. I never imagined her singing this style of music, and once again Buble's pop sensibilities show his talent for knowing what works. Keep it up Mr.Buble', bring on more!!!!!
0380002930|5.0|It's difficult to translate the plot and feel of an epic into a form that younger readers can enjoy, but that's just what Richard Adams has done here.          Watership Down tells the story of a group of rabbits who, driven by the forebodings of a psychic bunny named Fiver, decide to abandon their warren and strike out on their own to found a new rabbit community. The group of rabbits sets out on a long and perilous journey, encountering every type of danger imaginable, and must pool their various talents under the leadership of the noble Hazel to survive.          Something about these rabbits is so amazingly real that it's impossible not to get wrapped up in their lives. Adams has given them the power of speech and the ability to plan ahead, but they possess severe limitations that make their interactions seem realistic. Along the way, they find other rabbit warrens that have their own way of doing things, and Hazel's little band must find a way to forge a rabbit utopia that avoids the pitfalls of the societies they face.          The ending involves climactic battle scenes with General Woundwort, a militaristic dictator who embodies bunny evil.         Each of the rabbits in Hazel's group has a distinct personality that goes beyond embodiment of a stereotypical character trait. You will love each of them in turn, and also come to appreciate the culture in which they operate, complete with rabbit-only words and folk tales that resonate with meaning.          Watership Down has the intelligence of a literary classic, and the accessibility of a great and moving read. This is the perfect book to transition a young reader from children's books to adult novels, and I wasn't at all surprised to hear that it has become a staple in some classrooms.         Great books like this may only come into your reach once in a lifetime. I suggest that you grasp this one, and hold on.
B00004S367|4.0|ste fue el primer disco autoproducido por Stevie Wonder que compr y escuch. Antes de l, para m Stevie era casi una incgnita. La versin remasterizada de \\"Music of my Mind\\" tiene un sonido realmente espectacular. El CD me sorprendi muchsimo, aunque me llev algn tiempo digerirlo bien. Hay que aprenderlo a escuchar. Aunque reconozco que algunas canciones se me hacen un poco largas, como Superwoman, otras son sobervias. \\"Love Having You Around\\" y \\"Keep on Running\\" son funky y explosivas. \\"Happier than the morning sun\\" puede ser una de sus melodas ms bellas. \\"Every Little Thing...\\" y \\"Sweet Little Girl\\" hacen honor a la mejor tradicin del sonido Motown. Todo producido y tocado casi enteramente por Stevie. En definitiva, si bien no es su mejor lbum, es una puerta que abre mundos auditivos y que muestra la calidad de la msica de Stevie Wonder.
B0007O38F8|1.0|G-Unit will take a major hit by kickin THE GAME out game wasnt the best rapper ever but his cd was hot and he has enough talent to realese a classic one day. Lets hope YAYO doesnt put garbage like the massacre out. The songs are repetitive and boring not the classic get rich or die tryin. I wish i had bought the first cd again instead of this. The ski mask way is the hottest song cuz its not embarASSing to bump in the system and it doesnt have 456 GGGGG-Unit references in it. What happened to rap, when is it ok for someone who hasnt proven themselves (even though he sold 11 million so did vanilla ice) to diss a legend like NAS, last i recall the ony one who could was JAY-Z arguably one of the best. NAS did call 50 out by calling him fake but u know what his raps are fake he raps about rims and jewelry while NAs raps about the struggles of the streets, homelife in the ghetto, the war, basically anything that has depth. Sorry to the 50 cent fans who might get offended but i was once there with u, 50 was the man but until he raps about things that matter to me and actually uses his talent and shut his mouth i cant support him. MY only hope now is he beefs with the wrong person and gets crushed so that he can be hungry and humble like he once was when he was gettin rich or dyin tryin. PS I think its time to quit beefin when ur almost killed in your hometown
B0007N1AI6|5.0|Huge fan since sad wings/british steel and on and on. What can I say. Rob Halford IS BACK . I followed his solo career when he left and was impressed. He has brought it back to priest better than ever. This band could teach a lot to the new metal craze. To me it sounds like they have gone back to theyre roots. Wether your a priest fan or not, there is something here you will like. Wether its the ballads, or the metal grind, or the voice of the metal god.  <br /> <br />Welcome back ROB <br /> <br />
B0007GAEW6|5.0|\\"Frances the Mute\\" is an astonishing 77-minute long, 5 track cd about a diary found by Jeremy Ward (former member of TMV). He found this before he died (in May of 2003) and decided to share it with the rest of the band.  <br />If you liked \\"De-loused in the Comatorium\\", you'll LOVE \\"Frances The Mute\\"! It contains incredible guitar solos and one of a kind lyrics! 5 incredible songs: \\"Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus\\"; \\"The Widow\\"; \\"L'via L'viaquez\\"; \\"Miranda that ghost isn't holy anymore\\" and a 32 minute song called \\"Cassandra Gemini\\".  <br />There is no other band like The Mars Volta. You shouldn't miss out on it! <br />
B0007O38F8|2.0|i had the luxury of gettin my hands on this album a couple weeks ago. since then, i have listened to hit about 4 or 5 times. Throughout the entire cd, i only heard one line that i thought was remotely clever. not one Verse, one LINE.  <br /> <br />\\"sometimes i sit and look at life from a different angle, dont know if im god's child or satan's angel.\\" - I'm Supposed to die tonight. That was the only line on the whole album that i thought was hot. Gatmann and Robbin has gotta be the most wack song i've heard in my life. for real.  <br /> <br />candy shop. that song does what its supposed to do. make puplicity for olivia and promote 50's new album. but thats it. im pretty sure that 50 got his rhymes for this track from his book of cut rhymes. (probably the majic stick page). I cant believe that 50 is using this as single, and then callin' out joe crack. PLEASE. alot of people dont know that this beat was produced by Scott Storch. Scott Storch produced this beat WITH Fat joe. Fat joe said he didnt want it cause it sounded too much like lean back. 50 is biten the hand that feeds him.  <br /> <br />After all the hype about piggy bank, i dont think 50 could have made a less dissapointing battle track. all he had to say is \\"i get paid, you don't\\". FOr real, 50 must not understand that there are different types of emcees. Jadakiss, fat joe, and nas are the rappers that dont sell much but are respected in the street. As much as it pains me to say it, 50 is the next ja rule. jUst wait, im tellin u, in the next two years, everyone will hate 50 as much as they hate ja. seriously, hes already gettin shot at outside radio stations. NEw York city hates him, so where can he rep? all 50 is, is a knucklhead who gets the top producers to give him good beats, then he spits generic crap over it so that aftermath can sell units to white kids in the suburbs.  <br /> <br />I have a feeling that one of the big reasons why 50 and game are gettin into it now is that 50 is mad because games album is better than his.  <br /> <br />To all the 50 stans: THIS ALBUM IS STRAIGHT GARBAGE!! PLEASE ADMIT IT.  <br /> <br />Get rich or die tryin = 4 1/2 mics <br />Guess who's back = 4 mics <br />THe massacre = 2 mics <br /> <br />The massacre high points: in my hood, im supposed to die tonight, ski mask way, i dont need em <br /> <br />I can sum up this album like this. Hot production overshadows lazy lyrics from a rapper that used to bring it. But 50 has already fallen off after 1 good studio album and a decent ep. <br /> <br />My prediction, this album gets no love from the streets, especially new york, but will still sell 5 million units at the very least because it is so commercial.
0553213105|5.0|I had to read this book my senior year in High School and I was afraid that it would be a boring, long read. But I was so wrong! It's an amazing story of...well pride and prejudice! Jane Austen is very witty and I found myself laughing and sighing and worrying as I read. Elizabeth is a wonderful heroine that you find yourself relating to and wishing to be! What a life those young women must have led! And Darcy, well I fell in love with him immediately. You can't get any better than Darcy when looking for a man who would do anything to protect and help you. I loved reading about the cynical Miss Bingley and her sister; silly Lydia and Kitty; obnoxious Mrs. Bennet; and hilarious Mr. Collins. This book is my favorite classic! I strongly recommend reading it BEFORE watching the movie!
B00005ASHM|1.0|Never heard of em <br />Someone said they were good so I brought this. <br />Thought ok but, where are the tunes. <br />U2's latest album is better and more inspirational. <br />It should be listened to by millions, this isn't music just noise. <br />I can't understand why it's rated? <br />All the songs sound the same <br />The singer, forgot his name, got no emotion, I think that guy from Good Charlotte is good, and is one of the all time greats. <br />Also Celine Dion, is the mistress of love songs, buy her greatest hits for true greatness. <br />U2 How to Dismantle an Atom Bomb a must buy album. <br />So is Rumours by Fleetwood Mac. <br />I think this is only for the mentally ill, or sort of things to play to interrigate people. <br />I think the Spice Girls are inspriational truely the greatest pop group ever \\"Zig-A-Zig-A\\" what genius. <br />Also what about Steps and S Club 7, genius's. <br />Also bananarama, brilliant!!!! <br />This is pop <br />REAL POP <br /> <br />This album is noise <br />Give me Celine Dion any day!!! <br /> <br />P.S. <br />The E stands for Expert!!!
068983571X|5.0|I usually don't read mystery novels, but I had to get a taste of Sherlock Holmes. I loved Hound of the Baskervilles. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is a wonderful author and really personifies Sherlock Holms and dear Dr Watson. Holmes is so funny! I found myself laughing at the crazy stuff he comes up with. How in the world does he figure this mystery out?! I had no clue who was the real culprit until the very end! Amazing. You'll enjoy reading it, I promise!
0316666343|5.0|This book is very captivating it made me never want to put it down. I started reading it for my english class at school but I found myself reading it every chance I got. The story of the young girls murder made me sad because just think that stuff like that really happens in our world today.One thing I liked about this book is the detail. The books descriptiveness made the book seem to me like a movie instead of an actual book itself. <br /> <br />All in all this book is an awesome read. Im on my second time reading it which tells you how awesome I truly think the book is. I would reccomend anyone to read this book.  It made me very emotional and see how cruel the world can be.
B00009ATIX|1.0|I nearly fell asleep in the first 20 minutes, and frankly I could not get past those first 20. I wanted very much to like this film because it seemed like an interesting premise/idea. The Russian original was certainly to my liking. Unfortunately, though, this was just very dry and difficult to follow.
B0000027EP|3.0|im a huge motorhead fan so i must say this doesnt live up to the other albums,if your lookin for good motorhead my fave album would either be orgasmatron or iron fist, no sleep till hammersmith is great for those who love the raw live sound
0743454537|4.0|This is a story of Anna Fitzgerald who is 13 years old.  Her sister Kate has been diagnosed with cancer since she was a baby-<br /><br />Kate's doctor gave the idea to the parents that they could possibly have another child who could be the donor of umbilical blood cells to the sister Kate.  The parents, Sara and Brian conceived a child thru a petrie dish that would match exactly to Kate's blood type for the purpose of putting Kate in remission.<br /><br />After so many years of \\"trying to save Kate\\" Anna decides that she no longer wants to be Kate's savior and files a lawsuit to insure that she no longer is a pin cushion and donor for her sister.<br /><br />This story is written in the seven voices of the characters of this book.  Example- the first chapter is written by Anna in first voice so you can imagine and feel how Anna feels.  The most heart wrenching for me were when the mother \\"talks\\" in her chapters and she explains her love for both of her children. Very tough-<br /><br />This storyline affects everyone in the family- the brother, Jessie has emotional and drug problems stemming from his sisters'critcal situation.  Anna- of course because she is expected to donate without thinking of the consequences to her or her body.  Brian-the father and how he works himself to escape the turmoil of his homelife.  Sara-the mother who wants to \\"save Kate\\" at all costs and how this affects her as a mother, and wife.  Kate- the child with the cancer- how all of this effects her and how all these medical procedures wreck havoc on her body.<br /><br />Cambell- Anna's lawyer who is hiding a secret that comes out further in the book and how this 13year old child affects his life.<br /><br />Julia-the Assigned gardium ad liteum for Anna and her past with Cambell.<br /><br />Great book- almost alittle scary because this could be a \\"real life\\" story- especially with all the modern medical technology that we have today!
0151008787|5.0|Since 1973 when I read My Michael, I have read many of the novels Oz has written since. He has become a favorite writer.  His voice, his perspective, his gentleness shine through in his work. <br /> <br />However, A Tale of Love and Darkness is absolutely stellar in every way.  It is historically fascinating and emotionally powerful -- especially the end.  <br /> <br />Whoever gives awards to books this year, should surely give this book the top prize.
B0007MVXQG|4.0|Angel of Retribution starts off in classic Priest fashion, with a quiet (but anticipatory) buildup to one of the heaviest songs of the album, \\"Judas Rising.\\"  Shades of their 80s heyday are here, but the darker work of their 70s albums is more present, with atmospheric, fluid anthemic ballads such as \\"Angel\\" and \\"Lochness,\\" right alongside rockers such as \\"Hellrider\\" and \\"Wheels of Fire.\\"  While Rob Halford's experiments with Fight and Two (and even his Halford project) were actually quite enjoyable, it's nice to have Judas Priest back together again, amazingly on a major label.  By the way, Halford's frightening wail from past albums is almost nonexistent here, so in that way the difference between the new and the old Halford-helmed Priest is the most noticable.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I enjoyed this album better than 'Hybrid Theory'. Its a short CD with 13 songs and goes for 47 mins or there abouts. But it has many great songs layered in their successful blending of rock with rap and comes out with a good effort. This is the enhanced CD version that comes out with great multimedia content. The video of 'Somewhere I Belong' was the highlight and shinoda has a great voice almost reminiscent of Aaron Lewis from Staind.<br /><br />The hit song from this album became and for good reason, 'Somewhere I Belong', it shows Linkin Park at their full potential with gritty lyrics and a delivery that is amazing. My other favourite songs from this album were 'Faint', 'Breaking the Habit' and 'Sessions'. Sessions is one of the better instrumental songs I have come across recently.
630157401X|5.0|Definitely the best of the three movies.  If you like over the top acting, lots of stunts with little plot- as some do- you'll love the second one, Temple of Doom.  If you like action movies that are like 80% of all the other action movies out there, Raiders of the lost ark has plenty of stunts for you too.  (Okay, maybe Raiders spares a tad more originality than most action films), but if you're into movies that tell a great story- as only good movies do, get this one.  The Last Crusade is one of those rare films that takes a whole bunch of genres and skillfully puts it all into one film.  It's an action film, A romance, a comedy, an adventure film- all into one.  If they had put in a little sci-fi/horror in there you'd have the whole damn video store.  It's the perfect film for when you have a bunch of people over with different tastes.  Sure to satisfy them all. <br /> <br />Not related:  Amazon should really remove some of the reviews that customers give on certain products.  There are one star reviews for this movie by people who mention scenes that aren't even in this movie... they are mistaking this film for one of the other IJones films-Temple of doom.  Just goes to show you really need to read the reviews before passing judgement.
B00004Z459|4.0|First off I was really never a fan of Linkin Park formally named Hybrid Theory. In this album debuted as simply their former name 'Hybrid Theory'the band of young men showcase their obvious talent and for a band they show their uniqueness. For they have two lead singers in Bennington and Shinoda who go so well with each other. This is the album that brought Linkin Park notice and credit.<br /><br />There are so many good songs in this 12 song album with the most noticable being One Step Closer, Crawling and In The End that begame hits and popular. I think the two strongest tracks on this CD is By Myself a rythmic dark beat and Pushing Me Away which is one of my personal favourites.<br /><br />Linkin Park is a band that successfully fuses rock and melodic rap together. Its a refreshing blend.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Well how to start..........ill just say this  cd is amazing ill give you guys a quick rating on each song.... <br /> <br />Cygnus....Vismund Cygnus: 5/5 This song is a great opener <br /> <br />The Widow: 5/5 This song just defines The Mars Volta <br /> <br />L'via L'viaquez: 4/5 a little quirky and its half spanish half english still good though <br /> <br />Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore: 3.5/5 this song is just a wired music synthesizer jam not very good but when the lyrics come its an ok song <br /> <br />Cassandra Geminni: 5/5 this song is a little over 30 minutes long, its a very good song if you have a lot of time to listen to it its got great guitar and synthesizer beats i loved it and it has a good ending <br /> <br />My favorite is Cygnus just becuase of the way its performed and everything i would definatley advise buying this if you are into emo/ prog rock
B0007GAEW6|4.0|The great thing about the Mars Volta, Is that they're doing their own thing, Not being changed by latest trends in music or the next in thing, just going out their and doing their own thing and selling records, which is a very hard thing to do. Maximum Respect. <br />This is just a brilliant album, a great listen. <br />One of the very few albums these days which is worth the price of the album. <br /> <br />Only gets 4 stars , Because im really not into listening to white noise for long periods. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This album is absolutley amazing. Like Deloused, it takes a while to digest. After about the 10th listen, I truly believe that this album is better than the last.  <br /> <br />I'm a straight-up hip-hop head, but this is the best album in the last few years. <br /> <br />You need to buy this.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|If you're a fan of The Mars Volta and were wondering if Frances The Mute would be able to build upon the great debut of De-Loused In The Comatorium, well you're expectations will not only be met but also surpassed. Frances The Mute is such a wonderful creative work of music; words cannot fully portray the experience of listening to this beautiful record!<br /><br />It's so eclectic, energetic, loose and fun just like what music was made for. There's plenty here for anyone to enjoy funk, prog-rock, salsa, jazz, english, spanish this record has it all. All 12 (originally five) tracks are amazing examples of technical proficiency, but they do it in a very loose fashion. Every track on here from Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus to Cassandra Gemini(which consists of tracks 5-12 on the record) it just leaves you in awe at what Omar, Cedric, Jon, and the guys have done on this album! So, go out and get the album. Believe me The Mars Volta have arrived and are here to stay!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I was originally reluctant to listen to this album because, in all my years, I have never heard a single Schwarz song which I liked, let alone an entire soundtrack.<br /><br />Until now.<br /><br />From the Opening \\"No One Mourns the Wicked\\" to the final bars, here is a score filled with humor, pathos, and pure soaring, hummable melody.  And the accompaniments aren't bad either.<br /><br />And of course, the performances are top-notch, as about every reviewer has recognized.<br /><br />It is destined to be a classic of the musical theatre.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This album is an orgasm for the hearing pleasure. Buy it. Now.
B000069CWE|2.0|OMG! They have totally ruined all the good stuff found on Hybrid Theory! <br />p.s. and i actally said they were my fave? Ya Right!
B0007GAEW6|5.0|In my opinion, very little music from the past few years has been any good.  While music choice is a personal decision, most people have little clue about what is in fact \\"good\\" music and what is not, as it seems every single band nowadays sounds exactly the same.   IF you are looking for something different and interesting, this is the cd to buy.  I dont care what others say about the prolonged \\"filler\\" included in this album, because there really is very little if any.  While I will not go into too much detail concerning the tracks themselves, I will say that the radio track is the weakest on the album and I usually skip over it.  Track 5 is in fact an exceptional track, and spans for over 30 minutes with very little breaks in intensity.  I found track 5 to be my favorite and despite its long play time, I have yet to find boredom in it.  Each of the other tracks span over 12 minutes, and have a different  feel to each.  IN MY OPINION THIS ALBUM IS THE BEST ALBUM THAT HAS COME OUT IN QUITE SOME TIME, AND I WOULD SUGGEST IT TO ANYONE THAT HAS AN APPRECIATION FOR EXCEPTIONAL MUSIC.  AMAZING.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I can't believe I never saw this movie. But then again, I can believe it. The only thing I can remember about this film when it was in theaters, was the stupid \\"evil bunny\\" image they used to sell the film. That image combined with the title was a complete turnoff for me. It seemed as though it was a Stephen King film, which we all know are better left unwatched.     I'm not sure how that \\"evil bunny\\" mask was representative of the film. It's a damn shame they couldn't have marketed this film better, because it's a damn good movie.    I didn't expect a lot of the things I saw, and the story was about as engrossing as anything I've ever seen. The story and the acting were compelling, and the casting was great.
B000002H2H|5.0|This album is a great follow-up to Kill 'Em All, lightning fast riffs, extremely tight bass (Cliff Burton was awesome), and not a single bad track on the album.  \\"Creeping Death\\" is a great live song, and it doesn't dissapoint on the album.  I love Cliff Burton's distorted bass intro in \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\". It is amazing, and the instrumental \\"The Call Of Ktulu\\" is excellent, considering that Megadeth's Dave Mustaine wrote it before he was kicked out of the band.  If you are a fan of thrash, or just metal in general, you will love this album.
B0007GAEW6|1.0|The Mars Volta's new album \\"Frances the Mute\\" is truly regressive rock. By 1975 punk had already declared rock of this ilk obsolete, apparently the Mars Volta did not get the memo. This band combines the worst aspects of Rush, Led Zeppelin, Hawkwind and Yes with the pitful, self hating lyrics of Korn and the Deftones. I could care less about how instumentally gifted these blokes are or how much pain they seem to be in. This album is truly wretched, derivative and pathetic. No one needs this album and I would not want to meet anyone who does.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|Here is the long awaited release by Judas Priest with the return of singer Rob Halford.....First off ..very good disc. ...Better than PAINKILLER...the guitar work of Glenn Tipton and KK Downing are superb!.... Lyrically some songs like \\"Demonizer\\" \\"Judas Rising\\" \\"Hellrider\\" have that PAINKILLER vibe to it...Fire,Hell,Demons,Fury,...which is OK but they spoonfeed it a bit... ANGEL OF RETRIBUTION has alot of bright spots too ..lots of catchy riffs from Glenn and KK like \\"Deal with the Devil\\", the first single \\"Revolution\\" \\"Wheels Of Fire\\" \\"Worth Fighting For\\" .....it's got two ballads \\"Eulogy\\" and the beautiful \\"Angel\\" which has one of the best Glenn Tipton solo's since \\"Beyond the Realms of Death\\". ....Plus there is the longest Judas Priest song ever recorded \\"Lochness\\" ...a 13 minute mammoth epic to close. .....Overall a very good Judas Priest album.
B000002U82|5.0|Okay: I know this is review no.980. Nevermind ! Every decade has its best album. I was born in 1970, so I don't know which album should be be the best of the 60's (Sergeant Pepper/Abbey Road/Pet Sounds/Electric Ladyland etcetera). My favourite 80's album is Thriller by Michael Jackson, but the best 70's album is definitely this masterpiece by Pink Floyd. I first heard it in 1988. A friend of mine played it and when Breathe started I almost thought the speakers were blown away. A few weeks later he lend his copy and I listened to it four or five times. What a great album ! To be honest: my first copy I bought in 1992: so it took awhile. But now it's one of my favourite albums ever (of the almost 2000). Why? It has a beautiful flow in it, Alan Parsons production was ahead of its time. The theme of the album is also great: e.g. before you know it you realize that you are 10 years older and closer to dead: the sun's age relatively stays the same.  <br />Dark side of the moon is definitely Pink Floyd's best, together with Wish you were here. Meddle (with Echoes) & The Wall (with Comfortably Numb) are great, but this one remains a classic. Did you know that in Germany in the 80's a recordplant only produced this title. I think that at the moment that are more cd's sold of this one than vinyl. I prefer the Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab gold disc: that's the best one. Favourite tracks: Time and Us & Them. There is only one problem when you listen to this one: you are going to realize that today's music isn't that great.
B0002OERI0|1.0|I have been a Greenday supporter for a few years now.  I have always enjoyed their kick ass songs.  However know i hate them and it is do to American idiot. i was excited a when i heared about Greenday's new album and i could'nt wait to buy it. When it was finally released i rushed to the store to pick up a copy. I brought it home and popped it into my CD player.  The album did not seem that bad until The song American Idiot.  When i heard this song i was so angry that i threw the cd out my bedroom window.  The basic meesage of that song is as follows.  I don't want to be American because Americans are all f@#*^$# idiots.  I am all for free speech but why would you bash the country yhat gives you that right. So i think that there are only three American idiots and thats Greenday! So i you hate America, everyone who lives here and everything about it buy this album if not stay away!  P.S- Oh yea and if Greenday hates our country why don't they get the hell out!!
B0000039QA|4.0|This is still one of my favorite rap albums in that Notorious B.I.G. took chances creatively on this effort.  That funky Hypnotize song put Ron Lawrence on the map as a major hit maker of R&B and hip-hop songs!  So I give Lawrence major props, not Puff Daddy, who also produced the song with Deric Angelettie.  But this album had multiple favorites such as the R. Kelly song, the aggressive What's Beef and Ten Crack Commandments.  My favorite on here is Sky's The Limit, which has that laid back 1981 feel to it as Biggie rhymes on this song.  The sample used for that song works with Biggie perfectly and 112 sounds good in their singing parts.  Every time I look at this CD in my collection, I play this song first.  Puffy and his Hitmen producers who dominated '97 with their hits are all over this album. And the other New York producers and some West coast producers are on this one too. It was risky to release this album a month after his death, but it's already a classic some 8 years later.  The later tribute albums are no contest to this one, and this is creatively better than his  gritty but street '94 debut.  This album has more of a mainstream touch, but Biggie still kept it street.  This album will be talked about by music historians because it is raw and to the core.  Biggie represented Brooklyn to the fullest on this album and his music will be remembered for a long time.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|No wait, their best since SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE!!! This is definately one of the best albums of the new millenium<br /><br />1 Rob s back! I saw JP at Ozzfest 2004 and they kicked ass!! This is a welcomed return to form for JP. Best song is \\"Juas Rising\\".
B0007GAEW6|5.0|The Mars Volta's latest album, Frances the Mute, is a masterpiece. Nothing has struck me in the way this album has in, well, forever. The album combines arty, epic, apocalyptic lyrics with arty, epic, beautiful, moody, outer space music. A classic indeed, trumps their first album, \\"De-Loused\\" slightly, another classic. If I could mention some albums this reminds me of, (though this may be misleading, because this album is the most unique piece of music I have heard in aaaaages)it would be \\"Bitches Brew\\" by Miles Davis, mixed with Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\".  Essential prog/art rock, essential music in general, this album will definitely be remembered as a milestone of music and collaboration.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|This film is brilliant,a combination of very cool action scenes with a gripping storyline.Also,the character of Lara is amazingly transfered to the movie,being tough and good-hearted at the same time,not the usual tough-looking idiot that we're sick of watching on action-films as the leading character.  I really don't get the mixed opinions by the critics,this film is(at least for me)a 100& classic(for now,four years have passed already!).
B00006RU5B|2.0|I was a huge RATM fan, and while I was shocked when they broke up, I tried to look at it as a way for the remaining members to explore different creative avenues. These three play together as well as always, and they retain their familiar style. While I wasn't expecting another RATM, the vocals here do not mesh, or blend well with the music. They seem to clash, instead of work together to make an enjoyable album. A perfect example of this is track 6, \\"Set It Off\\". The song starts out great, and I almost expect Zack to come in spitting rhymes, but instead, Cornell comes in. Instead of flowing with the song, he comes in and takes over, almost pushing his way to the forefront. In the end, maybe this album just wasn't for me.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This CD is one of the best ive ever heard!!  it blows DITC out of the water.  Its wierder more musical and just cooler.  5 songs streched over 77 minutes and the last one over a half hour its heavy listing  but well worth it
B0007N1AI6|5.0|Judas Priest is back with a vengeance!  This album picks up where \\"Painkiller\\" left off.  There's plenty of killer tunes here.  While there's a couple of songs that didn't knock me out on the first listen, the more I hear 'em, the more I like 'em!  I thought real metal had died long ago, but now that groups like Maiden, Dio, Exodus, & now Priest have returned to their old school glory, I can raise the metal flag high once again!  Heavy metal lives!!!
B0002EXH5O|5.0|I'll be the first to admit that Ive only recently (in the last 5 years) gotten into metal. I think Mudvayne was the first \\"heavy\\" band that got me away from listening to Dave Matthews band all the time. In the progress, Ive bought all of In Flames material, Shadows Fall, Killswitch Engage, half of Dark Tranquillity's catalog, Pre-Black Album metallica, Testament, Exodus, Etc... I try to sample everything.. Which brings me to R.I.P. <br /> <br />Ive got to say, the one thing that always has turned me off about Megadeth, was Dave's vocals. Something about his voice turned me off.. but damn. This album is freaking amazing. being a long time guitarist, its the first thing I look for in a band. The textures of sound are just unreal; I now see why so many people put this album up there with the classics, and its deserving.  Dawn Patrol, Hangar 18, Holy Wars... and every other track is good.  <br /> <br />Metal Heads already know this, though. so this review isnt going to help many... but if you're like me, and are still getting deeper into what metal is all about, check this out and see where some of the new-era metal bands are getting their styles; its all here.
B0007MVXQG|5.0|Do yourself a favor and buy the digipak with the bonus dvd.  I don't much care for DualDisc.  The album itself is great.  Priest is back in top form!
B0007N1AI6|5.0|First off, I have to say THIS CD IS AMAZING!!!! Old school metal the way it should be. Many bands, like KISS and Motley Crue, try a come back and fail. Not Priest. This is undoubtly the best you will get. And as for the Cranky reviewer, STICK IT!! Your opinion of this, comparing it to Jennifer Lopsided, is a joke. Why would you bother writing a review of something you know nothing about? Please in the future SHOVE IT!!
B0007OY2MG|5.0|The 3rd season of the Gilmore Gilrs rocks!!! from season 1 til now(on Tv that is, season 5) the show just gets better and better. This season with it's stormy dean and jess moments(rory and dean or rory and jess.)  and Lorelai has her problems with Rorys father Christopher.  There are great moments with all of the great characters of The gilmore world, Paris (and her friends), KIRK... There is not one episode in this season that i did not enjoy.. adn now they even come withe xtras ;)  a season to sit down and enjoy!
1400032717|5.0|This is a story of an autistic boy, told from his point of view. This could sound as a gimmick, but it's not. Christopher looks at us, 'normal' people, and he sees our drawbacks as singular beings and as a society. The fact that he tells all this in an emotionless account only stresses the point.  <br /> <br />The plot didn't hold many surprises for me, though my girlfriend said that some of the events she didn't expect at all. But it doesn't really matter, if it manages to surprise you or not. Mr. Haddon gave his hero such a strong voice, that you will be drawn to it almost magnetically. You WANT to read his story, not because of the plot, but because of the narative. This is a great strength, which is sadly missing from the majority of books published today.  <br /> <br />I would also like to mention another book, told from the autistic point of view - \\"The Speed of Dark\\"  by Elizabeth Moon. Though it is SF, which can turn some people off, it's a good book, and a worthy follow-up to \\"Dog in the Night-Time\\" if you found the theme interesting. <br />
B0007GAEW6|5.0|3/1 Has come and passed, and The Mars Volta has released their follow-up album to De-Loused in the Comatorium. First of all, for those of you who have yet to hear The Mars Volta, or even At The Drive-In, this album is a must-have. At The Drive-In was a great band, and the members that stayed together to form Mars Volta are indeed musical geniuses. The Album is a journey that will take you through every part of your mind, Its music of the higest quality. Mars Volta has yet to let me down with any of their music. Frances The Mute is an album that anyone with a good ear for amazing music will enjoy. I once read a fan's comment about the disc saying that the disc itself was \\"unattractive\\" ... Its a beautifully crafted piece of art, and the reply from a member of the comatorium was \\"It's alright... You won't see it enough... it'll be in your stereo more than you will see it.\\" And this is 110% true! The cd will not leave your stereo/cd player/whatever for a lonnnng time. <br />In general... THIS ALBUM IS A MUST HAVE AND IT IS SHEER MUSICAL GENIUS. <br /> <br />
B00005ATQD|5.0|Some films need some resting time to be watched again several years later with wide open eyes to discover new dimensions in them. « Eyes Wide Shut » in one of these. Beyond the discovery by the two main characters that love is not sex, that love is not desire, that love is not passion, that love is all these, plus something undefinable that has to do with stability, with the future, with the transcendance of sex, desire, passion into the realization of a potential that is nothing but an instinct, and especially not the survival instinct, that has to do with going beyond limits not as an adventure, as a transient exhilaration but as an infrastructural building of the psyche, the mind, the soul, the real self, the ideal of the ego. In fact this love can perfectly admit some temporary, short and unconsequential moments of oblivion and excitation that will in return enhance the real love you may feel and experience for one person. Love has nothing to do with survival and everything to do with flying into new strata of being and new skies of imagination that cannot be cut off from what precedes even if they transcend it. This film thus shows how the wife has had a transient fit of desire, satisfied or not, it does matter because it intensifies the present and the future that can come from it because it is founded on the past. The husband discovers in one wild night a rite, a ritual, another side of everyday life, the reality of every-night phantasms that may have to do with something older and more fundamental than just sex in its anonymous garb of nudity and masks that would lead some to thinking that garb is garbage when it is in fact the necessary getting rid of all taboos and limitations that liberates the participants of their constant social acting by coming back to the physical and bodily basic needs in a way. It is devilish, satanic, luciferian, with encense and blind-folded music, and yet it is the only way to be able to play one's part in a society that requires everyone to be schizophrenic just to push this society towards its future. And yet, here, we feel and taste a sense of frustration and alienation in the two main characters. This cathartic trespassing is beyond limits for them. They will never be anything but ancillary servants for those who rule the world, have the real power that commands obedience and respect. The doctor will go on living in luxury because he makes homecalls and answers summons at any time of day and night, because he solves the problems of the superior class without asking questions, without wondering about ethics, without even questioning why he should be that subservient. Is it a denunciation of this ruling class of people who can do, and have to do, what all others will never even know ? Maybe, maybe not. Is it the recognition that there is a superior group of people who have been entrusted with the ruling of the world ? By whom ? Why ? How ? And then the rest of the world, even when they know this exists, have to keep their eyes shut and ignore it. And if by any chance they happen to know or learn about it, they have to forget it and bury it under a thick layer of knowledgeable oblivion. That's probably where the film should have a sequel, an extra development. What happens when this oblivion dissolves and gives way to remembrance, memory, recollection, remembering, and even revolt or rebellion ? Midlife crisis, they call it, but is it really that rejectable ? Why shouldn't everyone have the same possibility ? Why should we, ordinary ancillary servants, who have to be schizophrenic to survive in such a world and to be creative in a way, why should we not have the same need for cathartic trespassing ? The end of the film sounds bitter in the apparently recaptured equilibrium founded on pushing the recollection of what has been discovered into the inferno of forgetfulness. What will happen when these embers start burning again, when the Lucifer of this inferno of oblivion kindles the fireof recollection again ? Who is going to emerge in the husband, Abel or Cain ? Who is going to emerge in the wife, The Queen of Sheba or Phaedra ?<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUrecollection again ? Who is going to emerge in the husband, Abel or Cain ?

B00078XGRO|4.0|Well, my topic tittle pretty much says it all.  I believe this was the best movie that the TNG crew put out for a variety of reasons. <br /> <br />For one thing, it played upon the tv series's best episodes (Best of both world 1&2).  It also featured the Borg, while they were still cool and menacing - before they were made absolutely pathetic and neutered by the Voyager series which I think was the worst of the newer Treks, even worse than Enterprise.   <br /> <br />Anyhow, the premise is your classic time travel to save the Earth from having its past altered.  Of course, it did seem silly, that the borg would go to all that trouble when technically, they should be able to take Earth quite easily if they really wanted to.   <br /> <br />Still, the story of first contact is great cannon wise, because it shows the first time humans meet the vulcans.  It's nice to see this part explained, although you will end up wondering, so, it was only because of Picard and his crew that the Federation was born?  If you start dealing with time travel, then one usually gets into the muddy parts, like how their part in the past had already happened and they were merely replaying history, so technically their winning was already decided all along. <br /> <br />The movie has plenty of action, and was pretty well directed by Jonathan Frakes.  I've seen some of his other movies, and he's a decent director, when he's given a good script and a fairly sizeable budget. <br /> <br />The Data subplot is interesting too, since it really plays out the paragon between your deepest desires and whether one has the fortitude to reject them for the good of friends.   <br /> <br />Overall, a very good movie that deserves to be in your collection, especially if you are a TNG fan.
B000001EGA|5.0|Other Elton John CDs have more hits, flash, and ear candy. If that's what you want, \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" is probably the CD for you. If, on the other hand, you want a CD that sets and maintains an introspective mood then \\"Captain Fantastic\\" is worth a closer look.    Most reviewers stress the autobiographical concept album interpretation of the CD. I'm not sure how how much you truly need to know about Elton John's and Bernie Taupin's personal lives to appreciate this music. I, for one, know very little about either man's private life and yet I rank this as my very favorite Elton John CD. Each song deals with the hardships, loneliness, and struggles of young professionals on the road to success - and I identify strongly with many of the sentiments expressed here, although I am not a pop songwriter. Anyone who has enjoyed a fruitful professional relationship that blossoms into true collaboration and friendship will understand what Elton is singing about. The album's finale, \\"Curtains\\", is one of the prettiest songs about friendship that I have ever heard.    The music works for me due to the tasteful playing and arrangements. On some tracks, Elton supplements his piano playing with both the harpischord and mellotron. But rather than treating us with typical mellotron bombast as the Moody Blues would, Elton uses the instrument in a very supportive role. As a result, this is one of the few times I've heard a mellotron that didn't scream for my attention. Throughout, Elton cares more for overall orchestration than grandstanding.    The bonus tracks are a pleasure to have, and don't detract from the album's overall mood. Elton's cover of \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" is a terrific arrangement that redefines the psychedelic tune into a moody rocker. I prefer his cover of John Lennon's \\"One Day at a Time\\" to Lennon's original.    \\"Captain Fantastic\\" leaves you wanting more. Sadly, Elton's music was about to change direction . . .
B0007O38F8|5.0|I gave this album 5 stars to even out for the ridicilous 1 star posts.
B00076ZZ84|2.0|Supposedly, this contains the album in 'enhanced' stereo.  Well guess what?  It's 16bit/48khz.  Cds are 16bit/44.1khz.  It sounds EXACTLY the same as the cd layer, and I'm willing to bet that it is from the exact same cd master.  There is NO surround mix either.  Pathetic.
B0007GAEW6|1.0|wow!  it's amazing how one of the most incredible bands of the last decade (At The Drive-In) split into two halves, with each turning to complete garbage after only 2 albums apiece.  sparta's first album, \\"wiretap scars,\\" was pretty good (pushing the catchy punk side of ATDI), and mars volta's first album, \\"deloused in the comatorium,\\" was just amazing (pushing the prog-experimental side of ATDI.  this was one of my favorite albums of the last 5 years, hands down).  well, no surprise with sparta's second album, \\"porcelain,\\" they went even further into pop-crap territory and basically lost my attention forever.  similarly, with \\"frances the mute,\\" mars volta have gone even further into prog-crap territory, and i fear, have probably lost my attention forever as well. <br /> <br />ATDI you will be missed.  sorry but this album is f*cking awful.  only a few meager bits (and i mean, a couple sparse minutes here or there) of compelling music doesn't cut it for me.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I don't know what some of the reviews are talking about because this album is friggin'  GENIUS.  It's absolutely ridiculous how intelligent these guys are to create this music.  No one can do that?  They are the new Pink Floyd/ Led Zeppelin of our day. The guitar work is so crazy but good.  They just invented a whole new type of musical composition. Pretty damn original if you ask me.  It is truly an orgasm to the hears.   10 stars!!!!!
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Gilmore Girls is the smartest and the most fun i see on Tv each week and the Dvd sets are amzing and great to have. KUdos to the cast and Crew for such a great show and i hope they keep up the good work.
B0007GADZO|5.0|I am deeply impressed with Steve Vai's Real Illusions. The album is definitely different than traditional Vai albums like Passion and Warfare, Fire Garden and Alien Love Secrets, but it will take you in for a ride Vai's never taken you on before. This album has a good blend of Vaiesque metal, soulful vocals, grand orchestration and of course, crazy effects (that Vai loves showing off). You also get to see many sides of Vai here; the child, the adult, the composer and the spirit. I recommend this album to all music fans that need to hear a fresh, never heard before album.     Peace, Love and good happiness stuff.     EDIT: Update as of May 21st. I LOVE THIS ALBUM!!! Steve Vai is truly a Guitar God.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|A great second season for the girls and a season that has everything to look forward to. Great introduction to Jess and the whole love trangle between him, Rory and Dean. This was another great Dvd box set and i can't wait for the next one to come out.
B0007GAEW6|2.0|No disrespect to the Amazon users praising this album left and right, but quite frankly I think they're all misguided.  The Mars Volta really missed the mark this time out.  As another reviewer pointed out, this is a complete 180 from De-Loused, one of the greatest albums in recent years in my opinion.  That's not neccesarily a bad thing, nor is it a surprise, but the end result is disappointing nonetheless. <br /> <br />Omar's gone off the deep end, friends.  This man never met a jam he didn't like--funk, rock, salsa, jazz-fusion, whatever.  If it's music and it's interminable, he's up for it.  Which has resulted in Frances The Mute, 77 minutes of cut-and-paste noodling, doodling, tinkering, and what-have-you.  The cohesion, the focus, the intensity of De-Loused is G-O-N-E.  In retrospect, we probably have Rick Rubin to thank for that wondrous final product last time out.  On Frances, what we're left with are miles of tape devoted to half-baked grooves that all blur together.  The only semblance of order is provided by a willfully misleading tracklisting. <br /> <br />It's not that I can't handle the music the band is attempting here, it's that it just doesn't work they way they want it to.  Omar is an incredibly gifted musician but he's not Miles Davis (much of this album sounds like an attempt to replicate Silent Way/Jack Johnson-era Miles).  He's out of control.  The man's got the technical skill and the guts, but discipline will have to come in time. <br /> <br />Two points for the talent and for trying.  Cross your fingers for album #3.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|The \\"Chariot\\" album is good, as a stand-alone piece. But the acoustic version of the album, \\"Stripped\\" is by far a throw-back to the days of pre-MTV, before image ruled everything, and when it was only about the music. The songs are lyrically meaningful, the musicality of the album is dead on and DeGraw's vocals are not only thoughtful, but soulful.<br /><br />I've had the fortune of seeing DeGraw live and this album captures that spirit.<br /><br />I'm hoping this sets a trend for pop music, because let's face it, for the past 8-10 years, it has become something that didn't necessarily require talent.<br /><br />DeGraw is a raw, shining star in a music landscape that has generally been dull and glossed over.
B0007GAEW6|2.0|The sad thing about the Mars Volta is that it's painfully obvious that they have talent. The actual techncial skills displayed on \\"Frances the Mute\\" is outstanding. It takes more than great technical skills to make a good album, thankfully, and this album (unfortunately) is a good example of that. <br /> <br />\\"Frances\\" finds the Mars Volta throwing in more experimental elements. It feels like they were taking bong hits and saying, \\"Hey, lets do something experiemental!\\" without any further fleshing out of the idea. It's highly distressing that this so called \\"experiementalism\\" is getting passed off as growth and maturity. <br /> <br />The cd as a whole rings hollow. Nothing about it shouts out for it to be listened to more than once. That is what makes \\"Deloused\\" a better cd... while it wasn't a great album by any means, it had something to it that made you want to listen to it every now and again. \\"Frances\\" completely lacks that interaction with the listener. <br /> <br />Buy it or don't. I don't care. This album is bound to top many a critic's year end best of lists. The Mars Volta has some interesting sounds happening, they just need to learn how to harness them into one, cohesive package.
B0002OERI0|5.0|So they didn't win album of the year because Ray Charles died.  That's fine.  Let me say this:  American Idiot is by far the best album I have heard all year.  Comparing it to Ray Charles is obviously like comparing apples to oranges, so I will not even begin to try.  I have never been a huge Green Day fan.  In fact, I only own Dookie (on casette nonetheless).  But I was a fan of the first single, the title track, and bought the album.  Since that day it has been playing almost non-stop on my iPod and in my car's CD player.  It really is that good.  Of course I wouldn't listen to someone I didn't know either, but this is still the best album I can recommend right now.   <br /> <br />On a side note, there are a couple of fools reviewing on here.  One claiming that because of the song \\"American Idiot\\" they are no longer a Green Day fan and threw the CD out the window.  The other saying that if you think \\"American Idiot\\" is anti-American, you probably have a \\"support our troops\\" bumper sticker.  American Idiot is not calling all American's idiots, it is simply commenting on the hysteria created by the media, and how willing many Americans are to lap it up.  That's fine, you don't have to like that song.  But the reviewer said they liked the album up until the point where they heard that song... which I find interesting since it's the first song on the CD.  Clearly a Greenday hater with no real oppinion of any value.  To the other guy:  what's wrong with supporting our troops?  Or showing some solidarity through something as simple as a bumper sticker?  Regardless, you both are American Idiots.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|This CD is very, very good....the DVD is worth the purchase in of itself. Surprise!!! there is a 12 minute epic as the last track.
B0006Z2LH4|3.0|Also known as CUBE 3: ZERO (2004).   This is the third film in the CUBE film series.  The first film,[[ASIN:6305238065 Cube]] (1998) was a popular favorite on the SCI-FI Channel.  Followed by the sequel,[[ASIN:B00008DDVY Cube 2 - Hypercube]] (2002).  This third film is actually considered a &#34;prequel&#34;.  The story is set before the CUBE (1998) storyline.  However, to fully appreciate and enjoy the CUBE films, you should see CUBE (1998) first, then CUBE 2: HYPERCUBE (2002) and this this third film [[ASIN:B0006Z2LH4 Cube Zero]] (2004).   Instead of the film starting off with a victim in a lighted room with trapdoors, the walls are solid metal.  We are introduced to two men in a control room.  On a tv monitor, they see kidnapped victims in a Cube room.  Their demise is recorded and filed by Wynn (Zachary Bennett).  The other control worker, Dodd (David Huband) is strict-by-the-book.  he tells Wynn he should not look inside the files.  Don't get involved.  Just keep the video input on real-time.  We discover that these two control men are also victims, but are allowed to work in this control room.  Someone gives them food pills for dinner from an elevator door. Wynn is a whiz at chess.  He can see all the moves in his head before he plays.  Dodd becomes so uptight and bossy that Wynn tells him that his worry is from being scared that anytime he is going to wake up and find himself inside the Cube too.   This story gets more interesting all the time.   DVD includes: A 19-minute featurette, &#34;Inside The Box: the making of Cube Zero&#34;, conceptual art, storyboard comparisons and a forgettable music video.
B0007NFL18|2.0|Its not worth buying. this is exactly why people bootleg cds. dont get me wrong, there are some songs that i would defenitly bump in the jeep, but like i said there are some...and there are about 20+ songs on this cd. I like a cd i can listen to all the way thru instead of skipping thru trax. If your looking for a good cd go grab The Games new sh*t... nicely done. Thats a cd I \\"actually\\" bought. im going to be honest with you. just download the new 50 <br /> <br />
B00004U28G|4.0|This is one of those wacky 70's movies with an all-star cast that became almost a staple of the time. With Burt Reynolds, Dom Deluise, Sammy Davis, Jr., Dean Martin, and Jack Elam in the starring roles, it served up some very funny comedy that I was surprised to find still holds up today. There are so many stars from previous years and decades in the movie that it's almost like they're getting together for one last silver screen reunion before retiring to rest on their laurels. The fact that the movie is one big farce and they probably didn't take it that seriously, either, probably helped, since it looks like everyone is having an uproariously good time while doing it. Some of the antics date the movie a bit, but still, it's all in good fun, and apparently the movie is based on real races that were popular at the time, although highly illegal.<br /><br />I was pleased to see Elam get considerable screen time here. He was a real trooper who served tirelessly in supporting roles all his life and was always a class act even when he was a disreptuable bad guy (which he  was most of the time). I remember Jack Elam most from the opening scene at the train station in Once Upon a Time in the West, but here he gets probably his funniest role as a wayward proctologist who's always brandishing his middle finger, causing the other actors to back away in fear, which was always good for a laugh. In the Once Upon a Time scene, I read that they smeared watermellon juice on his face to get the flies buzzing around his head to do that scene. His famous wall-eyed visage only made  the doctor role funnier. Deluise, \\"the fat man who make everyone feel good,\\" also gets one of his funniest parts. All in all, still a fun movie sporting many of the most famous shining lights of previous Hollywood decades.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|The Defenders of the Metal Faith Judas Priest are back and Screaming for Vengence!  It's been 15 long years since the Metal Gods of old from across the Atlantic released \\"Painkiller\\".  Angel of Retribution reminds me of a cross between Glenn Tipton's 1997 release Baptism of Fire and Rob Halford's 2000 release Resurrection.  This album is must have for old school fans and new alike.
B0007NFL18|1.0|I'm sure this will sell millions of CDs but that still doesn't make it good. I'm sure radio will play it into the ground while other, more talented artists are ignored.<br /><br />What a shame.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|X2 is a great movie, and this DVD is loaded with extras.  I waited way too long to finally take a look at this film.<br /><br />Director Bryan Singer did a great job, even better than the first X-Men, creating a movie that even people who know nothing about the X-men comic books will enjoy.  This movie draws the viewer right into the plot and keeps them on the edge of their seat.  The fight scenes are amazing, the characters have addictive personalities, and the story flows at just the right pace.<br /><br />Charles Xavier/Prof. X is played, of course and once again, by Patrick Stewart.  His character really doesn't have a lot of EXCITING parts, but the X-Men need a leader, and he fits the bill.  Stewart is very believable in this role.  We may see a little too much of him though, since the other characters are so much more interesting.<br /><br />Logan/Wolverine is played by Hugh Jackman.  He is absolutely perfect in his part.  I can't picture anyone else playing Wolverine.  His character only has a few moments that fall a little short of believable, like when he is seeking out William Stryker's hideout but doesn't think about the fact that it might be underground - even though the mutant school has a plane under the basketball court...go figure.  The other part that left me scratchin' my head was when the kids at mutant high store their Coke and Pepsi in a non-refrigerated cabinet even though they have a gi-normous refrigerator in the kitchen.  This was added to the script just to have Ice Man / Bobby Drake show his chillin' powers.  Scenes like that did not need to be forced into the movie - the viewers are not morons.  Other than those two very small mistakes, I found the scriptwriting for Wolverine to be better than I could have ever dreamed!  Zak Penn and David Hayter know how to write!  Great job, guys.<br /><br />Ian McKellen plays Eric Lensherr/Magneto.  He is fantastic in his role.  I really believe this guy thinks he is a mutant!<br /><br />Halle Berry manages to hole her own as Storm/Ororo Munroe, but I think she could have pushed a little more spice into her character.  Better than Cat---, oh, I won't even go there....<br /><br />Famke Janssen is very believable as Jean Grey, but how exciting is it to watch mind-powers?  It would have been cool to see her in more action scenes, like tossing people around with tele-whatever.<br /><br />James Marsden plays Scott Summers/Cyclops.  I never realized how hard it is to relate to a character when you can't see their eyes.  He did a great job in a part where you can't tell where the heck he is looking!  That cannot be an easy role.  Maybe I should ask Jamie Foxx how tough it is?<br /><br />Anna Paquin nails the role of Rogue.  She was absolutely born to play that role.  Talk about a comic book character coming to life - she did just that.<br /><br />Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is Mystique from this day forward.  She could almost jump this movie to an R rating.  Mutants aren't all bad. :-)<br /><br />William Stryker is played by Brian Cox.  What a jerk!  I think that is what he was going after, so good show ole' chap.<br /><br />Alan Cumming plays Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler, one of the most memorable roles I have ever seen.  Man, this guy is one of THE best actors in the world today.  The directing, the acting, and the stunts involved with Nightcrawler are superb.  Everyone involved with the development and end-result of this character should pat themselves on the back.  I was totally impressed!<br /><br />Yuriko Oyama/Deathstrike is played by Kelly Hu.  Hu really grabs the screen at first knuckle crack!  She has that IT factor so many stars strive for.  She fit the role of Deathstrike better than the orignal concept turned out.  You rock, Kelly!<br /><br />The plot is pretty simple:  Bad guy hates mutants, he wants them to be blamed for an attack on the president, the mutants find out the truth, and both sides are trying to stop the other before it is too late.  Some times, simpleworks best!  Like in X2's case.<br /><br />X2 DVD deliver the goods.  Bryan Singer is an amazing director, gifted with the ability to make films that go beyond the usual expectations.<br /><br />See ya next review.or, gifted with the ability to make films that go beyond the usual expectations.

B0007O38F8|5.0|Some of these people really amaze me with their overly critical reviews of the 50 cent album. As if any of you could do a better job, as if any of you could sell 11 million with a debut album. NO Y'ALL CAN'T. So if the album doesn't do anything for you, that's fine. But please stop acting like the Siskel and Eabert of the music world, because quite frankly, y'all are overanalyzing. I think its a fun album, 50 is fun period. It's something anyone who liked the 1st album would like listening to (excluding those who have the need to feel important by overanalyzing).
B0000CFW87|5.0|This CD is one of the best I have ever heard. I love the new mix of music that Josh is doing, the songs that he picked really go well with his voice. And then there is the 3 songs he wrote, well they are some of the best on the CD. They are \\"Remember When it Rained\\", \\"Per Te\\" and \\"Never Let Go\\". I say never let go to the reason you are buying the CD.

B0007GAEW6|3.0|This new 77 minute release from the Mars Volta is truly a strange piece of work. With it's odd track listing, and 4 minutes of silent background noise between each song, it most definitely does not compare to the previous Deloused in the Comatorium, a remarkable work of genius. Almost every aspect of the music seems to be lacking on this album. Cedric's vocal stylings, for one, have gone from wildly switching inhuman octaves between catchy harmonies and melodies, to being generally more dull, monotoned, and boring. Omar's guitar playing suggests that he may have been spending more time tweaking nobs than actually trying to come up with good riffs and melodies this time around, and generally, the song structures are quite dull. Although the opening track \\"Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus\\" seems to be pretty well constructed giving off a sense of pre-frances volta lingering in the air, the album takes a dive after the single \\"The Widow\\" as we descend into lengthy silences filled with computer blips and white noise, followed only by songs such as \\"L'via, L'viaquez\\" which basically takes on a long drawn out and repetitive structure, as though you have the same two minute song constantly on repeat. As we then enter into another more lengthy phase of static humming (approximately 4 minutes into track 4), we are introduced to the next short episode of song, \\"Miranda, that Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore\\". Although the melodies are beautiful and the song is quite catchy, it lacks diversity and transition, and basically takes on a structure much like that of \\"L'via\\" (verse/chorus/verse/chorus/chorus).  The next half of the album is basically a long drawn out, 30 minute jam session that is nothing too exciting, but ofcourse you listen to it, cause hey...its the Mars Volta. <br /> <br />Over all it think that they could have done a much better job with this album, but I will continue to listen to it and try to appreciate it more. You could argue that I am not opening my mind to the artistic nature of this release, and that I'm narrowminded and trendy. And I might agree. This album is not a bad album. In fact, it's a good album. Just don't expect it to be in ANY WAY nearly as great as comatorium was.  <br /> <br />Three stars, because 3/5 of this CD is basically not music.  <br />
B0002VHBTK|5.0|This movie is pure genius and as such will not appeal to everyone.  The driving force of this movie is choices.  Little choices and big choices can have untold effects on one's life and the lives of others.  That is what this movie is about. <br /> <br />To get these ideas across, we meet Lola and her current boyfriend.  They are shady characters in that they are involved in illegal activities.  Lola is the real thinker and the one who maintains control.  Lola is late and the boyfriend gets in trouble.  He gets scared and loses the money he is supposed to deliver to a drug lord.  He has twenty minutes until delivery time.  He turns to Lola.  She has twenty minutes to come up with the money and get to him. <br /> <br />Lola runs.  She runs and runs.  Her mind races for solutions even as her feet race across the city.  She interacts with a number of characters.  Some of these are affected by her and we get glimpses of their futures.  There are two pauses in the film where Lola and her boyfriend are discussing important issues.  In the first, Lola asks if he loves her.  In the second he asks what she would do if he dies.  While these at first seem strange ways of dividing the film's three separate sections, they give great insight into the characters. <br /> <br />As the film progresses, we also get to see what can happen when some of the choices that were made are changed.  What new paths can occur.  Who get affected.  All in all, it is simply brilliant.

B000056BOR|5.0|Doris Day's day starts off badly when she is drenched by a passing limo.  She gets angry but does not know the limo passenger (Cary Grant) feels bad and wishes to make amends.  Later Grant spots Day from his office and sends Gig Young to make sure she is all right and taken care of.  Day's roommate (Audrey Meadows) is her self-appointed protector of her virtue. <br /> <br />Things quickly move forward when Grant and Day first meet face to face and fall in love.  Small-town Day is not sure what to make of millionaire Grant at first as he tries to whirl her off her feet.  It is obvious that Grant is trying for more than Day is willing to give out (at least at this stage) and events unfold hilariously. <br /> <br />The plot twists and situations would be at home in a Frank Capra movie.  The dialogue is snappy and full of innuendo.  Day's character even has far more depth than Meadows suspects.  Although she comes from upstate New York, she manages to hold her own both against and with Grant.  It all culminates wonderfully in a way few comedies manage.  A must see for fans of classic stars and comedies.

The downside is that it provides a rather discouraging perspective for career women about achieving a balance between work and family. <br />I think more than the women, men should be reading this one!  <br />The book definitely struck a chord with me!!!
B000005Z0E|5.0|Tupac is the best rap ever . This has his best hits. Worth price. Hits like I Don't Give a F****,Brenda's Got a Baby, and Rebel of the Underground. I give his album 5 out of 5.
B000000XB9|5.0|Creedence Clearwater Revival churned out so many great cuts that even a \\"20 Greatest Hits\\" compilation is not enough to cover them all. Yet, for a starter \\"Chronicle, vol. I\\" is by far the best bet. Coupled with vol. II it is unbeatable. <br />Essential listening.
B000084T18|5.0|50 cent is the new breed of rappers. Hits like in da club,What Up Gangsta,Patiently Waiting , and P.I.M.P.. I give it 5 out of 5.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|I originally saw this film in the theatre, and after having bought this particular package, I have to say it's a much better movie with the extra footage.<br /><br />If you watch the both versions back to back, the omissions are glaring in the theatrical cut.  The film would likely have garnered more Oscars than nominations had this footage been in the theatrical release.<br /><br />No matter, for those of us who have a love-hate relationship with the DVD industry, this is one director's cut that justifies the format in every single way.  Oh, did I mention the performances?<br /><br />From top to bottom, everything about this movie is perfect.  From the casting to the editing, from the music selection to the writing, there isn't a weak link in the chain.  Cameron Crowe seemingly goes from strength to strength, and this film represents the pinnacle of his life as a filmmaker.<br /><br />Although I grew up with a big crush on Drew Barrymore, I have to say that Kate Hudson (at least in this role) was MADE for the big screen.  Hopefully she'll get more dramatic parts, but I have a feeling this will be the crowning gem in her career.  She's absolutely luminous, and has you alternately saddened and infatuated at various times throughout the movie.<br /><br />Frances McDormand is also stellar in her supporting role; she gets the biggest laughs.  Just when I thought Crowe wouldn't be able to top \\"Say Anything\\", he pulls this one out of thin air.  Stunning.
B0000039QA|5.0|Big is One of best Rapper ever. Its tough decision him and tupac, I chose tupac first. but big has hits like Hypnotize,Notorious Thugs,and Kick in the Door. I give his album 5 out of 5.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|Several of my friends who saw this film agree that it was Julia's finest dramatic performance. I felt her performance was nuanced and pitch-perfect. Clive Owen was superb, and Natalie Portman's performance was a revelation. The views we get of London reflect the iciness and aloofness of the characters. The only real weakness lay in Jude Law's performance. There's no disputing his physical beauty. In that regards he is a suitable component in this group of four actors. I found it difficult to believe that Julia's character would be drawn to somebody who seemed so lackluster and weak. In another actor's hands I believe the characterization would have been handled differently. Mike Nichols did a fine job directing this otherwise amazing cast in a biting commentary on the hopeful beginnings and devastating endings of relationships.
B00005AQF7|5.0|Snoop has some of the best hair style ever.He is a hit maker and big time Pimp. Hits are Gin and Juice,Who Am I? (What's My Name) ?,Murder Was the Case and Doggy Dogg World. I give it a 5 out of 5.
B000683VI4|5.0|I am completely in love with this movie. (I didnt think it was a tear jerker) The characters are well thought out...and the storyline is very cliche- but still well told.
B0007O38F8|5.0|50 cent broke sell records with his cd. He going to do it agian. Because the He talks about everyone on his album. How can you talk about this album ,when its not even out. so you don't know if it is going to be or bad. I think going to be better last album. What I read from MTV.com , Track call piggy bank , he talk about fat joe,nas,jadakiss,who I think sucks. Fans of those artist will want to buy this album to see what he says about them.So you are not throw your money down the toliet.hip_hop_is_life Scientists don't know about rapping that they are scientists. Plus great songs are going to be on this cd. Disco Infenro and Candy shop. The_Entity_of_One , you are so wrong, 50 cent has 4.5 million house. It use to Mike Tyson's house. that takes guts to buy Mike tyson's house. so there. when I get 50 cents' ablum I will give it 5 out of 5.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Whoever the snatch is that rated this cd a 1 obviously has no idea whatsover what good music is.  Aside from that, if you liked the first cd, that cd holds no comparison to the perfection bestowed upon this cd. Buy it.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Eminem is greatest whiteboy rapper ever. he better than buddy spark or another jerk.Hits like The Real Slim Shady, I'm Back,Stan, The Way I Am and Criminal. I give it 5 out of 5.
B0006Z2KX4|5.0|I am not a film critic so I don't have a lot of coments on the films techincal qualities or insights to the director. I just know that when my family watched this movie we laughed out loud continually.  <br /> <br />I have been waiting for 3 years to purchase it till it was out on DVD. Don't be afraid of the black & white or the date the film was made. This film transends all that.  <br /> <br />If you love Cary and Hepburn, you WILL love this movie!
B000002WPI|5.0|The one of the best rap group ever and one of the first after Run DMC.Hits likesWu-Tang: 7th Chamber,Clan in da Front and Method Man. I give it 5 out of 5.
B0007O38F8|1.0|Oh Boy, Where Do I Start, Well He's Taking About Women, Club's, Car's, Bragging That He Has Money, And Like Nobody Care's. 50 Cent's New Cd Is Just So Old Material, I Mean Wow, Who Hasn't Talked About Jewelry, Having A Big House, Or He Got Shot 9 Times, Who Care's. This Album Was Just A Big Hype For 50 Cent To Sell A Crappy Album Just To Get Fast Bucks. And That Candy Shop Song: Haha Funny, The Only People That Hear, And Like These Type Of Song's Are Little New Age Kid's That Are In The Age Of 9 To 15. And In The Video Of Candy Shop: What Kind Of Idiot Raps While He's Having Sex, I Mean Come On Thats Just Plain Stupid. The Only Thing That 50 Cent Is Doing, Is Just That His Career Is Going To A Ludacris, Lil Jon, Ying Yang Twins Routine, Which Is Pathetic, And Weak.
B0002X314C|5.0|First, John Legend has talent beyond his youthful 26 years. Not many can compete on this level. And it's too bad that some have a hard time appreciating someone with his style and sound. This album isn't a throwback to some other time, it's just John Legend being John Legend. This is who he is. This album is refreshing and original. He's not copying anyone. You're not going to find songs like LIVE IT UP, STAY WITH YOU, or I CAN CHANGE on anyone else's album. Not in this lifetime. This is about as vibrant and brilliant as R&B can get. This album is classic.
B0007O38F8|5.0|50 cents The Massacre is a very good album. 50 is deffintaley on top of his game right now and this album proves it.  The song that I think is the best so far is Hate It Or Love It Remix (feat. G-Unit) because it fts. all of g-unit and how tight they r ( except game who was dropped from g-unit last night). The other song that I am felling is Build You Up because it was prodused by Jaime Foxx and he is so talented right now and that 50 went to him and included him on his album. Simply put The Massacre is deffinatley worth buying it might not live up to Get Rich Or Die Tryin but it is nearly impossible to top 11 million in record sales.  <br /> <br />Also Murder Inc. dosn't stand a chance against G-Unit/Shady Aftermath
B00009ZYBY|1.0|You see less of Gianina Facio in this DVD than in theatre. Railly Scott selfishly deleted his girlfriend's scenes. The horribly murdered wife and son were an ever-lasting wound in the Roman general's mind. Now Facio's scenes were cut, you can hardly see the drives in Maximus' revenge. <br />
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Frances the Mute by the Mars Volta in my opion is the single best album that I have ever listend to.  This music hits everypart that you want it to, it has its slow points that drag you in and make you comfortable then a rapid tempo change and the drums go off and the music instatley changes in a split second.  The trumpet and orchestra parts just add so much to the album that if they weren't there it would be complete. I also enjoy the spanish in the beging of L' Via L' Viaquez it really captuvates the listners and wants you begging for more <br /> <br />Simply put best album ever the Mars Volta really had to try hard to cap De-Loused In The Comatorium but they sure did it with Frances the Mute and then some.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I've seen the stage version twice (traveling company) and the movie twice.  I preferred the film version, for the following reasons:<br /><br />The movie explained the 'back story'.  You see where the Phantom came from, why he grew from a tortured young boy into what he became.<br /><br />The set design was fantastic!  It helped open up the story by having a view of the building, the staircase, the upper reaches of the theater.  It's sort of unfair not being limited by a stage, but the director used the full ability of the big screen to offer a wonderful view of the insular world of the Paris opera.<br /><br />The casting was good, better than the traveling company, IMO.  Emmy Rossum WAS young, but fit the story and of course she is a talent for the future.  Gerard Butler was superb as the Phantom, Patrick Wilson OK as the wimpy Raoul.<br /><br />Switching back and forth from 'modern' era and earlier was very effective; tied the story together better.<br /><br />The singing was excellent, and the set design/art direction much better than that!  The movie did win three Academy Award nominations, after all, which is impressive as most films don't get an Oscar nod.<br /><br />I've pre-ordered this film and eagerly await its arrival.  I'm thinking about FINALLY getting that big screen HDTV so I can enjoy more of a movie house feel to it (I already have the home theater setup).  I've also ordered (and received) the soundtrack.<br /><br />This is my favorite movie of 2004.  Highly recommended!
B0007GAEW6|5.0|...was the only reaction i had at first listen. <br /> <br />deloused in the crematorium BLEW ME AWAY as i had never heard anything like it.  it still rests as one of my favorite cds, and frances the mute is totally on par with the wonderment that was deloused in the crematorium. <br /> <br />the mars volta has an outstanding capability to blend any sort of music you can think of all at once into one crazy, epic, story-telling piece of art and to constantly captivate the listener.  frances possesses the prog rock flavor of yes and combines it with some pretty crazy womb imagery and some fantastic lyrics. <br /> <br />the reason i love the mars volta is that they don't sound like anyone else.  these guys have some incredible talent.  cedric zavala's voice reaches heights previously achieved only by mariah carey - but about 3987235829 times more eerie and exciting, not to mention talented. <br /> <br />frances the mute will take you on a ride through the almost nightmarish world the mars volta has created.  definitely worth your money!!
B0001L3MI0|4.0|I've seen ID4 about six times.  I've got the DVD, and, you know, it's still an enjoyable film to watch.  Yep, when you've seen a film a half-dozen times, you know what's going to happen, but when you watch it that sixth time, you are interested to see how well you remember it.  And you get to enjoy the parts you liked before, again.  I'm waiting for the explosions, for the fighter vrs. alien dogfight (OK, it's hard to believe the aliens can conquer the galaxy, but can't hit the broad side of the barn with their advanced weapons), for President Pullman to fight back, and so on.  \\"Welcome to Earth\\" indeed!<br /><br />It's an entertaining flick that is enjoyable time and again.  I'm a big Jeff Goldblum fan, and he does his off-kilter bumbling genius schtick again, and really well.  Will Smith is a winning personality, though you wonder how his ego would fare in the modern military...And a positive nod to Randy Quaid, you turns a potentially hokey role into a pretty good performance.<br /><br />Yeah, it ain't Hamlet (big surprise) but compared with its action film cousins, ID4 comes off pretty darn well.<br /><br />Just remember, don't get on top of that skyscraper in LA and hold up a sign welcoming the aliens.  Might just irritate them!<br /><br />Recommended if you like action flicks that are a cut above average.
B0007NFL18|1.0|the massacre from 50 cent is as bad as his first one. that's it im not getting more 50 cent albums. because 50 cent your time is up.
B0006213H6|5.0|I agree that this album is not for everybody. Alot of Von deals in spacy atmospheres and there is very little music in the strictest sense. However, it warrants at least a run through for most people, especially those interested in Sigur Ros. (Hint: This album is alot like the BABA/TIKI/DIDO EP, if you didn't like that, you probably won't enjoy this very much.) But anywho, onto the songs. <br /> <br />\\"Sigur Ros\\" opens the album with a series of shrieks and unnerving sounds. It really sets the tone for the rest of the album. It is followed by the beautiful \\"Dogun,\\" a very spacy song featuring a beginning that will take you away. \\"Hun Jord\\" is an album highlight. It was the first song I ever heard from this album, and afterwards I knew I had to hear more. (btw, forgive my neglect to use Icelandic characters in my typing) A little further down the stretch we come to \\"Myrkur,\\" which is a truly fascinating tune that takes the angelic choruses of \\"Hun Jord\\" to a more fast paced level. \\"Hafssol\\" is an extensive track but is very interesting. The song's length hints at what will come on later Sigur Ros albums, particularly ( ). \\"Von\\" is a great song, another highlight. \\"Syndir Guds\\" is also great and a great end (kind of) to the album.  <br /> <br />In closing, this is a very exclusive album. Those looking for the more structured music of \\"Ageatis\\" or the orchestral backings of ( ) will probably be dissapointed. Remember to expect nothing when it comes to Von, because there is alot to be discovered. <br /> <br />Highlights: Hun Jord, Myrkur, Von <br />Lowlights: Verold Ny Og Od, Mistur, 18 sekundur fyrir solaruppras (which is basically 18 seconds of silence)
B00005JNBQ|2.0|Napoleon Dynamite was a great movie in theaters. It was original and completely pointless, and best of all, about five people in the whole world knew about it. But this all changed when it came out on DVD. It was advertised on MTV and probably your local cable provider, so you didn't have to go all the way to your local underground movie theater to see it. Lucky you! And now you can repeat all the same catch phrases over and over again to annoy all your classmates and suck all the fun out of the movie. Good job. A perfectly genius movie down the tubes all because mainstream America had to get its greasy little claws all over it.

0671015206|5.0|Quiet capitalism provides a more effective and stronger foundation for society than unrealistic communist idealogy.<br /><br />This book points out the truth that is so often overlooked in today's society: you can indeed live a comfortable retirement on your wage; your financial security is largely based on your ambition, determination, and discipline. The book in question puts this in terms that a \\"peasant\\" can understand. A \\"peasant-class\\" individual could gain security, afford to educate his children, and thus benefit society in general by following the guidelines in this book.<br /><br />M. Veiluva \\"sputnik99\\", author of the review \\"The Capitalist Exploiter Leech Next Door\\" of this book on 2/18/05 would have you feel guilty for realizing the full potential that was intended for ambitious, ordinary workers in a free market society. I am a \\"cog in the machine\\" of capitalism; I worked hard in your beloved academia and then put those skills to work in the real world. In the end, this Stanley capitalism minimizes my drain to society and maximizes my contributions, financial and otherwise.<br /><br />In fact, it is those that neglect the basics Stanley illustrates in his book who end up being \\"leeches.\\" One person's fiscal irresponsibility costs the next man, indirectly or directly. Consider how we are required to pay for \\"uninsured motorist coverage\\" because of those who will not pay auto insurance, frivolous lawsuits, exploitation of government programs, etc. These things all have a negative effect on the cost of goods, services, and the overall quality of life.<br /><br />The self-titled \\"academician\\" would have you believe that his long hours of reading Marxist history and his pompous use of large words make him something of an authority, better equipped than you to judge the effectiveness of this book. In a sense, he who speaks out against a \\"class system\\" is perpetuating an invisible, sub-concious class system where he can feel superior to the average Amazon.com customer.<br /><br />You see, in the Soviet Union, a peasant was just a peasant. He may eat, he may have health care, he may retire, or he may be murdered by Stalin. The author of this book intends to encourage the \\"peasant\\" (and yes, M. Veiluva intends to put you down with that term) to find his financial potential through basic and prudent fiscal decisions.<br /><br />By the way, if Stanley is so wrong, and the book is exploitative propaganda, why has classic Marxism failed so miserably when put into practice in the real world with the imperfections intrinsic to humans? Veiluva himself proves that even a socialist desires to be better than the next man. This book can truly help you find a mindset for fiscal responsibility that will reduce stress in the later years of your life.azon.com customer. <br /> <br />You see, in the Soviet Union, a peasant was just a peasant.

B0000AUHPG|5.0|Sergio Leone. Just hearing that name sends a thrill through the hearts of cinema fans everywhere--or at least it should. This Italian director only made a handful of films during his career, but nearly every one of them is a masterwork on an epic scale. Obviously, the spaghetti western genre, that much venerated collection of Italian films paying homage to the American West, is Leone's playground. His name towers over every other contributor to that genre, so much so that you can't even discuss it without mentioning this film, \\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,\\" \\"A Fistful of Dollars,\\" and nearly every other spag Leone made with Clint Eastwood. Sergio Leone didn't even invent this particular genre--that honor goes to Sergio Corbucci with his groundbreaking \\"Django\\"--but Leone gave it a scope few others did. Even more surprising is the discovery that none other than Dario Argento helped draft the screenplay for this film (with Bernardo Bertolucci). If you're not a scary movie buff, Argento went on to define the Italian horror genre with classic shockers like \\"Deep Red,\\" \\"Tenebre,\\" \\"The Bird with the Crystal Plumage\\" and a number of other deeply disturbing films. Throw in composer Ennio Morricone and this movie serves as a critical nexus of Italian filmmaking.<br /><br />Goodness, how to write a summary of this film and do it the proper justice? Leone introduces us to the principals right from the start, beginning with the arrival of a sinister, harmonica playing figure (Charles Bronson) at a train station. Three men wait for him, two of whom are played by veteran character actors Jack Elam and Woody Strode. The scene unfolds with a sureness and deliberate pace that tells you right from the start that this film is something different. Then we meet the McBain family, a hardy bunch of Irish pioneers living out in the middle of nowhere. The patriarch of the clan, Brett (Frank Wolff), and his children are setting up an outdoor feast to welcome Jill (Claudia Cardinale) to her new role as wife and stepmother. Unfortunately, tragedy strikes in the form of a vicious gunslinger known as Frank (Henry Fonda), a man whose unspeakable atrocities committed at the McBain household speak to his immorality and pure meanness. Then Leone shows us Jill heading out to the meet her new family only to run into the outlaw Cheyenne (Jason Robards) and the aforementioned Harmonica at a seedy watering hole. At this point, we're far into the film and have no idea of where Leone is taking us. Don't worry; his hand is steady and his goals pure.<br /><br />It turns out that everyone in this corner of Arizona thought Brett McBain was an utter fool to plunk down so much money to buy up a bunch of property out in the middle of nowhere. But they were wrong. McBain knew exactly what he was doing when he moved his family out into the blasted desert climes. It has something to do with the railroad, and if things go his way he will soon become an extraordinarily wealthy individual, perhaps the richest man in the Arizona territory. These plans come to a screeching halt with his sudden demise, but Jill McBain decides to stay on at the house and make a go of things. She doesn't know about her late husband's plans, not at this point anyway, but Frank and his big shot railroad boss Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti) know exactly what is at stake. Morton unleashed Frank on McBain, and now he plans on doing the same thing with Jill. This straightforward plot becomes complicated with the arrival of the enigmatic Harmonica, who has an ancient score to settle with a certain wicked gunslinger, and also when Cheyenne throws his chips in with Jill. Romance, violence, atmosphere in spades--\\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" simply oozes everything that makes a movie a classic.<br /><br />Where to start? How about Henry Fonda, a beloved actor for decades due to a number of personable roles who strays about as far from his usual niche as possible here. Fonda turns in what constitutes one of thegreat onscreen villain roles as the cold-blooded Frank. Charles Bronson--whose Harmonica character is essentially a good guy--is often just as chilling as Frank in word and deed. Jason Robards strikes a more personable chord as the helpful outlaw Cheyenne, and Claudia Cardinale is strikingly beautiful as a woman with a past who becomes the epitome of the frontier spirit through gritty spirit. These characters move in a beautifully photographed environment that soon becomes a character with as much importance as the human actors. Ennio Morricone's score, especially Jill McBain's theme, is breathtaking and adds considerable depth to the proceedings. It's literally impossible to give this lengthy masterpiece credit in a short review. In fact, multiple viewings are absolutely necessary to appreciate fully the various plotlines and character motivations. I think it's obvious Sergio Leone had a great love for America, or at least the archetypes that made America what it is, and in these times it's refreshing to see a profession of fondness for my country on such a grand scale.<br /><br />Leone also loved American westerns, according to comments made on the commentary track, and he lifted many of his scenes both large and small from other films. That might make the film sound derivative, and in some respects the film historians relating this information on the audio track make it sound that way, but nothing could be further from the truth. This film reinterprets the western in a way that breathes fresh life into the genre. What we see and hear looks and sounds more realistic, more in tune with how the Old West actually functioned, than any film about the time made on these shores. If you haven't spent any time watching spaghetti westerns, you need to put this one at the top of your list.f the great onscreen villain roles as the cold-blooded Frank.

B0006GAI6Y|4.0|I really loved this movie. It seems that the older Richard Gere gets, the better actor he becomes (He was always very good by the way). I found his role very entertaining & at the same time you relate to it. JLO is as beautiful as ever, although I expected more of her. If I start talking about Suzan Sarandon I will never stop. Although her role could have been done by any actress, they will never give the role the grace that she adds to anything she does. <br /> <br />I really loved the movie (I watched twice in 24 hours!!), my favorite bit is the Waltz in the competition. I would definitely recommend it.
B0007GAEW6|3.0|Much of the Mars Volta's new CD sounds as if it was recorded ON Mars.  That's not always a bad thing.  I'm a fan of controlled wildness like John Zorn or Flaming Lips, and some of the adventurous spirit of the music on Frances appeals to me in that same way.  It certainly is a head trip.  However, I like a little melody with my weirdness, and there's not enough of that on this CD.  For all of those who voted \\"5 stars\\" for this, I wonder if they will really be playing the CD on \\"repeat,\\" singing along with the songs, or having the tunes run in their heads.  Not likely, because there aren't that many actual tunes on Frances the Mute.  There are a lot more sound effects, samples, electronic manipulations, etc. than actual melodies.  This music was interesting to listen to, and I'm sure it will be a wild ride in concert.  But as far as actual SONGS, the CD falls short.
B00008WG3U|4.0|I didnt know what to give this CD.  It's a good CD but its definantly not the best NoFx cd.  I like Punk in Drublic and Heavy Petting Zoo the best...but this is a good CD.  Some songs are more poppy, some are faster, some have ska.  It's a mix of a lot of things.  The political message is kind of blah but i respect it.  Songs such as The Idiots are Taking Over and Whoops I O'D are great songs.  If your looking for older NoFx, this is not a good Cd to get...but if u are looking for a more poppy and better sounding CD then this is for u.  It is also a CD you can only listen  to so many times before it gets boring.
B00005JNPZ|4.0|There are a couple reasons I took off one star here: <br /> <br />1.  It is yet again another condemnation of women who are not absolutely drop dead gorgeous.  It features plain, fat, average-looking guys ending up with absolutely gorgeous women.  The double standard here is hard to miss, and disappointing.  The only thing that makes it tolerable is that it is somewhat central to the storyline. <br /> <br />2.  Once we get past the rather clever Cyrano De Bergerac and Pygmalion references, it goes into the realm of Prometheus in its creation of romantic relationships.  One would think that up until that point, Hitch has never had a disappointed client, which implies that men will absolutely love their partner if they get the right coaching.  None of these relationships will fall prey to what ended up happening to Hitch. <br /> <br />That's it.  Those are the only things wrong with the movie.  It is a fun romantic comedy which starts off very cleverly, and then devolves into a standard formula driven romantic comedy.  I enjoyed it, but had problems with numbers 1 and 2 above.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Wow, even though I'm not that old, only fifteen, I've seen a good amount of films and have only recently watched this one. I'm not exactly sure why I've put it off so long, but upon watching it a night ago, I found myself watching, yes I definitely agree with most people, one of, if not, the greatest films ever. The script was witty, smart, intriguing, and emotional, along with Orson Welles' incredible direction and Gregg Toland's flawless and beautifully crafted cinematography, gave us quite possibly the most influential film in history. I've read a number of negative reviews about this film and I am sad to read that AFI put it on their top 100 movies list as #1 because many of the AFI listeners are watching it, and for the most part, are giving it bad reviews, people who can't appreciate the film for what it is, people who are too interested in modern Hollywood. People should stop looking to their favorite bands and celebrities for what they should watch and listen to. I think that it's the fact that it makes people think too much that gets many of them, because most of the negative reviews state that the film is garbage and boring. This is a quote from one of these reviews, \\"Citizen Kane is a hymn to all filmmakers who have ever tried to create something artistic and meaningful and failed miserably every step of the way.\\" first of all, the quote that the reviewer is ripping off is well known, obviously said about Plan 9, and I just can't comprehend how anyone could say that this film failed every step of the way, seeing as how just about every film today is somehow influenced by Kane. I don't mean to sound cynical or mad, I just don't understand it. Anyway, for those who haven't seen it and can appreciate a film for all of its qualities, see this film! <br />
B0007MVXQG|4.0|Halford's official return to Priest is a pretty good listen.  I give it four stars because the album was damned good, but not as deadly as Painkiller and Screaming for Vengeance.<br /><br />So what, though. This is an excellent piece of work.<br /><br />The band took no chances. There are no jugulator type departures, and most of the stuff is downright melodic.<br /><br />Halford sings, screams, and does everything you expect on a Priest album.<br /><br />The guitar work is pretty good, but doesn't blaze any new trails, although it's still light years ahead from the usual metal fare.<br /><br />The DVD is entertaining, with the highlight being the live version of Diamonds and Rust, where Halford sings as never before, exhibiting that he indeed has a great voice on multiple registers.<br /><br />Angel of Retribution, above all things, serves notice that Priest is way back, and will hang around as long as the guys in the band can get enough energy up to go out and do it one more time.<br /><br />Good stuff!!
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This album is a triumph, no doubt about it.  De-loused in the Comatorium was a fantastic debut album that made a lot of people take notice of The Mars Volta, and rightly so.  With Frances the Mute, they have established in my books their undesputable status as the best new band out there right now, hands down.  Not two minutes into the first track I was sold, even having heard the single The Widow on their site already.  Their recent success with De-loused is evident by them taking liberty to write what seems like only half the lyrics in English!  A bold move, but definetely adds to their unique feel.  I can't think of another band that sounds quite like them, but if I had to describe them I would say Pink Floyd crossed with Santana (for the Latin influences).<br />I had heard their first album described as &quot;prog-punk&quot;, if there is such a thing, and it seemed like the best description I had heard.  With Frances the Mute, I would definetely place them squarely in the prog-rock category, with a hint of punk splashed in.  No matter how you classify their music, if you liked De-loused in the Comatorium, or are just a fan of great prog music in general, you will love Frances the Mute.
0689835604|5.0|My daughter is 13 months and just LOVES this book.  It is so adorable and the pages are so bright and cheerful.  She loves playing \\"peek a boo\\" with the characters in the book.  I think this book is worthy of 10 stars!!
0765309408|5.0|Its perhaps strange but a number of the review's of this book compare it to two other successful science fiction books Starship Troopers by Robert Heinlien and the Forever War by Joe Haldeman.     Heinlien was a navy officer who did some equipment design and a lot of Starship Troopers has a feeling of the early Pacific War. A fight against  a relentless and determined enemy who did not play by the rules. Most of the book is in fact about troop training and the sorts of virtues which Heinlien saw as important. Unquestioning obedience, patriotism and a rejection of what might be called liberal squeamishness. This training creates a sort of superior more realistic man who it is argued should be the only ones who have access to the political process.   Halderman wrote a book that on the face of it seemed to be a response to Starship Troopers and won the Hugo award. Its plot is long since common knowledge so there is no real surprise in giving it away. Broadly in Halderman's book a interstellar war which goes on for thousands of years was started by a mistake and there was no real basis for it in the first place. The training which occurs is often grotesque poorly thought out and simply irrelevant to actual military operations.     In the past Heinlen's book has been seen as some sort of right wing manifesto and Halderman's a satirical response. Probably they just reflect the historical periods in which they were written. Heinlen's in a period in which western democratic values were under threat and Halderman's when there were question marks about whether the Vietnamese war was such a good idea.     This book does not really seem to have much of a political agenda after all. One of the minor characters who represents a conservative mid west figure is portrayed in a hostile manner but there appear not big themes.     Rather the book is an adventure and an exploration of what happens if we were to get a second try at youth with the wisdom and experience of old age under our belt. The test of course of a science fiction book is whether it is fun to read. This book is and you can read it in an afternoon. In addition the joy of the book is not simply the revelation of a plot or a certain universe. The author is highly intelligent and his observation of things and characters has a depth which, is unusual in a lot of science fiction and marks the better products of the genre.
B000687M48|4.0|I was so thrilled when I saw evanescence has a concert CD + DVD. I went out and bought it and was a bit disappointed....the DVD is excellent! the \\"behind the scenes\\" is funny and wonderful! the only trouble is the the recording of this concert is lacking. the level of this recording is not what you expect to get from a top band....but in the end it ROCKS. amy lee ROCK! and it's a beautiful cover to \\"thoughtless\\". buy it even just for the DVD.
B0001MDQ2G|5.0|Hailing from Israel, this five-piece doom-metal outfit released their third full-length album, the genre-bending \\"Mabool\\", in April of last year.  For metal enthusiasts, a simple formula would suffice to describe the album's diversity and genius.  Combine Green Carnation's command of ominous riffage, Opeth's death-metal growls and progressive twists, Agalloch's double-kick rhythmic constancy, Therion's operatic choirs, and middle-eastern influences, and you'd have what may resemble Orphaned Land's metal opus.  And yet, this \\"simple\\" recipe doesn't do the album justice.<br /><br />Try to imagine the soundtrack to a desert battle.  Now add a fast drum-track.  Now add distorted guitars.  Add to that over 25 session musicians, including a choir ensemble, violins, cellos, pianos, a saz, a buzuki and an oud (all middle-eastern instruments).  Combine the harsher elements of death- and doom-metal with soft, soothing passages of mystic chanting and orchestral arrangements, and you'd be approaching the album's sound.<br /><br />Although they haven't yet perfected the science, Orphaned Land do a great job with the hard/soft practice of song-crafting.  The album's 7-minute opener, \\"Birth of the Three\\" provides an accurate sample of the metal and middle-eastern elements to come.  It begins with a child chanting and seconds later, continues with a drum break and distorted guitars.  After that, the song is a sonic tapestry of various elements that are rarely found together on one song.  Kobi Farhi balances a delicate croon with raspy screams well, the guitars are reminiscent of Opeth's \\"Orchid\\" album, and the choirs that bring the song to its grand peak perfectly compliment melodic guitars.  The song is fairly long for its constant rhythm and lack of radical change.  Yet, the band keeps the momentum with sturdy riffs and melodies that don't lose their appeal with repeated listens.<br /><br />The band slows down a bit with the second track, \\"Ocean Land\\", my personal favorite track.  The screams are still there, but now layered with acoustic guitars and chants.  The third track, \\"The Kiss of Babylon\\" re-takes the intensity for the first half of the song, and adds a very catchy choir-line for the second half.  \\"A'salk\\" is a short, idyllic instrumental with a woman chanting in Hebrew to light percussion and acoustic guitars.  Predictably, the album kicks back into overdrive with \\"Halo Dies\\", resuming the signature riffs of most doom-metal bands, coupling the ominous dark side of distortion with Farhi's chants.<br /><br />The album maintains this pattern of hard/soft throughout the majority of its duration.  Songs like \\"Norra El Norra\\" begin with a hymn-like tone and quickly incorporate the metal elements that have made this album a rocker so far.  Softer pieces like \\"The Calm Before the Flood\\" and \\"Rainbow\\", both aptly titled, are usually placed before heavier pieces, showing the band's restraint and songwriting discipline.<br /><br />Thematically, the album takes on the Biblical story of the Flood as its main concept.  The album's full title is \\"Mabool: The Story of the Three Sons of Seven\\" and it narrates the tale of three children, each of whom embodies a monotheistic religion (Christianity, Islam and Judaism).  I credit the band for such an ambitious topic, but like any metal album, the lyrics are seldom the primary focus (or strength) of the work.<br /><br />The album isn't perfect.  For all its mesmerizing mysticism, the album has a few passages (acoustic and heavy) are a bit dragged and lack the atmosphere that bands with similar sounds command.  The back-to-back offering of the title-track \\"Mabool\\" and \\"The Storm Still Rages Inside\\", clocks in at over 16 minutes of constant, often-repetitive riffage.  Without a significant break in melody, the end of the album is a little difficult to digest.<br /><br />For its few flaws, the sound is so rich and clean, it's almost pompous.  The various instruments are keenly integrated, but are ubiquitous in the album.  Aided by a stellar production, it is a must-have for any lover of passionate, orchestral music.is a must-have for any lover of passionate, orchestral music.

0446604844|2.0|This book was difficult to get through.  The writing felt very, well, written.  Imagine an FBI agent talking for fifteen minutes while apprehending a bad guy.  Imagine this same agent uttering such phrases as \\"this weapon should evidence your homocidal intent\\" and other such phony and cacaphonic tripe, and you will only begin to understand how silly this book is.    Baldacci comes across like a librarian in an argyle sweater trying to write tough \\"zingers\\" on every page.  He has no idea how real people might talk in dangerous circumstances, so he tries to overcompensate with embarassing results.  I personally blushed or groaned nearly every page at his feminine rage being spewed out in dialogue and descriptions that miss the mark in every conceievable fashion.      Add to this the idiocy of the main character--acting in ways both too stupid and too intelligent to be any real protagonist, and the contrivances of plot needed to milk this meager theme for hundreds of pages, and you see the frustrating experience it is to read the work.    I shall regale you with one more fine example of the action scenes--when Sydney has met with a \\"deadly\\" [Baldacci's thesaurus apparently has only two words: deadly and murderous] intruder in her home, Sydney has a weapon trained on him at near-point blank range when he suddenly catapults into a swan dive behind the couch!  \\"Milliseconds\\" before she can fire, he launches himself behind the couch.      Is this \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon?\\"  No, just Baldacci sipping cups of cocoa on doilies trying to make up action sequences before returning to his needlepoint.
B00000JCB2|1.0|If you read my review for \\"Results May Vary\\", you might have read that this is mediocre. I take that back. This sucks!<br /><br />Fred Durst has no talent whatsoever. Even a 2 year old knows that. These guys make Slipknot look like death metal, for Christ's sakes! Besides, what kind of name is Limp Bizkit? Well, if it describes them, they are limp! The mediocrity from \\"Three Dollar Bill, Yall$\\" was killed off. Face it, this sucks.<br /><br />If you think this sounds like Korn, you are mistaken. Korn had potential. They came up with something unique. They had some flaws in their CD's, but they still had potential. Besides, more people like Korn than Limp Bizkit.<br /><br />If you blast this through your car stereo, people will think you're a loser. I'd rather pop in some new Slipknot. (Their new album is good, despite what I hear from negative reviewers.) Better yet, scare them off with brutal stuff from Lamb Of God or Chimaira, both kick ass bands! Just stay away from Limp Bizkit, the biggest group of posers who want to copy Korn and Insane Clown Posse.
B000002UZ1|5.0|This album is one of my favorite album because it has alot of the beatles best hits! (even though every song they made was a hit!)

B000683VI4|5.0|I've seen many romance movies, but this one held all my attention from beginning to end. Ryan Gosling was mesmerizing as was Rachel McAdams.  It's so sweet it's sad, but what a wonderful film!  The director did a great job of letting the characters get to know one another.  It's the type movie you hate to see end.  Wouldn't we all love to find this kind of love?  Just see it!  It's lovely!

B0007N1AI6|4.0|For all the different styles of metal that I've enjoyed over the past 23 years, Judas Priest will always hold a special place in my heart as the band that got me into metal in the first place back in '82 with 'Screaming For Vengence' and will always be my sentimental favorite band through thick and thin...and for the past 12 years, there's been a lot of \\"thin\\".  So to say that I was looking forward to this CD, which marks the triumphant return of their REAL frontman, is a huge understatement.  Does it deliver? <br /> <br />OK, let me be honest: when viewed objectively, this CD is an almost laughably anachronistic and painfully clich old-school metal album.  The best way I can describe it is that it sounds like a cross between an `80's Priest album and Halford's `Crucible' CD, helped all the more by the fact that Roy Z kept the production slightly raw.  I'm sure that this was all very carefully calculated, as this album completely throws out all the failed nu-metal experiments of the two Ripper Owens fiascos and targets older fans almost exclusively (I honestly can't see a 14 year old Killswitch Engaged fan finding anything of interest here). Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.   <br /> <br />What works are tracks like the mind-blowing opener \\"Judas Rising\\" with it's slowly-faded-in Halford scream and chugging mid-paced riff that feels like a tank rolling over your skull.  What doesn't work are tracks like the single \\"Revolution\\", which opens with a flagrant Sabbath-ripoff bass intro leading into plodding go-nowhere filler. And the cheese factor is in full force here, with the lyrics making endless references to classic Priest songs, as well as the 13-minute-long (yes, you read that right) closing track \\"Loch Ness\\" which could just as easily have been recorded by Spinal Tap and played alongside \\"Stonehenge\\".    <br /> <br />I was surprised by the lack of any real caffeine monsters ala \\"Freewheel Burning\\" and the inclusion of THREE ballads.  Nothing soppy like \\"Before the Dawn\\" or adrenaline-pumping like \\"Touch of Evil\\", mind you; they're all quite good, with \\"Eulogy\\" reminding me of the dirge-y interludes on `Sad Wings of Destiny'.  <br /> <br />Overall, I would say that you will hear what you want to hear on this CD.  If you go into it thinking that Priest are over the hill and can't cut it anymore, you'll still feel that way after listening to this.  If you go into it looking for a return of the Priest of the `80's and realizing that it wasn't always perfect, you'll get what you want.  Admittedly, with the possible exception of \\"Judas Rising\\", there's nothing here that I would consider \\"classic\\" Priest, but there's nothing on here that's an outright turn-off, either, whereas `Turbo', `Ram It Down', `Jugulator', and `Demolition' are LOADED with turn-offs. The bonus DVD (don't get the DualDisc version, pay the extra 5 bucks and get the limited edition CD & DVD set) with 7 live songs and a documentary from the reunion show in Barcelona, Spain makes this an excellent value.  You make the call.  <br /> <br />Good stuff: \\"Judas Rising\\", Rob's vocals still reign supreme, the return of Tipton/Downing solos, the willingness to buck trends and deliver an old-school album. <br /> <br />Bad stuff: No real classic material, excessive cheese, lyrics still lacking sophistication. <br /> <br />
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I can't even explain how incredible this album is.  Cassandra Geminni is the best piece of music that I have ever heard.  The CD reminds me of Pink Floyd's Umma Gumma but with more direction.  The lyrics are again random but completely selective. Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus is awesome.  There are moments on the CD where I think it could potentially end because of such climax, but it continues to my approval. Listen to the CD on surround sound and so many different elements will hit you and of course let's not forget the complete instrumental masterpiece and additions of the trumpet, saxophone, and flute.  This album, I must say, is more instrumentally complex than De-Loused and is more mature.  They have created their own plateau in the world of music where only a few stand.
B0007O38F8|1.0|50 is nothin without production.  His first album had probably the best beats on it that an album has had in the past 5 years.  This one dont and his lyrics and flow are awful.

B000002P2V|4.0|Who Are You (1978.), the Who's eighth studio album<br /><br />'Who Are You' by far gets the most unfair treatment of all of the Who works. Why it does so always perplexes me - I get sick and tired of seeing this album get called 'a failed attempt'. I'll say first though, that this is not at the levels of 'Who's Next' or the Who's live masterpiece, 'Live at Leeds', but it is a solid, sometimes catchy effort which sees the Who at their most personal and expressive. The fact this album is so revealing in its style and lyrics is probably the reason why many people like to bash this album about and give it a hard time. With this album you are getting a much different perspective of the Who. Gone are the days of the Who singing anthems on a 'Teenage Wasteland' theme but now, with 'Who are You' and the previous album, 'The Who By Numbers' we see a pouring of emotion based around the troubles of mid-life. At the centre of this transition is Townshend, who by this stage was getting pissed of with life in general. Going through very much a mid-life crisis, Townshend was determined to keep the Who up to date, against the tide of up an coming punk rockers who were emerging at the time - as a result with this album, the songs he wrote try to consolidate the punk ethos with the Who's normal rock R+B style and I would not say that it is a totally failed attempt at that either.<br /><br />However, Townshend and the Who at the time were not in the greatest shape. Townshend had a drink and drugs problem and this was taking its toll on him and the band. The 'Who Are You' studio album took more than 6 months to record - with Townshend often sporadically turning up to recording sessions. Keith Moon was also not faring in the greatest fashion. His weight had increased dramatically since the last album was released in 1975 and the greatest drummer of all times work in this album are very much more low key and in some parts slightly sloppy - a mile away from the breathtaking stuff we witness in 'Who's Next' and countless other earlier Who albums. Furthermore, this was to be the last album on which Keith Moon played drums, as he died of an overdose on a prescription drug two weeks after 'Who Are You' was released. In many respects, this makes the front cover of the album extremely ironic as Moon, pictured with the rest of the band, is sat on a seat which says on the back of it 'Not to be taken away' - was this some kind of premonition with the album. That aside, you can therefore see the problems which were centred around the making of this album - in fact, it was a blessing that John Entwhistle was the only one who held the whole thing together - he went to every recording session and when the others didn't turn up would just practise his baselines. The often abrupt absense of Townshend also allowed a bit more of a contribution from the Ox, in this album, he contributes 3 songs as opposed to his usual allowance of 1 on previous albums.<br /><br />So who do the songs on this the last album with the full Who line up we all know fare. I personally do not dislike any of the songs on the album, true some are unspectacular but there is nothing that marrs the work's overall standing, even if it isn't a classic. I quite like the very much 'I'm through with life' attitude of the album, this is not to everyones taste I suppose, but then I can be a bit of a pessimist.<br /><br />The whole thing kicks off with 'New Song' a great track with that classic Who beat to it and a catchy riff. 'Had Enough' follows this, a John Entwhistle with very much negative lyrics but it works well with the keyboard backing and heavy baseline. Daltrey's vocals are very good here and actually stand out an awful lot on this album, purely because we see much less singing from Townshend and Entwhistle - he certainly shows why he is one of the great rock voaclists on this album. '905' is an intersting track, again by John Entwhistle with a theme about a test-tube baby. 'Sister Disco', 'Music Must Change' and 'Trick of the Light' are all good tracks, though they will never give you the urge to get up and press the repeat button to replay them. 'Guitar and Pen' is very much a Townshend work, with lyrics relevant to what he was going through in life at time. 'Love is Coming Down' is a very good track, a slower beat which works very well. 'Who Are You' the album title track is though an excellent finish to the album, a song well deserving of a place on any Who 'best of' album - Daltrey's vocals are again particularly powerful on this track as he sings, this time about the aftermath of Townshend's encounter with the Sex Pistols. These were the 9 original album tracks. 'No Road Romance' and 'Empty Glass' are both good extras as do the welcome remixes of the last 3 tracks on the original album.<br /><br />A solid effort overall with some good material which works very well in context of where the Who were going at the time. This album does not deserve a lot of the criticism it gets. 'Who Are You' proved actually to be a good success in the UK, reaching #6 but in the US it did phenominally well, reaching #2 (partly due to a massive sales increase after Moon's death). It would have gone to #1 any other time, but Grease was out at the time and prevented it reaching the top slot.<br /><br />This is no ultra definitive Who album but is certainly a work any person who is really starting to enjoy listening to the Who should invest in as it is another capture of the band's colourful career.the Light' are all good tracks, though they will never give you the urge to get up and press the repeat button to replay them.

B00008RV1L|4.0|Although the movie is overall dark in subject matter, it's a must-see-movie thanks to Christian Bale. The character he plays is hellacious, but Christian is heavenly. Not only does he look so beautiful from head to toe, but his acting skills far surpass most others. And luckily, for people like me who don't like gruesome material, the director cuts away from the violence taking place in the film.
B0007GAEW6|3.0|First song: awesome.  Second song: great.  Third song: very interesting!  But the rest of it, which is most of it time-wise, just isn't very exciting.  Sounds like they're wasting a lot of time and space with lengthy outros and relatively boring riffs. <br /> <br />Where is the incredibly tight groove that we heard in Deloused In The Comatorium? There is a little bit of it in the first track of Frances The Mute, but to me, this album sounds largely improvisatory and thrown-together.
B0007O38F8|1.0|I hate 50 Cent with a passion so deep, that whenever somebody mentions his name, I foam at the mouth and become overwhelmed with rage.  He is the very embodiment of every black male stereotype you can think of: the muscled, dark-skinned, gut-tootin', crack-dealin', oversexed, Popeye's-chicken-eatin' thug.  It is truly disgusting.  I cannot even stand the sight of him.  Nothing else in the world would make me happier than to see this album flop.  It will probably go multiplatinum, but I will still pray that this record will TANK on the charts and that 50 Cent never ever records again.
B00005JMXX|4.0|\\"Can it really happen?\\" <br />\\"What should we do to prevent this?\\" <br />\\"Oh my god...I'm scared!\\" <br /> <br />It was comments like these that filled the movie theatre directly after the movie. Well, all I can say is that \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" certainly had me wondering...\\"Is this really going to happen?\\" <br /> <br />Better-than-decent-yet-still-not-perfect acting and a solid orchestral score gave this movie a sort-of atmospheric feeling. When you get into the theatre (or watch the movie on a giant flat-screen TV, etc.) and you first hear the thunder on the FOX entertainment logo (it has to be through surround sound to give you that real excited feeling), you will almost surely know that this movie will not disappoint. I liked how the special effects looked almost real...that is, almost. <br /> <br />Dennis Quaid did a fine job acting, and the guy who played his son was a great actor as well. I'm definitely going to be buying this on DVD.

B0007NFL18|3.0|It's not a bad album compared to some of the trash that is out there now.  What people have to realize is that 50 is a business man so he is gonna make music that sells and also create enough buzz where even if the music isnt that great people will buy the album.  In regards to his beef with almost everybody in the rap game, who really cares.  Like I said, that is all part of his marketting campaign.  But no one can deny that 50's music is catchy and rocks in a car so for that its worth a listen.  Its a shame that we have to rationalize rap music like this nowadays. <br /> <br />-Mooch

I don't know why anyone wouldn't like the movie because it has everything anyone would want, special effects, action, and i like Roland Emmerich's films, really think he has a good imagination and a good storyteller in all of his movies such as Independance day and the day after tomorrow! Oh and by the way the rain does not make it harder to see godzilla at all! I highly recommend this great popcorn flick to anyone who likes action and suspensful movies!!!
0783235380|1.0|Okay, the script is not the most imaginative I've ever seen, but I like the actors (especially Ben's best man) so I was friendly with this movie for the most part.  I didn't even mind the obvious holes in the plot, such as...why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones? Or at least, why don't they use them?  Oh no, much more plausible that Ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for $150 to buy a car to drive to NC.  I didn't even mind the fact that the whole \\"We're married and my husband's a doctor.\\" charade was so predictable. Oh Gee, he's pretending to be a doctor and he's on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people. D'ya think someone might have a heart attack and \\"Dr. Holmes\\" might have to step up?  And uh, they're pretending to be married and Oh! surprise there's the best man and maid of honor! D'ya think they're gonna get busted?<br /><br />What killed it for me was that ridiculous ending.  It was obviously supposed to be a surprise (and it was) but there seemed to be no other reason for it than to pull a fast one on the audience.  I felt cheated. I spent the entire movie getting emotionally involved with the relationship between Sarah and Ben, and I really cared about how they would handle things with the fiance and Sarah's little boy and all that.  I cheerfully became disengaged from the relationship between Ben and Bridget, I totally believed neither one of them was ready to get married or right for each other.  The film spent an inordinate amount of time showing me they're not right for each other and that this wedding was not meant to happen.  RIGHT UP TO THE LAST MOMENT, we think he's breaking it off with Bridget. Instead, what the heck let's just go ahead and get married after all.<br /><br />Huh?  He left Sarah sitting out there waiting for him in a HURRICANE!!! after making her promise that she would still be there when he got back.  This man obviously doesn't have a clue what he wants in life, and I'm expected to believe they lived happily ever after?<br /><br />Not only that, but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously?  It teaches us that if our instinct is telling us \\"don't do it!\\" and our genitals are yearning for someone else and even Mother Nature seems to be working hard to prevent this marriage, aw heck go on ahead and do it anyway.  It's just marriage. It's romantic! You could get lucky and live happily ever after!<br /><br />It's been my experience, when things aren't feeling just right as you approach that wedding, turn and run. The last thing you should do is close your eyes, grab your balls and take the leap.lived happily ever after? <br /> <br />Not only that, but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously?

B0002X314C|5.0|This WHOLE CD is off the hook! :) I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed every single song. My favorite is Get Lifted. All the songs are very well performed. Buy this CD, now!
B0007O38F8|1.0|This album is sooo terrible, it sounds like a remix of his first cd, with some shots at nas, jadakiss, and fatjoe, among others, this cd blows, ive heard about you gettting shot a hundred times fifty, i dont care if you got a bunch of money and cars, so do another hundred million rappers, go back into the studio and get some lyrical content, or go get shot again and die, the only good thing i could see on this record were his beats, some of the beats were pretty good, but oh wait 50 doesnt make those, so 50 you pretty much suck.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|Nothing against Ripper whom I saw live in '98, and who did an excellent job in Rob's absence, but the true Priest is back! Not only musically, but more importantly from a Lyrical sense. The lyrics on \\"Jugulator,\\" and \\"Demolition\\" were sophomoric at best, and let's just say those days are over!!  <br /> <br />Saw the reunited Priest at Ozzfest, and hope to see them again soon!! Call to the Priest!!!
B0007TKH66|5.0|Star Trek Enterprise:  The Best Star Trek ever!  Coming from someone who has enjoyed every Star Trek series to date (some more than others) I think it is the very Best. Probably even better than TNG. It is the first series in a long time that I simply can not & will not miss.(though since it's moved to Friday nights I have to record it & watch it latter)  Great Story telling, Great Acting, Great Cast and a Great Charisma among them make this series.....  GREAT! Even my wife who is not a scifi fan at all or even a Star Trek fan(outside the original series) enjoys this show. Admittedly she only decided to catch a few episodes early on because she is a Scott Bakula fan, but now she is also hooked. We absolutely Love the theme song, But even though there were only subtle changes made to it, the original version was much better. Anyway, I discovered the site while trying to pre-order a season 1 & 2 DVD set and thought I would throw my 2 cents in.     Thanks, RC
B0007N1AI6|5.0|IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING, I WAS GETTING TIRED OF LISTENING TO ALL THE OLD PRIEST ALBUMS. THE MAN IS BACK WHERE HE SHOULD BE, AND SOUNDS JUST AS GOOOD AS THE DAY HE LEFT. THE METAL ALBUM OF 2005, AND HOPEFULLY THOSE OTHER METAL BANDS OUT THERE TAKE NOTE. BEST SONGS ARE JUDAS RISING AND DEAL WITH THE DEVIL, BUT ALL ARE GREAT. WITH A VOICE LIKE ROB'S IT'S GREAT TO HAVE HIM BACK WITH THAT DUEL AXE ATTACK OF K.K. AND GLENN. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE U.S. TOUR. KEEP THE METAL ALIVE!!!
B0007O38F8|5.0|I have heard the entire cd and every song is fire, so if you like bangin ryder music you'll love this cd and R.U.L.E sucks a**!!!the best tracks are: Outta Control, Piggy Bank, Gatman and Robin, Baltimore Love Thing, I'm Suppose to die tonight,Get in my car, Ryder Music, Just A Lil Bit, Toy Soldier, and when the gunz come out. I definetly recomend this cd to any real fan of rap and hip hop.
B0007MVXQG|1.0|Absolutely DO NOT buy the crappy dual disc version of this CD.  It probably won't play in your CD Player. <br /> <br />Just because companies come out with new technology does not mean that the new technology works right. <br /> <br />Why pay $14 or $15 bucks for a CD that won't even play in your CD Player at all?! <br /> <br /> <br />CD quality wise =  Waste of money.  It won't play in your CD Player. <br /> <br /> <br />Music wise =  Not bad, but no \\"Painkiller\\" CD.  More like a 2000's version of the \\"Sad Wings of Destiny\\" CD.  It is not an essential PRIEST CD.  Get the \\"Painkiller\\" CD instead.  Either that or the \\"Jugallor\\" and \\"Unleashed from the East\\" CDs.   <br /> <br />On the new CD here; only 6 songs are great.  4 songs are to skip over. <br /> <br /> <br />If you are going to get this CD, get the REGULAR version that costs a little bit more, but it is worth it, for the CD to play in your CD Player. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line is:  If it says Dual Disc on a new CD from any band.  Don't buy it at all!!  It won't play in your CD Player. <br /> <br />
B00005JMXX|5.0|We have all heard the warnings to stop destroying our planet and this movie makes us look at just what might happen if we don't listen.  I sat glued to the TV as this movie played before me watching the total destruction of the tornadoes, hurricanes and blizzards that devoured a good part of the northern world. Seeing New York City destroyed was blood chilling and the human element that was weaved into the storyline brought it right on home.<br /><br />This was a great movie, the special effects were outstanding.  I never saw a building freeze and crumble before. Wow!What a twist on total devastation.  I recommend this movie to everyone, it certainly is well worth your time, and perhaps will make us all think a little bit harder about the future of our planet, and what we can do to make it a brighter one.
B0007O38F8|1.0|...this man has made 50 million dollars (a lot of 50cent pieces) by promoting misogyny, murder, drugs, violence and a genuine anger for all things pure and good...and yet we pour money into him, his clothes, his style, why?  do you want your children to grow in a world where the #1 seller is supporting everything evil with no remorse?  what does this do to our future?  so the \\"beats are great,\\" and what of it?  they'll be forgotten and overplayed in a matter of time and we're left with an emptiness that we think can be filled by more and more shallow rap like 50's...there used to be a meaning and essence in rap/hiphop...for some quality go to men like Kweli and Mos Def...not this joke.

0316172324|4.0|This book is extremely easy and interesting to read. I wouldn't consider it a serious scientific endeavor in how the mind works, but for a general overview and introduction to decision making, it's fascinating.<br /><br />Gladwell spends the first part of the book crediting the amazing power of the brain to \\"thin slice,\\" or make seemingly instantaneous subconscious decisions.  Midway through I was ready to always trust my first instincts and gut decisions. However, the latter part of the book explores how our brains gets \\"thin slicing\\" wrong.<br /><br />The book is thought provoking in that it allows the reader a glimpse into faulty assumptions and biases that strongly influence thoughts and decisions.  Particularly of interest is the discussion on marketing and the IAT (Implicit Association Test)research done by Harvard.<br /><br />Blink is a fun read, but I'm glad that I borrowed it from the library and didn't buy it.
B0007NFL18|3.0|Although I really like 50 Cent, Eminem, and those other rappers, there were many things in this album, \\"The Massacre,\\" that I didn't like.  One was the fact that he basically says the same thing in every song.  \\"I'm rich, I can get any girl I want, and i'm gonna kill you.\\"  Another thing I didn't like was what Eminem said in verse 2 of the song \\"Gatman and Robbin:\\" <br /> <br />    \\"Retaliation will be like them Muslim Shiite ATTACKS\\" <br /> <br />    Though I am not Shiite, I am Muslim, and this line really offended me and many other Muslims I know. <br />    Another thing I didn't like was how 50 Cent made fun of other rappers such as Fat Joe.  This is the problem with rap these days.  People say they don't like rap because the lyrics are profane and violent.  The origin of these violent lyrics is most likely when one rapper disses another.  50 Cent is starting to get out of control.  He, like many other rappers, has a bad habit of dissing others for no reason.  These disses are the cause of all his \\"beefs.\\"  Off topic, there is something I don't like about 50 himself.  First of all, he starts all these meaningless \\"beefs.\\"  Second, he expects all his friends to go along with them.  \\"The Game's\\" being kicked out of G-Unit for not going along with 50's \\"beef\\" is a perfect example of this.  When \\"The Game\\" joined G-Unit, all the 50 Cent and Eminem fans also became \\"The Game\\" fans.  Does 50 Cent expect all us fans to start hating \\"The Game\\" now? <br />    I hope 50 Cent somehow gets to read this review.  Maybe it would make him think hard about some of the things he has said and done.  Maybe it would help him when he's making his next album.
0156012197|3.0|I bought this book a few years ago and loved it. St. Ex was no doubt an interesting man. I adored his little rose and couldn't wait to read The Tale of the Rose. I just read it and I have deeper insight into this story that I'd have rather not seen. St. Ex was a philanderer. In the Little Prince, he refers to The Rose being sad because she is aware that he has been seeing other roses-- he did that throughout their marriage-- for almost the entire 13 years they were married. He was into conquoring The Rose as a Little Prince and basically forgetting about her except to get with her briefly-- less than 24 hours in some cases-- and then leave again. The Little Prince almost seems like a glaze-over and justification for St.Ex's ways. I gave it three stars because it's a sweet story. It's not somehow autobiographical as I had initially thought.
0385510454|3.0|When I picked up \\"The Broker\\" and read the synopsis, I was intrigued by the stretch in versatility on Grisham's part, which is hard to say for most authors who've published 18 novels. He's mixing something familiar (legal/political suspense and drama) with something new and unfamiliar in his novels (all-things Italy). As a huge fan of spy and espionage novels, throwing that scenario in didn't hurt to hook me on the purchase of \\"The Broker\\" either. <br /> <br />Halfway through this book, as Grisham continued on with descriptions of Bologna and more Italian language lessons (when I was beginning to get bored), I decided this story seemed to be written as a foundation for something bigger, say, a movie perhaps!? If that's the case, I would have to agree that the story would (surprise, surprise) make a great movie (as long as those making the film had more experience in the spy bit than Grisham). To \\"see\\" and \\"experience\\" life in any place unfamiliar, and spend that much time on the details of that place, the author has to tap into their ability to transport you there (like he did in \\"The Testament\\"); I didn't quite make it to Bologna. However, to have the story played out on film would be extraordinary!  <br /> <br />The combination in elements of law, politics, espionage, multiple assassinations, Presidential pardons, making a new life in a foreign country, hiding, running, redemption... it's all a fabulous idea. The basic story plot on the surface is exceptional, but to read it was another story. Grisham could have made a hit out of this one, but got lost in the details of Italy. Hopefully someone will take advanatage of this diamond in the rough and put it on the big screen in a bigger way than the novel played out. <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|It is 1 month I play only this CD in my car. It's really awesome.
B0002X314C|4.0|This CD was not what I expected.  The 2 singles released are alot deeper than alot of the other material.  I heard alot of \\"take you from yo' man\\", \\"get high\\" and \\"yo' man don't want it wit' me\\" stuff...  Is this Neo Soul or wanna-be gangsta? Maybe its a reflection of where he is from, but I don't want to hear about you being tough...  if I wanted to hear that then I would listen to 50 or DIPSET, straight up. This is a good effort, but there are some tracks that can definitely be skipped over. I don't know if anyone else agrees, but for me, personally, Dwele and Javier have more playback value for me.      Everyone has their own opinion and I have mine...  I know music and this is not a bad effort, but I don't like some of the subject matter.  I know some people want to support hometown people, etc. But I guess I am set in the ways of \\"old Music\\" EWF, Teena Marie, Bloodstone, Donny Hathaway... stuff like that can never be recreated.  I guess I am \\"out of my mind\\" for my opinion... But there isn't one thing you can do about it, right?!
0609610570|5.0|A great book.  A must read for every leader and manager desiring to execute better.
B00005JLR8|4.0|A pitch perfect tale of overcoming loss and beginning afresh told with masterly skill by Jim Sheridan. Edges close but never tips into sentimentality and is marvellously upbeat despite some truly difficult circumstances the family encounters. With  considerable generosity of spirit this is a film to lose yourself in and relish. Amazingly realistic and honest.  Brilliant.
B00029LNHS|5.0|HEY MAMA@!  <br />i love the song  <br />ITS LIKE OUTKAST- USHER- AARON CARTER -PINK-ASHLEE SIMPSON
B0007N1AI6|5.0|Ok for one thing I just wanna say that yeah this album could have been alittle better but for a comeback album I think it rules. I just think this album is a warm up album. The thing is if people thought that the songs were gonna be all diffrerent and and special well mabey you should read some interviews with the band. Glenn and halford even said that this album is not gonna be anything special but just a typical classic priest album and what they meant by classic priest was not trying to sound like another album but classic priest meaning the way they have been writing and making metal for 30 years. I have to say that every song on this album is great although bring names of old albums and songs in to the new stuff wasn't really cool. And when people try to compare the real priest to the ripper priet there is no comparision. ripper did a good job but people that think ripper should have been the permenant singer for priest HA! people should have known that that would never happen . this reunion was not avoidable which is great. You can't deny rob halford. Granted he is 53 now ofcourse his voice ain't gonna be like it was on screaming for vengence and if you think that well your pretty ignorant. Overall I think this album is a classic. And lets not for get people judas priest does not comprimise they do what they want to do and they know that some people are gonna bitch but you know what they think its great people bitch. <br />
0060931736|4.0|This is an excellent short book about a domineering spinster teacher, named Jean Brodie, who in the 1930's in Edinburgh, Scotland, gathered six girls into the Brodie Set, looking to make them the creme de le creme.  <br /> <br />The best part of this story though is the style Muriel Spark writes with. Juxtaposing time in between paragraphs, letting  information and nuance about Jean Brodie, her girls, her loves, opinions, style and difficulties, trickle out lightly before revealing the truth of the matter, Spark is in full control.  <br /> <br />There is a psychology to her creation of the Brodie Set, the girl with Insight, the girl with Instinct, the Dumb girl, the girl known for her Anger, the Actress, the Athletic girl, all lead by Miss Jean Brodie, who never fails to remind them all, and herself, that she is \\"in her prime.\\" And by this, her ideas, passions and dreams are revealed, to and onto the girls, to tragic, shameful and interesting conclusions.  <br /> <br />This is a classic book, for many reasons. The style of story telling, a wonderfully rounded lead character, whose strength and focus inspire and shape young minds, and a reflective quality that looks on with wonder at the past, and the actions of those who lived through it.
B000001FOL|5.0|I have read a few reviews saying this album is not for everybody.  Who is this album not for? Deaf people? This is a beautiful album and though it is not for every mood if anybody doesn't have a part in their soul that can appreciate this I would question how alive they are.
0679879269|4.0|This book certainly made an impression on me. I found the whole series riddled with the same flaws, but this one, like the first one, surpassed them. It certainly doesn't have the focus, or the sense of wonder and discovery that the first book has, but after reading the second book I had gotten used to the fact that \\"The Golden Compass\\"'s virtues as a story were unique to its own volume, and I was able to enjoy the poorly-woven-together sub-plots for their own sake. <br /> <br />No, it doesn't hold together the series. And it is sylistically confused and inconsistent. Pullman seems to be experimenting with different tones, different ways of describing things as the book goes on. And the good characters (including the universe itself?) are naive, snobby and intolerant in their open-minded way, while the bad ones are jokes/straw men set up to be knocked down. <br /> <br />Yet... and yet... I still enjoyed reading it. Pullman put a lot of energy into creating this book. He didn't manage to construct anything outstanding out of all these symbols, ideas and dramas, but they are worth experiencing on their own. <br /> <br />To be brief, what I like best about Pullman's books is his ability to bring out the power of the individual contents of his book. I agree with anyone who says the ending doesn't wrap up the plot in anyway, or deliver what seems to be promised, but it seemed satisfying in its own way. <br /> <br />*(Spoilers from now on)* <br /> <br />It was satisfying because it was brief and powerful love. It was fulfilling the prophecy, yes, but it doesn't matter (or make much sense in terms of what it's accomplishing). Love is something universal, and Pullman portrayed it very powerfully, and that's why it was satisfying. It's satisfying in itself. I think this is why people like the daemons so much, too: they have an intrinsic appeal regardless of how they're involved with the plot. You can say that about a lot of things in the series. <br /> <br /> <br />The booksare enjoyable if you think of them more as dream-like than as clock-work. Things in dreams have a value on their own. This book was moving towards love, and ultimately parting and growth, the whole time, seemingly in spite of any complicated story-devices and conflicts. In many ways, I find it very satisfying that the plot was sort of thrown away, as if the characters stopped caring. Dust? Authority? Oh, yeah, whatever. They died somehow. The story seems to know what's more important. <br /> <br />Though it lacks the integrity to make it truly great,  <br />reading the book is a worthwhile experience. <br /> <br />P.S. (The ultimate spoiler) A lot of reviewers seem puzzled by the fulfilment of the prophecies. When Lyra leaves Pantalaimon on the shore, she's not fulfilling the betrayal part of the prophecy, but the \\"she will experience pain\\" part of it. She betrayed Roger, and she's going to the land of the dead because of that betrayal. <br />And the Lyra=Eve prophecy: in addition to the fact that Mary tempts Lyra with the story of romance, which gives Lyra an idea of what she wants to do with Will the next day, we also read that Mary gives her a friggin' piece of FRUIT, which she HANDS to Will to EAT right before the critical moment. Come on, people. <br />
B0007MVXQG|5.0|I love this CD, but would recommend the Double Disc, not this Dual disc. Why? Unnecessary wear and tear on the side you're not using, plus no picture on top of the CD (Oh, and absolutely NO pictures of the band anywhere in this package, which was a bit disappointing.) I love the music, but in this day and age of CDs having 15 to 20 songs, this CD seems a bit short - only ten quick songs. This CD draws on all their past music. My first Priest CD was Screaming. I love this CD. My friends first Priest CD was Ram It Down. He loves this CD. As long as you don't expect any surprises on this one, you will be happy and playing this one over and over.
044024157X|5.0|The Last Juror is a very intriguing story and I was pleased to learn more about the southern town of Clanton, Mississippi where Grisham's first novel, A Time to Kill, was also set.  Being a life-long journalist, former newspaper owner, and current author, I particularly related to the newspaper angle in this book.  Grisham is the master of the courtroom, so I'm glad he's back haunting the \\"halls of justice.\\" It's a page-turner, as I find all of Grisham's work.  His superb style and suspenseful \\"twists and turns\\" held my interest from beginning to end.  Betty Dravis is the author of the young adult novel, THE TOONIES INVADE SILICON VALLEY, just released in April, 2005, and of MILLENNIUM BABE: THE PROPHECY.
B000002LEM|3.0|This is Van Hagar's second album coming justafter 5150 was<br />released. This is a very solid second albums with some good<br />songs and stuff that I think just depends on the person.<br /><br />Mine all Mine is a great song. Probably the best on the<br />entire album. Personally, When It's Love is one of my<br />favorite songs. I know it sounds cheesy to some people,<br />but I think it's one song where Sammy shows so much<br />passion. The next song AFU just seems like filler to<br />me and it's one of least favorite on the album. A going<br />through the motions type of feel.<br /><br />We then get down to Cabo Wabo. I don't know, it seems<br />alot like AFU and I just don't feel any entergy or any<br />thing. Almost a careless type feeling. C'mon this is a<br />freakin rock band! Source of Infection is pretty much<br />one of the worst songs the band has done. This is where<br />the album starts to get good! While Feel So Good might<br />sound dated nowdays, it was a very good song for it's<br />time, and even though it isn't hard it provides more<br />entergy than than a couple of the previous songs and<br />it's feel good aswell.<br /><br />We then get down to Finished What You Started. I think<br />I've heard this alittle too much, but it's still a good<br />and fun song anyway. It's a runner up as the best song<br />on the album for sure. Just a cocky fun song. Even the<br />guitar on here has a cocky type of sound. Then we get<br />Black and Blue which is probably ED's best playing on<br />the album with the exception of Finish What You Started.<br />It's actually one of the few rockers on this entire<br />album. Sucker In A 3Piece is a song that might come off<br />as filler to some people, but I feel it's a really<br />under rated Van Halen rocker. We then get down to Apolical<br />Blues which sounds like another filler.<br /><br />I flirted between giving this album 3 or 4 stars. It's a<br />good album with(IMO) 6 good songs and 4 fillers. It really<br />falls about one song short of being worth 4 stars.

0061015725|3.0|Crichton didn't go far enough in his vision of what nanotechnology is really capable of. Granted, in the book, nanotechnology is brand new and so we don't get to see it in all its glory, but we are led to believe that it is good only for turning once-well adjusted people into evil superhuman zombies. I don't have a problem with technology being corrupt, but the direction Crichton takes us in, I thought, is a tad juvenile and could easily have been concocted by an eleven-year-old.  <br /> <br />Despite this drawback, the book was phenomenal for the first third. I found the stay-at-home-dad protagonist to be Crichton's most sympathetic, fully-fleshed, totally relatable character, and it was moving how emotionally confused he is at the prospects of his fantasy marriage falling apart. He's depressed. He's tired. He's flawed. He's human.  <br /> <br />Then, as soon as he visits the Xymos research compound, he morphs into a typical Crichton square-jawed-walking-encyclopedia-MacGyver who is familiar with every single study conducted in the field of science and every paper written in any academic science journal since the dawn of mankind. And of course he can recall every last obscure detail from any of these studies and papers in a matter of nanoseconds. And all this from a guy who's been out of work for half a year. For once I'd like to see a Crichton protagonist declare, \\"I have no freakin' idea what's going on here!\\" <br /> <br />The storytelling is a little sloppy. He throws us all these mysterious, gripping clues and hints and then leaves you wondering about them until the last handful of pages. Basically it's: \\"You remember all those mysterious and gripping clues earlier in the book? Well, here are their explanations. Number one . . .\\" I enjoy the mystery, but not how the mystery is revealed.   <br /> <br />I'm probably being too harsh. Did I enjoy the book while I was reading it? A resounding yes. A critic wrote that Prey is Crichton's most \\"cinema-ready\\" novel. While I disagree, it's certainly one of his strongest.  <br /> <br />For a much more arresting view of what nanotechnology is capable of, read Ray Kurzweil's The Age of Spiritual Machines.     <br /> <br />
B000002LPD|4.0|Coming off of a solid second album Van Hagar decides to <br />come out with a album that seems alittle more clever <br />and a album that contains more rockers. The results are <br />very good. This album brings alot of entergy and fire <br />with it. Something that was alittle bit lacking in OU812. <br /> <br />It starts off with one if not the best Sammy Hagar song <br />ever. Poundcake is a flat out awesome rocker with alittle <br />creativity at the intro. It showcases a side of the band <br />that really hadn't been seen in a while and sets the <br />tempo for a hard album. Great choice for an opener.  <br /> <br />10/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />We get to the second track in Judgement Day which is <br />another really good rocker with some really good work <br />from ED here. He hasn't sounded this inspired in a <br />real good while. <br /> <br />9/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Spanked is pretty much a filler song that could have <br />been left off. <br /> <br />4/10 <br /> <br /> <br />We then have Runaround which actually took awhile to <br />grow on me. It's actually one of Sammy's best shinning <br />songs with the band and just kind of hooks you. <br /> <br />9/10 <br /> <br /> <br />Pleasure Dome is a pretty good song. It doesn't rank <br />as a classic, but it is worthy of being here and it <br />gets a few spins here and there from me. <br /> <br />8/10 <br /> <br />Here the album sinks just a bit.. In 'n Out is pretty <br />just filler. <br /> <br />5/10 <br /> <br />Man on a Mission is the other song along with Spanked <br />that could have been left off this album. It's just <br />a weak song that has no business being here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Dream is Over- What can you say, the guitar just rocks <br />this is one of Ed's most shinning songs on the album. <br /> <br />8/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Right Now is probably the co headline song along with <br />Poundcake. It delivers in the way that When It's Love <br />from OU812 did... But it's a better song. Yes, it's <br />overplayed... but it's one of the best Van Halen tunes <br />and is one of the best pop rock songs ever IMO. <br /> <br />10/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />316 is a solid solo, but it's nothing groundbreaking. <br /> <br />6/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Top of The World is a underrated song off the album. It <br />reminds me alot of Dance The Night Away from the David <br />Lee Roth era. Just a awesome tune with the vocals really <br />standing out. <br /> <br />8/10 <br /> <br />This is a great album for a band that you can argue is <br />at it's peak in terms of the Van Hagar years. Sometimes <br />I actually forget how underrated this album yes until <br />I hear it all over again. Just AMAZING.
B0007O38F8|2.0|From a commercial \\"pop\\" rap album this is good.  But that is it.  The lyrics are a far cry from his first album and even the hooks are horrible.  Candy Shop has to be one of the worst singles of the year. 50's said if he sold one album less than he did on his first album it was a failure. Well this looks to be a failure. The b.s. beef with Nas is incredibly stupid on 50s part.  Nas is a legend. Nas makes rap, hip hop music; not commercial pop records. 50 can sell his millions to the youth of the nation who have no idea what rap is and only listen to it to look cool. If you wanna hear real hip hop pick up anything Nas or either of Talib Kweli's records.  Even better Snoop Doggs Death Row greatest hits. 50 doenst deserve my $15.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I picked up this cd the day it came out.All i can say is every listen since,i love it more and more.This is what real music should be.Not some cracker jack,run of the mill,m-tv crap.These are guy's that take the music and make it part of themselves.See them live if you can,and there is no way you will not be a fan for life.Get this cd and get anything they put to cd.MARS VOLTA ARE THE NEW ZEPPLIN.
B0007O38F8|5.0|Hey Y'all I really don't understand how u all can criticize him for givin' out a bad album, they guy's only in he's third year or somethin' as a pro Rapper and he sold more then anyone else in the game during the period. <br />This critics are really annoying to read because he's really great,  he bring the flow into the rap and the beats, it's a great album! <br />
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD reminds me of my band a few years ago. Amy Lee Sound very close to my voice. Kinda scary to hear and see who was singing. Any way.. it is good to see someone making it through the music business, and winning an award for it :)

B0002OERI0|4.0|Must admit I have never been a big Green Day fan.  They have had a few songs over the years that I've liked but nothing that ever really got me excited.  After hearing Blvd of Broken Dreams several times on the radio I took a chance on this CD and boy am I glad I did!  This is a masterpiece.  Jesus of Suburbia is a modern classic.  Holiday, Letterbomb, Wake Me When September Ends are also great.  Wasn't that crazy about American Idiot (the song) when I first heard it because it sounded like too many other songs they had already done, but even that has grown on me. This is a modern rock CD but there are plenty of influences from classic rock so if you like rock music at all, go out and get this.
B0007O38F8|4.0|Ok...I will admit straight up that I havent gotten a chance to listen to the entire album...I have listened to a few songs though. Im not here to write a review, although I will say that Disco Inferno is a great song and Candy Shop, although it sounds alot like Magic Stick, is a fun song and good single to release to promote the album. Dont think that these are the only two good songs on the cd though, you would have to be crazy. Some of the best producers around and having to live up to his own hype, he isnt just going to put out junk. Im not saying this cd lived up to the hype, but then again, I dont think it could have no matter how good the cd was, because the hype was unbelievable. I just think that many people on here have something against 50, or Eminem, or G-Unit, or something that is just making them write bad reviews without even giving the album a chance. You all just need to chill and enjoy the music...If you dont like 50, then dont listen to it, but dont come on here and bash the cd when you dont know anything about it. 50 is about money and publicity, but this cd is a good one and will have many singles off it in which many people will enjoy....Get used to it...
B00005V3Z4|1.0|I fell asleep half-way through this movie, which I found just about as interesting as watching paint dry. Music in the movie was pretty good though. A lot of people seem to be raving about the movie here so maybe I'm wrong. Just wasn't for me I guess.
0671027387|4.0|This review is for the first Pocket Books Paperback edition published in December 2002, 558 pages of story.  DECEPTION POINT is Dan Brown's third novel.  Although originally published in 2001, DECEPTION POINT did not enter the USA Today bestseller list until May 22, 2003, piggybacking on the popularity of THE DAVINCI CODE.<br /><br />DECEPTION POINT is a fast-paced, suspenseful techno-thriller loaded with did-you-really-want-to-know facts about the artic, meteorites, deep ocean phenomena and cutting-edge military hardware.  Research is Dan Brown's forte; his author's note states: \\"All technologies described in this novel exist.\\"<br /><br />As in the two other Brown novels that I have read, THE DAVINCI CODE and ANGELS & DEMONS, the author tries to pack the drama into an incredible, whirlwind, sleepless 24-hours, although in this one he needed a little more time to get from Washington D.C. to the top of the world and return, with a detour into the Atlantic ocean.<br /><br />If you enjoy thrillers, DECEPTION POINT is a good one if you face a long flight or otherwise risk hours of boredom and want a mindless read.  But for me, even after considering the genre, it was too far out with incredulities, conspiracies and coincidences.

B0000025D0|5.0|This is one of the most powerful albums I have ever heard.  I didn't get Bruce in younger days.  Back in the 80's I was only interested in heavy metal and it wasn't until my early twentys when I began to expand my musical horizons that I understood the Boss.  These songs take on a whole nother meaning now.  A couple of years ago I remember making my hour long trip to work where I supervised a department that due to layoffs was overworked and I was catching heat for the work not getting done from corporate and worried about getting laid off myself. (It was a lot like the movie Office Space) I felt like I was fighting a losing battle and Badlands and Promised Land literally gave me the strength to go into the building.  Sounds corny but listening to this CD was like a religous experience. Even though there is uncertainty and darkness in these songs there is still a sense of hope. Thanks for the inspiration Bruce.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|The album was in stores for a day, and give or take the plenty who downloaded the album in advance, no one has had sufficient time to listen to this cd. While the album itself is huge change from \\"Deloused in the Comatarium,\\" it is definitely and sufficiently for the better. <br /> <br />While Deloused was by far the best album of its year, and will always remain in my top 10, the musical, lyrical and instrumental endeavors on Frances the Mute simply blow it away. Deloused was a very progressive album, unlike anything in years, but despite its progressiveness, it is an album that can still be enjoyed by many who care very little of the intricacys that encompass it. Despite all the amazingly hard word and effort put into literally every SECOND of that album, it can still very easily be passively enjoyed as background music to a car ride, work day, party, etc.  <br /> <br />With Frances, that is not possible. <br /> <br />This album comes at you full force, bringing in the well recognized and distinct sound from the beginning. The tracks are broken into many different stages. Some of these parts are nonstop musical and lyrical barrages, offering the old style with so much more behind it. However, some are just music and noise, which annoy and turn people away. Funny how Omar inserts noise because he feels silence distracts, but the same occurs when he tries to remove it. <br /> <br />Anyways, the problem with this album is that it is MUCH more well written. The songs truly are as much of a project to enjoy for the listener as they were for Omar and Cedric to arrange. Plus, between the radio \\"The Widow\\" and spanish \\"L'Via\\" people already feel betrayed. But I assure you that anybody, ANYBODY who gives this album three full listens, and I'm not talking passive listens, but real full engulfed listens, will not be able to deny that this album is just far more advanced than Deloused could have ever hoped to be. <br /> <br />The fact is that this album is not for passive listeners. If you like Deloused for its rhythm and flow, and you can listen to it without knowing why everypart is as amazing as it is, than maybe this isn't for you. But if you liked the Mars Volta for what they stand for, for what the guitars, bass, drums and vocals are doing at every moment, and for the way they intend to forever change and morph music, than this album should be not only in your possession, but consistently entering your ears.  <br /> <br />Omar himself proclaimed that he wants people who wish to love or hear the Mars Volta to begin listening at this album, calling Deloused \\"adolescent\\" and too regulated. So those of you who liked Mars Volta for being catchy on Deloused, but listen to Frances and turn away, stop now because their third album will not be anything you'd prefer either. But for those of you who loved the art and beauty of Deloused, here is another and a far superior masterpiece waiting to be understood (and good luck because Cassandra Gemini gives you 30 min to unfold).
B00005JMUA|4.0|While i enjoyed vol 2 a whole lot, it did not have that special something like the first one did. But its still a heck of a movie and a great continuation of the first.<br /><br />Darryl Hannahs character was one of my favorites in the movies and her character did not disappoint in vol 2. Bills brother was also great, and he had some memorable scenes, but the final showdown with Bill was a bit of a let down.<br /><br />All in all this is another tremendous movie from QT, that just oozes with originality and style. Bravo to Quentin and his amazingly fun movies!
B0007N1AI6|5.0|One of the best metal albums of all time based on consistency, musicianship and sound.  I recognize JP as the best heavy metal band of all time, though I DO NOT buy everything they put out (i.e. Turbo through Ripper's stuff, though Painkiller had 2 or 3 great tracks). When I listen to all the old Priest classics, which are real classic albums, I tend to skip a song or two, especially some of the ballads.  No skipping on this my friend and not just because it is new.  Halford sounds amazing, even on the stripped down vocal parts - Amazing like 25 years ago. Glen and KK play some of their best leads ever, and Scott Travis (aka Big Man) - is he not one of the best rock drummers ever?
0812550706|5.0|I originally read a short story called Ender's Game in OMNI magazine in the late 70's.  Ender's Game went on to be published as a novel in 1985; and now, nearing 30 years later (20 years after its novelization), it STILL produces discussion, 5-star ratings by readers who were not even born when it was written, and continuing dialogue concerning its applicability to human nature today.  THAT'S what true literature does.  Orson Scott Card is a writer of literature.  Over and OVER again I see, in these reviews and many others, the statement that \\"I am not a sci-fi fan but...\\".  That is as strong an indicator as any other that Ender's Game is a work of literature, not just good writing.  It reaches far beyond the genre of science fiction and speaks to the soul, individually and collectively, of humanity.  Great works of literature do just that.  I remain to this day a dedicated fan of OSC and of his novel Ender's Game.  I highly recommend this book to everyone.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Ok that guy or w/e who tore this album to shreds is just downright STUPID/RETARDED...i bet you i could find 5 albums rite now that shouldn't even be mentioned in same sentence as the mars volta (((SAM PREKOP))) And i doubt accomplished musicians like flea and john frusciante would waste their time on a project that they didnt think would be worthwhile... <br /> <br />Frances The Mute is a new and awesome chapter in the mars volta's careers...And you dont have an open ear to listen to uniquely great music if you think this album isnt any good b/c it and the songs are \\"too long\\" b/c this cd is the best 77 min oddyssey you will ever venture on. PERIOD <br /> <br />
B0007N1AI6|3.0|As a Judas Priest fan since the early 80s, I have to say that I was more than curious to listen to the first orignal Judas Priest product in almost 15 years.  The early press indicated that this record would be a culmination of the musical styles from their entire career.  With that, I would have expected a very schitzophrenic affair, but aside from the artwork, this is no return to the classic 'Sad Wings of Destiny' (1976). <br /> <br />Then again, the last record by the \\"original lineup\\" (Rob Halford, Glenn Tipton, KK Downing, and Ian Hill) did not sound much like the earlier Priest records.  With the addition of then-Racer X drummer, Scott Travis, 'Painkiller' (1990) many then-younger metal fans found the record accessible in light of the then-fashionable speed metal craze.  The older fans found that, with the exception of the title track and \\"Touch of Evil\\", 'Painkiller's lyrics had become too reminescent of Spinal Tap.  Unfortunately, three out of the 10 cuts on this record - including \\"Demonizer\\" and \\"Hellrider\\" - fall directly into the 'Painkiller' formula.  (Inquiring minds want to know - is the Hellrider a card-carrying member of the Hell Patrol, and is the Demonizer the same mythical beast as The Night Crawler?)   So if you liked the speedy riffs, rolling drums, and inane lyrics of 'Painkiller', by all means, did in.  For the rest of us, only \\"Judas Rising\\" is viable. <br /> <br />The most blatant attempt at returning to the epics of the 70s era (like \\"Victim of Changes\\", \\"Sinner\\", \\"Beyond the Realm of Death\\") is the 13-minute finale \\"Eulogy/Lochness.\\"  Unfortunately, the lyrics are painfully laughable for the the long-time Judas Priest fan, sounding like some of Black Sabbath's and Dio's worst (later) work. <br /> <br />\\"Deal with the Devil\\" and \\"Wheels of Fire\\" are definitely reminescent of Judas Priest in the 1980s.  Unfortunately, these songs fall into the latter-1980s, where their songs became TOO self-conscious (i.e., \\"Boy, we are gonna ROCK YOU!!!\\").  In fact, both of those songs would sound right at home on 'Ram It Down' (1988), and some of the lyrics of \\"Deal with the Devil\\" come right from that record's finale, \\"Monsters of Rock\\".  So if you liked 'Ram It Down' . . . <br /> <br />However, 'Angel of Retribution' IS a decent album when the band DOES break out of the mold.  \\"Revolution\\" is one of the better anthems in their catalog - in the vein of two semi-successful singles from their early days, \\"Take on the World\\" and \\"United\\" - but with a bit of a more modern sound.  Another standout is the stripped-down mid-tempo ballad (of sorts), \\"Worth Waiting For\\", the records top contender for a commercially viable single.  Although not as strong, \\"Angel\\" is also a decent ballad that does not fall into excessive cheesiness.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|I already own the first two seasons and can't wait for this one to come out.  The show has been one of my favorites since it aired, and I always make sure I'm home by 7 to watch it every Tuesday.  I love the witty banter and the cultural references are amazing! People always tell me that I talk too fast, but these two girls rival my own motor mouth. =) I will own every season that this show has - I'm addicted!!
B0007GAEW6|5.0|The first thing you need to do with frances the mute is grab your headphones and absorb without any distractions. Only then will you experience the amazing journey that TMV gives you on this album. If your a fan of their first full length album deloused in the comatorium, than theres no reason why this one shouldn't give you the same if not more satisfaction. Although this one does require a little more patience(to the common ear) than their previous work, i guarantee you after a few spins it will become one of your favorite albums ever. Much like Pink Floyds dark side of the moon, this one gives you that bombastic sound with a latin influence, more intricate guitar solos than deloused, perfect drumming, and the most unique and awesome vocalist today!!!!  <br /> <br />For anyone new to THE MARS VOLTA EXPERIENCE, do start with Tremulant their e.p. and follow in the same order of album release, but if you really want to understand what this band is all about, go see them LIVE and you will understand why TMV is already considered one of the best bands ever.
B0002X314C|4.0|This is an excellent cd.  If I could, I would give it 4 1/2 stars.  I was expecting to like only 2 or 3 songs, but found myself enjoying most of the material.  \\"Used to love you\\", \\"Let's get lifted\\", \\"She don't have to know\\", \\"Number one\\", \\"I can change\\", \\"ordinary people\\" and \\"so high\\" are my favorites.  The other songs are good ones, also.  What really impresses me the most is that it flows incredibly well.  The songs are arranged in a way that it seems that John Legend is telling a story.  If you like R & B mixed with a little hip hop, buy this album.  This is like Alicia Keys' \\"Diary\\"; that's a cd I would also recommend.
B0007MVXQG|5.0|I'm feeling old remembering how long ago its been since the last priest album came out with Halford on Vocals. Painkiller was heavy metal all the way...almost too much, if that's possible. It was a CD that put priest back on the map but left a lot to be desired if one was hoping to hear similar songs in the vein of their classic 70's work, such as Sad Wings of Destiny. So 14 years later Priest return with a release that's heavy enough for this day and dynamic enough to call upon some most excellent song writing reminicent of the 70's epics such as beyond the realms of death. I've only listened to the CD twice and every song is up to par. Even in their most accessable and comercial moments, they manage to pull off some amazing riffs. No complaints with this one. I'm honored to have Angel of Retribution in my colection and I'm once again a die hard Priest fan. This may be my favorite CD of theirs next to Screaming for Vengence.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Steven Spielberg's (\\"JAWS,\\" \\"Indiana Jones Trilogy\\" [fourth one coming soon], \\"Jurassic Park,\\" \\"E.T.,\\" \\"Jurassic Park II,\\" etc) adaptation of Thomas Keneally's moving account of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson, \\"STAR WARS Episode I,\\" etc; in the role that should've garnered him the Oscar for Best Actor), war profiteer, womanizer/Nazi party member and his fight to save as many Jews as he could from the Holocaust. The movie also stars Ralph Fiennes (brother of Joseph) as the evil Amon Goeth, exuding pure malice as one of the most sadistic German captains of the evil Nazi regime (should've won Best Supporting Actor; no disrespect to Tommy Lee Jones, who won for \\"The Fugitive.\\") Oscar-winner Ben Kingsley (\\"Ghandi,\\" etc) also stars as Itzhak Stern, Schindler's secretary. The movie is very sad in its hard-hitting account of the suffering the Germans put the Jews through during \\"Six long years of murder\\" and the man who fought to rescue them. The movie was filmed in black and white, not only because the violence would have been too graphic in color, but because that was Steven's vision of the film. The film's most poignant moments came at the end (I'm not spoiling it). John Williams' magnificent and heart-wrenching score (accompanied by Itzhak Perlman's heart-felt violin solos) resonates with you long after the end credits roll. Recently honored at the Kennedy Center Honors, Itzhak Perlman played John Williams' score from \\"Schindler's List\\" after saying a few things, looking up and saying \\"John, this one's for you,\\" before a medley of his most popular film scores was played (\\"Raiders Of The Lost Ark,\\" \\"E.T.,\\" \\"Superman\\" and of course, \\"STAR WARS\\"). Special features include a \\"Voices Of The Holocaust\\" documentary hosted by Steven Spielberg, cast and crew bios/credits and more. What's really lacking is a making-of documentary, cast/crew interviews and trailers. The film earned the seven Oscars it won in 1993, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Score. The DTS 5.1 track on the DVD is excellent, as it allows you to experience the grittiness of the picture exactly as Steven intended. The anamorphic widescreen enhances the quality of the picture even more. This movie is DEFINITELY NOT FOR CHILDREN!! Rated R for intense thematic elements involving the Holocaust, graphic violence, disturbing images, language, brief sexuality and nudity.ck on the DVD is excellent, as it allows you to experience the grittiness of the picture exactly as Steven intended.

B0007GAEW6|5.0|The overwhelming skill of TMV is obvious on 'Frances'. After 'Deloused' i was counting the days till the release of this album and i was not disappointed. the fresh sounds are something to get used to if you are not an avid fan of TMV or ATDI, but after a straight listen through i was able to say it was a worthy follow up. there is a great flow from one song to the next all the way through. this is a must have for any fan of new and innovative sounds.
B0002OERI0|5.0|It's funny the reviews from morons saying this is about hating America. Americans are idiots, haven't you noticed? <br /> <br />I'd heard 'Holiday' and 'American Idiot' on the radio and loved it. After the Grammy I thought I'd have a listen. <br /> <br />It's amazing - usually the further a band gets in it's career the more it sounds the same. They dug deep, wrote a 'rock opera' album and pulled off a blistering, melodic snapshot of our time.  <br /> <br />If you don't get it, read the lyrics, and keep listening. If you still don't get it, you must have a 'Support Our Troops' bumper sticker.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|The movie did to me what it was supposed to do, entertain. i got turned off when i saw the first 5 min of the movie, but i gave it the benifit of the doubt, and it was worth watching, don't buy thought, its a one time see thing. <br />i wish angelina jolie had a bigger role, i'm not a big fan or anything, it's just that, for some reaseon, i pay extra attention to her ever since i watched tomb raider I, i hated the 2nd. any way the movie is uniqley and different in a catoonish kind of reality......
0393035158|5.0|Forget the sexual revolution, the class revolution, or any other fights for freedom, because we are in the early stages of the greatest battle human culture has seen, the battle between the natural and the supernatural, the rational and the irrational, and Sam Harris, with his magnificent book 'The End Of Faith' has dared to fire the first shot. And what a shot it is. At last, here is a book that gives religious doubters food for thought. Informed, witty, yet angry at the same time, Harris lifts the lid on the greatest taboo of our times   Not content with merely having a go at religion, Mr Harris skilfully weaves in connected thoughts about neuroscience, drug use and future possibilities for mankind. As important a book as Dawkins 'The Selfish Gene', Lovelocks 'Gaia', Howard Bloom's 'The Lucifer Principle' and Matt Ridley's 'The Origins Of Virtue', I urge you to dare to read 'The End Of Faith' and open your mind.
B00006RCNW|5.0|I didn't start watching the show until the 1st season came out on DVD, and from the very start of the 1st episode I was hooked to it. This is in my opinion without doubt will rank as one of the best shows in the history of TV. <br />Michael Chiklis just blows me away every time he portrays Vic Mackey. Well don't take my word for it, go and see the show yourself and I will guarantee my whole paycheck that you won't be disappointed.
B000002OX7|5.0|For a band that originally released this album, way back in 1977, it's a testament to the incredibly articulate writing skills of \\"Pete Townsend\\", and the Exuberant, Passionate and Visceral performances of all concerned, that this album, is still amongst the definitive examples of Hard-Rock / Album Rock template, that startles some 30 years later.  <br /> <br />Its a driving and insistent album, with the band truly hitting their stride (and largely considered to be their best work), with elements of Blues-Rock, Hard-Rock, acoustic flavoured workouts, Country-tinged shuffles & Earnest Ballads, combining to make an album that captures elements of the band's personality, and most invigorating performances.  <br /> <br />Whether it be the anthemic \\"Baba O'Riley that is a massive statement of intent, with all the bombastic flurry and major chord workouts that you'd expect, but with the significant use of synthesizer's on this band (Pete was constantly working to refine their sound). Or the totally stomping album-Rock  <br />of \\"Bargain\\", with Keith Moon's furious drumming (proving himself to be as accomplished a drummer, as I've ever heard), along with John Entwistle delivering all kinds of melodic and rhythmic flourishes, and the soaring chorus of \\"The best I've ever Had\\", it's hard not to feel an emotional lump on the throat when hearing this.  <br /> <br />precise & emotionally poignant balladry is the order of the day for \\"The Song is Over\\", and as aptly as The Who can deliver intricate Hard Rock, they also prove themselves to be equally adept at delivering a ballad that doesn't feel force or contrived. As everything here (instrumentation-wise) is far more subtle & less flamboyant, and as sorrowful, emotionally charged and heartbreaking, and sung from the heart, as all the finest ballad should be, and to have a chorus that sings \\"I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea\\", and not sound musically misplaced, is another feather in the cap of the songwriting skills of Townshend.  <br /> <br />Surprising that it may seem, my personal favourite on this album is the Country-tinged Blues rock of \\"Going Mobile\\" which although there are no weak tracks on this album, I feel that this track frequently gets passed over by most, in favour of the more well-known / Established tracks. Its the use of a Bluegrass twang to the guitar instrumentation that feels so freewheeling, that It's not hard to picture the imagine of mobile travellers (of which the song is in reference to), with a lyrical bent that not only is quite witty in its construction \\"I can pull up by the curb, I can make it on the road, Goin' mobile, I can stop in any street, And talk with people that we meet, Goin' mobile.....Keep me movin\\". Show a layer of complexity in the songwriting, for what is essentially one of the lesser known tracks on the album, and the relatively high tempo song, and whirling folky guitars and graceful country flourishes thoroughout the track mask the tongue-in-cheek humour, that is as captivating as it is funny, for it hard not to raise a smile when at the 'Leave it all behind' mentality surfaces on the lyric \\"I don't care about pollution, I'm an air-conditioned gypsy, That's my solution, Watch the police and the tax man miss me....I'm mobile\\".  <br /> <br />The second Ballad \\"Behind Blue eyes\\", (That would later be covered by Limp Bizkit on his \\"Results may Vary\\" album), is arguably as accomplished a ballad as \\"The Song is Over\\" (possibly even surpassing it, due to it more stripped-down aesthetic, and rather more reliance on acoustic arrangement). And the album closer \\"Won't get Fooled again\\" is possibly one of the strongest cuts, to finish the album out on. A largely rock delivered anthem, that at 8 minutes long, you'd be fooled into thinking that It's overreaching itself, but the combination of all the musicians involved, moving constantly through various stylistic changes, the prominent use of the synthesizer's, stunning drumming and slick guitar work, along with some fine worded lyrics \\"I'll tip my hat to the new constitution, Take a bow for the new revolution, Smile and grin at the change all around, Pick up my guitar and play Just like yesterday\\", showed a band, at the very height of their musical prowess, no question about it.  <br /> <br />If you haven't heard this album before (for some reason), then for an album devised in the 70's, you'd be forgiven for thinking that It might sound horribly dated now, but just like other astonishing albums in that were published in the highly creative 70's period (Led Zeppelin's - \\"Physical Graffiti\\", Can's - \\"Tago Mago\\", Neil Young's - \\"After the Gold Rush\\", David Bowie's - \\"Ziggy Stardust\\", Pink Floyd's - \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", Nick Drake - Bryter Layter\\", Marvin Gaye's - What's Going On\\", Stevie Wonder's - \\"Innervisions\\", The Velvet Underground's - Loaded)......as albums that resfuse to sound dated or irrelevant in the face of new methods of musical recordings or changes in the musical tastes of the general public. Arguably the finest album that they recorded (although some may disagree), this is one of those albums that frequently charts in those \\"Greatest Albums Ever\\" polls that you frequently come across in magazines or Websites, and that because it's really is one of the truly great albums, to have been ever made, and anyone even remotely thinking about collecting a rock collection of albums, cannot consider it complete until they have this astonishing album.
0345347951|5.0|\\"Childhood's End\\" is often called of one the best science fiction stories of all time. I am a huge science fiction fan, and after reading this book, I will gladly call it THE best. <br /> <br />Clarke is somewhat unusual among science fiction writers in that he a brilliant technique in addition to his brilliant ideas. The utter realism and plausibility of his fiction is striking, and in the case of \\"Childhood's End,\\" frightening. <br /> <br />It's fascinating to see how well this story, written in the 1940s, holds up without being dated. Only the occasional reference to radar ranges or the predominance of radio makes Clarke's work seem less than contemporary. The great similarities to the TV miniseries \\"V\\" and the blockbuster film \\"Independence Day\\" make one wonder why Clarke has not sued for plagiarism. <br /> <br />This is a well-written, thought-provoking, thoroughly engrossing book.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|As someone who thinks their first 2 CD's where among the top 20 heavy metal CD's of all time, let me say I was very disapointed when I got this one. There are even a couple songs with a lame acoustic guitar! <br />Then I liked a couple songs. Now after many listenings, I love it. There a few stinkers in there. Even though it's not as heavy and fast as their first 2, it has grown on me to become an awesome CD. <br />
B0000214F0|5.0|Caligula is classic. The whole movie os one perversion after another. The only thing that separates the sex scenes is the violence and the buffoonery. If you have that special girl that hates or won't watch porn movies with you, give this a try. It's basiclly the most high budget porno ever made. After it's over you can strip down naked, march around with your arm strecthed out with the thumbs up, and see what happens.<br /><br />By far the best scene is the Roman orgy with the senator's wives. Holy moly for only 5 gold coins you could do whatever you wanted to them.<br /><br />The 'wedding gift' from the emporer is also pure lunacy. To not only have your new bride, but you yourself lose your virginity to the emporer is a night you'd never forget. I just hope he washed his ring when he was done.<br /><br />All in all this movie is insane. Not for the timid hearted and definately not for prudes. If you enjoy historic films, maybe this will have some interest for you. If you're just a perve, this should be one of your all time favorites.
0812550706|5.0|When I wanted advice on how to lead people, I turned to this book.  One of the most important things I learned from it was that a good leader does not need to make stupid threats.  I feel that it transcends science fiction in a way that nothing else in the genre does, excepting of course the Dune series, and it really invites the reader in.  I was very well satisfied when I was done, and it is a book I can keep reading with major interest unabated.  I was incredibly happy when I learned that the story was being expanded and lengthened with the stories of Bean and Peter Wiggin, and those are also incredibly essential reads.  I don't think much of the books that are older that came after this one, like Xenocide, but if that is your thing than check it out. <br /> This is the book that kindled my interest in the genius of Orson Scott Card.  Highly recommended for everyone, and one of the few fiction books I have real respect for.
0385510438|3.0|In \\"The Last Juror,\\" John Grisham attempts to blend the style of the legal thrillers which made his career with the old-fashioned and atomspheric quality of \\"The Painted House.\\" The result is not unsuccessful, but it's also not up to Grisham's usual standard. <br /> <br />Grisham tries to capture the feeling of rural Mississippi in the 1970s, but his descriptions aren't very period-specific; the story could be taking place at any point in the past 60 years. Sentences are often confusingly constructed, as if Grisham wrote the novel in a hurry and didn't edit it. Miss Callie is a nicely drawn, complex character, but the rest of the cast is superficial by comparison. <br /> <br />The dust jacket tries to play up the suspense element: \\"...men and women who served on a jury nine years ago are starting to die one by one--as a killer exacts the ultimate revenge.\\" But don't be fooled: the killing of jurors doesn't begin until the last fifth of the book. I'm terrible at figuring out mysteries, but the identity of this killer was obvious even to me. <br /> <br />Grisham tries to throw too much into the mix: life in rural Mississippi, desegregation, Vietnam, a discourse on Southern churches, an expose of the legal and parole system in Mississippi in the 1970s, a Wal-Mart style incursion -- all in addition to his legal story. There is so much material that nothing can be treated in depth. Nothing, that is, except the marvelous descriptions of Southern cuisine. <br /> <br />\\"The Last Juror\\" is an enjoyable read, but it is not up to the quality I have come to expect from such a fine author as John Grisham.
B0002O06N0|5.0|Upon my first listen to tracks like \\"All Against..\\" and \\"10 am...\\" I was completely stunned and could not believe this music was released in 2004 instead of 1968.After hearing \\"De Stijl\\" by the Stripes I thought I had heard modern blues rock at the best it could get.But after hearing this album,I've had a change in heart.This is just incredible rock and roll music which offers so many different tempos which all work.Even the slide guitar on the slow number \\"Lengths\\" will just tug at your insides.The solo in the middle of \\"Desparate Man\\" eerily reflects something Hendrix would do,and the fact that it sounds amazing and not like a rip off,is just a trip.The hands off production really works on here and just shows that less is more.Like many have already said,the fuzzy tone just cooks wonders on all the tracks.The guy,his name escapes me,has an incredible voice which was made for this kind of rock.It doesn't take any getting used to,as supposed to the singer in Kings Of Leon.If you really dig the music of Cream,Hendrix,and Skynyrd then this is definitely worth checking out.I am so glad I discovered this band,music this genuine,pure,raw,and rockin' is too rare to come by these days.          ...and could everybody please stop trashing the opening track,its a kick arse tune and ofneof the best on the album!
B0002VKZL6|4.0|This is not the best Knopfler has ever put out. In fact, on the first listen I didn't like the first half at all. But the second half just blew me away. His lyrics are so packed with imagery. All in all I am pleased to have this recording. And as always, his sidemen are perfect. It does make me anxious for new stuff from the man.
B00005JMAH|2.0|I just couldn't get myself to be enthusiastic about this movie.<br /><br />The atmosphere was so much less magical than in the first two films, mainly because the main characters wear the same \\"civilian\\" clothes and look dishevelled most of the time, but also because they had to hire a new actor as Professor Dumbledore. Hogwarts will never be the same without Richard Harris :(<br /><br />It also seems the director took the \\"dark film\\" idea literally: there are too many gloomy sets and cloudy skies in this movie.<br /><br />And the special effects - well, I admit I'm spoiled by LoTR, but the creatures just didn't move right (with the exception of the Dementors).<br /><br />I hope so much they'll hire Chris Columbus again to do the next film!
B00065LY1I|4.0|After a rather successful run with three hit albums under EMI, this comprehensive hits collection is released. Although there have been  greatest hits and remix collections from the past, none would have represented Kylie's career better than this.<br /><br />Split into two discs of 33 tracks, Disc 1 primarily focuses on the songs of the 80's hit team of Stock, Aitken and Waterman - the UK equivalent of Babyface, Antonio Reid and Darryl Simmons of the US. These people are the hitmaking factory that produced people like Bananrama and Rick Astley. The tracklist on the US edition is the same but the order of the songs are slightly altered and 7\\" mixes are used for Locomotion and What Do I Have To Do? (they don't make much of a difference though). While SAW typically produced songs that had catchy chorus and lyrics that talk about prepubescent love and loss, it's rather enjoyable listening to the colossal amount of recordings Kylie did with them between 87-92. Honorable mentions go to the Little Eva remake of Locomotion, I Should Be So Lucky, Got To Be Certain, Especially For You (with 80's male Kylie equivalent Jason Donovan) and Better  The Devil You Know. Though mostly fluffy, these danceable songs are made just for its intended audience. It's No Secret is missing even though it was released in the US and hit Top 40.<br /><br />By 1990's Better The Devil You Know, Kylie had taken a turn with slightly more mature dance tracks, the kind you would have expected in the early 90's, slightly kitsch and a little over-the-top.<br /><br />Disc 2 presents a slightly more ecletic Kylie. Beginning with her newest single, I Believe in You, co-written with Babydaddy and Jake Shears of Scissor sisters, the splendid song showcased another step further into Kylie's interest with electronic dance music, a worthy continuation from Fever. The rest of the selections include the mystic Confide In Me, Breathe and Did It Again (from her underrated indie Impossible Princess album), the comeback single Spinning Around and their followup (from Light Years, previously not released in the US), the worldwide smash Can't Get You Out Of My Head and Love AT First Sight (Fever) and the trio of hits such as the uber sensual Slow and Chocolate from Body Language, which was sadly underrated too. Look out for her new single Giving it Up, the other new song from this set.<br /><br />This is definitely a comprehensive 2-disc hits collection from Kylie. 18 years in the chequered career of one of Australia's most prominent star.nd and their followup (from Light Years, previously not released in the US), the worldwide smash Can't Get You Out Of My Head and Love AT First Sight (Fever) and the trio of hits such as the uber sensual Slow and Chocolate from Body Language, which was sadly underrated too.

B0007N1AI6|4.0|Overall, I'd say this is not as good as Painkiller, though it is certainly better than anything Priest did with Owens.  Glad to see Rob back, and I was fortunate to see them at Ozzfest last year on the reunion tour.  I was also fortunate to see Rob on his solo gig a few years before that, touring with Maiden.  For a 50-something, the man can still belt out the tunes.  As for this album, it's worth what I paid for it, 13 bucks.  If you pay 25 for it then you got ripped off.  There are some good songs here, though not much in the way of memorable riffs.  I think their days of good riffs might be behind them.  The solos aren't bad and after 30 years they finally let Ian do a little bass stuff(very little).  There are probably as many good songs on this album as Painkiller and if, God willing, there were ever a way other than cd-burning to merge these two albums and track list the best songs from both, then you'd really have something to blow your doors off.  That said, I hope the boys learn that on the next outing(if there is one and I'm sure their will be) they should leave the references to older songs out of the lyrics and there is more to metal than songs about metal.  Buy this and if you are a hardcore fan, you will probably be satisfied for the most part.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|Very nice DVD set - but Amazon is right: this is a region 1 DVD only, so only viewable in the US. Alternatively, if you are outside the US, you can have your DVD player \\"operated\\", and remove the region thingy...
B0007O38F8|1.0|LISTEN UP PEOPLE!!!!! <br /> <br />    This entire week you can go to MTV.com and preview the ENTIRE cd on \\"the Leak\\". I implore you to do so. This cd is weak AT BEST! The tracks \\"I'm Supposed To Live Tonight\\", \\"Disco Inferno\\", and \\"Hate It Or Love It(G Unit Remix)\\" are the only songs that you might want to hear more than once. I'm not a hater of 50 cent. I believe he's talented artist, but this cd was just a waste of his time and, if you purchase it, your money.
B0001MDQ2G|5.0|yes, in September 2005 at ProgPower 6 in Atlanta, GA Check out [...] for more info. and DON'T NISS THIS SHOW! these guys rock!
B0007N1AI6|4.0|Alright HEAVY-METAL MANIACS, stop what you are doing and go buy this CD! Don't be cheap, get the version with the BONUS DVD.  You will get more for your money and you won't put your CD PLAYER at risk.  There has already been complaints about these so called DUAL-DISC versions which have the CD portion on one side and the DVD portion on the other.  Now back to this awesome METAL album-This is classic Priest! The METAL GOD is back where he belongs and it shows on this soon to be Priest classic.  I only gave this 4 stars because I feel that there could have been more tracks, but you do get a 13+ minute long rocker on track 10 called LOCHNESS.  Track 1 starts off with Rob Halfords classic scream blended with K.K. Downing and Glenn Tiptons awesome guitar playing.  This track is called JUDAS RISING which is definately a good come-back song.  Track 2-DEAL WITH THE DEVIL and 3-REVOLUTION also rock.  Track 4-WORTH FIGHTING FOR is a slower eighties style ballad.  Track 5-DEMONIZER and 6-WHEELS OF FIRE will make you want to jump in your car and floor it! Track 7-ANGEL is very slow, but has great vocals! Track-8 HELLRIDER is Scott Travis at his best on drums since Painkiller.  Ian Hill does more than his fair share on Bass throughout the whole album.  Track-9 EULOGY shortly prepares you for the grand finaly which is track-10 LOCHNESS! When you are through rockin' to the CD you can then crank up your DVD which by the way sounds great in 5.1 DIGITAL SURROUND SOUND-you do have a home theatre system don't you? The DVD gives you a 40+ minute documentary from the REUNITED TOUR 2004 and seven live classics BREAKING THE LAW, METAL GODS, A TOUCH OF EVIL, HELL BENT FOR LEATHER, THE HELLION/ELECTRIC EYE, DIAMONDS AND RUST, and LIVING AFTER MIDNIGHT.  Buy and crank it up, for The Priest Is Back!

B0007O38F8|4.0|I think all of Ja Rule's cousins need to back away from their computers!!  I think the main reason for all of the Fiddy hate is his cocky attitude.  I know...I know...how dare he proclaim himself king, and challenge everybody who crosses him. <br />But let's put personal feelings aside.  Although Massacre is no Get Rich...its still pretty darn good.  Fiddy isn't as tight a lyricist as Nas or Jadakiss...but his melodic flow and wit more than makes up for that.  He takes the same old hood tales and makes them fresh again.  I enjoy listening to him and hearing what he's going to say next. <br />Go Fiddy, Massacre is hot. <br />
B00005KFUM|5.0|Muse have been threatening to explode for a while now... both on and offstage. Their latest album \\"Absolution\\" finally made it to American shores and to no one's surprise... has been well receieved. Unfortunately, the omission of their first two album's within America has slowed their plans for world domination. Amazon doesnt even have any track samples!?!! But, \\"Origin of Symmetry\\" the second album, is arguably their best work.    Origin of Symmetry, sees the trio band... Chris, Dom and frontman Matt Bellamy... travel to the end of time and back. Its an epic adventure... Space Odyssey style... Grandiose and ambitious.     Matt Bellamy is known for his wacky theories and love for space, evolution, religion and physics... in this album, he proceeds to take his audience to places most books could never envision let alone express.     It starts with the angelic \\"New Born\\". Beginning with the flickering of piano notes, staging the formation of life. It quickly turns to an all out rainbow effect... beautifully capturing an array of emotions (agony, confusion, defiance, madness). It is brilliant. It is a description of life through expression of music.     The second track 'Bliss' draws from the first, as Matt Bellamy waves his magic wand he summons a whirlwind that lifts life onto the world stage. Yes folks, you have just experienced the birth of life. As the video clip implies, it plays like a gravitational pull. Falling through time and space...    The third track 'Space dementia' feels like a ripple in the seam. It begins poised, but suddenly rips into a fast paced spread of destruction. Matt literally screams like a baby, the new born momentarily innocent, pure and peaceful is now quickly contaminated. The environment polluting its existence.      'hyper music' and 'plug in baby' are products of human experiences, the effects of earthly existence... Love and Hate.      'Citizen erased' (probably the best part of this vast voyage) ventures to the borders of life and death. Someone is kneeling to GOD here... and pleading for his\her life. Like the song itself, it jumps between the realms of pain and beauty, death as we know it maybe.     'Micro Cuts' is the haunting truth, the inevitable outcome of the previous track, life has not been granted. There is panic, the guillotine awaits, eyes covered, hands cuffed. There is no escape but just immense pain and sorrow. As expressed by the turmoil in Matt's voice.     Whilst 'micro cuts' was an immediate reaction, 'Screenager' is the creepy, dark, long and lonely wait. \\"Stop your screaming no one can hear\\". This is the night before the end...death awaits.... what to feel? .... cold, helpless, accepting (maybe even embracing what is to come).    'Dark shines' plays like a walk through death town.. the lights have gone out. Darkness has prevailed.... wOOHOOOOOO... tell me you havent been succumb already!!    'Feeling good', a Nina Simone cover is cleverly placed here. Its a new dawn... new life. A new start. IS this Reincarnation? Is it life transferred to new frontiers.    'Megalomania' is the closing credits to a fantastic journey. An absolutely beautiful finale to an absolute gorgeous world that is 'Origin of Symmetry'. The tempo builds to a crashing percussion, a supernova at its finest hour! And amongst all this perhaps subtle hints of a return to evilness... a 'Clockwork orange' ending. Or perhaps a message that 'things will never change'.     Muse's journey to the Origin of Symmetry, is a mind boggling musical expedition to the outer boundaries... It is truly breathtaking. I haven't even talked about the catchy melodies that unfold or the sheer energy that these three young men are able to yield. The genious of Matt's finger coordination like a caterpillar on pills speeding across the piano, his razor sharp scissor hands on the guitar, or his spectacular voice raising over what often feels like a musical stage... that is about to lift off like a spaceship.     And then there is theLive aspect of Muse (O.O.Symmetry playing a large part), which is undoubtly their strongest asset. Their night shows, encapsulating a smorgasboard of stunning visuals and a beautiful array of lighting effects, like some psychedlic 70's disco space arena... it has even seen a call for a return to stadium rock!    And lets not forget to mention Matt's charismatic 'over the top' antics, sliding across the stage like Marty Mcfly (Back to the Future), effortlessly swaying his oversized guitar like a MANGA character weilding an axe, and doing the splits mid air whilst in the middle of a riff... no wonder Muse have cleaned up Best live act at Q, NME, MTV europe, FESTIVAL, and British awards this last year!!!    I could go on forever about their live performance, but Ill end with one important note. Matt's antics onstage are parallel to BMW's motto for car aesthetics... functionality first. Matt doesnt repeatedly headbang, wave his torso pointlessly, or swivel his guitar between notes... his actions are an extension of his music. The timing is relevant and the motions are always functional in an attempt to express his music. Most muse fans will tell you, you havent finished hearing Muse until you see them live. That, amongst all the mundane 70's and Nu metal clones out there, you just dont find anymore.
B00005JN4H|3.0|\\"Taxi (2004)\\" puts Queen Latifah (Belle) and Jimmy Fallon (Washburn) together for the big screen. Queen Latifah was on Saturday Night Live and worked with Jimmy Fallon. Director Tim Story said the have great chemistry, so he decided to make \\"Taxi.\\"<br /><br />\\"Taxi (2004)\\" takes the non-driving, keystone cop Washburn and ultra, taxi mechanic Belle on a high speed chase to track down four supermodel bank robbers.  The bank robbers are lead by Vanessa. (Gisele Bundchen)<br /><br />This movie has a few gut busting laughs but overall lacks comedic discipline. Adlib is usually funny if it fits the right character. Jimmy Fallon (Washburn) goes over the edge as the inept police officer. Queen Latifah fits nicely in her character. The slick, transforming yellow taxicab takes center stage though and is more interesting than the movie. Can you actually get over 25 mph on the streets of New York?<br /><br />Ann Margaret (Washburn's alcoholic mother) is true to form as her character. The love him or hate him NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon also makes a special cameo.
B000005RS0|5.0|I own this album, on album (vinyl). I'm glad I waited to get THIS edition on cd; the extra songs are great. I was pleasantly surprised by her cover of 'Help', by the Beatles (not included on vinyl).   The cover of Al Green's, 'Let's Stay Together', is great. A must listen for those who haven't heard it or the original (even if your not a fan of the original). Tina, is, \\"simply the best\\"!   'I Might Have Been Queen', 'What's Love Got To Do With  It', 'Better Be Good To Me', '1984', 'Steel Claw', and 'I Can't Stand The Rain' (both the original and the extended version) are the standout tracks on this terrific cd! The listener won't be disappointed.
1401301010|1.0|I like the red hot chili pepper's and I like autoabiographies. That being said this one is slow, not well organized and uinspiring. I kept reading, convinced that it had to get better, unfortunately, it never did. It took me 3 weeks to get through, when a book never takes me longer than a few days. Anthony Kedis should stick to making music.
B00005JNEW|4.0|\\"Friday Night Lights (2004)\\" is based on a true story. H.G. Bissinger is the author. Deep in the heart of West Texas nothing else matters when high school football is on. City versus city put their bragging rights on the line when high school rivalries clash. If you do not bring home the championship you are considered a loser!<br /><br />The 1988 Odessa Permian High School football team is followed for the year. Their trial and tribulations are documented to see what it takes for the quest of a championship ring. Four seniors take to the field for their final football season. The quarterback Mike Winchell (Lucas Black), Wide receiver Don Billingsley (Garret Hedlund), Safety Brian Chavez (Jay Hernandez) and running back Boobie Miles (Derek Luke) The state football championship is in their sights. And nothing less will suffice. Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thorton) is given advice from past players and boosters who actually won championships from previous years. And they will settle for nothing less than the championship ring.<br /><br />\\"Friday Night Lights\\" is filmed with in your face football action. The realistic action sequences bring this film to life. This leads to one drawback.  The film starts to focus more on the action scenes then bringing out the quality dramas that exist between the characters. The stress to perform for a city, players and parents could have been more developed. But Tim McGraw (Charles Billingsley) as the drunken parent of wide receiver Don Billingsley puts in a quality performance.<br /><br />Being from a small town myself I can relate to high school sports being on the front page of everyone. A state championship year can keep that expectation high for years to come. What if? This DVD is a quality football must see!
0440237688|4.0|I realy enjoyed reading this book. It started off a bit confusing but as the story progressed, everthing began to fall into place and make sense. This was one of those books that keeps you thinking about it for several days after you read it. It involves a way of life unimaginable to the standard person and really presesnt the question \\"what if...\\" I would recommend this book to younger readers with an imagination.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|If you haven't already bought this album, you're doing yourself a diservice.  It is the best album that has been released since De Loused in the Comatorium hit the shelves.  It also contains one of the truly epic songs ever recorded in \\"Cassandra Gemini.\\"  This song alone exceeds a Strokes album in length, yet it never seems to become repetitive.  It is also full of energy throughout the entire song and never seems to lose steam.  It is the perfect finale to the best album out right now. <br /> <br />My ratings: <br /> <br />Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus:  10/10 <br />The Widow:  7.5/10 <br />L'Via L'Viaquez:  9/10 <br />Miranda, The Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore:  8.5/10 <br />Cassandra Gemini:  10/10 (Best song on the CD.

B000683VI4|5.0|My wife recommended this movie saying them it would make me feel good, and she was right. This is a wonderful story that starts out as a kind of love separated by economic class which doesn't matter to the teenagers Noah and Allie. Allie's parents however diaapprove and move her away but years pass and Noah and Allie never really stop loving each other.<br /><br />The story goes back and forth between present day and the 1940's with James Garner and Gina Rowlands playing an older couple in a rest home. The premise of the story is that Gina Rowlands has dementia and James Garner (Duke) spends his time reading her a story of a long-ago romance. Occasionally Gina remembers that the story that is being read to her is that of her own romance with Duke. While Duke and Gina have children and Grand Childen that want Duke to go home, Duke insists on staying with his true love. Duke lives for these few fleeting moments because this is all he wants are these moments when Gina remembers. This is one of the best romantic movies I have ever seen. And yes the scenery in South Carolina is incredible.
B0007O38F8|5.0|i am sick of people hating on someone cause they are talented.  some people just need to learn to listen to different types of music and have a variety of interests.  most of these haters give 5 stars to their favorite artists and give 1 star to everyone else and hate on that person cause they are jealous.  it is pathetic when people do that cause it shows how pathetic the person is.

The songs on this album are crafted together in a very emotional, and organic way.  The imense sounscapes drip with heart and bare honesty.  While Deloused may have been a bit more \\"rockin\\" and easier to listen to, Francis is more of an intense, personal journey through the core of Mars Volta. ANYONE who enjoyed Deloused can find many of the same draws in this album.  However Frances the Mute really branches out into some abstract musical concepts, and sets The Mars Volta even further apart from any other band today.  Musically and spiritually,this album blew me away.  The Mars Volta are at the height of their musical creativity and invite everyone to sample a taste of something a little different and truley genius
B00000ILDE|5.0|Sigourney Weaver triumphantly returns as Ripley in James Cameron's \\"ALIENS.\\" Ripley wakes up only to find that she has been asleep for 60 years! Then, the spaceship that she is on wants her to return to a planet with the very same aliens that tried to kill her before! \\"ALIENS\\" is 1,000,000 times better than \\"ALIEN\\" and is filled with marveolus punch lines and scares! James Cameron really serves up a treat! See this film - skip out on \\"ALIEN.\\" The only reason for watching it is backstory for \\"ALIENS.\\" \\"ALIEN\\" sucks. <br /> <br />\\"ALIENS\\"
B000003TA4|1.0|Despite the inexplicable praise they have recieved from rock critics and the media, I have no problem voicing my sincere hatred and utter loathing for the Seattle grunge band Nirvana.  Whoever unlocked a studio door and handed a recording contract to these talentless @sses should be held accountable for the nu metal fad most rock radio listeners had to endure as the 1990s came to a close.Nirvana were nothing more than a record company's marketing ploy.  Just like Linkin Park is to the 21st century, Nirvana were to the 90s.  This was the original corporate mallcore band, tailor made by a record company to exploit and take advantage of the public's stupidity.  Just like Korn or Linkin Park today, Nirvana pandered to a bunch of snobby suburban rich kids, who thought their life was miserable just because their parents wouldn't drive them to the mall.  By 1992, just about every member of GenerationXhad been brainwashed into thinking they were \\"angst ridden\\" and that Nirvana \\"Understood their pain\\" and could \\"realte\\" to them.   <br />WHO DID THESE PEOPLE THINK THEY WERE FOOLING!?Nirvana were the Backstreet Boys of rock!  Their \\"angst ridden\\" image was contrived and manufactured.  Kurt was not an artist, but a shrewd businessman, who manufactured angst and anger, then watered it down for mass consumption!  Make no mistake about it, Kurt and his record company knew EXACTLY what their fans wanted to hear, and they pandered to them with watered down, whiney lyrics about how awful life is.  And all the brainwashed Nirvana fans followed like a brainwashed cult.  Nirvana--the Backstreet Boys of rock!
B00028HBKM|3.0|Clearly one of the most powerful presentations of the Passion story ever put to film, but possibly a little over the top in its graphic depiction.  As a regular reader of the Bible, and researcher in biblical/archelogical history...most points made through the movie rang true, but might be confusing to the Christian newby.  The depiction of the abuse and torture suffered by Jesus, though accurate, was overdone for effect, (in a way familiar to those who viewed Gibson's Braveheart).  Could the same feeling have been passed on, with a few minutes of footage left on the cutting room floor?  Most likely.  This would have also opened the door for more younger teens and children's viewing.  As is, still powerful...put possibly overwelming to the spiritually uninformed and less mature.<br /><br />Robert James Luedke, (Author...Eye Witness: A Fictional Tale of Absolute Truth)
0142800821|2.0|We may all agree that punctuation, counts. After all, even the little hyphen makes a world of difference. Take as an example \\"extra-marital sex\\" vs. \\"extra marital sex.\\" That's a big difference if ever I heard one! <br /> <br />This book, however, erodes its claim to the importance of the rules by letting too many errors slip by. Where were the copy editors? Of course, it is written for the British and the British have differences in those rules.(North Americans say \\"third\\" rather than \\"thirdly\\" and Americans may not place a semicolin in the salutation of a business letter, for example.)  <br /> <br />That notwithstanding, this book should have been proofed to perfection since its theme is \\"zero tolorance\\" for such things. My favorite error is \\"...newspapers who insist on precision...\\"  found on page 35. And by the time you get to page 35, there are a dozen others. <br /> <br />Best to wait for the revised edition. <br /> <br />
B00025ETIW|3.0|Well, I, like many others tripped over My Chemical Romance whilst browsing on Launch. <br />After sampling the tracks available on the CD, I've found more songs I like on it, as well as some that I'm not so keen on. <br />Helena and I'm Not Okay are fantastic, as I'd already surmised. <br />A basic rundown on the songs. An asterix (*) indicates songs that are worth a good listen. ; <br /> <br />*Helena (I never get sick of it, magnificent pacing and sound.) <br /> <br />*Give 'em Hell, Kid (Very energetic, great vocals.) <br /> <br />*To the End (Has an awesome beat.) <br /> <br />*You Know What They do to Guys Like Us in Prison (Great beat, huge launch into rock, terrifically controversial lyrics.) <br /> <br />*I'm Not Okay (Poppy but so catchy, I find my self randomly singing this in class heh-especially the 'Trust me' interlude. Good music vid memories. XD) <br /> <br />The Ghost of You (Eh, so-so, ballad with violent vocals, common sort of sound.) <br /> <br />The Jetset Life is Gonna Kill You (Not the greatest. It's about here that you begin to wonder if all the rest of the songs are going to sound the same.) <br /> <br />Interlude (Gives you a nice break from screaming the lyrics. Rather pretty.) <br /> <br />*Thank You for the Venon (Good fun. Very rocky, good imagery.) <br /> <br />Hang 'em High (A strange wild west start off that suddenly turns garbled. Gets sort of annoying after the twelth \\"She won't stop me put it down.\\" They manage to save it a little with slower chorus vocals, but then the garbled instruments come back.) <br /> <br />It's Not a Fashion Statement, It's a Deathwish (Plain old boring.) <br /> <br />Cemetery Drive (Nice drums at start. Vocals start nicely. A little generical in sound, but still nice.) <br /> <br />*I Never Told You What I Do For a Living (Violent lyrics, nice vocals, slowly becomes more and more panicked - nice effect.) <br /> <br />My Chemical Romance are fast becoming famous for the violent screaming style of their leadsinger, who still seems to be able to keep his screeches in pitch. Their controversial lyrics and topics can surprise and in some cases, please you. They're worth a good try, though I'm glad I managed to hear these tracks before buying the album. I'd recommend that you know what to expect before spending the money or you might be disappointed.  <br />All the same, I do like them, and hope to hear more from them in the future.
B0007O38F8|4.0|50 is back but just lacks something small! this is a good album from 50 and no one can doubt his skills as a rapper. it was always going to be difficult for 50 to live up to or even get close to his last album but he's made a decent stab at it! this is a very good album but it just lacks those chart toppers that he had before. top class beats on every song which you would expect on 50's album! <br />Those people saying that 50 is crap and this album sucks don't really have a clue about rap music. if you like 50's work on his own and with GUnit this album is another good one to have for your collection.
B0007O38F8|1.0|The cover is laughable, the song Candy Shop is the worst song ive heard in a long time. This guy raps like a fat man running a mile, it starts off good then decreases slowly. Anyone notice that besides me? I know this cd will be #1 on Billboard and every other magazine, Candy Shop is probably already a #1 song, and it'll break records but why? He can rap but just not on studio produced albums, his mixtapes are way better then Dre or Eminem produced garbage. He should dump those cute little songs and Eminem, sing the way he does on mix tapes, then ill believe he's a \\"gangster\\", but thats wont happen.
B0002CTSVS|5.0|this is one of the greatest movies ever made depicting the suffering christ endured for our sins.  A beautiful, unparalleled film that everyone should own.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Frances the Mute is probably a bigger leap an artist has ever done and I'm not here to criticize it nor criticize others who dislike it, that's their opinion and I guess people should respect it.  Although, if you are new to the band and probably were amazed by the \\"The Widow.\\" Then, here this warning The Album is not very radio friendly; there are not catchy two-minute pop songs.  With that being said, I will review the album.   <br /> <br />The first song on the album Cygnus is a slow opener and begins with a light acoustic feel to the album, reminded of Rush's The Tree's.  Then it blazes into a Latin explosion where Cedric Zavalla on vocals sings his tenor voice out of shape with Spanish words and this last about 2 to 3 minutes, then it changes from Latin to a bluesy confession and then changes back and forth.  Finally, around the six-minute timer a long strenuous guitar solo comes and it ends fading inward and outward with noises that seemed to be created from feedback and a computer recording system gone terribly wrong.  The next song is The Widow, where it is more of a blues song and seems to be in a more traditional rock outing.  The last verse and the hazy noises sounds similar to the last minutes of Cygnus, this may make people get less attracted to it, but other than that it is excellent.  Third song, which I hope I didn't misspell, is L'viala Travia.  This is sung in mostly Spanish and is accompanied by two guitar solos that will amaze you and then is strung with heavy percussion.  In the middle it gets slow and Cedric's voice turns very sensual as he speaks in English, and then the Spanish comes back and this last on for the third song. It is probably my favorite from the whole album.  Number four, is not my favorite...it stars off slow and doesn't get off to a good start until at least 4 or 5 minutes into the song, it is probably the only Mars Volta song that is slow.  From five to at least 9, I believe is a broken down Cassandra Gemini. I have heard that there are versions of the album where its put together and continues altogether, which would make it around 30 minutes long. The song itself is a genius of craftwork.  It is very fast paced and seems more like a medley of five songs than anything else.  There are string arrangements and trumpets and distorted keyboard arrangements, at this point it seems as though the lead singer has turned into a lunatic.  The Final song Frances the Mute, is more of a calm song and last around 6 minutes and is broke up like Gemini, the final song is the very first words of the first song.  It's a very interesting album and I highly recommend it. <br />
B0007N1AI6|5.0|This album puts metal back where it belongs. Its been a long time since my speakers have pounded out new priest. The wait was worth it!! I had no doubt in my mind that this album would rock. And it delivers track by track. Great to see the guys rockin' the world again! Judas has risen!
B0002OERI0|2.0|There are very high expectations to something called rock album of the year, which means it beat out hundreds, even thousands, of CD's that came out in 2004.  I decided to analyze what it was about it that deserved such an award. Here are the main reasons I've heard: <br />\\"Well you know, Green Day went political\\"...many bands have done superb political albums, especially this past year or so with the election.  Bad Religion put out an incredible anti-Bush CD this past year but didn't get much recognition.  I'll keep it short but I could list several other bands of simply punk on this topic.  So that couldn't be the real reason. <br />\\"Oh but it's a rock opera!\\"...they're basing this on because it tells a story with a recurring character.  This isn't new either, as Mars Volta, Armor for Sleep, Coheed & Cambria, and many others, do the same concept with each CD, not just one, and they get no respect.  So Green Day has simply done a mainstream rock opera, that's all.  <br />\\"Oh but they have 2 nine minute songs!\\"...Each of the parts in these songs could serve as separate songs themselves, and probably would have been better and longer, but they're collectively one song by just having the next start right after the preceding one.  This isn't new either, many bands now delve into really long songs recently. <br />\\"Oh but it's about hating Bush!\\"...upon listening to the lyrics, I can only see that it's about American society with only a few lines about government.  The only reason it's so anti-Bush is because they keep saying it is, if they didn't, we would have a harder time knowing. <br />Now that the concepts are out of the way, what about the music itself?  Green Day delivers it's bland three, and sometimes only two, chord melodic rock played over and over that they've been doing for years, utilizing tired punk riffs that have been used in many songs before. (\\"Holiday's\\" riff is the same as The Offspring's \\"All I Want\\", Anti-Flag's \\"Die For The Government\\", Bad Religion's \\"21st Century Digital Boy\\", you get the point, and \\"City of the Damned\\"s chorus is taken right from Bryan Adams's \\"Summer of '69\\")  Sure it's kinda catchy at first, but it gets old really quickly.  If you're beginning guitar playing, Green Day is a really good beginner's band. The average guitarist can figure out how to play each of these songs within their first or second listen.  The guitar solos simply mimic the vocal harmonies, giving no variety.  I could go on, you may have stopped reading by now, but I figured an album so heavily praised and awarded, and a band that is adored and makes millions of dollars, needs to be looked at very critically. <br /> <br />As for supporting the troops, what's so wrong about that?  There are many of them out there who are only fighting because of the administration's decisions, not their own (I didn't leave out the fact that not all of the troops disagree with being there).  That statement has nothing to do with disliking this CD.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|After listening to Angel of Retribution several times, I don't know what a true Priest fan would ask for after listening to this album. There are so many signature Judas Priest vocals, guitars, bass lines and lyrics that it's almost a Greatest Hits album. I mean that in the most complimentary way. <br /> <br />Worried that some of the bite would be lost after some years apart? I was, and in my opinon, the teeth are just as sharp as they were in 1984. I say that because for me, Judas Priest went on a run beginning with \\"British Steel\\" that kept rising through \\"Point of Entry,\\" \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\" and \\"Defenders of the Faith.\\" \\"Turbo\\" was okay, but obviously influenced by the pop-metal successes of Def Leppard and other 80's hair bands (Halford even grew hair). Then came an abomination of a live album called \\"priest...live!\\" Maybe it was the brown cover, the poorly drawn and pedantic hands, the lack of the classic logo, but something came crashing to a halt with that live album. For me, nothing from that choke on has been true Priest. Sorry, Ripper fans, but I respectfully disagree. <br /> <br />For me this CD falls neatly in place among \\"Screaming\\" and \\"Defenders.\\" The scream of Halford, the dual guitar attack, the ability to mix actual melody with mesmerizing riffs, all of the above-- these are the signs of Priest at its best. Today I've been listening to \\"Unleashed in the East,\\" \\"British Steel\\" and \\"Angel of Retribution\\" on rotation in my iTunes and they're all in perfect sync. <br /> <br />I don't overthink the Priest. I have never bought any Priest record with the hope that the lyrical content would entrall me. I can't believe there's people here critical of self-referential lyrics or the occasional cliche. I don't know what they thought they were hearing when \\"Point of Entry\\" or \\"Screaming\\" were released, but at the end of the day Judas Priest is about music that you want to play with the amp turned up to \\"11.\\" \\"Angel of Retribution\\" is no different.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|It hit the floor after hearing the first 30 seconds of this album! The Mars Volta has reinvented themselfs with the help of Frances The Mute. They make shifting genres so friggin simple. On De-loused, the Volta demonstrated some really spacey out there rock opuses. but on Frances they tone it down just a little and really explore different musical styles. Don't get me wrong, there are alot of spacey influences here but theres also alot of jazz, funk, and a promonent latin grove. With new insturments like a string, and horn section ( including flea, who sits in on \\"The Widow\\" and \\"Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore\\") I think these guys really found their grove on this album. Its a much easier listen then De-louced. Which is good because I know some people who werer a little scared away by it. The whole thing flows together beautifuly. I held high expectations for this album and they were actuly exceated! This is defnitly the first addition of the year to my best of 2005 list.
B0007O38F8|1.0|His name equates his value which translates into his abilities. <br />Less than 1 dollar.
B0007O38F8|5.0|Don't believe the other reviews of the cd, it is a classic. He shows off alot of skill on the massacre. It has few guest appearances, and shows off new producers that have alot of skill. The CD got 4 stars in Rolling stone, an XL out of XXL in XXL. It is a classic. The CD is filled with talent. And there are songs you can bump to, and vibe to at the same time. The other reviewers are trying to lower the score because they don't have anything else to do. Go listen to the CD before becoming a critic.
B0006PV5VC|5.0|I own different copies of this production, including the JVC XRCD. I debated about getting another copy, but trust me, get TWO. The SACD version will give you a level of enjoyment that you have never experienced before. If you don't need a backup copy, buy two anyway and resell it on eBay in a few years.
B00003OSTV|4.0|I recently purchased the video Quo Vadis and watched it twice. I enjoyed it very much. It is a good movie from the 1950's and it protrayed the sufferings of early Christians under Nero. It is too bad that Hollywood doesn't make films like this anymore.It would be nice to have this film put on DVD.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This is the first CD I've taken the time to 'review' and I'm only doing it to go against the 'one star guy'. He's just mad because he can't take this CD out and DJ with it. I'm so sure everybody will be really broken up over that missed opportunity in musical history. not. But for real, for those of you who take music seriously, this CD is a must have. This is the best CD I've heard since their last one, or Tool's 'Lateralus'. It's a mind-blowing ride that can't be expressed in words. The complexity, creativity, and sheer musical skill that it took to make is jaw-dropping. I feel really, really sorry for anyone who can't appreciate this piece of plastic in all it's infinite glory
B0007NFL18|1.0|Wow.......if you actually think 50 cent is a good rapper, then I feel sorry for you. His lyrics sucks, his voice is annoying, and the beats are WAY overproduced. The only reason why it will sell is because of Dre and Em producing the tracks, creating and publicizing him. The ONLY reason why it will sell is because of one) stupid teenie club songs and two) All the beef is talking is going to draw attention to his new albumn, WHY ELSE WOULD HE BE DISSING EVERYONE!? Including The Game..? He's so pathetic. He IS worse than Ja Rule, G Unit is tight, 50.....? Omfg. He's a joke.
B0002EXFNI|5.0|This is a great comedy!    This story, about a normal unpopulair guy on highschool, meeting the girl of his dreams is just fantastic!   But ofcourse, there's always a catch. She happens to be an adult film star... This brings him into shock, and he starts to make mistakes. Then he tries to keep her on his side, but that isn't easy, when a lot of things seem to stand between the girl next door and him.    Emile Hirsch plays his rol as the unpopulair Matthew perfectly! He knows how to act and how to look his best in his roll.   Elisha Cuthbert plays the roll of the sexy dream girl next door, and does this exelent! She knows how to steal the scences with her great acting, and that beautiful look in her eyes.  Than there is Timothy Olyphant, who plays the roll of the \\"Is he my friend or my enemy?\\" in a great way.    A great, funny comedy about sex, drama, but most of all: Falling in Love for the first time.    A must see.
B0007O38F8|5.0|50 Cent avoids the Sophomore Jinx, and brings a very Strong LP to the table. <br />The massacre has a Very Hard Core but smooth vibe to it. <br />With the tracks like \\"Get in my Car\\" and \\"Outta Control\\" he brings the laid back tracks that Even the most Outspoken 50 Cent haters got to nod their heads to the beats.. <br />Then the controversy flows with the BEEF track \\"Piggy Bank\\" Aiming at Ja Rule, Jadakiss,Shyne and Fat Joe. He literally  <br />makes you believe that he can take on so many Enemies <br />Is this a Chess Move? or will this be a something 50 Cent will regret later on in the year? <br />Only time will tell... <br />Not only is he also Beefing with NAS, but he Kicked Out The Game from his G-Unit camp for not being a True G-Unit soldier. What will Dr.Dre do to Fix this problem, when he actually has 50 CENT and GAME as label-mates of AFTERMATH records?  <br />Well it seems like 50 CENT is going to be riding a Wave of Controversy and hype from all of this so close to his album release date set for March 3rd. <br /> But Honestly THE MASSACRE is a BETTER ALBUM then GET RICH\\" <br />      so Get ready for a Spring and Summer jam packed full of 50 CENT Bravado
B0002TT0NM|1.0|I'm not sure exactly which of the series I saw, but it was definitely not for children.  <br /> <br />This may seem like a great children's STORY, which it is, but the movie has hidden messages of homosexuality.  <br /> <br />Please do not watch this.
B0007GADZO|5.0|If you are the type that cant sit back in a dark room, throw on a cd, close your eyes, and experience great music... Then dont buy this album, go buy Nickelback instead.  This record adds to steve's already odd collection of music.  His pure genious is subtle throughout the record.  If you listen carefully you can hear many subtle nuances in  how the record progresses...  Listen to it all at once or not at all.  Good work Steve.  Oh and sometimes it has a shade of John Petrucci, which i assume is tribute (see track 9, Midway Creatures)
B000002UAF|5.0|Although the early Beatles' music was considered 'bubblegum pop' and simplistic and unsophisticated compared to the later classics, 'A Hard Day's Night' possibly contains the Beatle's catchiest songs. While the later songs are more experimental and musically sophisticated, the early songs made you want to get up and sing and dance. In my opinion possibly their best album tied with Abbey Road and Revolver.  <br /> <br />'And I Love' her and 'I Should Have Known Better' and 'A Hard Day's Night' are the best tracks. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002X314C|5.0|I'll keep it simple. This album pretty much guarantees that John Legend will be a soul legend on his time and by his method. So if you're looking for great soul food, then check out this album. One serving won't be enough.
B000286S8S|4.0|OK, I've recently been checking out the boys of Van Halen again. I liked some of their songs when I was little, but never really got into them. Well, I am now, and I have the most popular Roth-era albums (Van Halen, 1984). So, I decided to check this compliation for songs from mostly Hagar & some Roth that I've never heard, that way, I won't forget to download all the songs on here, lol. Anyway, like the great amazon reviewer Der Kommissar, I'm going to do the Pros & Cons thing this time.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />-YOU'VE GOT ALMOST ALL OF THE HITS HERE ON 2 DISCS, EXCELLENT FOR A CASUAL FAN. You got all the classics like \\"Jump\\", \\"You Really Got Me\\", \\"Runnin' With the Devil\\", \\"(Oh) Pretty Woman\\", \\"Panama\\", \\"Why Can't This Be Love?\\", \\"Can't Stop Lovin' You\\", \\"Unchained\\", \\"Beautiful Girls\\" & \\"Right Now\\".<br />-3 NEW TRACKS WITH SAMMY HAGAR, AND THEY'RE PRETTY AWESOME NEW CATALOG ADDITIONS. \\"It's About Time\\" (which was the single), \\"Up For Breakfast\\" & \\"Learning to See\\". These are pretty much heavier than anything they've done with Hagar. Eddie can still solo. Yeah. So hardcore fans of either era might wanna buy this set just for these songs.<br />-A LOT OF SONGS FROM FOR UNLAWFUL CARNAL KNOWLEDGE THAT WERE UNDERRATED AND NOT REALLY HITS. This was pretty cool, with songs like \\"Poundcake\\" and \\"Runaround\\".<br />-ERUPTION IS HERE, WHICH IS PROBABLY THE GREATEST INSTRUMENTAL OF ALL TIME. Seriously, Eddie made one of the REAL most influential guitar solos of all time on this one. It is forbidden not to put this on any VH compliation.<br />-NO SONGS FROM VAN HALEN III (where Gary Cherone from Extreme was the vocalist at the time), CAUSE IT MUST SUCK! Without You was a really big hit and maybe could've been on here since it's the only praised song on the album, but who cares?!<br />-THERE'S 3 LIVE SONGS FROM THE RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW ALBUM!! That's very excellent. Hagar's redentions of those 3 classic DLR songs rock just as hard as DLR, but not by much!<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />-ONLY ONE SONG FROM FAIR WARNING?!! This is what angers me the most. Fair Warning is a highly praised album by fans, yet they had the NERVE to only put Unchained on it?? Geez!<br />-WHERE ARE MEAN STREET AND ICE CREAM MAN?! WTF?? Those were some of VH's most popular & top fan favorite songs! They could've replaced one of the Live songs & Black And Blue with those, otherwise it could've been a 5 star compliation<br />-LIKE ON BEST OF VOL. 1, ERUPTION DOESN'T LEAD INTO YOU REALLY GOT ME. Not THAT big of a problem, but it could've been done this time.<br />-FINISH WHAT YA STARTED'S ENDING IS CUT OUT. That's some bad news too, since the ending was pretty awesome.<br /><br />Well, that ends it there. \m/ VH! Best of Both Worlds, y'all! Defenitaly buy this if you're a casual fan, it has pretty much all the songs you know and love on the radio!s what angers me the most. Fair Warning is a highly praised album by fans, yet they had the NERVE to only put Unchained on it?? Geez!  -WHERE ARE MEAN STREET AND ICE CREAM MAN?! WTF??

B0007O38F8|3.0|yeah, u gotta give 50 his props, this album is pretty good, but no match to get rich or die tryin. i think 50 has gotta stop tryin to start stuff wit people and rap about whats reallll....
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Wow...For once, Im seriously at a loss of words. Can somebody please explain to me WHAT is so special about this movie? After all of the morons in my grade raved about it, and all of my friends encouraging me to watch it, I decided to finally sit down and watch it...and I seriously think it lowered my IQ. Napoleon's character is outwardly dumb and awkward, and its funny! For the first 15 minutes. After that I just felt like throwing something at my TV for the whole movie. There is NO plot here whatsoever. Napoleon tries to get together with another outwardly dumb and awkward girl, while his outwardly dumb and awkward friend runs for class president. To appreciate this movie you would have to be completely brain dead.
0684808323|4.0|Note this book is not fiction, nor a novelization of the film Casino.  Like Wiseguy, it's the real account that Scorsese fashioned into a film (with Pileggi's help again).<br /><br />Casino tells the story of the Chicago mob's major role in running Las Vegas, how it happened, and how it more or less ended (or appeared to) in the 1980s.  Instead, corporations (institutionalized gangsters) took over, and now we're to assume that gambling is a respectable, fine industry.  It's hard to cheer for the state 'gaming' officials as they pursue mobsters who are skimming a casino, of all places.  A character in the film says it best when he exclaims, 'You mean the money we're robbing is bein' robbed?!'<br /><br />A good read before or after the excellent film.  Readers will note that the basis for the Frank Vincent character (Frank Marino in the film, Frank Cullotta in real life) provides much of the info here, certainly on Tony 'the Ant' Spillotro, the basis for the Pesci character.  There's quite a bit of detail as far shady business dealings, politics, and mob bosses go, but less of the nitty gritty mobster detail from Wiseguy.<br /><br />Hard to know whether to weep for the old or new Las Vegas.  While it was mobbed-up in the past, it's now a neutralized Disneyworld and a respectable holiday destination for families.

I thought that would be cool, but now it's all just gone silly. I used to enjoy this, but I've come to the conclusion that Chucky movies NEED to be horror in order to be good, but....it's changed over the past few years.
0316172324|4.0|Most of us have experienced a split second of \\"knowingness\\" when confronted by a particular individual or circumstance - the heart pounds faster, the hands become clammy; \\"something\\" tells us to steer clear of this person or situation, only to discover later that our instincts were absolutely right. I cannot count the numerous occasions this has occurred over the years. This instinct we all possess is hard wired in our brains, fined tuned over millions of years of evolution. Of course this is nothing new. We have always been told to \\"trust\\" this inner voice, to run with it, that it is, more often than not, the right call. However, this is not always the case. As Gladwell points out in \\"Blink\\", our unconscious minds can be influenced by implicit cultural conditions, and this \\"instinct\\" can be terribly wrong, leading in some extreme cases, to total disaster.<br /><br />Gladwell's message is that these implicit feelings, these instinctive signs, is one of the more powerful skills we posses. He suggests that our so-called \\"snap-judgement\\" based on \\"thin slicing\\", that is computing minimal but important observations from the environment, can be fined tuned. Unfortunately, he does not explain exactly how this \\"fine-tuning\\" can be effectively done. If we are all simply products of our environment, conditioned from an early age to believe and see the world in a certain way, how is it possible to \\"un-learn\\" the false data we've accumulated over a lifetime, to ensure our \\"snap-judgements\\" are the right ones?<br /><br />As Gladwell does in his best selling book, The Tipping Point, he supplies the reader with a plethora of examples and tests to substantiate his arguments. The most interesting example was the gentleman who could \\"read minds\\" solely based on interpreting facial expressions. In the studies of Paul Ekman and Wallace Freisen, they focus on the literally thousands of facial expressions we learn from infancy, and how a vast majority of our expressions are involuntary, revealing our true and innermost thoughts. Gladwell suggests that all of us, at least unconsciously, can read these expressions, which aid us in interpreting and contextualizing our environment.<br /><br />\\"Blink\\" is an interesting discussion on our instincts, proposing that operating on less information and following our \\"guts\\" is usually the wiser path. Gladwell's conclusion, however, is an age-old one, and that is attaining a balance between body, mind and spirit. The ancient Greeks gave this same advice over three thousand years ago. It is good advice, but similar to anything apparently simple, it is easier said than done.tary, revealing our true and innermost thoughts.

0316666343|3.0|I really don't understand the popularity of this book.  I am about 4/5ths of the way through it and I don't know if I can make myself finish it.<br /><br />Let me start with everything that I liked about the book.  The author is clearly brilliant and literary.  I loved her writing style, her way with words, and her command of the English language.  Her characterizations were excellent and quite descriptive.  And I liked the concept.  So why does it feel as though I'm studying for a physics exam while I'm plowing through the end of this book?<br /><br />Many parts of the book are just plain old boring.  The story could easily have been condensed into a much shorter novel.  I also find Susie's affect to be really strange and not credible.  Some other posters here have described her as being wistful at times or matter-of-fact.  To me, she seemed to have no affect at all until more than halfway through the book.<br /><br />I have just reached certain scenes which seem highly implausible and I am tired of reading the book.  I belong to a book club and have been forcing myself for months to read one book after another that I have not liked.  A part of me is rebelling against that now and shouting, \\"Why finish it if you don't have to?\\"<br /><br />Well, being the type A personality that I am, I will probably finish it :-) And I do want to know what happens in the end, but this will not be a book that I will recommend to other people to read.  That's sad because the author is immensely talented and was brave enough to take on two very serious subjects -- murder and the afterlife. If only she had made her dialogue sharper, added more depth, cut the book by at least 50 --100 pages, I might have really enjoyed this book.<br /><br />Sigrid Mac
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Surely there's nothing new that I can add to this ongoing debate among the fans, but let me place myself amongst the 'thumbs up' camp. This album is great exactly because it departs from DTs ever evolving sound. TOT doesn't sound like SDOIT which doesn't sound like SFAM which doesn't sound like FII which doesn't sound like I&W etc. Dream Theater overall is known for having a more 'positive' metal sound, but I'm delighted to hear them being angry and dark and cynical and all that great stuff. To those who fear they are losing their prog-ness and sounding like the mainstream, let a fellow prog-lover disagree and say that just because a band sounds more accessable doesn't mean they are losing their prog-metal roots. I'm just relived that I have an album that I won't be embarassed to play in front of my non-prog friends. Even still, DT hasn't lost any of their prog-metal edge (the outrageous solos and compositions are still there in spades), they have just gained the respect of those from other genres. <br />Buy this album. I'm glad I did.
B0002X314C|5.0|There is finally someone willing to step up and help fill the R&B void that has only been half filled by Alicia Keys. Thank you John Legend. Anyone who thinks that this is \\"wanna-be gangsta?\\" music has to be completely out of their mind. This is R&B. This album is genius. John Legend goes beyond anything his peers have done. He stands alone as one of the true R&B creators of his time. His music is like magic and his voice is bold and elegant. Some of these people writing reviews either don't want to hear good music, or just don't want John Legend to be successful.

B0002KVUKW|1.0|We went to see this in the theatre. We saw the previews and were very excited to see it. We wound up laughing the whole way through the movie...<br /><br />I will say this, it was ambitiously bad. It was as if they let a couple of very excited and imaginative 12 year old boys write the script. The characters were cartoonish and over the top the plot was ridiculous. The CGI was overused ( you can literally not go 5 minutes in this movie without seeing CGI ) and the most intense scene in the movie was when Hugh Jackman's crotch get too close to a wagon wheel...Will his crotch survive? Buy the movie and see.<br /><br />And a few minor aspects of irritation...<br /><br />The vampire was so wimpy that the singer for The Cure could kick his butt, he was like a melodramatic goth kid.<br /><br />The lead actress's hair, costume and make-up remain spotlessly perfect throughout the movie.<br /><br />And there was enough rope swinging that I was begining to think it was a tarzan movie. I swear if I never see another perfectly molded butt swinging from a rope, it will still be too soon.<br /><br />Don't watch this movie, unless you are into doing the home version of Mystery Science Theatre.

B0002YCVXI|1.0|This is the WORST Yo Yo Ma album I have EVER heard....good god....look, if you want to really hear Morricone at his best, buy the soundtrack to the movie \\"The Mission\\". If you do not own that  soundtrack, then you have no business pretending you are getting Grade A Morricone by purchashing this totally rancid CD.  This celebrity collaboration fails at every level and is the most boring, wandering CD I have ever heard with only the first cut being only briefly half way OK.  This is so beneath the talent of both these accomplished artists that it is a wonder how it EVER got produced.....all these glowing 5 start tributes mean ZIP.....don't buy it.  Stay very far away from this album if you have any wits about you.  Just because somebody put two big names together and slapped out an album doesn't mean it is by definition going to be good.  This is a total failure.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napoleon Dynamite demonstrated to me such an ordinary story that is so unusual to see in movies today.  Every character in this film reminded me of someone I knew in high school.  This is what made it so funny to me, the fact that it was like seeing all these people I used to know again.  Napoleon as a character was so complex and masterfully played, I really don't think they could have gotten a better actor for that part.  With all the good things I have said about this film, I don't reccommend it to everyone.  For those who don't really like the \\"Seinfeld\\" no point in the story script, it's not for you, but if you're just looking for something simple it's a great movie.
1400031087|4.0|James Frey's eye opening book, A Million Little Pieces, digs deep beneath the surface as to what it is like to be in a rehabilitation center dealing with horrible obsessions. Based on a real experience the book begins with James not knowing where he is with the droning of an airplane in his ear. Here readers and Frey begin the fast moving roller coaster of events and emotions. It is a moving story with many characters that come and go with each page. The entire book grasps the topic and ignites it with truth, reality and pain. Readers will venture through his highs and lows each revolving around the fact that James is a crack addict, alcoholic and wanted in three states.  <br />I found the book to be very descriptive and at times hard to read. Since James is a recovering addict so when he is going through withdraws it is sometimes difficult to read the description.  Even though some parts were highly detailed the book was still so engaging. I have never read a book that ventured into a topic that was so realistic and I have benefited from his story in many ways. I have not encountered a book besides this in which the story urges me to never become what this character has, or a story that has informed me about the harsh reality of being addicted to drugs.   <br />
B0007GAEW6|3.0|Frances The Mute is a mixed bag to end all mixed bags. Upon first listen I was blown away, repulsed, excited, and bored, and that was just from the first song. The musicianship is stellar, except in the case of Omar. Jon's drumming is still mindblowingly amazing, and newcomer Juan follows every nook and cranny with perfect precision. Cedric's vocals have greatly improved, but possibly at the loss of true sincerity and emotion. Ikey's contribution, like on Deloused In The Comatorium, is still pushed back to make room for unintelligable guitar wankery from Omar, this and every Mars Volta album's weak link. True, Omar writes most of the music, and you think that'd be enough for him, but his dissonnant noodling ruins what could be some great moments. The hushed emotion in the soft instrumental break in cygnus... vismund cygnus is torched in favor of some jangly guitar masturbation. He sometimes takes a step back and helps propel the other melodies and rhythms to greater heights, and these are the moments that make Frances The Mute worth listening to. There are some cringe-worthy moments, such as the entirety of the discernably label influenced power ballad The Widow, or the embarrassingly out of place face melter that starts L'Via (thanks Frusciante). All told, the one reason i suggest people listen to this album is the 30 minute centerpiece, Cassandra Gemini. The song twists and turns, snaking from bad-ass riff to bad-ass riff, cedric's scathing vocals stabbing relentlessly throughout while flutes and saxaphones flutter overhead. The other golden moment is Miranda, That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore. It may take drugs to enjoy the 5 minutes of ambience that precedes it, but once you get through that the album hits it's emotional peak, helped by Flea's humble trumpeteering. Ignore all the hype and fanfare and have a listen. If it isn't really your thing i suggest trying the Tremulant EP to hear the band on it's first shaky (but amazing) legs. The Mars Volta may not be subtle, they may not be humble, they may be grossly overrated, but they are worth at least one half-hearted listen.
B000002PCS|5.0|I remember seeing this film when I was a kid. I wasn't into the movie, but the music that played in the background kept me watching. Imagine, a kid watching a drama! Who'd a thunkit! <br /> <br />Anyway, this soundtrack contains two of the most beautiful classical pieces I've ever heard. Rhapsody on a theme of paganini is my all time favorite song. The second is the movies main theme. Although not really classical, it feels like it. Maybe neo-classical is a better description. <br /> <br />Even if you aren't a fan of the film, which I can't understand, you will love this soundtrack. Don't believe me? Listen to the samples for yourself and you'll see. This is one I can listen to over and over.
0446310786|5.0|This book tries to do so much, and actually succeeds.  It combines mystery with morality and intrigue.  You cannot read this book and not be touched deeply by it.<br /><br />The basic story is seen through the eyes of a child.

B0007GAEW6|5.0|Step 1: Throw out anything you have ever heard about THE MARS VOLTA... <br />Step 2: Run out RIGHT NOW and buy Frances the Mute, it's only $6.99 at target and best buy for the most evolved and sophistocated albums ever made. <br />Step 3: Listen to it all the way through with an open mind, and my god savor it because you will always remember this first listen. <br /> <br />That is the only review that should be required, but if 7 dollars is a pricey gamble for you consider this:  The Mars Volta has completely redifined EPIC MEANINGFUL jams, creating an album that is almost a musical guilty pleasure because of it's pure lust for music in general.  If you are like me and love music, and live for listening to new cd's and expanding your creative horizon then buy this cd-end of story.  If you are close minded and are ready to break free from standard music this album will be your messiah.   <br /> <br />FRANCES IS TRULY THE MOST EPIC DISPLAY OF MUSICAL POWER <br /> <br />(if you have lisened to the whole cd and dissagree... seriosly tell me right now so I can experience what I have missed)  <br /> <br />The point is to accept that this album is overflowing with originality, and power,and variety even if it's not your taste you MUST appreciate/respect it.  To anyone complaning about the song length, or the depth of the album, or the cryptic lyrics seriosly don't waste your time critiquing an album of this intellecual level...and go ahead and join the majority of people that are so afraid of variety and experience they slave away and listen to the same 3 minute verse/chorus/verse/CHORUS CHORUS CHORUS filler that is just asking for your money(not your mind).....maybe at some point you will either grow up mentally or evolve existentially and realize there is the music that comes and goes and makes you feel good(and god love it, pop music is vital) but there is also mind bending revolutionary music that is what music is supposed to be: <br />ART ART ART ART ART ART ART ART ART ART ART ART ART ART ART ART

The emotion, both positive and negative, absolutly pours out of this masterpiece.  This album in my opinion is the true middle of the road for the group.  This Album blends the old-school sound and the more modern version of the benchmark group of American rock music.
B00005JNDZ|1.0|I disagree with a previous reviewer: I found the \\"Edge of Reason\\" book much more palatable than the film. <br /> <br />There simply aren't enough hours in life to waste even a part of one delineating in detail the reasons I was disappointed by this film after reading the book.  Besides, most other reviewers have touched on them: the way Renee was shot SO unflatteringly; great liberties with the storyline and characters; cramming the story into too short of a running time.  Enough said. <br /> <br />Granted, this review is of the film, not the DVD iteself. But I doubt that any additional features would sufficiently overcome the movie's weaknesses to motivate me to spend money on the DVD.

All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! <br />The setting, the dialogues, the special effects, the music and the costumes are all wonderful! <br />In short, it is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  Strongly recommended along with Judge Dredd. <br />
B0000025H6|5.0|Actually if I were going to go beyond the idea of a concept album with \\"The Wall\\" I would be more inclined to call it an oratorio, similar to Jethro Tull's \\"Thick as a Brick\\" or \\"Passion Play,\\" rather than a rock opera like \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\" or the Who's \\"Tommy.\\"  That is because the over riding unity of the songs in \\"The Wall\\" is thematic rather than narrative in nature.  The bleak double album is Roger Waters' meditation on the walls human beings build up to ensure their survival in the post-modern world.  It is also something of a departure from the group's previous albums, most notably \\"The Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" it that the group's signature cosmic rock sound is giving way to some more traditional pop music sensibilities.  The compelling electronics and other special effects that had become key components of Pink Floyd's music, and which put \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" on the chart for literally years, now takes a back seat to the themes and lyrics (although there are still some choice moments, such as when Gomer Pyle shows up on \\"Nobody Home\\").<br /><br />The \\"story,\\" such as it is, concerns a rock star named Pink (no subtlety here, boys and girls), who is disgusted with the lesser human being he has become as a result of his celebrity.  The key song in the album is \\"Comfortably Numb\\" (co-written by lead guitarist Dave Gilmour), which is one of the classic rock songs about alienation, although obviously the title begs to have it labeled a song about intoxication by the drug on your choice.  But the context for lyrics such as \\"You are only coming through in waves/Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying\\" is clearly about the despair of being disconnected from humanity.  It is also a lament about the lose of childhood, which remains in Waters' vision the time when we are at our best as human beings:<br /><br />When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse<br /><br />Out of the corner of my eye<br /><br />I turned to look but it was gone<br /><br />I cannot put my finger on it now<br /><br />The child is grown, the dream is gone<br /><br />I have become comfortably numb<br /><br />The music for \\"Comfortably Numb\\" is both operatic and eerie, a paradox that is nonetheless accurate.  The relentlessly depressing picture of a rock star's life would have you worrying about the mental health of Roger Waters if it were not for the suspicion he is writing as much about the life in general and former Pink Floyd lead guitarist and main songwriter Syd Barrett as it is an attempt at catharsis by Waters after spitting on a fan during a concert for daring to applaud during an acoustic number.  I always was struck by the start of \\"Mother,\\" with one of the very best examples of a caesura with the extremely effective pause between the first line, \\"Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb?\\" and the second, \\"Mother, do you think they'll like this song?\\"  There is a world of meaning in the vocal silence there that I have never forgotten.<br /><br />There are two pitfalls to \\"The Wall.\\"  The first is that Pink Floyd released a rare single with \\"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2,\\" which mean that school children rebelling against the system now had something to sing throughout the year while waiting for the end of the year to do Alice Cooper's \\"Schools Out.\\"  Consequently, in the popular consciousness \\"The Wall\\" was boiled down to the following potent lyrics:<br /><br />We don't need no education<br /><br />We don't need no thought control<br /><br />No dark sarcasm in the classroom<br /><br />Teachers leave them kids alone<br /><br />Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone!<br /><br />All in all it's just another brick in the wall.<br /><br />All in all you're just another brick in the wall.<br /><br />Yet taken in its totality it can hardly be said that the primary purpose of this double-album was an attack on the educational system in England.  In song after song the \\"character\\" is blaming others for histroubles, so it is not surprising that teachers end up on that list.  But the success of the single made it seem this was what the whole thing was all about.  For that matter, there are more songs concerned with the threat of nuclear destruction (\\"Mother,\\" \\"Goodbye Blue Skies\\") than education.  By the time you through Waters' paranoia over Great Britain becoming fascist (\\"Run Like Hell\\") the whole indictment of education seems like just another, well, you know what (which would be the point, right?).<br /><br />The second concern is that the disparity between the highs and lows on this album are rather substantial.  It is rather like sitting through an opera and some of recitatives (e.g., \\"Goodbye Cruel World\\") to get to the arias (e.g., \\"Hey You\\").  The best tracks on this album are as pretty good, but you still have to sit through some less than stellar sections (e.g., \\"One of My Turns\\").  The loose narrative is not enough to help us connect the dots and I suspect it is only by really getting totally into the album and trying to achieve consubstantiality with the creative vision of Roger Waters that you can really make sense of it all.  This is why the production values of \\"The Wall\\" as performed by Pink Floyd in concert tended to replace the psychological dimensions of listening to it in the dark in your room.<br /><br />The key thing here is that there are moments in \\"The Wall\\" that match its ambition.  The sum is greater than the total of the parts, but there is certainly nothing wrong with that being the case.teachers end up on that list.

1417618086|5.0|Greed, gold-digging and deception sit at the heart of \\"Vanity Fair.\\" It's no joke that it's subtitled \\"a novel without a hero\\" -- William Makepeace Thackeray mercilessly skewered the pretentions and flaws of the upper class all throughout it. The result is a gloriously witty social satire.<br /><br />It opens with two young women departing from a ladies' academy: dull, sweet Amelia (rich) and fiery sharp-witted Rebecca (poor). Becky Sharp is a relentless social climber, and her first effort to rise \\"above her station\\" is by trying to get Amelia's brother to marry her -- an effort thwarted by Amelia's fiancee. So instead she gets married to another family's second son, Rawdon Crawley.<br /><br />Unfortunately, both young couples quickly get disinherited and George is killed. But Becky is determined to live the good life she has worked and married for -- she obtains jewels and money from admiring gentlemen, disrupting her marriage. But a little thing like a tarnished reputation isn't enough to keep Becky down...<br /><br />\\"Vanity Fair\\" is actually a lot more complex than that, with dozens of little subplots and complicated character relationships. Reading it a few times is necessary to really absorb all of it, since it is not just a look at the two women in the middle of the book, but at the upper (and sometimes lower) social strata of the nineteenth century.<br /><br />The main flaw of the book is perhaps that it sprawls too much -- there's always a lot of stuff going on, not to mention a huge cast of characters, and Thackeray sometimes drops the ball when it comes to the supporting characters and their little plots. It takes a lot of patience to absorb all of this. However... it's worth it.<br /><br />Like most nineteenth-century writers, Thackeray had a very dense, formal writing style -- but once you get used to it, his writing becomes insanely funny. Witticisms and quips litter the pages, even if you don't pick them all up at once. At first Thackeray seems incredibly cynical (Becky's little schemes almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.<br /><br />Becky Sharp is the quintessential anti-heroine -- she's very greedy and cold, yet she's also so smart and determined that it's hard not to have a grudging liking for her. Certainly life hasn't been fair for her. Next to Becky, a goody-goody character like Amelia is pretty boring, and even the unsubtle George can't measure up to Becky.<br /><br />To sum up \\"Vanity Fair\\": think a period soap opera with a heavy dose of social commentary. In other words, it doesn't get much better than this, Thackeray's masterpiece..

B0001LJC2K|4.0|Apparently the third time was the charm -- little-known Brit-rock band Muse's third album was the one to break out in the US. \\"Absolution\\" is definitely a dark little gem -- the songs focus on deterioration and lost love, set against classical-sounding rock.<br /><br />\\"And pull us through/And this is the end/This is the end of the world.\\" An ominous piano crashes into \\"Apocalypse,\\" which is only one of several songs with a deathly edge, such as the epic \\"Time is Running Out\\" or the soaring \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\" (\\"Fights and battles have begun/Revenge will surely come/Your hard times are ahead...\\"). Even the most intimate song is the thoughts of a dying atheist, afraid of what is -- and isn't -- after death.<br /><br />But Muse is also focusing on love. Dead loves, lost loves, and the idea of loves that can't or won't last out. The delicate, bittersweet \\"Sing for Absolution\\" is perhaps the purest example of this -- a love song for a woman who is apparently dead. Other songs focus on the mix of love and hate, and the feeling of love crumbling away.<br /><br />That focus of death and love -- or both together -- is what makes \\"Absolution\\" so compelling. Muse is often written off as a Radiohead clone, but their sound is more complex, and their focus is darker. A riff here and there echoes of Radiohead, and Matt Bellamy's voice echoes that of Thom Yorke. But that's about all.<br /><br />There's nothing spacey or eerie about Muse's brand of rock. Instead, they opt for a soaring, rich sound, with orchestral melodies. It's obvious that Bellamy has studied not just rock, but classical as well -- he integrates the epic quality of classical music into a melody written for guitar, bass, piano and drums. At times the sound is so massive -- not loud, but massive -- that it sounds like the speakers are going to explode.<br /><br />With music like that, one would think that Bellamy's voice would get lost in the mix. Surprisingly he doesn't -- he's no Jose Carreras, but his voice has gained new maturity, able to be a standard rock voice one moment, and then a pure choral vocalist the next. He brings across the heartbreak and anguish in the songs with startling purity, as if he means every word.<br /><br />In fact, those songs are the one weak spot -- they aren't as big or as rich as the music, which makes them sound a bit tepid. They're not bad. But they simply don't measure up to the musical genius. So ignore the words, and just listen to Bellamy and the music.<br /><br />The orchestral wall-of-sound has been Muse's trademark, and they are in fine form in their third album. Beautiful, rich and heartbreaking, this is one to keep.e Carreras, but his voice has gained new maturity, able to be a standard rock voice one moment, and then a pure choral vocalist the next.

B0007O38F8|5.0|I listened to Get Rich Or Die Tryin and I honestly dont know what everyone was busting over the cd wasnt that hott I thought it was average at best again just my opinion. When I listened to the Massacre I was blown away the cd is unreal the beats are hott and his flows aint bad either I mean if there is 1 track I found weak on the cd it would be track #10 but again it is still a good track its just weaker than the rest. This cd is above average hell its all ive been doing is bumping this cd I didnt really know what to expect when I was buying this cd because I heard the 2050 mixtape and I thought it sucked im like wow this cd is going to suck if half of these songs are on there but I was suprised and that track with Jamie Foxx is tight. Again 50 stepped up his game and Ja Rules cd was tight but it aint like this not even remotley close this cd is phenomenal from track 1 to track 22. Plus on top of that which i was very suprised no skits on this album just song after song after song thats another plus to this album. And the whole thing with fat joe he aint even on 50's level he sucks go back to singing whats luv with ashanti cuz that is the gayest response I heard to piggy bank in my entire life hell hes breathin hard at the end of the damn song he is FAT. Well I hope this review helps go buy it its a good cd its gangsta and you will not be disappointed I promise.
0679746048|4.0|I know I really like a book when I find myself always thinking about it. I was drawn to Girl Interrupted and whatever room I left it in.<br /><br />From her unique perspective, Susanna Kaysen raises the question; how does society identify the insane. Are those who choose to live outside of accepted behavioral norms insane or do they become more vulnerable because of the resulting social isolation?<br /><br />If you, or someone you know suffers from a mental illness I highly recommend this book as an insight.  25 years after Susanna had been discharged, she researched her 'diagnosis' from the DSM III.  Being told she suffered from Borderline Personality Disorder she began to wonder how many other so called disorders have been removed from this new edition and will her disorder still exist 25 years later?  At one time, homosexuality was listed in the DSM as a psychiatriac disorder.  You won't find it in there now.  Makes you wonder what will be taken out next.
B000002U82|5.0|When people think of The Dark Side of the Moon, it brings up a strange kind of feeling.  It has a surreal feeling about it.  It has sold more than any other album.  Either you love it or you hate it.  I love it as shown by the 5 star review.  You have to listen to it as an album, but some of the songs are classics.  In fact, they pretty much all are except Great Gig in the Sky, which I can't stand, with that horrible backup opera singer.  I'd have to say my favorite song on the album is the incredibly underrated Time.  Speak to Me/ Breathe is a great opener, and Eclipse is a PERFECT end.  However, if you don't count The Great Gig in the Sky, every song would get a 10/10 from me.  Gilmour sings his best and has some great guitar, my favorite solo is in Time.
B00000FCBC|4.0|I love it when people visit their past, or intertwine it into their older present self.  This album is great to listen to when you're in the mood for Metallica, but a different sort.  This music harkens back to ye olde days.<br /><br />By far the best songs are the beginning of \\"Turn the Page\\" (it gets old after awhile), \\"Die Die My Darling,\\" and \\"Whiskey in the Jar.\\"  I wish Metallica would cover more traditional/folk songs like this, actually, they are *really* catchy and fun to sing with!<br /><br />The last mention goes to *Astronomy*.  I think this song was written for Metallica.  This is one of my favorite Metallica songs, period.  I never thought metal could be celestial like this.<br /><br />A cool secret jam takes place after the last track on Disc I.  They're just having a good time here, obviously.  But I wonder if it's original material?  It's not a song...just them playing a bit.<br /><br />As for Disc II...well, any old fan knows how great the vintage garage is...doesn't need sweepin', doesn't need touchin'.  Four awful tracks from the Motorheadache were added, and I never listen to these.<br /><br />Metallica is a band that doesn't take themselves too seriously.  They are hilarious with their antics and this album was a great way for them to show off their lighter side.  In the booklet you'll find a *wonderful* picture of \\"The Metallicats\\" where they're all dressed up in white-top tuxes like a barbershop quartet.  Hammett's expression is priceless.  One of the more fun things is a list of popular album titles with the word \\"Garage\\" replacing parts of the original title: Garagenous Zone, Give 'Em Garage, etc...don't want to ruin it all!  I can think of only a very few number of bands that entertain the listener in so many ways.<br /><br />All in all a great album that I think should show bands how a cover album should be made!
B0007O38F8|4.0|I'm not sure why some are so unsure of this album.  Its not better maybe then the first per superstar single, but how many second albums are like that?  Maybe the new factor is gone or people had their hopes way to high.  Either way I found it overall to be a better album, while not as many home runs maybe?  Only second listen also hehehe ;)
B0006399FS|2.0|I want to know what these imposters have done with the real U2. Have they been kidnapped and replaced by no-talent, mindless shape-shifting alien beings? or have they just lost their touch? Whatever it is, I hope their next album can dismantle this atomic bomb.
B0006GAI6Y|4.0|\\"Shall We Dance\\" begins with a close focus on Richard Gere a successful yuppie lawyer specializing in wills who commutes to and from his comfortable suburban Chicago home on the El.  Despite his economic success, accented by the success his wife Susan Sarandon has achieved as head of the dress buyers' department at Saks Fifth Avenue, he has a tired and discontented look, suffering from ennui.  His marriage suffers from the fact that he and Sarandon see so little of each other since their activities take care of many of their evenings as well, times they could spend together. <br /> <br />Gere's world begins to gradually change when he looks up from his commuter's perch on the El and observes a neon sign revealing Mitzi's Ballroom Dancing School.  What catches his attention is the beautiful image of Jennifer Lopez standing in the window of the second floor dance school wearing the same sad and forlorn expression he exhibits. <br /> <br />Finally Gere works up the nerve to climb the stairs and go inside.  He is assisted unwittingly by aggressive blonde Lisa Ann Walter, who initially asks him when she sees him standing in the stairway and blocking her entrance what he intends to do.  She allows him to carry her dancing togs and he enters with her.  While Mitzi, played by Anita Gillette, runs the studio, and provides the first lesson, Gere is clearly smitten with Lopez.  His distraction is evident when he begins his lesson by falling on his posterior. <br /> <br />After the session he joins the other ballroom beginning students for a bite to eat at a nearby restaurant.  His curiosity toward Lopez is increased when he hears from Walter, who provides the female comedy touch for the film as an aggressively outspoken Sadie Hawkins type, that the beautiful Hispanic dancer has joined Mitzi's struggling studio since she is in a blue funk and feeling let down since losing an opportunity to win first place at the annual international ballroom dancing competition in Blackpool, England.  Walter further saucily notes that Lopez had a falling out with her partner, with whom she allegedly shared a joint interest in more than dancing. <br /> <br />When Anita Gillette is unable to make it to class one night Lopez takes over and Gere leaves with her at the same time.  He summons up his courage and asks her to dinner.  He receives a stiff rebuff.  She tells him with stiff formality that she does not socialize with students.  After they have said their goodbyes and begin walking in opposite directions she stops him to deliver a stinging additional comment, informing him that if he joined the class in hopes of getting acquainted with her that he had better for his own sake quit immediately. <br /> <br />Gere is obviously deflated by Lopez's cutting and candid comment, but, as he tells her at a later point in the film, he did not feel he could quit at that point, since doing so would be a tacit admission that he had joined the class to pursue her.  He continues attending and the activity begins to improve his well being, so much so that his 14-year-old daughter tells Sarandon that her father is feeling happier.  She begins suspecting that he is having an affair and puts a private detective on his tail. <br /> <br />Eventually Anita Gillette is so enthused about the progress Gere is making that she coaxes him to team up with Lisa Walter in the Chicago ballroom dancing annual competition.  He has a penchant for the slower, romantic dances such as the waltz while his friend from work that he finds also taking classes at the school, played by Stanley Tucci, who supplies the male comedic touches, excels in the fast action and becomes Walter's partner in that competition. <br /> <br />Lopez provides a nervous Gere with one memorable hour of extra training.  They bond as friends and she tells him that she and her partner over trained for the Blackpool competition.  The result was that her exhausted partner collapsed at a climactic point and they failed to win or take home a trophy.  In their disappointment they also split up, with a saddened Lopez taking a job with Gillette at her school. <br /> <br />Clued in by the private detective she hired, Sarandon learns about the competition and attends with her 14-year-old daughter.  The detective tandem also attends.  While Walter falls at a strategic point and her dress is accidentally torn, preventing them from winning any honors, Gere learns that there are other ways of winning.  The ballroom activity increases his entire life perspective, as well as that of Sarandon, who anxiously seeks out his help to teach her ballroom dance technique. <br /> <br />Audrey Wells kept the action at a brisk level in her script while director Peter Chelsom could empathize with the subject matter, having been born and raised in Blackpool, the international capital of competitive ballroom dancing.  A former Royal Shakespeare Company actor, Chelsom received his big break in 1985 by portraying a young London playwright catering to the whims of temperamental leading lady Susannah York in his first production in \\"Star Quality,\\" based on a Noel Coward play.  <br />  <br />
B0007N1AI6|3.0|I don't get it.  After reading the glowing five-star reviews calling this album JP's best since Painkiller (it's not), or worse, thinking it's their first album SINCE Painkiller, I seriously wonder if anyone actually listened to Demolition or Jugulator.  People are acting as if Judas Priest hasn't existed for the past ten years.  Um, hello? <br /> <br />A lot of people seem to be clamoring for \\"Classic Priest\\" as if they want to go back to 1982.  Quit living in the past.  While you were unable to get past \\"Livin After Midnight,\\" Judas Priest evolved into an unstopable metal machine, culminating in the spectacular metal masterpiece that was Demolition.  Who the hell wants classic rock?  Do you really want your bands to sound exactly the same way they did twenty years ago? <br /> <br />And I'm sick of the endless Ripper bashing, especially when considering Demolition.  If you rip that album, then you don't know what metal is.  I'll bet most of these fans never even listened to Ripper's albums, nor are even metal fans, at least current metal.  They're just Priest fans of a bygone era who want \\"The good old days\\" back, just like the crybaby Metallica fans who haven't moved on past Master of Puppets. <br /> <br />Angel of Retribution is hands down one of the most lackluster, generic, by the numbers albums I've heard recently.  It doesn't sound like an album, so much as ten filler tracks taken from ten other albums.  None of the songs stand out.  They all sound the same musically.  Same beat, same tempo, same key.  There isn't one memorable chorus.  The gutair grinding is sub-par.  And the vocals are woefully underwelming.  The only thing showing any signs of life here are the drums, which a few times showed signs of reaching the thundering glory of the last two albums. <br /> <br />I consider Demolition of of the finest metal productions ever put together.  It is an album of staggering quality and variety.  Every song sounds different, yet they all fit together perfectly.  Each song is a massive wall of sound, mixing roaring gutairs, thunderous drums, pitch perfect electronic distortion, and Ripper's monumental scream.  There was 13 tracks and was a whopping 70 plus minutes long.  Instant metal classics like \\"Machine Man,\\" \\"Hell is Home,\\" \\"Close to You,\\" \\"Bloodsuckers,\\" \\"Feed on Me,\\" and \\"Metal Messiah.\\"  You couldn't ask for more. <br /> <br />Angel of Retribution doesn't come within earshot of matching it.  Hell, Jugulator chews this up and spits it out.  Ten tracks, of which only two cross the five minute mark.  \\"Worth Fighting For,\\" and \\"Angel\\" are the worst examples of filler.  Toss em, cause they're useless.  \\"Lochness\\" appeared for a moment to match the epic glory of Jugulator's \\"Cathedral Spires,\\" but just turns into a random, thirteen minute mess that goes nowhere - slowly.  This leaves the seven \\"metal\\" songs.  They are fine for the most part.  Heavy, but not that heavy.  Fast, but not that fast.  Oddly, they all sound the same.  Like I said, no standout chorus, so you thing you're hearing the same song again and again.  \\"Wheels of Fire\\" at times will make you think you're listening to Metallica's \\"Attitude\\" from Reload, because musically the melodies are near identical. <br /> <br />Could Tipten's writing ability have dropped this much from Demolition?  Where is the variety?  Where is the production values?  The album sounds almost bare compaired to the Ripper albums.  Nor does it compair to Halford's solo albums, which roared to life with tracks like \\"Betrayal,\\" \\"Handing out Bullets,\\" and \\"Wrath of God.\\"  Where's that energy?  Where's that excitement?  Never once does Halford test the limits of his vocal range.  In fact, he highlights his weakness: Rob doesn't have the low-end octave range that Ripper has, so his voice sounds mousey and thin on the slower songs, as opposed to the aggressive growl that it should be. <br /> <br />The best songs I guess are \\"Hellrider,\\" \\"Demonizer,\\" and \\"Judas Rising.\\"  As a metal album, this one is strictly by the books.  There is nothing of note beyond Halford coming back.  I hold my metal to a high standard, a standard that Demolition achieved with flying colors.  This is no Demolition.  This is maybe a step above Ram it Down, but probably not. <br /> <br />Maybe on the next album they'll get over this \\"reunion\\" nonsense and crank out the metal album they should have.
B00000099Y|5.0|I would like to make the point that music is subjective. Not everyone will like Tool. Some will hate Tool. And some will love Tool. That's what makes music such a personal and intimate experience -- it's your individual interpretation of someone else's art. <br /> <br />With that said, this rates as a 5-star album to me. I do not like what Tool the band stand for, but I *love* their music. Strange but true. For me, being able to push aside political agendas to listen to the music itself has always enabled me to appreciate and enjoy music that I otherwise would not have been exposed to.
B000002JPA|5.0|That's what I had to do. Dream Theater's music is like a foreign language: You have to learn it before you can appreciate it. I bought this album in 1992, appreciated the parts that sounded like Metallica, then put it away for five years. Then I learned a lot more about odd time signatures and 1/32 notes. Thirteen years later, I find I&W in my CD player as or more often than any other disc. And it blows me away every time I hear it.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|this is not it, so don't give it a crappy review just because it doesn't sound exactly like deloused. first of all the band has said  many times that they want to PROGRESS with their music, not stay in the same plac. So.. if you want to listen to a band pump out the same cd, with a different title,  every year or so, go listen to green day because this is not for you. That said this cd is amazing !!! cygnus and casandra are the major highlights while miranda and L'via are right up there.  <br />And every one needs to get their hands on the decoder song which is freakin awesome, i wish it would have come in a package with the cd because everyone needs to hear this one.
0451169514|5.0|Arguably the most accomplished novel by pop lit god Stephen King, \\"IT\\" maintains a chokehold on the reader; both frightening and gripping, it's brilliantly paced and a wonderful read. <br /> <br />     Derry, Maine is the smalltown setting for this and several other King shockers; indeed, King seems hellbent on rooting out the evil under the surface of rural America, and he manages to write distinctively American tales in the process. The indeterminate nature of the terror that hides in Derry is crucial to this book's themes of childhood fears and trauma, as is its avatar, Pennywise the clown. While The Stand told a story grander in breadth and setting, \\"IT\\" spans a longer period of time, while staying close to the main characters and giving the reader a real sense of them as people. The story itself is brilliantly structured and strings the reader along as only King can manage; the four protagonists encounter IT as children, and then again as adults, and King runs the narratives parallel to one another, heightening the tension and the sense of foreboding. <br />      <br />This is interspersed with bits of the history of Derry, giving the reader a little more insight into the evil in the town, and in the townspeople. The modest scale of the epic story makes the sacrifices at the end all the more bittersweet, and the characters worth revisiting.
B000051VWW|4.0|Very good album. But very very sad. I think Sade or someone in her band got their heart broken and wrote  about that over and over. Also Sade's father passed away, so that was the focus of the album. I hope Sade and her band are okay and will write peaceful happy songs from now on.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|I didn't think I would ever say this was a good movie. It took me about 20 minutes to really get into it. Shaun leads such a dead lifestyle, which is what makes it so funny. The dialogue is fantastic, and I don't know about everyone else, but some moments actually made me jump. It reminded me of the Scream films in this aspect. I could laugh my head off and be sort of scared at the same time.  <br /> <br />Shaun's girfriend, Liz, breaks up with him because he does nothing. He plays video games, hangs out at the pub, and is unaware of what is happening around him, so much so that he wakes up one morning to find a zombie girl in his backyard and thinks she's just drunk. That is, until she tries to bite him, and he pushes her away and she falls onto a pole that goes through her stomach and she's still \\"alive.\\" So weird. He decides that the best thing to do would be to go get his mom, his ex-girl, and go to the pub, which is of course, a safe place to hide. Yeah. Right. The ending had me laughing so hard I thought I would die. And actually, I began to think that if such zombies took over, this ending could be what could happen! Ha ha ha... <br /> <br />Anyway, I definitely recommend this movie. You may be a little unimpressed at first, but trust me, stick with this one. I almost quit watching it, and I'm so glad that I kept with it because I am so not disappointed in this movie! It's funny, kinda scary, campy-- everything that a REALLY GREAT SPOOF should have!
B0007O38F8|1.0|Before I heard this cd I was sure it was going to be great. I thought it would be close to the same level as \\"Get rich or die trying\\" but boy was I wrong. This cd was just plain bad. There is too much emphasis on trying to make another club joint that will be hot like \\"In da club\\" was. His lyrical skills were never great but the beats in the first album helped. This cd lacks good beats thus his lyrics are lackluster. I certainly don't recommend you buy this album. Instead you could buy The Documentary which is a way better album.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|I'm thankful for: <br />--Rob being back where he belongs. <br />--The band dropping that horrible microchip digital guitar tone of the past couple albums. <br />Other than that, being a Priest fan for the better part of 20 years, I can't say this really knocked my socks off. I honestly like Rob's HALFORD debut album better than this. This is basically Metal-by-numbers, but at least it's METAL. <br />My biggest complaint is the lyrical content. It is beyond cheesey here. More than ever before. Nearly every song has some allusion to past lyrics or songs, which is ridiculous. <br />Examples:  <br />\\"Forged in the black country, under blood red skies...\\" <br />\\"Time to Ram it down, judgement for the tyrant\\" <br />Or the absolute worst offender: \\"They remain still as stained class.\\" UGH! What is that all about?!?! Let's not live in the past, guys.  <br />The opener \\"Judas Rising\\" begins with a little riff reminiscent of the intro to \\"Victim of Changes\\", and is a decent headbanger of a song. \\"Deal With the Devil\\" is completely identical in message to \\"Monsters of Rock\\" from Ram It Down. You know, the typical \\"we have always been metal and got more famous with time blah blah blah\\". Enough already! We've heard that before! Must they always sing about themselves?! <br />A couple obligatory ballads here and there. yippee...Otherwise \\"Hellrider\\" is a decent song, as is the doom-by-numbers \\"Loch Ness\\" (or Lochness as it's printed here).  <br />Perhaps the biggest disappointment of all is the blatant lack of shredding solos. Glenn and K.K. aren't exactly burning up the fretboards anymore, if you know what I mean. These aren't Painkiller solos on this album.  <br />I honestly wasn't expecting anything too earth shattering, and my expectations were met. It's good to hear some real metal, but there isn't anything completely groundbreaking on offer. This album's biggest fans will be those with status quo standards who simply want to RAWK and not get too cerebral with their metal. It's not Defenders of the Faith part two, unfortunately. <br />I'd rate the cd a strong 3 stars, but add one for the dvd, which is worth the price alone.  <br />

B0007GAEW6|3.0|I am not here to tell anyone theyre wrong. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. And the fact that everyone is attacking each others opinions as if it were a personal battle is kind of weird and disturbing. Anyone who disagrees with my review of this album, i have no problem with your opinions, just let me have mine, please? When i see a five-star review and it has reason behind it, thats fine, but the mars volta has a huge cult following and it seems like people are afraid to admit Frances the Mute is less pleasing and enjoyable than tremulant and Deloused. Ambient noise for dramatic and story-telling effect is not something unique to the mars volta. They also use it to a level that is just not needed. There are some real highlights on this album that are similar to the songs on the two previous albums that are just awesome and fun. Cedric Bixler's voice has come so far since the At the Drive-in days and Omar can be brilliant when hes not trying to make a statement. I found the widow to be a bit boring, even though it really isnt a bad song, and cygnus has a few deloused-like moments, but cassandra geminni is just too long and too incoherent for my taste. 15 seconds of silence before the first chorus on Cicatriz ESP on deloused is completely awesome, but long drawn out periods of white noise between and within every track are not needed and are wasting the listeners time. They have so much talent and so much creativity when it comes to the possibilites of music, but this album tends to be boring, despite its sparks of inspiration. I recommend people burn the useful tracks on this cd if they are only kind of into the mars volta. i bought the cd because ive always been a die-hard fan of at the drive in, sparta, and the mars volta, but this album is not something i would just be dying to listen to over and over. And thats something people forget in all the statements bands are trying to make these days, one listens to music because it sounds good. Its cool that this is an abstract artistic concept album, but it just doesnt have enough parts that sound good to me for my taste.
B0001IN07Q|1.0|Take classic material, give it to a decent voice, and put video cameras in the hands of idiots and this is what you get. The editing is totally disrespectful to the material; and, then, you have to wonder why Buble didn't have the brains to realize that it's dispresectful to him, as well. Why would anyone with a measurable IQ ever consent to a project like this one, in which the goal was obviously to distract the listener's/viewer's attention from the performance? You've got to wonder. <br /> <br />Well, the goal was achieved. And that's for starters. It gets worse. Shameful. What a waste. Next time, Michael, hire a producer who's stopped sucking his thumb and who's old enough to drive.
B000002J1L|5.0|Of all the genesis lp's threw out the years, only this lp and the first & last track can send the shivers up the old spine and truly harken back to victorian days gone by!  The first album that featured drummer Phil Collins and new guitarist Steven Hackett. The new Genesis Box set  1970-1975  released in january 2009 has the first 4 charisma  lps in 5.1 surround sound remastered format with extra interviews and rare clips like the belgium 1972 tv show witch shows this incarnation of the band at its first beginnings. But this lp was the first \\"real\\" genesis lp. A must for anyone who has the curiosity to expand their musical horizons.

He has a talanted crew and no one can mess with them..As far as Piggy Bank goes Jada and Fat Joe were dissing 50 for a while on the mixtapes he is just responding..Plus this will help Jada boost his sales since he cant seem to hit the million copies mark..If he is so good why cant he sell a million? Fat Joe sucks and should not respond to 50. And make was not loyal so he is OUT! what a stupid move on games part he should have kept quiet and and not got involved with 50's beef.

This CD has been Unleashed in the East, not to mention the West, North and South! Now, I lets see how this will sound (Priest...) LIVE!
B00064MW6A|3.0|I wouldn't say this movie is bad, but I wouldn't say it was good either.  It was actually a little bit of both. Part of it was good, but then it would get really cheesy...Then, just as we were about to turn it off (for the cheese-factor), it would get better again.  The acting in the movie was good, but the story-line was very weak.  It had a lot of potential, but it just wasn't developed properly.  I wouldn't say it was a total waste of time, but it definitely isn't something you would want to see more than once!

B0007N1AI6|5.0|Top to bottom, one of the best Priest releases. Riffs are great and the Metal God is in top form. Great variety on this disc and that says alot considering there are just 10 songs. Give me 10 great songs over 15-20 mediocre songs any day. Buy it and the 2 disc version now! Priest! Priest! Priest! <br />
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This CD is incredible.  While it isn't great as Deloused in the Comatorium, it definitely has its high points.  Honestly I dislike most of Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore, but the awesome sound of L'via L'viaquez more than makes up for it.  Buy this CD!  I got mine today.

B00006BIO0|3.0|There are both good and bad things about this set. The 5 discs of very rare and valuable material make up a rather incredible compilation. The layout of the inserts is somewhat user-friendly; requiring the listener to pull individual CDs out in order to locate artists. The discography information does not include song titles, which causes a lot of back-and-forth cross-reading. A little confusing. <br /> <br />The sound quality is only fair; when I compare these to Yazoo reissues, I feel like there is no presence in the JSP versions. Too much treble has been rolled off. <br /> <br />My biggest concern is that I believe I recognize many of these remastered sides from other reissues. A little 'tweaking' to try and hide their origin doesn't do the trick. Is this just a 5 CD set of bootlegs? This bothers me for the original engineers who found the recordings and did all the work, just to have it lifted and reissued at a cheaper price by another company.

0767803434|5.0|President Jim Marshall (Ford) has just taken a powerful stand against genocide in Russia.  US Special Ops along with Russian units have captured General Raddick, who is responsible for a reign of terror and hundreds of thousands of deaths. In his speech, Marshall admits the USA had waited too long and that they won't do this again---because it is the 'right thing to do.'     The Prez isn't exactly returning to the USA in triumph, though.  His National Security Advisor doesn't agree with him and the 'doves' among the Administration are thinking this is an open call of war.      Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman) and a team of Russian bad guys manage to sneak onboard Air Force One and take over the plane.  They believe the Prez took the escape pod and left his staff, wife, and daughter to die.  What they don't know is that Marshall (a Medal of Honor winnter) is still onboard and is working to take back his plane.    Action is almost nonstop in this 1997 Wolfgang Peterson film and if you can believe Air Force One can withstand the beating its taken, you can also believe the US could have a hero as a President.  Still, this is a film that you can re-run whenever you need a taste of action and adventure.  Nobody does heroics like Harrison Ford.
B0007O38F8|1.0|The above is an understatement.<br /><br />What the hell is wrong with 50? 'Disco Inferno'? 'Candy Shop'? 'Gatman and Robin'? This whole album is total crap, do NOT waste any resources on this garbage. If you enjoy this music then you have probably been drugged beyond repair from his vitamin water and crappy clothing.
B00005JKN9|1.0|The glorification and celebration (not merely the depiction) of extreme physical violence has been a dominant theme in American cinema for the last 30 years.  Tarantino presents his bloodletting with a verve and wit that at least maintains the aesthetic integrity of his films.  In Gangs of New York, Scorsese has no such excuse.  This is literal and graphic butchery, designed to disturb and nauseate.  His film set of nineteenth-century New York is avowedly theatrical rather than realistic and becomes a latter-day Coliseum in which are enacted scenes of gladiatorial slaughter.  The violence itself is realistic yet inauthentic, by which I mean it is heavily stylized and ritualized.  It portrays the imaginative cruelty typical of religious and political persecution rather than the workmanlike, crude brutality more characteristic of gang killings.  Situations are set up in artificial and implausible ways in order to provide opportunities for bloodier and nastier acts.<br /><br />The plot is cobbled together from incidents and characters culled from Herbert Asbury's \\"The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the Underworld\\", a 1927 concoction of lurid journalism and dubious anecdote.<br /><br />The irony is that the few concessions to historical truth that the movie makes are what has denied it wide acceptance by American audiences.  It shows the brutal hostility with which Irish immigrants were received in the New World and the terrible suffering they encountered there.  To a people comfortable with the well-established myth of poor Irish families escaping British tyranny to find freedom and prosperity in America, these truths are unacceptable.  The riots that form the climax of the movie are actual but little-known events, and the manner in which the rioters targeted blacks is not the least uncomfortable fact.  It is this indigestible history that curbed the movie's success, not the extreme violence, which it struggled despite, rather than because of.<br /><br />America today is a land where a little nudity, even when tastefully or humorously presented, on the large or small screen, provokes outrage, censorship and penalty, but the most pornographically explicit violence passes relatively unremarked.  Watch this movie if you must but, in the name of Humanity, please keep it from your children.re a little nudity, even when tastefully or humorously presented, on the large or small screen, provokes outrage, censorship and penalty, but the most pornographically explicit violence passes relatively unremarked.

B000003TA4|5.0|this cd, will never be forgotten. It is the greatest thing i have ever heard. Now before i get to the review, i want to get out all my anger i have for the people like reviewer \\"grunge is dead\\". The backstreet boys of rock huh? how are they the backstreet boys of rock? backstreet boys werent huge, the backstreet boys arent legends neither. And you really think that nirvana was rich kids who lived in the suburbs? read heavier then heaven the biography of kurt cobain, The guy who wrote it went through 400 interviews and 4 years of research to do it. Kurt cobain and Krist novoselic were poor, i dont know about dave grohl, it doesnt tell much about his young age. Kurt cobain didnt fake anything, have u not heard the cd bleach? of course its original, all there cds are orriginal. And just so you know, after they released the cd nevermind kurt found out he was attracting the kind of fans he hated. Kurt didnt even like smells like teen spirit that much. Dave grohl hated it. Half the people in here who are saying that nirvana sucks and they were whiney and that they made up stuff, dont know crap. You havnt read any of nirvanas biographies, ive read 3. <br />now to get on to the review <br /> <br />SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT - The greatest song ever wrote , 10/10 <br />IN BLOOM - One of my favorite songs 10/10 <br />COME AS YOU ARE - This song is ok, gets old after a while, 8/10 <br />BREED - fast and hardcore, ok, not that great, 8/10 <br />LITHIUM- Definetly one of the greatest songs ive ever heard, 10/10 <br />POLLY - anti rape song based on a true story, very good, 9/10 <br />TERRITORIAL PISSINGS - actually a song about how girls should rule the world, read the chosen rejects biography to learn that, 9/10 <br />DRAIN YOU - ok song, nothing to speacial, very cool part in the middle, 9/10 <br />LOUNGE ACT- awesome song, never gets old , 10/10 <br />STAY AWAY - orriginally called pay to play, pretty good, gets old after a while, 9/10 <br />ON A PLAIN - definetly one of my favorites, cool lyrics, 10/10 <br />SOMETHING IN THE WAY - story about how kurt cobain lived under a bridge for a short period of time, slow and boring, 7/10
0375759174|4.0|If you become interesting in this book, please read it before seeing the movie.  The movie is disapionting due to liberties taken.  This book is darker than other Jane Austen classics, but still worth a look.

B0007N1AI6|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I liked Priest when Ripper was with the band, he was an awesome stand-in but it just isn't the same without Halford. I am glad that Halford went out and explored some new frontiers for himself and I think that he brings back those experiences with him to this album. Some of the reviews on here have panned the album as not being like the \\"old Priest\\".  Judas Priest has always been about exploring new frontiers and taking metal to places it has never been before.  This album has quite a variety for every listener.  Do yourself a favor and buy this album. It is an excellent addition to any collection. You will see why Judas Priest has been such a big influence to so many bands over the years. <br /> <br />I guess if I had to make some negative comments on the Angel of Retribution it would be that I would much rather have seen a 2-hour DVD of Judast Priest Live.  They made a swing up to Sacramento on a day off from the Ozzfest tour and played, quite simply, the best concert I have ever seen (I have been going to see Judas Priest on every tour for over 20 years, so that is saying something!). It would have been awesome to see them sing all the hits they did on that tour, and I think, just blown everyone totally away.
0670033375|4.0|Guns, Germs, and Steel discussed the rise of civilization and now Collapse speaks too soon of its possible demise.<br /><br />Jared Diamond is a brilliant thinker and writer. He paints, with broad strokes, \\"the big picture\\".  Both books are lengthy.  In Collapse, his second volume of the set, he draws his story to a close by listing the problems we now face.<br /><br />That's correct, after reading a thousand pages we are left with a list of problems and a glimmer of hope.<br /><br />Perhaps the next book will focus on solutions.  We want answers!
B0007N1AI6|5.0|I have been a Priest fan most of my adult life and have seen them more times than I can remember. It was a devastating blow when Rob left and even though Ripper did his best, there is no comparison.  <br /> <br />THE TIME HAS COME LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.   <br /> <br />THE PRIEST IS BACK..... and with a fury like we haven't heard for years. <br />I can hear a mix of British Steel, Painkiller, Sad Wings and Hell Bent For Leather all wrapped up in one on ANGEL OF RETRIBUTION. I can't express how strong the whole cd sounds. Rob's vocals are strong, Glenn and KK are tighter than they ever have been. Ian's bass, especially on the opening of Revolution, is stellar and Scott is using that double bass drum like a fighter pilot on an attack run. I can't wait to see them live in 2005, take my word for it, if you have never seen Judas Priest, GO! This is Priest at it's best.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|I, like many others here, loved De-Loused, and consider it to be, by far, one of the best albums in my collection.  I was really looking forward to The Mars Volta's next CD, ever since I heard \\"The Widow\\" on my radio station (the late great Y100). <br /> <br />I think that was my problem.  I was expecting something more like \\"Deloused vol. II\\", and that's simply not what this album is.  At first I was a little turned off to it, but then I remembered how long it took me to really get into The Mars Volta's sound originally. <br /> <br />Now that I've given it the time to sink in, and have given it a fair listen, I am really starting to like this latest accomplishment by The Mars Volta.  I still like Deloused more, but this is by no means a dissapointment. <br /> <br />-1 star for the frequent use of spanish lyrics.  I can't speak spanish and I'd rather be able to understand what he's singing about.  But that's just me.
B00006L83N|5.0|This is definitely the best album that Symphony X has ever put together.  Excellent all around.  Very quality material, especially \\"The Odyssey\\", which ranks among the best epic songs, or just songs, of all time.    Production is top notch, as are the musicians.  Michael Romeo is definitely a guitar icon, and one thing I am sick of hearing about is how he sounds like Yngwie.  HAS ANYONE EVER HEARD YNGWIE?!?!?!  He plays the simplest rhythms for every song, with an arpeggiated chorus and solos in a harmonic minor key.  Every song!!  What does Romeo do?  He composes, writes brilliant, flowing rhythms, beautiful solos (in which he uses a lot more than harmonic minor scales, like wholetone, diminished, seventh, minor seventh, well, you get the picture) and writes all of his solos into the music.  Not to mention he also has a very innovative and difficult to replicate tapping technique. Yngwie just solos in the same scale structure.  So how do they sound similiar?   Just a little rant, sorry to take away from the review.  But if you want a heavy, progressive album, buy this one.  If you want a more symphonic, less raw album, check out their offering \\"V\\".  Either way, you're in for some great music.      Note to DT fans:  Note how I didn't rip Petrucci, I admire him just as much as Romeo, for his different, more chord-structured rhythms and wonderful solo taste.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm one of those new Firefly fans. One of the many who had never seen it on tv, but got the chance to see the dvds, and are now addicted and unfulfilled. I am a long time Buffy fan (I own every season), and even though my friends are shocked to hear it, Firefly is better. The first time I saw it I stayed up until the wee hours of the morning watching it. I finished the whole dvd set in one night/morning. When I finally finished the last episode, it hit me...there won't be anymore. I was immediately sorry that I had crammed it all into one night insted of enjoying it over several, and now I've seen the whole season three times in one month. There was so much left undone, and unsaid. I like to see the end of things, call me crazy. Even if I know it will suck (ie: Matrix Revolutions), I still want to know how something is going to end. I was happy to hear there was going to be a movie, although I still have yet to hear a release date, and interested in seeing how Joss does after doing tv shows for so long. The only thing that worries me is that Firefly, like all good tv shows, was meant to unfurl over an extended period of time, whereas movies have very limited time. But I have faith in Joss, as Fox should've had. So basically what I'm trying to say is that in my opinion, Firefly was and is the best show I've ever seen. And I too am counting the days...if only I knew how many I had to count.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|I don't get it.  Everyone I've talked to absolutely loved this movie, but good god, how?  It was the most mind-numbing, sleep-inducing movie I have ever sat through.

0743424425|3.0|The problem I have with The Shining... is The Shining... the gift of second sight, is never really dealt with that well in the book except how it ends up sending someone mad. The horror is much better in the book though than the film and the story is different in many parts, most importantly the animal hedge rows, and some other plot elements. A haunted hotel is the main theme, combined with a family that has the gift, but to be honest King rips the ending from the original Axeman dad gone wild on the family story, by Jay Anson, who wrote The Amityville Horror before this book. The two books so similar that it is hard to imagine that King did not know where his influence was directly coming from. It happens, The Shining, not as original as it tries to be, is really only a very average shabby king novel that would rate next to Cujo as one of his older works to pass on by.<br /><br />For some reason Kubrick tried to pass off a very long and boring remake of this tale that seems to make people think that the original book is a somewhat classic in King's collection. It is only a very average King book and not all it is made out to be as some others have wisely noted.
B00005JLEU|1.0|I thought this movie was obnoxious. Maybe its meaning was lost in translation from Japanese to English, however, its the director's responsiblity to make sure that does not happen.  <br />I thought that maybe my presupposition was a little uncultivated, so I resorted to independent arguments from friends. They, for the most part, felt inebriated and uninterested in the first 15 minutes of the film. Even though they were the ones who labored through the entire insane, prosaic, and venal \\"toon\\", they felt that I should reimburse them for the time that they wasted when each one of them would have been better off shaving their hairy asses with toothpaste and a butter knife....  Anyways, I just glanced over some of the reviews and was dumbfounded at the rave reviews that people gave this movie. I still shiver when I see the front cover of this movie anywhere..... I keep telling myself \\"Don't worry, go to your happy place.... You don't have to go through that again\\". <br />I am an addict when it comes to Anime. My favorite movies are Ghost in the Shell and Akira, so its not that I don't like Japanese animation, I just do not like to watch bogus fragments of someones feebleminded imagination.
B000002U82|5.0|A few years ago, I was downloading some music and decided to look for complete albums.  Dark Side of the Moon was the only album I downloaded successfully, so I burned it to a CD and took a listen.  At first, I didn't think this so called \\"classic\\" album was anything special.  I mean, come on, the first few minutes isn't even music.  It's a ticking clock, a sound like a heartbeat, some maniacal laughter, and other background noise.  But once the music starts, you'll be blown away.  I really hate the way the album wanders, with nothing but weird noise in the background to tide you over between tracks, but the real songs on here are superb.  I know that the meandering background noise is sort of the glue that holds this album together and makes it complete, but it's just not good listening.  As for the songs themselves, Time is probably the best on the album, and one of Pink Floyd's better songs.  I love The Great Gig in the Sky because I'm an accomplished pianist and the song fits the album's theme of insanity.  The wailing woman featured in Gig is a perfect symbol of encroaching insanity.  Money is solid, so is Us and Them.  But the album closes perfectly with Brain Damage (very fitting title, considering the song's lyrics) and Eclipse.  The lyrics to both of these songs are unmatched.  I remember being in shock the first time I listened to the complete album.  I couldn't believe how good it was.  This album is a perfect example of what all other albums should be: a group of songs that follow a specific theme seamlessly, instead of just a collection of singles thrown together.  Dark Side of the Moon is an artistic accomplishment.  Very few albums can be considered true art, in my opinion.  So, despite a few minutes of rambling sound, the album is as close to perfect as you'll find out there.  There is no dark side of the moon really...matter of fact, it's all dark.
B00006LI4S|5.0|This video exceeded my expectations.  It's sound and video are  excellent.  Gilmours voice and guitar is wonderful. Accompanied  by a mixed ensemble with choral at certain times in background.  Comfortably Numb, awesome as always.  David Gilmour is one of y favorite guitarists next to Buchanan and Hendrix.  I can't   believe I got this for 4 dollars after shipping and hanling. If  you only like as Pink Floyd, then get Pink Floyd.  This dvd is  mostly acoustic with some electric and slide.  Listening to his voice, never knew he sung any of Floyds tunes, but most of it sounds like Floyds vocals? Fresh, new way to hear old tunes. At  worst you may call this dvd tame, but it's tame with a grand sparkle.  Good extras, though maybe an interview would have been nice.  Shine on you crazy diamond is great as well.
B00004ZD69|5.0|Lately my bank account has gone dry to the point that i've gotten letters threatening to shut it down for one simple reason: post-rock albums. Now, when i trun on my cd player, i usually don't expect some sort of heaven light or hell fire coming down onto my headphones and balsting away demonic or heavenly meaning into my brain. What I do expect on the other hand, is music. Let's remeber, folks, that these are musicians. They are NOT some sort of holy preachers. The only meaning one can decipher from instrumntal music is a meaning that is entirley yours. so keep it to yourself. and hopefully, don't recycle it. <br /> <br />That said, this is mind-shatteringly good music. It starts out with 'storm', an almost joyous melody that's drilled into your head and makes you want to leave your body out of pure ecstacy, much like Shpongle (which might not be post rock, but anyone who I have forced to listen to it has agreed that orgasmic would be a slight understatement.) This ecstasy generally becomes toned down by the time you reach the beginning of 'static'. Background sounds that almost seem copied, if at a lower volume, from \\"The Downward Spiral\\". Sonn you will be abandoning your happy world built by storms and beginning to crawl inside your own skin. Soon, this develops into a pulsing mass of drums and reapeting guitars and a crazilly developing tempo, which will enevitablly evoke a \\"HOLY S#!T\\" or two from pure amazement. The second CD, well, figure out which parts can be calssified as \\"orgasmic\\" on your own.
B000000WCV|2.0|I was really disappinted with this album because I'd bought discovery before this one and it was a great funky cd.Now,my theory is that the 1st album of every artist ever, is always their best..Boy was I wrong...and a half!Homework absoloutly squashed that idea completely! After hearing the classic 'Around The World'(in my opinion their best song ever) i thought the album would reflect this. As soon as i heard the beginning track 'dafizetrse' or watever its called, i had an instinct that the album would suck..and it did. Don't bother with this album, the only 3 good songs (out of 16 tracks) are Around The World,Teachers and Oh Yeah. The rest are just noise. So, in a nutshell, this album stinks worse than a hobo, get discovery instead.

0471267554|5.0|I am a medical doctor and have studied diet since I was a high school athlete.  While not perfect, this book outlines the basic principles of paleolithic eating.  It gives the paleolithic background, scientific rationale and practical instructions.  Adoption of this diet in the USA would plummet our health care costs across the board.   <br /> <br />There is a mounting body of evidence that diet is important in mental health issues as well.  This even extends to violent behavior, particularly in our deficient omega-three fatty acids and excessive omega-six fatty acids.  Here is a huge benefit that could cut down on criminal court costs and incarceration, not to mention quality of life. <br /> <br />My objections are few.  Cooking flax is questionable.  Canola is a genetically engineered alteration of a toxic substance, the rapeseed.  He probably maligns saturated fats too much.  The answer here is probably more moderate than the Atkins-esque and the author's more polarized rec's. <br /> <br />Finally personal experience...  I found myself in 1999 at 230# at 6'3.\\"  I started eating low grain diet (a daily serving), moderate produce and plenty of animal protein, fat and all (meat, seafood, eggs, cheese).  I cheated a few times a week and drank beer a few times a week.  In two months I lost twenty pounds and was a muscular athletic looking guy again.  My girlfriend said I was \\"hot\\"-at age 39.  Of course I drifted off and got up to 250 this last holiday season.  I have been gradually eating more this way and already lost 12 pounds and feel much better.  And this while exercise is limited by multiple injuries.  This may not seem very impressive, but it is when you consider I'm not really more than doing a partial version here and not getting enough exercise.
B0006399FS|5.0|THIS CD IS VERY VERY GOOD. It's ok to dislike it of course, but it's really sad and weird to be so unfair about it. It's not anything as bad as some of the strange sad people who write multiple negative reviews under many fake accounts here are saying even to the most discriminating people. To me, it's another great CD from U2 who's worst CD remains \\"October\\". <br /> <br />Also, there's another weirdo who thinks he's so clever writing idiotic fake positive reviews when he already wrote (and re-posted numerous times--gdb) a very daft and irrationally negative review. <br /> <br />I'm not part of U2's marketing team and I really love this CD. It's so sad to read so many negative reviews of this CD. It reminds me of when Pop came out and the same happened and now, generally, people consider Pop a great CD. If you're a new buyer, I'd have to recommend trying this CD for yourself. For some reason, a lot of negative people who seem to have different tastes than those who like U2's music have chimed in here. This is a SOLID CD! It shines above so much else out there (except for, maybe, Ian Brown's Solarized which is a TOP CD.) <br /> <br />Oh, also, see Necromancing's alternate track order below, he (or she!) is on to something. I programmed that track order in iTunes and it's really good!!! <br /> <br />So, here's my original review: <br /> <br />Ok, I've absorbed this CD for a couple weeks now and about 15 listens. I didn't exactly dig it at first, but then I realized I was humming \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" or \\"All Because of You\\" when I least expected it. Now, I see it for what it is...another HIGH QUALITY U2 release. <br /> <br />They have such an ability to tap into human emotions, redemption, kindness, support, strength, weakness. It's enlightening and self-revealing to listen to their recent CDs. My interpretation, although not literally what they're doing is, instead of pointing outward to political social issues, they point inwards at their feelings and the feelings of loved ones. <br /> <br />I think one of their best songs ever is on this CD. My personal favorite: \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" which is a loving, emotional tribute to Bono's dad, who passed away recently and who he claims in the song was the reason Bono sings. It really brings tears to my eyes when listening to it sometimes. It has that lovely crescendo near the end where the whole song explodes in a wonderful outburst. <br /> <br />Vertigo is catchy as hell and rocks very well--especially for U2. Great guitar tone from the Edge. The ONLY song I'm not extremely fond of is \\"Man And A Woman\\" because it sounds pretty cheesy to me. I like the lyrics, but not the music, oddly enough. I'd give it 4 and 1/2 stars because of that song. <br /> <br />The rest is pure U2 genius. Frankly, saying it was \\"a lame effort\\" or \\"they're past their prime\\" is JUST an opinion (and a off-the-mark one at that if you ask me). A LOT of work goes into a U2 CD. They have integrity beyond belief and their effort shows. <br /> <br />I think they're creating mature, wonderful music to this day and in many regards are writing better music than ever. It comes across as genuine and mature instead of simply self-righteous like their older music (which I LOVE too, it's just a subtle change in the emotional content). <br /> <br />The Edge is brilliant as always--as are some of the great basslines from Adam and beats from Larry. If you're not expecting War II and have a fairly open mind (with some good taste thrown in) you'll probably like this. It's destined to be a classic.
B0007O38F8|5.0|If u dont like the album u have problems and u dont know really n e thing about rap and all u like is those catchy lil club beats....he switched his flow and its awesome...this will sell more then 11 million just watch.
B000058983|4.0|...docked a notch for using cheesy strings instead of a mellotron, or farfisa ... even.
B0002S947K|5.0|What an incredible debut album.   First, this is an excellent collection of songs. Some are bluesy, some a bit country-ish (Austin sound), others have a jazz vibe. There's not a dud on the cd. Then there's Ray's voice.  It's earthy, sinuous,velvety and soulful. He reminds me at times of Otis Redding, Al Green, and Van Morrison. Can't wait for Ray's next.
B0007MVXQG|5.0|This is awesome. Has something for the fans from all the decades. Not really a weak song on here. I found myself already humming a couple songs to myself the hooks are that good. You might have to give Lochness a couple spins but you will think it kicks.
0743454529|3.0|Jodi Picoult's \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" is about the terrible toll that a long-term, life-threatening illness takes on a family.  Brian and Sara Fitzgerald are the devoted parents of two children, Kate and Jesse.  When Kate is diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia, her parents decide to have another child who will be genetically compatible with Kate.  This child, Anna, donates bone marrow to her sister and helps prolong her life.  However, as time goes on, Kate relapses again and again, and Anna is asked to undergo further painful procedures to help her sister.  Anna feels like a victim herself.  She wonders if her whole life will be defined by Kate's illness.<br /><br />Jodi Picoult effectively explores how Kate's medical condition affects the dynamics of her family.  The Fitzgeralds and their children experience a roller coaster of emotions--hope when Kate goes into remission and disappointment when she has a setback.  Sara and Brian are exhausted from constantly being on the alert as Kate's condition changes, often without warning.  Kate's illness affects her siblings psychologically, as well. Anna and Jesse feel that they are extensions of Kate.  The sick sister is the center of attention, since she is the one who may die at any moment.  Jesse becomes a surly, rebellious, and destructive teenager.  For a long time, Anna is compliant.  However, when Kate's kidneys begin to fail, Anna refuses to donate one of her own kidneys to save her sister's life.  She even retains a lawyer who initiates a court case on her behalf.<br /><br />\\"My Sister's Keeper\\" is a well-meaning book with a heart-rending and dramatic theme.  Picoult tells her story from different points of view in alternating chapters.  This approach enables the reader to empathize with and understand how each individual feels.  However, too many contrived plot developments ultimately weaken the novel's impact.  In addition, the writing is often heavy-handed and maudlin. A romance between Anna's lawyer, Campbell Alexander, and Julia, a woman whom he loved years ago, is forced; it doesn't fit in with the rest of the novel.  Most disturbing of all, instead of honestly handling Anna's decision about whether or not to donate her kidney, Picoult takes herself off the hook in a manner that had me shaking my head in disbelief.  This is too bad, since \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" had the potential to be a compelling and thought-provoking story about how far we should go to help the people we love.nd Julia, a woman whom he loved years ago, is forced; it doesn't fit in with the rest of the novel.

B0007MVXQG|5.0|I have listened to every song on Angel Of Retribution and I have to rank it as one of the all time Judas Priest classics. The sounds and songs on this CD are as diverse in sound as the band has been spanning their entire 30 year career.  <br /> <br />While \\"Wheels of Fire\\" and \\"Demonizer\\" are Painkiller-esque, they have other tunes such as \\"Deal With the Devil\\" which is more like from \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\". \\"Worth Fighting For\\" would fit well on Hell Bent for Leather. The ballad \\"Angel\\", if it were on \\"Sad Wings of Destiny\\", would already be an all time classic as well as \\"Eulogy\\". \\"Revolution\\" sounds like some of the grinding classics of \\"Sin After Sin\\" and would fit right in with the other songs on it. \\"Loch Ness\\" is not a simple \\"metal\\" song, but more of a \\"rock opera\\" artsy style piece along the lines of \\"Beyond the Realms of Death\\".  <br /> <br />If you want all hard 100 mph grinding stuff go buy some \\"thrash\\", if you want some band crunching the same chords at different tempos and a singer \\"growling\\" in the mic go buy some \\"nu-metal\\" or \\"death metal\\", but if you want some real straight forward classic heavy metal in its truest form buy \\"Angel of retribution\\" by Judas Priest. You will not be disappointed.  <br /> <br />I would recommend dishing out the extra $10 to get the version with the CD and Bonus DVD than the dual disk.  From what I have read some people have had a problem with the dual disks format not working on older CD players plus the extra footage on the bonus DVD which is not on the shortend dual disk video is worth it. <br /> <br />
B0007N1AI6|5.0|Purchased my copy of \\"Angel of Retribution\\" and the whole CD/Album rocks!!!  This CD is one of the best they have done.  It has some of the classic elements, plus a slight new sound to it.  But, there is the definite Judas Priest sound!  I cannot get enough of this CD!  The DVD that comes with it is really good too.   <br /> <br />Can't Wait until they come in conert here in TX. <br /> <br />Tony
B0007MVXQG|5.0|This was a CD that I wanted to have on the first day it came out. The last Priest outing with Halford, Painkiller was their best since Screaming For Vengence. Somehow I knew I would not be disappointed with Angel Of Retribution. Sure, they are almost my grandparents age, but they still have what it takes. To be honest, this CD is really a 4, as the songs are classic Priest style but not quite as powerful as Screaming For Vengence, Painkiller, or Stained Class. They get the extra point from me because despite their age they have the balls to get up there and dish out a nearly perfect metal album with the exception of a few trite lyrics, which I think is just a carry over from the Turbo period.I forgive them for Turbo and Ram It Down. I blame Corporate America for those coasters. Anyway, back to Angel Of Retribution. All the songs on this CD are good. The only song that I found weak or maybe just short of par was Lochness. Think about it. The title has 'goofy' written all over it, but it is just one mans opinion. The bottom line is they pulled it off and you can't knock Judas Priest because they took Black Sabbeth's lead and pushed it up one more notch to give us Heavy Metal. I wonder how many of todays young acts will still be standing and staying true to their own legacy when they are entering their golden years. I bet not many.      The DVD side is merely a bonus. There's an acoustic version of Diamonds and Rust on it that is worth the price of the disc and I would have purchased Angel Of Retribution even without the bonus material. Hail, Judas Priest - the metal gods.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|Just kidding.  The PR influence is all over this record.  I just finished listening to it for the first time and it will take some time to get into it.  Still, I think the payoff will be worth it.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|Ican already guess what you will say.  The words, \\"another year, another Cannibal Corpse album\\" just ecaped your brain from your mouth and/or keyboard.  Sure you can think that.  You'd be WRONG, but you'd think that.  Let me show you what you (would have if not for my interference) missed. <br /> <br />Let's start at the beginning, shall we?  Severed Head Stoning kicks things off somewhat deceptively, in that this tune works in a slightly punky method.  No thinking, just ROCK.  Just to keep you on your toes.  Psychotic Precision Starts with a more modern addition to the Cannibal Corpse sound: polyrhythms.  The really uninitiated would swear that Corpse is riffing off Meshuggah.  The next real highlight of the album is Decency Defied, and this would be the single if MTV was half-way inclined to play death metal videos on TRL.  The groove on this track would've made &lt;A HREF=\\"[...]\\">Dimebag&lt;/A HREF> proud.  Frantic Disembowelment is another headsnapping experience(pun somewhat intended). <br />I'll stop at this since brevity is the soul of wit.  Suffice to say, when(not if)you purchase this CD, do listen to the whole album.  If you are already down with the head-pounding sound, you are not reading this review by this point.  Those of you in this cateGORY have already bought the CD and don't require the lecture.  Those not in this realm would do nicely to, in the very least, listen to some of the samples on this website, or on &lt;A HREF=\\"[...]\\">the official Cannibal Corpse Website.&lt;/A HREF>  I thank you for your time.
B0007GAEW6|3.0|It would not surprise me that the only single off this album is and will be 'The Widow' and even that song had to be edited down to get radio-play because the last two minutes are typical Mars Volta spaced-out noodling.  What I mean by that is that Frances the Mute's songs are more like drawn-out jam sessions, especially on the second half of the album, in contrast to De-Loused in the Comatorium, which contained more concise, smoother, more straight forward songs and catchier riffs with the occasional going-off-on-a-tangent.  There is not much cohesion in any of the songs on Frances with the exception of The Widow and L'Via L'Viaquez and that includes even Omar a Rodriguez-Lopez's solos.  This is contrast to De-Loused, where all of his solos and licks seemed to have a direction, rhythm and melody.  All in all, I would say, if you liked De-Loused, Frances the Mute is almost a complete 90 degree turn in terms of just musical composition and feel.  While it's not the most easy to listen to, it does have it's moments especially on 'Cygnus....Vismund Cygnus', 'The Widow', 'L'Via L'Viaquez' and the beginning of 'Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore', as well as the end of the album beginning with the fifth part of Cassandra Gemini, Sarcophagi, until the end, where the trumpet sounds pretty cool.
B0007O38F8|1.0|With only two or three standout tracks. This album is boring and not nearly as inventive or infectious as Get Rich or Die Trying. This is a real step back for 50. I hope this album doesn't sell. His shootemup bravado grows boring and the only \\"deep\\" song has been done before. 50 thinks he is as great as mc's like Jay-Z Biggie Nas & Tupac but pales in comparison. Enjoy your 15 minutes 50.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Many people complain about The Mars Volta because of songs they have that are mostly instrumental music, but that's what makes the album so great. The music! not just the lyrics, because we all know those are great. I love this album its just awesome, i listen to it no matter what mood I'm in. The Mars Volta is truely an amazing band. If you dont appriciate them for their music, than you dont know one thing about good music, because its not just about the hit single, people could care less about that.
B00002MZ4W|4.0|\\"Tidal\\" was an amazing debut from teen Fiona Apple, setting a high bar for her to measure up to on the dreaded \\"sophomore slump\\" album. Between \\"Tidal\\" and writing these songs, someone really broke Apple's heart...and the tension is palpable throughout the disc.<br /><br />The raw emotion vented here encompasses all out rage (\\"Limp\\"), desperation (\\"Love Ridden\\") and denial (\\"On the Bound\\"). Not only is the hurt here, but the struggle from Apple to get past it all even if means \\"rebound\\" relationships: (\\"A Mistake\\" and  and \\"Fast as You Can\\").<br /><br />Musically, the sound expands as she toys with loops and faster tempos (the aptly named \\"Fast as You Can\\"), cocktail jazz (\\"I Know\\"), Beatlesque flourishes (\\"Paper Bag\\") and guitar distortion (\\"The Way Things Are\\"). Vocally, Fiona allows herself some occasional belting that works well.<br /><br />I can't single out any tracks as needing work but my favourites are \\"Limp\\", \\"Paper Bag\\", \\"Fast as You Can\\", and \\"Love Ridden\\". Another fine outing. When's the next one coming??<br /><br />4 1/2 stars
6304457391|5.0|In the midst of the Cold War, sitting U.S. President Jordan Lyman, portrayed sterlingly by actor emeritus Frederic March has proposed a bilateral nurclear disarmament treaty in John Frankenheimer's controversial and conceivable \\"Seven Day in May\\".  March, an unpopular president with a low approval rating is seen as an idealistic dreamer.  Meanwhile General Scott head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, played by the authoritative, tough Burt Lancaster, is secretly coordinating a desert based military installation with a mission to overthrow the government.  Lancaster has widespread support among the heads of the armed forces in carrying out this plot.<br /><br />Lancaster aide Colonel \\"Jiggs\\" Casey played by the moralistic and patriotic Kirk Douglas, gets wind of this plot although being kept out of the loop.  Douglas, in a personally dangerous manuever alerts the President as to Lancaster's aspirations.  March with the aide of his senatorial and cabinet friends attempts to reveal and thwart Lancaster's plan for sedition.<br /><br />Frankenheimer's worthy follow up to \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\" proves to be an important message movie in a time of divergent ideologies.  The supporting cast consisting of solid actors including Martin Balsam and personal fave Edmond O'Brien give powerful and memorable performances.  Ava Gardner is passionate playing Lancaster's ex-mistress.  March, Douglas and Lancaster are all extraordinarily convincing in their roles.
B0006Z169S|5.0|I've bought this beautiful Delta Goodrem Maxi as an Import a while ago, as a profound Delta Fan, and say, this is one of the best Delta Goodrem Single releases I've seen and heard. Not only does one find the Tori Amos Piano Style tinged unique \\"Mistaken Identity\\" one also finds wonderful b-sides like \\"Silence Be Heard\\" and an older b-side, though very good \\"How A Dream Looks\\" song as well. As well as the beautiful unique \\"Mistaken Identity\\" as a Computer video. On this Limited Edition Australian Import one finds 2 Wonderful 2005 Calender Cards as well, with unseen pictures of Delta Goodrem - Giving this stunning Maxi a full 5 Stars and total Recommendation for any Delta Goodrem Fans out there - Thanks Delta!
B0007GAEW6|5.0|So If you want to see why I gave it 5 stars, look at the other 5 star reviews.  It's ok if you don't like this, it's ok to give it one star, but PLEASE don't call the rest of us \\"misguided\\" or anything along those lines.  I know what I like and I LOVE this.  How can you tell me I'm misguided?  That's so arrogant to think that your opinion is the \\"right\\" one.   <br /> <br />Please do not complain about how there aren't as many \\"songs\\" as there were on deloused.  This is a full length album, and it has 5 songs.  DO THE MATH!  Obviously they are going to be long.  Obviously they are going to be drawn out jams because you can't have a full album with 5 songs any other way.  You should have thought about this before you bought it if you didn't want to hear epic, sprawling prog masterpieces.   <br /> <br />I like every minute of this album.  Too early to tell If I have a preference between this and de-loused in the comatorium.  No one should have expected this album to sound anything like that- the mars volta is not the type of band to repeat what they've already done.   <br /> <br />My only expectations buying this were that it would be very different, and it would be brilliant.  I wasn't let down and you won't be either if you are open minded to hearing different song structures, lengths, and styles of music.  Incredible.   <br />Incredible.   <br />Incredible.
B0007O38F8|5.0|I'm feelin' this CD and it's fire, but it's not 'special'.  It is definitly not an instant classic like Get Rich.  But let's face it, 50 might never top Get Rich or Die Tryin'.  There are alot of albums out there that artists may never top, like Kanye's College Dropout.  It's just too difficult.  Almost every track on Get Rich or College Dropout were fire.           There are alot of good songs, but some of the songs are not lyrically strong.  The best song lyrcally is \\"A Baltimore Love Thing\\".  This brings deepness to the album and shows the harsh life of drugs and addiction.  Eminem brings some side-kick assistance in \\"GATman and Robin\\".  Also, 50's response to \\"New York\\" is expresed through \\"Piggybank\\" where he disses Jada and Fat Joe.         50 put 22 tracks into this, but some tracks barely cross the 3 minute mark.  Olivia is on two of the tracks, \\"Candyshop\\" and \\"So Amazing\\".  And even Oscar winner Jamie Foxx contributes vocals for, \\"Build You Up\\".  G Unit takes over Game's \\"Hate It or Love It\\" in the remix and Yayo and Em have a track each.    There's a lot of haters out there.  Well hate it or love it 50 Cent's on top.         This CD is definitly fire and should be in anyone's CD collection, right beside that Get Rich or Die Tryin' CD.  Go support this album and copp it.  It drops on MARCH 3rd!

B0002IVN9W|2.0|Are you are wearing a brand-new pair of distressed lo-rise Diesel jeans, a ringer t-shirt with a silly 1970s logo printed on it, and perhaps a pair of suede Pumas? This is the ideal soundtrack to match your outfit, then: bland, trendy consumer product for your \\"alternative\\" lifestyle. The shrewd critical ears at Pitchfork named this the #1 album of 2004, and I'm sure the songs are soon to appear on \\"The O.C.\\" No doubt this record's in heavy rotation right now at all the Urban Outfitters stores. Enjoy! <br /> <br />Soundwise, most of the tracks owe a big debt to Yo La Tengo (ambient guitarscapes) and Neutral Milk Hotel (string section, goofy/vulnerable lyrics). It seems a shame to compare either of those great bands to the Arcade Fire, however, except to suggest your money would be better spent on \\"Painful\\" or \\"In The Aeroplane Over the Sea\\" instead of this.
B000084T18|5.0|How does he? Well, demographers say that within fifty years, caucasians will be in the minority in \\"developed\\" western countries for the first time in human history. I suggest that, rather than cast your lot with the ignorant haters of that minority-to-be, your time would be far better spent in making your peace with the ascending multiracial culture. You can beat your head against a wall (which, frankly, I'd enjoy standing back and watching for a couple of hours) or join the real world. The choice is yours, Slappy. <br />
B0006OBPTA|4.0|I got a copy of The Karate Kid Special Edition Box Set the very second it was released. I must say I had the most enjoyable experience listening to that commentary! I was laughing so much along with the cast and crew. It was very special for me to hear Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita discussing this film 20 years after it first hit theaters and warmed it's way into our hearts. I have loved this movie for 20 years straight. I was a Ralph Macchio fanatic at 8 years of age and I still think this is such a fantastic movie. The DVD is superb. The commentary is the number one feature. It's informative, interesting, and highly entertaining. There are a few featurettes that are enjoyable as well. No deleted scenes though! And where the heck was Elisabeth Shue during the making of this? Oh well, other than that I reccommend anyone who loves this movie to pick up this new box set. As an added bonus you get the other three lesser sequels. I myself have never been a fan of any of them, but it's good to have them as part of the collection. Two huge karate kicks up! :)
B0007N1AI6|5.0|This version is much better than the DualDisc version.  Priest come back with a bang with this album.  They pick up right where Painkiller left off.  You can tell they took a page from Halford solo career (they used Roy Z, the producer for all 3 Halford albums) instead of following with the Ripper-era style.  Alotfo double-bass drumming and dueling solos make this album fit perfectly in their historic album collection.  The DVD is cool with a documentay about how the new album came to be and the set list for the DVD is rockin'.  Don't skip this, you'll be sorry
B00005JNDZ|4.0|I loved the first movie,and colin firth is handsome and sexy as ever.But it could have had more of them together laughing shagging or just being together,but there was none of that.He was just boring i had hoped once they were a couple he would open up and have a little fun or to just see him laugh.Bridget was her normal lets see what i can make a mess of this time.Renee did a wonderful job in this one as well as the first one she did gain more weight with this one and it showed but she looked wonderful.Colin Firth is just so sexy that he would look good no matter what he was playing he did a great job again as mark darcy he was just perfect.Hugh Grant was not that great he looked so much older and thinner than in the first one but mark had to kick someone's butt right.but all together it was good.I will buy it and watch it over and over just to see colin firth!!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007GAEW6|4.0|Deloused in the comatorium was near-perfect and one of the best rock albums to come out in years    Frances the mute takes off near where deloused left.  The music on this album is alittle more complicated and slightly less catchy but still very good. The only problem i have with Frances the Mute is its too short.  I mean it is a 77 minute album but it only seems like its 3 songs.  The last 7 or 8 tracks of the album seem like one 45 minute long song that doesnt change that much.  Don't get me wrong this is a very good album but it doesn't offer as many songs as deloused did.  Instead of writing several different sounding songs, they jammed dozens of different musical influences into a couple epic lenghty songs. I think mars volta took the whole concept album idea alittle too far with this one.    But yes it still is very good.  Anyone who liked deloused should like this one; especially tracks 3 and 5.

B0007MVXQG|5.0|I've been a Priest fan since \\"Sin After Sin\\" came out when I was in high school in 1977. While I didn't dislike the Ripper era Priest, I've been waiting for a new album with Rob Halford for 14 years. This cd deliveres! Even the slow songs are done masterfully, and Rob uses a different singing style on \\"Worth Fighting For\\" to great effect. But the killer songs are the reason you came, and it's here where the cd shines. \\"Demonizer\\" and \\"Hellrider\\", the stand-out tracks in my opinion, would fit on \\"Painkiller\\", with great lead guitar work from Glenn and KK, and outstanding drum work by Scott. \\"Judas Rising\\", \\"Wheels of Fire\\" and \\"Deal with the Devil\\" fit nicely into the \\"Screaming for Vengance\\" era. Rob's in great form here and the production by Roy Z is outstanding. This album is a must have by all Priest fans and heavy metal fans!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I think Michael has shown tremendous growth with this record.  It's his best yet!  The single \\"Home\\" is so fantastic, I play it over and over.  He's grown and shown much more range here, not just as a crooner of old songs, but good pop music as well.  Kudos to Michael.
B0007O38F8|5.0|I can't believe there's all these 50 haters out there.  Especially people who think that Game is better.  Look at the facts: Game has two hit records so far-\\"How We Do\\" and \\"Hate it or Love it\\"  And guess what, who does the hook on those songs?  Who does half the rap&lyrics?  In fact, if you really listen to it, Game's rhymes are the WEAKEST parts of those songs.  It sounds like he can't even count bars.  He's terrible, his rhymes are all over the place and don't even match the beats.  An 8-year old kid could come up with better rhymes than Game.  I don't think he uses more than one or two words that have more than one syllable to them.  I'm serious, Game is nothing but hype and ridiculous marketing by Dr. Dre.  And Dre has his own agenda, He wants to \\"bring the West back.\\"  So to all those 50 haters who think that Game is the real deal, go buy a dictionary and learn how to speak English better than a little 8 year old buster who can't articulate anything better than one-syllable words; Game is a joke!
B00008GKEG|5.0|Make no mistake--this is a spectacular Beatlefest for both casual fan and die-hard alike.  Every stage of their career is here, and for many, this is the one place to glimpse lots of rare footage and to understand--even better than the accompanying CDs--exactly how the Beatles worked in and out of the studio, and how their songs were made. <br /> <br />But it's also an extremely sad story.  I have been a Beatle fan since the early 1970s, bought all their albums, saw all the films, read as many books as I could get my hands on, and yet never really, fully realised how ugly and brutal their breakup really was, or how sick of the whole Beatlemania thing all four were (only Lennon was the most honest in his Rolling Stone interviews).  One clearly gets a sense of the extreme exhaustion all four members suffered when they gave up touring in 1966, and how sick of the \\"longest cocktail party\\" they had become by 1969.  Perhaps the Anthology focuses too much on uncovering the horrible, honest truth of The Beatles, but it perhaps also stands as a testimony to their collective genius that they continued to make such great music even to the end.  Watch these DVDs and prepare to see The Beatles as you've never seen them before.  They are a more comprehensive view than the overblown (and overpriced) CD sets.
B0007O38F8|5.0|I'm a Nas, Jay Z, Eminem, 50 Cent, G Unit, The Game, Dr Dre, D12, and 2 Pac fan. This are the major rappers I listen to. <br />Frankly, I think what I'm reading here is rather childish. Why, because, more than half the reviews here are simply referring to 50's beef with Jada, Nas, and Fat Joe, and hence, you're giving him 1 and 2 stars. That's rubbish. The aim of this review forum is to talk about the album. Really, not many people are doing that. And to prove it, take a look at the dates of the reviews- most range before the album's release date. What? You listen to an internet version of the album and then you come online dissing him. If you dissed him because of the songs, I would understand. Instead, it's all about, \\"Oh, look, he's mad to go against the God's son! One Star for you, Mr Cent!\\" <br />Utter rubbish. Grow up. When Nas went against the King himself- 2 Pac, no one hated him and dissed him cos of it. It was a fair and square battle. 50 and Nas have a problem. If they have to settle it through beef, so be it. I'm a fan of both artists and I'll sit, listen, and judge. If Nas is allowed to go against Jigga, 50 is allowed to go against whoever he wants. It's the way things are. <br />Now, to the album. Naturally, it's not Get rich or die trying. All eyes are on 50 Cent, hence the expectations are high. If you expect something better than In da Club or all that, then you'll be disappointed. If you are ready to listen to this album like you listen to any other album and not take it like it should be made of Gold cos it's got Eminem and Dre in it, then you'll love it. Simple. How difficult can that be? <br />I'm with you 50.
B00006879E|5.0|I got this CD this past summer after seeing them in concert and I definitely regret not getting it before then because I would have had a better appreciation for these guys. They are really awesome and their music is a bit different than the typical pop and rap music that we have now. I'm not trying to diss that music but \\"Songs About Jane\\" is definitely refreshing to have around, granted that it's been around for years now. I feel bad that it's taken Maroon 5 so long to get here because they are so talented and their music is so unique. For example, songs on this album like \\"Harder to Breathe\\", can take you to rocking out and playing air guitar one minute and then to tapping your feet and snapping your fingers the next minute with songs like \\"Sunday Morning\\" and \\"Must Get Out\\", it's that versatile.  <br /> <br />Overall, I definitely, definitely recommend getting this CD. If you haven't yet, you're probably one of the few now with all this hype on them, so get in with the cool crowd and go buy one. Enjoy!
B0007N1AI6|5.0|Seeing Judas Priest last summer at Rock Fest, I knew these guys were gonna kick more ass than ever before. Their new album Angel Of Retribution has got all the classic Priest traits including the blazing riffs, the mindblowing solos courtesy of guitarists Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing, and of course the shining vocals of returning singer Rob Halford (in his first album with the band since 1990's Painkiller).

B0007O38F8|3.0|The Pros: While I wish 50 would choose his beef more carefully (more on that later), you gotta give him credit for one thing: when he wants to do something for the streets, he commits to it. He seems to come off extra grimey on \\"In My Hood\\" and the catchy murder march \\"This Is 50\\". The gangsta music dominates the scene, but 50, like a true crossover rapper, tries to present a lil' something for everyone. For instance, the self-explanatory \\"Ryder Music\\" is perfect for a laidback evening ride. Then there's the bouncy, humorous player-made \\"Get In My Car\\", both produced by Hi-Tek. And naturally, there are an abundance of club bangers like the catchy single \\"Disco Inferno\\" (beatwise, anyway) and the Dr. Dre produced \\"Outta Control\\" (which sounds a lot like \\"Higher\\" from Game's LP) and thug-love jams like \\"Candy Shop\\", \\"Build You Up\\", and \\"So Amazing\\". More notably is the soulful and suprisingly deep \\"A Baltimore Love Thing\\". OK, so it isn't exactly revelation worthy, but 50's relationship in the song, comparing himself to heroine, is something you wouldn't expect from Mr. Guns and Roses. But before you know it, it's back to the hood with the Dre-Scott Storch laced \\"Gunz Come Out\\", some ill piano work on the hustler inspired \\"Position of Power\\" and \\"Ski Mask Way\\" (and yes, that is a Biggie line he's using). 50 also comes up with some other clever concepts like \\"My Toy Soldier\\" w/ Tony Yayo, ironically produced by Eminem. In fact, Slim produces two more quality tracks like the obviously chilling \\"I'm Supposed To Die Tonight\\" and \\"Gatman\\", the latter being a collabo track with Em playing the part of \\"Robbin\\". And even though it's predominately about gats, gangs, and girls, there's a little redemption in the nice remix to \\"Hate It Or Love It\\", where ALL of the G-Unit members lament on wax the \\"pressure and pain\\" of street life. Repetitive subject matter aside, 50 still has just enough charisma (if not lyrical prowess) to keep you focused, as well as the banging beats on almost every track. And hey, even something like \\"Piggy Bank\\" is listenable with the right hook and beats...<br /><br />The Cons:...unfortunately, that's about all I could dig about the aformentioned song. Like I said, 50 needs to watch the disses. And even though his newest track of that nature was decent, it feels like lyrical suicide. Especially considering that 50 ain't no Lloyd Banks, let alone Rakim, if you catch my drift. Or as Jadakiss said, \\"Out of your whole squad, your flow is the weakest\\". While the album was pretty good, if you strip it of all the killer production, it can get pretty repetitive pretty quick. And all of the aforementioned party jams (Candy Shop being the best lyrically), none of them are near to being the next \\"In Da Club\\". But back to \\"Piggy Bank\\" for a second. It just doesn't make sense how 50 can strike at Jada and Joe just for collaborating Ja Rule. And also like Kiss said, \\"he doesn't need 50's permission\\"! The only reason the Shyne beef got started is because he was thinking of signing to Murder Inc. And Lord knows what started Nas' issue, as he took a stab at 50 first. Still, you can't help thinking that while listening to the songs, you know that all four of those New Yorkers would smoke him (NOT LITERALLY! Besides, you know that wouldn't work!). Other than that, the guntalk gets kinda old. And how many love songs can a guy make for one record? I ain't contradicting what I said earlier because Ja Rule's got the same problem.<br /><br />Bottom Line: In some ways, better and worse than \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\". Now that the hype is over, it ain't going 10x platinum, I can tell you that. But still a decent album, with banging beats and inspired collabos galore. Perfect for a gangsta party (OK, bad joke).<br />------------------------7.5 out of 10---------------------------<br />Best Songs:<br />-\\"This Is 50\\"<br />-\\"Gatman and Robbin\\"<br />-\\"Hate It Or Love It (Remix)\\"<br />-\\"My Toy Soldier\\"<br />-\\"A Baltimore Love Thing\\"<br />-\\"Ski Mask Way\\"
B0007N1AI6|5.0|I've been a Priest fan since \\"Sin After Sin\\" came out when I was in high school in 1977. While I didn't dislike the Ripper era Priest, I've been waiting for a new album with Rob Halford for 14 years. This cd deliveres! Even the slow songs are done masterfully, and Rob uses a different singing style on \\"Worth Fighting For\\" to great effect. But the killer songs are the reason you came, and it's here where the cd shines. \\"Demonizer\\" and \\"Hellrider\\", the stand-out tracks in my opinion, would fit on \\"Painkiller\\", with great lead guitar work from Glenn and KK, and outstanding drum work by Scott. \\"Judas Rising\\", \\"Wheels of Fire\\" and \\"Deal with the Devil\\" fit nicely into the \\"Screaming for Vengance\\" era. Rob's in great form here and the production by Roy Z is outstanding. This album is a must have by all Priest fans and heavy metal fans!
B0007O38F8|3.0|Awwwww man Damn i just wasted $18 bucks. money i should have spent on white tees damnnnnnnn there are only 5 good songs on the album. A lil bit, Candy shop, disco inferno, In my hood, Gatman and Robbin pheeeww Eminem saved that one. 50 sounds like he didnt take this project serious, he probably thought he could make a classic because of his status. You can tell he made the decisions of the album making on his own. He definately needed a lot more guidance from Dr.Dre like THE GAMES album had, i mean it is only his second album. He is definately a victim of the sophmore jinx. THE GAMES ALBUM IS DEFINATELY BETTER.  But I definitely will keep the cd in my player though just because of those 5 songs. Cant wait till Jadakiss airs his ass out neither.
0804115613|4.0|After many years of sitting on my shelf I decided to finally pick this book up.  I was not disappointed.  It is filled with sweet vignettes about a quaint southern town.  Only the more you read the more you discover the town isn't so quaint.  But it does resonate as real.  I enjoyed the book very much and am looking forward to more books by Fanny Flagg.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|It would have been easy for these guys to release \\"Painkiller Part Deux\\" for their reunion, but they made something more appropriate for the occasion.  Although there are elements of Painkiller in there, there is a definite Classic Priest component on Angel Of Retribution.  From the break-neck double bass drumming of \\"Demonizer,\\" to the understated and darkly elegant \\"Eulogy,\\" this album rocks.  The best songs for me are the tense \\"Judas Rising,\\" \\"Worth Fighting For\\" (an instant classic reminiscent of \\"Desert Plains\\"), and \\"Eulogy.\\"  For us long-time Priest fans, this album hits the spot!  As for those who don't like it, they're not really Priest fans.  This album isn't what I expected - it's actually better.
B0007NFL18|1.0|LISTEN UP PEOPLE!!!!!  <br /> <br />This entire week you can go to MTV.com and preview the ENTIRE cd on \\"the Leak\\". I implore you to do so. This cd is weak AT BEST! The tracks \\"I'm Supposed To Live Tonight\\", \\"Disco Inferno\\", and \\"Hate It Or Love It(G Unit Remix)\\" are the only songs that you might want to hear more than once. I'm not a hater of 50 cent. I believe he's talented artist, but this cd was just a waste of his time and, if you purchase it, your money.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind was originally released under the title &quot;Warriors Of The Wind&quot;, which was an old english dub released onto our shores about 20 years ago. There were those of us who enjoyed the old dub (Myself as a kid), while others thought it ruined Hayao Miyazaki's beautiful title. Now, after 20 years, the UNCUT version is now available on DVD, with a new english dub cast (Listened to the dub myself, very well done), and japanese with subtitle format.<br />The animation, even after all this time, is masterfully restored, and I didn't see any signs of grains or animation errors or glitches on the DVD. Even today, the animation stands out from other Computer Generated anime titles. There is so much detail put into this movie, you can't help but feel you're watching what some anime should titles should be.<br />The story makes more sense and flows better in this uncut edition, as we see details that were missed in the old dub release.<br />The music also remains very well intact, and I still remember it vividly in my mind.<br />Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind is a TRUE anime at heart. This is Hayao Miyazaki's masterpiece, and should NOT be missed by ANY fan of japanese anime, those who like a good story, or those who would love to rekindle old memories. Get this, you WON'T regret it.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|this redefines packaged rock music.  countless bands before the mars volta have written continuous albums with noise from beginning to end, but never before have i heard it bridged like this.  it's truly orchestral, not just in the occasional non-traditional instrumentation, not just in the contiguity of the movements, but in the compositional structure, in the scope of the project, in its range of dynamics and styles.  in de-loused, you could pick apart all the different styles they were blending ... you could hear the rock, the latin, the funk, the jazz, the ambient ... in frances, it's impossible to really tell where one begins and one ends.  very little of it is catchy, but there's a lot more to music than catchiness.  just as zeppelin's kashmir will never die, i can hear songs like l'via l'viaquez playing when i'm 45.
B0007O38F8|4.0|Ok.  First of all the lyrical content isn't ever great.  You're never like \\"listen to that cold a-- flow\\".  So, lets be realistic.  This is a good 50 cent CD.  It's different and good, it is what I expected from 50.  Your expectations must be completely off base.  What did you expect? Something like jay-z. nas, or jadakiss. No.  You got exactly what 50 does on all of his CD's and features, a slow non-complicated flow with catchy a-- hooks. <br />Don't let these new conflicts and issues affect your judgement. Buy the CD, it's really a quality joint.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|Back in the 60's and early 70's I became a devoted fan of Bob Dylan.  His music was excellent but it was his lyrics that seemed to reach deep within me.  I remember the summer of 1972 when I was living in a strange town and hardly knew a soul.  It was a depressing experience and I coped by a daily regimen of Bob Dylan.  I had his first six albums and kept playing them over and over.  The earlier albums were folk music with a lot of social consciousness in them.  However, the one that really got to me was \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\".  Some claimed that Dylan \\"sold out\\" the folk music scene by going electric.  What he actually did was to take his music to a higher level.   <br /> <br />The collection of songs covers the folk music style as well as blues and rock and roll.  The musicians that he picked, including Michael Bllomfield and Al Kooper bring a sort of jazzy rock sound to most of the cuts.  However, the lyrics are ALL Dylan.  I confess that I gave up trying to understand the meaning of much of what he says in these songs.  For many songs, the lyrics are like an abstract painting in words.  Yet even in the midst of abstraction, there are some beautiful and/or inspiring lyrics. <br /> <br />My favorite cuts include \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\".  I'm afraid to say I may have aged into the subject of that song but it still reminds me of what it used to be like to be on the other side of the \\"generation gap\\".  Another is \\"The Tombstone Blues\\".  I have always enjoyed the lyrics; \\"I wish I could give brother Bill his great thrill.  I'd set him in chains on the top of the hill.  Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. Demille.  He could die happily ever after.\\"  Another of my favorite cuts is \\"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry\\".  It is an easy-going bluesy song and I like the lyrics, \\"I want to be your lover Baby, I don't want to be your boss.  Don't say I never warned you, when your train gets lost.\\".  There are many more good songs but, for me, the best cutis \\"Desolation Row\\".  This song is about 10 minutes long and I still wish it would go on and on.  The guitar playing in that song is spell-binding and Dylan again shows that no one can play the harmonica like he can.  This image of Armaggedon is one that has haunted me ever since the first time I heard it.  \\"I got your letter yesterday, about the time the doorknob broke.  When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke...\\"  That song had the uncanny ability to elevate depression to an art form.  It elevates me every time I hear it.   <br /> <br />There have been lots of great albums over the years.  For many of them, the songs lose a bit of their luster from repeated play.  \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" reveals more and more about itself each time you listen to it.
B0000057C5|1.0|what the hell is this? i remember a guy i know saying 'theres a crazy band called rammstein and they do the heaviest song ive ever heard!' forgetting that the guy's main genre of music is classic rock like jimmy hendrix, i got a little excited. so i said, what? and he said, 'theyre called rammstein, but they dont speak english.' like i gave a flying sh t, because you cant understand what any of the other bands i listen to are saying, so it floated in my mind for a little while. i wondered why i hadnt heard of this rammstein band before, until i realised about 50-60% of people i know like them. i then realized that they were a popular band. i dont listen to popular bands. again, sticking that in the back of my mind, i found myself going to the music store and buying a cd with a sticker 2 for 25 on it. i said, 'i should save myself a couple bucks and get another one thats got this sticker on it.' i then saw rammstein's cd with the face of a corpse in some kind of face gripping devise on it, and i remembered what i had heard that while ago. <br />long story short (too late) i bought the cd and popped it in, anticipating something mind-blowing. hehehehehe...i was SO wrong. this is techno with distorted guitars in the background. and then i got to track 5, du hast. the song that was 'so heavy'. i was amazed at how this song could be so popular, let alone the band. the whole thing is terrible. unlistenable. terrible. stupid. take your pick, ive got millions of other adjectives. <br />do yourself a favor, and avoid this album. in fact, avoid the band. this is stupid. this band is one steo up from listening to blink-182. do NOT get this album. in fact, burn it if you have it already.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This was the first CD of Green Day's that I've ever owned, and it's initiated my current obsession with them. After receiving 'American Idiot' as a birthday gift, I've purchased 'Dookie', 'Insomniac', 'Nimrod', 'Warning', and 'International Superhits'. I'm still missing their first two albums (which weren't major label releases) and their collection of B-Sides. Those three are first on my \\"wishlist\\" and I'm hoping to buy them as soon as I can come up with the money. But back to the album; I definitely hear a huge difference between their earlier releases and 'American Idiot'. Though I don't prefer it to 'Nimrod', it's definitely better than 'Warning'. It could arguably be considered better than 'Dookie' or 'Insomniac', depending on whether the listener prefers a more punk sound or a more rock sound. No matter whether you prefer old Green Day or \\"new\\" Green Day, this is not an album to be missed.    'American Idiot' begins with the title track, which was the first single to drop from the album. The song was overplayed where I am, but I'm still not sick of it (amazing!). The lyrics include some smart plays on words, and could offend some people, but shouldn't. They're basically calling out the fact that America has been living in a constant state of fear and is being \\"controlled by the media\\". It clearly bashes George W. Bush, but never actually calls him out. Both subtle and brash, this is an amazing track. The second track is the first of the two nine minute songs on the album. Within both of these rock operas are five smaller songs. The first here is 'Jesus of Suburbia'. This one has a good beat and strong lyrics. I didn't like it immediately, but it's become one of my favourites off of the album. It merges seamlessly into 'City of the Damned' the vocals slow down a bit, but it's definitely not a slow track. Billie Joe sounds rather sad, which makes sense as the lyrics are somewhat depressing. Things speed up again with 'I Don't Care'. At the beginning of this mini-song, the vocals are quite drawn out before jumping into angry yelling. 'Dearly Beloved' comes in smoothly thanks to Tre Cool switching his drumming from loud pounding, to softer, more rhythmic beats. I also really like the bass (thanks to Mike Dirnt) at the beginning. This is one of the catchiest mini-songs from the rock operas. It could have been cheesy, but the guys managed to pull it off and it sounds amazing. 'Tales From Another Broken Home' finishes off the first nine minute tracks from 'American Idiot' beautifully. it's not too fast or slow, the lyrics are awesome, and all the vocals (lead and back-up) are amazing. Nearing the end it slows down, before speeding up right at the end for an amazing finish.     'Holiday' is the most upbeat song off of the album and the third single to drop from it. This is probably my favourite song from 'American Idiot'. The lyrics are flawless, as are the vocals and instrument arrangements. I really like Tre's drums right after the chorus begins to fade away and he picks the pace up again. After about two minutes and 25 seconds or so, the song is interrupted with a little yelling rant from Billie Joe, with some vocal help from Tre and Mike. The music video for this single is also visually stunning. It was like the guys tried to jam as much stuff as they could into one four minute clip. If that isn't enough to make you want to see it, seeing Tre dressed as a woman and a priest should hopefully persuade you. Back to the album, 'Holiday' merges flawlessly into 'Boulevard of Broken Dreams', which was basically the song that wouldn't go away. Thankfully, even though this track was ridiculously overplayed, I'm still not sick of it. At the beginning of the song you can hear vocal echoes in the background if you listen closely. This is a good song, but not an amazing masterpiece. I think the reason it was so overplayed was because basically everyone likes it. It's not age, gender, race, or whatever specific, so it appeals to a mass audience. Rather than speeding up after a mid-tempo track, the album actually slows down even more with 'Are We The Waiting'. It begins with slow, sort of all-over-the-place drums before the guitar, bass, and vocals come in. I really like the heart wrenching lyrics, and the chorus seems anthem-like with Billie Joe, Tre, and Mike all singing together as though they're yelling from a distance.     I'd definitely say that 'St. Jimmy' is the most \\"punk\\" song on the album. The intro is awesome, with a great build up before the vocals really start. The beat is also one of the best on the album. I dare anyone to listen to the song all the way through and still not be tapping their feet along by the end. After about two minutes, the rhythm changes quite significantly, but still subtly before the song finishes off with a bang. 'Give Me Novacaine' (yes, it's spelt \\"novacaine\\" on the album, not \\"novocain\\") has quickly become a favourite among those who own the album. It slows down quite dramatically after 'St. Jimmy', but it's not a ballad, it's a mid-tempo track. There are some great riffs on this song, coupled with strong vocals and somewhat repetitive (but not in a bad way) lyrics. All in all, this is definitely a standout track. 'American Idiot' speeds up once more with another \\"punk\\" influenced track, 'She's A Rebel'. It's still a far cry from Green Day's older work though, with much more mature harmonies which would be extremely out of place on an album like 'Dookie'. The lyrics also refer to the album's cover art, when Billie Joe sings that the girl in the song is \\"holding on my heart like a hand grenade\\".     Turning around and taking a different spin, 'Extraordinary Girl' is probably the most pop-influenced track on the CD. In fact, it would fit in quite well on 'Warning'. This is a good song which I really enjoy, but I'd still say it's probably the weakest point in the album. Not because it's bad, but because it doesn't fit in well enough with the album's overall theme, the production was off on this one. 'Letterbomb' begins with an amateur recording of a girl singing \\"Nobody likes you/Everyone left you/They're all out without you/Having fun\\" (which we'll also hear later in the album) before the music starts. This is a catchy song with strong lyrics, but nothing too outstanding. However, the chorus is quite strong, and almost too appealing, as I always seem to get it stuck in my head. The guys certainly do know how to write catchy hooks, that's for sure. 'Wake Me Up When September Ends' is a ballad and the slowest song on the album. It begins with just a soft acoustic guitar and vocals from Billie Joe. The lyrics are obviously very personal, but can still be interpreted differently by different listeners. The song speeds up after about a minute and 30 seconds with the use of more instruments. I absolutely love the sad/sweet lyrics; \\"Here comes the rain again/Falling from the stars/Drenched in my pain again/Becoming who we are\\".     Coming to the second of the nine minute tracks, this one consists of five \\"mini-songs\\" as well. First is 'The Death of St. Jimmy'. It begins with just an electric guitar and vocals before some heavy foot-stomping speeds the track up and merges the bass and drums in. This is an awesome, catchy track. It's hard to pinpoint exactly where 'East 12th St.' begins. Some questions are asked at the beginning before really starting into the mini-song, which experiments with different rhythms. In 'Nobody Likes You' we hear the lyrics which began 'Letterbomb' reemerge. The lyrics to this track were written by Mike, and they're very catchy, this is one of my favourite points in 'American Idiot'. The mini-song begins with church-bells and is sung in an almost frightening rhythmic tone. The drums are awesome, reminding me of soldiers marching into battle. 'Rock And Roll Girlfriend' was written by Tre, and it makes me laugh. There's a trumpet, but it doesn't sound out of place, and I'm sure many people wouldn't even notice a change if they weren't listening for it. It basically consists of yelling vocals trying to get someone to \\"get off of my case\\". Closing off the nine minute epic is 'We're Coming Home Again'. The beat is really awesome on this one. It's very catchy, and the lyrics are simple and repetitive. The vocals and harmonies are drawn out and suit the music perfectly, which makes the song flawless. The drums and background vocals really build up action nearing the end before slowing down once more to finish off the song. 'Whatsername' is the last track. It's a sweet, mid-tempo track, and one of my favourites. It has mass appeal as it's simple, but well-done. It deals with memories and regrets, and is perfect because it's not overly sugar-coated or weepy. My favourite part would be with the lyrics; \\"I made a point to burn all of the photographs\\". There are a few great riffs which are much louder and angrier than the rest of the track, but don't sound out of place at all. Billie Joe's vocals really speed up at those points and sound amazing.    I'd definitely say that everyone out there needs this record. There's no question that this was the best mainstream album released in 2004. It received Rock Album of the Year at the Grammys, and should have won Album of the Year as well. If you're a fan of Green Day, this is different from their previous releases, but not in a bad way. They're growing up, and they're moving in a fantastic direction. This is more rock than any of their older work, but it works well for them. Their brave approach to this album shows not only that they love music, but that they actually know what they're doing. If you don't own 'American Idiot' go out and buy it now. There's no doubt in my mind that everyone should have this album.    THE FINAL VERDICT: 99%
B0007O38F8|1.0|First of all I want to get across how full of S#it 50cent is. He talks so much about how many albums he has sold...ask him again after they count his sales on this one! He is not even in the same category of rap as Dr.Dre and Eminem. He needs to shut his mouth and go back to selling crack! Cause that is what he's smoking! <br /> <br />Enough about that! This album sucks and if I were you I would spend 15 dollars on toilet paper than this!
B0007O38F8|5.0|All you haters just can't give him props for a great album....piggy bank, disco inferno,are some of the great joints from 50.  You say the game is better...if it weren't for 50 then you wouldn't have even heard of the game....50 is by far better and knows how to produce a cd!!!!I give you props 50
B00005JMYI|4.0|There's not much I can add about the story of this film that hasn't already been told. The movie is based on actual events. It tells a parodic version of the times when female newscasters were brought to the TV stations. Will Ferrell is to die for - while his character displays a stupid male chauvinist, he is very likable. Great DVD features - some deleted scenes, and extended parts of scenes that made it, had me laughing louder than I'd heard anyone laugh before. The end of the movie seemed a bit too easily \\"rounded off\\" to me though. I liked the jokes in the first half better, but that's just me. On the whole this is a funny film that you can watch more than once. Obviously people involved in the production KNEW that this wasn't going to be a worldwide HIT ...it's not as mainstream a movie as Lord of The Rings ;) ...but despite the sillyness of Anchorman, I think it craves a more mature audience than most Will Ferrell movies of the past. <br />Incidentally, I sometimes get the feeling that people give reviews \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\" votes based on whether they agree with the amount of stars that the reviewer has given a certain product. It is a personal question, but it still reads \\"was this review HELPFUL to you?\\" T O'brien's review, for example, tells insightful facts about the movie and the story, and should logically be helpful to anyone, whether they agree that the movie is good or not.

B000002H2H|5.0|If there are battered CDs weathered through regular constant playing in my CD player over the years, its THIS CD and Master of Puppets.  Ride the Lightning was four years old when I got it, and it still holds up in terms of feel, dynamics and musical complexity not to mention, raw and heavy.   <br /> <br />Of course, newbies, doesnt have an idea how this CD become a masterpiece in the first place.  It was so AHEAD OF ITS TIME in 1984.  On an albumwise perspective, this was a big step for a sophomore album from their firebomb Kill Em ALL.  The first was all speed one sound. RTL shifted songwriting many levels higher, with musical dynamics and melodies. It was written when Cliff Burton and Kirk Hammett came into the group.  Kill Em ALL was primarily written by Hetfield, Ulrich and Mustaine from 1981-82.  There was a remarkedly big difference there.  <br /> <br />Cliff Burton had classical music training and influenced Hetfield and Ulrich to incorporate dynamics and melodies into a seemingly linear form of music they pioneered.  Almost every song in the album was a milestone.  No one, during that time, has done what they have innocently written.  Thats classical genius.  Early on you can feel there was something about this band destined for greatness, loyal fans know that.  <br /> <br />Bar none, much of the musical metal templates you hear today came from this seminal album.   <br /> <br />On a guitar player/musician's perspective, the album was innovative. Its the first metal album with an acoustic intro before shifting into armageddon feel of the first track (Fight Fire With Fire).  It featured the dynamic high note lead bar intro from the title track courtesy of Mustaine (Ride The Lightning).   It featured the first ever song that has a bass driven solo focusing more on dynamic songwriting and seamlessly gelled with thematic and universal lyrics (For Whom The Bell Tolls).   <br />Its definitely the first album that featured the first metal ballad (Fade To Black) ina speed metal album that got the band a lot of flak early in controversy for selling out and the suicide lyrics. IT IS STILL the FIRST METAL BALLAD in the genre they pioneered that everyone copied.  It has a word-less chorus subsitituted by big firebomb guitars, and has the last section executed with arpeggiated Hammett solo that entered somewhere in the main riff and has the eerie feel of departing. I never thought a metal song can strike a nerve emotionally on this one.  Classic! <br />Trapped Under Ice was one of the supposedly \\"fillers\\" done.  The mind blowing thing about this song.  It has some thrashy feel, yet has some wild dynamic arrangments, yet it was also written in less than two hours.. considered being a filler due to constraints budget in studio time at Sweet Silence in Denmark.  <br />Creeping Death, obviously captured the classic Metallica power, nuff said, its the story of 10 plagues of Egypt in the book of Exodus. Where in the angel of death creeps in to kill the first born son of those without the cross painted with blood on their doorpost. <br />Escape... not very popular within the band but it showcased where they were heading. <br />Inspired from H.P. Lovecraft's Khutulus Mythos and the Lochness monster (has its derivative in The Thing That Should Not Be), the dynamic 9 minute instrumental (The Call of Ktulu), all downpicked riffs, has Cliff's Bass solo, then moving to the longest solo ever by Kirk Hammett, you have to commend Kirk for executing those solos with almost 80 percent improvisation, section in different scales.  Thats how he approached it, truly an intuitive musician.  <br />Overall, there are songs that may feel to sound boring at first, but the charm of this album make you so disturbed and you'd want to play it again and again and get addicted... shifting your interest to EACH ONE of the songs in this album. Same was true for Master of Puppets, no left overs.   <br /> <br />Metallica had everyone feeling so good that time, theybecame posterboys for aggression that it pissed a great number of them when they got big progressed with their nineties albums.  <br /> <br />This album has that cultish vibe when their popularity increased in the Bay Area and Europe. An album chockfull of riffs, it has the raw, eerie feel of death and dying as the album theme, the imperfect high pitched Hetfield vocals, great massive sound thorughout.   <br /> <br />Great guitar sound considering they lost almost ALL their equipment on tour when they started recorded this album in Denmark. Inspired by a lot of depression and loneliness brought about by loss of gear and homesickness, they created another sound that cemented a template sound for thousands of band to copy all over the years.  <br /> <br />Ride The Lightning has it all.  The feeling, vibe, sound, rawness complexity and heaviness. and nothing of the glam and pretentious stuff stereotyped to heavy metal. What more could you ask for?
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I thought there was no way Mars Volta could match their first LP \\"De-loused in the Comatorium\\", but they certainly do with \\"Frances the Mute\\". The entire piece is brilliant, from the album artwork to the music. In my opinion, this album is just as good as \\"De-loused\\" but in a more advanced way. While some say the album seems more loose than \\"De-loused\\", I feel that the guitar work is much more structured than on \\"De-loused\\". \\"De-loused\\" had a lot of (what seemed like) random notes being struck layed over with 379 effect pedals. Although it made fantastic noise, it did seem a little unstructured and out of key...On \\"Frances the Mute\\" there is plenty of unstructured \\"out of key\\" madness(it's the Mars Volta, what do you expect? But don't you love it? :-) ), but a lot more seems to use actual latin or jazz scales and it sounds like Omar's playing and composing have improved ten fold. I'll agree with those who say the songs may drag on at times, but if you are a Mars Volta fan, that is expected. Silence and noise is as much a part of the music as the melodys are, learn to appreciate it. After all, \\"silence is never misquoted, just misinterpreted\\". I could go on for hours about how fantastic this CD is, but I'll get straight to my point and end this review by saying - BUY THIS CD! NOW! THIS IS THE FUTURE. IT IS HERE. EXPAND YOUR MIND AND PREPARE.
B0007O38F8|5.0|Dear Fellow Customers:       At first, people will say he can't top Get Rich or Die tryin' But he did. People say that his production was whack but hold up where was Dre. I aint going to hate on Dre but his primary thing was The Game, he just put 50's album on the back burner. So What should a (...) do? Well he gets other people to produce beats for him and he chose very good beats. Another problem other people say that is wrong. He is not a lyricist people there are few lyricist out there. He is a rapper there is a difference. 50 had the mentality of the block to make money u take money. A rapper is way different from a lyricist so therefore dun get at him on that perspective. What he has a monopoly on? Its his hooks. They are first class. Now the album shows another side of 50, not the gangster that wanted to kill everybody but a loving ganster that loves to party. you will get the drift. This album shows that he is evolving as a rapper. Everybody got that sophmore jinx it happens but it will get airplay cuz you know what he is 50. For all y'all haters including Jadakiss, Ja Rule and FAt Joe and Nas. Get ur facts straight and dun be dissing negas that u think doesn't listen to underground music y'all (...) are so stupid to do that but its ur (...) that on the line.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|To get to the bottom of this debate, we must first examine other teen comedies.  What are they about?  Ever since \\"Something About Mary\\" and \\"American Pie\\" they have been about stupid dog tricks and inseminating pastries.  They are all wall-to-wall cliched sex jokes.  Now we get to \\"Napolean Dynamite\\".  What we have here is a comedy with no vulgarity that is hilarious, fresh and one of a kind.  Are the characters losers?  Probably.  Is there a plot?  No.  But the film's pointlessness adds to its humor.  Watch it with an open mind and see for yourself.
B0007O38F8|5.0|50 is back...yes it is no \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\" but it is still great!!!  He didn't even have Dre working on anything but 2 songs on the album, which goes to show how talented 50 is.
B0000584V3|5.0|What we have here, my friends, is a work of genius.  These fellows' abilities match those of avid classical musicians I have heard.  Each song is a unique piece of art; the song structures vary, the song lengths vary, the styles vary.  It is heavy, beautiful and unique.  This is the very musical portrait of bleakness in one of its many forms; listening to this conjures up images of the ancient houses featured on so many of their album covers.  You can practically smell the must!   <br /> <br />Sadly, I don't especially care for tracks five and six as much as the rest, but that can easily be forgiven.  I have heard four of the songs on Deliverance, and shockingly I like them even more...a review for certain when I finish listening to it.
B00000IOSU|5.0|I am appalled by the number of `true fans' dissing (there is no other word for it) this album.  <br /> <br />Too live...some complain. Now, pardon me, but does it not say `live' in ALL the product descriptions? If you don't like live, don't like fans in the background, then don't buy the dang cd and stop complaining. <br /> <br />How can Sarah swear? some wonder. Well, she's done it before, people. And I'm sorry, but you can't say that she shouldn't. She can, she does, and she will-and, you know what? She has every right to do so. It's not a perfect, clean, tidy, fundamentalist world, children. Get used to it. <br /> <br />And the fact that their re-releases? That should be obvious from the track listings on the back. If you don't want `em, don't buy `em. You say Sarah's wasting our money...who, may I ask, bought the cd? <br /> <br />Sarah McLachlan is the most amazing artist this world has or ever will see. If you don't want the cd, don't buy it and stop complaining.
B00028HBKM|1.0|This is a great movie IF you want to waste a few hours of your day and $15-20!
0380820846|4.0|The story of Colin Bridgerton and Penelope Featherington. This was undoubtedly one of the oddest, but sweetest, romances I have read in some time. The heroine is not particularly engaging. Infact, she's terribly ordinary. At least that's what you see at first. And that's what Colin has been seeing for 11 years. Their love does not bloom spontaneously- no lightening bolts. It simply starts as a smile and slowly builds into what we all know as undying love. *sigh* Applause for Julia Quinn! She took the formulaic romance and turned it on its ear, appealing to the wallflower in all of us.
020530902X|5.0|I agree with several other reviewers here that the third edition is a little better than this new one. The 3rd is the last to be edited by E. B. White himself. The 4th has been \\"updated\\" with some new examples and advice, in a misguided attempt to remove nonexistent \\"sexist\\" language, which the anonymous new editor foolishly imagines has ruined previous editions. Most of the new examples, however, are inferior and some of the new advice too PC for my taste. (That wonderful passage from Jean Stafford's short story is gone, now replaced by an insipid contemporary piece that won't risk offending Irish alcoholics.)<br /><br />This is still a great book, overall, but I prefer the older version, so I will hang on to my tattered, trustworthy old copy of the 3rd edition. When it finally falls apart, I will look for another copy in a secondhand shop.
B00001QEE8|5.0|Everything about this Jungle Book is beautiful. As a kid I was especially drawn to the music and liveliness. But the whole movie is just grand! Please check the colours, moving images, the voices, the soundeffects, the characters, the songs, the in-between music, the (sometimes harsh) humour... Whenever you feel low-down or beaten, just try to sing Bare Necessities or even better, I Wan'na Be Like You (and scat along). You'll be okay in a second.
