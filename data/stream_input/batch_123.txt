B000002INR|5.0|Out of my collection of Metal Cd's from Savatage to Iron Maiden to Kiss to just about everything this album Skid Row is my favorite. I think it's a great CD and it has many great songs. In my opinion this is the best 80's Metal album ever and like many people say you don't have to be a fan of 80's Metal to like this album you will most likley like it anyway taht's how good it is. Usually when you buy a cd theres a few bad songs and a few good songs but on this album I have to say I was satisfied with every single song. I have to say that the best 3 songs on the album are &quot;I Remember You&quot;, &quot;Youth Gone Wild&quot;, and &quot;18 And Life&quot; but I have to say taht every song is great and this album is a classic pick it up.
B00000IPAX|1.0|i first bought this album when it was first released, and i thought it was alright.  I enjoyed dude ranch, and thought it would be as good.  but then mtv started to play there song 20 times a day, and for some reason these guys became huge pop stars.  They were punk, but they have gone they way off other sell-outs.  I was sad to see them play with bad religion on tour, although br blows right now, i felt sorry for them playing in front of screaming tennie-booper fans. i thought this album might have been good, becuase they got travis from the aquabats, but i guess a drummer from a ska band couldnt put an ska in put here. i mean ska had its chance a couple years ago.  This album is the reason so many &quot;punk&quot; bands are mainstream now.  when blinks next album comes up, and fails i hope they can realize that its not about singles and mtv, its about quality. listen to these bands for real punk-rancid, pennywise, nofx, dropkick murphys, anti-flag, the clash, dead kennedys, and less than jake
B00000IJPU|5.0|It doesn't get any better than this all of the best Maiden songs on one album. This is a perfect cd for all of you that are new to Maiden. It is a great album. Only thing is I think that &quot;Afraid To Shoot Strangers&quot; should be on this album but it's still a great album with out it. In my opinion I think that the best songs on the album are &quot;Be Quick Or Be Dead&quot;, &quot;The Trooper&quot;, &quot;Wasted Years&quot;, &quot;The Clairvoyant&quot;, and &quot;Hallowed Be THy Name&quot;. Every song is good though. This is definetly worth picking up if you are new to Maiden or just to add to any Heavy Metal Collection.<br /> - Stay Heavy
B00004U2HK|5.0|When I first watched this movie, I was so impressed with Julie Andrews' voice that I sang all the songs at school to whomever would listen to me and then asked them whether or not I, too, sounded like Julie Andrews! My unimpressed classmates did not deter me from swooning at this movie every time I watch it. Watching this movie never disappoints me, and gives me a cheerful spirit especially during the holidays when our local stations put it on to keep the small fry settled after Christmas meal.  Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews' &quot;pas de deux&quot; scene is so romantic. Because this story is based on a real live woman of God makes Maria Von Trapp even more inspiring. The scenes of Austria and the mountains are wonderful, the music is inspired, and the interactions Maria has with her religious superiors refreshingly true. The evil that is symbolized by the Nazi atmosphere is neutralized by Maria's goodness, and brings to fruition the family's successful escape from Austria. One can also see how the Captain's haughty attitude (as reflected in part by his ton-y artistic friend and his fiancee, played by Eleanor Parker) melts under the simplicity and candor that is Maria. The  Captain's duty to his call to arms (to an evil Fuhrer) naturally yields to the stronger call to love of Maria and for his family. This, to me, gives depth to this movie that seems to have no real peer in the genre. The acting is superb, the sets are gorgeous and the musical scenes are charming.  It is Julie Andrews'and Christopher Plummer's most memorable work and it needs to be always included in the classics of all time.
B0000026UV|5.0|Ten years ago, I won this CD in a radioshow. I remember being disappointed when I got the CD, since I am not a Country and Western nor a guitar music lover. But I can assure you that I have not been disappointed long. I regularly play this CD when I need some non-distracting background music while working.
B00000JLX0|5.0|I just watched Titanic again this past week.  I never saw the film in a theatre, but the first time I saw it I was struck by the movie's scale and grandeur. The acting is great.  I never found myself sitting there saying &quot;Oh, come on, I could do better than that.&quot;  Far from it, I could not ever match the talent displayed here.  Kate Winslet is so beautiful in many ways, from the obvious exterior to her winning personality that shines onscreen.  I have heard so many complaints about Leonardo DiCaprio, lame jokes made about his name, mocking a person who is surely not deserving of such treatment.  He acts his part so well, Jack's love for Rose may as well have been real for all we know. As to that, I wish everyone had love like these two characters do.  The scripting is tight and seamless, you get a true sense of the love, the greed, the confidence and the despair of those on board the Titanic.  Many scenes are heartwarming, as is mentioned by other reviewers here at Amazon; several are dark and moody; suspense later, with a universal fear of being drowned exuded by the emotion and cinematography in the later portion of the film. Humor, love, good and evil, class conflicts, all these and more shown perfectly.  Titanic is a film I never thought I would like; I will watch this movie every six months or so when I get my own copy.  I highly recommend it.
6303022901|4.0|This is a fantastic movie and one filled with joy and heart breaking events. Do not let the slow start fool you. I am not usually into dramas and it is rare that i can sit through one that starts off slower than usual. This is not a action film or one filled with comedy, its true power lies in the carefully crafted transition from modern time to the pasts of these wonderful female asian characters. The words here are so important as well as the narrators voice and tone that you find yourself hanging on to the even the smallest details mentioned. <br />Even if you have studied Asian history and events in the past or now, this movie has a gripping way of holding your attention and leaving you hoping for more. Nothing can prepare you for the inner stories such as these.<br />Give this movie a chance even if you don't like dramas, but be warned, grab a tissue before you sit down.
B000003AEB|5.0|This is one of the best cds i have if not the best. This cd is a classic and if u dont have it get it; it's just off tha hook. DOGG POUND GANGSTAS
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin park is a great band, and this is a great cd.  Theres a good mixture of hard guitar and turntables to go with the rock and rap singing.  The best song on the cd by far is I tried so hard ( it might be called it doesn't even matter, im not totally sure), but the the cd is one that you can play from the beginning to the end without forcing yourself to tollerate any of the tracks.  Id definitely pick this cd up.
0380788624|3.0|This ambitious novel starts out as a totally gripping story, but slows markedly towards the end.  The politics become tedious, the portrayal of the NSA as evil is naive, and Randy Waterhouse's growing adolescent preoccupation with sex is annoying.  On the positive side, it is a deft interweaving of a historical novel and techno-thriller, knitting together a multi-generational set of characters into a combination of coincidence worthy of Wodehouse.  <br />Aside from the overt political agenda, the technical foundations are accurate and the idea of a third-world country hosting a data refuge is totally credible.  The depiction of the social ramifications and technical underpinnings of such a facility are believable, but what could have been a profound commentary on the cyclical nature of history degenerates into something of an indulgence for sexually unsatisfied nerds.  <br />Taking &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; on an extended out of town trip with some extra reading time, I was completely sucked into the story for the first week--I didn't want to stop reading. Stephenson crafts a wonderful turn of the phrase, and I came close to underlining passages (my ultimate measure of 5-star books). By the third week, I was struggling to finish.  Either the author ran out of clever allusions, or I was no longer in the mood to be entertained in that way.  I found myself highly interested in the fate of the historical characters, but the contemporary characters are shallower, and I stopped caring what happened to them.  Personally, I think this book could be improved by cutting at least 100 pages.    <br />Certainly the audience of this book is not limited to those who work in the field of information security.  On the contrary, this book is carefully crafted to be educational--without being intrusive about it, and it is much more successful in its technical agenda than its social one.   <br />If you provide technical services or engineering for the Internet--especially in the infosec field--you may find this book irresistable.  It isn't every day that someone in your field of employment has the chance to be the protagonist of a major literary work.
B00004XOWM|5.0|Limp Bizkit returns with their 3rd CD, the eagerly anticipated &quot;Chocolate Starfish and The Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot;. A host of guest vocals are included, including Xzibit (&quot;Getcha Groove On&quot;), DMX, Method Man, and Redman (&quot;Rollin': Urban Assault Vehicle&quot;). They have the Mission: Impossible 2 theme from the soundtrack (&quot;Take A Look Around&quot;), and the song that Fred Durst performed live with Christina Aguilera at the MTV Video Music Awards 2000 edition (&quot;Livin' It Up&quot;). &quot;My Generation&quot; is an awesome song, followed by other great tracks for rock/rap fans such as &quot;Rollin': Air Raid Vehicle&quot; (the rock version of the song title), &quot;Getcha Groove On&quot;, &quot;Rollin: Urban Assault Vehicle&quot; (the rap version of the song title), &quot;Livin' It Up&quot; and &quot;Take A Look Around&quot;.   Definitely get this CD if you have Significant Other, or Three Dollar Bill, Y'All (or both). If you enjoy KoRn and Kid Rock, than get this CD. Also look for Slipknot and Sublime.
B000046PVN|5.0|Superman was one of my all-time favorite movies, and I am pleased to now own the complete soundrack of John Williams brilliant score! Music which I love to play constantly whenever I go to work! I actually own the soundrack to the film that I bought last year, but I was so pleased to now own the &quot;whole&quot; soundrack to the film! If you are a die hard frran like I am, you'll know the differance of this track compared to the first one! You'll thrill at John Williams score that brought a fictional character to life in 1978 when the film was released! I know I was!
B00000255F|5.0|There is not much I can say about this album that hasn't been said before.  Even though I am 16 I can still appreciate music like this and enjoy it to its fullness.  Bruce Springsteen is the greatest performer to ever exist, period.  I shiver everytime I hear these songs with excitement, emotion, and just plain awe.
B00004Y2QT|5.0|Throughout his career, The Man has demonstrated time and again that he is not only the greatest multi-instrument talented  musician living today, but he is also one of the greatest stage performers of his generation.  This DVD allows fams like myself, who have never been able to see him live, to get a taste of The Man on stage.  Bouncing from instrument to instrument, and showing that his amazing voice is as vibrant and striking as ever, Prince serves up a full plate of funk, rock, R&amp;B, blues, hip-hop, and even a dash of techno.  What you are seeing on this disc is not a pay-per view special so much as it is a concert that Prince felt like putting on television.  I was also thankful for the guestspots granted to Lenny Kravitz, Maceo Parker, and the bonus track that features George Clinton doin' his thang.  Also interesting is the addition of Kip Blackshire to the NPG.  Check out his skills on &quot;Higher&quot; and &quot;1999.&quot;  That brothers got some pipes on him.  All told a spectacular event, this DVD is a must have for any fams of Prince and the NPG.<br />             PEACE AND B WYLD
0783243499|3.0|(My following comments may give away essential plot points.)<br />The movie puts us in the mind of a mad man, Patrick Bateman, who's telling us his story.  Identity is a hard thing to come by in his Wall Street world, even for his male colleagues, with their unexplained misogynism.  Work, living address, clothes, restaurants frequented and particularly the design of one's business card are vital means for providing this.  Attempting to explain the point of everything to his fiancee, Bateman says in his careful pronunciation, &quot;Because I want to fit in.&quot;<br />Bateman's story is complicated by his increasing insanity.  He tells us that he's very aware that he's not what he pretends to be.  But he's unaware in his storytelling that much if not all of his overpowering, murderous mental state is not really acted out.  We know this because of the completely outrageous and careless way his crimes are committed.  And secondly his desperate point blank confessions lack supporting physical evidence or response from the listener.  These confessions and Bateman's efforts to maintain composure produce a degree of pathos for a wretched and despicable character.<br />There are dark humorous touches in the movie.  One is Bateman's smooth, practiced critique of the profundity of the pop music that he plays during some of his crimes.  Above all the movie is not a gore fest.
0140185232|5.0|I read this once before, in Rome, when i read most of the Maugham i have read ~ several novels and large quantities of the short stories.  I have, at least to a degree, the same reaction now i had then:  Is this fiction or truth disguised as fiction?  Doubtless the reaction (one of them) Maugham wanted one to have.  I feel that this book is didactic in a differing way from Maugham's usual stories; not heavy-handed ~ my inclination is to call the others often heavy-handed ~ but straighter, more honest about the didacticism.  The question that arises, of course, is What are we supposed to learn from Larry Darrell?  And, Is this the story of Larry or Elliot, Isabel, and Gray?  And, Is this truly a success story, as Maugham claims, or, just as reasonably, a story of the failure of the story-teller's art?  I can't answer the questions, of course; i can just pose them.  So, do i like it, or is that another unanswerable question?  Yes; i liked it in the early '80s and i like it today.  As a description of how to live your life, what the answers to the questions of faith are, a solution to the problem of evil, it is an utter failure:  Larry never gives an inch on allowing anyone to know his quest or its results.  As a picture of a man's quest to understand it is a success.  The story could not be told otherwise:  Even the periodic style of revelation fits the subject matter, beause that is how our lives  and any searches we undertake are.  We do not, except in the rarest cases, proceed straight from birth, though maturity and a search, to understanding.  Our lives are episodic, convoluted, and puzzling.  &quot;The Razor's Edge&quot; does not sort through the confusion, it merely asserts that one man has found a path to his satisfaction.
0767903854|4.0|First, the bad news. Characteristic of most of Bill Bryson's travel writing, &quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot; is not really a travel memoir. It doesn't contain much reflection, reveals little about the memoirist, and doesn't really capture the essence of the country.<br />But that's it for the bad news. The good news is that &quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot; is probably Bryson's funniest book since &quot;Neither Here Nor There.&quot; Faced with a country so full of eccentricities as Australia, Bryson has a field day here.<br />Furthermore--and I feel that this has always been underestimated about Bryson--he's an exceptional researcher. This book won't serve as a standard history of Australia, but it's chock-full of the trivia that most researchers would undoubtedly have missed. It is through these little tidbits that Bryson really touches on the soul of Australia in a way that run-of-the-mill travel essayists can't. He may not enumerate the prime ministers of Australia, for example, but his anecdote about seeing an ex-deputy prime minister selling copies of his autobiography at a market will tell you loads more about the essence of Australia.<br />With all his (pleasant) rambling and his slapdash itinerary, this book won't serve as a practical guide to anyone who's planning to travel Down Under, but it will give you a view of the country that you won't get from any other travel writer or guidebook around.<br />And did I mention that it's hysterically funny? Even those who aren't big on geography or history will appreciate those subjects here. With Bryson's wit and humor, things are never dry. And even when he gets sarcastic, it doesn't sting, because you feel that his humor comes from a good place. It's a trick so few other humorous writers can pull off.
B00000DC10|5.0|this is absolutely the best album of the last 10 years, if not more, regardless of genre.  there is no doubt about it in my mind.  nothing like this had come out before or since.<br />as great as some of the stuff cobain did in the early '90s, it pales in comparison to the power of this record.<br />all i can say is that if you don't own this record, you are a musical moron.
B00000JY1X|5.0|I've had this box set for a year and still am amazed.. Stephin Merritt is incredibly talented and will be remembered for this creation of tunes in years to come. Whether it's catchy humorous pop (Ab.Cuckoo, Chicken..,I Think I Need a New Heart, etc.), sweet serenades (Come Back from San Fran., The Book of Love, Your My Only Home, etc.), experimental sounds(Love is Like Jazz, Xylophone Track, etc.) or classic duets (Yeah, Oh Yeah!, Papa was a Rodeo)... (shall I go on?)it's all good. There's a little bit of everything in this set, and it all fits together so perfectly.  I saw The Magnetic Fields perform all 69 Love Songs in a 2-night concert that touched my soul. This album, about love, taps into ambivalence, fears, disgusts, bliss, dysfuntion, etc....much of which can be expressed quite eloquently in a damn good song. Here's 69 of them. Buy it and enjoy.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I reluctantly went to this movie (it was my husbands turn to pick) because it looked like a sweaty guy movie.  Oh my!  I have seen this movie in the theater 5 times without my husband, and will watch it in my home a thousand more times.  Everything about it was captivating--from the cinematography to the music, to the story, to the acting--especially to Russell Crowe.  Go ahead and order the movie.  You and the women in your family will not be disappointed.
B0000033IR|5.0|If, like myself you're into the gritty, soul drenched Musle Shoals sound, then you've got to hear Lady Soul. Aretha has no peer, there simply is no other soul singer dead or alive who can stand along side The Queen of Soul. Keep your Dinah Washingtons', Patti LaBelle, Gladys Knight, Carla Thomas, Ruth Brown, Diana Ross, Tina Turner, Dione Warwick, Whitney Houston, Mary Wells, Martha Reeves, (have I forgotten anyone?). Keep them all. Aretha is the real thing. She has that special something deep down inside, that just reaches out and grabs you. I could go on and on, but what's the use. Just give this record one listen and you'll know immediately, exactly what I mean.
0767814622|1.0|If you are making a film and call it a 'true story' then you should be making the film as it was in the real case. However, if you change the facts of the story so dramatically, no matter who you are, Oliver Stone or Alan Parker, what you do by using that two words -true story- becomes a COMMERCIAL ADVENTURE BUT NOT AN ART.<br />Simply the film is about an American trying to smuggle some illegal staff (2kg. or so) through Turkey and been caught up and jailed. He gets severe punishments in 1970's Turkey where smuggling was followed up very dense, but even the real character admits 'not that much' as Oliver Stone slightly(?) adjusts the facts to make some more money, MONEY!<br />Yes he actually did. He win an award (no question about how awards are decided on in Hollywood) he made some 50 people, including me, to comment on this page. For what?<br />One thing in last, anyone who have some background education &amp; international experience in life, LIKE YOU PEOPLE, i.e. getting on the net, reading comments, searching books, etc. can understand the deviations in the film from the facts and purpose of making such a movie;<br />BUT unfortunately, when this movie comes on screens anywhere else in the world, most of the people on our planet with a low knowledge of that nation and with a lack of judgemental capacities do and will continue to think how disastrous people the Turks are and how horrible a country it is to live in. That is what disappoints the Turks and the people who know the real Turks.<br />I hope it was helpful; thank you for reading.
B000001FY5|5.0|I saw Bob Marley in concert back in 1979 at the Beacon Theater in NYC. What an absolutely magical night that was. Not only was I transformed into an instant fanatic Marley follower, but since that incredible performance, my wife and son have also become huge fans and even our family dog is named, what else but....Marley.<br />Of the dozen or so studio albums, Exodus stands out as my personel favorite. With some of reggae's greatest song writing, One Love/People Get Ready, Jamming, Three Little Birds and my all-time, all-time favorite Waiting In Vain, Exodus is one of the strongest works by reggae's poet laurret.
0553579908|2.0|Well, A Game of Thrones was a great book. The characters were the most incredible people I've ever read, and the plot line went along amazingly smoothly, considering that there were many different people and the point of view changed from chapter to chapter.<br />Unfortuatly, all is not well in paradise.<br />A Clash of Kings book is heavy, boring, and cumbersome. While I could stand the sex scenes in A Game of Thrones, they became beyond disgusting in this installment, making me wonder if the author wrote them for his own personal enjoyment. The characters were excellent, but the plot line confusing; more than once did I wonder what on earth was going on. <br />Not the greatest, but I'm sure not the worst. Let's hope that the next book is better.
6305949972|5.0|Whatever Tim Burton touches somehow manages not only to be a good movie, but a work of art at the sametime. Such is the case with 'NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS'. It's artistic merits as well as Burton's conceptual genius, dark comedic settings, characters and situations, create an absolutely enchanting tale of Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King and his vision of ghoulish Christmas.  This is the finest as well as the best stop-motion animation film of all-time in my opinion. It draws elements from classics such as &quot;Mad Monster Party&quot; and &quot;Rudolph, the Red Nosed Riendeer&quot; and advances those techniques times 1 Million. <br />Burton creates a magical story, the comical other world of the Holidays, a technical wonder, a masterpiece, and a work of art!
B00000ILDF|4.0|This is a good sequel but it certainly doesnt measure up to Alien and Aliens. On their way home from the colony planet from Aliens there is a fire aboard the ship and they hyperspace section of the ship is released from the ship. It crash lands on a deslate planet inhabitated by prisoners. Ripley(Sigourney Weaver) is the sole survivor of the crash. Hicks and Newt die and Bishop is destroyed beyond repair. Ripley discovers that an alien egg was layed on the ship by the queen alien from Aliens. She also disovers she was impregnated by that alien. There is also more involvement by the company to preserve the alien, this time thats inside Ripley. Look for the real Bishop in a small part. This film is a good sequel. I was not disapointed with it, but i can see why others were. Its less action packed than Aliens, which I think let fans down. Not me though. I reccomend you see, I dont guarentee you will love it though. Rated R for strong language, violence, and more alien gore
0446677450|1.0|I normally try to be positive and find the best in things. But this book is a waste of time, considering the many good investment books out there. It has a few valuable points, but they could be stated on one page.  To the authors defence, I am in favor of books that cut to the bone and I really hate having to read hundreds of pages of nothing, to get his point.  <br />If you are a first time reader of this kind of topic, the book is okay. As long as you understand that it will wont give you any tools - just rough guidelines. <br />I, unfortunately, also listen to the audiotape. Its even worse.
B00004U3UG|3.0|This is the first time I've seen the added scenes from Army of Darkness...and frankly I prefer the theatrical release more...There is no way to watch the theatrical release with this disc either...you're just stuck with the Directors Cut...It seems to get REALLY dark when the Deadites are coming to attack, I had to turn up the brightness on my TV to make it distinguishable what the heck was going on...I prefer my laser disc transfer to this disc..ssoooooo...I'll probably pick up the theatrical release edition and let this one collect dust...
0316286850|2.0|Great book if you live your life on the runway, in a magazine, a photograph or movie. Anyone can take some of the world's most beautiful people and put make-up on them and say &quot;How pretty!&quot; I think more of the talent lies with the lighting technicians and those who hold the airbrush.     It's not all bad, though. There is much to laud: the format of the book is great, with all of the step-by-step instructions, the large photographs and the fact that everything is SHOWN rather than TOLD (drawings versus text) which is where most how-to cosmetic books fail. Most of the transformations are amazing as well but how much of this depends solely on Aucoin's talent is debatable.       Aucoin is definitely an artist, but this book seems far too politically motivated and self-indulgent (&quot;look at all the pretty people I know!&quot;) I feel that he also holds back more than he lets on. His views change from magazine article to book(s)and back to magazine article more often than I care to admit ( &quot;Apply sparingly and build up color&quot; vs. &quot;Put on as much as you like. You can always take it off&quot;).  My favorite is his  claim that he prefers not to use foundation, when almost all of the make-overs obviously use foundation (and plenty of it!).      This book is great as an art book, and some tips are helpful, but on the whole &quot;Making Faces&quot; is more like &quot;Making Fantasy&quot;; making beautiful people even more beautiful through the use of make-up, sets, perfect lighting, airbrushing and the advice of a dozen or so &quot;assistants&quot;.
B00003CXDG|2.0|I love John Woo.  From Hong Kong movies such as Hard Boiled and The Killer to his American movies, the man has proven time and again that he is an absolute master of the action movie genre.  Unfortunately, that's why he was a poor choice to direct a Mission Impossible movie.<br />I grew up watching the original television show and this movie had virtually none of the elements that made the series so successful.  The only &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; element found in this movie was the use -- over use, actually -- of the molded masks.  There was none of the fun that I found in the television series present in this movie.  I'm talking about how the IM team would manipulate the bad guys into bringing about their own downfall.  The IM team never carried guns.  They didn't race around on motorcycles.  They worked behind the scenes, quietly doing their job then quietly driving away as the bad guys took the fall.<br />As action movies go, this is a good movie.  Not great.  Not Woo's best by a long shot, but it's still a good action movie.  But it's supposed to a Mission Impossible movie.  And that's where it falls on its face.  And that's why I scored it low.  Of course, if that doesn't bother you, then you'll probably enjoy the movie.
6304385668|5.0|Yeah paka mate, beautiful film,really interesting, kept my attention the whole film which can't be said for most.My favourite quote &quot;We won't play by their rules we'll invent our own&quot; Ingenious also how they bought real life film footage of events and placed it into the actual reinactment of Irelands &quot;triumph,terror and tragedy&quot;.Understand now alot more about Irish history, and English vrs Irish history.
B000001IQH|5.0|I don't care how often they are compared to the Clash - Rancid are one of the all-time great punk bands. Album after album, they've delivered tight songs with caustic melodies that you can't stop playing over and over. And of all those albums, guess which one is the best? ...and out come the wolves! I'm not the only one here who says so - just look at some of the other reviews. Try not to enjoy &quot;Roots Radicals&quot;, &quot;Olympia&quot;, or &quot;Journey to the End of the East Bay&quot;.  How about &quot;She's Automatic&quot;? The songs are infectious, the lyrics insightful and conjuring up vivid images in your mind during almost every song - can't you just see the guys on that city bus during &quot;Roots Radicals&quot;? Listen to &quot;The War's End&quot; and &quot;You Don't Care Nothin'&quot;, and then try to tell me you don't want this album? If you already have it, I'm sure your sentiments are pretty much the same as mine. One of my all-time favorite albums.
0399146253|3.0|I was so excited when I realized The Last Precinct was finely available. I have read all of the books in the series and was very ready to join Kay, Lucy, and Marino on all new adventure. Sadly, though, it just seemed that we were reliving old stories. Cornwell seems to be trying to tie together too many of her plots and it comes up very weak.<br />I really think it is time she put Benton to rest, as well as Carrie Grethen. Kay and the gang neeed new foes to fight and some new allies as well.<br />I do not believe Cornwell has lost her touch, she is just going the wrong direction. I hope there is another Scarpetta book, as I do love these characters so, but I would like to see a fresh story.<br />Other authors, such as Ridley Pearson and Jeffrey Deaver, are managing to continuously turn out quality stories with their cast of characters, and Cornwell is just as talented. I hope this talent shines through in her next book.
0679879269|5.0|Anyone who has read The Amber Spyglass and The Subtle Knife must read this book; I read it and I still can't stop thinking about it. The writing is beautiful, and seeing all the loose ends finally tied up so artfully is very fufilling.
1881273156|4.0|We talked about this book at my College Girls Bible Study, and I was intrigued by it.  I am not married or even in a relationship, but I still found it extremely helpful.  This book discusses the fact that people have different concepts of what &quot;love&quot; is.  For the time being, I can apply the basic concepts of this book to any relationship, with either family or friends.  I am also glad that I have read this book before starting a serious relationship because I think it will help me to be aware that I may have to show love in different ways for different people.  I would highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in learning about how to make others happy!
0684853523|5.0|Surprise! Stephen King, master of the horror fiction genre, wrote a second nonfiction book, &quot;On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft.&quot; Surprise! S.K. penned a pageturner on his writing life (\\"C.V.\\"), his toolbox (well-constructed metaphor for a writer's toolkit), his practical advice for writers, his reading list, and his recent near-fatal accident. Surprise! This book appealed not only to his fans but also to those who have not read his other thirty books. <br />For an editor, what's not to love about an author who says, in his Third Foreward, &quot;One rule of the road not directly stated elsewhere in this book: 'The editor is always right' . . . .[and] to write is human, to edit is divine.&quot; I have recommended this book to several novelists, both for King's teaching on the craft of writing and for his down east sensibilty.   <br />Mr. King's &quot;C.V.,&quot; a creative &quot;Curriculum Vitae,&quot; offers this keen insight: &quot;In my character, a kind of wildness and conservativism are wound together like hair in a braid.&quot; So he recounts adventures and academic credentials.      <br />One evening, King asked San Francisco author Amy Tan what was the one question they were never asked. She replied, &quot;No one ever asks about the language.&quot; In &quot;On Writing,&quot; King shows us the language; he writes fresh, funky, in-your-face prose. Here are a few nuggets: &quot;. . . my testicles turned into stoplights&quot;; &quot;. . . by most Friday afternoons I'd felt as if I'd spent the week with jumper cables attached to my brain&quot;; &quot;. . . perky as a rat in liverwurst.&quot; No &quot;deified plums&quot; here.

6304118406|5.0|I've watched this film so many times I've got past the violence - its not just to do with that.  Its taking the piss out of people who love violence. Now I see a great love story and above all I see the best cinematography - I've never seen anything like it before.  The only comparisons I could make would be in 'JFK', 'Un Bout de Souffle', and 'Man Bites Dog'.  I love the sitcom parody, and the way the camera style changes so often, I cannot see how anyone could not find this one of the most compelling films ever.  It rocked me. This isn't just any old Resevoir Dogs/texas chainsaw massacre film. If it's not your bag - just see past the violence and stop slagging it off.  By the way if those kids who went on the killing spree in real life hadnt seen the film they would have done it anyway.
630382790X|5.0|Tense as the best murder mysteries and as kinetic as the most exciting action films, this space adventure is as thrilling as movies get.<br />Even though Apollo 13 is based on real events and the ending is thus a foregone conclusion, imaginative directing by Ron Howard and extraordinary acting make for a combined barn burner, flag-waver, tearjerker and edge-of-the-seater.<br />Hanksplays Jim Lovell, the astronaut in command when Apollo 13 blasted off on April 11, 1970, aiming for a moon landing. His crew was Jack Swigert (Bacon), a last-minute replacement for the measles-exposed Ken Mattingly (Sinise), and Fred Haise (Paxton). Harris plays the NASA-based mission controller, Gene Kranz, and Quinlan is Lovell's devoted wife, Marilyn.<br />Howard displays a stalwart respect for the courage and resourcefulness of the astronauts and their earthbound support team as the mission is stymied by a capsule explosion that prevents a moon landing and threatens the lives of the crew. Using camera angles that accent the claustrophobic confines of the space capsule and the closeness inside the Houston control room, Howard absorbs the audience into the drama.<br />Quinlan, as a wife who respects her husband's daring and explorer's spirit even as she fears their possible consequences, helps ground the film too, as do the young actors playing the Lovells' children, Miko Hughes, Mary Kate Schellhardt, Emily Ann Lloyd and Max Elliott Slade. Even Jean Speegle Howard, director Ron's real-life mom, humanizes the story as Lovell's aging mother, frustrated because her nursing home's TV set is broken and she can't watch coverage of the mission.<br />As the Apollo 13 astronauts face first the danger of freezing in space, then the danger of incineration on reentry to Earth's atmosphere, Howard builds the tension, intercutting actual news footage of the event as anchored by such commentators as Walter Cronkite, Chet Huntley, Frank Reynolds and Jules Bergman. Those familiar faces add to both the nostalgia and the movie's ulterior motive.<br />Not only is Apollo 13 great entertainment; it is a magnificent brief for reinvigorating the space program.the nostalgia and the movie's ulterior motive. <br />Not only is Apollo 13 great entertainment; it is a magnificent brief for reinvigorating the space program.
B000001DTM|5.0|This is one of the best albums of the 90's.  As my favorite bands are the police and u2, I have to say this is my favorite u2 CD of all time, although I love the others such as &quot;Joshua&quot; and &quot;War,&quot; as well as the new ATYCLB.  It seems to mix everything together to make a perfect album for every music listener.<br />The first word I think of about this album, ofcourse, is ONE.  I think this is one of the most moving songs I've ever heard, I still think I hear it every day.  Then the album has the smash hits such as &quot;mysterious ways&quot; and &quot;better than the real thing.&quot;  Then songs like &quot;Wild your Wild Horses&quot; and &quot;end of the world&quot; also were hits on the album.  But all the other tracks are all amazing, and there are no skip-throughs on this CD.<br />Hidden amongst the more &quot;popular&quot; songs are also great tracks like &quot;the fly&quot; and &quot;light my way,&quot; with great rhythm, and then the more mellow &quot;so cruel.&quot;<br />This is a must have, no just for u2 fan, but for any MUSIC fan.  A masterpiece!
B00000IPAX|5.0|I have had this cd for four months now, and it has not left my cd player since.  Every song on this cd is good.  I must admit  that I bought the cd for the songs I heard on the radio ( All the small things, What's My Age Again, and Adam's Song), as I'm sure many of you will do.  When I first put it on, I found out that although the songs they played on the radio were great, the ones they didn't made this cd as good as it is.  Songs like Aliens Exist, Dystentary Gary, Mutt, Wendy Clear, and especially Going Away To College are great, as are the ones I didn't mention.  I especially like Going Away to College, because it is one of the only songs in which Blink grew up, writing a song that not only has an unforgetable melody, but has great lyrics that talk of splitting up because of college, and all the uneasiness, and fear that goes along with it.  This, in my personal opinion, is the only song that can rival Adam's Song as the best on the cd.                 Speaking of Adam's Song, I cannot possibly write a review of this cd without devoting a good amount of time to it.  Adam's Song is another song in which Blink grew up.  They tell the story of a troubled teenager, suicide and death, and complete it with a deceptively complex melody, and excellent musicianship.  It is by far the best on the cd, and my favorite song, ever.  This song is just so good.  I've tried in the preceding lines to describe how much I like it and I can't really do it.  Maybe that's because it hits a personal note with me.  I don't know. Anyway, it's an incredible song.                   This is the best cd I own.  If you like alternative, punk, or anything even remotely similar, you will love this cd. You won't be disappointed.
0312954468|5.0|The River God is one of the most entertaining books I have ever read.  Set back in the time when the Pharaoh's ruled Egypt, there comes a man named Taita who leads Egypt and his mistress through years of prosperity and hardship .  The book is wonderfully written with characters that are believable and who the reader cares about.  The detail in which Smith writes actually transports you to another world.  At times the book leaves you wondering is this fiction or non-fiction.  By far Smith's best work and If you like this book you should read the Seventh Scroll.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This film's title fits perfectly.<br />\\"American Beauty\\" is, in a sense, the \\"Rebel Without A Cause\\" of our time.  A look at the dark side of humanity, it delves into issues such as adultery, materialism, drugs, sex, lust, and murder.  Beautifully acted with fantastic direction, the film is a moving, interesting social commentary.
6305807043|5.0|I'd like to add to my previous review:  I've been looking at the reviews of this movie and I find that one thing that people complained about was how horrible the characters were, and how it was disgusting that we were supposed to laugh at that sort of thing.  Well, let me tell you my take on it: like Brazil, this movie starts as a comedy but ends as a tragedy.  You're not supposed to find the last half of the movie funny--it's depressing as hell, and it's designed that way.  You're not supposed to like the characters--they're all jerks, and that's deliberate.  Don't let the strangeness of it and the parts that actually /are/ funny (like everything relating to Lester's secretary) fool you into thinking that the later actions of Craig and Maxine are intended to amuse.
6305807086|5.0|I LOVED this movie!  It was so creative, so different, so...me!  John Cusack plays a frustrated pupeteer who is married to Cameron Diaz's character.  She is seriously into animals and the two live with a menagerie in their home.  Cusack gets a job in the wierdest place imaginable...and there he finds the portal that leads to John Malcovich's mind.  Soon, he and his coworker, played by Catherine Keener, are raking in the dough by letting people be John Malcovich for fifteen minutes for a mere $200.  Things take a turn when Cusack falls in love with Keener, but Keener is in love with Diaz...but only when Diaz is in Malcovich!  Brilliantly written, well acted...awesome, awesome film.  Definatley a must see!!
6305807043|5.0|This is a great movie.  I'm usually annoyed by little inconsistencies in something like this, but here every detail that &quot;didn't work&quot; worked even better than what &quot;should have&quot; happened.  For instance, when Malkovich goes into the portal--infinite recursion, right? WRONG!  It would have been too obvious to do /that/...  At any rate, I thought every moment of this movie was pretty much perfect, and many aspects of it reminded me of another movie I love, Brazil--a mysterious company that doesn't seem to do anything, a woman who rejects the advances of the main characters before he even makes them, a wonderfully depressing ending.  And to top it all off, it used a fragment of Bartok's Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta, which is one of my favorite pieces of music.
052594527X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this story! The contrasts depicted in this story were true...there WAS an invisible divide between master and servant, there WAS a cultural division between Protestant and Catholic, and the cultural riches of the upper class vs. the mundane life of the lower class.  The character of Griet, the  quiet composure and discretion in her eyes that seem to hide guarded secrets seems to describe the girl in the painting! I loved the way Griet and her brother escape from their humdrum, quasi-abusive lives. The piercing of Griet's ear symbolized the loss of innocence and the gain of wisdom. Nice job, Ms Chevalier!
B00004X0Q0|5.0|i remember sorting through the used &quot;punk&quot; cd bin at my local record store when i happened upon &quot;acrobatic tenement&quot; by at the drive-in.  i'd heard of them from a friend of mine, so i asked the store clerk to play it on the stereo.  after listening to about 30 seconds of the first song, i told the guy i would buy it.  i listened to it the entire ride home and all of that day.  that night i got on the internet and searched for information about at the drive-in.  i found their web page and low and behold, that they were playing a city not too far from me the very next night!  it was a school night, but i begged the parents to let me borrow the car and drive the 1.5 hours to see the show.  it was the best show i've ever been to and i haven't been able to stop listening to at the drive-in since.  relationship of command is the best new album i have heard this year.  it's a bit fancier than their other stuff, but in a lot of ways, reminds me of the &quot;acrobatic tenement&quot; cd.  go buy this record and go see them live.  i just can't get enough of this band.
B00003CXDG|1.0|Wow.  Amazing.  I was so very impressed at how bad this movie was.  There were others in the theater that shared my point of view; I know this because I could actually hear them roll their eyes during the ridiculous courtship and expedited consummation of the Cruise and Newton character's &quot;relationship.&quot;  I know this because I heard them laughing during the tedious, overwrought &quot;action&quot; sequences.  And I know this because I heard them HOWL when Cruise emoted his laughable dialogue to Newton before parachuting from inside of the building.<br />A real triumph in bad movie making.  Bravo Mr. Woo!!!
B000002579|4.0|I first heard this (8-track) in June of 1976. (Actually, it was June 8, 1976...the night i graduated from high school).    A van full of three other very good friends and I were going to drive across the country to awaiting summer jobs in New Mexico. We played this 8-track over and over. Along with: Kansas: &quot;SONG FOR AMERICA&quot;, and: Head East...&quot;FLAT AS A PANCAKE.&quot; By the time we crossed the Colorado border, we knew all the lyrics, and would sing along. (We sounded terrible, but no one cared).    This is a dynamite CD to own: (&quot;LEFTOVERTURE&quot;), and will transport you back in time (if you're old enough to remember this music), and leave you smiling...    Ah yes, the 'good old days.' Unfortunately, this (and other) albums by Kansas are under-rated.    However, this is a GOOD album by Kansas; one I'd suggest if asked: &quot;What would be a good Kansas album to buy?&quot;    BUY AND ENJOY.
B000002KHY|5.0|I've been a fan of JT since the beginning. And I have all of his recordings, including this one. When I want a 'quick fix' of James I play this. It has a little something from his first 7 recordings. It is a MUST for anyone who appreciates this man's music. Carolina In My Mind, Fire and Rain, Sweet Baby James, Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight,Waling Man, Shower The People, You've Got A Friend are the songs to relax with. James Taylor is the BEST performer from the 70s who knows how people feel at times.
0553106635|5.0|It shocked me and upset my stomach. Fiction doesn't do that to me, so Martin must be writing about real people in a real world somewhere. The stakes are high, for writer and character: this series will be discussed and emulated for decades. Martin has set the bar higher for his own work and for those who follow him, or try to. There are no cartoon Dark Lords or intricate authorial puzzles to negotiate, and no Ring or magic jewel to bring a happy ending. In a world so real you can smell the icy wind and hear ravens quorking, Martin has braided an epic story of ice and fire, blood and guts, love and disgust, honor and treachery, and most of all, right and wrong. Who are the true knights? Who are the true nobles? While mankind squabbles, the eerie Others march from their icy northern wastes, and a zombie horde precedes them. Winter is coming. It's colder than expected.
0553573403|5.0|I just want to write an additional echo to those that have already been written here.  I can't think of ANY book I've read in the past 5 years that will stay with me like 'A Game of Thrones' will.  Pure talent went into the writing of this book. For those expecting to read a fantasy on the heels of Terry Brooks, or Jordan or any number of novels in print these days beware: this book couldn't possibly be more different.  Magic isn't obvious.  Resolutions to problems are not neatly wrapped<br />in a package to put a smile on our face at the end of the book. Major characters may or may not meet an untimely demise.  Those who you previously thought were good guys may turn out to be as bad as they come.  In short, EXPECT the UNEXPECTED.  Go ahead and just TRY to predict what is going to happen.  I can almost guarantee you'll be wrong (if you end up right, you might wanna try looking into becoming one of those 1-900 Psychics...).  All of the traditional 'ideas' we have come to expect in a novel are thrown out the window with 'A Game of Thrones'.  Nothing is as it seems.  And expect a grand ride on a roller-coaster of pure adrenaline.  Simply put THE GREATEST Fantasy series in print today, and quite possibly the best of all-time.  I LOVED this book, I can't say it any more plain than that.  And as you can see from other's who have reviewed this book, I am NOT alone.
1573225517|5.0|Wow! High Fidelity is one of the funniest and most musical novels I have ever read! This was book was given to me by a friend, and I marvel at the great storytelling and knowledge of music. I even listened to some of the songs that were mentioned in the novel. Songs I haven't heard in such a long time! The book talks about relationships from a male standpoint and I could relate to his romantic escapades. I will definitely look for more work from this great author.
B000002UUX|5.0|This cd is a great example of one of the better thrash/speed metal cds. There isn't a lot of songs on here but the songs on this album are all very well done. My favorite songs would have to be TORNADO OF SOULS, HANGAR 18, HOLY WARS...THE PUNISHMENT DUE, TAKE NO PRISONERS, and RUST IN PEACE...POLARIS. If you like thrash/speed metal then you should go out and buy this cd sometime because you won't be disappointed.
B000002HH9|4.0|I became a fan of the Cure the same year this album was released: 20 years after they first formed, and 20 years after I was born. (As a teenager I never listened to their music, but I knew who they were.)<br />&quot;Wild Mood Swings&quot; is the second Cure album I bought, on cassette. (I almost bought it first, but I saw &quot;Standing On a Beach&quot; and bought that instead. It was one dollar cheaper.) What drew me to the Cure was not misery and angst, as other fans have said, but seeing their clip to &quot;The 13th&quot;. I loved the madness of it, especially towards the end. Film-clips really can sell albums.<br />I agree with other fans by saying &quot;Wild Mood Swings&quot; is not my favourite Cure album. But it wasn't that bad either. There are certain tracks that don't appeal to me, such as &quot;Gone&quot; and &quot;Strange Attraction&quot;. But the album has its strengths. &quot;This is a Lie&quot; is a song that I like. It has a sort of medieval sound to it. &quot;Want&quot;, &quot;Mint Car&quot; and &quot;The 13th&quot; are also quite stong in my opinion.<br />I have to admit I haven't listened to this album in a long time, as our cassette player doesen't work. This means I've forgotten what a lot of the other songs sound like. I either have a short memory, or the other songs just aren't that memorable. With the exception of W.M.S. and Standing On A Beach the other Cure albums I have are on compact disc. But I'm not going to buy W.M.S. in that format. This might give you an idea of the album's quality. But you should decide for yourself.
1559947608|3.0|My belief is that most people who are seriously involved in the Internet business will find this book to be around an even mix of things that are a) useful, b) completely obvious, c) probably only partly correct.<br />I don't regret reading it, but I wouldn't particularly recommend it if you are in the business and, like most people in the business, have limited time.
B000002BFZ|5.0|This is Pearl Jam's most advanced album in terms of subtlety, depth, and art. Harder to appreciate and digest than their earlier albums, but to someone willing not to judge and to really listen to the intricate themes and melodies, as well as the insightful lyrics, it is Pearl Jam's best. It is comparable to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band by the Beatles. Both are better listened to as a complete album. Both are not the most popular of their respective band's albums, but are their band's magnum opus in terms of creating interesting music. Highlights of &quot;No Code&quot;:  &quot;Red Mosquito&quot;- Merges from squealing, buzzing electric guitars that are reminisent of a mosquito's drone or a Led Zepplin guitar solo to quiet and intricate sections featuring acoustic guitar. Reminds me of &quot;Alive&quot;, except this is more textured and complex. &quot;Sometimes&quot;- Quiet, incredibly subtle and beautiful instruments and vocals. Moving and cryptic lyrics. &quot;In My Tree&quot;- Passionate singing from Vedder, strange but awesome instrumental ending make this a great song. Add a great melody and riffs and it's even better. The entire CD is incredible. The bluesy &quot;Smile&quot;, the sad, musically genius acoustic ballad &quot;Off He Goes&quot;, the rocking &quot;Hail, Hail&quot;, the rythmic &quot;Who We Are&quot;, and the contemplative &quot;Present Tense&quot; are also gems. The only misses on this CD are the infernally annoying &quot;Mankind&quot;, which is sung by Jeff Gossard (WHY,GOD,WHY?), and the overly hardcore &quot;Lukin&quot;.<br />BUY THIS CD!
B00004XONN|5.0|What can I say about KID A after 940 previous reviews?<br />Well...I can say that it´s the only possibly step Radiohead could take after OK COMPUTER. All the expectations created for this album made it almost impossible for Thom &amp; Co. to surprise their fans. If they had made an album just like the previous one, people probably would find it easier to listen to, but they surely would not be THE BEST BAND OF THE WORLD as they are now. <br />Simply because people want to be amazed all the time and there was no other way for Radiohead than to make the album that simbolize the arrival of the new millenium. Maybe the music should be devided in &quot;before KID A&quot; and &quot;after KID A&quot;. How can a band nowadays make a record that surprises the listener like this one? I will not talk about the brilliance of the &quot;songs&quot; themselves, because it was all said before. The importance of this album is that it definetely raises Thom Yorke as the musical genious of our times, showing that there´s still intelligence in a world filled with Backstreet boys and Britney´s. <br />That´s why it´s the most important record of all times.
B00003CXDG|5.0|best chase ever for that matter. Almost all the ideas are original and the stunts are awesome. Of course there is some cheese and other lame stuff (like the car twirling). The plot is so-so but does hold up relatively well. I would have given the movie 4 stars instead of 5, but the average review deserves more than 3. Glad to ad this one to the collection.
B00000J7JO|5.0|When i put this cd in and heard around the world, i thought i had bought the wrong cd. it sounds like limp bizkit or something. it has a rappy tune. i then discovered that almost all the songs had this. it's definitely their best one yet though. still the good songs (otherside, californication, scar tissue) DEFINITELY A WINNER! IF YOU LIKE CREED, RHCP, FOO FIGHTERS, AND FASTBALL, U SHOULD GET THIS! DON'T WAIT ANY LONGER!!
B00004XOWM|5.0|Upon reading the reviews of this CD, it seems as if they were all written by the same person.  There is absolutely no point in stating repeatedly that if you are a true &quot;metalhead&quot; go listen to Korn, NIN, or Rage.  After the 30th time, it grows old.  I may not be a &quot;metalhead&quot; and I don't care.  I listen to all types of music, but rarely ever buy Cd's, as it is cheaper to make them.  However, I heard some of these songs on the radio and went out and bought Starfish the day it came out.  I was not disappointed.  There is every type of music here, and there is not one song that you instantly skip over.  Fred Durst may not be a musical genius but he writes good lyrics and contrary to popular belief, HE CAN RAP! &quot;Getcha Groove On&quot; was one of the best songs on the album.  So if you want a Cd that's worth the money and can be listened to over and over again, go get it.  If you want to slam Fred and Limp as &quot;sell-outs&quot; and untalented, then you are still buying the CD, which means you can't hate them too much.
0451169514|4.0|OK, first off, I despise Stephen King books. I saw the film and fell in love w/ these characters, ran out &amp; bought this book. I've read it every year since. I simply cannot recommend it highly enough. The characters will stay w/ you forever. If you never buy any other novel by King, may It be the one.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Face it: I got this CD for Christmas because I loved the first CD and I loved their hit \\"I Knew I Loved You.\\" But even though that song is pretty good, and it was my ex-boyfriend and my \\"song,\\" it is definitely NOT the best on the album.<br />This CD is so amazingly touching and filled with emotion, I can't even put it into words. \\"Hold Me,\\" a powerful song about a relationship that's falling apart, declares, \\"Isn't happiness worth more than a golden diamond ring? I'm willing to do anything to calm the storm in my heart. I've never been the praying kind, lately I've been down upon my knees, not looking for a miracle, just a reason to believe . . .\\" The pathos continues with \\"Two Beds & A Coffee Machine\\" a beautifully written score by Daniel about a woman in an abusive relationship, and \\"The Lover After Me,\\" about a man trying to recover from a relationship he feels shouldn't be over. The CD's title song, \\"Affirmation,\\" is a powerful expression of beliefs, including: \\"I believe that beauty magazines promote low self-esteem.\\" The other hit track, \\"Crash and Burn,\\" is not my favorite, but it is also well written, and very moving. It convinces us that even when we're \\"all alone and the world has turned its back on you\\" there is always someone you can turn to. Finally, \\"The Animal Song,\\" probably the most \\"fun\\" song on the CD, is just wonderful. It is fun, exciting, and of course, it conveys a good message.<br />\\"I Don't Know You Anymore\\" didn't start out as one of my favorites. In fact, I used to skip over it every time. But after I started listening to it, I realized that it was a really good song about a guy who regrets breaking off a relationship. \\"I know I let you down, again and again. I know I never really treated you right, I paid the price, I'm still paying for it everyday . . .\\"<br />\\"The Best Thing\\" is kind of fun, but nothing like \\"The Animal Song,\\" though some of the lyrics are kind of catchy. \\"Sometimes sanity takes vacation on me,\\" is probably the BEST phrase I've heard in a song in a LONG time, \\". . . you and I rollercoaster ride: in love.\\" \\"Chained To You\\" is an interesting song, but compared to the others, it isn't much. It's just basically about a love/lust at first-sight encounter.<br />The songs I really don't like are \\"Gunning Down Romance\\" and \\"You Can Still Be Free,\\" even though their messages are good. The first compares love to a drug, and the second was written as the result of deaths of friends of both Darren and Daniel.<br />Over all, if you can't already tell, it is a beautifully written CD. Daniel uses a lot more piano in this album than in their debut, and I think it really adds to the quality of the music. Also, Darren's voice has gotten stronger in the past 2 years, giving it an even better overall value!! I HIGHLY recommend it!<br />Unfortunately, Savage Garden recently broke up, which makes the music they made together even more special--if you do not already own this CD, it is definitely a valuable investment!ase I've heard in a song in a LONG time, \\". . . you and I rollercoaster ride: in love.\\" \\"Chained To You\\" is an interesting song, but compared to the others, it isn't much.

B00004YA66|2.0|whatever these reviewers are on, I want some. This movie dragged. I kept waiting for something cool to happen, but they just kept talking to eachother over the mic-bla bla bla blaaa. I wouldn't know if the conversation was good because I just fastforwarded all of it after a while. A real bore.
B00004XOWM|3.0|Well, LB is at it again with a new album. It's business as usual which means there are some catchy tunes and weak lyrics.  Fred Durst is about as articulate as a 13 year-old after 10 shots of tequila.  He's got the voice of a little kid too.  His weak lyrical ability is especially obvious on the album's 2 hip-hop tracks, where guests Xzibit, DMX, Method Man, and Redman simply blow him out of the water.  However, the album has some nice music accompanying Durst's whiny vocals, and that makes the album alright.
B000023VR9|5.0|Dr. Dre came out with this new album literally FULL of awesome songs. Even the songs that most people think are &quot;dull&quot; tend to make you want to get up and dance.  I would recommend this Cd to ANYONE who loves rap.  This new Cd is the top on the charts; it also features other big-time rappers such as Eminem, Xzibit, Snoop Dogg, and many others!!

B00004XONN|5.0|This album is for radiohead what the wall was for pink floyd. It's the first important album of the new millenium.  Radiohead will be a big influence for future musician and creators. It not only a music album, it's also a artistic creation that can compete in the creation department with the beatles.
0671027344|4.0|This book was extremely different than any other book I have ever read.  It is told from a fascinating perspective, only through letters written by Charlie to an unknown reciever.   While slightly unconventional, the reader can definitely relate to Charlie at times. Very easy to read!
0393317552|4.0|I'm puzzled as to why this book conjures such spitting-mad reviews when it is little more than a scholarly proposal, as opposed to a political line-in-the-sand.  It certainly has little to do with the Bell Curve.  <br />I suppose the explanation might lie with the moral character of the incensed.  I believe that any thoughtful person will find this to be an interesting book.
B000003S5H|4.0|I bought this CD after listening to it at a friend's house.  Some of the tunes are very pretty including the first tune which gently draws you in with a friendly bass line and catchy electric piano hook. While I could take or leave &quot;Sexy Boy,&quot; the next track, &quot;All I Need&quot; is a true keeper.  I never get tired of listening to this song. &quot;You Make It Easy&quot; is another stand out mellow, engaging vocal track.  &quot;Ce Matin La&quot; has a really nice, laid back feel and a beautiful trombone line that reminds me a little of a Burt Bacharat type song.  Normally, that might not be a plus but, it certainly is here.
B00003CWPL|1.0|A very dark and extremely disturbing film, that is so unpleasant it is almost unwatchable.<br />About a third of the people in the screening I attended walked out during the film.<br />Only a macabre curiosity kept me there, but I have no intention of watching it again.<br />Films this unpleasant are unnecessary.
B0000508U6|5.0|If you haven't heard them yet in the States, you will soon.  They're making a splash in the U.K. with their debut.  And if predecessor alt-ambiance rockers Radiohead and Travis are any indication of the American taste for neo-Brit rock they're soon to make their way into your portable CD players and 100-disc changers in the very near future.  It smells of recent Britrock spirit but seems to have its root much deeper in alt history.  You'll get early Dinosaur Jr., good Buffalo Tom, and Neil Young with a English accent.  It's the real deal.  Get it now and impress your friends.

0767805712|3.0|This film is well produced and well-acted, but has virtually no sci-fi elements in it. The ethical and social arguments are valid ( no pun intended ) but I was dissapointed in its lack of action, lack of sci-fi imagery and morose backround music. At times it is little more than a detective story, or a human interest drama. The film needed more excitement and much more creative imagery. Setting is given the back seat and there was no reason for that. What could have been a grand film is only average, though well acted.

0380733358|5.0|A writer friend referred me to this book as a great example of a gripping, edge of the seat novel which uses many sub-plots, which intersect beautifully as the story and sub plots converge. It's so excellently researched I would forget that it was a novel and be reading it, thinking it was a historical report. It kept me up late, kept me away from work I had to do. Those are the kinds of evidence that tell me I'm reading a great book. It was made into a movie, starring Donald Sutherland, so you can also enjoy the pleasure of viewing the flick after reading the book. Oops. Now you'll be picturing Die Nadel (the needle) as Donald Sutherland. Oh well, that's what I did and it worked great. Enjoy!
0316286443|5.0|Considered to be the best in the fashion industry, Kevyn Aucoin has shown that he is a visionary genius when it comes to transforming people with the flick of a brush. Mr. Aucoin, who left Louisiana and moved to New York in order to pursue a career and live life as a gay man without the ignorance and intimidation that plagues the South, has made himself a major force among Hollywood's elite due to his amazing ability to transform normal faces into breathtaking works of art. <br />With great friends that include Cher, Winona Ryder, Madonna, Tina Turner, and Julia Roberts, Aucoin has had the luck and success that he deserves. In his first book, &quot;Making Faces,&quot; Kevyn introduced his special kind of magic to the world when he showed how easy it is to transform yourself with blush, lipstick, tweezers, and other beauty aids. However, in \\"Face Forward,\\" Kevyn decided to employ some of the most famous faces in the entertainment world (in addition to several non-celebrities) in transforming them into personas of the past and present. <br />When I first opened this book, my mouth gaped on how powerful Kevyn's work can be. I couldn't believe my eyes on how he was able to transform Tori Amos to a Native American woman. He is amazing, and many other celebrities in this book will make you open your mouth in awe. Seeing Gwyneth Paltrow as James Dean, Liza Minelli as Marilyn Monroe, and Tina Turner as Cleopatra will blow you away. I especially loved seeing how he transformed his own mother into various radiant personalities that truly show that age is nothing but a number. Ms. Aucoin must be extremely proud that she has son with such immense talent.<br />Kevyn's work will blow you away! Purchase this book and discover how much of a genius Aucoin is. I can guarantee you will not be able to put this book down at first. Mr. Aucoin's work and words will leave a lasting impression on how the idea of beauty can be interpretated by many. In his own words and work, Kevyn proves that you don't have to be beautiful on the outside, but rather beautiful inside.
6302769043|4.0|This movie had only one real negative that I can think of.  Personally, I found the profanity a bit much in some scenes.  That is really only a minor quibble.  I think I would have enjoyed it more on television.<br />On to the positives.  Eastwood's best film.  Clint gives a powerful preformance.  The running gag about Will Munny not being the man he used to be is turned heart-wrenchingly tragic in the film's most powerful scene.  Not to give away to much but it involves the prostitute under the tree.  The best scene in the whole film.<br />The Schofield Kid is also extremely well acted.  He manages to make his character at once humorous and infuriating.  His confontration with Morgan Freeman over shooting a hawk is on of the film's great plot twists.  <br />Especially moving is the scene where Eastwood and Freeman snipe at their prey.  The effects of violence are well realized in this movie.  No glorification to be found here.<br />Gene Hackman gives a stunning protrayal of Little Bill Daggett.  How he manages to make him by turns hysterically funny and yet menacing I'll never know.  He earned his Oscar.<br />Extremely touching is the simple truth that for once a man changed.  William Munny was changed by a woman and her love.  I never found the explanation for her choice to love a man so given to violent distemper.  I could only marvel at it.  As I did with most of this movie.
B000001DQI|5.0|I don't know what to say! Everybody says that this is great album. Is great as they are saying? YES,IT IS! Highlights are CANDLE IN THE WIND,BENNY AND THE JETS,GYBR,I'VE SEEN THAT MOVIE TOO,SATURDAY,GREY SEAL and HARMONY. Great! Great! Great! Probably the best album from 70'es!
6305137293|4.0|I just bought this and as soon as I put the DVD in to watch it I was blown away. The picture is so crisp and clear! The colors are awesome. The sound is great, too. I just wish it had behind the scenes stuff like the other Halloween DVD's. Well, its an inexpensive DVD so you can't expect to get much with it. I don't like the cheap case it comes in either. Hopefully they reissue it, all remastered and inside a clamshell case like Halloween on DVD. If you have H2 on video you should see how awesome it is on DVD. You can hardly tell that this was filmed in the 80's, it's that good. Order a copy now!
B00004XONN|4.0|Lots of people love an album, so they overrate the next one by that artist. I'm not gonna do that. I'm not gonna overrate or underrate this album.<br />It's hard to believe Radiohead started their career with such an unoriginal, grunge re-hash song like &quot;Creep&quot;. Six years ago, I woulda thought they'd join the mass of one-hit wonders. But fortunately, Radiohead did a complete turnaround.<br />People who expect OK Computer Part II will be disappointed. But then again, anyone who wants their artist to rehash their music shouldn't voice their opinions at all, or listen to music. (Click no if you disagree!!)<br />Kid A is a fascinating, complex, rhapsodizing piece of music. It's a musical dream. Ever doze off in class or at home and have strange dreams that make no sense at the surface? That's kinda what this album is like. It's deep but abstract. Introspective yet noisy at times.<br />My favorite tracks (that you readers will no doubt disagree with): &quot;How to disappear Completely&quot;, &quot;Idiotheque&quot;, and the heavenly classic &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;--it's awesome.
B000004CYT|5.0|One is not going to hear sluggish, ponderous Beethoven on these discs (Karl Bohm's set with the Vienna PO from 1970 rings a bell). No, you will hear symphonies full of life and joy and impeccably steady tempi. The 7th is the least impressive but the sym. nos 1-6 and the 9th are just outstanding. This is one of the most consistently satisfying Beethoven sets right now. No ups and downs or 'preferred' task as with other conductors. Hogwood and the AAM convey the very soul and spirit of these works from beginning to end. Highly recommended!!
B000001EXB|5.0|I know,it's easy listening but is that matter!? I have no words to describe this perfect album! This album is magical. Live Like Horses is one of the best songs ever. The End Will Come is something new and different from other Elton's work and is just great. There is no weak song on this album. This is like the best kuschel rock album ever! If you like Mozart you will also like this.This is prove that captain is always captain!
B000002JSH|5.0|An excellent album that made Bad Company a band that was not just a &quot;one album wonder&quot;. When I think of Rock, good 1970's hard, classic rock, I think Bad Company and this album. The first album made Bad Co. popular, but this one cemented a lasting reputation.
B00004YX39|5.0|And so we come to what I assume is the end of the Steely Dan remastering project.  Aja was the last Dan album recorded in analogue (and apparently Fagen &amp; Becker did consider recording Gaucho digitally).<br />I was expecting this to be the Dan album that benefitted least from the re-mastering process -- as it was the most recent of the analogue albums -- but no, wrong again.  So much new detail is revealed in the mix that it constantly battles for my 100% attention.  In the past I could work quite happily with a Dan album playing in the background, but all these remastered versions just insist that I drop everything else and listen.  It's almost like listening to an entirely new set of tunes.<br />Once again we have Becker and Fagen's elliptic sleeve notes.  They contribute a vital perspective on what was going on at the time, without saying much about what was actually going on.  There is no reference to the copyright lawsuit that Keith Jarrett pursued and won -- compare the opening to 'Gaucho' and then Jan Garbarek's sax opening on 'Long as You Know You're Living Yours' on the 'Belonging' album.  What was such a talented songwriting team thinking of?<br />Allegedly Becker and Fagen made extensive use of a drum machine for this album -- Fagen felt that no drummer could keep a perfect beat -- but a human drummer is given a credit on each track.<br />Sadly Denny Dias is not on this album.  The track listings on the entire remastered series have made the fullest declaration yet of who played what on each track, and I have been astonished to find out this year how often Dias played some of my favourite 1970's guitar solos.<br />Larry Carlton, one of the the Dan's most stalwart session guitarists, turns up for just the last track, &quot;Third World Man&quot;, and boy, is that solo a goodie.  Apparently the solo had been hanging around, unused, in the Dan vaults for a number of years, and Fagen finally wrote the song around the solo.  It is a fantastic finale to theend of the first Dan era -- seven diamond-encrusted albums from what was the world's finest pop/rock/jazz/whatever band.  We will not see the likes of them again.
0679746048|4.0|this was an entertaining, thought provoking book, one that i have quoted many times since i read it.  If you've seen the movie, don't expect the book to be too similar, for it is not.  I read this over the course of a few days and i am anxious to read it again, to catch more details i missed in the initial reading.  pick it up for a good read!
B000003NA4|5.0|She sings like satin. I play this at work and no matter the mood there, she draws away the tension and leaves us mellow -- and wanting to light a candle and lay back. I have been becoming more of a jazz fan recently and she will become a staple of my collection.
B00004YW6I|5.0|I'm not ashamed to admit that I first downloaded a couple of tracks of &quot;Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea&quot; from Napster (Sorry PJ)just to get the flavor of the album. The first cut I downloaded was &quot;We Float.&quot; I was blown away at how angry, melancholy and transcendent it was. I knew immediately the entire album was going to be something special. I bought it and sure enough...a masterpiece. &quot;Big Exit,&quot; &quot;A Place Called Home&quot; and &quot;Horses In My Dreams&quot; rank right up with the best songs Polly Jean's ever written. I keep returning to &quot;We Float&quot; (the final cut) where she sings &quot;I was in need of help, headed to black out, util someone said run on in, honey, before someone blows your goddamn brains out...&quot; So raw and real. Music like this doesn't come along every day, folks. Buy this album.
B00003CXDF|3.0|Let's start out with the good points about &quot;Mission: Impossible--2.&quot; First, the action scenes are superb: director John Woo has created a stunning visual symphony of color and energy. It's high-tech violence infused with the beauty of poetry. Second, the special effects are flawless. And third, Tom Cruise's hair and physique look great.<br />Beyond those good points, I found &quot;M:I-2&quot; to be one of the biggest cinematic disappointments of 2000. This is a beautiful but hollow shell of a movie; the film's visual power does not make up for the moral and emotional void at the film's core.<br />The biggest problems involve Ethan Hunt, the character played by Cruise. Hunt's romance with the film's female lead (competently played by the exquisite Thandie Newton) is utterly unbelievable; the script gives no indication why these two should become so passionately devoted to each other. Is it just hormones? And Hunt's motivation with regard to the film's mission is similarly missing. Why is he so dedicated to his task and his organization? Does the Impossible Missions Force have a great benefits package, or what? The film's failure to go beyond the characters' surface actions left me feeling cheated.<br />The story (involving terrorists, a biological weapon, and a love triangle) is competently written, but I've seen the &quot;James Bond&quot; producers do it better before. And the rest of Hunt's team is pretty much wasted; &quot;M:I-2&quot; is an unrepentant star vehicle for Tom Cruise (as if the film's poster didn't give this away). By eviscerating the &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; teamwork element, the film's producers do a disservice to the memory of the original television series.
B00003CX7L|5.0|I had fun with Toy Story - I really enjoyed the animation and the movie was fun... but when my children wanted to see number 2 I was not as excited.  Did I laugh?  There is something in this movie for everyone!  Lots of humour that the children did not even catch on to, and I get a bit more each time I see it!<br />This movie is better than the first, and has even more for the whole family than the first!
0930289234|5.0|I love this book! A great tale. Perfect if you like comics. Hell, you could hate comics and you'll still like the book.
B00004XPP0|1.0|Some might wonder why I have given Star Wars one star, but there is a great reason behind it.  I'm only giving it one star based on what Lucas added to this presentation.  If you already own the trilogy don't bother about rushing out for this one.  The added section for Star Wars Episode 2 is not worth the money.  All you get is a brief summary of information we already know about given to you by Lucas himself.  A brief interview with the actors playing Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru, as well as a talk with Anthony Daniels who says how great it is to be playing C-3P0 after all these years.  The only fresh insight provided is telling us that C-3P0 will appear in a middle state where he has some of the look he will have in episode 4 but made up of spare outer parts.  If you are one of the few people that don't own the trilogy yet, by all means purchase it, is a wonderful set of movies that you wont have a chance to purchase for another 3-4 years.  But if do, and you just want a look at some episode footage rent don't spend the money again.
079073804X|5.0|I just watch this movie Oct the 13th on a Friday(Friday the 13th), and I'll just say I almost did not get to sleep.  I love scary movies and have always been a big fan, but most do not truley scary me.  While watching this movie on the big screen, was so deeping bothering to me.  I couldn't believe I was so scared and distured I was suffering from Heartburn!  I had to plug my ears and close my eyes!!  The sound effects and they words that were coming out of her mouth were terrifying!!  And I am hard to scare.  I know that the movie that was released had some extra footage that this DVD might not, but still it will scare you to the bone.  I also want to add that the shots that were added to the Exorcist, that came out in Oct 2000, were the scarest, most disturbing things i had ever seen, I know why they weren't released with the original!!  This is a great movie for any Horror Fan.  I highly recommend it!!
B00004Z459|5.0|This cd is a really balanced musically. It's got a hardcore sound but at the same time has it mellow highlightts. Mixed in with techno samplings, the songs keep the beat pumping. What 311 lacks in the rock department, Linkin Park takes it and will keep you jumping around. Lyrically this is an outstanding debut album. Every word comes out clear and crisp. All the new bands coming out are talented but Linkin Park is the one you'll be able to listen to over and over again. Just listening to the sound bites doesn't do this cd enough justice. Every song has it's own special sound. GO BUY THIS CD OR YOU'LL BE MISSING OUT.
0684853523|4.0|I've always considered Stephen King to be one of the great storytellers.  He knows when to let off, when to keep you hanging and how to move the story along.  I appreciate that he wrote a book like this because writing about how to write is a little like describing something which is indescribable. The memoir (the first part) is great.  He's so completely entertaining when describing such basic things that it makes you wonder what is or isn't fiction.  Doesn't matter because I was tickled all the while.  Don't discount the second part of the book either where he lets you in on all his creative secrets.  I found this part to be completely fascinating.  Very giving of him to let us in on all of this.  It's a little like Sharon Stone letting you in on all of her beauty secrets - the hair, the makeup, the diet - you know you may not use all of the tips but you know they're there, in case you feel like being fabulous.
B00004W3MS|5.0|What do you hear on this CD? Soaring melodies, an enchanting falsetto voice singing about things that you know must be important (but not a word in English), radio static, sonar pings, phase shifted notes from an accordion?, feedback from a bowed guitar, a volcano rumbling?, primal roars from ancient beasts (or it just the bass part?)...<br />When conventional arrangements of drums, bass, guitar and keyboard are used to back some catchy tunes, you're reminded that this is &quot;popular music&quot;. Just not like anything else on the pop charts today. If the Beatles had access to synthesizers while they were making Sgt. Pepper, and only released the more interesting, experimental pieces, maybe it would have sounded something like this.<br />With all the praise being heaped on Sigur Ros, you may wonder if this music is really deep and profound. Not the way Beethoven's late piano sonatas are. Is is brilliant, edging toward genius? Yes. Is it fun? YES. Listen and expand your musical horizons to the edge of the world.
0679731725|5.0|I first read 'The Remains of the Day' shortly after it came out. Since then, I have re-read it four times and recommended it to a dozen people (buying copies for half of them, so intent was I to share this joy). Each time, whether from re-reading it or discussing it with a friend, I learn something new about the book. For those who have read it, 'Stevens' (the narrator) is as much a real person as Holden Caufield in 'Cather and the Rye' - a friend.<br />First of all, it is a book that almost anyone can enjoy. You don't have to be an intellectual who loves to read 'deep' books (although if you are, you too will love it). The prose is simple enough, and yet also beautiful, and there is plenty of humour. And the plot idea is simple enough - a butler (Stevens) making a road trip across England in the 1950's to his former co-worker, the housekeeper Miss Kenton - whom he once shared some feelings with, albeit on a suppressed level, and whom he would now, at the remains of his day, see once again to see what happens.<br />Yet this book is also profoundly moving. As the story unfolds and we learn from Stevens more and more about his life and history, we become more and more deeply involved with him: his sense of duty, his attention to detail, his ideas about propriety and responsibility. He becomes for us a strange yet wonderful creature, and icon of an earlier age and yet still a mirror of ourselves.<br />From the first few lines to the silently crushing emotional finish, this is a book that casts a spell over the reader time and time again. Read it on the surface and it is beautiful; delve deeper and you can mine levels of meaning on war, human expression and repression, guilt, hope and love. The craftsmanship with which Ishiguro fashioned this masterpiece still amazes me; it is that work of art that goes beyond its craftsman. In my last reading I came across several more symbolic images I had missed earlier - the metaphors that Ishiguro is so fond of, existing on so manylevels. The book itself is a metaphor for life.
6304383827|5.0|I missed this movie when it was a New Release, because the descriptive blurb on the box calls it a &quot;comedy&quot; and doesn't even mention Jane Austen. I am so glad I finally discovered this movie! I've watched it twice, and enjoyed it exceedingly! I have a B.A. in English literature, and have always been a fan of Jane Austen. I have not seen the other version of this movie.<br />When  motivated to read through the novel again after watching this movie, I came to the conclusion that the movie is BETTER than the novel, in the sense that it eliminates a lot of Austen's excessive verbiage about all the fine details of interpersonal relationships. In other words, while this movie has some great dialogue (and yes, many of the best lines are taken verbatim from the novel),  it  is not overwhelmed by dialogue. This is a visual film, not too intellectual.<br />The actors who play Emma and Mr. Knightly are wonderful, great chemistry tother. I think that the buxom woman who plays Harriet gives a believeably youthful &amp; bashful performance.  The hypochondriac father is not overdrawn, and Jane Fairfax is played by a dark-eyebrowed woman with a slight resemblance to Liz Taylor.<br />The photography in this movie is OUTSTANDING. Some of the scenes I had to rewind to watch over again because they were so exquisitely lovely to look at. The various scenes are expertly transitioned, sometimes humorously, and this fluid movement from scene to scene in many ways reminds me of the filmmaking in the hit movie _Titanic_.<br />I fervently disagree with those who dislike this movie. This is an *excellent film* for Jane Austen fans. The romantic scenes at the end were a little sappy and stererotypical, but I cried and cried. It drew such emotional response.  It is such a moment of enlightenment when Emma figures out that Mr. Knightly is her husband of choice.  He is so subtle and English, and they are a perfectly matched couple. Watch this movie!!!
0060194995|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird, by Harper Lee.<br />  To Kill a mockingbird is a book that tells of two children growing up in times of racial segreation in a small southern town.  Thew childrens father who is a lawyer, is chosen to defend a black man on the charge of rape.   The main family, while not exactally rich live a middle class existance with a black house keeper in place of a mother who died before the story began.  The black man is accused by a young woman who is the oldest child in a large family.  Her family is the worst in town, het father is an acholic and her mother left her at a young age.  The story goes on to tell about the hardships of the blacks in the small town and of their white friends.    While that is the main plot of the book you are also told of the everyday lives and adventures of the two children and their best friend.  The book ends in a way that makes you think &quot;no thats not right, it's not supposed to happen that way.&quot;  But I will not give away the ending because that in my opinion was one of the best parts of the book.    I sincerely hope that you enjoyed my review and that if you already have not read the book that you will not delay in doing so.
B000002H2H|5.0|What a ground-breaking album this is!!  It never grows old.  This is one of my top-10 all-time favorite heavy metal albums.  Every song on this album is pure genius.  I have yet to meet someone who hates it.  Many people say &quot;Puppets&quot; is their best.  I feel this is really their greatest.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead are starting to remind me of Pink Floyd in that they can put out a brilliant album that blows everyone away and then follow it up with a completely different yet equally brilliant.  This could possibly be the boldest step music has taken in a long time, Radiohead have abandoned the verse-chorus hit song formula that all albums seem to have these days to instead make a lush, full piece that stands on its own as a work of art. For that alone Radiohead should be called visionaries.
0767805712|2.0|Whew!  Couldn't hardly stay awake in the middle of the day to finish this boredom classic.  Business suited astronauts huh?  If you're interested in seeing a society that should have been nuked, this is your group.  Flat, dull, boring non-personality's trying to go to outer space.  Even some good visual work doesn't help much.  Can you say &quot;bow-wow&quot;?
B000002GK1|5.0|This is the first in a trio of masterpieces that soundgarden produced befor its demise. This is also the one out of those three that retain the heavy metal aspect of the earlier soundgarden records (superunknown and down on the upside are more zeppelin).  You owe it to yourself to get this album as it really is a classic.
B00003CX6P|1.0|I'm usually a fan of Matt Damon's, but this movie goes beyond his ability to help.  This movie has nothing enjoyable in it.  It is just a closet manic-depressive bordering on psychotic committing crimes of necessity to continually cover up his crime of passion.  At no point does the movie throw any real twists or interest in.  I suppose it is somewhat of a decent commentary on how even a seemingly normal person can become a monstrosity of conscience, but as that it is well beyond my generous capability to enjoy.<br />Read Crime and Punishment if you want a story that really explores the depths of the dark side of human nature.  I didn't enjoy that one either, but at least it was intelligent.  This just gives you the darkness without the psychological exploration.
B000001DWG|5.0|Mother Love Bone is arguably the first great grunge group yet years later their music has transended that stereotype.  As all we have left of this great band this CD is a must-have.  If it weren't for Andrew Wood's passing MLB would  have become one of the greatest bands ever. At least there is comfort in the fact that something good came out of Wood's death, the amazing music of temple of the dog and pearl jam.  My favorite tracks are stargazer, crown of thorns, man of golden words, and stardog champion.

B000000993|5.0|This album is a must-buy. While lacking the scope and vision of Aenima, Undertow survives on its own merits.  There are only ten songs (69 total tracks, you'll see) but they are long enough that the total time of the CD is almost 70 minutes. &quot;Sober&quot; &quot;Swamp Song&quot; &quot;Crawl Away&quot; and &quot;Prison Sex&quot; are some of the best tracks that have been recorded.

B000002UJQ|5.0|There is nothing I can say about this album that hasn't been said before. The five-star average rating after more than 600 reviews speaks for itself.  Simply put this is one of the best albums ever, yes EVER. Try finding someone who disagrees.
B000002J27|5.0|Let's do justice to &quot;Robbery, Assault and Battery,&quot; a song which, despite numerous complaints, wonderfully displays the virtuoso talent of Genesis keyboardist Tony Banks. The lyrical content of &quot;Robbery, Assault and Battery&quot; is undoubtedly weaker than other songs on the album. Still, one cannot overlook the sophisticated electronic soundscape Banks creates. Does Banks' sythesizer/mellotron playing on &quot;Robbery, Assault and Battery&quot; sound campy or discordant? Hardly. With several brilliant keyboard riffs, &quot;Robbery, Assault and Battery&quot; shows Banks at his best. Let's be honest. Without Tony Banks, Genesis would have been lost in a fog of tuneless, folky art-rock (a la Yes' &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot;). Art-rock is hardly ever done right. But on &quot;Trick of the Tail,&quot; Genesis pulls it off in spades.
B000002GJH|5.0|This album is a one-time seattle supergroup album. Interestingly, at its release it was a combination of soundgarden and surviving mother love bone members and now it is all of pearl jam plus chris cornell. Dedicated to the late Andrew Wood you can feel the emotion and passion in these songs.  Quite simply this is some of the most amazing music produced in the 90's and if you should pick this one up immediately.
0783243499|4.0|Oh my gosh.  This was the most disturbing movie I have ever seen.  If you were disturbed by Natural Born Killers, then you ain't seen nothin'  yet.  I was in the theater laughing at things I felt horrible for laughing at.  I was laughing at a serial killer, and so was everyone else in the theater.  A guy sitting beside me said to me, &quot;I feel bad for laughing at this but I can't help it.&quot;  It was true, you couldn't. The movie was a social satire on the emphasis on materialism of the 80's.  It was about an investment banker, and his fellow collegues.  They would try to outdo each other in everything.  One of their favorite things to do was to compare business cards.  When someone would have a nicer card than Bateman, the main character, he would get one step closer to complete insanity.The first person he killed was a guy from work, whom he really didn't like.  He took him out for drinks, got him drunk, and then took him home.  When they got to Bateman's house, he had newspaper spread out all over the floor, with a chair with a sheet on it in the middle.  This is where the collegue sat down.  From that point you knew what was going to happen.  Bateman goes over to the CD player and puts on Huey Lewis and the News, Sports album, and then starts a running commentary on the band while Hip to be Square is playing, and while he is preparing to kill the guy.He goes into the kitchen, puts on a raincoat, and picks up an alluminum polished axe.  So shiny you could use it as a mirror for shaving.  He then walks into the room, and the guy asks him if that is a raincoat he is wearing.  He smiles and says yes.The guy then proceeds to ask him if that is an axe, and Bateman replies  pleasently, with a big grin on his face, &quot;Yes it is, and I'm going to kill you with it.&quot;He then proceeds to chop the guy up with Hip to Be Square playing in the background.  Then we all started laughing.  I don't know if it was because of the bizarness of the scene, or if it was genuinely funny to us.  Regardless, I think that everyone felt wrong about laughing at it.  He goes on to kill some other people in the same ways.  By that I mean that each murder has music playing in the background, and him giving the history of the performer.  It ends very strangely.I won't tell you how, because I recommend you watch it, if you are an adult, that isn't on the verge of going psychotic, because if you are, this one may be more of a documentary, than a work of fiction for you.THE GOODChristian Bale did an excellent job of playing this Bateman guy.  He really acted psychotic.  The story was interesting.  It was a story of a cry for help, and the way people who only care about status don't care about anything else.THE BADThat a movie can make you laugh at this kind of stuff.  I'm not sure if it is right to find this sort of thing humorus, but in the situation of this movie, I think the filmakers were trying to show the absurdity of the status issue.THE BOTTOM LINELike I said, definitely not for kids, but I reccommend you see it if you can handle it.  It is by far one of the weirdest movies I have ever seen.I'll give this one a B-.
B000002J0B|5.0|I am a huge zeppelin fan. Even this is not my favorite album (I havn't picked one they are all good) This album is amazing as all the others. It has the early light zep the later heavy zep. All mixed with great Jimmy solos. And then comes D'Yer Maker always awarding a smile. Just plain out excellent
B00003CX8I|5.0|X-men opened Friday.  Today is Sunday, and I have already seen it twice, and I'm going again Thursday.  If you think this is going to be a glowing review, you're DARN STRAIGHT!My expectations where off the charts for this movie.  I hate when I do that 'cause I usually get let down.  NOT IN THIS CASE!  IT EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS.  Everything was great about this movie.  The characters, the effects, and especially the story line.  It stayed true to everything I know about the X-Men, which isn't as much as some, and Wolverine, which I know quite a bit about.  What can I say I'm a bit of a Fan-Boy.  Heck I have a tatoo of Spider-Man on my arm.  By the way, if they screw up that movie, I'm gonna be pissed!The story revolves around Logan, or Wolverine, as he likes to be called, when he first comes in contact with the other mutants, or X-Men at Prof. Xaviers school for gifted youngsters.  He's a rebel. A cigar smokin', beer drinkin' , out of control SOB.But he is as cool as hell.  He has a metal skeleton, and metal claws that prorude from his knuckles when he gets pissed, and has to hurt someone.He is a wild man but, he has a soft side.  I don't want to get into it too much cause I don't want to give any of the movie away, so that's all I'm going to say about the plot.James Marsden does a great job of playing Cyclops, as do the rest of the cast in their roles.Here is a list.Femke Jansen.......................Jean GreyHal Berry................................StormAnna Paquin...........................RougePatrick Stewart........................Professor XSir Ian McKellan......................MagnetoTaylor Dane.............................SabertoothRay Park..................................ToadRebecca Romaijn Stamos........MystiqueBut the actor who is going to get the most attention from this movie is Hugh Jackman who plays Wolverine.   This guy was pretty much an unkownbut he played this part perfectly.  Just enough insanity along with heart.  He was Wolverine.Doug Ray Scott was supposed to do this part, but he had to do another little summer movie, which by the way is going to be crushed by X-Men, called Mission Impossible 2.  Which I won't see until it comes out on video, because car chases just don't thrill me that much.  He is going to be kicking himself for doing that instead of X-Men.It's only Sunday, and the totals are already up to 57million.  So they probably haven't even confirmed what it made today.The reason it's doing so well is not because of the F/X, it's because they actually, finally did a comic book movie right.They made the characters so you cared about what happened to them, and it wasn't just a bunch of senseless F/X.The two sides were actually fighting for something they believed in.  I WANT TO BE WOLVERINE!I'm going nuts I have to end this review.THE GOODI can't say enough good about this.  It's a great film you can take your whole family to see, and everyone from kids to adults will love it.THE BADYeah right!THE BOTTOM LINEIf you only see one film this summer, seriously, make this the one you see.  And see it more than once.  You'll enjoy the second time even more.  One other thing, go to a theater with good sound and picture quality.Overall I give this my highest rating A+.I liked it better than Green Mile, and Fight Club.
0679879269|5.0|I was surprised to see some of the poor reviews this book recieved. I was especially surprised to see the obligatory &quot;English teachers&quot; giving this book poor reviews due to the story being shallow with no character development etc. In fact, I think this book is very deep. Almost every great work of literature had a social, political, religious etc. alternate meaning to it. This work is no different. I was also surprised to see (once again) the English teachers who say that they will not make this book available to their students because of the criticism of an organized religion that is found within. Why should this book not be accepted, when those same teachers cover books such as the Crucible, Paradise Lost, and the other countless novels/books/plays that criticize one group or another. Stundents would not be taught anything if the teachers did not cover works with open (or subtle) jabs at a certain group. As for the surface appearance of the story, I thought it was a very good tale. Lyra and Will are explained in depth, and we are told more about their real character traits. We learn how they think, and how they act. New and interesting characters are introduced to replace the ones covered more in books 1 and 2. My final thought: Don't judge this book harshly because of its hostility towards a religion, and try to see from Pullman's point of you. Just enjoy the book for the story if you don't agree with Pullman's view of the world, and you won't be dissapointed. E-mail me if you have any comments.
B00003CXE6|5.0|This is going to be the first big hit of the spring/summer movie season.   It has all the makings.  Action, intrigue, romance, huge battle scenes, betrayal, vengence, and death.This was a good one.  Had a great cast.  Russel Crowe played Maximus.  A general,  turned prisoner, turned slave, turned gladiator, turned hero of the Roman Empire.  Richard Harris played the Roman Empereor whom  Maximus was a general under, and who was like the son, whom he wished his son was like.  Joiquan Phoenix, played the Emperors son who killed his father when he found out his father was going to make Maximus Emperor instead of him, and then he orders Maximus killed.Maximus gets away, but not in time to save his wife and son from being murdered by the same men he had been in control of when he was General.  He is sold into slavery, and becomes a Gladiator, and vows revevge on the new Emperor.Oliver Reed, in his final performance before his death, plays the owner of the Gladiators.  He agrees to give Maximus his freedom, if he can get the crowds to love him and see him as a hero.  This is how Maximus keeps the Emperor from killing him.  The Emperor will not kill him since he is so loved, 'cause that would make Maximus a martyr, so he has to find a way for the people to either hate him, or have him die &quot;fairly&quot; in the Gladiator ring.  That's all I'm going to tell about the story, because I don't want to give anything away.   This is one you need to see in the theater.  This picture is great.THE GOODThe acting, the sets, the cinemetography, the battle at the beginning was excellent, the fight scenes, the ending.THE BADNothing, though some people may not like the length.  But as I have said before, you're getting more for your money.THE BOTTOM LINEGreat movie.  Go see at least once if not more.  And definitely see it at least once in the theater.  The sets, and everything deserve to be watched on the big screen.  This is one both men and women can enjoy.  There are elements for both genders.I most definitely give this one an A+.
6305807043|5.0|The most unique movie I've ever seen in my whole entire life. I've never seen anything like it. I didn't know exactly what to think. But I'll tell you about it and maybe you can get something out of it.<br />A puppeteer named Craig Schwartz (John Cusack, who's great as always)gets a job in a business building on the 7 1/2 floor. He confides in the very tempting coworker Maxine (Catherine Keener) who shrugs him off thinking he's a loser. After finding a port hole in the mind of actor John Malkovich, Craig gets Maxine into his schence to let others in to Malkovich for $200 a trip. Craig's frizzy haired animal loving wife (played by Cameron Diaz, you can barely notice her in this great role) wants to go back in Malkovich more than once and likes the idea of being a man, and decides she wants a sex change and falls for Maxine, who Craig fancies. Hence, chaos, Maxine falls for Craig's wife, Lodi, but will only have relations with her through Malkovich. <br />This movie is the most original film of the year. I think the message in this film, at least for me was that we should be happy with are and not hold other people above us and just be happy with what we have and who we are. Because if you try and be someone else you'll end up like Craig Schwartz....(see the movie)<br />This movie has a wonderful supporting cast featuring Orson Bean, Mary Kay Place, Charlie Sheen, and cameo appearances by Sean Penn, Andy Dick, Gary Sinise, Winona Ryder and many more. But look quick, they don't pop! out at you. All in all it's a great film with some good points, some funny scenes and NEVER a loss of energy. It just keeps going and by the end you want more, which I think is a good element in film. Leave the audience wanting more......
B00004RFCM|5.0|Whether you've seen the series before on HBO or not, this DVD is sure to engross you. Finally a show that is right on target with regards to female sexuality! Sex and the City features intelligent, humorous, and (most importantly) realistic dialogue on all sorts of sexuality and romance themes.<br />The writers of Sex and the City are gutsy enough to tackle controversial yet incredibly relevant topics that urban women really discuss - such as threesomes and masturbation. Amid all of the girl talk, relationships form and dissolve - creating often romantic and bittersweet episodes.<br />Sarah Jessica Parker is cute as ever, with a smart New Yorky edge. Her co-stars are talented actresses in their own right, and they seem like real women - both in looks and personality.<br />One small warning - this DVD can be addictive. I stayed up all night watching it the first night after I bought it!
0449002632|4.0|A 2000 year history of London using a group of family-trees as the device by which the story is told. The quibble: As the cast-list and the geography of London is paramount to the enjoyment and understanding of this book I reckon a better series of maps and a clearer (fold-out?) family tree would have been a good idea. The praise: A thoroughly entertaining ride through Roman London, a succession of Royals, Chaucer and Dick Whittington, Fire, Plague, Reformation and we have not reached Victorian England yet! Each portion of history is relayed in the context of the characters that form a lineage throughout the 1000+ pages. For someone without too good a grasp of historical dates this really aids understanding of the events. A criticism levelled at the book is that the vignettes are (by definition) too brief. However, what else could Rutherford do? Write a 3000-page house brick?! In summary this book is easily digestible, educational and - thankfully- a superb read.
B00003Q43A|1.0|Honestly, I think that watching a toilet flush for 2 hours would be more entertaining than this film.  That they were able to finance and create it in the first place amazes me, and the reception at the box office undermines my faith in the American public to a great degree.  And now a DVD!?  Please put this one in a coffin instead.
B00004WGAI|5.0|I have watched all the Jane Eyre movies and have read and re-read the book over the last 30 years.<br />This version is the best.  The chemistry between Dalton and Clarke is wonderful.  The words from the book come to life when spoken by these actors.<br />I loved the scenery and found the music just the right background noise for the beautiful language that just springs to life here.<br />Watch the other versions, this is the one you'll want to buy and watch over and over again - if you can tear yourself away from the book.
B00000IAU3|5.0|when i got this cd- i had already heard 'here with me' and 'dont think of me' but it wasnt until i heard 'thank you' when i was watching 'sliding door's when i realized wow this girl is good! the song gave me goosebumps- so i thought i would purhcase the cd- and figured i would end up skipping some tracks- but i have to say that Dido is one of the cd's i have which i will allow to play in its entirety. Highly recommend it- great cd to chill out and relax too. Hope she comes out with some more stuff.
B000002NHN|4.0|For those of you who have purchased Loreena McKennit's other albums, such as &quot;The Mask and Mirror&quot; and &quot;To Drive the Cold Winter Away&quot;, some of you might have found that they have a comparatively more subdued tone. While some enjoyed the subtlety, others - like me - would have felt that Loreena could have pushed that extra mile to make her music more appealing.<br />A converse to the above equals the beauty of this album. In fact, &quot;The Book of Secrets&quot; sounds hardly Irish at all; it actually sounds more oriental. Though with only eight tracks, every one is painstakingly long (this is where she LITERALLY knows not time) and evidently shows the effort put into composing every piece.<br />The &quot;Prologue&quot; starts out with that familiar restrained sound: Very nice and mystical, but you get that urgent feel of wanting something to suddenly burst out and surprise you. That's where the excitement of &quot;The Mummer's Dance&quot; comes in. From the start to the very end, heavily rhythmic percussion and a dreamy tune take you on a lively journey through the eyes of a traditional street performer. Though six minutes long, you'd actually wish it could continue on more.<br />Then things take a more sombre turn in &quot;Skellig&quot;, whose poignancy doesn't slump back on weepy boredom, but instead charms wonderfully with its slow, soothing sound. Then yet another surprise awaits in &quot;Marco Polo&quot;, which turns out irresistibly catchy (don't worry - I haven't spoilt it for you: The beats are INDESCRIBABLE!).<br />Follwing which comes &quot;The Highwayman&quot;, which might initially not appeal too much due to its length (about eleven minutes - told you she knew not time!). Perhaps it was because of the restraint of the original poetic verses that made Loreena's melody unimpressive, yet it somehow fits to match the very tragic tale. So, listening to it several times would get you in the swing of it. This precedes &quot;La Serenissima&quot;, which boasts the true essence of New Age Music with the hypnotic strings of a harp.<br />Sadly, &quot;The Book of Secrets&quot; comes with a not-so-befitting conclusion. &quot;Night Across the Caucasus&quot; simply recombines &quot;Skellig&quot; and &quot;La Serenissima&quot; to bring out a relatively monotonous song. &quot;Dante's Prayer&quot; is, again, sad, and beautiful in its own way, but it makes an unsuitable ending for such a lively album.<br />Still, though Loreena literally knows not time, she doesn't in a metaphoric sense too, in that there are really no boundaries to the versatility of her music. If she could record yet another album that relives the magic of &quot;The Book of Secrets&quot;, it'll be a sure winner.
B00004YM0D|4.0|Your kids will love this flick and you, dear parent, will adore it.  If you are a product of the early 70's, the situation will remind you of awful times past. It will also enforce the value and rewards of an open mind and a willingness to give others a chance.  The music  - magnificantly chosen from the long litany of 70's greats - just might inspire you to take to the aisle and dance your heart out.  However, because you have taken your kids to the movies, you know you can't do this (besides they probably have a friend or two with them and you don't want to totally embarass your kid, not to mention yourself).  You will undoubtedly make a mental note to put this CD on your Christmas list. And well you should.   Your kids will enjoy this movie. There is action indeed (albeit football) and lots of funny situations.  Additonally it will make for lots of dinner conversations and will probably change the way you and your kids watch a weekend football game.  You ALL might just get up and dance when you play it at home - yahoooo!   Enjoy and shake a leg!
B000021XR5|5.0|Despite coming out of decade that was pretty low on rock, I think STP may be one of the best rock bands of all time.....and No.4 is the perfect justification for that.  <br />They found a way to combine the melodic elements of album #3 (&quot;Tiny Music...&quot;) with the heaviness of the first one (&quot;Core&quot;)....<br />Try NOT singing with &quot;Sour Girl&quot; or &quot;Atlanta&quot;....try NOT getting completely charged up by &quot;Heaven and Hotrods&quot; or &quot;No Way Out&quot;.....it's almost impossible.....And &quot;Down&quot; is just as HEAVY as anything STP did on &quot;Core,&quot; eight years ago!<br />I was afraid that it might have been the end of STP when Scott did his solo thing, and the other members did Talk Show....if anything, those experiences seem to have made the band that much stronger musically!
B00004YW6I|4.0|This may be remembered as Polly Harvey's coming-of-age album.  I love everything she's done and have admired her cajones since I first heard &quot;50 Ft Queenie&quot; way back when, but this new album is a real turning point.  After dabbling in garage rock (&quot;Dry&quot;), grunge rock (&quot;Rid of Me&quot;), electronica (&quot;Is This Desire?&quot;), and everthing else (&quot;To Bring You My Love&quot;), she's ditched the studio musicians and uber-producers (i.e. Flood and Steve Albini), and made a wonderfully understated rock-and-roll album that's all her.  Get it (along with all her other ones)!
B00003CXDG|4.0|M:I-2 is a pure visually feast.  If you expect just an action movie, you are going to get a whole lot more.  There's emotion to this story.  Considering the fact that the basic plot is a homage to the movie &quot;Notorious&quot; directed by Alfred Hitchcock. So just pop the movie in and sit back and enjoy...just don't think.
B000002UAO|5.0|Aside from the White Album it is the best Beatles album. Recorded during their transition from a pop group to a rock band, it has some beautiful ballads and great folk-rock tunes. This is one is all Lennon. McCartney has a couple of great songs on here. Drive My Car is a great rock song and Michelle is a gourgeous ballad. Harrison writes his first ever Beatles songs with Think For Yourself and If I Need Someone, both very good tunes. But it's the Lennon sung songs which make this album so great, most notably In My Life, Norwegian Wood, Nowhere Man, and Girl . Quite possibly their very best lyrical and vocal album, this is a brillant masterpiece masterpiece
B000001G89|5.0|The voice of Teresa Berganza is one of the wonders of the age, if forced to choose, I would say it's the most beautiful voice I have ever heard. But the great Spanish mezzo is far more than just beautiful sounds, she goes deep into the characters she sings, and brings magic to her Carmen. She was wise to wait until she was 40 to sing and record this role, the voice was at its very best in the mid 70's, and she sings even the more dramatic passages with ease and conviction. In my book there is no better Carmen than she, Victoria de los Angeles would come in second place, but of course, her portrayal wouldn't have been possible on stage. Placido Domingo was born to sing Don Jose, and Sherrill Milnes is a very good and sonorous Escamillo. But it is the magnificent conducting of Claudio Abbado which leaves me speechless. He understands better than anyone else this miraculous score, he draws gorgeous sounds from the LSO and builds the drama inexorably. This is one of the truly GREAT opera recordings of the century
B000002UB3|5.0|This was the last album the Beatles recorded before their break up. It's also one of their best. It opens with the best song on the album, Come Together. Lennon writes some of the best and most confusing lyrics ever penned in a rock song. McCartney plays some great bass lines and Ringo's drumming is surprisingly very good. The next song, George's Something is absolutely beautiful. Harrison shows his genius songwriting again with Here Comes the Sun. Great harmonies between Harrison and McCartney on that one. Because and Oh Darling are pure Lennon genius. His vocals are superb on both songs. You Never Give Me Your Money is another great song. I Want You (She's So Heavy) is a blues-rock jam with Harrison and Lennon just cutting loose on guitars. Even Maxwell's Silver Hammer and Octupus's Garden are likeable songs, despite their goofyness. The second half of the album is a part rock-opera and see the Beatles commmenting on stories in the news at that time.... This album rocks very hard and is very enjoyable from start to finish.
6304626495|5.0|This has got to be among the all time classics. &quot;Blessed are the Greek, for they will inherit the Earth&quot;, &quot;I have a fwiend called Bigus Dickus&quot; and &quot;You were led here by a bottle more like&quot;, these are what one-liners are all about. In many ways not as good as the Holy Grail, but in many ways better. If you like comedy and you are not strictly religious or easily offended, then you will laugh and laugh untill that wet feeling occurs below the equator.
0345410025|5.0|I have a terrible memory.  Can't remember names or directions.  After only reading chapter one, I went out to a Monday Night Football party and left remembering the first and last names of all 8 people I met.  It was great to be able to call someone by their name instead of &quot;hey pal&quot;.  I descibed the methods to my wife (Using the &quot;keyword&quot; &amp; &quot;linking&quot; concepts I can go through the book chapter by chapter from memory) she thinks they sound hokey.  But it's been the best $10 I ever spent.
B000002BYA|5.0|I own all Stevies official cds and some &quot;non&quot; official ones but this is IT! If anybody had any doubts about his prowess on the guitar this recording lays those doubts to rest. Stevie Ray simply burns on this disc . The addition of Roomful Of Blues horns serves to make the music more powerful - check out Iced Over for example. There are too many highlights to mention but Scuttle Buttin is amazing and technically brilliant! COD is interesting too with Angela Strehli making a guest appearance on vocals. How did the Carnegie Hall cope with the screaming volume of Stevie Ray's strat - buy this disc and be amazed at the sound quality. In my opinion this is the best live album recorded - even better than Live At The Regal and Luther A's Live in Chicago.
0783113943|5.0|Angelina Jolie gives a genuine, absolutely heart-wrenching performance as Gia Carangi, supermodel. She portrays Gia's transition from a teenager to a supermodel struggling through issues including, but not limited to drugs, the fashion world, AIDS, and the general search for someone who truly cares. Although Angelina Jolie has suggested that her performance is &quot;upstaged by her breasts&quot; in this film, I disagree. She gives us a solid, three-dimensional look into the life of a woman who rode extreme highs and lows and was rarely in between. You will not be disappointed by her amazing (and award-winning) performance in Gia.

B00000IQUT|3.0|Upon its initial release, &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; was made out to be an utterly worthless, pro-rape film by overly PC critics who feared their reputation would be tarnished if they admitted fanfare for this disturbing and competently made movie.<br />But that's not to say it's not without its problems.  Writer-director Meir Zarchi, obviously under the influence of Wes Craven's gritty &quot;Last House on the Left,&quot; constructed a very simple plot where a beautiful woman is isolated only to be beaten and raped by a gang of local hoods.  After they leave her for dead, she recuperates and takes sadistic revenge against her attackers.<br />The rape scenes are too choreographed to be considered realistic, and this is complemented by camera angles that render the incidents voyeuristic.  The heroine has no discernible personality aside from her looks, and is a model of perfection that is violated unfairly.  The way the rapists are seduced and buy the fact that this woman could be attracted to them after the fact is just preposterous.  And the movie ends on a note of absolute nihilism.<br />But I think Zarchi wanted to make an example of men, and how they allow their privates to do their thinking for them.  So the way the rapists' libidoes lead them to their doom is a bit symbolic. The act of revenge that takes place in the third act is mean-spirited, unpleasant, but honest.  After all, revenge is a hollow act that isn't intended to bring about a feeling of pleasure.<br />&quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; is a decent film.  I give it an extra star because of the recent Anchor Bay remaster that has an excellent picture and sound.
B00000K0DU|3.0|Okay, let's try to remember a time when slasher movies weren't so en vogue that Hollywood cranked out a new one every week.  Let's try to remember a time when every slasher movie DIDN'T have a fresh, artificially pretty teenage hunk/starlet in the lead role.  Let's remember that Fulci was one of the most underrated Italian horror directors out there, and his work was often misunderstood by the masses.<br />&quot;The New York Ripper&quot; is a slasher film that--upon initial inspection--is mean-spirited, very violent, and misogynistic.  But if you view it few times, the plot becomes clearer and the film feels less contrived.  The story is quite simple--psycho killer stalks and kills pretty girls--but there are many complicated details and subtle clues that make the slasher's identity a mystery up until the end.<br />Out of all Fulci's films, this one probably has the most unsettling violence, and there are spots where things drag a bit.  But stick with it, and you'll be able to recall a time when slasher films--and horror movies in general--were much more daring than they are now.
0452281881|3.0|a few pages into this book (which consists entirely of emails between people at a london ad agency) i was wondering where the first laugh was going to come from. the ad business stereotyping is so excessive and the humour so recycled that there's scarcely a word that comes as any surprise. however, as i continued reading i became curiously entranced by the trivial goings-on and ritual backstabbings among the uniformly loathesome characters in the book. beaumont has hit upon such an easily readable format, and a way to allow new twists and plot turns (predictable though they may be) to come extremely thick and fast. &quot;e&quot; goes from being an irritating assault on what everybody thinks ad people are like (some are, but not all) to a fast paced, oddly addictive time-passer. if you're looking for a searing insight into the inner machinations of the ad business, go work at an agency. if you have a few hours to kill, &quot;e&quot; will pass them for you. but don't expect to learn anything. someday soon, somebody (not beaumont) will write the first e-masterpiece. i get the sense that beaumont is not a real writer, but somebody who had an idea and managed to get it down on paper before it went away. don't expect to hear from beamont again. this is a definite one-hit wonder.
B000002MP2|3.0|this is good, but i liked nimrod much better
B00004Z459|4.0|The one reason this cd doesnt receive 5 stars is because it is a pitiful 39 minutes long which just makes me feel like i wasted my  money. If this cd could atleast be an average length, maybe 42 minutes or more, it would get the 5 stars. This is a very talented band also. They are like Crazy Town but with a singer as well as a rapper which I fell is 10 times better. The two best songs on the cd are the first two, &quot;Papercut&quot; and &quot;One Step Closer.&quot; I feel that &quot;Papercut&quot; is actually one of the best songs I have heard in the last year or two. It begins with a hard rock rap beginning, and then flows right into a nice, harmonized part which could actually be called beautiful, it actually put a smile on my face and only 3 songs have ever done that. (Metallica - Memory Remains S &amp; M version, Eve 6 - Promise, Linkin Park - Papercut) If you have the money, buy this cd and let it bring a smile to your face. If you don't, save up money when buying a 39 minute cd doesnt bother you.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead is a group constantly in evolution, challenging it's listeners everytime by pushing the artistic envelope with every album. With &quot;Pablo Honey,&quot; you had a band that was using friendly pop songs with the indie-grunge sound of the early '90s. &quot;The Bends&quot; took it a step further, with the exploration of the 'concept album,' emphasizing the keyboards more and using the beats and the guitars to truely start to create an atmosphere. &quot;OK Computer&quot;  entered Roxy Music/Pink Floyd territory, exploring more of that mysterious spacey air with a cartload of heavy guitars. What set &quot;OK Computer&quot; apart from every other Radiohead album is that it brought about an overall theme through Yorke's vocals--slow, quiet desperation at an over-materialistic world where work was literally killing you.<br /> But &quot;Kid A&quot; is entirely different, smoothed with techno groves that would make you think of Aphex Twin or Kraftwork, then covered with a sheet of Pink Floyd. But with the slow, almost sometimes quiet mood of the songs, Yorke and crew give you an entirely new message on this album--Surrender. The angst of &quot;OK Computer&quot; is gone forever, replaced with a sense of slow decay, not giving a damn about the world anymore.<br /> Songs like &quot;Everything in it's Right Place,&quot; gives you a good example, with simple electronic keyboards driving a continous note with little pause; Yorke's fractured vocals, saying &quot;Everything...Everything...Everything...&quot; cry out in muted sadness continuously, interupted by a record stopping and going, leaving him to sing out of tune terribly. The next song--the title track--with its simple, lonely lullabyish keys, sounds like one thinking of their childhood, yearning for a long-gone innocence when things weren't so clear<br /> I have to agree that &quot;Optimistic&quot; is the most up-front and radio-friendly track on this album, since all the other songs are too sonically different and by far out of place on modern-rock radio. But in my opinion, &quot;Kid A&quot;'s best achievement is &quot;How to Disappear Completely.&quot; I don't know how to decribe it, other than it's brilliant! Yorke's lonely vocals set back against an accoustic guitar and eerie keyboards can make anyone's hair stand up. <br /> The song also fits into much of the album's artwork, where a faintly drawn scene of a post-apocolyptic office hallway shows, covered with icey cave-like stalagmites. It's the complete opposite of &quot;OK Computer.&quot; Instead of the imagery of endless, inhuman, windowless cubicles, circled by a world where people work and live like corporate drones, we have a place where everything has come to pass. The companies are gone, the workers have disappeared, and the world that they used to inhabit is decaying. &quot;This isn't happening,&quot; Yorke sings chillingly<br /> Of all the descriptions of this album, it can be quickly summed up as an album that breaks the commercial barriers of pop and returns it to anti-pop. Instead of 'N Sync dancing around with plastic smiles or Limp Bizkit moshing and being angry about nothing, Radiohead is a group with purpose, bringing fans with them on a journey where neither knows where it's going.
0393317552|4.0|An excellent text.<br />In one compelling volume, the famous biologist Jared Diamond tackles the most important question of global history: Why did Europeans come to dominate the New World? <br />This question has been answered by others before; Diamond's idea that Europe's geography is the cause (&quot;geographical determinism&quot;) has also been proposed before. Any student of history can drag up a case or two of this thesis. Baron Montaigne, for example, proposed that Europe's primacy stemmed from its superior government, which could be derived directly from the coolness of its climate.<br />The deep significance of this book is that Diamond's thesis is not simply idle speculation. He proves that the Eurasian land mass had by far the best biological resources with which to develop agricultural societies, and was thus more able to form large, coherent, and powerful social entities.<br />To support this idea, Diamond introduces thorough set of well-researched data on what kinds of plants and animals are necessary to support a farming society. He investigates the biological resources available to potential farmers in all parts of the world. The people of Eurasia had access to a suite of plants and animals that provided for their needs. Potential farmers in other parts of the world didn't-- and so their fertile soil went untilled. <br />After establishing this strong foundation, Diamond falls into repeating ideas about the formation of large-scale societies. These ideas, while unoriginal, are still compelling, and Diamond presents them in a very clear and well-written way.<br />His other major original contribution comes when he discusses the diseases that helped the Old World conquer the New. Building on his earlier chapters dealing with Old-World domesticated animals, he shows that these very animals were the sources of the major plagues (such as smallpox) which virtually annihilated New World populations. The fact that Old Worlders had immunities to these diseases was a direct result of their agricultural head-start.
0805062971|5.0|I didn't.  I really wish I had because by seeing the movie i knew many of the surprises that the book had in store for me.  You will be much better off if you go in as a blank slate.  This book is a memorable experience, and it is definetely worth a read.  It is really written more allegorically than literally, and it's characters aren't completely plausible, but it all fits together perfectly.  While it's meager size (208 pages) makes for a quick read, it is a difficult book to just blast through due to its dark and gritty ideas.  On the other hand, it is equally difficult to put it down, so you will likely find yourself finishing it rather rapidly.  Unless you've seen the movie, it will likely take a couple of readings to get a handle on all the nuances of the story.<br />Unless you hated the movie, or particularly squeemish, then this book is a keeper.
0451169514|5.0|There is no question...King is the best.  This is one of my favorite books by King.  I've tried other horror writers just to get a variety, but I've realized that there is no substitute for the best.  Involved character histories, suspense, ultimate story telling.
0553277472|4.0|I find it really hard to be objective about this  book. Let me explain: I read &quot;Zen...&quot; when I was 22. It was time in my life when I needed new ideas, even a new way of thinking, if you like. And that is what I loved about this book. For me, it is the story of someone brave enough to follow their own thoughts and actually do something NEW! It contains what, for me, was a wealth of new ideas and the connection of many thoughts I had already had into a broader, deeper picture. Ideas old, new, Eastern and Western all find there place here.<br />Before reading this, my impression of philosophy was a lot of old men arguing about the exact definitions of words. After reading, I became aware of what philosophy should be - the quest to advance human knowledge! For me, this book manages to impart some of the great excitement and adventure of this quest.<br />But then there is the down side. I still believe that philosophy  is strange subject, that to study it is a contradiction in terms. Someone who is involved in the discovery of new ideas is what I would call a 'philosopher', rather than those who generally go by that name.<br />But this is not a philosophy text book. The conclusions drawn are probably not very profound or useful for developing a better world. But it is a very good read, on several levels, and very well written. I found it inspiring and thought provoking, even if you do not necessarily agree with the conclusions. This is where I am being subjective. I just found it so exciting that there are people out there chasing new ideas and challenging old ones, that the actual central argument of the book, on the role of quality in life, seemed almost secondary. <br />Still, it has been three years since the first reading. I feel this review has not, and indeed could not express the profound effect this book had on me at the time. Maybe now I should return and be inspired once more!
B000002KGT|5.0|The Beatles' early work was inspired by Chuck Berry. Years later, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was inspired by Brian Wilson's &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, then came &quot;The White Album&quot; and &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, inspired by a number of artists of the time, including Hendrix and Clapton. If the Beatles had continued to exist in 1975, &quot;Rumours&quot; would have been another inspiration.  It's that simple. The male/female combination of Buckingham/Nicks has never been surpassed, and this album is the cornerstone of their achievement. 10-stars!
B000002N2P|4.0|If you're a fan, you'll enjoy this disk.  They are going back to their roots with this recording.  You'll hear influences from the late 70's/early 80's punk scene but not as much as on Nimrod.  Great Christmas choice.
0807281956|5.0|One may think that the world has been bewitched by Rowling. I for one, was not interested in reading the series. But after many pleas from my fellow readers, I picked it up. I could not put it down. I along with the rest of the people in the world who have read it, am bewitched. It is a wonderous book, filled with excitement! I would definately not cast this is a &quot;Kids Only&quot; book. Rowling's writing allows the story to progress at a natural pace, with a very moving climax. After you read it, you want more. Some people have said that this book is not good, and there is too many hate themes...I say that it is about being a kid and having adventures. It is about friendship, pain, excitement,  horror...some things every kid and adult knows about. <br />Each character has his or her own flaws and is not perfect, even Harry. But they are all likeable, especially when working together. It shows the power of the friendship between them. I have also heard that there is not a likeable person in the book, that you can't relate or what not. How untrue! I feel just like Harry, and can relate to Ron. I believe everyone relates to one character or another...even those who say they don't. <br />Rowling's writing has changed me into a definate Potterite! And what a wonderful feeling it is.
B000002MP2|3.0|Great choice to start you off enjoying Green Day but if you really want an outstanding effort check out Nimrod.  It's their best to date.
B00000K2SC|5.0|I swear, if you haven't seen The Matrix yet, the run to the local Blockbuster and rent it. Even better, buy it right now! This is by far the greatest special effects, mind boggling movie of all time! Superbly acted and edited, I completely understand why it won a few Academy Awards, but I can't remember how many or what for. This is a definite must-see.
B00003CXGG|1.0|It begins with phony martial arts in a ghetto atmosphere of profanity (and not just the movie, I felt like letting a few words fly after paying for this!) and crummy dialogue. Then my finger hit the fast-forward button more times than my heart was beating.<br />I wasn't asking for much. All I wanted was a movie along the lines of Van Damme. Some martial arts action with a semi-decent story. Instead I was so bored, especially with the ridiculous fight scenes (defying the laws of physics and common sense) and awful dialogue and story. <br />This movie should be listed as fantasy. Howard the Duck was more believable than this thing. <br />If you wanted to see realistic martial arts, you should've been at my house when I did the Crane as I was about to kick my TV in while this horrendous movie was playing.
0780625129|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Edward Norton and Edward Furlong give an allstar performance in this chilling tale about the consequences of racism. A skin head named Derek is put in jail for brutally killing two black guys who are trying to steal his car (this was my favorite part of the movie). After a very rough prison life, he is released (no longer a racist) only to find that his little brother Danny is following in his footsteps. It is a great movie.
0684853523|4.0|This book is for writers, readers and fans.  For writers, King's advice is to \\"just do it\\", including your homework, and encourages us to BE writers by assuming the disciplined position of writing:  create your space, lock in your time, brush up on your grammar and write write write. For readers, here's some bio on this private celeb we've come to know only through his fiction.  No surprises:  here's his rapid sneak-up-on-you style, and through it we recognize ol' Steve on every page. For fans, King has extracted tidbits from the mind from which his books were mined and given us some personal gems.  The anecdote on page 30 is worth the price of the book... I read it on a flight from Atlanta to SFO and laughed until I cried.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Slipnot has to be my most favorite band in the whole wide world. The lyrics are cool, the concerts are cool, and the masks are cool. Jim and Mick really know how to play the guitar. Sid is by far the BEST DJ I've ever heard. Joey, Chris, and Shawn are the best drummers. Paul is a great bassist. Craig is the best sampler. And Cory, my favorite member of the band, does the best vocals I have ever heard. He can go from screaming to singing to whispering to screaming again and still make the music sound good. I HIGHLY recommend Slipknot to anyone.
6305603847|4.0|I was a Pink Floyd fan throughout my younger years, but The Wall to me is still one of the most wonderfully well-produced albums of all time. I must have seen this film in the theater over 20 times during my high school years.  And now, seeing and hearing this film on DVD has 'remastered' my appreciation for this entertaining visual and audio experience.  At first sight, the graphics work on the package and the disc itself is attractive.  the animated flowers are beautifully portrayed on the disc.  The inner pamphlet is a simple mini poster, with movie and DVD credits.  I was hoping for a little more to read, but I guess not this time.  I popped the DVD into my player and was immediately introduced to the main menu. You have 4 choices....the movie, the extra features, scene/song selection and audio selection. Let's first talk about the audio selection, titled &quot;Set The Controls&quot;.  You have a choice of 5.1 surround and PCM stereo surround.  **TECHNICAL NOTE-If your DVD player has 3D sound enhancement, you must turn this off for this disc.  Having that feature on will lower the sound quality from this disc** You also have a &quot;system set up&quot; choice.  It gives you specific sound tests and directions on volume and surround elements.  A nice addition, kind of like the THX optimode on other discs, but slightly different.  The next menu button is titled &quot;Any Title You Like&quot;.  Under this, you get to choose subtitles if you wish.  Your choices are Spanish, French or English.  You get to choose scenes by song, of course.  Unfortunately, these choices are only numbered, there are no descriptions of the scene or the song.  So, it may take a few tries to find an individual scene.  You also have a choice to watch the film with the song lyrics below the picture.  This is pretty cool. It reminded me of those &quot;Pink Floyd Karaoke Parties&quot; that I never went to!  Anyway, it would probably be taken more seriously to those not too familiar with the lyrics.  The final button, titled &quot;A Soucerful of Features&quot;, contain all the supplemental material.  You have your choice of two documentaries, titled &quot;The Other Side&quot;, &quot;Retro Part One&quot;, and &quot;Retro Part Two&quot;.  &quot;The Other Side&quot; is a piece produced around the time The Wall was released, and it's great to watch.  There is a lot of behind the scenes footage.  &quot;Retro Part One and Two&quot; are recent documentaires containing rather new interviews with Roger Waters, Alan Parker and others who worked on the film.  Both of these documentaires are fascinating because it is well known (to fans), that Roger and Alan had very different views as to what the film is about! A lot of behind the scenes stories and information.  They are put together very well and a pleasure to watch!  You also have the choice of watching the film with commentary by Roger Waters and Gerald Scarfe (animation).  These commentaries have great behind the scenes information throughout the film.  Roger Waters is especially a pleasure to listen to because he laughs (which is rare), and he gives the commentary a more personal experience since the film is semi-autobiographical.  He even mentions a story about Syd Barrett (the founder of Pink Floyd).  This commentary is outstanding.  The final piece of supplemental material is when you click a button titled &quot;Oddities&quot;.  These pieces of supplemental material include the trailer, photographs from the movie set, paintings from the film, a music video of &quot;Another Brick in the Wall-Part 2&quot;, and a sequence of the song &quot;Hey You&quot; that was not in the final cut of The Wall.  That's all the supplemental material...well worth it too!  The only two complaints I have are these buttons that you can press that give you 10 second sound bites from the film, and the slowness of the menus.  After you select something, you need to watch 10 seconds of video before you are allowed to make your next choice. Menu design and graphics is pretty good, but should be MUCH faster. OK, so I watched the film and the high definition transfer is incredibly beautiful.  Colors are deeply saturated with a sharp picture and wonderful clarity.  The transfer is very impressive! Sound quality is a mixed bag.  The production track sounds dated, not too much range but not at all annoying, just noticeable.  The music is unbelievable!  The soundtrack was remastered from the ORIGINAL MASTER TAPES.  If you've never heard The Wall on a surround sound system, you are in for a big treat.  The music sounds almost perfect, with some hiss, but nothing to complain about.  There were times I heard instruments that I didn't remember from the album....incredibly clear, wonderfully recorded music.  I can't say enough about the musical soundtrack, it comes alive on DVD.  Pink Floyd never sounded better! In conclusion, I recommend this DVD to EVERY Pink Floyd fan, and to those who want to hear a unique, musical experience and watch a beautifully photographed film.  I must add that the animation is absolutely wonderful.  Gerald Scarfe has included his great creativity throughout the film!  The disc loses points ONLY for its slow menu navigation.  Other then that, Pink Floyds The Wall on DVD is wonderful.  Tons of extra footage, a beautiful transfer and unbelievable sounding music.  A great DVD to own whether you live inside or outside the wall!  Enjoy!
0140177396|5.0|When I read this book I was twelve and I loved it.  I still do.  It is a compelling, heart-warming story, although the ending is quite sad.  I recommend it to anyone who likes classic novels.  It's one of those books that keeps you thinking about the story days after you've finished it.
0553269631|5.0|The Heart is a Lonely Hunter embodies the many, very humane emotions everyone experiences. The broad title suggests that everyone searches but can find no truly fulfilling thing to live for in life. I think Carson McCullers realized the frivolity of life. I don't see how anyone that has nothing to live for save another person can go on, honestly.  People die, and they are gone. They have let you down. God never changes. Man needs God and his existence is the only explanation for the innate sense of value that we all have above the animals.
B0000057C5|5.0|After hearing &quot;Du Hast&quot; a few times, I knew I had to get this album! Till's vocals, Chris' drums, and all the amazing tech, make this one of the coolest foreign language albums ou there. And don't worry if you don't speak a word of German, hard-n-heavy industrial rock is the same no matter what language it's in. Tracks like &quot;Tier&quot; lend themselves to a more american feel. And &quot;Du Hast&quot; just rips it up! So stop reading this and go buy this album! NOW!
B00000K0DT|5.0|These young, bright, and talented filmmakers, McQuarrie, Singer and cast, filmed a story that holds your attention for 122 minutes, keeps you guessing even after the end,  and provokes the audience to reflect.  There's also the superb  cinematography of Sigel and crafty editing by Ottman.<br />Isn't THIS the definition of &quot;art&quot;?<br />The Usual Suspects deserved awards for Best Film.
0805062971|4.0|I was a big fan of the movie Fight Club and was very interested in seeing how the book stacked up against the movie.  Was this like most books which wind up being poorly translated, or was the movie a fair representation of Palahniuk's original novel?<br />It turns out that the movie is a very faithful reproduction of the book.  Many scenes are taken out of the book wholesale, and a number of the narrations done by Ed Norton are taken word for word out of the text.  This being said, the book was very much worth the read, and the character development is a little bit more in depth, as books tend to do.<br />There were several areas that were different between the movie and the book, as outlined below (no plot spoilers, so feel free to read away):<br />1. Marla's mother.<br />2. The main character's interactions with his boss.<br />3. The investigation into the destruction of the main character's condo.<br />4. The garden at the Paper Street house.<br />5. The action leading up to the climax. and most importantly<br />6. The ending.<br />That being said, if you were a fan of the movie and want to read a little bit more of Tyler Durden's ramblings on life, then the book will provide you with the opportunity to do so.
B000001Y5J|5.0|As many have said, this EP is incredibly intense and powerful. The utter hatred is, impossibly, beuatiful in a way. Although some may find the material objectionable due to its total, honest emotions, it is art in the highest sense of the word. I would say &quot;Wish&quot; &quot;Last&quot; and &quot;Happiness in slavery&quot; are three of the most jarring, focused works it has ever been my pleasure to hear. Trent Reznor changed his style drastically in this album- it proceeded Pretty Hate Machine and one can see the differences immediatly. This work is not as techno inspired. It is bolder, more on a raw, emotional level. Still, Reznor manages to weave his amazing talent for production and flawless musicality into the mix. An incredible, awesome work of pure power by one of the best performers ever- this is music on steroids.
B000002JSV|5.0|The one and only Eddie Van Halen has proclaimed Bon Scott as his all-time favorite singer, and 'Down Payment Blues' as one of his favorite rock songs ever. Van Halen is someone who knows a thing or two about hard rock music, so I would trust his assessment of POWERAGE. Order it today.
B00004SVID|5.0|This release only brings back painful memories of the fateful day I heard that Roger had left the band.  The set is of amazing quality and is so unique with Roger and Dave sharing vocals on many songs.  What a combination these two made.  Rick Wright and Nick Mason are simply puppets and are not needed in the least.  I hate to say this but the only reason that Wright and Mason are in the band is because Dave could never have been allowed to use the Floyd name without them.  They are both great musicians and Rick is a great singer but the truth is that Roger and Dave are resposible for 95% of Floyds music.  Get this set and enjoy.  God blessed these boys and it is time they opened their eyes and realized that.  NIGHT
0312954468|4.0|A wonderful book. It started a little slow and at first I didn't care for the protagonist, but that quickly changed. This quickly became a delightful richly embroidered tale that made me deeply regret that I eventually ran out of pages. It has become one of my favourite novels.
B000002C1W|1.0|Simply lacking in the area of uniqueness without a doubt.  Dave does turn in a nice performance with the guitar as usual but the songs sound like the band Simply Red or something.  Gimme a break.  Give yourself a break and pick up Amused To Death or Division Bell and leave this one to the diehards.
0312954468|5.0|The sequel to River God is even better than the original. The novel keeps a steady riveting rhythm and rich character with out the slower start of River God. I recommend reading the two books in conjunction to really appreciate the ancient Egyptian Protagonist. This is a rousing novel that begs to be made into a film.
B0000027I6|5.0|Roger really did an amazing job with this disc and he should be proud.  Being a christian man I do not agree with all of Roger's sarcasm regarding the Lord but I don't take it too seriously and I would hope none of you would.  That aside, this is one of the best the master ever put out.  My favorite tracks are What God Wants pt 1 and Three Wishes.  I also really enjoy The Bravery Of Being Out OF Range and Watching Tv.  This disc is different than the other Floyd stuff and even different than Rogers other solo work but it still has the great Floyd sound and Rogers unique vocals.  He is the most unique vocalist to ever strap on the mike and this disc shows a different side to his vocal talents.  You won't hear anything like this on a Pink Floyd disc these days because they can't sing the way Roger can.  I rate this disc right up there with the glory era of Floyd. '71-'83---&gt;&gt;seriously
0767830520|5.0|Taxi driver is the best movie I have ever seen. I first saw it five years ago and its impact has never lessened for me.<br />The portrait of disturbed and lonely man, Taxi Driver is more than just a movie- it is an experience. Each scene in the movie contains (or is seen from the point of view of) cabbie Travis Bickle and by the halfway point his persona begins absorb you. You can feel his pain, his isolation and his desperate need to connect with somebody or something. In the hands of a lesser director or actor (De Niro's performance is beyond superlatives), this movie would have been a cold, lurid explotation of a sick mind but, instead, it is a searingly powerful meditation on violence that transcends its audience's desire to judge these characters. By the end of the movie you can feel the inevitablity of Travis's explosion and some of the scenes depicting his growing alienation are truly heart-wrenching.<br />This movie is disturbing, shocking and violent. It is definetely not for all tastes but it is undeniably one of the powerful movies ever made.
B000021XS0|5.0|Ok folks. I've been hearing a lot of people saying they don't understand the ending.  And I've also read countless times that SFAM is a story about Nicholas being the reincarnation of Victoria.  NOT SO.  Nicholas is one of the brothers reincarnated.  The therapist is the other brother reincarnated.  As far as which brother is which, that part i don't know for sure.  My guess is that Nicholas is the one who killed his brother in the past.  As Nicholas tells his story through hypnotherapy, the therapist realizes that the story is familiar to him.  And in the end, after the session, Nicholas goes home to find the therapist waiting for him and the therapist kills him (hence the &quot;open your eyes nicholas&quot; and then the scream).  My guess is the therapist was killed by Nicholas in the past, and gets his revenge in the present.  This plot line seems to make the most sense.  If anyone disagrees, please let me know via email. But I'm pretty sure that I'm close to the mark on this.

0871137380|4.0|Hmm. Never been in the military huh. I am an ex-Ranger that read what you had to say and thought you needed a little advice. You talk as though you think the Rangers and the Delta force just make up their own missions and carry them out at their own discretion. These men may be the best but that means nothing when their commander in chief and polititians posing as Generals are making   the faulty decisions behind the use of these elite troops. Do you really think these units would have repeated these tactical missions over and over if it was up to them? Wake up you fool! The term proud is used when these men are thrust into this situation and how they handled the horror  that insued once those decisions were made by polititians who really had no place to make them in the first place. Why the hell do you think military service is a factor in Presidential elections? A correct statement from you might have been...America has nothing to be proud of when it comes to politics in Somolia. Rangers and Delta teams are not political creatures. Unfortunatley they are often chess pieces in a  game of  poker. Remember that.
B0000062Y2|5.0|I have BOTH of the JCS CD's and this one is my favorite. Part of the reason for that is that I was lucky enough to see the stage version both with and without Ted Neeley. There was no comparison. While I thought that perhaps after so many renditions, he might be stale, I quickly saw such was not the case. While Ian Gillan may have a slightly more melodious voice, the emotion and power of Neeley's full performance adds so much more soul to both the title character and play. This comes through the sound track, as it  came through both the movie and the stage production.<br />This has become a Holy Week staple at my home.
B00004ZD69|5.0|. . . this is post-nothing . . . this is now . . . but it seems like it's been here forever . . .
B000002J1H|5.0|As a thirteen-year-old in 1977, I bought this album on vinyl (it was one of my first record purchases).  I'd only heard one track (the amazing PARALLELS, still my favorite single Yes track ever) on FM radio, but I'd read a Rolling Stone review in which it was given five stars out of five (I wonder if RS would own up to that these days).  I listened to the record, and began a trip onto the Yes universe...a journey that still continues today.<br />Now, owning all of their work and considering myself a serious fan, I still consider GOING FOR THE ONE their finest achievement.  It's not typical of their output (both musically and in terms of the non-Roger Dean cover) but there's a certain quality to the recording that doesn't sound like anything else.  I've spent years trying to pin it down:  Is it the church organ, the resonance of the Swiss recording venues, the otherworldly harp sounds, Squire's indescribable bass sound, Howe's &quot;country&quot; guitar, or all of the above. Perhaps it is the indefatigable sense of optimism that pervades this recording...even in its melancholy passages.  This is music that celebrates the human spirit, being alive, and everything that's good about progressive rock.  An album for the ages.
B00004W5UA|5.0|I saw this movie the first day it opened for two reasons; (1) because the soundtrack was incredible and (2) I'm a huge Brad Pitt fan, especially in movies like SEVEN and TWELVE MONEYS.<br />Needless to say I was not disappointed.  Fight Club is a powerful film, on all levels, but most importantly it displays the power of the mind to overcome all obstacles.<br />The more times you view this film the more you will learn, and so I would highly recommend purchasing it.
B000000FG8|5.0|There is so much to say about this album.  It is the quintessential punk/ska album of all time.  Members of the band helped spawn dance hall crashers and rancid, and inspired others.  All 27 songs on this album are great.  When i first listened to it, the first 4 songs got me, and after that i had to buy albums like this.  Also, unity is probably the best punk song ever, begining with Tim's opeaning lyrics that song also inspiried other bands to the cause.  So buy this album, you will not be wasting your money like if you bought some blink 182 cd or sr-71 cd.  This is what punk is about
B00004XONN|5.0|&quot;Everything in its right place.&quot;  Thom Yorke almost whispers the words that open up this starkingly brilliant album.  Some fans would say this album is a departure for the five piece band from Oxford, England.  Most would say that they've seen this coming for a long time.  Just look at the contrast between all three of their previous releases.  The Bends was a magnificent leap from Pablo Honey.  OK Computer solidified Radiohead's role as rock saviors of the 90s.  Kid A blows all of them clear out of the water.  From the first notes you can tell they moved in a completely different direction from their previous releases.  The first track, &quot;Everything in its Right Place&quot;, opens with a repeating synth riff that sucks you in.  Soon after, Yorke's soothing vocals enter, sounding more like someone talking in their sleep than singing a song.  The standout cut, &quot;How to  Dissappear Completely&quot;, is a beautiful, sweeping song complete with a full string section.  &quot;I'm not here, this isn't happening&quot; Yorke proclaims.  The guys that support him; Colin(bass) and Johnny Greenwood(guitar), Ed O' Brien(guitar), and Phil Selway(drums) all play their parts perfectly.  They accentuate the odd, yet beautiful vocals of Yorke.  This is truly a masterpiece, an odd one at that, but most of them are.  This album made me love music again.

B00000K0DT|5.0|A suspenseful and brilliantly-crafted film.<br />Kevin Spacey turns in the performance of a lifetime.  The rest of the cast were wonderful as well; there was not a bad performance in the film.<br />The language is strong and there are a few graphic, violent scenes, but the film is absolutely amazing and should not be missed.  An intriguing story; you'll be talking about it for hours afterwards.
B0000508U6|5.0|This must be the most amazing album put out in recent years. i haven't been a fan of current music since the mid 90s for lack of anything meaningful or worthwile. this is something completely diffrent for those of us who are hungry for good music in the usa where teeny-bop rules the charts. the 2 biggies in the uk are 'yellow' and 'shiver', my favorite happens to be 'sparks' just something about it is breathtakingly beautiful- like holding hands and taking a walk on a wistful snowy day. coldplays songs are about love and dispair, but in a good way. this is not angry, hateful music. it is amazingly relaxing, already my bed-time headphone favorite. chris' awesome voice and his lyrics seem so personal, you won't be disappointed in buying this album. no frills, no gimmicks music... get in on them NOW!!!
B00004T9UF|5.0|I hate rap music but bought this wanting to know what all the fuss was about.The first listen made me sick to my stomach with fear, the second was intriguing but scary, and gradually I got the jokes and started to understand the pain and anger coming though in the lyrics; and his struggle to express that to people OUT THERE. I'm buying his previous album now, I want to hear more. There aren't many people with the guts to lay it out the way EMINEM does.  I advise anyone out there to try this CD if you want to expand your thinking a little. ...work out<br />The reason why he is triple platinum is because  most people either dont listen to the lyrics or they just want to jump on  the bandwagon like the rest of them.
B000000993|5.0|TOOL is just simply genius!! Their a band that makes you think, and never seces to amaze anyone! The musicians are mindblowing, and the song writting is like no other band I have ever heard before!! I have been a big TOOL fan since 1994, and I must say that despite the genius of  AEnima, I must say that this is my favorite album by TOOL, or any other band! Maynard's one of a kind voice, along with the rapid fire drum kit of Danny Carrey, and the guitar solos with actual structure courtsey of Adam Jones. The only thing that could have made this album any better would be the presence of Justin Chancoler! the bands current bassist, who joined, after Paul left the band. He's just better, and it reflects well on the bands sound! I believe they diserve so much more credit then all of these cheesey rap metal bands today. It takes more talent to make your music real like TOOL does, then to just follow some stupid trend. If you want a &quot;good times&quot; band tool is not for you. If you want a band that will make you think and give nothing but quality music for a long time, by all means, buy this album, and AEnima!
B000002J1S|5.0|&quot;The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway&quot; is Genesis' first stab at a concept album, and it's a darn good one at that. This double-album centers around a lost soul named Rael, who wanders the streets of New York City and finds himself in one crazy adventure after another. The Disc 1 highlights are: the title track, &quot;Fly On A Windshield&quot;, &quot;Broadway Melody Of 1974&quot;, &quot;In The Cage&quot;, &quot;The Grand Parade Of Lifeless Packaging&quot;, &quot;Back In N.Y.C&quot;, &quot;Counting Out Time&quot;, &quot;The Carpet Crawlers&quot; and &quot;The Chamber Of 32 Doors&quot;. &quot;Cuckoo Cocoon&quot; and &quot;Hairless Heart&quot; are fine tracks as well. Disc 2 highlights: the superbly crafted instrumental &quot;The Waiting Room&quot;, &quot;The Supernatural Anaesthetist&quot;, the melancholic &quot;The Lamia&quot; and &quot;Silent Sorrow In Empty Boats&quot;, &quot;The Colony Of Slippermen&quot;, &quot;Riding The Scree&quot; (love the line &quot;Evel Knievel, you got nothin' on me!&quot;), &quot;In The Rapids&quot; and &quot;It&quot;. Nothing against &quot;Lilywhite Lilith&quot;, &quot;Anyway&quot;, &quot;Ravine&quot; and &quot;The Light Dies Down on Broadway&quot;, as they are all well written tracks. Genesis' collective genius really shone through on this album, and is one of the best of their early period. &quot;Lamb&quot; also marks Peter Gabriel's curtain call with this remarkably talented group of musicians, who found the strength to continue onward as a unit. &quot;Lamb&quot; is a rather unique concept album, and this one-of-a-kind double CD gem should not be missed by any die-hard Genesis fan. This one's a must-have!
B0000046KM|5.0|Would that I could give Shirley Horn's combo-and-strings set 200 stars-- it's just that wonderful. Shirley plays to her usual high standards, and the orchestra just adds more gentle thrills. Johnny Mandel has carved a niche for himself as a sensitive, careful arranger for jazz singer/pianists, and this recording with Shirley Horn highlights his gifts: orchestrations that stay respectfully out of the vocalist's way (his pastel shadings mesh with Shirley's Impressionist chordings as perfectly as a Monet landscape), but maintain the same still intensity projected by the soloist. Shirley's voice projects a unique blend of wistful hope and world-weariness, but in the climax of the title song, her voice rings over the orchestra with spine-tingling power. Another highlight was the moving &quot;You're Nearer&quot;, simply Shirley singing and playing without accompaniment; this performance can be analyzed for hours vis--vis its seamless union of piano and voice and silence-- or enjoyed as arguably one of the most perfect vocal ballads of our time, rivaling Shirley's &quot;The Music that Makes Me Dance&quot; on &quot;You Won't Forget Me&quot;. A stunning CD.
B00000DFSK|4.0|U2 was a rock powerhouse throughout the 80's. This collection is great for any U2 fan. If you haven't experienced U2's music get this CD and check your pulse!
B00000J7S8|5.0|The development of Diana Krall has been a joy to watch. Her Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole tribute CD was a great introduction to her special gifts: her fun sense of swing, her great rapport with her combo and that dusky, bluesy voice, relaxed and intense at the same time. This CD shows her at peak form, mature and confident. Her cover of &quot;Let's Face the Music and Dance&quot; is lovely; compare it to Anita O'Day's equally brilliant up-tempo interpretation and you get a new appreciation for composer Irving Berlin's later, astonishingly advanced pieces in his songbook. Her work on the title track is gorgeous. And her take on &quot;Popsicle Toes&quot; makes the song an adult, erotic pleasure-- the same magic she worked on Nat Cole's &quot;Frim Fram Sauce&quot;. All in all, a great CD.<br />If you have not seen Diana live, please do. Her show at the Hollywood Bowl with Tony Bennett was enormously satisfying. She played &amp; sang beautifully, her stage presence was charming, and she dueted sweetly with Tony for a few songs. But the highlight was her intense, powerful, quiet cover of Joni Mitchell's &quot;A Case of You&quot;-- for that magical moment, time stopped and every person in the sold-out Hollywood Bowl was held in silent rapture, holding their breath, not wanting to miss a single note. A wonderful experience.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Ignored by record labels in her home country, Dido, like the excellent David Gray, had to look abroad to gain attention, and due to the taste of the producers of Roswell High it got noticed in America. Soon even Eminem was using her voice, she's being compared to everyone form Sarah McLaughlan to Jewel, and has top 40 album success. Her voice is a scintillating blend of everything from those mentioned to the lilting of Andrea Corr, and Harriet Wheeler of the underrated Sundays, and the musical inspiration fo her brother Rollo, of the eclectic dance act Faithless, shows class and style to the songs. My favourites are Here WIth Me, My Lover's Gone and Isobel, but everything has some class. It's ironic that whilst Dido couldn't get a record deal at home, despite her stunning contributions to several Faithless records, when the okay but lumpen and outdated pub-rock of the Stereophonics get so much success. In the US they have sold 40,000 albums, despite supporting Live on tour. Inded all the UK records currently in the US chart add electronic influences to classic styles- Radiohead, Dido and David Gray. A good sign for where music could head.
B000002AS1|5.0|If you enjoyed the &quot;Forrest Gump Suite&quot; on the double cd soundtrack you will love this release. This release contains the orchestral score that complements every scene from Forrest Gump. It is a  very moving and powerful soundtrack that adds so much feeling to certain scenes, especially &quot;You Can't Sit Here&quot; and the recurring &quot;Jenny&quot; themes. The only track that doesn't belong here is &quot;Jesus on the Main Line,&quot; the only original vocal track written for the movie. That should have been released on the previous compilation.  You get a good 40 minutes of peaceful music in this package, perfect to put on at work or at home for stress relief. Fully orchestrated and thoughtfully arranged for such a wonderful movie. Buy it!
0790729733|4.0|This was a film that I have seen numerous times, and every time I see it, it's like I'm watching it for the first time and feel enlightened again.  You pick up something new every time. Some of my friend's who have also seen it say that if you don't pay attention to the opening credits with President Eisenhower giving his farewell speech and Martin Sheen narrating over it, you will be lost.  Now I have an extensive video library and like many others I have made the transition to DVD (one of the best decisions of my life). So now I am in the midst of replacing all my VHS tapes to DVD, so I noticed that with my DVD copy of JFK there is no additional footage of, as in my VHS copy, &quot;The question of Conspiracy&quot;, a behind the scenes look at the film.  So I ask Warner Brothers, Oliver Stone, Arnon Milchan and anyone else involved in this wonderful film, what's the deal? A special edition DVD with no theatrical trailers, behind the scenes footage come on!  This is why I still haven't gotten rid of my VHS copy.  How about exploring the controversy behind the making of this film, how about adding these special features and interviews with the actors who did such exceptional work (props to Donald Sutherland and Kevin Bacon). Aside from that I recommend this to anyone who does not believe that truth is definetely stranger than fiction.

0345441184|5.0|Dear Readers,<br />I have read this novel 5 times. Each time kept me at the edge of my seat, each time made me feel every emotion of the characters, each time made me laugh and cry and feel angery for some of the evil characters. I felt like I was secretly there, watching every move of what was going on, like I was a fae myself. One time, a few years back, during my senior year in high school I had to do a book report and I choose &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot;, and from that I got an A on my report. Well, I know you will enjoy this novel as much as I did. Have fun reading the wonderful world of Marion Zimmer Bradly, she is a goddess in her own right of her creations. :-)
0684833395|4.0|Heller's novel did not dissapoint.  I  was not sure what to expect when I selected this book but I was thouroughly impressed.  I am not a big fan of war books but this novel is much more than that.  Heller's attention to detail and great dialogue made this book exciting to read.  The conversations held by the characters not only make you laugh but also make you think about the points that they are discussing.  Heller's use of vocabulary also inhances the quality of the book.  He uses words that are specific to the war and time period.  Although sometimes I was confused by the large vocabulary I kept reading because I knew that I would still understand what was going on. Heller describes the scene of war as a place that at some times people would hate to live while at other times a place of paradise.  I think that his description of the characters is unlike any i have ever read.  Heller describes the characters by writing about their actions and past expierneces.  He uses their actions to write about the way they treated others and they way they thought about things.  This method was very usefull because it didn't cause the book to stop and explain the character it just told the story and described the character at the same time.      Many times in society we take for granted our views on others and ourselves.  This book realates the tragedies and triumphs of war to the problems of human society.  It opens the minds of those who cannot see the wrongs in society.  I think the term &quot;catch 22&quot; which is used throughout the book in many different instances refers to life.  In the book no matter what the pilots do they cannot get out of flying the missions, while in life no matter what a person does during there life all people will endure the same tragedy of death.      This book is great for all people who love to ride rollercoasters.  Heller takes you on an exhilirating ride through the emotions of the characters and tragic happenings of war.  I would reccommend this book to anyone who loves to read books that open your mind and make you think.
0679879269|5.0|Phillip Pullman came to speak to my class, and I was intrigued when he started to talk about the golden compass trilogy. Once I started it, I couldn't put it down. I loved how it was so different-and yet the same as the other books in the series. TAS is the, hands down, best book I have ever read! It has such an elegance, I was just blown away by it! READ IT!
6304535570|1.0|This is a totally ridiculous flick. Characters and places are very sketchy and hardly credible. It misses the tongue in cheek charm of the James Bond movies. As Russian I have to admit I was annoyed about the fact that Russia was pictured so one-dimensionally. It portrayed as an awful place populated by murderers and money-grabbing morons. But the mercenary spy named Simon Templar saved the place. The Saint is driven by pure monetary reasons, but also by crusading spirit (one of the first scenes shows him as a boy reading a book about Knights Templar). Just passing by he manages to liberate the people of Russia from the grip of the monstrous, crazy and power-craving oil magnate. On the way he meets one very nice girl and falls in love. The movie is so bad that it is kind of a satire on itself. At places it reminds me the moronic anti-American propaganda of the Soviet times but in reverse. If you want to see a movie with real suspense, well-developed characters and real Russia you should get \\"The Russia House\\". \\"The Saint\\" doesn't hold a candle to it.
0425104052|2.0|All endings of his short stories are exactly the same.  I feel like I'm reading the same story over and over. After you have read one of his stories you have read them all.  It is very boring to read his books and I do not enjoy them.  All the plots are predictable, which takes the suspense out of the mystery.
0156465116|5.0|This book is an all-time classic and deserves more than five stars!<br />The story of The Little Prince can be read at many different levels of meaning.  In fact, the wider your mind and heart, the more you will appreciate the story.  But the narrower your mind and heart, the more you need this story.<br />On the surface, it is a bizarre tale of an aviator stuck in the middle of the Sahara who encounters a small blond boy who tells him far-fetched stories about travel among the planets.  At this level, you need to suspend disbelief and simply go with the story to consider the ways that becoming more child-like are valuable to the aviator.  It makes him more understanding and open.  He has wanted to maintain connection with his child-based self, and does so.  It does not matter if you want to believe that the child actually travels amongst the planets or not.<br />You can also read the aviator as having been affected by the heat and dehydration, so that he is imagining the Little Prince in his delirium.  From that perspective, we are dealing with an internal dialogue of the aviator in evaluating what is most important to him in life, as he considers the possibility of losing his.<br />At a different level, you can see the Little Prince's travels to other planets as an allegory for all of life.  What are we seeking for?  How do you know when we have found it?  How can we lose what is important?  The examples of self-absorbed adults, beginning with the aviator, provide many cautionary tales.<br />Beyond that, you can read this as science fiction.  How would an alien see humans?  How would an alien react to humans?  Would an alien want to stay or go home?<br />A religious person can see an allegory to the life of the spirit.  Christians will see a Christ-like figure in the Little Prince.  People of other religious beliefs will see instead God in each person.<br />Someone with a profoundly humane perspective will see the story as being about orienting ourselves towards caring for and loving each other and nature.<br />An existentialist will see this as a tale of the futility of much of what we do, much like The Myth of Sisyphus by Albert Camus.<br />I could add many more interpretations, but do not want to burden you.  These illustrations are here to simply help open you to the idea of reading (or rereading) the story.  Most people read this when they are too young to capture its broader meanings, and it is one of those books that changes as you age.  As a child, you identify with the Little Prince.  As an adult, the aviator becomes more important.  At some points in your life, you may identify even more with the people on the tiny planets described here.  So this is also like holding up a mirror to yourself to see how you have changed.  That is also a very valuable thing to do.<br />Many will argue that the fox's lesson is the core of the book.  While I agree that that is one logical reading, I think that how one draws a sheep that will live a long time and not eat a flower is the core lesson here.  That part of the story comes near the beginning.  Be sure to pay attention to it and think about it as you go forward.  I will say no more here about it.<br />After you have finished reading and thinking through this wonderful fable, I suggest that you determine if those you love have read it lately.  If they have not, this would be a good time to get them a new copy and encourage them to begin or renew their acquaintance with Saint-Exupery.<br />During the process of reading the story again, I happened to also find an abridged audio tape by Louis Jourdan at the library that I highly recommend.  Your understanding of the book will be greatly enhanced by this great, magical reading.  It is one of the best audio readings I have heard.  If you can listen to the tape and reread the story, that is the best combination.<br />Keep drawing from your mind!ds caring for and loving each other and nature.     <br />An existentialist will see this as a tale of the futility of much of what we do, much like The Myth of Sisyphus by Albert Camus.   <br />I could add many more interpretations, but do not want to burden you.

B00003CX6P|5.0|Taunt, smart and surprising. The brutal, sudden violence will set your teeth on edge. Excellent film, excellently made. The acting is top notch. Anyone who is critical of Damon's acting hasn't seen this film. Highly recommended.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|You know, I was thoroughly despondent over the breakup of celebrity supercouple Lisa Bonet and Lenny Kravitz (then known under his gentile name Romeo Blue).  Besides months of secluded agony, my only therapy was to listen to Lenny on the hi-fi, for hours on end.  What a tragic time for all involved.  Let's have a toast, a pass of the Manischevitz crackers, and a hearty &quot;HAVA NAGILA!&quot; to Lenny as he marks a career milestone of a GREATEST HITS compendium (available on CD, cassette, and limited-edition vinyl).<br />Customers who bought this also bought:<br />A razorblade.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fantastic. Vicious. Brutal. Advocates the destruction of our society. I loved it. A movie for my generation. Brad Pitt plays The Orange Duke to Ed Norton's static: Highly recommended, one of my favorite films of all time.
B00004XOWM|3.0|True to Marxist doctrine, a supreme being will rise up amongst the proletariat to lead us all to a better communal life.  And that time is now, as comrade Fred Durst exemplifies the best of Lenin, Chairman Mao, and Generalissimo Fidel Castro in his new, cryptically-titled release &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog-Flavored Water&quot; (a euphemism for communism).  Pay close attention to the dogma-laden track &quot;Rollin (Urban Assault Vehicle)&quot; as Chairman Durst peppers the listener with a frenzy of staccato-paced communist diatribe.  Once you go red, you never go back, baby.<br />Customers who bought this also bought:<br />A lobotomy

B000002NIW|5.0|Wow a band that caused music to evolve, Deftones are one of the most impressive metal bands ever to come out.  Melding melody and raw brutal anger Chino can sing like a chior boy or scream like a dying soul.  Not just great singing but great lyrics, everything isn't trendy about this cd, no rapping about &quot;me and my hommies are the atomic bomb, word up dog&quot; and no... singing like that pop stuff, Deftones did something only fans of the music will understand, not just like.  The singing and lyrics don't stand tall over the music either.  Not one part of this band is lacking from Chi's bass lines, to Abe's Drumming, to Stephen's guitar work.  There isn't one song that is underpar with what these guys can do.  From the single My Own Summer to the hidden song talent just flows from your stereo.
B00003CX8J|1.0|I went into this movie with an open mind, and left feeling like I wasted my $8.  This movie lack the great story and special effects of movies like: Batman and Robin, Supergirl, Battlefield Earth, Happiness and Enemy Mine.  Patrick Steward as Prof. X? AWFULL.  They should have casted Wayne Newton (he has more acting chops).  As for the rest of the cast, I thought their acting left alot to be desired.  Personally, besides Newton as Prof. X, I would have had as Wolferine, Steven Segal; Storm, Sally Field; Cyclops, Robert Downey Jr.; Jean Grey, Rupaul; and Magnito, Nipsey Russel.<br />Note to Brian Singer.  Re-watch these classics, and if it's not too late, make the sequel much better.
B000002I2G|5.0|The Soft Parade is least &quot;Doors&quot; sounding album in their catalog.  The album does have their traditional guitar, drums &amp; keyboards sound but it adds a heavy orchestration element including strings.  The album opens with the blare of horns on &quot;Tell All The People&quot; and then slides into the big hit single &quot;Touch Me&quot; which continues in the orchestration vein.  &quot;Shaman's Blues&quot; and &quot;Do It&quot; follow.  &quot;Easy Ride&quot; breezes along while &quot;Wild Child&quot; moves away from the horns and such and is a straight rocker with a pounding guitar riff.  &quot;Runnin' Blue&quot; has a country feel and features a rare Robbie Kreiger vocal.  &quot;Wishful Sinful&quot; has a gorgeous and pensive sound and the album closes with the epic title cut which contains bizarre lyrics even by Doors standards.
078610984X|4.0|Yes i know, there are too many books on MARILYN and you won't want next year's calendar, but at least do you a favour and read this book because it is very well done.You learn of the most important thing in MARILYN's life:her insecurity ,that made her attractive to husbands who wanted to protect her but couldn't really help MARILYN to live her real life outside media trappings of all sorts.A sad life indeed for a woman who was the men's ideal fifties body.BILLY WILDER probably said it best when he confessed that making the two films with her was hell.
B00003CWTI|1.0|Despite the fact that I give this film only 1 star (and then only because there is no zero option) this is a truly remarkable film.  It has some of the best acting I have ever seen, combined with excellent directing and filmmaking.  Despite these, it still manages to be an awful, miserable film. <br />In a fair and just world it would take Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best whatever Actor and Worst Film all in one go.  It came across as mundane, boring, depressing and, after 2 hours of waiting for it to make some kind of point, frustrating. <br />I watched this last night with my girlfriend and a friend, Will. Warning bells started ringing around 2 hours into the film when we realised that the thing still wasn't really going anywhere.  After 2 and 1/2 hours we were compelled to check the remaining time and were horrified to discover that there were 40 minutes of this drivel left. My girlfriend went to bed because she just couldn't take it anymore.  Will and I hung on because we considered ourselves to be real men who could take anything.  Then, at around the 3 hour mark, just when we were on the point of eating our own hair, 6 million frogs dropped out of the sky.  We were gobsmacked. Had the world gone completely stark raving mad? The point and justification of the past 3 hours of vitriol seemed to be solely that, apparently, it all really happened once. Great. Fantastic. Ninja. So what?
B00003003R|4.0|Had it not been for a few missing flannel shirts, roots in Hollywood instead of rain-soaked Seattle and an utter lack of self-righteousness, the Gunners might be remembered today as the first great grunge group.<br />Like Nirvana, Pearl Jam and the other up-coast rockers who came after them, Axl Rose, Slash and the boys mixed heavy metal, punk and crowd-pleasing power-pop hooks into an ear-blistering sonic blast.<br />Topped by Axl's frantic, bleating vocals, Guns' best album, 1987's Appetite for Destruction, became one of the bestselling debut albums of all time. But self-Destructionwas more like it, and the band ran out of ammo after only four studio albums of original material. Rose, who could compose songs of surpassing pop beauty (&quot;Sweet Child o' Mine&quot;) and unsurpassed ugliness (the misogynist &quot;Used to Love Her&quot; is included here, along with hits like &quot;Paradise City&quot;; the racist &quot;One in a Million,&quot; thankfully, is not), may have been a jerk. But he and his band could rock, as this two-hour-plus, 22-track double CD attests.
B000002KHY|5.0|His warm, earnest vocal style has always gone down easy, and his folky, introspective compositions are among the most touching and astute in pop history.  So, packed with 12 songs from Taylor's definitive and acclaimed Warner Brothers years, this is one Greatest Hits package no one should be without.<br />The somber tone of &quot;Fire and Rain&quot; didn't stop it from becoming one of Taylor's biggest hits, and the song still aches with a gorgeously-sung longing that is impossible to resist.  &quot;Something in the Way She Moves&quot; and &quot;Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight&quot; are among Taylor's best romantic ballads, and his reading of Carole King's &quot;You've Got a Friend&quot; (featuring backing vocals by Joni Mitchell) remains the definitive version of the song.  &quot;Carolina in My Mind,&quot; &quot;Sweet Baby James,&quot; and &quot;Walking Man&quot; are all beautiful acoustic ballads with a sweet hint of country, but Taylor proves adept at lightening up too, on the touching &quot;Shower the People&quot; and a joyous reading of Marvin Gaye's &quot;How Sweet It Is (to Be Loved By You),&quot; both featuring vocals by Taylor's then-wife, Carly Simon.<br />Without so much as one lackluster composition or performance in tow, this hits package plays like an old friend you're always happy to visit.  11 million people can't be wrong.
0394800184|5.0|I am looking for books for my nieces and nephews and when I saw this book it brought a smile.  I remember reading this to my kids when they were little, they just loved it.  I highly recommend this book, it will be a favorite!
B000002TWN|4.0|Just when the lines between R&amp;B and rap were at their blurriest and the closest you could get to hearing classic soul on the radio was a sample, along came a singer/songwriter who knew that where R&amp;B had been was just as important as where it was headed.  D'Angelo's debut album, &quot;Brown Sugar,&quot; with retro and jazz influences plus soul to spare, marks the arrival of a most important artist.<br />Even when D'Angelo's beats are their hip-hoppiest, a classic sensibility for melody makes the title track and &quot;Me and Those Dreamin Eyes of Mine&quot; sound just as old-school as they do new.  His falsetto self-harmonies bring Marvin Gaye and Al Green readily to mind, and if either were starting out in music today these songs would be right at home on their own projects.  The appropriately-titled &quot;Smooth&quot; lays jazz influences over its street-friendly beats, and &quot;When We Get By&quot; even goes so far as to offer straight-up swing, sounding like what might happen if Steely Dan crossed paths with Prince.  <br />Adding to curb appeal is a smooth-as-silk hip-hop take on Smokey Robinson's &quot;Cruisin,&quot; as well as the hypnotic &quot;Lady,&quot; surely one of the slickest and sexiest soul ballads of recent years.  In fact, the only truly-mediocre moment is &quot;Jonz in My Bonz,&quot; a track whose sparse melody wouldn't sound so repetitive if it didn't drag on for nearly six minutes.  But one lapse in judgment (or editing tact) is forgivable: soulful, understated, and sure-footed, &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; places D'Angelo amidst soul music's most promising artists.
6300214419|5.0|Perfect movie, real state of art ! Flawless playings of R. De Niro and M. Streep. I never thought, that trivial love story might be shown so touching. Watching this story about love you realise, that nothing can stand between those loving each other. And this movie is one more proof of sining talent of R. De Niro as an actor capable of playing any role.
0897500482|5.0|I had the opportunity to see Bruce Lee in action at an East Coast karate tournament in 1969. He wasn't competing but was there as a celebrity guest. <br />I stood with others at the back of the tournament hall and listened in awe as he talked about having just finished filming Marlow and his plans to leave soon for Hong Kong to begin filming a movie. <br />Later, I watched him warm-up a great tournament fighter named Luis Delgado. Lee's speed was absolutely incredible. His backfist was nearly imperceptible and his footwork for closing the gap was a blur. <br />What a loss to the martial arts world that he left us so soon. But we still have this book of his notes. It a wonderful bible, if you will, that will make any martial artist look at his own training to see how some of Lee's ideas can fit. <br />There will always be the Jackie Chans and Jet Lis who will come along and dazzle us with their screen antics. But Bruce Lee was a seeker of knowledge, a true master of the fighting arts and philosophy. Some of it is in this wonderful book.  <br />As an author of 13 books on the martial arts, I highly recommend this book for every MA library.
B00003CX8J|4.0|I'm not an avid comic reader, so I've never actually read &quot;X-Men&quot; before( though this movie made me want to read it).  Still, the storyline was easy to follow, and I could tell that a lot of characters had to be cut so that the few which remained had enough depth to give the movie some dimension.  Bryan Singer is an absolutely awesome director; he is at his best again with an ensemble cast ( much like his '95 thriller &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;).  My personal favorite is Wolverine and Magneto: Hugh Jackman can't be replaced, and Ian Mckellen shines also.  <br />What makes &quot;X-Men&quot; so interesting and different from regular good guy-bad guy action movies the most, though, is that there isn't that obvious distinctness which seperate them.  Magneto and his pack seem like they're all evil and the X-men all good, but they are not without its flaws.  They aren't Supermen; they are human.  But those are the traits which make them seem like true heroes-at least in my viewpoint.  <br />Don't miss the action sequences also-they're completely breath-stopping!  4.5/5
B000002J1B|5.0|Relayer is Yes music. I've been listening to Yes since '71 and The Yes Album. Relayer has been my favorite since it came out in '74. It was no surprise when &quot;The Gates of Delirium&quot; was voted the song fans most wanted to hear on Yes' recent Masterworks tour. I agree with an earlier reviewer. It's a twenty-two minute musical roller coaster ride (as all great compositions should be). It's also a deeply moving statement about the terrible human destruction caused by war. Like most of the best Yes material, Relayer is best when experienced when you can give it your full intention, i.e., headphones and no interruptions. The more you listen, the more you realize that each note is placed perfectly where it should be. This work belongs in the library of any serious music lover.
B000003TAW|5.0|About a year ago I was really into the rock scene.  I was listening to anything from punk to hard rock and anything in between.  I was listening to some cover songs from The Deftones and I stumbled upon a cover of a Weezer song entitled &quot;Say it Ain't So&quot;.  I was amazed by how it could stick in my head so!  I decided that I would hunt this.......Weezer band down and find out what my friends didn't.  I bought this CD and I was amazed..........it was non-fabricated alternative at its finest.  I later found out that Weezer was the inspiration for many punk, alternative, and hard rock bands alike.  This CD is a no brainer, and should be owned by people of all ages.  Check out this CD if you like:Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Deftones, Stone Temple Pilots, and about any other band that was in the &quot;grunge scene&quot;.  Good luck shopping/browsing!
B00004YW6I|5.0|Having been a huge PJ Harvey fan since &quot;Dry&quot;, I am amazed that she has yet again topped herself.  This is one of those CD's that comes out every few years that is so brilliant, that I can barely contain my excitement.<br />This album will be appreciated by fans of her earlier work, &quot;Dry&quot; and &quot;Rid of Me&quot;, as well of fans that took notice with &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; and &quot;Is this Desire&quot;.  &quot;Kamikaze&quot; and &quot;Big Exit&quot; may remind fans of the aggressive guitar and drums of her earlier work, while &quot;Horses in My Dreams&quot; and &quot;A Place Called Home&quot; sounds more like her more recent stuff.  While this album reminds me of the earlier work, it sounds much more laid-back, natural and flowing than the in-your-face aggression and melodrama of previous albums. <br />Polly Jean proved herself to be an amazing, unique guitar player years ago; she should now also be considered one of the best vocalists of her generation.  &quot;Good Fortune&quot; is a perfect example of that.  &quot;Good Fortune&quot;, &quot;Kamikaze&quot;, and &quot;This Is Love&quot; are highlights.   <br />I fear that this record will propell her from large clubs and small theatres to hockey arenas.  She has been the best kept secret for nearly a decade now;  looks like it is time for PJ to explode.
B00003CXDG|3.0|After seeing the movie in the theaters I thought it was much better than the first, it is but only in the action category. It was full of action, and though I find the racing bike scene a little too far fetched for Tom Cruise or any person to whip a bike around the way he did. I did find the scene where he used the bike's rear view mirror to aim his gun and fire behind him something original and unique. <br />But John Woo needs to A. stop using two guns in every movie, B. stop having the characters diving in mid air while they fire both of those guns in every movie, and C. don't use a wash out overrated actor like Tom Cruise for an action flick. Even Arnold at his old age does far better than Tom Cruise. <br />After seeing it at first at the movies I gave it five stars; after seeing it at home and after reconsidering the pros and cons it sinks to three stars.
B000005IZ8|5.0|Towering and anthemic, reflective and pondering, confused, outraged, humbled, empathetic, impressed.  This is some of the most intriguing music to come out of the modernist genre, let alone movie sountracks.  The movie is worth watching- it's as provocative as the music is evocative, but the film relies on the music much more so than the other way around.  Anyone could listen to this music, instantaly recognize it as foreign, strange, and still find something familiar and understandable in it.  This music is fairly well sampled, and I've heard it in movie trailers and on PBS.  National Public Radio's Ira Glass, host of &quot;This American Life, (who happens to be obliquely related to the composer) often uses cousin Phillip's music on his radio show, although I believe it is from the Soundtrack of Eroll Morris' masterpiece &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot; (That's a must-see film too, by the way, with a great Phillip glass score).  Definately check this CD out.
B00000I8BX|4.0|For those of you metalheads who hunger for crunchy riffs and something, well...somewhat different, this album is for you.  I'm one of those guys who appreciates heavy music AND melody at the same time.  While FF doesn't delve into the melodic as much on this album as, say, Demanufacture, it's got some great moments, most notably in the climactic track, \\"Resurrection.\\"  I personally like the melodic twist that Burton Bell will throw in the midst of his growling....TEXTURE, people, texture is what makes FF fun to listen to.  In between the tight instrumentation and sound fx, there's a lot going on in their music.<br /><br />I have to admit that I wouldn't mind hearing Dino Cazares branch out his playing a little bit into the upper register - not that he has to -horrors!- SOLO or anything.  He's got a great tone and his rhythm playing integrates well with the drum and bass, but I wouldn't mind hearing a little more variety in his playing.  Otherwise, great stuff!
0553573403|5.0|This is the best series of any kind written since Isacc Asmovs Foundation.  Like the Foundation series Song of ice and fire is written with the basic model of a historic event.  While the foundation series is based off of the fall of the roman empire, Song of ice and fire is based off of Englands war of the roses.  Both of these series take real human events and turn them into execellent fiction that is both deeper and more entertaning than what I have come to expect from a fatasy or science fiction author.<br />  What sets this book apart is how Martin uses a first person writing style to explain the characters actions, but he does it in a way that is barely noticalble.  The characters in this series are not only well thought out they each have different and often subtle motivations that change resolably in reaction to the events that soround them.  There are no real boo hoo plotlines and no miraculous changes of heart.  Every time a character does somthing suprizing, it is because the view that the character had been seen through was one sided, or just didn't know all of the facts.  This is also not the usuall fell good series.  Every major character good or bad is a target to be killed.  The bad guys win just as much as the good.  And most importantly there are no real super characters.  In most other series there is a character usully the lead, who has the abilitly to single-handly kill all of his enemys heal the sick, and make all of the women in the story tall and beutifull.  This series has none of that.  The leaders are just as mortal as slaves.  The champions lose when they face impossible odds and the characters good or bad who fight the smartest are the ones that win.
B00004YW6I|5.0|Well i might be biased because i am a die hard pj harvey fan but this really is a great album and a classic possibly one of my favourites so far.The first track on the album is a very good tune and leaves me wanting more,well worth the money for all fans of music give it atry you wont regret it for sure.
0553473328|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book as I did the others before it.  I was prepared to be entertained and to fall in love and I was not disappointed.  I felt that I had personally met the characters in the book.  Diana Gabaldon's books captured my heart from Outlander right through to Drums of Autumn.  Anyone who wants to be entertained by mystery, adventure, romance, suspense and sheery joy should read all of Diana Gabaldon's works.  The only disappointment I experienced was coming to the end of the book and wanting more and that is actually not disappointment but anticipation, a very good feeling.  Diana keep them coming.  These books are ones I will never forget and each winter I feel the desire to reacquaint myself with the characters. I will never forget the way I felt when Jamie met Brianna for the first time.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Upon first hearing this album, I was mesmerized. I had no interest in rock music or the electric guitar until &quot;Eruption&quot; bombarded my speakers and melted my mind. From then on, I was hooked.  Edward Van Halen is one of the greatest(if not the greatest) guitarists to ever live, and doesn't get the respect he deserves because of being wrongfully burdened with the responsibility of creating the &quot;hair band&quot; era. Maybe dying at a young age tragically would have gave him the attention Hendrix received.<br />His technique and fire for playing,especially on the first album, haven't been matched in more than twenty years. Not too many guitarists carry that distinction. Those who accuse him of being self-indulgent or too speedy simply aren't listening, or don't value the invention of the electric guitar in the first place. Even legends such as Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, and Eric Clapton acknowledge his ungodly contributions and taste in playing. Eddie is the quintessential guitar god. Buy every Van Halen album, starting with this one.
6300182452|5.0|I do not like westerns as rule.  But &quot;High Plains Drifter&quot; is an excellent movie.  Eerie, haunting and completely unforgettable, it's a classic western ghost story.  It is edgy and disturbing, but well worth watching.
B00000ILDE|5.0|I enjoyed the first ALIEN movie, but not on as many levels as I enjoyed the sequel.<br />Apart from the further development of Ripley's character, we got to learn more about the aliens themselves, and their insect mentalities, which was executed beautifully with the inclusion of a very convincing 'queen' alien.
014028009X|5.0|Ms. Fielding has created a wonderful world in this funny book; Bridget's dilemmas are every girls' dilemmas, and I loved Bridget Jones and her crazy singleton friends.  What a fun, silly, great, entertaining read.  <br />If you are looking for a deep, life changing book with a depressing theme, don't read Bridget Jones's Diary, because it will make you laugh too hard.
B000001F2H|4.0|When Eric Clapton plugged his Les Paul into a smallish Marshall amp in April 1966, Decca's  sound engineer initially refused to cooperate, declaring the guitarist unrecordable. Clapton's volume was sending the levels into orbit but the young gun refused to turn down, thus giving birth to a new sound. And what a sound it is. Thick, creamy and delicious, it was devoured by other guitar players, and its lasting influence, along with Clapton's magnificent execution, bumps up the rating here by a whole star.<br />Beginning appropriately enough with a few notes from Clapton's Les, 'All Your Love' kicks off the album in fine style, and gives the impression that Eric is just loosening up for 'Hideaway', an instrumental which showcases his remarkable fluidity, and for my money the pick of the tracks. Also outstanding is 'Have You Ever Loved A Woman', which Clapton later resurrected for Layla, and on which he takes over the singing duties. Pity he didn't do so more often because, along with some less-than-great songs, Mayall's voice is the real weak link in the chain. As his performance on 'What'd I Say' proves, he ain't no Ray Charles<br />'Beano' is certainly not the best blues album ever recorded, not by a long way, but its influence on other guitarists was immeasurable, as was Mayall's on so many of the fabulous British musicians who passed through the ranks of the Bluesbreakers. Full marks to him for that. <br />Recommended, but only for guitar fans. If you want Clapton playing and singing great songs, buy Layla instead. You'll get extra guitar legend thrown in, too.
B000002L99|4.0|The release of 5150 brought out a new era for Van Halen. First obviously, was the addition of lead singer Sammy Hagar, who now had the most enviable position in rock and roll at that time. There was never going to be another David Lee, and realizing this, Eddie and his namesake band continued in a slightly different, yet extremely rock-worthy direction. It was a more pop-oriented version of the supergroup that still new how to bring the fire for it's core fan base.  Interestingly, Eddie, the guitar god for the past 25 plus years, took his playing down a musical avenue that included a tighter tone, and wilder fretboard and whammy bar antics. His experimentation with a Steinberger guitar on tracks like &quot;Summer Nights&quot; continued to impress everyone and trounce the idea that his reign of the guitar community was soon ending. Hagar, besides belting out songs in his trademark scream, also brought guitar playing to the table, which freed Eddie up to play the keyboards and further explore his ideas utilizing different musical approaches. And of course there remained the most underrated, but rock-solid rythmn section of Alex Van Halen and Michael Anthony, playing the drums and bass respectively. A new chapter yes, but Van Halen has always been a band that reinvents itself time and again. Instead of following musical trends, they set them, with imitators hopelessly trying to catch up. As long as Eddie is onboard with his unsurpassed abilities and knowledge, the band will surge on in spite of hardships and obstacles. Luckily, these haven't included a bad album.
B000002AZ8|3.0|Everyone seems to love this album, many going so far as to praise it as Pearl Jam's best.  I guess I just don't get it.  Betterman and Immortality are great songs, and Not for You is certainly bearable...  but lets face it, this is an album with a track entitled &quot;Stupid Mop.&quot;  The rockers on here are too repetetive, too boring, and smell too much of mindless punk rock too possibly compare with rocking-yet-insightful tracks on earlier Pearl Jam albums such as Once, Glorified G, Leash, Even Flow, etc.  Oh, and Corduroy is a GREAT song live, but on the album it just somehow doesn't sound as good.
B000005JXG|5.0|Shame on the Pogues American label for dropping this fantastic album from their catalog!<br />This is a flawless record.  The Pogues were never more energetic, creative, witty, and on and on and on.  The title track alone is worth the price of admission.<br />I really liked the Pogues prior to If I Should Fall From Grace; this album made me love them.  &quot;The boys of the NYPD choir were singing 'Galway Bay,' and the bells were ringing out for Christmas Day...&quot;
0375707972|4.0|This emotional book is worth the read for its ability to make one think about the many issues that were layed out brilliantly: a young man and an older lover, his high social status versus her working class, his education versus her ignorance.  Add to that the guilt that the new generation of Germans who had nothing to do with the Nazis are still faced with; the guilt that is the curse of their heritage.  <br />Schlink brings all of these points togther for a fascinating and emotional book through the poignant characters of Michael and Hanna.  <br />Although the translation creates stilted reading (thus 4 stars and not 5), I recommend this book highly.
B000001FDQ|5.0|Few guitarists have managed to impress me. Yngwie Malmsteen definetly astounds in immeasurable degrees. Being addicted to Van Halen, worshipping the very man who played &quot;Eruption&quot;, I was never intrigued by any other players for a while. A guitar instructor advised me to give Malmsteen a listen. When &quot;Far Beyond the Sun&quot; set my speakers on fire, my jaw dropped in disbelief and utter ecstasy.  The entire Rising Force album is simply incredible, and such a young man with such an incredible grasp of the instrument almost gives an impression of possession, much like Pagannini, one of Malmsteen's heroes.  Many hear the blazing speed demonstrated on the fretboard and dismiss the music as self-indulgent. They are simply not listening. What makes Yngwie so fantastic is his ability to play complex, seemingly impossible melodies with heart and soul. &quot;Icarus Dream Suite&quot; is mere proof of that.  Not simply &quot;shredding,&quot; a vague term in and of itself, but playing with exquisite amounts of emotion at the same time.  The fact that he was one of the few players to create a signature sound and technique of his own in the guitar ladden years of the 80's is testament to his ability.  Truly a guitarist of legendary proportions, with the ability, attitude and grasp of musical knowledge to match. Finding another player with such skill and ferocity is a futile task. Van Halen is still the Guitar God, with Yngwie Malmsteen presiding over a different brand of six-string wizardry- neo classical rock.
6302794331|4.0|As an English Major, I abhor it when movies desecrate timeless classics of literature. (Disney's desecration of Hugo's &quot;Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; offended me to the quick.) As charming as the muppets are, I never would have thought that they could tell the story of Dickens' &quot;Christmas Carol&quot; so well! Interestingly the personalities of the different muppets actually do coincide with the the characters from Dickens' book quite well. Even Mrs Piggy's outbursts and harsh remarks are not very distant from the actual character in the book. The truth is, the movie is so well done, that you almost lose awareness of the fact that the majority of characters are puppets. The images and music are very well done. I still feel Caine is at his absolute best in his role as Detective Fred Abberline in &quot;Jack the Ripper.&quot; But, he is one of the best Scrooges I have ever seen. I honestly feel this movie accomplishes something wonderful. Not only does it tell the story very well, but the use of the muppets can actually get children interested in the timeless works of Charles Dickens.
0440224764|5.0|Having been a Grisham fan ever since a friend introduced me to 'A Time To Kill' years ago, I was eager to get into 'The Partner' but I must admit, after 'The Client' I had been wondering whether or not Grisham had been losing his 'can't miss' status. 'The Chamber' was tedius and let's face it, at times just plain boring.  'The Rainmaker' was better, but not by much.  I was just about to give up on him when I received 'Partner' for Christmas a few years ago, and felt a total charge out of this newest thriller.<br />Not a SINGLE Grisham book takes off as quickly as this one does. This one takes flight virtually from page 1 and stays aloft for the entire story.  Someone told me before I finished it that they enjoyed the book, but felt let down by the ending.  So I sort of prepared myself for a great story that had a lame ending...boy was I SURPRISED!  I LOVED the ending!  Justice is dished out in many different ways, and for me, I felt it was totally appropriate.<br />Why on earth did Patrick Lanigan fake his own death and snatch away millions of dollar's of his Firm's money?  You don't really find out the answer to that until almost the end, and if I were to have any one complaint about this book, it was that Grisham got me SO INTERESTED in the WHY all that happened that I wanted to know the answer, I NEEDED to have the answer.  The fact that he could get me to wanting to know the answer just kept me going that much more than his previous novels had.  MUCH more compelling than ANYTHING else he has done before, and a LOT different, too.  So much so that I wondered on more than one occasion if 'Partner' was even written BY Grisham...not that I do not have faith in him to write such a great story, but it really is a change from anything else (in MY opinion) he had produced up to this point.<br />As far as legal thrillers go, I believe that there are a LOT of other authors who do the genre much better than Grisham does (namely Richard North Patterson, Steve Martini &amp; Phillip Margolin) but 'The Partner' stands with the best of any of these other guys.  Simply put, the Best novel Grisham has written by FAR.mp; Phillip Margolin) but 'The Partner' stands with the best of any of these other guys.  Simply put, the Best novel Grisham has written by FAR.
0064431789|5.0|One of the great things about being a parent is sharing the best parts of your childhood with your own kids, and so I was thrilled the first time I read this classic book to my son.  Max is a little boy who gets so mad, he is sent to his room without his dinner.  The illustrations show a jungle growing around him in his silly white costume and his adventure begins as he tames the Wild Things.  Now that I am a mom, I love the ending since after he has sailed over a year and back a day and his dinner is still warm and waiting for him.<br />Buy this book for your kids, and if not for them, buy it for you and relive a part your childhood for just a moment.
0679879269|5.0|This trilogy by Phillip Pullman will be a classic for both adults and children, a claim that is made all too often but is true in this case.  If you are offput that this may be a children's book or is too much science fiction, don't be! Under the umbrella of an excellent novel with an intricate plot, well-developed and extremely complicated characters this trilogy deals with physics, organized religion, adventure, personal responsibility and more.  His Dark Materials is a  haunting and disturbing trio that stays with the reader well beyond the end of all three novels.  Only read this after the other two: The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife.  <br />People read books for different reasons: some like beautiful and lyrical writing, some well enjoy well developed plots, and some prefer novels more character driven. His Dark Materials will satisfy almost any reader.  They are the most interesting books I have read in a long time.  Pullman did an excellent job in terms of research and searching his imagination, a function not often used.  READ THESE BOOKS!
B00003CX8I|4.0|Just when I thought comic adaption was a dead genre, X-MEN by Bryan Singer of the Usual Suspects fame has scripted a movie packed full of stupendous CG graphics and more importantly an enchanting allegory to life.<br />The clash between Magneto and Professor X and the human intensity in the action-packed drama captivates, because of a tight script and a well-ensembled cast boasting credible acts from Anna Paquin as Rogue and the enigmatic Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. It dissects a human drama between the difference of a mutant and ordinary, of race and segregation, and it makes the audience feel for the idiosynacractic ways that the mutants handle their grief of being ostracized. Professor X is suitably diginified; Ian McKellen as Magneto is embittered.<br />The fluid CG graphics add a sparkle to the action scenes where you see Wolverine and Storm wielding their power against Toad and Mystique and Bryan Singer has impressively incorporate so many characters in one show and yet able to make each and every hero alive. The only thing you blame is - there isn't deep characterization for every one of them, but that's understandable. <br />It's such fun and nostalgia to see your heroes and heroines battle out,criticizing the accuracy of the portrayal. But in the end - you realize the impact of X-MEN's popularity is the grandeur of the solid human dissection between good and evil.
B00004XONN|5.0|What more can I say about KID A that hadn´t been said in the 948 previous reviews?  For me, KID A is the only step Thom &amp; Co. could take after the huge success of OK COMPUTER. But that's not the only reason why it is so brilliant. This is the record that definetely shows why Thom Yorke is the musical genious of our times.  Finally, after 7 years of searching, he found the place where he belongs... and I'm sure it is not on earth. <br />Everything is in its right place, except we.
B00003CXBK|5.0|The way you appreciate a movie depends a lot of what you expect from it when you go to the theatre. Those who think you have to leave your brain when going to the movies will find Princess Mononoke boring. Those who think animation should only be for kids will be disgusted. Those who are not able to appreciate another culture and mentality will wonder that all that fuss is about. So please watch Princess Mononoke open-minded and open-hearted. Then it's easy to realize that Mr. Miyazaki's work is rich, intelligent, meaningful with deep characters and story. This film is one of my all-time favorite (animated or not). I mean, it was so absorbing... Without any sentimentality, it almost made me cry.
B000000WCV|5.0|Dogs, Androids, Firemen, &amp; Tomatoes. Thats what Daft stands for or so they say. This is some of the best music to listen to the waves, horizontal, vertical, sprirals, tunnels, &amp; ripples in the music. You hear it a lot better when you are frying, (just a tip). Check it out when ya fry, (call a radiostation and ask if they will play Daft Punk's Around The World). I say 100% of this album is good. Any questions e-mail me at yuckplace@hotmail.com .
B000002JPA|5.0|This CD is a wonderful mix of talented musicians, good singing, deep lyrics, and is certainly a nice change of pace.  Alot of other people who reviewed this commented that they play fast just to show off, but even if that is true, would you expect them to play slow and not showcase their talent?  In addition, they all play perfectly in sync with one another in a multitude of time signatures, which makes for a fantastic sound as compared to the boring '4/4' most bands play.  Admittedly, the lyrics take a while to absorb, but once understood, help to take the listener through the music with emotion.  My personal favorites on this CD are &quot;Surrounded&quot;, &quot;Metropolis Pt1&quot;, and &quot;Learning to Live&quot;.  James LaBrie has a very appropriate voice for this kind of CD, and hits high notes with ease.  John Petrucci does play fast, and some would say he is a showoff, but keep in mind that he is capable of playing way faster than he shows.  If you don't believe me, listen to 'Acid Rain' on Liquid Tension Experiment 2.  John Myung plays perfect bass, and can shred as well, just listen to the instrumental of Metropolis and find out.  Kevin Moore's keyboards are flawless, and he has a penchant for writing fantastic lyrics, especially those in 'Surrounded'.  Mike Portnoy's drums take an avid listener to appreciate, especially during 'Metropolis', where although they seem out of place at first, turn out to be one of the defining factors of that song.  Combined, it makes for an incredible album which changes emotion and feeling from song to song.  However, this is probably not for everyone.  I recommend it to those who actually play music and those who can appreciate fast yet melodic playing.  Also, a good mind is necessary to truly understand and feel the lyrics, so I don't recommend it to lazy listeners.  Overall, five stars without a doubt and a sure recommendation.
B000002HRE|5.0|I`ve never heard reload. According to me Ride the Lightning is the best Metallica release. The only reason why I`m writing right now is to respond to eliminator428 who dared to say that Exodus` guitarists, Gary Holt and Rick Hunolt were talentless. Oh boy, you really don`t know what the hell you are talking about. These two guitarist are amongst the best pairs of twin axe attack that exists along with Adrian Smith and Dave Murray of Iron Maiden, and K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton of Judas Priest. Keep in mind here that I`m not thrashing Metallica`s guitarists which are great (Kirk Hammet used to be with Exodus), I`m thrashing Eliminator`s factless comments. And for those of you who would like good ol` thrash metal, metallica-like (old), try out Exodus` BONDED BY BLOOD and FABULOUS DISASTER. Rock on!
B000002J09|5.0|<br /> <br />      Can a CD get wrecked by listening to it so many times?   <br />       Led Zeppelin IV, or Zoso, is one of the best albums out there.  I would say it's one of my favorite albums around now. If you are looking to buy your first Led Zeppelin album, go and buy this one first.  If you have never heard a Led Zeppelin song before, then you are in for a big treat.  My personal favorites are, of course, &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, and &quot;Misty Mountain Hop.&quot;  The guitair work by Page is perfect on this album, and the way Plant delivers the lyrics are just perfect.  If you are looking for more of a blues type album, go and buy their first self-titled.  But, if you just want an all around great album, do yourself a favor and buy this one.  Almost every song on this is a gem.  BUY IT! It's well worth the money!
0783226543|5.0|One of my top ten favorite films.  Certainly not without its flaws, but most are minor (except that accent problem... Pacino has the acting talent to have refined it).  I love movies that examine characters trying to escape difficult situations (&quot;Menace 2 Society&quot; being another example).  Just about everything else has already been said by other reviewers, but I wanted to add how moving the final scene is in the movie when the &quot;Paradise&quot; poster comes alive and deepens to purple (signifying something I won't spoil for those who haven't yet seen the movie).  I was lucky enough to see the film on the big screen, and started weeping just at that point.  Also, &quot;Carlito's Way&quot; is one of those movies that are really a collection of incredible scenes that collaborate with each other and finally come together to form the &quot;big picture.&quot;  Again, I love this kind of movie, because that's the only type of film that can be watched again and again without ever getting boring.  9/10, or 5/5 stars.
6303471730|1.0|If you can find it, get the MPI VHS version of this film. That is the official version from the Wayne estate. It is not wide screen but it has been restored magnificently. Video products from &quot;Goodtimes&quot; have never been known for &quot;good&quot; quality. This film is one of John Wayne's best. Go on a quest. Seek out the MPI version. Good Luck!

6304913176|3.0|It seemed like a satire to me. Casper Van Dien looks like a G.I. Joe action figure come to life. That alone helps the satire. Paul Verhoeven is making some kind of comment here. I am not sure about what. However it does look like a satire on the military mind and a brain-washed society. Who would want to be a citizen of such a violent society? As one of the students says in class, &quot;My mother says that violence only breeds more violence.&quot; This is not for children and I would not let anyone under 18 see this film.
0688145078|5.0|I bought this book for my 6 year old son just before the birth of his brother. We loved it! It is short for kids who need an introduction but might not want to dwell on the subject, very positive about all the family relationships - especially about being a sibling, friendly and engaging. The reason I really like the Big Brother/Big Sister difference is that the sibling-to-be spends a couple of months hearing that he or she will be a brother or sister and this book follows right along! I did enjoy the breastfeeding illustration, unobstrusive and just as easily a cuddling illustration, which is something many books skip right over. If there was anything disappointing about the book it's the fact that our Big Brother had no interest in looking at it once the baby was here. But, hey, why should I be upset with a book for answering all my son's questions so soon and so easily? ... it was well worth what he got out of it for 3 weeks' worth of reading. I recommend this book highly!
B000002NJM|4.0|We all know that soundtracks are often questionnable from a quality point of view, once separated from the film they support. Well, this is a marvellous exception !<br />Classic artists such as Bill withers, Brothers Johnson, the Delfonics or Randy Crawford really are great listening to again. Knowing that all those artists were at their peak in the sixties/seventies, this is indeed a great opportunity to discover them for those who weren't around at that time or just listened to other things then. Consider that most of the artists featured here either aren't in the showbusiness anymore (Brothers Johnson, Minnie Ripperton) or have lost a lot of gas (Randy Crawford). I, for instance, got to listen and like a lot Bloodstone's &quot;Natural high&quot; and Minnie Ripperton's &quot;Inside my love&quot; (I only knew from her the lyrical &quot;Loving you&quot;) which made me eventually buy her &quot;best of&quot;...<br />The album also contains humour (&quot;Beaumont's lament&quot;, a short dialog between Samuel Jackson and De niro, &quot;Melanie, Simone and Sheronda&quot;, and &quot;Just ask Melanie&quot;), a cheesy &quot;The lion and the cucumber&quot; (but, there again, it is part of the joke) and a song from Foxy Brown. Finally, the closing track (sounds like The Shadows...) is very characteristic of any Tarantino film.<br />Overall, this is a non-pretentious and nice compilation of sounds of the late sixties/seventies that you will not regret having if you liked the film and/or the music that was in fashion 30 years ago.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|I hate to admit it but my teenage daughter and her boyfriend turned me on to ATDI. We went to see them at the TLA in Philly a few weeks ago. Talk about an adrenaline rush! These guys were fantastic live -- high energy and high quality performance. Loved those huge afros too. I listened to Relationship of Command non-stop for about 2 weeks afterward. It's like Hot Water Music meets Foo Fighters. Still in your face but melodic too. I was pleasantly surprised by the complexity of the music and degree of musicianship. Somebody said that the lyrics don't make any sense but the best poetry is sometimes hard to decipher. ATDI challenges your mind and your emotions. Buy this disc.
B000002UAX|5.0|so many grest songs  no need for a review just buy it
B000001EGA|3.0|Slow down guys! Just because the name of this album is Captain Fantastic doesn't mean it is so great. I would give it 3 and 1/2 stars. On this album there isn't good songs like Philadelphia Freedom or Pinball Wizard which are also from 1975. Title song is boring,Tell Me When The Whistle Blows and Writing are also not very good songs. The best songs are SSMLT,Tower Of Babel,Better Off Dead and We All Fall In Love Sometimes and other songs are ok. I am a big Elton's fan and I was listening this album thousand times and I think that GYBR and Dont Shoot Me are much more better than this. But don't get me wrong,this is more than good album!
B00004XOWM|5.0|This CD is by far the best Limp has ever produced. If they continue on their current musical path, even greater sucess is sure to come. They have a perfect match of rock, rap, and even a few slower-paced songs for the easy listener. The song, &quot;Hold On&quot; sung by Fred and Scott Weiland of STP is an incredible masterpiece. &quot;Rollin (Air Raid)&quot; is the seller of this album and no question why. It's a fast-paced, uptemo rock song. NICE JOB LIMP. It's hard to impress a die-hard Metallica fan like me, but Limp has done it and I hope they continue in their sucess. BUY THIS ONE!
B000001EG6|5.0|I would give to this album 4 and 3/4 stars. This is great album,only his young voice doesn't fit to some songs. This album is special because it is more Elton John-ish than any of his other albums. This is really pure Elton and you can feel that in songs like YOUR SONG,THE KING MUST DIE,TAKE ME TO THE PILOT,THE GREATEST DISCOVERY and BORDER SONG. This is ELTON JOHN and no one can make songs like this.
0449002632|2.0|I wonder if people rate this book so well because it is so big and they suspect that &quot;big&quot; and the effort required to create it means &quot;good&quot;. Two stars then, for effort.  London fails to provide any intrigue and thus, any interest. London has been likened to a collectioni of smaller novels, taken apart like this, these sub-novels are lightweight and fail to answer the Hows, Whos and Whys of the story. Sadly, there is no synergy. I agree with former reviewers observing that women are overlooked but then so are many males.  It is a pity that Mitchener has died!

044100590X|2.0|Come on! This book is over rated. It is an amusing story but unengaging. The characters are cold and it is difficult to empathise with them. I did read the next two books to see how the story was resolved...but it wasn't, it turned into the X-files! i.e. continuous suspense, convolutions, but no resolution. A story must have a beginning, middle, and, and, um, an end? The recent appearance of the Dune 'brand extension' books &quot;House Atreides&quot; and &quot; 'Harkonen&quot; confirm that the story continues, be it chronologically before or after the original Dune. Should have been a trilogy at most.

1559272619|4.0|This is a wonderfully written story which was greatly enhanced by Jean Marsh's reading it. I was convinced that Maxim was mourning the loss of his first wife.  What I shocker when the truth came out.  The twists and turns of the plots in this book kept me jumping to all kinds of conclusions.  I would have given this book 5 stars if it concluded with what happened to Maxim and his second wife; come to think of it, I don't think her first name was ever mentioned.  Anyway, the book left me wanting more and if you read it, so will you.
0385474547|5.0|I'm not surprised by the response of our friend from Texas who seems to have only noticed the undesireable fractions of Igbo culture (murder of twin newborns as a religious practice, for example) illustrated by Mr. Achebe in this brutally honest work of literature.   Surely white Christian values and pratices are much more civilized and good-natured than those nasty Igbo---oh, wait, weren't these zealots the same people responsible for so much genocide and colonial enslavement waged against Native Americans, Africans, the people of India, China, Australia, the Middle East, and most of Eastern Europe?  Looks like Mr. Achebe's work has no heroes.  Perhaps his message is that nothing ever lasts and no one is ever righteous.
0811826848|5.0|This book is a great addition to the library of any Beetles fan.  It completely covers the Beetles, their history and each member.  Lots of photos round it out.  It you like the Beetles or just remember when they were still around, you'll like this book.  It's a great coffee table book also.  In short, it is the Beetles and everything you wanted to know about them.
0312853238|5.0|Possibly the most heart-wrenching story I have ever read.  Also one of the most profoundly insightful and beautiful.  I agree that to pigeonhole this masterpiece into the oft-misunderstood genre of science-fiction is to commit a monsterous literary injustice.  This is a story of such remarkable beauty that I have carried its message with me ever since my first reading. <br />To put it lightly, I cried when I finished this book.  At age thirteen, I was left feeling betrayed by my own species.  It is perhaps the only story ever to leave me feeling, quite literally, sick to my stomach.  In the annals of my literary experience, no other single piece of literature has impacted my soul in a more important way.  This story should be read and studied in schools the world over.<br />This one will be remembered for a very long time.
6300185311|5.0|Doris and Rock are finally married in this third film together.George(Rock) thinks he's dying,and everyone believes him untill the end.Tony Randall is so funny when he's writting George's Eulogy,and keeps changing it while Rock is yealing at him.Out of the three films,this one's not the greatest,but I still enjoyed &quot;Send me no flowers.&quot; Also,Burt Bacharach wrote the theme song.It was one of his first,and Doris loved singing the record.
B00004XONN|5.0|What can I say about Radiohead that fans don't already know, except that this British underground pop/alternative band outdoes itself every time a CD comes out. &quot;Kid A&quot; continues this string of great albums. Every song on here is great in its own way. &quot;Everything In It's Right Place&quot; is an interesting song, in the fact that it uses the first line of the song, sung by the Great White Ghost Thom Yorke, as a sample throughout the track. &quot;How To Disappear Completely&quot; is a ghost of a track, whispering along with the lead singer. However, before I go into my favorite songs, I need to make aware that no song on this CD should be skipped. This CD was meant to be listened to as a whole. I think that the brightest songs on this CD are the title track and &quot;Optimistic&quot;. Kid A, the track, is an embodiment of pure sound and pure music, likewise. It is as if Yorke and the rest captured a beam of white light and coded it into the CD. &quot;Optimistic&quot;, meanwhile, is a powerful song, in the tradition of &quot;Karma Police&quot; and &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;. It cannot be described in any language. This is a great CD that everyone should at least give a spin, whether they buy the CD or borrow it from a friend, and enjoy the beautiful noise of &quot;Kid A&quot;.
0399146253|4.0|We get to see a new side to Scarpetta in TLP.  We get to see the HUMAN side of her.  What person, even fictional (Scarpetta), can go on, day after day, without changing, once a loved one (Benton) has died?  Scarpetta is changing.. for the better?  For the worse?  Who's to say because this story is not over.  I found the changes in realistic, and the emotional side/factor of the character gave her more depth than she's ever had before.<br />Cornwell's books are always complex, this book seemed moreso.. perhaps because it backtracked so much into the previous book Black Notice.  I've always told friends that Cornwells' books are  stand alones.. where you don't need to read them in order.  But if you're reading TLP, you really need to read Black Notice first, otherwise it won't make any sense to you.<br />I give this one a 4 stars, and do wait for the story to continue in the next book.
B00004Y62T|3.0|This adaptation of a Patricia Highsmith novel written in 1955 stars Matt Damon as Tom Ripley, who's poor, but entranced by the good life.  He therefore lets himself be mistaken for a friend of a rich man's son and be sponsored on a trip to Italy with the intention of convincing the son to return to America.<br />The son, Dickie Greenleaf, played by Jude Law, is living the high life in Italy and romantically involved with Gwyneth Paltrow.  When Tom Ripley enters their world, he is at first rejected and then embraced and a friendship between the two men develop.  Complications lead to murder and Tom Ripley assumes the identify of Dickie Greenleaf.<br />The director is Anthony Minghella, who directed The English Patient, and it is clear he loves lush scenes of Italy as well as the subtle physiological states of his characters.  There is more to this story than just the action of the plot. The tension revolves around whether or not Tom Ripley will be discovered and it held my interest throughout because of a well-crafted script and excellent timing.<br />Matt Damon does a good job, but not a great one, and needs props such as horn rimmed glasses and a worn corduroy jacket to compensate for the subtleties of characterization that this difficult role demands.  Gwyneth Paltrow is competent but never outstanding. However, Jude Law's role as Dickie Greenleaf is totally convincing;  while the other actors seem to be trying too hard, he comes across as the spoiled rich boy as if this was really who he is.<br />While this video might be a pleasant way to spend a few hours, it is the kind of entertainment that is soon forgotten.  That why I can only give it a lukewarm recommendation.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|What can I say????  The only way to do a Beatles greatest hits album would be to put everything they wrote on a single CD!  Impossible - so we'll have to take this!!  This is most (but not all) of the best, by the best, and will always be the best.  This is simple to describe : over an hour of classic, tuneful music that beats anything out today.  Indeed, that is the irony here: while experiencing a sense of elation when you listen to this, you will also become depressed about the current state of rock when you compare the drivel out today with this album.  It is just amazing that 30 years and more later this music is as fresh as it was when first released. ...
B00004WIBW|3.0|I am not acquainted with the Washington Irving story, but I understand this film has been changed from the original.  I can therefore only give my impressions of what I saw in this interesting adaptation directed by Tim Burton.<br />Johnny Depp makes a good Icabod Crane, the constable who is assigned to investigate the mystery of the headless horseman in the year 1799.  He's always been a little offbeat himself, and so this role suits him well.<br />Chistina Ricci, cast as Katrina Anne Van Tassel, the daughter of the local landowner, surprised me.  She has never looked more beautiful, slimmed down and dressed in the outfits of a rich young lady.  However, her own offbeat personality which she exhibited so well in past films was gone.  And she played the role as a hundred other actresses would have done it, with none of the special quality that makes her stand out with her own particular personality.<br />Miranda Richardson as Lady Van Tassel was excellent, bringing just the right amount of sexiness and horror into her performance.  She definitely outshone the younger actors.<br />This is a good story and the script done well.  It swept me along in the mystery and there were enough twists and turns of the plot to keep me interested.  I loved all the chases and spooky sounds and startling details. The scenery was just right and cinematography excellent, often shot in shadow with filtered lenses.<br />Yes.  It was violent and somewhat scary.  But as it was a legend and not supposed to be real, it was expected and absorbed into the story.  I found it entertaining although its not for everyone and certainly not one I would rush out to try to see.  But if you're in the right mood for this kind of a yarn, you might just enjoy it.
B00004XONN|1.0|If you are under the impression that &quot;kid a&quot; is in any way a new sound or something groundbreaking, you have been fooled. Although it is really admirable that Radiohead have the ability to reinvent themselves in most of their records that does not make them new or good. All of the music played sampled and done in this record, has been done a long time ago by such visionaries as Aphex Twin, Red Snapper, GYBE, Looper and others. If you are a music fan, interested in good quality non-classical music buy those artists. If you are in the mood for reworked pop go ahead purhcase Kid A.
B00004XMTC|1.0|There are two problems with &quot;Never Say Never Again.&quot;  The first is that it is a bad movie.  The acting (including Connery) is sub-par, and the action leaves something to be desired.  However, the main problem is that this is a cheap knock-off James Bond movie.  A remake of &quot;Thunderball,&quot; the fourth film installment, &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; is not released through United Artists, and was not produced by Albert Broccoli or his company, EON Productions.  A true Bond fan knows this, and any interested party will notice the absence of 007 trademarks such as the gun-barrel opening and the truly artistic title sequence.  In fact, &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; was released as competition for &quot;Octopussy,&quot; the 13th 007 flick, in 1983.  So, plain and simple, if you want a good version of the story, buy the orgional &quot;Thunderball.&quot;
0782008372|4.0|I enyoyed owning this DVD from the time I purchased it to the time i placed it into my player.  I was happy with the over all picture quality although it was a little &quot;grainy&quot;.  The sound however was a different story.  I found the Dolby 5.1 to be over done in the areas of imaging and volume.  I kept getting this tunnel affect especially during moments of extreme sound saturation.  I can recall at least two moments when the sound overloaded producing a loud distortion crackle that made me run to the rescue of my loudspeakers.  I turned the volume down significantly and re-wound to review the scene, and the overload was still present.  I find myself watching this great movie carefully and with caution as to where these overloads are present. This greatly degrades the enjoyment of Highlander. Again, the movie is awesome but the sound bites!!
0780631684|4.0|THE PLOT: Devon Sawa is Alex Browning. He and his senior class are boarding a plain to France for a fieldtrip. As soon as they're on board, Alex has a vision: The plane explodes soon after takeoff and all aboard die. He, five of his friends and teacher Mrs. Lewton are dragged off the plane by security because Browning's panic attack. As they argue why they had to leave the plane, they are suddenly silenced by a distant explosion as the plane explodes for real. Alex Browning has saved their lives and cheated Death. Now, Death is after them for paybaxk. They chaeted him and he is not happy about it. He tries to get them all but can Alex cheat Death again? Can he save his friends? <br />THE CAST: Co-starring Ali Larter as Clear who shares Browning's visions, Kerr Smith as Carter, a guy who blames Alex for the death of his friends and Tony Todd as the coroner who knows a little to much about the rules of Death.... The acting is actually average but... what do you expect from newcomers and Teen TV Stars? The appearence of Tony Todd is a joy for everyone who knows him and Ali Larter stands out as the best actress in this film.<br />THE FILM: The film stands out as one of the most original horror movies of the 90's. There is no flesh and blood killer which makes the story more interesting. The death scenes are suspensful, gory and not without a sense of irony. The shock effects are rare but well planned and unexpected. The story has its flaws but the atmospheric cinematography lets you forget. You'll be on the edge of your seat from start to finish. However, the film loses its impact with repeated viewing. Also the characters are pretty flat but the story is too short for developement anyway. The reactions to this movie in the theater was awesom. So if you wnt to have a good time, invite some friends and put in this DVD.<br />THE DVD: The DVD features include two documentaries, actor and director commentaries and isolated score with commentary by composer Shirley Walker. One of the documentaries is about how testscreenings can change a movie and that smaller companies, like New Line, have to rely on them in order to make profit. It is quite interesting to see what questions the testaudience has to answer and makes you kind of sad, that a bunch of people can change an entire movie. But it is a business and that is very well shown in this feature. The other documentary is about a female officer who fights crime with her psychic abilyties. She forsees events and can save lives through that ability like Alex in the movie. This feature also is pretty interesting, if you wanna believe in it os another question cause we know since blairwitch, that it is easy to fake something like that these days. The actor's commentary is fun to listen to cause they are pretty funny. Director's commentary is average but insightful. The 5.1 isolated music score is pretty good. Being a fan of film music I love that feature cause the score is not available to purchase. It is a mediocre score but &quot;The march of Dead&quot; is a beautiful theme which is basicly heard in different variations throughout the score. <br />The DVD is definetly worth buying.
B00004Y7SF|2.0|She should have been in the movie &quot; Scream&quot; since she love to scream so much in every songs. i mean , if you really want to scream, at least do it like Mariah carey. this album is good but too much of Christina showing off. Mariah Carey's christmas album is WAY much better
B00004W3MS|5.0|Jaw dropping beautiful music.  A warmer Labradford, a softer GYBE!  The prettiest music I have heard since Aphex Twin's SAW 2.
B00003CWL6|4.0|Ricky, the boy next door, is the hero of this film.  He and possibly the gay couple are the only ones with their heads on straight. Lester gets there eventually. As for the film being soft on drug use, all I have to say is, lighten up! Man has always had the desire, one could even say the need, to experience altered states. Let's face it, sometimes drugs, especially entheogens, allow us to appreciate the beauty that's always around us, just ignored. There ain't nothing wrong with that!  Lester, right before he is shot, comes around to the same conclusions as Ricky did and in his after-death voice-over he reiterates Ricky's monologue about beauty. Lester finally got it. So, the film actually ended on an up-note for me. What really tipped me off about the &quot;trippy&quot; feel to the philosophy of the movie is Lester's &quot;gratitude&quot; for his life.  Three things I will always remember from my shroom trips as a young man are all mentioned in this film: the beauty in everything, the benevolence of it all (God? I think so), and the thanks one wants to express for being allowed to experience this world. To me, these ideas are the core of the movie.
B00003CXDG|5.0|This is a very entertaining movie. A John Woo film which has many slow motion shots that are very effective in the stunt sequences and dramatic shots that work well with this film. Tom Cruise did just about all his stunts bringing an amazing quality to the entire film. This movie is a thousand times better then James Bond:The World is Not Enough. The Ethan Hunt character is much like a modern James Bond for America.
6305807086|3.0|Being John Malkovich is... an interesting film.  I'll give it that.  The premise is very intriguing.  Once I heard about the movie, I had to see what they did with it.  And I wish they had done more.<br />The 3 stars I gave this movie are all for originality and the potential to inspire some really great movies.  I really like the premise and a couple of the scenes are hilarious... but the psychological overtones are a little too much.  They distract from the overall originality, and besically lower the enjoyability of the film.<br />I'm all about this level of originality and making new rules for the &quot;movie world&quot; to live by, but I have no desire to watch dementia.<br />This is worth a viewing if you're really into seeing something completely different, and I doubt we'll see many films like this around, but just don't expect the be all and end all of movies in this one.
B000002W8O|5.0|This album is one I initially purchased in 1957.  An ardent Elvis fan, I played the album constantly.  I converted my father to fanhood, though he was a classical music fan who loved opera. He thought Elvis had a beautiful, rich voice that took him way beyond the lable &quot;rock 'n roll&quot;.  The songs on this album, from the low-down blues sounds of &quot;Santa Claus is Back in Town&quot; to the reverent &quot;Peace In the Valley&quot; are beautifully excuted by Elvis and wonderfully produced.  The whole album brings back a great era for me personally and everyone I know who hears it. It's a Christmas classic for me, but one that I tend to play all year round.

078401213X|4.0|Pi is such a bizarre movie that by the time you've finished watching it, you feel like you've just seen a toss-up of wacky images that don't relate to each other.  But it is also very gripping and interesting.  There's really no way to describe the plot in a few sentences.  But I can say that it's about a genius schizophrenic scientist who loves numerical patterns, and he searches for the numerical pattern that created the universe, which develops into an earth-shattering sequence of 216 numbers.  The music is eerie and excellent for the complex scenario.  The black-and-white cinematography is simply not to be believed!  But the ending and plot is so bizarre, it's hard to find anyone whom I know will not find any flaws in Pi.  Or maybe they will.  I'm just 14 years old, so I don't know everything.<br />Rated R, for bizarre and disturbing images, and for language.  The atmosphere is also very intense.  Too intense for preteens if you ask me.
B00004XONN|4.0|It's worth the buy if you're a radiohead fan, but it's not up to par with ok computer and the bends.
B00000IQBM|5.0|This is one hell of a movie.<BR> Saw it on TV a few years back, and I thought it was great.<BR> Everyone says it's a really scary movie, but I would have to say I only found a few scenes scary.<BR> This is a must-see-movie. If you haven't seen it, BUY IT NOW.
B00004U8PA|1.0|This film came out 25yrs ago and flopped,and looking at it,it isn't hard to see why. This made the  recent &quot;South Park&quot; movie look good. Why anyone likes it is beyond me,my wife does and she asked me to watch it with her and I tried... I really did,but after about 10 minutes I was shouting at the screen and I don't think it was what I was supposed to be shouting either so she asked me to leave which I did, gladly. I have this annoying thing I do called &quot;Thinking&quot; and the more I thought about this movie the more I hated it. The plot (if it has one,I couldn't find it) is a joke, the acting stupid,and it has a good cast too Curry,Sarandon,Meat Loaf. Honestly,whoever made this owes his cast an apology.As I watched this I couldn't help but think we are deep in &quot;Student Film&quot;country here. If you like a &quot;good movie&quot; as this piece of garbage is so often mistakenly called,rent &quot;Star Wars&quot;either one of them,they are the definition of &quot;Good Movies.&quot; definitely avoid this though and mabe it will finally go away.
B00003CXDG|1.0|This has to be one of John Woo's poorest offerings to date, and his trademark scenes are becoming ever more repetetive in successive films. Perhaps the abundance of hype surrounding the cinematic release of this movie, really didn't do it any favours, as it never lived up to expectations. The sad fact is that a talented ensemble cast and great SFX, have been nullified by a storyline that could have been written on the back of a stamp. Even the super quality of DVD, the sexy Nyah, torrid chase and action scenes can't save this movie from a lame script. Not half as good as the first movie, which in itself was something of a disappointment.

B000002KKS|5.0|After Ozzy was kicked out of the band, I would imagine that many thought this was the end of Black Sabbath (and I'm sure some still do), but with this album, we see that the legend lives on.  This is quite possibly the best album Sabbath ever made.  Now, I love the classic stuff with Ozzy, it reigned supreme in the '70's, but Ronnie James Dio brought a vitality to the band not before seen.  Ozzy has a great voice, but Dio sings with more passion and feeling, in fact I'd say he is one of the greatest vocalists on the planet (but at most second to Iced Earth's Matt Barlow).  It all starts off with a fast-paced song called &quot;Neon Knights&quot;, a song very much resembling Iron Maiden, very cool, which is followed by an incredible song called &quot;Children of the Sea&quot;, the second best song on the album (and by the way, it is better than &quot;Children of the Grave&quot;), and after that, &quot;Lady Evil&quot;, a good song, but you forget all about it upon arriving at the next song, the title track.  Wow, what a song!  A seven minute epic, all about the ups and downs of life, it instantly became my favorite Sabbath song (no offense to &quot;War Pigs&quot;).  Unfortunately, the second half of the album doesn't have much to offer.  They're good songs, but they didn't blow me away like the first four.  For that reason, this album might not be able to compete with &quot;Paranoid&quot; and &quot;Master of Reality&quot;, which have little or no filler.  But, there is some really good stuff on this album, and it should not be passed up just because Ozzy's not on it.  Ozzy's &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; is better though, mainly because of Randy Rhoads, but Dio's voice is awesome.  If you like Sabbath, you must buy this album.  It's a shame most people think of this as just their &quot;new stuff with that other guy&quot;, it's so much more than that.  Buy it, you won't be sorry.
0782008372|1.0|Wide Screen Review's review of this DVD?<br />&quot;The non-anamorphic DVD picture exhibits sharp and detailed images, with excellent color fidelity. Matted at 1.85:1, the picture exhibits vibrant color fidelity with natural fleshtones and deep, solid blacks. The imagery is visually exciting and beautifully atmospheric. Noise is virtually non-existent, but scattered artifacts are visible throughout.&quot;  This is no classic, but I bought it for the low price and Wide Screen's review. Boy, did I get a lemon -- granted, I'm viewing it on a Mitsubishi 70&quot; screen, but with all the adjustments I can make with the remotes from the player and the TV, I can just barely get a watchable picture.
0553573403|5.0|George R.R. Martin has a true talent for language, dialogue, and characterization.  There are no &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; guys in this story, and no one character takes center stage.  Instead you will hear the varied voices of many characters and if you are like me, you will find yourself rooting for them all, even though that seems to be an impossible contradiction since they can't all &quot;win&quot; in the end.<br />Martin is a master of surprise plot twists and character developments.  Just when when I thought I had someone all figured out, something completely unexpected would occur, suddenly throwing things in an entirely different light.  He must have taken some cues from field of mystery, because he disguises his character's loyalties and motivations extremely well.  When someone turns around to put a knife in another's back, you will never see it coming.  I gave up trying to predict what would happen next; the ending had me completely stunned and in a daze for hours afterwards.  This is Martin's strength and also his greatest sourse of frustration: he is ruthless and unmerciful when it comes to dishing out trouble in which to to embroil his characters.  He paints them all with such love and feeling, yet can tear them down with equal zeal.<br />Martin's style is dense and complex.  This is a book to be savored and studied with the care of an archeologist unearthing precious fossils, and definitely not a casual read.  It is still fast-paced and filled with action, and Martin can make even a simple conversation sizzle with intrigue and subtle manipulation.<br />Martin is an expert at description and mood as well; I can still hear the eerie howls of a direwolf on the hunt whenever I think of a particular battle scene, even months later.  He has one odd habit though which I found both amusing and slightly distracting, and that is that he often stops the action to describe in great detail the clothing a character is wearing as soon as he or she enters the scene.  In a world where one's allegiance to family and &quot;house&quot; is of upmost importance, sometimes this can be significent, but all too often it seems more like a medieval fashion show.<br />Book 2 is sitting on my desk, beckoning.  I look forward to re-entering Martin's world with both anticipation and tripidation.  Be prepared to have your heart alternately filled and then torn out, and be ready for the unexpected.  This is not an ordinary book.the scene.

6304119046|1.0|I know all the reasons that this is regarded a great film.  And yet, I find it almost unwatchable.<br />Sure, if I point to individual elements of the film (the structure, camera work, script, symbolism, theme, etc.) then I'm impressed.  But no matter how many times I watch the film, I remain emotionally unaffected.  I don't care about the characters, I don't care what happens, I just don't care.<br />I honestly envy the reviewers who find it emotionally compelling.  But I've given it several chances, and it gives me less humanity than Kane gave the people in his life.  A case can be made that Welles employed the imitative fallacy, and the emotional distance I experience mimics Kane's emotional inabilities.  Well and good, but I still don't enjoy watching a movie that doesn't engage me.
B000020617|5.0|David Grohl has written some of the best lyrics that rock music has seen since Kurt Cobain died. His songwriting has underestimated since Foo Fighters started. This album seprates him form Kurt Cobain;'s shadow. Foo Fighters have a life of their own, and with this album they have a place in rock history. They are no longer poping out a few singles from the leftovers of grunge, they are changing the direction of rock music without falling into the rap/rock trend.
6304383177|2.0|I personally love classic movies because it seems that in the days before special effects and naked bodies, movies actually made use of structure, dialogue, and character development.  So I rented this after several recommendations from my film-loving peers.<br />Now I'm going to contradict myself here.  If you haven't seen this movie, then I suggest you do.  It is so well regarded that you should see what all the fuss is about.<br />For me, however, it was such a disappointment that I turned it off before I got half way through.  Each situation seemed like more of the same, which I suppose is great when you're enjoying it.  But I found the humor forced and stale.  Thus, the over-done performances (standard for screwball) grated on my nerves.  See the movie, hopefully enjoy it, but be advised that it's not for everyone.
B00003CXDB|5.0|If you're trying to decide whether to buy it or not, trust me run, don't walk to your nearest video store and buy it now. This film is outstanding. Brilliant performances by Michael Douglas, Martin Sheen, Terrance Stamp, Darryl Hannah and by far Charlie Sheen's crowl jewel to date. Sorry, I don't count Hot Shots or Hot Shots Part Deux...please. Michael Douglas's character, Gordon Geckko, is a composite of the inside trader scoundrels that plagued Wall Street in the late eighties. Charlie Sheen plays Bud Fox, an aspiring young  stock trader on Wall Street trying to hit the big leagues during the yuppie craze of the eighties. Charlie's real-life father, Martin Sheen plays his dad in the film, and it adds an important sense of realism to the film. Terrance Stamp, a British actor, whose best known for being General Zod in Superman 2 with Christopher Reeve, sad since he's such a brilliant actor. In this film, he plays a rival British trader, who has an extreme dislike for Gordon. Darryl Hannah gives her best performance other than Splash, as Charlie's interior decorator girlfriend, whose lust for fame and money rivals his own. A great supporting cast surround the strongest of lead character's, though, Michael Douglas, who won an academy award for his portrayal, and rightfully so. Of all his film's,  this one truly exemplifies his brilliance as an actor. I leave you with a classic line to one of his many brilliant speeches in the film, &quot;Greed is Good, Greed works...&quot;
B00004Y2QT|2.0|I have to say that I am disappointed :(  I was very exited to hear that &quot;Prince&quot; was doing some of his old material for this project. However the songs just did not sound the same, the whole show was very weird.  Prince clowned around too much and did not concentrate in sounding good. Honestly, I would return the DVD it if I could.  I think that a great opportunity was wasted. The stage was too small, the crowd was dead, the musicians were dressed retro style (boring), the camera angles were really bad.  If I have to mention something positive, I will say that the sound is incredible!
B00003CXDG|4.0|After seeing Face Off, John Woo immediately became one of my favorite action directors, if not my favorite.  So I set out and watched Hard Boiled and The Killer, which made me fall in love even more with his visceral style.  When I heard that Cruise and Woo were making M:I 2, I nearly fell out of my chair!  I began imagining what I thought was going to be the most awesome spy movie ever!  But, as I sat in the theater watching this flick, I realized....something is missing.  Depth and great characters were not present in this flick.  The action scenes, of course they were some of the best I've ever witnessed, but when you don't care about the characters, what good are action sequences.  I really think Robert Towne really let us down on this script, I thought the conflict was OK, but no depth or characterization.  N-E-Way, the most awesome motorcycle scenes and a great score made me love this movie!  The 5.1 Dolby Digital track on this disc has to have THE most active surrounds I've ever heard on ANY DVD!  That alone is worth the price of this disc.  And of course to see Cruise do all of his own stunts!  Woo would be a perfect director to bring Pierce Brosnan's James Bond out of his slump!
B000002LK1|5.0|There simply are no bad songs on the disc.  This was the pinnacle of DM's career.  Gore's lyrics and Gahan's regal vocals match perfectly in this eclectic mix of songs.  Buy this CD.  If you have to have a DM CD, this is the one!
B000002VCW|2.0|Some people wrote that this was a great album because it deals with the realm of historical rock.  I'm not sure what that means, but who is Lord Grenville?<br />Lord Grenville was a 16th century \\"hero\\". He put down the Catholic aristocracy in Ireland, leading to the slaughter of Catholic peasants. He turned Buckland Abbey into his personal mansion, just so it wouldn't be used as a parish church. While in America, he burnt down an Indian village because he thought one of the Indians stole a silver cup. He was a snobbish aristocrat. He refused to serve under Sir Francis Drake, because Drake had a lower social status and Grenville was jealous of Drake's accomplishments. Grenville felt that Drake was always stealing greatness from him, being just a step ahead of him. That cost him his life. <br />Instead of serving under Drake, Grenville took Drake's old ship the Revenge and served with Sir Howard, attacking Spanish treasure ships. When Sir Howard learned that the Spanish Armada, with 53 ships, was coming, he decided to retreat. Grenville got separated from his fleet and sailed right into the Spanish Armada by accident. Instead of going around it, he tried to crash through it. He did fight on for 15 hours, but he didn't do any significant damage to the Spanish. Near the end of the fighting, Grenville was mortally wounded. Knowing he was going to die, Grenville wanted to destroy his ship, taking his men down with him. The ship surrendered instead, and Grenville died in Spanish custody. The Revenge was not destroyed, but taken by the Spanish.<br />Tennyson writes a very moving poem about the Grenville and the Revenge. But, Tennyson's account is highly romanticized and completely fictional. Grenville becomes a hero instead of the boorish oaf he was. Reviewers justify Al Stewart's song about Grenville by equating him with Tennyson. Well, I know Tennyson. Tennyson's writings are my friend and Al Stewart is no Lord Tennyson. Stewart doesn't add anything to the Grenville saga,and his story is emotionless. Stewart's song is about nothing, other than to say we won't see Grenville again. But to make it worse, the song is backed by bland, boring orchestration, bad guitar playing and Stewart's voice at it's grating worse. And it all drones on for five minutes. <br />Al Stewart can do better than this song. It is too bad you have to sit through it to get to the better material.
B00003A9QI|5.0|Rachel Portman's done it again!  This soundtrack will always be in my &quot;top ten&quot; favorites-- right along with Moll Flanders, Dangerous Beauty, and The Truman Show.  Don't listen to what some people say about it being &quot;repetitive&quot;, it's so good, you won't mind listening to the variations on themes. (I don't, anyway.)  I  already liked Ms. Portman's other work from the very first time I saw &quot;Sirens&quot;; but now I really love it!  ~looking forward to more of her music

0393317552|4.0|Packed full of interesting information.<br />3,000 years of human society around the world. It would be foolish to spend much looking at the points where his thesis   may fail instead of spending more time marveling at the mighty achievement he did accomplish. Of course, taking such a  large chunk of history and creating a theory to explain all of its shifts will not always be a perfect but it is wonderful to see  just how much of history can be explained by his wonderfully all-encompassing ideas. <br />With the soul of a scientist, Jared   Diamond has created a wonderful synthesis to explain the development of writing, agriculture, conquest, disease and many,   many other factors. Historians may balk at the largeness of such ideas, not seen Karl Marx found a convenient explanation  for all human history, but it is a wonderful book to read, whether it is delighting or frustrating. <br />It gives the reader much to  think about and hopefully allows a new perspective to blossom among all of one's older, inherited ideas. A marvelous book.

B000002MZ9|1.0|This is pretty much a waste of time. And money.  I'm a self-proclaimed: 'Neil Young (and Crazy Horse)' fanatic. Anyone who knows me would agree.  But this CD is worthless. Take your hard earned cash and buy a DIFFERENT Neil Young CD. Suggestions?  1) &quot;Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere&quot;  2) &quot;Tonight's The Night&quot;  3) &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot;  ANY of these three would be a MUCH better choice.  How and Why NY went off on this particular tangent is a mystery to me.
B00004XONN|4.0|Kid A is a little disappointing, to say it bluntly. But it is still very good, and one of the most interesting albums to come out in a while. The only problem is occassional lack of harmony- a few songs on Kid A simply don't have it (and there are only 10 songs on the album). Sometimes there is just no agreement of feeling or sound in the music. A few times Radiohead fail to capture coherency out of chaos, which is what they did greatly in OK Computer. I know this album isn't meant to have a focus on that, but there still needs to be some harmony in order to prevent songs from becoming nothing more than noise. Verse, chorus, structure-- all of these things are thrown out. You'll rarely find them here. At the very least, Kid A deserves praise for being so ambitious and unpredictable. It's full of experimental, impressionistic sound as fragmented as the abstract drawings found in the booklet. On the title track, the vocals are so warped they seem to be made out of liquid. &quot;Idioteque&quot; has a strange, futurisic, quasi-techno beat. And &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; features muted orchestra and opera singing under Thom Yorke's voice. <br />It becomes obvious Kid A throws out all musical conventions- chorus, verse, etc.- and that is interesting per se; but at the same time I can't help but think, while listening, that there's a good reason we have those conventions in the first place. Kid A is no OK Computer. It doesn't convince us that music can be made like this; but it makes its case, and it's a good one at that.
B00004T9VY|5.0|Don't need to go on about this one except to say it is a CLASSIC recording from the early 70's and I feel anyone who picks up a guitar or plays the piano would not hesitate to agree. Everything about this from the vocals to the writing to the music all flowed together to perfection. Having this remastered and given to another generation to savor only makes it more special.
B000001DWG|5.0|This posthumous retrospective of the Seattle glam - not what's commonly referred to as &quot;glam&quot; by those with vague memories of early-'90s Dial MTV, but the real thing: Bowie, Queen, T. Rex - is at once a great record and a fascinating historical document. After lead singer Andrew Wood, who was probably the driving-towards-Mercury force in the band (his prior group, Malfunkshun, was also very glam-influenced; the majority of the band came from the proto-grunge Green River, which also spawned MLB's sonic polar opposite, Mudhoney) died, two of the band's members went on to form Pearl Jam, and we all know how that worked out. A sense of &quot;What if?&quot; still hangs over this record every time I listen to it, almost ten years after it was recorded. But here's why: Tracks like &quot;Capricorn Sister&quot; and &quot;Mr. Danny Boy&quot; are nasty-sounding, larger-than-life rock songs where Wood strips himself his past and fashions himself a nouveau  over Jeff Ament, Bruce Fairweather, and Stone Gossard's frantic riffing. The ballads are devastating and tragic - larger-than-lifeness is the predominant theme throughout the band's body of work. One minor complaint: This CD, hastily released after the Wood tribute project Temple of the Dog had a hit with &quot;Hunger Strike,&quot; doesn't have any tracks (aside from &quot;Lady Godiva Blues&quot;) that weren't available on &quot;Shine&quot; or &quot;Apple,&quot; the two albums released by Mercury. (Both those albums went out of print shortly after Wood's death.) I recently downloaded a performance of Queen's &quot;I'm In Love With My Car&quot; that's absolutely blistering. It's followed by a &quot;thank you everybody&quot; where Wood's confusion over the day of the week sums up perfectly what made Mother Love Bone not just great, but transcendescent; the playful, almost shy humanity behind the outrageous posturing that made every swagger, every plea for love that much more filled with vitality and life.
0811826848|4.0|For those like me who have read this stuff a thousand times, the book wasn't a revelation. The photos were very good, and there were even some that I hadn't seen.<br />The narritatives by the Beatles themselves were a bit dissapointing and didn't probe nearly enough into the personalities of each Beatle.<br />For example, we never did hear what Harrison thought about McCartney as a person, a musician, a songwriter, etc. What did Paul think about Ringo as a drummer, Harrison or Lennon as guitarists, etc? What kind of music would they have made had they stayed together?<br />I would have preferred some really insightful comments, but the photography made it worth four stars.
0679879269|5.0|Okay, I know I'm not the most intellectual person in the world. I'm a 13 year old girl, so I obviously don't know as much about literuature as a lot of people out there. But when I first read &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;, I was hooked on Phillip Pullman's books! He is an AMAZING author...I should know...once I got hooked, I read all his books! Well, you can imagine that the &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot; was a long awaited book for me...I read the second book, &quot;The Subtle Knife&quot; in February and was waiting for &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot; since. <br />As soon as it came out, I bought it. I must admit, the first couple chapters weren't so amazing, but the end to it really delivers! If you're worried that you won't be able to sit through five hundred some pages, think again! Once &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot; catches your attention, you won'te be able to put it down! It's seriously a thrill after thrill. There's one bad part about &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot; though...it's almost NECESSARY for you to read &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; and &quot;The Subtle Knife&quot; before you read this. Otherwise you won't get the whole BANG of it! <br />To conclude, if you love Lyra, Will, Iorek Byrenson, and Serefina Pekkala, you will love &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot;...it really delivers. It's a wonderful fantasy suspense book for young and old. (And if you don't know what I'm talking about, go get the first two books of the triliogy. They're worth it!)
B00003CXE6|5.0|I saw this film the day it opened and knew as soon as the credits rolled that I must and had to see it again.(which I did, 4 times in all)  The costums, the music, the computer graphics in recreating ancient Rome were spectacular.  The acting in it also was sensational. Aussie, Russel Crowe proved himself to be an outstanding actor, and Ridley Scott an amazing epic movie director.  For anyone who has not seen this movie. YOU MUST. It should not be missed.
B00004Y2FT|5.0|A long overdue retrospective of the Cocteau Twins' distinctive and quite lovely back catalogue. Many of their most gorgeous moments have been cherry picked from most of their 4AD albums and EPs. This does mean that their last two albums on the Fontana label are overlooked, which would no doubt please their considerable cult following who spurned both of these albums -probably because Liz Fraser was actually singing words rather than her usual mad-as-a-hatter gibberish. This is very much their loss as they are both worthy additions to any Cocteaus collection. <br />Regardless of this, there is more than enough highlights in their career to choose from that any gripes to be had concern omissions rather than what is included ('Blue Bell Knoll' and 'Frou-Frou Foxes in Midsummer Fires' are two glorious moments that are absent). However, those captivated enough by this compilation will almost certainly seek out the parent albums which makes this an excellent taster for a quietly remarkable band.
0780631684|5.0|This Movie was great! If  you like suspense you'll love this movie. There is not one part of the movie where there theres no terror,and its full of screams. IF you like scary movies and suspense you have to get this!!!
6304712936|5.0|I just wanted to add my comments agreeing with the other reviewers that this is a fine movie:a winner of 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture!  The life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart makes for an interesting motion picture and his music is here for everyone to enjoy even if you are not a Classical music fan...you will be a Mozart fan after you see this DVD.
0345403959|5.0|After reading the Belgariad and the Mallorean series, this book takes you back to the beginning of it all.  It explains the origins of the young man who becomes Belgarath, and skirts the edges of the Brotherhood of Sorcerers.  It also nicely fills in the gaps from the beginning to the battle of Vo Mimbre.  A great book for the Fantasy reader, and I highly recommend the series.
0679879269|5.0|This was the perfect, long-awaited conclusion to the fantastic series- I literally couldn't put it down. Pullman's skill is impeccable and I have read few series equal to His Dark Materials. Granted, I sobbed my way through the ending, but I could expect no less from such an author. I sincerely hope Pullman will continue the adventures of Lyra and Will, if only so that I can satisfy my imagination with what happens to them after this book ends. Pullman took on a large idea scheme when he started this trilogy, but he tackled it and conquered it, and the result is the best fantasy trilogy since the Lord of the Rings. Thank you Mr. Pullman!
0452281881|5.0|Buy this book. The funniest, right on characterization of our business. I laughed so hard I cried. A must have.
B00004YW6I|2.0|Warning to anyone who hasn't heard PJ Harvey before:  don't start with this album.  You won't continue on to her others, and that would be a shame!  This album lacks all of her originality, ferociousness, and passion - it has heart, but it's of the Sarah McLaughlin-type heart - a wee placid and boring.  Anyone could have made this album and written these songs. It has its moments (the duet w/ Thom Yorke, and &quot;We Float&quot;), but it doesnt have enough of these moments.  Buy &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; instead, and see what she is really capable of.
B000008DA5|5.0|Smiley Smile received a lot of negative reviews in the rock media when it came out because members of rock heirarchy were expecting a different album-- SMiLE.  Supposed to be Brian Wilson's masterwork, the album that would change the stakes of popular music, SMiLE remained unreleased due to numerous problems that were encountered during its production.  It's available today through numerous bootleg formats-- along with session outtakes, other unreleased period songs and a vast amount of studio chatter and recorded &quot;skits&quot;.  On the internet, there are hordes of sites dedicated to discussing the album's sequencing and possible track line-ups. But while SMiLE has garnered the lion's share of attention away from its more organic, less-pretentious counterpart, Smiley Smile has quietly established itself as a period classic and one of the top albums in its genre.<br />Smiley is partially comprised of re-arranged SMiLE material, sung and played entirely by the Beach Boys as a group (as opposed to SMiLE, on which the instrumental tracks were recorded using a cast of studio musicians.)  The songs &quot;Wonderful&quot;, &quot;Wind Chimes&quot; and &quot;Vegetables&quot; appear in radically different, mood-altered versions than their SMiLE counterparts.  However, its the newer material that really wins the listener over: the gorgeous &quot;Little Pad&quot;, the inventive studio trickery of &quot;She's Goin' Bald&quot;, the sparse and effective &quot;Woody Woodpecker Symphony&quot;.  Add to this the transcendant single &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; and the fact that Smiley Smile was also the first Beach Boys lp to contain the #1 &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, and you've got an album that sounds a little bit better every time you spin it.-- no small feat.<br />I think Wild Honey is a step behind Smiley, as well as the album that followed it the year after, Friends.  That being said, the Beach Boys take on blue-eyed soul is suprisingly fresh sounding, and Brian Wilson comes up with some first-rate material, notably the funky title track, &quot;Aren't You Glad&quot;, &quot;Country Air&quot; and the gorgeous &quot;Let the Wind Blow&quot;.  A good time for all.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This movie is an instant legend.  Spacey is the perfect representation of an average American male/father/husband.  I thought my family was the epitome of dysfunctional.  This one makes the cake.  Only a nimrod would pass this one up.
B00003CX95|5.0|The only words I can find for this film are great words. I knew nothing of William Wallace before seeing the ad for this on TV. I know there are probably some if not many historical inaccuracies but to me that did not take away from my enjoyment of this film or its effect upon me.  Everything about this film captivated me and kept my attention all the way through. Wonderdul location photography of Scotland and Ireland mixed brilliantly with terrific music by James Horner. The performances by all the actors and actresses were absolutely first rate...even in the \\"minor roles\\" ie: Longshanks' son. Edward II. I long to see Catherine McCormack (Murron) in more films. She was excellent in her part too. Hats off again to all the performers both in front of the camera and behind it. (Great job both ways, Mr. Gibson!) The best thing about Braveheart though is this: It is a WONDERFUL, interesting, captivating story of love and unbeatable courage and passion. If only we all were that determined to stand up for what we believe in.<br />For the record: Yes, I did cry during the scene of the funerals of Young William's father, Murron, and during the execution of William. I am a man not ashamed to admit that this film was moving to me. Very much so. If you love grand movies with heart...don't miss this one.

B00004Z511|5.0|This album is completely unlike anything I have ever heard before.  I don't want to say much about it aside the fact that I recommend that you listen to it yourself.  This is the best way I can summate this album: after listening to it, I could not listen any other album in the same way.  that is pretty amazing to me.
630280082X|5.0|If you like blues or feeling the blues then get this movie. I like the 'selling of the soul' not for 'rock n roll' but in this case, 'blues'.<br />'blues ain't nothing but a good man feeling bad' I love the portrayal of the devil. A real smooth operator.<br />The guitar playing by Stevie Vai and Ry Cooder are the best I have ever heard ANYWHERE. As good as Jimi Hendrix? I think so. I have always preferred the Delta Blues over Juilliard music, anyways.....

0394800184|2.0|I know this is a beloved classic for many, but please be aware that it can be quite scary and unpleasant for some children. As a small child, I hated this book -- the idea of being lost and separated from my mother like that was extremely frightening for me, and the ending, where the baby bird is menaced by the construction shovel, actually gave me nightmares. I may have been unusually sensitive, but just a word to the wise parent -- make sure this book isn't too scary for your child before you choose it as a bedtime reading option.
B000002UB3|5.0|Very rarely in the history of music does a work so complete and fullfilling as &quot;Abbey Road&quot; emerge. While many people say that &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; is the most influencial of the Beatles' albums, &quot;Abbey Road&quot; to be the most complete and most fun. The album begins with the imortal Lennon classic &quot;Come Together.&quot; We then hear Harrison's best contribution to the Beatles, &quot;Something,&quot; one of the best ballads of the time of the album. We then hear probably the only weakness on the album, Paul's &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer,&quot; an overdone silly little tune. However, &quot;Oh!Darling&quot; make up for it quickly, demonstrating the sounds of the 50's. &quot;Octopus's Garden&quot; is a nice little tune about getting away from the rat race, to a world where nothing matters. Starr's vocals are excellent. Next, comes &quot;I Want You&quot; a classic mainly-instumental composition by Lennon. Side 2 begins with Harrison's second contribution, the optimistic &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; one of my absolutely favorite Beatles tunes. Next is a strange tune called &quot;Because,&quot; which features the best harmonies of the Beatles career. The mini-suite of Side Two now begins with &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money.&quot; It is continued with the &quot;Sun King,&quot; &quot;Mean Mr. Mustard,&quot; and &quot;Polythene Pam,&quot; three tunes that go together very well. Next, we have the classic &quot;She Came in Through the Bathroom Window,&quot; a McCartney classic, probably the best on the album. The suite finishes up with the lullaby &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot; and the anthem &quot;Carry That Weight.&quot; We hear a few of the notes from &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money,&quot; once again, before being taken into the classic &quot;The End,&quot; with Starr's drum solo, and solos by McCartney, Harrison, and Lennon. What a way to end the greatest album of the 1960s, and the career of the greatest band of the 1960s! &quot;Abbey Road&quot; is a very personal album and has an amazing spirit of unity among the memnbers, especially since they were going through some rough times. It is a very mature work of art that shows great acccomplishment and skill. Nothing short of a classic!
0440234743|5.0|I began reading this book because a friend of mine left it behind. What began as a leisurely read, ended as one of the best books I've ever read. The book begins with a huge shocker and only gets better from there. Definitely worth every penny and every second spent on it. It's a fast read and very enjoyable. Now I have to buy my friend a new copy because I want to keep this one!
B00004TWZF|5.0|I love explosions, I love action, I love sci-fi. You will not find these things in this film, but it touched me like no other. I can associate with this film because I grew up in an island in Greece...I can see through this film the tranquility of the Greek islands and, combined with the beautiful music, it reminded of my younger years. The sun burning the mediterranian shores, the clear blue sea, the quietness of the sea. All of these things are true and I am glad that the film attempted to contrast the difference between the &quot;modern way of living&quot; and the things that seem to matter - tranquility, beautiful surroundings and values.
B000002OFG|4.0|Tom Petty has always always been classified as a fun rocker. While his later material would suggest otherwise, after listening to this album over 50 times its easy to see why Petty gets classified that way. Running just over 30 minutes, this debut album has it all. The ten tracks are all so catchy that it is irresistible, but they have enough depth that you feel this lightweight album has personal impact. Every song is great, simple, and straight to the point. At first listen you think that you could write them, but after each subsequent play you begin to see otherwise. The only weak song is &quot;Fooled Again (I Don't Like It)&quot; because the content doesn't flow with what the other nine tracks are about. But the classics &quot;American Girl&quot; and &quot;Breakdown&quot; are featured here, along with great tunes like &quot;The Wild One, Forever&quot;, &quot;Anything That's Rock 'n Roll&quot;, and my personal favorite - &quot;Mystery Man&quot;. Not the first Tom Petty album to buy, but definitely one to own.
B0000520QY|4.0|Besides the magnificent cinematography (wich makes me dream of being there, in Mexico), the inovative direction of Mr. Brando and the inteligent plot, one thing amazed me most: the Western reached the Pacific! It's very rare to see a story of the Old West which includes sea footage. When it happens, it's time to check it out. This single detail is only one of the many surprises included in this complex and sophisticated movie, an all-time Brando's classic, the only one directed by himself.
0688171664|5.0|If you like to read more profound work that is going to make you think, go ahead and read this book.  I first bought it when I bought my motorcycle and had no clue what the book was about. All I knew was that it was a famous book.  As a theology/religion/philosophy junkie I was pleasantly surprised to read this great work.  If you have any doubts about the book, just think about it: it was written 25 years ago and it is still a best seller! That should tell you something.  Read it, no, more than that, savor it!
0882847953|5.0|Syncopation is much more than a nicely graduated reading text. Used skillfully, and with a good teacher, this classic can go a long way towards teaching the elements of limb independance and co-ordination. Superimposing ostinato patterns over the &quot;as written&quot; notation reveals a world of possibilities. <br />Bass players, as well as others, can derive benefit from the complexities of reading the syncopated figures in this book. Each exercise places  quarter notes in each measure so that the student can always see the relationship of the downbeat to the exercise.<br />Drummers, get this book, get Stone's Stick Control, get a good teacher, and you will be well on the way to the ranks of the musically monstrous.
B000000W5L|5.0|Despite the fact that Bill Wyman (the band's irreplaceable bassist) appears on but 4 tracks, this is truly the zenith of The World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band's career.  From Keith Richards' amyl-nitrate open-tuned guitar chords and Mick's mush-wit vocals on &quot;Rocks Off,&quot; to the apocalyptic &quot;Soul Survivor,&quot; let's face it folks, Rock and Roll doesn't get ANY better.  There's something here for everyone: The gospel-funk of Billy Preston's keyboards on &quot;Shine A Light,&quot; the (Oh, MAN, I wish I could've there for THIS track's session!) Gram Parsons/neo-country of &quot;Sweet Virginia,&quot; the blatantly &quot;yeah, let's MAKE a 'hit-single' outa THIS party!,&quot; &quot;Tumbling Dice,&quot; there's no better Rock and Roll anywhere.  My only concern is, when Virgin Records purchased the group's catalogue, they promised to &quot;re-release the albums with (ulp) 'cleaner mixes'.&quot;   Oh my God: do you really WANT a cleaned up &quot;Torn and Frayed&quot; or &quot;Stop Breaking Down?&quot;  You can not fix what ain't broken, folks.  It don't get any better any where.  (Sorry, all you pathetic Zepplin freaks- and, hey, Ian Stewart played piano on THAT silly group's best song, &quot;Rock And Roll!&quot;)
B00003CXDG|5.0|I think this is a great film!!  There are great action scenes in it which make this film highly enjoyable.  It is also set in the beautifull city of Sydney, which adds to the visual scenes of the movie.  It wasn't a great plot, but it is definitly worth seeing.
6305558167|5.0|For years, I only ever saw the beginning of this film.  Gabriel Bryne is practically unrecognisable as the brutish Uther, in what must be one of his best acting performances.  It's his lust for Igrayne that sets the film in motion.  To satisfy his hunger, Uther must make a deal with the mercurial Merlin, which, needless to say, he later regrets.<br />  So Arthur starts out on his hero's journey, in scenes quite similar to young Luke Skywalker's tutelage by Yoda in `The Empire Strikes Back', with Arthur both beguiled and horrified by the creatures of the forest, featuring the ubiquitous owl present in such films of this period.  After the boy king draws the sword from the stone, he is much in need of guidance.  However, Merlin is an excellent teacher who seems to draw knowledge from Arthur rather than leading him to it.  Yet it's not long before Arthur is seduced away from Merlin to other attractions, such as Guenevere.  It's around about here that I usually stopped watching the film when I was younger.  It was Boorman's battles that had first attracted me, so shiny and brutal as sword impales and thrusts armour.<br />  It's true that Arthur's Round Table is rich and lush, but rather boring.  A time of plenty, but very little drama, apart from Gawain's slander.  Arthur does not hear Merlin warn him about Guenevere, and ignores the evidence of his own eyes, as Guenevere becomes a tease and a burden to all his men and in a bizarre and highly staged dance in Leondegrance's fortress.  It's also taken time for me to like Nicholas Clay's performance as Lancelot.  Cherie Lunghi as Guenevere has never really convinced me.  The DVD edition makes her chirpy Irish accent even clearer, which is an irritation.  Their romance is treated as on the level of a high school fling, the sort of thing that is done so much better in your average episode of Buffy each week.  You squirm in your seat as Guenevere catches sight of Lancelot at the drawbridge of Camelot, with Morgana playing the role of bitchy friend.  Clay's wig at the end is also quite embarrassing:  did the make-up artist also work on Monty Python and the Holy Grail?  Having said that, most of the other characters do grow old with a bit more grace.  Of course, the main reason why their treacherous romance is so unconvincing is due to the fact that it is the only part of the film that feels rushed.  I'm pretty sure Lot was supposed to be Gawain's father in Malory, but Ciaran Hinds looks no older than Liam Neeson here!<br />  However, there are plenty of fine performances.  Nicol Williamson has never played a better role than Merlin, and there are lots of other more familiar faces, like Patrick Stewart.  It's the unknown actors who also catch the eye.  Ciaran Hinds makes the most of a small role as Lot.  Hinds is one of my favourite actors, and it's a pity he hasn't done much more film work like Neeson and Bryne.  Arthur is also Nigel Terry's biggest role to date, and I think he makes an excellent transformation from squire, to boy king, to battle hardened warrior, peaceful monarch, and cuckolded husband.  Helen Mirren plays her most seductive role as Morgana, and Charley Boorman makes a deliciously evil Mordred.  As I've watched this film again, I'm more and more impressed by Paul Geoffrey's portrayal of Perceval.  He seems to have been introduced as a counterpoint to Arthur, the young boy who dreams of being a knight, but whose cowardice makes him fear that he has lost the grail forever.  Of course, it looks as though Bedevere was just one knight too many, but you do think that Perceval would have made an excellent king if he had obeyed his gut instinct.<br />  All in all, a beautiful, luscious Pre-Raphaelite movie, with Wagner's music to produce the adrenaline high.  There is a slight suspicion that this film could be quite right wing, timed to coincide with Thatcher's lamentable rise to power.  Certainly, fascists have abused the Arthurian myth and Wagner before now, in their own bidfor world domination.  However, I believe that Boorman and Rospo Pallenberg were just attracted by such an excellent and archetypal story, and had been trying to make the film for years before the doomed British film renaissance so proudly proclaimed by Colin Welland.  This film is indeed a \\"dream to some, a nightmare to others!\\"  I'm on the side of the dreams, the charm of making and the breath of the dragon.  Ireland, my ancestral homeland, has never been filmed so darkly and sublimely.  Excalibur is a film I reach for again and again, and its haunting images will never leave me.for world domination.

6304169558|4.0|&quot;Twister&quot; succeeds on its face because it doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is, a great special effects movie.  The plot is uninspired, the acting is pretty good but not exceptional, but the special effects make the film.  The tornado sequences will literally and figuratively blow you away.  Some of the scenes defy credibility (our heroes manage to outrun a monster tornado on foot, yeah, right) but this isn't a movie that begs to be taken seriously; grab the popcorn, sit back and enjoy the ride.  And just as the real star of &quot;Cat Ballou&quot; was Lee Marvin's drunken horse, so the character who steals &quot;Twister&quot; is a cow caught up in the turbulent winds turning mad somersaults in midair, looking thoroughly bemused.  It's priceless scenes like this one that define the movie and make it so much fun to watch.
0679879269|4.0|His Dark Materials is the most incredible trilogy of books that I have ever read. When I was in 6th grade, I picked up The Golden Compass for the first time and I was completely hooked from day one. The Amber Spyglass, however, lacks some of the charm The Golden Compass for one reason: Mrs. Coulter.<br />I realize that Pullman tries to keep 'good' and 'evil' out of his books... but Mrs. Coulter was wicked in the first two books. In this book, she was 'reformed'. I was expecting to see her die a horrible death in the last few chapters. Instead, she was not even IN the last few chapters. Instead of a explosive whiz-bang climax, I was handed Will and Lyra 'saving the world with their love.' aaaa[...] ain't that sweet?<br />Although this is an amazing book, I still feel as if it's not concluded yet. Hmm... 'trilogy' can be a nebulous term...<br />But please, do yourself a favor. READ THIS BOOK. Read the WHOLE trilogy. You'll love it. After all, I've only capitalized on the negatives in this review. To list the good points of this book would take more pages than the book itself! Just don't start reading this book expecting Mrs. Coulter to die. (Like I did!)

0395735793|5.0|My children, 6 and 8, love this book.  I love Garrison Keillor on PBS.  However, the two do not mix.  The narrative by Mr. Keillor is not only lethargic but is similar to a Gregorian Chant.

0451191153|5.0|I'm only thirteen, and in the  eighth grade, so when the my reading teacher handed me this book, I wasn't exactly dying to read it. I mean, I'm a teenager! I didn't think I was supposed to read books that big. Anyway, to make her happy (and just to see if I really could finish it) I started.      In the beginning, it was just &quot;Yeah, yeah, he's an architect, no one like him, how can someone write 704 pages about this?&quot;, but after a while, I really like it.        Howard Roark is a lot like many people out there that are amazing human beings who strive to keep their ideals, and not give in to society. Peter Keating, on the other hand, is willing to do anything, as long as it pleases the boss. When he discovers that he really has no idea what is style is, and that the only reason he's gotten a good reputation is by doing what he's told, it's up to Howard to save him.       There were some parts where RAnd actually came out and directly gave her philosophical view, but that added to the plot, and actually assisted the character development of Roark, and explained a lot of Keating's mistakes. In the end, both mn are fighting for survival, and both are fighting their own demons, including each other, and they're going to half to claw their way out of the mess they've created one way or another.
B0000524CY|5.0|I hadn't seen The Exorcist before it's re-release at the theatre this year. Obviously to me it was &quot;The Version You've Never Seen&quot; but I didn't think that The Exorcist would have anything special i haven't seen before in horror films. Was I in for a shocker. Whether it comes from the movies physical aspects or mental and psychological aspects this WILL scare you. Spinning heads, spider walks, pea soup vomitting and using a crucifix... well,in a very explicit way adds up to some extremely freaky scenes. These people can act too! Linda Blair probobly still surprises the heck out of herself that this was her. WOW! You just have to see this movie! Great plot! Great acting! Great effects! What else could you want. Religious people beware! This is a definite buy for my collection! Yours should have it too!
B000002LQD|4.0|Never have been a big Lou Reed fan, he was always just so-so in my mind.  I came across Magic and Loss while on a Jimmy Scott fix (he does the background vocals for track 3).  This wasn't too bad, alot of very well done songs, much more emotional than anything i've heard from Reed before.  The album starts off strong, gets a little slow through the middle, but ends wonderfully.  The last track is my favorite.  I also have to give Mr.Reed credit for the concept of this theme album, it worked very well.
B00004YKUX|5.0|On first listening, I heard age that hadn't been in Cash's voice before and I wondered at the choice of &quot;I Won't Back Down&quot; and Solitary Man&quot; as lead-ins.  On second listening, I was hooked.  The first songs set the tone (if not the style) for perhaps the best theme albums I've ever heard.  Every trac, even the two funny ones - &quot;Nobody&quot; and &quot;Country Trash&quot;, resonates with the power of facing the world on one's own terms, and if that requires being alone, then so be it.  The voice is deep and full, and the harmonies are super.  &quot;The Mercy Seat&quot; packs an emotional wallop, but my favorite is &quot;Mary of the Wild Moor.&quot;
B00000BKDZ|5.0|This one is up there with Powerslave and Somewhere in Time which I consider to be Maiden's best works.  It is a concept album so it is a bit more progressive in some respects in terms of mixing song styles.<br />There are a couple of pop-rockers on this album like &quot;Can I Play With Madness&quot; thanks to Adrian Smith but he redeems himself nicely with his excellent guitar work on Infinite Dreams and the title track.  If I could only listen to one Maiden song for the rest of my life I would pick SOASS because of the guitar solos and twin harmony outro.<br />There are a fair amount of keyboards on this album when compared with other Maiden albums.  The guitar sound here also retains the chorus effect from the Somewhere in Time album.  This is also the last album where Bruce sings in his trademarked &quot;air raid siren&quot; style without his voice really having problems.<br />The following songs on this album are considered Maiden staples that they will/would often use live:  Infinite Dreams, Can I Play With Madness, and The Clairvoyant.
1878424114|5.0|The author helps us identify our &quot;fear based&quot; ways of thinking and substitue more effective ways to think. These concepts work. I would also recommend the book An Encounter With A Prophet to get rid of even deeper &quot;fear based&quot; beliefs.
B00000BKDX|5.0|I was introduced to Maiden around the time that this album was actually first released.  As a casette and record it came with all of the songs on this ECD.<br />Count your blessings for that because the earlier CD releases only had a single disk with ~70 minutes and a lot of the best songs missing (all of side 2).  In fact, I prefer side 2 to side 1 and although I already own TWO earlier CD versions of this same album I am buying this one anyway just to get Acacia Ave and Die With Your Boots On. For the full effect, the single from this album is also needed so you can get Murders in the Rue Morgue which is definately the best recorded version of this song I have ever heard.<br />What can be said, this thing is HARD HARD HARD, it is as hard as standard metal gets and the music is great thanks in part to Bruce and the awesome twin guitar harmonies.  I don't think I can do anything else to convince you so just lay down the cash now and start your enjoyment.
B00004WC6J|4.0|As usual, David Sylvian does it his way and his retrospective collection is aptly titled. For such a consistently fine artist, the question becomes what to leave out, and Sylvian walks the tightrope over his available favorites,( a number of which are among my favorites), and previously unavailable tracks. I really can't quibble too much with this generous offering, although I do agree with others who would love to have &quot;Damage&quot; and &quot;The First Day&quot;...both these gorgeous songs are only available to my knowledge on hard-to-find live recordings, and their exclusion on the retrospective album is a disappointment to this listener.  Since this collection is Sylvian the singer/songwriter, instrumental and ambient works are absent...fair enough, as most of that material is readily available and may be the focus of another retrospective(!) This highly personal and by no means exhaustive set will keep fans happy for the most part, and is essential for those wishing to explore David Sylvian's unique talent. I highly recommend the import version, with 4 bonus tracks on a third disc...as well as the splendid song 'Brilliant Trees', it includes two versions of 'Scent of Magnolia' and 'The Blinding Light of Heaven' from the collaboration with Robert Fripp.
B00000BKDY|5.0|This was the first Maiden album I got and it is definately one of my desert island disks.  In fact, I have purchased this album 4 times.  Once on casette, once on the original CD run, once when the second run w/singles came out, and finally in it's current version.  Each time I have liked it just as much as when I first got it.<br />For me, this album really defined what Maiden could do with guitars.  Dave and Adrian play very tightly on this album and they lightened up their distorted sound with some chorus to kind of give a spacey sound to it (which fits in with the album theme nicely).  It also has my second favorite (although under-appreciated by most) Maiden song, The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner.<br />Bruce's singing on this album is excellent and is really the last time that he could handle the high notes cleanly.<br />This album is one of the 3 from Maiden's glory years (Powerslave, Somewhere in Time, and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son).  If you are missing any of these, remedy the situation immediately.<br />The popular live songs are:  Wasted Years, and Stranger in a Strange Land.
B00002MZ2C|4.0|I enjoy the music on this CD.  It is a finely crafted performance.  Tom Morello creates a compelling aural landscape, exploring the outter reaches of guitar sound.  TESTIFY, CALM LIKE A BOMB, and ASHES IN THE FALL each feature a glissando which is controlled chaos that could slip away from less nimble fingers.  My favourite songs are those which have RATM in a solid funk groove, as on CLAB, BORN OF A BROKEN MAN and NEW MILLENNIUM HOMES.  This heavy construction aggro-hip-hop provides the perfect platform for Zack's precisely, punctuated, politically powered, philippic poetry.  RATM are an easy target for jaded criticism which suggests they sing songs about other peoples' problems.  A quick glance at the luxury cars in the parking lots of their concerts betrays the &quot;rebel&quot; facade of their audiences.  It may be posing, but it's not vapid, and the band is sincere.  Zack and crew fuel &quot;tha fire only [Bob] Marley could catch&quot;. Even if their audience has never been oppressed, they are shown how to put their affluence to support those less fortunate.  On the last page of the notes are listed nearly a dozen organizations who fight for the rights of those about whom RATM sings.  If you are interested in aggro-hip-hop heavy metal with politically motivated lyrics, this CD will interest you.  Even if you don't, you may be interested in helping the organizations which can benefit from your support. Peace.
B00004W56S|4.0|Mike Rutherford's first solo album, &quot;Smallcreep's Day&quot;, is a well laid-out piece of work from start to finish. Noel McCalla does a fine job on vocals, which are perfectly suited for the tracks on this album, some of which display a &quot;Mike &amp; The Mechanics&quot; vibe, and somewhat better. There are too many good tracks here to determine which ones stand out, but if I had to choose, it would probably be &quot;Moonshine&quot; because of its up-tempo, hard-edged feel. Gems like &quot;Smallcreep's Day&quot; are hard to come by, so any die-hard Genesis and/or Mike &amp; The Mechanics fan should include this one in their CD collection before it goes out of print.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I, a faithful fan of Sarah McLachlan never thought I would utter these words, but in all honesty, it's necessary. Dido has surpassed my expectations, and has taken the coveted number one spot in my CD collection. I listen to her CD at great lengths, more often than not, once a day. Such songs as &quot;Slide&quot;, and &quot;Thank You&quot; often give me goosebumps, which are accompanied by the need to close my eyes and feel the lyrics.<br />Each song on this album has it's worth, all are extrodinaryly written, and the composition is flawless. Not only does Dido's voice convey raw emotions, it's real. Something that a lot of singers these days lack.<br />I would strongly recommend this album to any music lover. Once you've heard it you won't be able to live without it.
B00004SCX6|3.0|I must admit when I first saw Oops I did it Again on MTV I knewI wanted to buy the album. I already had her first album, and thoughtotally devoid of any feeling (or depth for that matter) it had someoutstanding songs party like Crazy, etc. This album too has some orrather 2 good pieces on it.. Oops, and Lucky. I would suggest thatanyone who likes those 2 songs just buy the Lucky#2 Import Single, ithas both songs and a number of remixes and also includes the video for&quot;Oops I did it again&quot;.However the rest of the album is justfiller and might as well be absent from the disc.Particulary bad isthe remake of the Rolling Stones song &quot;I can't get nosatisfaction&quot;. Whenever it starts to play I want to throwsomething at the CD player, and scream.  If you are looking to find ameaningful album by an intresting, invintive young artist, I can onlywonder why you are reading this. With the exception of Lucky(which Ido believe has some meaning)the album is just filled with more of thesame old Britney stuff. Britney herself has changed little between thetwo albums,... She still sings the same, giving the same ditzy, thoughslightly less innocent feeling to the work.......................................................  So If youliked her first album, and are not looking for a talented artist ormeaningful songs, &quot;Oops I did it Again&quot; is probably foryou....         Rating C END
0060977493|5.0|I picture in my head an Indian version of Bette Davis in &quot;Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; whenever I think of Baby Kochamma, the bitter and twisted spinster aunt in this story. Roy's writing is so beautifully descriptive that hundreds of other associations sprang to mind while I read. Guilt, frustrated passion, familial relationships (especially between twins), jealousy and a myriad of other emotions all built up during the course of the novel. The cause, the death of Sophie Mol, happens so simply and yet it's consequences are so catastrophic. This is a novel that is both beautiful and depressing at the same time. All of it is so connected, I must go back and read it again.
0767814622|1.0|It does NOT mean that this is a real story just because Billy Hayes says so! Awful film in terms of any aspect. I had lived in Turkey, in many different regions for 30 years. There is nothing 'real' in that film!
6305350205|2.0|Oh, I can credit Star Trek V for trying to be the most personal film of the series, and the most spiritual.  If tehre's one merit I can give it, it is the fact that it does feature some good old-fashioned humor that is truly funny.  The setup itself is actually quite good.  So why does this film have a rather low rating?<br />Well, there are the special effects, which are absolutely awful.  These effects are reasonably better than films from the 1950's but this is unforgivable in comparison to any other Star Trek film.  The Star Trek Enterprise looks more like a toy model than a starship.<br />The pacing is rather slow, due mostly to the clumsy action scenes, which are more of a bore than anything else, but the biggest fault is saved for last.  When I read about this film, I pictured the planet which &quot;God&quot; lived on to look lush and beautiful, something like Genesis from Star Trek III, only even more breathtaking and wondrous.  Instead of beautiful scenery, we get a barren landscape.  The confrontation at the end is also rather anticlimactic.  Though it is interesting to note that the ending might be implying that the entity the crew encounters is actually the Devil (but it's never actually clarified). <br />This is a film that features good ideas, but it just doesn't seem to know what to do with them.  I'm not even sure Trekkie fans will enjoy it.
B000001FDK|5.0|This CD is great, it has all of the wonderful songs and they sound awesome, whenever I have the blues, I can just put this CD in and it will cheer me up right away because when you are listening to the songs, you can picture the scene in the movie and it always brings a smile to my face, If you liked the movie, or even if you didn't you will like this CD.
0399146253|3.0|After reading this book, I find myself asking one simple question.  What is Patricia Cornwell trying to accomplish?  On one hand, she seems intent on taking the Scarpetta series in a new direction.  This avenue seems to be focusing on The Last Precinct, a murky organization founded in part by Scarpetta's niece Lucy.  However, the reader is given no definitive reasons for the organization's existence or even a clear explanation for why it was mentioned in the first place.  In addition, there are so many loose ends that are never dealt with.  Why does Cornwell feel compelled to mention the excavation at Jamestown when it clearly does not do anything to enhance any aspect of her story?  As well, there is also a grand jury investigation centering on Kay Scarpetta's possible involvement in a murder.  The charges levelled against her are so far fetched that the reader is left feeling insulted by the incredible leaps of logic that Cornwell has taken with the storyline.<br />The most promising aspect of this novel were the chapters dealing with Scarpetta's sessions with her good friend Anna Zenner, an Austrian psychiatrist.  For the first time, the reader is given an in depth portrait of Scarpetta's feelings regarding those she knows and loves.  But even that is overshadowed by the decidedly odd, even uncomfortable, tone of the sessions themselves.  It does not seem that it is Scarpetta who is being laid bare before the reader's eyes, but Cornwell herself.<br />I certainly admire Cornwell for taking the Scarpetta series into new and uncharted territory.  Despite the rather disjointed way in which she has chosen to accomplish this feat, it will hopefully breathe new life into a series that has taken some rather nasty hits in the past couple of outings. Patricia Cornwell is certainly capable of delivering a sharp, tightly constructed and riveting storyline.  Let us hope her change of direction will allow her to do just that.
0780631684|5.0|The most unpredictable plot that I have seen in a long time.  This movie knows no boundaries.  The deaths are interesting and shocking.  Some scenes have to be seen to be believed.  The acting is very good and not overdone.  This is a must see thriller!
B00000G3Q4|5.0|A classic in the cheesy horror genre, with thrills, gore, and some wicked humor.  The DVD is very very good, with some great clips of filming it.  A must have for horror fans!
0446604844|1.0|This book is just like any other John Grisham or Patricia Cornball pot boiler. It is pulp fiction of the lowest order. All the characters are cardboard cut-outs: the FBI are big, tough guys who wear sunglasses in the dark and indoors; CEOs fly around in Lear Jets killing people; lawyers also fly around in Lear Jets and act unlike any lawyer in history; and assassins kill expertly until it comes to the heroine who they just can't seem to kill (mmm, wonder why).<br />Baldacci is one of those authors who has clearly done a lot of research, but he feels he needs to include all this research into the novel, even if it is boring, trite and unnecessary - which it always is. As an example we are treated to pages and pages of boring guff about the Federal Bank and how it effectively controls the lifes of all Americans. It is just a longwinded section of exposition that gets us nowhere. Even worse is the long explanation about how computers give off radiation and how images on monitors are made up of pixels. Wow! And this is all introduced at a time when the heroine is desperate to download some info from a disc and does not need to have this explained, so why the pages of exposition? I can only think it's to slow down the already turgid narrative and to pad out the book further.<br />The ending is also one long stream of exposition as our macho FBI agent tells us the reader, via one of the baddies, the whole convoluted plot. It takes pages and pages to spell out the plot I had been trying to follow.<br />...I couldn't really care about any of the characters in this as they were so paper thin - the FBI hero, Lee Sawyer, is so cliched even down to the sleeping problems, divorced wife, children who hate him, dark sunglasses worn at night, etc etc etc. Yawn!<br />I also objected to the way the husband character disappears from the story never to be mentioned again apart from when his death is raised at the end.<br />If this was to be made into a film it wouldn't break new ground, it would be just as bog-standard as all the other mainstream Hollywood thrillers based on books like The Firm and The Pelican Brief. Let's hope it never sees the light of day.
B0000214F3|5.0|A film in which Death is one of the principal characters seems an odd contrast with the beautifully done life-affirming message of this film. Like all really great art, the message here, loud and clear, is that decency and honor and compassion and love are precious, that the people we love are precious, and that being a slimy SOB only wins you more toys in the very short run. The romance that develops (and her hesitancy and fear of being hurt again) felt real. Wonderful acting all around, but Brad Pitt showed a range as his character learned how to live and to fall in love that suggests Pitt is larger than the &quot;sexiest man&quot; supermaket tabloid garbage. This movie will make you want to find someone you love and gratefully hold each other for a long, long time. It made me cry the way I haven't done over a film in quite a while. Very upbeat, sweet, and romantic!
0780631684|5.0|When I first heard about this movie I thought it wouldn't be very good. But now that I rented it I thought it was awesome! It has good actors in it like Devon Sawa (Little Giants and Idol Hands), Seann William Scott (American Pie and Road Trip), and Ali Larter (Varsity Blues and House on Haunted Hill) and of course there are some other actors too but I'm not going to name them all. This is a very good movie. Go rent it and you will like it!
B00000AOUD|5.0|&quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; opens with sheer simplicity,the superlative singular voice of Ian Anderson accompanied by his acoustic guitar. Gradually the music builds up in a seemingly spontaneous yet very deliberate manner, a successful marriage of a host of instruments. Guitars, various keyboard instruments, percussion and flute carry on a lively conversation with each other that can only be described as stream of consciousness, each vying with the other for center stage, the flute appearing and disappearing like some sort of ethereal being. It is at times a bit unpolished, filled with an unbridled energy that is eventually harnessed in the more sophisticated &quot;Passion Play&quot;. Yet this adds to rather than detracting from the piece, complimenting the image of fearless youth unencumbered by expectation that is further developed in the lyrics. It is an anthem of sorts, the angst of thoughtful youth set to provocative yet lyrical music. You will not find a logical progression of ideas here, but rather a collection of thoughts and images eloquently rendered, at times brilliant, at times obtuse, always reflective of the twenty-something year old man who wrote them. It is to me a celebration of youth, of the roller coaster of emotions and thoughts that waxed and waned in all of us with varying degrees of intensity and importance, defining who we were and what we were to become. As with our own psyches, the music expands and becomes almost calamitous before dissolving into the supremely simple refrain that started it all.<br />This edition of &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; also includes two more tracks, a live version and an interview with Ian, Martin and Jeffrey about the making of the album. While nothing compares to being able to listen to the whole piece, uninterrupted (use headphones!), hearing it &quot;live&quot; with the reaction of the crowd brought back wonderful memories of simpler times, when a concert such as this was a much anticipated event. I rememberrelishing every moment, basking in the reflected glory of the band and going home to discuss every nuance, ad nauseam, with my like minded cronies. Sitting now in the comfort of my home, cognac in hand,I cannot help but notice how much Ian's flute playing improved in the six years between the original album and this recorded concert, perhaps a hint of things to come. The interview is humorous and illuminating, especially with regards to the incredibly short time it took to write and record this remarkable album.<br />In short, I really do mind if you sit this one out. Buy it and really listen. You will not be disappointed.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|This is cd is full of beautiful songs.  It's very easy to like.
B00004U2A1|5.0|A classic for horror fans with a gory sense of humor.  Cheesy, gory, and less scary though even funnier than The Evil Dead (sort of a funnier remake than really a sequel).  The Special Edition DVD is a must have for Evil Dead fans, or fans or the genre!
0399146253|2.0|I'm only half way thru this one,and I've never heard so much&quot;Bellyaching&quot;!  Poor Kay, she's getting old!  Most of the bookso far, is full of discriptive adjectives on how terrible she feels about everything and every one.P.C. has always been one of my favorites, but I&quot;m going to haveto nickname her &quot;The Queen of Superlatives&quot;. The best part of this book is the picture on the back of thebook jacket.
B00003CX8J|5.0|This film used some of the best effects I've ever seen, which really added to it's believability in a real-life format.  It's a film for adults more than children, but certainly both audiences will love it.  The depth of storyline and character development was well-planned and the ending is left wide open for a sequel.  Honestly, I believe a lot of people will be wanting a sequel for this one, especially after having seen the audience reaction to it in England (where I happened to watch it for the first time).        As an English major, I found the storyline entriguingly original and well thought out.  The actors proved their determination to get into character and the special effects helped to pull the audience into this world.  I can't wait for the DVD!
B000002JEV|5.0|A set of live studio recordings such as these demonstrate how powerful Led Zeppelin were.  The music, especially on the first cd is energetic and hard.  You can hear a few Muddy Waters lines in &quot;I can't quit you baby,&quot; and lots of Robert Johnson lines throughout.  The original Johnson recording of &quot;Travelin' Riverside Blues&quot; has different lyrics to it, so the version Zeppelin does here seems to be kind of a Robert Johnson medley of sorts, but it still comes off great.  Now that I've listened to these, I've found it hard to listen to some of their studio recordings because they lack the power and energy these have, especially &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot; and &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot;.  The second cd has its moments as well, but casual fans might not appreciate an 18-minute version of &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;; I like it, with all the bowed guitar and all.  Anyone familiar with the old blues greats will appreciate famous little blues lyric lines Plant throws in from time to time, and anyone who wants to hear not only Led Zeppelin at their best, but rock at it's best will enjoy this album.
0783243499|5.0|While watching this film I was astonished. This film is  very gruesome and grisly and it almost made my stomach turn. And if the whole film were based on violence and only violence then I probably would not have enjoyed it as much as I did. This film is not just about murder, it is about a man, (although he really doesn't even call himself a human being) who is pushed over the edge by the smallest things, if someone has a better penthouse, or a better business card, or even a better suit this is grounds for murder. He tells us that he has all of the characteristics of a human being but none of the emotional feelings. His only feelings are of lust and greed and he only cares for himself. It really gives you insight into his mind and he really explains why he is so violent. note: this film is definitely not for anyone under the age of 18!!
B000000ORE|4.0|Of the studio albums Tesla has produced, I love &quot;Great radio controversy&quot;. This album may have been overshadowed by the release of better known (at the time) Def Leppard and their album &quot;Hysteria&quot;. However, Tesla countered with probably one of the best written ballads amomg heavier rock bands &quot;the Love song&quot;. I also found &quot;paradise&quot; to be just as powerful. &quot;did it for the money&quot; is another fav of mine. I love the high energy of the album. When I heard &quot;the way it is&quot; I was sold on the cd. I think you will be too. I you like Queensryche, you'll like Tesla. Great band.
B00000163G|3.0|2pac's intellect was clearly of a high level- you can tell thisfrom the thought of his lyrics-----they spoke the truth, rather thanthe usual type of rap submitted by many rappers. This is clearly illustrated on this album. This album also gives 2pac a chance air his frustration at the negative energy of others. If you like dark rap, with fecculent language,then this album is perfect. You will particuly enjoy 'ambitionaz az a ridah'  'no more pain'. PUT YA MOUTH ON THA PISTOL he screams in 'no more pain'. Obviously an angry man as he had just been released from jail when recording began for the album. In conclusion this album ain't tha best from 2pac but still good!
0812589041|5.0|<BR> The background of the storyline is of a young boy, one of a large group, bred to be supergeniuses as Earth's last desperate attempt to find a military genius that can defeat an alien race that we are in an interstellar war with. Hundreds of planets and billions of humans have been lost and only Earth and a handful of planets remain. <BR> <BR> This is where Ender's story begins. <BR> <BR> Ender is sent into training doing battle simulation after battle simulation, against ever increasing, nearly impossible odds. Ender keeps finding ways to win the battles, but what makes the book impossible to put down is that the military officers in charge of Ender's training do everything in their power to socially isolate Ender from the other boys in the academy. And to top it all off they add the pyschological pressure of letting Ender know that time has ran out - Ender is humanity's last hope. There isn't time to find another child prodigy and train him - humanity has only a few precious months to finish training Ender and his fellow students and then the final battle will be waged to determine if humanity survives. <BR> <BR> <BR> SIDE NOTE:  Just to let you know how good this book is, I had a girlfriend that hadn't read more than 10 books of personal reading in her life when I met her. Over Christmas break from college, I told her that she should start reading Ender's Game, since she said she would as soon as Fall Quarter ended. She said that she just wanted to relax that evening and not have to do anything. Since I had found that no one can read the first 40 pages of this book and put it down, I turned off the tv and read the first 40 pages of the book to her. I then announced that I was going to bed and left the book on the coffee table in front of her. <BR>    I woke up the next morning to find her asleep on the couch with Ender's game in her lap. When she awoke, she had VERY RED eyes, and was upset that she couldn't ignore the book and stayed up until around 5 AM until she collapsed from exhaustion. She said that she was irritated that she wouldn't get any sleep that night either because she had to finish reading the book!
B000002A3T|5.0|I am a huge fan of Pink Floyd and David Gilmour.  I like Roger Waters as well.  This album sounds (as it really is) a Gilmour solo effort with little imput from Wright and NONE from Mason (see album jacket credits).  This to me sounds like David Gilmours, About Face solo album.  I see little Pink Floyd in this.  Unlike Momentary Laspe, there is no Water/old Floyd Feel to it.  However, it is a great album for Gilmour slanted fans.
B000002GBD|5.0|No other way to descibe it. Every song talks to those that are fresh off a romance gone bad. When guests happen to glance at your cd library and see you owning Nazareth's &quot;Hair of the dog&quot; They will probably figure you got pooped on at one time or another, LOL. In reality &quot;Hair of the dog&quot; the band's signature effort and it is an outstanding one. my favs are &quot;miss misery&quot;, &quot;beggar's day&quot; &quot;rose in the heather&quot;. Whether You want to ease the pain of a love gone south, or promote conversation at your parties, &quot;Hair of the dog&quot; is sure to make you a hit. I gave it 5 out of 5 stars because its a classic.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|This is an album I've had for years and come back to over and over again. This is a driving in the rain album, a fall day album, a 3:00 AM and can't sleep album. For me, it expresses a mood better than any other CD I own.<br />By all means, do yourself a favor and buy it, even if you're not a Dire Straits fan. I can't imagaine you'll be sorry.
B00004W5UA|1.0|This movie is a testament to the fact that Hollywood is running out of things to make movies about.  This is a failed attempt to combine a few previously used successful movie ideas into a sleeper of a flick.  The movie starts of slow and you lose interest by the time anything of moderate excitement happens.  The hype is just hype.  The only thing dumber that this movie is the kids who imitate it by beating each other up. A poor idea sold with Brad Pitt's name.  Over-rated-take a nap.
0838577016|5.0|This is a tremendous book.  I've been using it for teaching since the 2nd edition.  I don't know where or how Dr. Kandel (a brand-new Nobel winner) and his co-authors find the time to update this along with all the other writing and research they do, but it's great that they do.  The illustrations have caught up to the computer age and are even better than before.  The price is astonishing for a medical or graduate school textbook - really a great value.
B000002H97|5.0|Just as my title says, believe the hype. Though I certainly don't think this is their best (that title is held by &quot;Master Of Puppets&quot;), this isn't all that far off. This is the first album of Metallica's that I listened to (my dad was the one who got me into them, and what better gift for a great dad to give to his son?). I don't think I have to say much about the singles, as everyone and their uncle has heard them, but I'll make a quick mention nonetheless. &quot;Enter Sandman,&quot; &quot;Sad But True,&quot; &quot;The Unforgiven,&quot; &quot;Wherever I May Roam,&quot; and &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; are all Rock classics. And for great reason: they're perfect songs. My favorite of these singles is &quot;The Unforgiven.&quot; It's beautiful, amazing, delicate, and angry--I suppose no mere words could do the song justice, but I'm sure you get the point though. I know what you're thinking: &quot;yeah, okay, we all know the singles are great, but how's the rest of the album?&quot; Surprisingly, it holds up with the singles. &quot;Holier Than Thou&quot; is pure thrash aggression, like something off of &quot;Master Of Puppets.&quot; &quot;Don't Tread On Me&quot; has some Metallica fans confused given the lyrics (it is surprising given &quot;...And Justice For All&quot;), but it's a great song nonetheless. &quot;Through The Never&quot; is another aggressive track, not unlike &quot;Holier Than Thou.&quot; &quot;Of Wolf And Man&quot; is along the lines of &quot;Sad But True,&quot; a great rhythm section. &quot;The God That Falied&quot; might be my favorite non-single off the album (&quot;Holier Than Thou&quot; and &quot;My Friend Of Misery&quot; are the other contenders). I love the lyrics to this song. James has never been one to hold back when dealing with God, but this might be his most vicious song to date. And that is why I love it so much, James' is telling it exactly like it is. &quot;My Friend Of Misery&quot; is probably the most depressing song here. It's just really sad, but a great song. &quot;The Black Album&quot; ends perfectly with &quot;The Struggle Within.&quot; The barked lyrics are a spectacular touch. Mean rhythm sections, rip-roaring solos, throbbing bass, pounding drums, potent lyrics and beautiful and vicious vocals--these are the ingredients for this masterpiece. Just like another masterpiece released in '91, Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind,&quot; &quot;The Black Album&quot; makes a perfect album out of the bare essentials (guitars, drums, and bass). So much has been said about &quot;The Black Album&quot; now that even saying it's name is redundant. I wish I could add something new to all that's been said, but I just can't. So if you're one of the five or so Metal-heads out there that don't own this yet, there's absolutely no reason why you shouldn't buy it now (actually, I don't think there's such a thing as being a Metal-head and not owning at least one Metallica album). The best Metal album of the '90s? Of course.
0064407667|5.0|This is a great book.It is very well written. You'll never guess what is going to happen next. The writting covers up for all the horrid things that happen. I strongly suggest this book to children around my age of ten.
B00004YA66|5.0|I bought Frequency last week on DVD and didn't know what to expect. But I wasn't disappointed. This movie is absolutely fantastic. It's a suspenseful thriller with a touch of family-feeling and the question of wether or not you should change the past. This may sound a little old-fashioned but it's not. This is one of the movies I will remember for a long time and watch for many, many times. Again, and again, and again...
0671034065|3.0|first of all i have to say that i love most of linda howard's books. but this one was not one of her best. when came it came to romance not half as good as shades of twilight and when it came to suspense not half as good as dream man.  i think that ms howard should stick with for usual writing style. the humor was good and would love to more of that in future books. i didn't like the way she wrote only from the heroine's perspective. the didn't seem to have any dept and unlike her other books you are not transported into the pages. i thing this book was more romance than suspense and the romance was not that great! romance novels should be more romantic not with a heroine that has been in love a number of times.
B00000IQC8|5.0|Go see this movie.  Go buy this movie.  The only reason I don't own this movie is that I live with my parents.  That barrier will not hold up for long because this movie is beyond awesome.  Rarely in my reviews will I gush like this, I promise.  But Clerks... why don't those fools up in DVDLand make a Kevin Smith Collection?!  Actually, his other movies don't even come close to the genuis of Clerks.  Two very bored guys have a very interesting day.  In black and white.  That's it.  That's also part of Kevin Smith's genuis.  He's at his best when it's just two guys talking about the deeper moral dilemmas in Return of the Jedi.<br />I could go on and on and on...but I won't.  Go see Clerks.  Go buy Clerks.  You will buy Clerks...
B00004WC6J|5.0|What more can one ask for?  I do not understand how anyone who has enjoyed David Sylvian's work over the years could not like this collection.  The limited edition import includes a very cool EP and elaborate packaging, opt for this version if you have the funds to spare.

The only good songs are the rap version of rollin and it'll be OK (which is inspired by kurt cobain). Most of the songs are the same format as significant other. There best cd is three dollar bill yall so you should get that if you really need a limp bizkit cd otherwise spend your mony on a good cd like Deftones white pony or Slipknot.
B000000H4V|3.0|The Boys from Brazil were well established in the thrash camp, but they weren't afraid to experiment. Even on their heaviest tracks, they blended in Brazilian tribal rhythms, as on the stark instrumental 'Kaiowas'. Songs with serious, informed lyrics about lands being torn asunder by war, greed, and corruption. 'Biotech is Godzilla' will appeal to those who like it dark and brutally fast, and the lyrics written by Dead Kennedy's Jello Biafra warn about the consequences of bio-technology in the wrong hands. Sepultura could arguably claim the cap of thinking man's thrash band.
B00003CX8J|4.0|I must say this first: I have never in my life read an X-Men comic book.  Having said that, I had a great time watching this movie.  It was deeper than I expected; instead of being merely a series of special effects-laden mutant-versus-mutant battles (though, needless to say, there are plenty of those), the storyline is really quite involving and thoughtful, the acting is superb (Jackman rocks the house), and when it gets down to the electrifying action, you won't be dissapointed.  My only complaint here is that the movie is too short; it leaves plenty of room for the inevitable sequel(s).<br />I'm getting impatient, too...
B000002IWQ|4.0|'Counterparts' was the strongest Rush album since 1985's 'Power Windows', though it's reminiscent of an earlier effort, 1981's 'Moving Pictures'. Peter Collins' gritty, hard and dry production helps to put the bite back into the Canadian 3-piece, giving them a 90s frisson. High points are the cut and thrust of songs like 'Animate' and 'Stick It Out' and, by way of contrast, the sweeping 'Nobody's Hero', which includes a string arrangement. The latter half of the record lacks the drive and focus of the first half, but nevertheless 'Counterparts' is a consistently pleasing listening experience.
B00003CXHJ|4.0|If you've seen Wolfgang Petersen's harrowing tale of the brutal reality of submarine combat in World War Two, you probably either loved it for its spot-on realism or wished it had been a little more entertaining and less intent on having the same phsychological effect on the audience as on the crew.  U-571 is for those of you in that second group.  It is an intense, perfectly-paced thriller whose only real &quot;flaw&quot; is that it is somewhat unrealistic in terms of historical effects.  You could cut the air (water?) with a knife during the action sequences, regardless of whether or not you take into account the unlikelyhood of the whole thing.  Good acting and casting all around, to boot.  I'm also sure that the movie will benefit from the crisp DVD format. A tad cliched, but sure to appeal to thrill-seekers (if not to you nit-picking realism buffs).
0375701427|5.0|Philip Roth won the Pulitzer Prize for this riveting, quietly horrifying novel that shatters the idyllic illusion of an America that once might have been, but will be no more.  American Pastoral is a brilliant commentary on our inability to effectively see beneath the surface of apparent well-being and contentment in others.  The first of the &quot;Zuckerman trilogy,&quot; (which ends with The Human Stain), American Pastoral recalls and builds on Roth's most accomplished and self-referential fiction of the past.<br />As the novel opens, Skip Zuckerman, the childless, unattached, first-person narrator of the trilogy has a chance meeting with a boyhood hero at a baseball game.  This hero is Swede Levov, an older man who is still, impossibly blonde, blue-eyed and youthful; a legend within his predominantly Jewish neighborhood.  Swede is the very embodiment of &quot;America&quot; and all that &quot;being American&quot; stands for.  He is, Skip is sure, incapable of living anything but the perfect, and perfectly rewarding, life.<br />Swede's brother, Jerry, was Skip's best friend, so when Swede asks for a meeting with Skip, Skip is a little puzzled but not all that surprised.  Swede, however, doesn't ask anything specific of Skip, but talks of his sons and his memories of Newark before and during World War II.  This meeting, though, is pivotal to the novel's central question and its meaning soon becomes crystal clear.<br />As the novel progresses, Skip attends his high school reunion and, while making note of the various deficiencies shared by the sixtyish men and women in attendance, becomes convinced that no human being ever really knows or understands another.  He is depressed by all the conversation about cancer, divorce and the various problems associated with growing older.  It is Jerry, though, Swede's brother, who tells Skip the one thing that will disillusion more than any other.<br />Roth's brilliance as well as his masterful and well-crafted prose draw us intoAmerican Pastoral and allow us to participate in the mundane life experiences of its characters as if those experiences were our very own.  We live through school reunions, failed marriages, duplicity and waste as Skip proceeds to a more detailed examination of the life of Swede Levov.<br />Swede's life, Skip finds out, was nothing like he had imagined it would be.  Obsessed, Skip begins a novel that focuses on the life of Swede Levov.  Although Skip is making up a lot of his book as he goes along, the story is nonetheless true and it is a story that will resonate painfully with anyone who has ever felt alone, in control, out of control, or who has thought that he or she knew all about someone they have cared about deeply.  As the facts about Swede Levov's life slowly unfold, as his secrets are unearthed, the glossy veneer of satisfaction, contentment and perfection begins to slip away from his life.  As the man behind the persona is fully revealed, we come to realize, with Skip Zuckerman, that in anyone's life, one torment can, and often does, lead to more and more agony until its inevitability is appalling.<br />American Pastoral is more of an impassioned dialogue with its readers than a convincing and linear story.  This is not a warm and comforting book that will leave a glow in your heart after the last page.  In fact, its most convincing and most powerfully-written passages are those in which Swede and Skip discuss and reflect upon human nature's congenital loneliness.<br />American Pastoral is a painful book; it is a book that explores a dark and lonely side of human nature.  But it is masterfully written, in prose that is spare and elegant and, above all, authentic.  At its heart, American Pastoral is a gorgeous elegy for the American Dream; a funeral ode to an innocence that has long since passed away.
B000002KB8|5.0|The debut may not be their best technical album, but it is for sure the most anthemic, symbolic and representative of a new huge movement which had just started. Black Sabbath's and all their brethren's music was born to be immortalized. Whatever... This album is still bluesy, and that adds a special flavour to it. The solos on &quot;The Warning&quot; are insane. The bass line on &quot;NIB&quot; is hypnotizing, the title track is so strong! &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;, the album, is the top jewel of my classic metal collection.
B000002UJQ|5.0|The first time i listened to ok computer, i was intrigued and confussed at the same time, i couldn´t understand what was going on in thom yorke´s life to write such sad and beautifully sincere lyrics, and i also didn´t understood the album completely.<br />It wasn´t until the day after that i sat down, with the lyrics on one hand, and a cigarrette in the other, that i got into the album, it was so beautiful and sad that i inevitably cried, especially during &quot;exit music for a film&quot; and &quot;paranoid android&quot;.<br />Since that moment this cd is priceless in my life, it contains some of the best lyrics since the late Kurt Cobain, and a some of the most memorable music moments of the decade.<br />I recomend this record to any music lover, and to any sincere heart.

B00004ZD69|5.0|...but is a tool of the emotion.  The opening, including Gathering Storm, is the essence of GYBE!, humble beginnings rapidly evolving into terrible crescendos.  The experience is like being towed through dark water by an invisible force.  Turns take place over many minutes, but seem sudden.  It is not emotional, but it tugs at your emotions, pulling and pushing.<br />The first movement ends transparently, and you hear a recording of &quot;Welcome to Barco AM/PM.&quot;  Trademark of GYBE, the recording is intentionally staticy and very urban, but if you listen to the recording carefully you suddenly realize the sociopolitical intent.<br />This recording is not sad or joyful.  It is up to the listener to be moved in such directions by the music.

B00004XONN|3.0|I am sick of reading reviews that say &quot;...and those who don't like this album obviously don't understand music at all...&quot;<br />That is so...wrong.<br />Regardless of how great an album is (and I don't really think KID A is all that great), it is composed of nothing more than various arrangements of notes and sounds. You are not hearing anything that the rest of us are not hearing. If you get a lot out of the album, good for you. If you don't, there's nothing wrong with you. Everyone has different opinions, and insulting someone who doesn't &quot;understand&quot; an album is...stupid.
B00004YW6I|1.0|Reading the reviews and listening to the album I get confused because itis, surprisingly, just a remake of her excellent album &quot;Dry&quot; of... 1993! It seems that, along with U2's latest, she is getting back to her roots. If that is all she could extract musically and creatively from living in New York in the last year, then I would conclude that is a lot of hype for nothing. Ifyou still want to listen to PJ,start with &quot;Dry&quot; and this latest is not at all compulsory.
0198711905|4.0|I am specifically reviewing &quot;The Oxford William Shakespeare The Complete Works--Compact Edition.&quot;  In 1986 Oxford University Press published three volumes of its Complete Shakespeare: a modernized edition, an original spelling edition, and a textual companion.  These three won general acclaim though some, say Eric Sams and Harold Bloom have expressed dissatisfaction. The original spelling edition is long out of print, and is highly prized by collectors.  The textual companion is in print, but not by OUP, by Norton.  That leaves the only the modernized edition in print by OUP.  It is currently available in a compact hardcover edition, though a paperback edition is available in the United Kingdom.  One of the general editors Stanley Wells wrote a good general introduction, but the introductions to individual plays are skimpy, generally not longer than a page, and not enough space is given over to the specific textual problems of each play.  The plays are printed in a proposed chronological order.  Because we do not know for certain which plays were written when, and in which order, the order is nothing more than the editors' best guess.  The plays are printed in double columns and in a type size which looks like it is about 10 point size. The type looks small. I made a quick estimate and I found that there were about 90 lines on each page. The lines are numbered by five, except where a long line will bump the number to the next line.<br />  Unlike some other complete editions if you are stuck on a difficlult passage you are left to your own devices.  There a no footnotes, and the words in the glossary at the end are not keyed to any particular passage. The Oxford text does not lend itself to this kind of naked presentation.<br />  The editors are very free with their use of early quarto and folio texts.  Their editorial policy is flexible, so flexible that some could say it is inconsistent. For example with &quot;King Lear&quot; we get two versions, quarto and folio.  These versions are of limited usefulness because readings from one version are freely introduced into the other and vis-a-versa, but with &quot;Henry V&quot; we get conflated version of the play where readings from the quarto are sometimes preferred to the superior folio text.<br />  Above I gave the the compact edition four stars.  I should by more specific.  For uncritical readers I give this edition three stars. For critical readers I give  four stars. And  for critical readers who read it in conjunction with &quot;William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion&quot; I give five stars.t; we get two versions, quarto and folio.

B00000IQBM|4.0|This is probably one of the best and most remembered horror movies made. Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance fits just a little too well. Stanley Kubrick's overview of the mountains of Colorado makes the viewer feel like a voyeur of an unfolding tragedy, and nothing is even going on. The use of Bela Bartok's music and other original scores alone will make your blood run cold. There are many good elements to this sophisticated movie. &quot;The Shining&quot; is one of the few movies where it's better than the book. One of the creepiest elements of the movie, the maze chase scenes, were completely non-existent in the book. Plus, the story went better for me with a visual aid; i just could not picture a place as big as the Overlook Hotel in my mind. Also, the book obviously doesn't feature the spellbinding music. However, the book doesn't totally surpass the movie. The film version features complicated plot and character turns that never seem to get explained, which is annoying to me.<br />Even though the movie is great, it runs a bit too long, and is somewhat too slow-paced. Perhaps a condensed version would make this film a masterpiece. i definitely recommend this for horror movie fans, but don't walk into it thinking you'll see a whole bunch of blood, guts, and murder (or &quot;redrum&quot; as Danny refers to it). This movie is scary because it messes with your head and makes you think about what it happening.  In a nutshell, this is a movie that belongs in the memory bank of everyone out for a good horror pic.

B00004YX39|5.0|And so we come to what must be the end of the Steely Dan remasters.  'Gaucho' was the last Dan/Fagen album to be recorded in analogue.<br />So now have the most sonically perfect versions of seven diamond-encrusted albums, with not a single dud track on any of them.  The Dan's approach to remasters has differed from some: of course we have the sleeve notes from the artists, and in the Dan's case, they are as obscure as you would expect, giving you a vital perspective on what has going on at the time of the recording without actually telling you what was going on.  But unlike, say the Deep Purple remasters, you don't get any extra tracks to give an indication of tunes or versions that were rejected.<br />This is a brilliant album, featuring many of the great guitar, brass and reed players of the time.  Dire Straits's Mark Knopfler even turns up for a guitar solo on &quot;Time out of Mind&quot;.  Steve Khan (remember him?) does most of the solo guitar work, and does it extremely well.  Larry Carlton provides one heavenly solo, on the final track &quot;Third World Man&quot;.  The legend that this solo was lying unused in the Dan vaults for years may be true -- it seems a suitably elliptic way of ending the series of seven gems that made up the output of Dan phase 1.<br />I don't understand why the copyright notices say '1984' and '2000' when this album originally came out in 1980.
0679879269|5.0|There were so many moments during this book when I felt as if my heart were being wrenched away. And yet Pullman managed to bring this trilogy to an absolutely beautiful conclusion without being the slightest bit cheesy, which is an astounding feat in and of itself. His descriptions of the love between the young heroes are unlike any I have ever read, and his understanding of the subtle changes which mark the transition from childhood to adulthood, and the significance thereof, was simply astounding. Pullman managed to not only make sense of the worlds that he created in this trilogy, but allows us to bring his insights back into our own world and keep them!  I am grieviously sorry that the trilogy is over (and yet how could it not be?) but I look forward to sharing the wonder of these books with my very lucky friends.
0671798154|4.0|Jack Cray, the American assassin sent deep into Germany during the The Third Reich's final days, is the focus point of this gripping WWII thriller. There is romance, and action, and suspense abounding. Though several of the plot twists can be forseen by regular readers of this genre, it does not make the story any less fascinating in the telling. If you liked Daniel Silva's The Unlikely Spy or John Lee's The Ninth Man, you will enjoy this exciting tale of an indomitable American's spy mission to infiltrate the German high command. This page-turner is peopled with just the right mix of sinister Nazis who are always just a breath away from capturing the good guys who are working to save the free world. It was also interesting to read the unsettling descriptions of German civilan life during the closing days of the war, to see how the Nazi's war machine had so adversely affected the average German's life in so many ways. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys WWII spy thrillers.  A good one.
6304211740|2.0|True to the Miramax tradition the only thing this version of Jane Eyre has in common with the book are the names of the caracters.   The acting was wooden and uninspired, there was no chemistry between this Jane and Mr.Rochester and the story was changed so much, even Charlotte Brontee would not recognize it.    The Ciaran Hinds/ Samantha Morton version was much better. Ciaran Hinds certainly has the &quot;dark brooding&quot; looks of the original Mr. Rochester, and when he asks Jane if she finds him handsome, she could be truthful when she said no. This version showed some of the passion and the agony that both feel.  It is beond me to understand why directors spend millions to make a movie from a book, only to butcher the story beyond recognition. The classics have endured because of the ability   authors like Jane Austen, Charlotte Brontee and Charles Dickens have to bring people to life. The William Hurt version has succeded to reduce the caracters to become onedimentional.
0679879269|5.0|Because The Golden Compass was my favorite book, and because The Subtle Knife left me hanging, it was inevitable that I would be compelled to buy The Amber Spyglass. Braced for another exciting journey with the heroes, Lyra and Will, I was not disappointed. With every new twist and turn Philip Pullman led me through, I was so sure I knew what would happen next. Of course, I never did. The mystery of Mrs. Coulter's real intentions kept me on my toes, and the introduction of the Galvespians thrilled me. You'll never grow tired of Will and Lyra's adventures through the many worlds, and the ending will surprise you so much you'll have to go back and read it again. I stayed up all night just to find out what would happen, and all I can say is, you'll end up feeling just like Lyra and Will at the end of the book. The author's amazing ability to bring you into the book and feel exactly how the character is feeling always excites me. Though The Golden Compass remains at the top of my list, The Amber Spyglass is not to be missed. You must read the first two books, and I guarantee you, you'll want to read the third. Do yourself a favor, get a new look at life, and pick up this book.

B0000524E5|5.0|&quot;Coyote Ugly&quot; has to be the best romantic dramedy this year, even though this year has had it's share of bad romances-Autumn in New York, Down to You and The Next Best Thing just to name a few. The bar dancing scenes are incredible accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack including one of my favorites, &quot;Pour Some Sugar on Me&quot;. Plus there are two new great songs from LeAnn Rimes,who is also in the movie, but I'm not reviewing the soundtrack so I'll skip this. And that's just the stuff you see in the previews. What you don't see on the surface through the previews are the great performances from newcomer Piper Perabo, Adam Garcia and the always great John Goodman. the story is mainly about Piper Perabo's character, nicknamed Jersey, who goes into the big city trying to get someone to perform her well written songs. She runs into several problems with a new boyfriend, some disagreements with her father, and many crazy encounters at the bar &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot;. The title is explained in the movie to mean when you go home with a one night stand after a night of big drinking and you wake up with someone so ugly that you would rather chew your arm off than wake them up to know you're leaving. Believe me, you're not going to feel that way leaving this one! BUY THIS MOVIE!!!
0440219078|5.0|This is one of the most poignant books I've ever read, and I read it twice when I was in middle school.  This science fiction book for young readers shows the perfect world of the future, and shows the many advantages and disadvantages of both perfect and imperfect worlds.  It chronicles the experience of Jonas, who has lived happily in a perfect futurestic community, until he recieves memories from the giver.  I don't want to give away too much from the book, but basically in an imperfect world there is pain, love, and knowledge.  In a perfect world, there is no pain, no love, and no knowledge.  Jonas starts to challenge many of the qualities of the world and the plot gets pretty exciting as the story advances more and more.  At first I thought it was a little harsh, but I later realized that the message in the book not only touched the mind and heart ofthe reader, but the characters in the book as well.  Both me and my sister enjoyed it.  It's very good overview of the world and life, and it's also a very good book for young readers.
B00003CXHJ|3.0|In the commentary and supplementary materials, Writer/Director Jonathan Mostow stresses the attention to detail and accuracy of his portrayal of WW2 submarine warfare, and the bold claims he makes therefore entitle one to analyse and be critical of the result.<br />Much of the movie does indeed capture the essence of the submarine environment (the leaks in S-33 really added to the veracity), but Mostow can't resist the temptation to add typical Hollywood &quot;thriller&quot; incidents that are completely unrealistic.<br />Probably the most glaring impossibility/improbability was the undersea battle between the two U-boats firing torpedoes at each other. The chances of either U-boat's torpedoes getting anywhere near close to the other U-boat are close to zero, and I think perhaps only once in the entire war did a submarine successfully torpedo a submerged enemy submarine (firing into an unsuspecting target sub broadside-on not bow-on). Plainly also the torpedoes in this movie did not have magnetic/proximity detonators (the torpedo sliding along the side of U571!).<br />Indeed, Mostow gets the torpedo issues wrong most of the time. The movie opens with the U571 (in German hands) torpedoing a merchant ship. Total time from firing the torpedo until it explodes - oh, about five seconds! The captain had earlier said &quot;set speed for 35 knots&quot; (did the Germans also measure speed in knots?) and so this would mean that the torpedo was travelling at 60 feet every second - suggesting the merchant ship was only 300' away from the submarine!!! (A more realistic distance would be five to ten times further away and therefore a less exciting five to ten times longer delay in the movie between firing and exploding).<br />The startling inaccuracy/ineffectiveness of the German destroyer's gunnery both times that it was shooting at the U571 is also notable, particularly when contrasted against which was the amazing ability of the heros to deploy an unfamiliar submarine deck gun and fire it (did anyone see the gun being loaded?) all in a couple of seconds and hit the destroyer exactly where they wished!

B000002B4A|5.0|I received this CD as a freebie back in '95 and I still haven't gotten sick of it. I love the ethnic singing and am happy to hear such a strong and emotional expression in the voices. From track to track you feel uplifted to peaceful to blue. It reminds you to be happy with the simple things in life.<br />I am a huge Enigma fan. I loved them from the beginning, but appreciate the differences between these two bands. I like how Deep Forest is more ethnic and unlike Enigma, whose songs seem to all one in the same, there are distinct differences in each of the songs on Boheme.

0784011796|5.0|I viewed &quot;Pi&quot; about a year ago.  My little sister felt I would appreciate the film for three reasons: I have a Bachelor in Mathematics, I find the nature of numbers to be beautiful, and I have been on a low-key spiritual quest most of my life.  This film stimulated me in all three interests and many more.  It would help the viewer to have some understanding of what &quot;Pi&quot; is in mathematics and why it is an essential but enigmatic number and concept. Don't let little kids watch it - they wouldn't ponder the film but have nightmares.  &quot;Pi&quot; is a rich, deep film for those who philosophize about God, Sanity and so much more.
0684853523|5.0|The most amazing thing about Stephen King's &quot;On Writing&quot; is that nearly every page has something useful for the aspiring writer.  I don't agree that the middle third is the only section for the writer; for me, the first third gave me the best idea of the sort of childhood and life that MADE Stephen King a writer -- the first third sets up perfectly how he is who he is, and why he loves to write.  Best of all, King is able to transform that absolute love for writing to the reader of the book.  Writing IS fun, should BE fun, and for him, you can see why it is. . .      As a published writer of short fiction and poetry, I still learned more about APPROACHING the art of writing through this book than all the other books and magazines I've read on the subject combined.  While reading it, whenever I got down about the progress of my own work, a single page read from this book and I was back on track.  An amazing work on the art of writing fiction, it should be required reading for any class on creative writing.
B0000541AM|5.0|Walter Hill's vision of this fictional gangland is more interesting than any realistic street gang movie in the past twenty years.  The Gramercy Riffs want to organize New York's gangs and take over the city.  All the gangs meet, and the leader of the Riffs is shot and killed.  The Warriors are blamed and have to make it back home with every gang in the city looking for them: not to mention the police.  Is that a great set up or what?  The soundtrack is great and adds to the impending feeling of doom that looms over our unwitting protagonists.  The script and plot stick to the issue at hand and don't drift into any silly subplots.  The dialouge is simple and to the point.  It also has provided us with many great one-liners, &quot;Warriors come out to play-eh-yhea!&quot;.  The fight scenes are great.  Walter Hill has created a true cult classic that has stood the test of time.  Thank you Paramount for releasing this great film in DVD.
B00003W8NM|4.0|Fight Clubs are the refuge for middle-age men to beat each other up run by the Narrator and Tyler Durden. Taken from the book of the same name, this is perhaps slightly better than it and is full of brilliant lines and great peformances. Each repeated viewing of this film turns up new details, plus this is a good excuse to watch it as many times as you can!<br />The DVD is full of extra features which go into great detail about the creation of the film. The commentaries are the best, with not just Director's Commentary, but stars and also the writer and screenplay writer's views.<br />So how does this get just 4 stars? Mainly just little annoyances with the DVD itself and the fact that the film isn't perfect.
B00003CXFG|5.0|I had not seen this movie in the theaters so the first time I saw it was when I purchased my DVD from Amazon. I was amazed at what a good movie this was. Some reviewers compared it to a cheap version of Alien. Granted Alien is one of my favroite SCI-FI movies of all time but this movie surpassed it in some ways. From a pure SCI-FI stand point Alien was far better. But Pitch Black had far more character development and was also a psycological thriller. I expected the ending in Alien about 3/4 through the picture. But the ending of Pitch Black suprised me. I would recommend this movie for people who are not really into SCI-FI as well becuase the film is rich in character development and drama. The only thing I was disappointed with on this DVD were the additional features. The Making Of was bascially a commercial and the Rave Parties were just awful. The commentaries were decent. The strength of the movie and the awsome video transfer with the DTS 6.1 audio made me give it 5 stars.
B00004TRD8|4.0|T2 is perhaps one of the few Sequels that are as good as the original, full of great action sequences and some pretty good characterisation. The film's not brilliant, but it is a great 2 hrs, (or so), of your time.<br />The DVD is perhaps the most comprehensive edition ever, with one exception that I'm surprised no-one has mentioned; the menu system is terrible. Hidden buttons, no explanations and incorrect instructions just add to the nightmare of navigating this disc. Once you get around this extremely obscure method you can get access to a lot of good material on the making of the disc. It's just a pity that the Commentary is a collection of audio clips from the cast &amp; crew and not just one or two people doing it.<br />Still, it's worth getting and I'm glad I did.
0684853523|5.0|On Writing is a fabulous read.   Educational and an interesting story together....it is clear that King is using his own advice in the writing of this book and hoping that the reader will notice how and where he's used it....some people say that it is really in two sections but I do not agree...it is after all, &quot;a memoir&quot; on writing so of course he gives a picture of his childhood and young adulthood so that the reader can see how anyone with enough desire and talent can become a writer.  To be a truly great writer though is something mysterious and magic.  It may be apparant in our childhood if we are like Stephen, compelled to read and write from a very young age.  A vivid imagination.  The motivation to sit down and write for hours every day and enjoy it....this book which I finished tonight has inspired me to try writing.  I haven't published anything and I am a 40-ish housewife, but friends tell me that I have some writing talent.   They say they see it in my letters and emails, etc...and now after reading Stephens book it doesn't seem as far-out an idea anymore...this book is so inspirational...I underlined many things.....I just love ya Stephen!...one interesting thing I discovered from reading this book was that at the same time S.K. started drinking, I lost interest in his books.   His first few books were so good that my husband and I would literally tear the books in half so that one of us could read the first half and one the second half!   Then I quit enjoying his books and stopped reading him for about 15 or so years....I picked up Bag Of Bones one day and was hooked again...soon read Geralds Game and caught up on a couple others....Your biggest fan...HJK
0688171664|4.0|A Japanese biologist wrote about this book in a Japanese magazine as<br />follows: Many years ago when she was studying in England and going to<br />buy a motorcycle, one of her colleagues recommended her to read this<br />book, but it was not really a book on motorcycle maintenance but a<br />book that taught philosophy in a simple manner. She liked this book<br />and read it repeatedly.<br />Reading this story and finding that the<br />twenty-fifth anniversary edition of this book was published in<br />paperback, I bought a copy and began to read it by expecting to learn<br />something about philosophy or the history of philosophy. To some<br />extent, this expectation made me read the book quickly in an effort to<br />get to possible chapters where the teaching of philosophy might be<br />fully given. Even without such a motivation, however, one could read<br />this book speedily, because the story magically enchants the reader<br />and because the style of Pirsig's writing is very readable even to the<br />non-native speaker of English who, like me, has read only a small<br />number of novels in English.<br />Surely, descriptions of classical<br />philosophies and contemporary philosophical problems are given in<br />parallel with the story of motorcycle traveling, I have found that<br />this is essentially a novel, which invokes ideas about the<br />reunification of art and technology and about the quality of life. The<br />great point of the book is that it can also be enjoyed as a book<br />on philosophy, though descriptions of ancient Greek philosophies in<br />later chapters are not very understandable. In the last chapters the<br />story of a relation between a father and his son reaches a moving<br />climax.
0767805712|5.0|Gattaca is not for hard-core sci-fi fans.  There are no alien monsters, no Darth Vaders.  Instead it is a movie about us.  The plot is set in the future to provide an extrapolation of the perceived present.  The world of Gattaca is more soulless, more class polarised, less humane than our own.  It casts a harsh light on today's social mores.<br />Ethan Hawke and Jude Law are both superb in their roles.  Their characters reflect the flaws in Gattaca's (and our) society - Jude, the gilded but gelded; and Ethan, the flawed but unflinching.<br />The direction, musical score and cinematography all work to provide the brutal truth behind the polished surfaces of Gattaca.  <br />If you see Gattaca looking for Han Solo or Lt. Ripley you will be disappointed.  See it instead for a new perspective on how to live your own life.
B00004ZEQX|4.0|Considering Diamond Entertainment's reputation for low-end releases and Amazon's bargain basement price for this DVD, I was fully expecting a poor quality disc.  However, I'm pleased to report that this was actually a great buy!  The picture and sound transfer are very good, the film is in its original widescreen format and, most important of all, it's uncut!  Granted, there is a lack of extras (you get a one page bio on Lucio Fulci and that's about it), but I'm more than pleased with the film itself and that's what matters most to me.
0930289455|5.0|This graphic novel is about the Batman, a very dark hero against very evil villains, in this case the Joker.  The mood in the comic is very intense, as the rivalry of The Dark Knight and an insane killer escalates.  The growing emotional drama between these two is very evident in this story.  It also focuses in on the darker side of the human soul.  I saw a hero, who is himself plagued with personal demons, having to face a villian who became  a devil, through extreme circumstances, after his life was incredibly taken away from him.  The comic tells us the origin of the Joker and it tells us how he became this evil force.  Being set up to commit his first crime, he pays the ultimate price during his first encounter with the Batman, and as a result, he plummets into a vat of chemicals disfiguring him which causes him to lose his mind.  Becoming a crime boss himself he mercilessly kills people for his own personal entertainment, like a private sick joke.  He kidnaps Commissioner Gordon and his daughter after permanently crippling her with a gun shot to her spine.  Batman goes in after them in the Joker's lair and attempts to rescue them.  For a comic book, it is quite suprising how involved the story can get, therefore I reccomend this book to any mature person who likes good literature.
B0000021S9|3.0|I found this album to be a disappointment.  The musicianship of the band seems inferior to the Carnegie Hall collection, which to this day, remains one of the most exciting and fresh live albums available.  <br />Danny Seraphine's drumming, in particular, lacks the innovation and provocativeness that was part of the magic of the 'Carnegie' live sound.  He's still a great drummer, but he's playing by rote on this one.  The horns are wandering and plainly bored of playing the same songs one-more-time. You can really hear it on &quot;Does Anybody Really Know what time It Is?&quot;.  Robert Lamn's piano playing is simililarly dulled by time.  The band as a whole sounds sloppy and bored. One exception is '25 or 6 to 4', which manages to not sound like a dinosaur tripping on itself, as it does on 'Carnegie'.<br />The sound quality of this album is also inferior to 'Carnegie'.  It's bottom heavy and unbalanced.  At times parts of the brass section seem to be climbing in your ear, while the other half seems to be a mile away.  Too much brass and bass.  Not enough piano or guitar.<br />Singing in Japanese?  Is it worth twenty bucks just to hear that?  Doubt it.<br />The only redeeming factor and the best reason to buy this CD is to catch the live versions of the 'Chicago V' tracks.  'V' was a terrific album, recovering totally from the weak indulgences of 'III', and to hear these particular tracks live, even with all the aforementioned flaws of the album as a whole, makes this a worthwhile buy.<br />-pa
0399146253|1.0|I have read all of Patrica Cornwell's &quot;Scarpetta escapades&quot; and loved most of them. However, quite frankly this is the worst yet. I have felt since &quot;Point of Origin&quot; that the ending's seem rushed and not of the high standards set in Patrica Cornwell's  previous books, &quot;Black Notice&quot; confirmed this to me and &quot;The Last Precinct&quot; just about takes the biscuit.<br />Truly awful, Ms Cornwell (if you ever read this) If you are bored with Scarpetta, then end it..! but do somthing for your reputation sake.

6304806434|4.0|Con Air is the reason they make big screen TVs.  If you have or can find someone who has a projector, even better.  The action in this flick is top-notch.  Not only that, but it keeps giving you more... there's about 3 places it could stop before it does, but in the end you don't mind the extra time because it just means more action.  Cage is excellent as the one who &quot;couldn't leave a fallen man behind&quot;.<br />The only point I take off is for Cage's annoying attempt at a southern accent.  It's only really apparent at the beginning, though, you get used to it as the movie goes on.
B00003CXE6|5.0|This movie is nothing short of magnificent.  It captures both 'the glory that was Rome' as well as the relationship between a fighting commander and his troops, both used to hardship and victory, and attempting to finish the job and go home.<br />This is also undoubtedly the best movie I have ever seen.  It is reminiscent of the spectacles of the late 50s and early 60s, such as Ben Hur, El Cid, and 55 Days at Peking, but much more intense and certainly more realistic.<br />The characters are greater than life, such as Maximus (Russell Crowe), the Roman general who was like a son to the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (masterfully played by veteran Irish actor Richard Harris, whose facial expressions tell more than his diaglogue), and who was betrayed by Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), Marcus' feckless son, who 'was not a moral man.'<br />Director Ridley Scott has captured many things in this film: the timeless relationship between veteran soldiers and their commanders, Rome in its last spurt of greatness, evil and corruption of the Roman upper classes, the seeming hopelessness of good being overcome by evil, innocence of the young, and the recurring theme that evil will fluorish if good men do nothing.<br />Lavishly filmed, and with better special effects than either Titanic or last year's Star Wars Episode One, it shows the Rome that may have been, with all the dirt, grit, and corruption that never showed up in the other epic films about Rome and its Empire.<br />Music is also superb, and undoubtedly brings out the violent action of the film, from rousing fighting in the Coliseum to savage combat on the Danube frontier between the indomitable Legions and the German barbarians.<br />Lastly, this was Oliver Reed's last film.  Remembered for his portrayal of the one of the Three Musketeers in the mid-70s and in the film Oliver, he is superb here, dying of a heart attack while the movie was being filmed.  The final product is a tribute both to him and his ability in front of the camera.<br />This is a film for the ages.  It covers valor, cowardice, loyalty, love, hate, betrayal, and brings it in a story that is enthralling, exciting, and relevant to modern times.  The Director and cast, and the rest that contributed are to be congratulated.  If Scott, Crowe, the movie itself, cinematography and music are not awarded with Oscars by the Academy this year, it will be a great injustice.  I saw it five times on the big screen and enjoyed it every time.  Quite simply, it is superb.the camera.<br />This is a film for the ages.

B00004XOWN|5.0|Well, LB has done it again.  This is truly an awesome CD.  The CD consists of some brand new loud songs (My Generation, Hot Dog, etc...), as well as one of their previous songs (Take a Look Around {M:I2 Soundtrack}).  I don't really have much access to the CD (I live in China, but am not Chinese), but I have heard many of the new songs, and I like them.  This is a must-buy.
0446677450|5.0|I used to be what the book calls a &quot;95 percenter&quot; -- that is, I used to believe that a person, in order to be successful, you had to go to school, get a degree, get a good paying job and then retire with whatever you could scrounge and save. This is something that has been passed on from generation to generation in my family. It is also something that I've been uncomfortable with. Reading this book opened my eyes and helped me realize that there is another way to live. My children will know me as a &quot;Rich Dad&quot;.
0804106304|5.0|The Joy Luck Club is one of my favorite books. They are like little stories but they connect to each other. <br />There is the Jong family, the Woo family, the Hsu family and the St. Clair family. Each family is represented by the mother and the daughter because each member has their own story to tell. It's like the past and present in each story; the mother represents the past and the daughter represents the present. Even though the time is different with the mother and daughter, their stories are similar. In each chapter of the story, the mother and daughter of each family discovers more about themselves and about their daughters. <br />This book is unbelievable, because each time I read it there seems to be more than it is. I think this is a live maze because you think you have solved it but you really don't. What this book has that most books don't is the on going mystery. The other books I read, their ending is wrapped up in a nice little package but this book has more to it. I wondered what would happen afterwards but it's really hard because these characters are like real life. <br />I think this book is really fabulous and Amy Tan is a really great writer because of her writing and skills. Amy Tan is able to enter in some psychological complex and a little bit of everything else into her writing and that is really great. I love this book. I so recommend this book to all readers!!
0553106635|5.0|...but it will be absolute torture waiting for book four.<br />This book, amazingly, was actually _better_ than the preceding two.  Mr. Martin is without a doubt the most enrapturing fantasy writer I've ever had the privilege to read.
0345409671|5.0|Reviewers who were hoping for more atmospheric &quot;Interview&quot; musings (first book in series) or revisting rockin' &quot;Lestat&quot; (book two) were disappointed. However, I absolutely loved this book: It's Anne Rice's RANT against God! The vampire part is almost not important. I highly suggest you read this book back-to-back with Richard Matheson's &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; (very different from the film)... These two books will give you a glimpse into how different the theology is of kids raised Catholic and those raised Protestant, but even more interesting, they both explore the afterlife in FASCINATING depth.
B00000J7JO|5.0|I am not much of a rock fan, but this is definetly a worthy album!  &quot;Porcelin&quot; is just great, and &quot;Road Trippin&quot; is just as good!
B000001FA4|3.0|&quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; is a rare misfire in the U2 catalog, despite the fact that it contains two of their all time best songs in &quot;Pride (in the Name of Love)&quot; and &quot;Bad,&quot; the latter of which was given an amazing live treatment at 1985's Live Aid concert.  The rest of the album is murky and uncertain, even as some good songs such as &quot;Wire&quot; and &quot;A Sort of Homecoming&quot; push through to the fore.  The band seemed so intent on making a grand statement (hence the all the Martin Luther King references) that they seemed to forget that rock'n'roll is supposed to be fun.<br />Overall, committed fans will probably love this album, but casual fans are advised to stick with their greatest hits album (which contains &quot;Pride&quot; and &quot;Bad&quot;) instead.
B00004XQP4|4.0|A great cd from from the leaders of the pop/punk pack.All song are great and provide a variety of sounds.Another one of Armstrong and company's masterpiece's.But, if you don't have there first album, dookie, i suggest you check it out too.
B000001DTM|5.0|The boys from Dublin released only three studio albums during the 1990s, and of the three &quot;Ach-Tung Baby&quot; easilly gets the nod as the best.  Though not quite up to the standards of their masterpiece album &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, it still features some of the band's most amazing performances.  &quot;Mysterious Ways,&quot; which is surprisingly dancable, is one of the band's best singles.  &quot;Whose Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses?&quot; and &quot;So Cruel&quot; and sonically amazing a lyrically soulful.  &quot;Zoo Station&quot; and &quot;The Fly&quot; show the beginnings of the extensive experimentation that the band would do throught the 90s.  And while Bono may overreach lyrically on &quot;Trying to Throw Your Arms Around the World&quot; with his &quot;fish on a bicycle&quot; line, for the most part his words are as good as the music.<br />Overall, if you're going to buy one U2 album from the twentieth century's last decade, you should make it this one.
0141301155|5.0|This work was designed to instill proper moral behavor in children, something certainly needed in today's world. Dahl clearly drew on the classics to inspire and inform these works, relying upon their tried and true methods of wonder, curiosity, charisma, (and more than a little fear,) to elicit the proper resonse.  He just changed things a little to make the tale relevant to children... I think that &quot;Charlie&quot;will be added to that list of nearly sacred tales, for the wonder of it's story, and the absolute mastery in it's telling, and finally, the simple message. BE GOOD. <br />In &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,&quot; The characters are random souls, thrust together and cast through a purgatory of sorts, where each child, (representing the deadly sins) is punished according to nature, estabishing and enforcing a strong moral code in the reader.  They rise through the various stages devised by the master of the place, until they arrive at a state of final judgement, where the least and best of them, confesses his sins and his faults, and is found worthy and inherits the kingdom of heaven. (The chocolate factory, and all its wonders.)  This is basic Dante, retold in the vein of Blake, with the social satire and subtle wit of Swift. <br />The intent of the work is the same as the intent of its source material. A vanitas motif, explaining our impurities, our sins, finding each of us wanting, instructing us in the proper moral path by illustrating the folly of vice, and the imperfect nature of man.  What better message to teach to a child?  A wonderful work that I read often (at least once a year) and I never fail to find something incredible, something new.
B000001FS3|5.0|&quot;The Joshua Tree,&quot; much like Bruce Springsteen's &quot;Born in the U.S.A.,&quot; was unavoidable for any rock fan in the 1980s.  Like The Boss, U2 released an album that was as critically acclaimed as it was mega popular.  The album proved its staying power as hit single after hit single hit the airwaves.  The first three songs, &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name,&quot; &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot; and &quot;With or Without You,&quot; were all massive hits and absolute musical gems to boot.  From there, &quot;Bullet in Blue Sky&quot; may be a bit murky, but by the time you get to side two there's the great &quot;Red Hill Mining Town,&quot; &quot;In God's Country,&quot; &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; and the sorrowful &quot;Mothers of the Disappeared.&quot;<br />Overall, &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; is an absolute masterpiece that U2 has been unable, despite releasing some very good records, to top since its release.
B00003CXDG|1.0|The opening was beyond belief!  The photography was spectacular and the stunts so unbelievable as to be, well, impossible.  Of course, if you're a die-hard Cruise fan, &quot;acting&quot; or plausability are not material.  The first hour was better than sleeping pills.  The last parts had some pretty good (visually) scenes although still only designed as a tribute to the demigod Cruise.  Everything else was just dumb.  Glad I only rented this one and with a coupon... better yet.
B000001FRY|4.0|Hard to believe that the boys from Dublin have been cranking out consistently great music for twenty years now.  They may have evolved from teenage wunderkinds to polished professionals, but their commitment has remained the same.  Though it failed to make much impact in the U.S. upon its initial release, &quot;Boy&quot; remains one of the band's best albums for its superior songwriting and undeniable energy.  Had The Clash spent more of their youth listening to Bruce Springsteen, they might have sounded like U2.  The best cuts here are the opening single &quot;I Will Follow,&quot; the double song suite &quot;An Cat Dubh/Into the Heart,&quot; and the rocking &quot;Out of Control&quot; and &quot;A Day Without Me.&quot;  All these cuts are delivered with an intensity the band would never again even try to achieve and with a minimum of political posturing.<br />Overall, a strong debut from on the best rock bands of the last twenty years.
B000005RFQ|4.0|Years ago I bought this Sabbath album specifically because  Ian Gillian was working with Tony Iommi.  BUT as someone else said, this CD is not a cross between Deep Purple and Black Sabbath.  It is pure Sabbath, hard hitting and unforgettable.   It has been years since I lost my original 1983 cassette tape and even longer since I listened to it.  Now I am a lot older and the songs always stuck with me so I am finally caving and buying the CD.   I think I sing 'Disturbing the Priest' at least once a day, whenever I am doing something that I am not supposed to do. If you liked 'Heaven and Hell' you are ready to move on to this album, which is worth it just for 'Trashed' alone.  Truly the last Black Sabbath album-- not a bad addition to your collection.
B000002C1V|5.0|When I first bought this album about 10 years ago, I immediately regretted it.  I just hadn't known how much Pink Floyd could vary in musical approach. Plus it is so UN-macho. My interests at the time were strictly heavy groups like Metallica and Led Zeppelin.  I had wanted to explore into unfamiliar groups, but this seemed radically unusual.  But it also peaked my curiosity, so I listened to it more and more.  Before long, I found that it was communicating emotions in a way that 99% of music never does.  A thread of genius works throughout, and completely original in craft.  Yes, I think it has a depressing tone, and I think that is why it is unpopular among PF fans; however plummeting to the bottom and identifying with one's thoughts can be cathartic.  If you enjoy exploring various musical styles, and have an open mind, then I invite you to order this CD.  When you get it, go to your stereo, insert it, and turn out the lights, then carefully walk over and take a seat. From the exploding mortar shell to sitting at the bar, you'll feel like you're there as he sings.
0783241542|3.0|This movie was Ok, and it had some really funny scenes, but I can't help but feel that it's been highly over-rated. In my opinion, the movie just had too much lag. It really seemed long and drawn out, and had a relatively weak ending.    I have noticed that (for whatever reasons) alot of people are comparing this movie with &quot;There's Something About Mary.&quot; Well, for those of you who have seen &quot;Mary,&quot; and have not seen American Pie, I can tell you that there's no comparison, &quot;Mary&quot; is far, far superior.  Still, I would say American Pie is at least worth renting once. It DOES have some totally hilarious moments, just lots of &quot;filler&quot; in between.
B000002ACR|5.0|The circumstances involving the recording of the Byrds' fourth album, YOUNGER THAN YESTERDAY, are as classic as the albums itself.  Roger McGuinn and David Crosby are battling over the artist direction that the band will take, Chris Hillman has suddenly become a prolific songwriter, and Michael Clarke isn't particularly interested in the band or the music.  These circumstances would tear the band apart the next year, but on YOUNGER THAN YESTERDAY, the band is unified, producing some of the best music of their careers.  &quot;So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star&quot; may have been written as commentary on the Monkees, but it's a remarkable song.  The lyrics and melody are perfectly matched with the brass and sound effects contributing nicely.  &quot;Have You Seen Her Face&quot; is one of the album's best songs, with it's breath-taking guitar work and stunning lyricism.  The second example of McGuinn's space rock and alien ambitions is &quot;C.T.A.-102&quot;, completed with a wonderful melody, the sounds of an oscillator, and simulated alien voices.  &quot;Renaissance Fair&quot; is one of the greatest Byrds tracks, and one of Crosby's most perfect songs.  The lyrical imagery is incredible and the melody is equally impressive.  Hillman's first song &quot;Time Between&quot; is equally remarkable to the other songs on this album.  The difficult relationship in the lyrics is well expressed with the country feel in the melody.  &quot;Everybody's Been Burned&quot; is extraordinary, one of the most haunting ballad's recorded in the 1960s.  &quot;Thoughts And Words&quot; is a fabulous compostition with the unusual backwards sounds, and the melody and lyrics as striking as on &quot;Have You Seen Her Face&quot;.  Crosby's &quot;Mind Gardens&quot; is often dismissed as excessive, and while it isn't Top 40 radio, it's a brillant compostion in an experimental era.  There aren't many rock musicians that bring references to HAMLET onto a Top 40 album by a prestigous rock band.  &quot;My Back Pages&quot; is ranks second on my list of my favorite Byrds Bob Dylan covers (&quot;This Wheel's On Fire&quot; from DR. BYRDS AND MR. HYDE is first).  &quot;My Back Pages&quot; is an impeccable performance and proof about the Byrds abilities as Dylan interpreters.  One word describes it perfectly, classic.  &quot;The Girl With No Name&quot; is Hillman's fifth composing credit on the album.  The extraordinary lyricism is matched well with the country melody.  I don't understand the reason using the third version of &quot;Why&quot;, but I don't oppose it.  It can be reasoned as the continuation of the Byrds comic album endings.  Crosby's &quot;It Happens Each Day&quot;, the first bonus track, is one of his finest Byrd compositions.  It'd be better to include the original, but this version paints an accurate picture of a marvelous song.  &quot;Don't Make Waves&quot; is an intense quick number, not spectacular but far from terrible.  The alternate versions of &quot;My Back Pages&quot; and &quot;Mind Games&quot; are valuable additions.  While &quot;Lady Friend&quot; and &quot;Old John Robertson&quot; might have been better placed on THE NOTORIOUS BYRDS BROTHERS, they end YOUNGER THAN YESTERDAY sensationally.  &quot;Lady Friend&quot; is one of the best rock singles from 1967.  &quot;Old John Robertson&quot; is a throughly enjoyable number&quot;.  The psychedilic music at the end of &quot;Old John Robertson&quot; is interesting, but not exactly neccessary.  YOUNGER THAN YESTERDAY is one of the best Byrds albums, the variety is present, the experimentation is incredible, and the consistency is remarkable.  I place YOUNGER THAN YESTERDAY as one of my favorite Byrds albums, its an instantly likeable collection of incredibly perfect music and proof that the Byrds are one of the best bands in music history.
B000000W6F|3.0|I'd like to start off by saying that I am an absolutely huge Smashing Pumpkins fan, and that others who share this feeling will likely find this review sacreligious. <br />I think that about 80% of the music on this album is completely brilliant and fantastic to listen to. I suppose this is partially due the dynamics of the album (loud/soft, complicated/simplistic). <br />But, the other 20% makes me ask myself: Why did they put THAT on their debut album? Some of the stuff on Gish weren't my bag at all. One of these songs was Window Paine. It's incredibly longwinded and rather boring in my opinion. In fact, I have an analogy for this song. Say you're looking at a bright white paper. At first, the paper looks nice and clean and swell, but the longer you look at the paper, the more gray and annoying it is. <br />I'm not saying this is a crappy album or anything like that. I'm just trying to warn you everything on this album may not be is as terrific as everybody says. Nonetheless, recall the 80% that rocks the free world. If Smashing Pumpkins excluded the 20% I didn't like, I would be telling you that Gish is a work of sheer genius. <br />I hope I didn't confuse you or make you hate me. Good luck buying stuff.
6305327084|3.0|This is a good film...not a great one, and certainly not as great as some reviews here would have you believe, mostly due to some of the worst screenwriting I have been forced to hear and witness in a long time.  A previous reviewer was very correct in singling out the &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; singing scene, for one; it stands out as one of the most embarrassing-to-watch scenes of any movie I've seen in many years.  Others that are just jaw-dropping in their brainlessness include the &quot;Bottled Promise&quot; speech by Michael Rapaport's character and a large proportion of Natalie Portman's lines (&quot;colored girls go doot-da-doot&quot;, &quot;honey-limbed lovely&quot;...agh!  shoot me now!).  <br />As for Natalie herself, I'm one of her biggest fans, but I don't think this is one of her better showings; that too is severely overrated in the reviews here.  In her defense, I think it was because she was given nothing to work with; she really has the worst lines generally of any character in the movie.  To her credit, though, she still manages to use her innate charm to salvage the character and obviously, make it a favorite of many.  Still, if you want to see her at her most brilliant, check out &quot;Leon - The Professional&quot;.<br />All this said, it's not a bad film overall...still worth 3 stars.  What makes it worthwhile, more than anything else (to me at least), is its star power and chemistry.  Timothy Hutton, Mira Sorvino, and Matt Dillon are especially wonderful, and I wish they would be given more Hollywood visibility in general (together would be even better, judging by their chemistry here).  The story itself is ok, but frankly the chick-flick-for-guys philosophy misses more often than it hits here.  <br />And for those that care about DVD technicals, the quality of the voice tracks is much poorer than most DVD's I've seen, with a lot of them being (frustratingly) not loud enough.

0399146253|2.0|Having thouroughly enjoyed Cornwell's previous works (at least the Scarpetta series), I was thrilled to get my hands on &quot;Precinct&quot;.  It really wasn't worth the wait. I kept waiting for some pace to develop, and for Scarpetta to emerge from the self-pity malaise.  It never happened.  The conspiracy was far fetched and ill developed, and the insightful forensics Cornwell's fans have come to expect were nearly non-existant.  I turned the last page feeling like Grisham fans have after his last four or five...suckered
B00004Y7SF|5.0|Christina's Christmas album gives you some R&amp;B, Soul, and Pop. It ranges from upbeat songs to slow ones.Best song she sings on this album is Oh Holy Night. Her voice really shines through in this CD. All you can do is go &quot;wow&quot; she can really sing!This CD is a must have for the seasons.
0553106635|3.0|How can such a talented writer make an epic tale so painful to read?  <br />After completing book three I once again am frustrated that there has been little movement to the grand battle that has been forshadowed for so long.  Aside from killing off some characters that were getting hard to keep track of anyway (thank you George for the 45 page appendix of names and houses -- I still didn't keep everyone straight) there has been little progression towards a closure in the plotline.  After 2000 pages I'm starting to wonder if there ever will be.<br />George R. Martin is as I said, a very talented writer.  He managed to keep me gripped and on the edge of my seat throughout most of his book.  Unfortunately, now that I've finished, I'm still on the edge of my seat and I'm starting to understand that the hero's in this series are destined for a never ending series of torments and defeats.  <br />&quot;A song of Ice and Fire&quot; has the potential to be a great fantasy epic.  I'm sorry to say that next time I'm going to wait for the paperback.  I'm just too tired of waiting for the hero's I've invested so much time in to accomplish something besides surviving through misery and pain.  If the next book is the same I might just give up on the series entirely.
B00004TL21|5.0|I've liked the Deftones for a long time. But this isn't traditional Deftones. Gone are the screaming and anger, replaced by a more mellow Chino? Those who think the band &quot;sold out&quot; with this album obviously haven't listened to Elite, likely one of the heaviest songs they've ever written. And the rest of the album is genious. A couple of friends have called it &quot;The Radiohead of Deftones&quot; and I couldn't agree more. They've really gone out on a limb and experimented with new ideas, and the best part is that most of them work. Highlights of the album include the mellow Digital Bath, the percussive RX Queen, the moderatly disturbing Knife Prty, and of course the amazing first single Change (In The House Of Flies). Also interesting is Maynard (vocalist for Tool) and his addition to the song Passenger.
B00003CXHJ|3.0|I World War II fictional movie in the old Hollywood war film tradition.  Sound and video quality (DVD) are first-rate.  <br />It may have the distinction of the worst music score created for such a film.  The composer (I did not recognize his name) was trying to write like Bill Conti and failed.  <br />As everyone has indicated, Das Boot is far better artistically, but this film should be appreciated by war movie fans.
B00004T8RK|3.0|Sorry to say, but this is a mediocre album released by a mediocre band. Sure, they were once the most amazing band out there, and their debut Ten is a staple in any rock or alternative fan's CD collection, but they just can't seem to produce that quality of music anymore. As with their last few albums, singer Eddie Vedder sounds half asleep as he plods through the un-energetic songs. I compare the entire album to their first single from it, Nothing As It Seems. There are points in the song where the energy starts to climb, and you just wait for the band to start rocking out, but it doesn't happen and the song ends at the same un-energetic tempo that it started with. The saving grace of the album is that it doesn't suck. The songs, while not spectacular, are still quite listenable, a couple of highlights being the ballad-y Light Years and Thin Air. But if you're expecting another Ten, or even a Vs. or Vitalogy, you're better off buying a CD from one of the many Pearl Jam rip-off bands out there than from the actual band.
B00004X01U|3.0|When I first listened to this cd, I immediately hated the cd except for Music and Runaway Lover but I wasn't willing to give up on this cd yet. I continued to listen to it until I actually started liking tracks like Instant Impressive and Nobody's Perfect. I knew that this cd wasn't going to be ROL part two however this cd fell short of my expectations. The main problem I have with this cd is that this cd is bogged down my too many slow songs. The other problem is that Mirwais. He and Madonna are like apples and bananas, or oil and water. They didn't make a good combination.
0375420525|5.0|Mark Z. is a master of language. This is the type of book that you cannot ignore. He made the story within a story interesting and accomplished it well. This novel is not like other novels for this one reason- it isn't all layed out for you. You have to do more than simply read, it recquires your thoughtsand feelings and soon, like the characters within it, you will be trapped in the 5and 1/2 minute hallway. buy it, you will enjoy it.
014028009X|3.0|What? Huh? Tell me this doesn't speak of how women are today? If so, I'm in a sad state. If not, yippee. The book wasn't incredibly horrible, just not incredibly great like I was lead to believe through editorial and personal reviews . It was a quick read, although not earth-shattering in content and rather just blah. Also, it could be viewed as a little demeaning....
B00002MZ2C|2.0|This is by far my least favourite Rage Against The Machine album. The self-title one was really alive and full of energy. Evil Empire doesn't appear as good at first, although if you give it a chance it is as good. This, on the other hand, is of a much lower quality. There are some great riffs, the best including Maria, Born Of A Broken Man and Testify. Geurrilla Radio, Sleep Now in the Fire and Born As Ghosts are also pretty cool. The fact still remains however that they are going to need to write an album that is up to the standard of the other two if thier talent is going to be continued to be recognised. The only really good thing that I have to say about this album is that it does show progression, which is always good. However, if you are new to Rage then get the first album (called Rage Against the Machine) and then Evil Empire. Don't bother shelling out money on this one.
B0000541AM|4.0|I remember watching this movie over and over again when I was a kid.  I even have the laserdisc.  Now I'm glad it's finally coming out on DVD!<br />&quot;The Warriors&quot; is a story about the street gang subculture in New York, circa the early 1980's.  The point of focus is a street gang called &quot;The Warriors&quot;, who were unfairly blamed for a rival gang member's death and who must fight their way back home amidst a &quot;jungle&quot; of gangs out to get them (e.g. the bat-wielding &quot;Baseball Furies&quot;) Many gang members, fratmen and other tough guy &quot;wannabes&quot; will find something in this film they can relate to: from the feeling of loyalty, of being social outcasts, bravery and the like.  Particularly powerful non-fight scene: when the Warriors board a train, encounter a group of obviously high society teenagers out having a good time.  The exchange of looks, body movements and the like, until the time the &quot;socs&quot; step out, conveys a lot.  <br />Based on the novel by Sol Yurick, the film features what'r probably the best performance of Michael Beck.  Why only 4 stars?  Well, for a film of this age, I would have expected more extra features, i.e. interviews with cast perhaps.  Still, this is an excellent collectible particularly for the film's cult following.  Now I wish they also come out with &quot;The Wanderers&quot;, another cult fave of mine!
0553573403|1.0|I don't know, honestly, what anyone sees in this book. It is substandard fiction and grossly boring: nothing happens in the first 70 pages. If the author does not bother to structure the plot to make something, anything, happen in the first 70 pages, he deserves to suffer in whatever literary hell there is.<br />The prologue is good, and it made me think that I was about to  get swept away into an exciting, richly immagined story. WRONG! The next 60 pages are just boring. The world describes is hardly richly immagined and the language is hard to fall in love with. The characters are just run of the mill genre cutouts. I hate being cheated. This book is simply lame.
B000000WCX|3.0|Earthling is a curious affair. The potential for it to be a great and a very silly record are evident - in equal parts - from the cover, which on the front has the dame defiantly turning his back to audience (something in that maybe? - sadly, no), donning a Ziggy-era union jack-et, and on the back has some Bowie's own, extraordinarily duff Kirlian photography. Oh-oh. This one could go either way...<br />And go either way is exactly what it does. The record itself is a curate's egg. On one hand, the material is a definite step along the long road back to form that Bowie has been travelling ever since Never Let Me Down. On the other, its presentation is so liberally sprayed with misjudgements of the sort that are now part of Bowie territory, that Earthling is the least listenable album he's ever released.<br />Deep, deep down, the songs are surprisingly strong, but you have to burrow a long way through a mire of dreadfully modish arrangement to realise that. Just what Bowie thought he was doing attempting a drum 'n' bass record (remember them? Fashionable in the UK for about six months in 1998) is anyone's guess, but the upshot is half a record of tunes accompanied by a drum machine set to frantic sewing machine mode and sampled squeaks, sequences and squeals of no obvious point. Complete folly. Fiftysomething Bowie himself could never appeal to the frightfully young and hip Drum `N' Bass crowd, so trying to make a record to appeal to them was a little like Cliff Richard trying to write techno (which, he should be noted, he did do).<br />Personnel is, as usual, hit-and-miss: regrettably, regular stooge Reeves Gabrels and his trademark (but to my ears meritless) guitar playing is represented in abundance, but there are some delightful twinkles on the Joanna from Mike Garson which provide occasional cheer. But more than anything else, they make you wish (not for the first time) a new Bowie album had more acoustic instruments, more Mike Garson, and less of the middle-age denial and silly computer equipment. Fortunately, he did get this right on the next album, Hours. But it doesn't make this one any easier to stomach.ge denial and silly computer equipment. Fortunately, he did get this right on the next album, Hours. But it doesn't make this one any easier to stomach.
0553108034|2.0|After reading A Game of Thrones, I rushed to the library and found it's sequel, A Clash of Kings.  I was intensely excited to see what happened to the compelling characters I had been introduced to in the first book of the series.    After reading the 728 pages of A Clash of Kings, I still don't know what happens to the characters.    Author George R.R. Martin follows the stories of 9 different characters - giving them obstacle after obstacle to overcome as they each pursue their goals, without letting them get even a step nearer to accomplishing those goals through the entire course of the book.  I found the book very intriguing on the sentence, or even paragraph level - Martin weaves a vivid world with a great deal of drama, however I found the book to be completely without a plot.  A Clash of Kings seemed to be a prolouge for whatever comes next, because a great deal of setting up for its sequel occurred without managing to push more than two or three of his character plots toward a resolution (and neither of those two or three plots furthered the main story).    I agree with those reviews that referred to this book as more of a history than a fantasy.  However, I would point out that in it's 14 chapters and 1000 pages, my history book manages to cover more than 300 years.  Martin, in his numerous (I didn't want to count) chapters and 728 pages, manages to cover perhaps a few weeks, tops, and to leave us completely in the dark as to whether this history will take us to any sort of finalee.  Personally, I would be perfectly happy to learn that the next book ends with the death-loving Others of the North coming down and wiping out the entire population of characters we've met - at least they'd achieve some sort of resolution then.  And Martin, with his skill in descriptive drama, could probably manage to make the character's deaths intensely interesting.    My frustration after spending hours of valuable time reading a book that got nowhere was not compensated by Martin's in depth exploration of his characters.  I will not be finishing the series, A Song of Fire and Ice.
0553106635|5.0|I was entranced by the first one. So gripped by the second one, I thought I would go crazy waiting for the third. And the third did not disappoint me. The books in Martin's epic get longer and better. Your breath is literally taken away many times, and it's torture waiting for the conclusions of the parts you were interested in when he wisks you away from a certain character's plight.<br />The only problem I have with the novels as a whole is - there's going to be too many! It'll be way too many years until we reach the conclusion .. I don't think I can stand it!<br />A minor difficulty is, I mentioned before, it's maddening to be taken away from an interesting storyline for sometimes far too long. However, I could never dare to criticize any of these books for they have brought me way too much enjoyment.
6305922756|4.0|I always compared Spinal Tap to a fine wine....the longer you let it age, the better it will taste.  Watching this DVD proves my rather silly comparison.  This film is so funny, and with the addition of over an hour of footage, this Spinal Tap DVD provides an overwhelming amount of laughter.  I find this film funnier now then when I first saw it over 10 years ago.  Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner aka &quot;Meathead&quot;) is back with his rockumentary classic in the digital medium.  The graphic design on the package and disc itself is simple.....it's black.  I'm sure the members of Spinal Tap approved this color since you can't get any more black then this.  The inner pamphlet contains updates on the members of Spinal Tap, including a &quot;Drummer Necrology&quot; of all the drummers that died throughout the years.  A funny little read, but I always seem to want more from an inner pamphlet!  I popped in the DVD and immediately started to laugh.  As the main menu started to load, the band started talking about the menu.  You really have to listen to it to understand, but if you are slow at deciding what you are going to choose, the band members have plenty to say to ammuse you while you decide.  Anyway, the choices you have are &quot;Scene Selections&quot;, which has a very impressive graphical design.  Scenes are numbered and each one has a picture and description.  You have a choice of French or Spanish subtitles while listening to the band chatter brainlessly about what a subtitle is!  Your final choice from the main menu is &quot;Special Features.&quot;  You can watch the film with audio commentary by the band which is really funny because the bands IQ seems to have decreased throughout the years!  You also have a recent interview with Marty DiBergi, and you can watch over 1 hour of rare outtakes which are hysterical!  You can click &quot;Vintage Material&quot; and watch the 'Flower People' press conference and the 'Joe Franklin Show' with the band.  You will find yourself laughing again and again!  You have the choice of watching 4 music videos including &quot;Gimme Some Money&quot;, &quot;Flower People&quot;, &quot;Hell Hole&quot;, and &quot;Big Bottom&quot;.  You have a button titled &quot;Promotional Materials&quot; where you can watch the theatrical trailer, 3 TV spots and a few other funny trailers and commercials.  The final button titled &quot;Commercials&quot; has all 3 &quot;Rock &amp; Rolls&quot; spots....all silly, all funny.  So I started to watch the film and a smile came to my face as Marty DiBergi introduces us to his film.  The new digital transfer is fairly clean.  Dirt and grain is noticeable sometimes during the film, but for this feature you really can't complain.  The picture is sharp and surpasses any previous release.  The colors, especially during the concert footage are also a noticeable improvement over any previous release.  This DVD transfer is the best version of Spinal Tap you will find.  The picture is far from poor and will be pleasing to most viewers.  There is no choice of audio formats on this DVD, but the sound was fairly clean.  It sounds great on 2 speaker set-ups and of course sounds better on surround sound set-ups.  The production track is dated, but overall pleasing for this type of film.  The dated production track will not at all affect the overall experience of the film.  It still sounded acceptably clean.  The music track sounds like it has been improved, sounding much cleaner then the production track, and opening up in ambiance and atmosphere a great deal during concert scenes.  In conclusion, if you are a fan of this film, the music, the craziness and silliness, then this release of &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot; is a MUST HAVE DVD.  The menu design and navigation are excellent, and the technical aspects of the disc are quite pleasing.  &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot; is a very funny and entertaining film.  Turn your receiver up to 11 and enjoy this DVD!
078061755X|2.0|Shine is an good movie in some sense with obviously some touching moments. But the biggest problem is the potrayal of the pianist is not true. So even though the movie based on real life character but for most part especially the pianist talent is overrated or exagerated in the movie. I've seen the way he's playing in real life concert and it's so dissapointing. It's like watching a freak show. You expected a great pianist. But you saw an average talented pianist who happened to have some pshycological problem because of his childhood experiences. That makes me dissapointed with the movie.
B000002OR4|5.0|I go to an arts school and thus we have our visual and musical section. Two days before rememberence day, we had a special day related to rememberence day where the strings (violins, cellos, bases) played in our hall for most of the day. When I heard the theme of Schindler's list playing, a tear rolled down my eye. For the rest of the day, I could not walk down the hall without crying. As weird as this might seem but that is just how it was. Finally, I asked one of the bass players to tell me the title (I did not know it at that time.) when he told me what it was, I was even more shocked since I had watched the movie only a year ago and just like the theme song, it too touched me very deeply. Now I am one of the many proud owners of this CD. THIS IS A MUST HAVE EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT INTO CLASSICAL TYPE MUSIC. THE SONGS IN THIS CD SPEAKS TO YOUR SOUL. ALL OF THE TRACKS ARE EXCELLENT, THE MORE YOU LISTEN TO IT, THE MORE YOU WILL APPRECIATE IT.

B00004Z459|5.0|Upon perchasing this CD, i had no idea what i was getting into.  Yet, as it all turns out, my puchase was a wise one.  Linkin Park over whelmed me with the combonation of rock with a tint of hip-hop.  Though many people, that i have descovered, have never heard of them, it is a must that you get this CD!  Everything comes together to give this band the success that will give them stardom.
0060900075|5.0|In the path to spiritual enlightenment, few works become more neccessary a read than those of Aldous Huxley.  His views and ideas are timeless, as much as they are creative.. The doors he opens, or perhaps merely unlocks and leaves us to open, left me in awe of the possibilities he presented to me.  These two books allow those who are prepared, to explore the most mysterious and least traveled territory known to us all; the human mind.
0553106635|5.0|When I got this third volume, I was a bit dubious as the story was 924 pages long.  While I thought the first two books were fantastic, I was concerned that Mr. Martin might pull a Robert Jordan and lose track of his plot and allow his characters to meld into one indistinct quagmire or monotony.  I should have known better.  Despite its size, Storm of Swords is tightly written, logical, and despite the many points of view that move the plot, not at all confusing.  There are loads of surprises contained within these pages.  It was great getting to read chapters from Jaime's point of view.  His meeting with Tyrion toward the end of the story broke my heart.  And the epilogue... Wow.  It's going to be a long wait until 2002.
0449911357|5.0|Although I saw the movie based on this book several times, its only now 15 years after this book was published that I finally decided to read it. And now that I have gulped down the pages, I'm wondering what took me so long to envelop myself with this delightful book filld with Southern charm. And while it's also  safe to say than many readers and viewers are now familiar with the stories about Idgie and Ruth and Ninny and Evelyn, rarely does a book today offer such wonderful and endearing characters and a plot which has you racing to the last page.<br />While describing a friendship between two women some 60 years before and a present day relationship between a nursing home resident and her loyal visitor, the reader is set off on a roller coaster ride of emotions.  Dealing with subects as far reaching as women's liberation, homosexual relationships, rights of minority groups,integration and growing old, Fannie Flagg never fails to entice her readers and allow them to view a slice of American life now sadly gone.<br />It may have taken me all of this time to finally read a book by Fannie Flagg but if her any other titles are as good as this one, I surely will be in reader's heaven.  I already have Welcome to the World, Baby Girl and am eagerly waiting to begin it.  Maybe today's the day.
B00004U8H4|3.0|I'm one of the many fans of Bret Easton Ellis' master work of psychology and satire that is his book &quot;American Psycho&quot;.  Christian Blae plays an excellent Patrick Bateman, and communicating just how close he is to the edge all the time.  Unfortuantely, Mr. Bale is the shining light in an otherwise run of the mill psychological thriller.  As is the satus quo for most books made in to movies, the book far outstrips the film.  I understand the reduction in graphic violence, and the fact the film barely touched on his obession with brand names (clearance issues, I assume).  Mr. Bale provides a number laugh out loud moments.  Any scence, where the main character runs around an apartment building, naked, splattered with blood, with a running chainsaw can do nothing but make me laugh.  The movie did communicate the sense of satire better than the book, the book may have been to horrifying for me to see the satire.  Its a good movie if you haven't read the book.  If you've seen it and feel unfulfilled, pick up a copy of the book, it will make a lot more since.
B00004XMVH|1.0|If I could get my money back, I would. This is a fiction based on fact that Hollywood destroyed. The acting was awful, and the story strayed from the actual incident so much that it was laughable. Hollywood's use of special effects foreclosed any realism, so much that the movie is better described as ludicrous. I could not wait for it to end. Das Boot is a much better movie.
B00004XONN|5.0|I was not familiar with Radiohead's previous works.  Today I bought this album because my entire previous CD collection was stolen and I'm starting a new one (slowly but surely), and I figured that since I've heard some good things about it I should buy Kid A.  Egads!  It's excellent!  I can't believe a record label had the balls to put out something like this, but I'm glad they did.  Radiohead is going beyond the limits of their genre (beyond the limits of ANY genre) to make pure music.  Not rock music, or techno, or pop, just MUSIC.  It's wonderful.  The whole album flows and melds together so amazingly well.  It's like impressionism put to sound.  I have nothing but the highest praise for this album.
B00000DHR0|5.0|Beuatiful!  This CD nourishes the soul and uplifts the spirit. &quot;O Holy Night&quot; is marvelous but my favorite by far is &quot;God Bless Us Everyone!&quot;  It's hard not to smile when you hear it.  It's a lovely change from the standard tinny Christmas alsbums so many pop princesses rotely &quot;pop&quot; out each holiday.  Celine Dion is the real thing - it shows through in every note she sings.
0345377370|5.0|This is the best of the best when it comes to John Le Carre. I am a long time fan of Le Carre and this book is the cream of the crop from his selection.  I read this along with David Lehman's reissue of &quot;The Perfect Murder: A Study in Detection&quot; and found the two books perfect companions for anyone who loves sleuthing the classic spy/detective novel.
B00003CXDG|4.0|The only reason to watch MI2 is Dougray Scott!! I never even noticed Tom Cruise's character with Dougray Scott on the screen. He played Sean Ambrose brilliantly and I was cheering him on during the ending fight scenes. What Nyah Hall saw in Ethan Hunt I can never understand; his character was sooo boring!! Anyway, I only watch the scenes that Dougray Scott is in and thought he was the best actor in the movie.
0060931671|5.0|This is the best of the best when it comes to the modern detective novel by Thomas Pynchon. I am a long time fan and can say that Pynchon's detective sleuth is coming into high fashion at last.  I read Pynchon along with David Lehman's reissue of &quot;The Perfect Murder: A Study in Detection&quot; and found the two books perfect companions for anyone who loves the classic WHODUNIT in a brave new view.
B00004KD1L|4.0|This is a very good CD esp. for people that enjoy loungey electronic music but like it in easy to take doses.  Go see the band live if you can.  They are INCREDIBLE live.  Even better than the recorded music on the CD.

0679879269|5.0|I was lucky enough to start His Dark Materials late, after The Amber Spyglass came out, so I didn't have the horrible wait so many people suffered. But The Amber Spyglass, in my opinion, is truly a book worth waiting for.<br />Lyra and Will have grown so much from the characters we were introduced to in the first two books. They face horrible suffering for the sake of a promise, and give up everything for the safety of the worlds. Separated from their daemons, and lost in the terrifying World of the Dead, they keep going, tugged by the faint glimmer of hope that they CAN make a difference.<br />The story begins with the hated Mrs. Coulter keeping Lyra in enchanted sleep, as we see a side of her (Coulter) we've never imagined. Caring and kind, but with bitterness in her eyes, she has risked everything for the sake of her child. A battle erupts as both sides, so deeply woven we no longer know which we should root for, try to reach Lyra, one to kill, and the other to 'save'. With the help of the armored bear-king, Will manages to rescue his friend, only to then be put in unspeakable danger. The two are the most sought-after people in all the worlds, and they have their own destiny to create. On the run from the universe, they sneak away in the company of two spies, to finish some unfinished business regarding one of Lyra's friends, and Will's father. And that's only the first few chapters!<br />But meanwhile we're given an inside view of both sides in the enormous war against the Authority, always thinking we know what happens next, but being shocked as the tables turn. We see Dr. Mary Malone venture out into another world, where she learns the secret of the mysterious Dust, and befriends a race of wheeled creatures, whose existence relies on the enormous trees, dying from a Dust related problem. We also watch an assassin slowly creep closer to his mark, and an angel torn apart by the death of his lover.<br />The final battle between God and Lord Asrial's troops is brutal and descriptive, though quite possibly in vain, the one part I didn't like about the book. We finally learn the secret of Dust, and its effect on the world, and we learn the secret of the Subtle Knife, a secret so terrible it's almost better not knowing. The ending left me in tears, as Pullman didn't go for a happy-everything's-resolved-perfectly ending. It was sad but meaningful, and I truly identified with the characters.<br />All in all, it was definitely worth my time, and I recommend it to all Pullman fans, although I don't agree with the age group; I know a lot of adults that have loved it. The story of Lyra and Will is destined to become a classic.
0679735259|5.0|Without a doubt, this is the most heart-wrenching account I have ever read.  What makes it so powerful is that Michael Herr presents it by letting those who fought the ground war, the Marine grunts, tell it in their own words.  I highly recommend it for today's young people who only know VN as history; they need to know how horrible war really is--not as glamourized in the movies.  A MUST read.
B000002NJS|5.0|I'm not a huge Madonna fan, and this is the only album of hers that I have, but it's beautiful beyond words.  The music is haunting and quietly powerful.  The lyrics are poetic musings on life.  &quot;Drowned World/Substitute For Love&quot; isn't the strongest opening song, but it's pretty good.  &quot;Swim&quot; has a definite message that she wants to convey about the modern world.  &quot;Ray of Light&quot; is probably the best song on the CD, it's a great dance track but doesn't have dumb lyrics.  &quot;Candy Perfume Girl&quot; is more in the dance/pop style, and I think it's just OK.  &quot;Skin&quot; is more of a techno-style song.  &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot; is about how selfish she was in the past and how she's realized what's really important now.  &quot;Sky Fits Heaven&quot; is about getting started again (Travelin' down this road/Watching the signs as I go ...) &quot;Shanti/Ashtangi&quot; is cool because it's completely unexpected, a yoga chant set to music.  &quot;Frozen&quot; is one of my favorites, it's heartbreaking, deep and full of heart.  &quot;The Power of Goodbye&quot; is a beautiful, moving song about unfulfilled love.  &quot;To Have And Not To Hold&quot; is less powerful than the last two, but it's also about lost love.  &quot;Little Star&quot; is a sweet, touching ballad written for her daughter.  &quot;Mer Girl&quot; is mysterious and enigmatic, an appropriate ending track.  You don't have to be a Madonna fan to love this CD.
B00000JH09|4.0|the first time i heard one of there songs was in concert i didnt know who the hell they were but my jaw dropped and i was amazed this is hardcore metal with changing and very strange vocals .......after the concert was over i asked my buddy what he thought of the band and he said &quot;i didnt like the singers annoying voice&quot; which proved my point but i loved it becuase it was so different from other bands i bought the cd the next day and I was very pleased you should buy it too.

0399146253|5.0|I just finished TLP and I loved it!  It's surprising that so many 'fans' of the series seem disappointed with this effort, according to the other on-line reviews. As much as I loved the early Scarpetta novels, I found this one to be a refreshing change of pace that allowed me to get to know Kay more intimately.  Why should every single novel in a series have to follow the same tired formulas at the same breakneck pace?  It was interesting, creative and brilliant the way TLP played against Black Notice and what we thought we knew about Benton's death and Bray's motivations. I, for one, couldn't wait to have it sorted out.  I applaud Ms. Cornwell's courage in giving us a more introspective, thoughful forray into Kay's emotional life, while at the same time providing a springboard for a whole new set of adventures with Lucy in New York.  I couldn't put this one down (just like ALL the others) and was sorry when it had to end. I look forward to the next Scarpetta novel with the same enthusiasm that I always have.
006109594X|5.0|This book is a thrilling coaster ride from beginning to end!  You wonder if the catastrophe is plausible for 'real world' and then you have the attack on our very own USS Cole!  Patrick Robinson is right on key and this should be a wake up notice to our country to what could happen. Very well written, will keep you turning page after page well nto the night. I was so impressed that I have read each of his novels and hope there is another soon on the way.
B00003CWL6|5.0|My husband and I are movie buffs and watch a lot of films. American Beauty was certainly one of the best ones we had seen in a long time. We try to make it a rule and try to avoid the hype and the critics as much as we can so we can really form our own opinion when we see a movie. Well this one is a masterpiece. It is one of the few movies that actually succesfully joined comedy with drama. It all depends on how you look at things. I above all love the brutal honesty on how this film portraits the background of a so called picture perfect family. Kevin Spaceys performance is incredible and so is the rest of the cast's. If you are prudish this certainly is not a movie for you, even though I personally do not find it sexually offensive, but instead honestly refreshing. The musical score is by far one of the best I have heard in a long time too.
B00003CX8J|4.0|After witnessing comic-based abominations like &quot;Batman and Robin&quot;, fans should be well-pleased with Bryan Singer's near-flawless presentation of one of the greatest comic books of all time.<br />&quot;X-Men&quot; depicts the struggle of a small group of mutants, who must defend a world that hates and fears them.  The main story focuses on two of the mutants in particular - Rogue and Wolverine.  Brilliant performances by a very talented cast, including U.S. movie rookie Hugh Jackman, make X-men one of the best film adaptations since the original &quot;Batman&quot;.  While it's not likely to win any Oscars, it is entertaining enough to be worth adding to your DVD collection.
B000003TA4|5.0|I had never heard anything that has taken my breath away before this album. From the strong, catchy and energetic &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; to &quot;Come As You Are&quot; all the way through &quot;Something In The Way&quot; was not only a good cd, but an experience that i wont forget.
B00000HYXB|5.0|This album, after near constant listening for the last two years is as close to perfect as can be attained. I can't grow tired of it. I only hope their follow up will do this justice.
6305807930|4.0|Outstanding slice of Euro-Horror from Dario Argento; stylish, witty, surreal.  BUT -- how come Anchor Bay couldn't reproduce &quot;Inferno&quot; in it's proper 2:35:1 Techniscope ratio?  This company has done a real good job in terms of producing their DVD's in real widescreen letterbox format, for example their &quot;Deep Red&quot; disc.  Despite what the Internet Movie Database claims, &quot;Inferno&quot; is most definitley a 'Scope film -- Argento told me so himself at a retrospective in L.A. some years back.  (Buy the DVD anyway -- it's tremendous, so long as you care nothing about conventional character development and story-telling; this flick's all about dream-like sounds and imagery, much further out there than any other Argento work.)
B00004X01U|5.0|On this disc, Madonna--the most diversely talented human since the late Steve Allen--explores her heretofore unexplored country/western side with phenomenal results.<br />The opener, &quot;Music,&quot; carries the listener on a delightful magic carpet ride to a smoky honky-tonk, complete with sawdust on the floor and bottles a-flyin' through the air. She out Patsy Clines Patsy Cline when she pulls aching low notes from her diaphragm. <br />&quot;Impressive Instant&quot; explores the fleeting nature of love: a star struck female rodeo clown is impressed by a swaggering bull rider -- but only for an instant. The twang of a distant lap steel only adds to the heartbreak.<br />&quot;I Deserve It&quot; is about good love gone bad, as a trailer resident with low self-esteem cries herself to sleep at night after her nightly beating by her truck-driving husband. Willie Nelson ably acts the part of the hubby in this soul-wrenching duet.<br />&quot;What it Feels Like for a Girl&quot; answers an age-old question: why do girls like horseback riding so much? <br />Finally, &quot;Gone&quot; is a chicken-fried tribute to Greg Ginn's post-Black Flag days in the band by the same name. Merle Haggard lends his voice to this a cappela number; Madonna and Merle conjure memories of old-stlye barbershop quartets.<br />Bravo! Five Stars! Buy it Now!
B000006NPY|5.0|I must agree with the previous reviewer-music this good can't go forever ignored. Frankly I think this is one of the SP's best efforts. Siamese Dreams is the best but this is not bad, even with the drum machine. As a group I will miss them, but this CD reveals Corgan's brillance. I'm a fan of Billie no matter what his incarnation is taking him to. Don't expect to rock with Adore, expect to simply let it waft through you with gentle grace and angst.
6305126062|4.0|The USA is really two countries which co-exist in almost the same space. There is the country of educated elites (I hate the term, but can't think of a better one) who run the media and the universities and the government and have lost touch with the traditional culture and its values. This country is concentrated on the coasts. The other country is made up of the people who grow the food and build things and do most of the actual work. This nation exists mainly in the heartland. Neither group has much use for the other and don't communicate much except when a member of the elite has to pretend to be of the heartland to get elected. The scene that brought this home to me was the one where the editor from New York and her daughter sit down to dinner with the family in Montana. The family says grace, something which clearly startles the New Yorker as she scrambles to adapt to something that is alien to her but is as natural as breathing to her hosts. However powerful the romantic attraction that develops in the film, the cultural differences would be too much even without the inevitable personal baggage of their past relationships and present obligations. Spendid acting. Visually beautiful.
1573225517|4.0|An excellent story - I feel like I know the protagonist better than some of my friends. Entertaining insight into one possible male psyche.
630518299X|5.0|Jim Carrey gives a very different performance to in his other hit films, here portraying the emotional and real uncertainties of a man whose life is all fake and set up. As the film draws on he begins to sense that his world is false, leading to a phenomenal finale in which he attempts to sail away from the island created for him, realises that he can't and everything si false, and then is spoken to by his world's creator. The character conveyed throughout is unique, the subject matter is very touching and thought-provoking, and Peter Weir has pulled it off here.
0792839625|2.0|I saw this film in it's original theatrical run back in 1985, BEFORE seeing the stage production.  For the most part, I found it enjoyable (at the time), but wondered what the fuss over the show was all about.  About a year later, I had the opportunity to see the REAL version, on stage.  There simply is NO comparison between the two;  this film is a TERRIBLE attempt to capture the magic of the original show.  The only reason I chose to give it two stars instead of one, is because of the performances of the cast. For the most part, they are quite good, but even they cannot save the mess that the director, Richard Attenborough, allowed this film to become.  In the original show, &quot;What I Did For Love&quot;, aguably the musical's most touching moment, was performed by the entire cast.  It is a tribute to every performer's love for their craft as they answer a question posed by the &quot;director&quot; in the show's plot, (&quot;What do you do when you can no longer dance?&quot;) and anyone who has ever set foot on a stage cannot help but be moved by that scene.   So what in the WORLD was Richard Attenborough thinking when the high moment, and heart, of the show is reduced to nothing more than a half-baked love song sung by the character of &quot;Cassie&quot;, to the director, &quot;Zach&quot;?  Totally disgraceful. It changed the entire focus of the film!  And since several other reviewers have mentioned this, I, too, would like to complain about the cutting of some of the original score in favor of schlock like &quot;Surprise, Surprise&quot;, and &quot;Let Me Dance for You&quot;!   For pete's sake, &quot;The Music and the Mirror&quot; was the show-stopper in the stage version!  Again, Richard Attenborough, what WERE you thinking???  Also, much of the choreography was &quot;80-ized&quot;, making it look like a &quot;Flashdance&quot; clone......(no small wonder, Jeffery Hornaday was responsible, the same guy who worked on Flashdance......).  Only the finale of &quot;One&quot; comes close to the exuberance of the original, but even that one is pushing it.  If you have the chance to see this on stage, take it, and see the film ONLY as a last resort.
B000000WJZ|5.0|I heard this CD in 94 and here it is the year 2000 n' I'm still talking about how great a CD this is. It is a standard for anyone into altenative. <br />From Cherub Rock to Luna you are exhilarated at the same time stricken to sorrow. You really can't ask for a better CD.

0399146253|3.0|I am a big fan of Patricia Cornwell and I live in Richmond, Virginia so I always get a kick out of reading her books because I know a lot of the places and roads that she mentions. That part didn't let me down. But..... this book was really hard to keep up with and unless you have a great memory you really need to go back and re-read Black Notice because it takes off right where that one left off. It was a good book, I enjoyed it, but some of it was a little bit far fetched and just too ironic to be believable. I don't want to spoil anything for you, but I think you will know what I mean after reading it, and you should read it, because the ending is just another beginning for her next book and you can bet I will buy it the day it hits the streets.
0811826848|4.0|Hello to all fellow fans <br />I bought this book the day it came out, and excitedly began to read as soon as I got home. However, I found more joy that first day flipping through and looking at the (wonderful) photographs than actually reading, and I continue to feel the same way. As interesting as these different points of view and recollections are, the book becomes rather monotonous after 150 or so pages. I ended up skipping to commentaries on my favorite albums rather than reading from cover to cover. I would recommend this book to any avid fan, but if you're simply looking for a good read, I suggest you search elsewhere. (Don't take this wrong and think I don't like the music, because the Beatles albums are my favorite.)<br />Love it anyway -  Angela
B00004XOWM|4.0|This CD is in my opion the 3rd in a fall of limps ability though i really like rollin my genreation and the slower songs not to metion the acational rap but freds lyrics that seemed to reach out in 3 dollar bill and some significant other have almost vanished its as close to pop as ive ever seen. rollin, livin it up, hot dog, all good songs but pop like lyrics with no base. lyrics from nobody loves me and all the songs from 3 dollar were harsh and loud and sad and scary but great. these just arent the same
0156907399|2.0|I find it hard to believe this is one of the best novels ever.  Perhaps it's meaning was lost on me.. but I really did not enjoy this novel.  I had to struggle to complete it.  I was very dissapointed with the author and her over- monotonous, boring style.  It seems that this novel could have adequatley been told as a short story and would have only lost it's monotone and repetitive nature.  I kept looking for the literary genius buried deep within- but unfortunatley I never found it.
0553213105|5.0|I know, I know. How could I have let 19 years of my life pass by without reading this classic and constantly-alluded to novel? Yes, I delayed reading it for far too long, but it did not disappoint my anticipated expectations.<br />In the opening chapters of the novel I was *gasp* - bored with the plot and characters. I was blasphemously thinking, &quot;Why has everyone made such a hype about this book for the past century or so? It's just a bunch of prissy girls wasting their lives away by waiting around on parties, dates, and personal Prince Charmings to whisk them away&quot;.<br />However, as the novel went on, Austen's prowess at prose whisked me away, and I was totally intrigued. The Victorian world was opened up to me, and I tossed all former feminist theories momentarily aside as I became immersed in this setting, yearning for that time and place, where icould have lived like a princess and been loved by all, simply for being born female.<br />I loved Austen's depiction of the relationship between Elizabeth and Jane, and I saw the closeness of my own relationship with my sister reflected in it. I was amused by Mary's disgust in boys and her blatant disregard for most people. Lucy and Kitty's attempts to capture the eyes and hearts of possible suitors were timeless characterizations of so many girls, at that time period and today. Most of all, I loved Mr. Bennett's sense of humor, and his remarks (especially those directed toward Mrs. Bennet) made me laugh out loud throughout the book.<br />Count me in: I am the newest Jane Austen fan, and the one who deserves to receive the Procrastinator of the Century award for waiting so long to read her. For any of you who are putting off reading her like I did, there words of advice: do it, now. You will not be disappointed.
0684847248|2.0|My recommendation for reading this book is tear off the first two sections and read them by the light given off as you burn the second two.  Peck's first two sections have good sound advice about a healthy world view, testing one's theorie's, seperating the theory from reality, etc.  The main criticism of these sections is that they are highly repetitive and could be WAY shorter.  I can summarize the section entitled &quot;Falling in love&quot; in one sentence - puppy love is not true love.  Everyone together - DUH!<br />But we get a forshadowing of the nonsense to come in the summary of part I entitled &quot;Renunciation and Rebirth&quot;.  Here Peck commits the fallacy of authority over and over again as he demands the reader accept the absurd notion that birth and death are similar merely because he has dug up a lot of quotes from people that agree with him.  Then in &quot;The Work of Attention&quot; he hits us with some baseless newage &quot;It is entirely possible that he could sense within his audience the intensity of my concentration, my attention, my love and he may have been thereby rewarded.&quot;<br />It's all downhill from there, as Peck violates every soundmaxim he established in the first two sections.  Never was an author so schizophrenic.  He procedes to illustrate every fallacy and means of poor reasoning imaginable.  In &quot;Religion and Science&quot; he laughably tries to claim that religion and science are akin merely because both rely on assumptions.  The distinction between well-reasoned self-evident assumptions and those arbitrarily given from on high apparently eludes him.  In &quot;Scientific Tunnel Vision&quot; he completely misunderstands the difference between rejecting a claim which CANNOT be measured and a claim which is DIFFICULT to measure, and he also fails to explain how one is to determine truth or falsehood without measurements.<br />Finally, his final section, Grace, repeats the same two mistakes ad nauseum:<br />1) the presumption that his answer should be treated as plausible  if no one knows for sure what it is.  This ignores the fact that  one can know what an answer is NOT without knowing what it is.  Thus he claims that either there is a loving god or nothing, ignoring all other possibilities<br />2) His complete lack of understanding of probabilities, and how given enough people engaging in enough activities and looking for &quot;coincidences&quot;, many will be noticed COMPLETELY by chance.  To Peck, ANYTHING that occurs positively by chance is proof of the existence of his warped view of God.<br />It's just another example of a true-believer pounding his fist that we believe as he does, while giving us scant reason to do so  that any well-informed rational person would respond to.mption that his answer should be treated as plausible  if no one knows for sure what it is.

0767812417|5.0|I must say, I've never really been a fan of musicals perse, but four years ago, I caught this delightful film quite by accident on the Encore movie network, and have since changed my tune. I love movies, and I have always loved movies, but never before in my life have I got so much enjoyment out of watching one movie in my life, until I saw OLIVER! This is a musicalization of the Charles Dickens classic 'Oliver Twist' about a young boy who flees his drab life of workhouse servitude and falls in with a band of pickpockets led by the incorrigible Fagin(Ron Moody, Oscar-nominated). Mark Lester is absolutely magnificent in the title role. Jack Wild is equally winning as his slick sidekick, The Artful Dodger. In fact, Lester and Wild worked together so well in this film that they were reunited for the popular 1971 British release, MELODY. Oliver Reed is appropriately menacing as the brutish Bill Sykes, and Shani Wallis is lovely as his girlfriend, Nancy. The film was directed by Oliver Reed's uncle, Sir Carol Reed. Some might believe that this film pales in comparison to David Lean's more straightforward 1948 filmization. But there is little room for debate that Carol Reed's version is the more entertaining of the duo. OLIVER! is the last of the truly great movie musicals. It's easy to watch over and over again, and it's the type of film that looks better with every viewing. Thanks to the flawless quality of the 30th anniversary edition, the film looks better than ever! Required viewing for the classic movie lover.

B00004XOWM|4.0|When I first picked up *Chocolate Starfish*, I had expected it to be majorly toned down when compared to Limp's first two albums.  But as soon as I heard &quot;Hot Dog,&quot; a somewhat-tribute to Nine Inch Nails' &quot;Closer,&quot; I knew I had a permanant member for the ol' music collection.  Although some of the songs don't seem as inspired or emotional as those on previous albums, the album is still quite an enjoyable listening experience.  DMX, Method Man, and Redman have a good appearance on the latter version of &quot;Rollin',&quot; but Xibit's appearance on &quot;Getcha Groove On&quot; seems relatively unimportant in the grand scheme of things.  The guys of Limp Bizkit did another great job on an album that isn't neccessarily groundbreaking, and as long as the same basic formula to their music is retained, their success will last throughout this decade.

It allows young ones to touch, smell, and see objects, and also teaches other concepts (peek-a-boo and bye-bye). Has a British touch to it (&quot;Mummy&quot;), which we like, as well.
B00003CWN2|4.0|Unlike American Beauty, that poeticized fantasy about emotional upheaval in the quietly desperate suburbs, Boys Don't Cry is a raw, true tale about the hatred lying beneath the surface of daily life.<br />Teena Brandon was only 21 when she was raped and, a matter of days later, shot dead in a town south of Lincoln, Neb. Her crime: She wanted to be a man. Calling herself Brandon Teena, she flattened her breasts beneath surgical bandages, inserted stuffing into the crotch of her jeans and passed herself off as a boy among a small group of hard-drinking friends. She was found out and, like an enemy target detected by radar, destroyed.<br />Amazingly directed by Kimberly Peirce, Boys Don't Cry boasts a flawless performance by Swank (The Next Karate Kid) in the main role. The film has a sinewy tautness and, in its brutal ending, a visceral power. Teena can articulate her longing to change sexes, but the others, filled with fear and revulsion when they learn the truth, can only strike out wildly. The two men who rape her afterward call her &quot;little dude,&quot; almost affectionately. They seem to have no more self-awareness than dogs.<br />Raw and wrenching film of an outsider's tragic life.

0671027344|5.0|Man, oh man. I cannot say enough about this book. It's about the pain of growing up through the eyes of 15-year old, loveable yet alienated Charlie. It epitomizes the term &quot;coming of age&quot;, but in a way that's clever and relatable. The story is presented in a unique way, and has the potential to be a classic but is not hackneyed at all. Charlie writes funny, poignant letters to an anonymous friend in whom he confides every detail, every complex situation, every twisted new emotion. This book captures the very essense of what it feels like to be young and full of questions. Charlie is introverted and shy, troubled and slightly awkward, so when he finds people he really clicks with it's amazing. All of his stories are just like the memories I'm making right now, and he somehow finds the words to describe what some of us can just feel and know is real... like what it means to be infinite. This book is holds the type of writing that can be read and read again, evoking memories of stumbling among feelings and certain discoveries for the first time. It has the potential to mean something different each time, something deep and undeniably beautiful.
B0000025RI|5.0|VERY UP BEAT. MADE ME WANT TO DANCE
B0000203YT|5.0|Get thee to the nearest vcr and vieweth Shakespeare in Love, a delightful comedy that sparkles with wit, literary smarts, passionate romance and expert acting by a glossy, enthusiastic cast. Although this fancifully imagined episode from the life of William Shakespeare may not be every moviegoer's goblet of glee, viewers should have a merry old time.<br />The movie opens in 1593 in bustling London where Shakespeare (Fiennes), having left his wife and kids back in Stratford-upon-Avon, is in the dumps over his slumping love life and his latest comedy, Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter. Then he falls for lovely Lady Viola (Paltrow), a wealthy lass who auditions for Romeo and Ethel disguised as a boy (women were barred from the stage in Elizabethan times), and soon Shakespeare is happily hopping between bed and writing desk. And Lady Viola is twirling -- or rather untwirling,(a memorable scene) along with him. The course of true love never does run smooth, though, for Paltrow has a fianc&eacute; (Firth, stuffily amusing) who is hot to get his hands on her fortune by putting a ring on her finger.<br />Friskily directed by John Madden (Mrs. Brown) and cowritten by Marc Norman (Waterworld) and the preternaturally clever Tom Stoppard (Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead), Love would have us believe that this fictitious Viola is the Dark Lady of Shakespeare's sonnets and the inspiration for several of his best plays, including, of course, Romeo and Juliet.<br />Given Paltrow's radiant performance, the believing is easy. She imbues the character with intelligence, grace and a touching vulnerability. Fiennes (Ralph's bro), rather a dud as Lord Dudley in Elizabeth, shows more spark here, making Shakespeare a whirlwind of impetuous emotion and talent who learns the hard way that if all doesn't end well in real life, you can always make it do so in the next play.
B000007WO6|4.0|And that because Satriani always uses the same formula for his songs. He may be an instrumental guitar player but my big complaint about his music is his guitar solo parts. Most times he didn't play enough to join him but some times this tactic is better cause it letting you searching for more of him.  So, 4-1/2 because I believe this is the best album of Joe until now!  The atmosphere and his marvelous lucid ideas they are really transport you to another dimension. Joe combines his ideas and his favorite guitar sounds to unreachable for Satriani ethos &amp; melodies until now. A full instrumental disc, an excellent companion for travelling or for inspiring. Althrough Crystal Planet is one of his last work and many people believe is nothing more of his classical debute Surfing, Joe always find ways to surpise us.  No matter if you first listening to him, Joe Satriani Crystal Planet (especcialy now with the bonus track)is one of the best instrumental guitar albums ever, including a variety of styles like h.rock, blues-fusion phrasing and oriental influences. I wonder myself, which is this Crystal Planet that Satriani voyage with us.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This epic film starring Russell Crowe is a powerful and emotional experience. Though the film is quite long, you lose track of time while watching and it passes like seconds, leaving you wanting more.  Not only is the film interesting, it is also beautiful. The director uses images like Maximus' (Crowe) hand running over stalks of golden wheat and red flower petals falling from above in the arena to create a deeper meaning in scenes. You certainly can't go wrong with a film that combines heroism, survival, blood, and beauty. A must see film!
B00003CXDG|3.0|What separates MI2 from any of a handful of latter-day generic James Bond films?  Not much, really.<br />The concept of the Mission Impossible Force as a a TEAM of members, as in the original series and the first MI film, has given way to creating just another star vehicle for actor/producer Tom Cruise.  This movie exists SOLELY to present a buff Cruise as Mr. Action-Movie Hero, a territory he is relatively new to. As with many movies like this, plot and plausibility are secondary to whiz-bang effects and stunts.  A good script is the foundation that any good movie with staying-power is built upon.  Instead, MI2 is built AROUND something.  It is just an action showcase, that's all.  That this movie topped the box office in 2000 is testament only to the drawing power of Mr. Cruise and the public's diminishing discriminatory taste in intelligent script fare.  The popular media will have you believe that moviegoers' tastes are becoming more demanding and sophisticated, but you'd be hard-pressed to find evidence of that in this latest stunt-fest. But is the DVD worth renting?  Sure, for the DVD extras, behind the scenes technical goodies, and the MTV spoof.  But the movie lacks any elements to warrant ownership's repeat viewings.  Sure, the stunt setpieces are over-the-top and fun, but the minute a new movie can top it (and rest assured one will) MI2 will be just another discarded excess of its time.<br />Lump this movie in the same category as the insulting INDEPENDENCE DAY --  all style, no substance.

Somehow, they still retain clarity and precision, even when playing quickly.  This is the album that turned me on to the great works of John M with the Mahavishnu Orchestra.  <br />Definitely worth buying.

Mel Gibson is a great actor in this, and he played a Scottish man very well. This movie isn't for the faint of heart though, there are two big bloody battles, and a lot of poor defenseless little horses are killed in both of them :}. Mel Gibson isn't the only actor in this movie though, I cant think of their names right off the top of my head, but about 10 other people were superb in this movie, which is why I think it's the best movie ever made, then their is Saving Private Ryan with Tom Hanks, great acting, great movie, then The Perfect Storm, again, George Clooney, great actor, great movie. <br />So go out and get these three movies today!<br />Jesse  Go and get your copy of Braveheart today.<br />Jesse

6302638771|1.0|When you have a historical movie, I don't think you can just judge it on its dramatic effect. I think you have to also judge it on whether it is accurate. On the latter, JFK fails miserably. If you read the best book on the assassination CASE CLOSED by Gerald Posner, you'll see that this movie totally slanders Clay Shaw. Clay Shaw was found innocent in a court of law, the evidence since has held up his innocense, and that a paranoid like Oliver Stone should make slanderous crap like this and that people should praise it, is deeply deeply disturbing. I think the making of this movie was, in fact, a criminal act. (How would you like it if, after you died, someone made a movie about you, saying you had killed Nicole Brown Simpson...and a bunch of people on Amazon.com rated it 5 stars. Wouldn't be too fun, now, would it?)
B00000JCOV|5.0|I must say, when I heard Surfacing (edited of course) on my local radio station, I was stunned. Being a Spineshank/Korn/Soulfly fan, this album blew me away with songs like (sic), eyeless, surfacing, and prosthectics. If you have a little extra money, pick up their Digi-Pack, which includes 6 extra tracks (demo's, remixes, live.) I like &quot;Get This&quot; particulary. Not only do they amazingly blend soothing/screeching D.J. mixes with pissed off screaming vocals, but the guitar and bass riffs are fast, blazing, and sometimes even melodic. If you're a KoRn/Spineshank/Soulfly fan, you must, I repeat, MUST pick up this amazing album. You will be very pleased you did.

B00004TH83|5.0|This is Lara Fabian's first album in English and is an astonishing dbut in the world of anglophone pop. There is little evidence of Lara's roots in French music, with her Italian influences being more apparent, most strikingly in the opening track, the very beautiful &quot;Adagio&quot; - a dramatic ballad based on a classical piece. The Italian version of the song is also included. The album's greatest hit potential is provided by the absolutely stunning &quot;Part Of Me&quot;, with an obvious Madonna influence brought by Madonna's own producer, Patrick Leonard. The thirteen tracks span a range of musical styles from sensitive ballads, such as &quot;Love By Grace&quot; and the Streisand-like &quot;Broken Vow&quot;, to throbbing dance tracks, such as &quot;I Am Who I Am&quot; and the superb international hit &quot;I Will Love Again&quot;. &quot;Lara Fabian&quot; is a magnificent piece of work and sets an extremely high standard as Lara's first English-language offering. There is an obvious parallel with Cline Dion here and if you like Cline, you will love this album.

A film that describes life from two realms, a poignant life portrayed at its best by Ethan Hawke. Please see this creative, unique representation of what will become of humanity. Please! Thank you.
B00004YA66|3.0|A relatively intelligent sci-fi thriller that in the end doesn't really amount to much, \\"Frequency\\" emerges as a father/son reconciliation drama with a \\"Twilight Zone\\" twist.  Written by Toby Emmerich and directed by Gregory Hoblit, the film stars Dennis Quaid as a New York firefighter in 1969 who manages, through some fluke of nature, to contact his very own son, Johnny (Jim Caviezel), via short wave radio, thirty years in the future.  The filmmakers manage to come up with a surprisingly large number of narrative twists and turns to keep this potentially one-note premise intriguing and interesting as father and son come to know each other across the normally uncrossable chasm of time.  For instance, Johnny not only has to try to reverse history and prevent his father's untimely death in a fire in 1969, but also to thwart the murders of his mother and of several other women by a serial killer during that same time period.<br />A film like \\"Frequency\\" really doesn't have much going for it but the ingenuity of its plot.  Whenever it tries to get meaningful and touching, particularly in its exploration of the father/son relationship, the film dissolves in a puddle of hopelessly contrived and manufactured sentimentality.  On the other hand, \\"Frequency\\" does manage to keep to a minimum the maddening inconsistencies and lapses in logic that invariably accompany these time-bending scenarios.  Moreover, the filmmakers make clever use of the famous 1969 World Series, astutely finding ways to incorporate it into the fabric of the drama.  On a trivial level, the film does seem to suffer from an apparent oversight on the part of its makers.  The movie is supposed to be set in New York City in the Octobers of 1969 and 1999 - yet, correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't at least some of the trees be turning colors and dropping leaves by that time?  As far as we can tell, the movie seems to have been filmed during the summer months.  For a film whose very foundation is to question the very nature of time, this seemingly insignificant error looms larger than it perhaps otherwise might.<br />A film of this sort really doesn't stand up to too close scrutiny.  A viewer either accepts the incredibility of the premise and goes with it, or rejects the concept out of hand and moves on to another film.  Suffice it to say then that, given its fundamental plot-is-everything nature, \\"Frequency\\" makes for reasonably diverting and absorbing viewing.the very nature of time, this seemingly insignificant error looms larger than it perhaps otherwise might.<br />A film of this sort really doesn't stand up to too close scrutiny.

B00000IUT7|3.0|This engine is great fun ... as long as you don't use it on BRIO's own train tracks. The locomotive is bright red, it toots and whistles and has two headlights that will brighten up your kid's eyes. Unfortunately, it also needs lots of handholding, because it gets stuck quite often. In curves, especially going in reverse and up hills. The mighty red locomotive is a little too mighty and could use a slimming diet. I'm returning mine. A much better choice is the yellow engine which is also battery driven ... and uses just one AAA battery.

But I was wrong.<br />The golden compass introduces Lyra and her dæmon pantalaimon; the main characters of the story. It also introduces the alethiometer and Dust: a mysterious substance that the church seems to be afraid of.<br />The subtle knife introduces another main character (an important one at that) Will Pary. The subtle knife is also brought into light. <br />In the amber spyglass, Lyra and Will travel to the land of the dead to see if they can rescue their long -lost friends. The true Mrs. Coulter shows through, and Dust is finally understood. Finally, Will and Lyra realise that they must part and complete their task of closing all the wounds in the universe made by the subtle knife. And so his dark materials ends, in a sad, but perfect way.

I mean, Madonna knows what she's doing, generally.  I guess it's the electronic age, and I'd better get with the fricken' program.  It's probably great.

It's kind of obscure (there's a song about moles digging holes), but it's not depressing, and it's kind of cute. Cute in a Nightmare Before Christmas kind of way. I doubt I would have ever bought it on my own, but I got a recommendation, and I'm happy I did end up buying it. It's very pleasant.

B000002MFN|5.0|The least commercially successful of the diva's releases, &quot;Erotica' boasted such a diverse collection that, perhaps in 1992, it was too much of a variety to warrant large sales.<br />That withstanding, the album's blend of pop, dance, jazz, and sexual innuendo makes it her most intriguing offering.  Starting off with the sensual title cut, the artist then &quot;turns up the heat&quot; with a reworking of the classic &quot;Fever.&quot;  &quot;Bye, Bye, Baby&quot; sounds as if it may have been left from the &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; soundtrack with Madonna singing as if through a megaphone.  The hit single &quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot; is of the &quot;Vogue&quot; school of thought. Likewise, so are the songs &quot;Thief of Hearts&quot; and &quot;Words.&quot;<br />The ballads &quot;Where Life Begins,&quot; &quot;Bad Girl,&quot; &quot;Rain,&quot; and &quot;In this Life&quot; are subtle and indications of the interpretive skill that Madonna would exhibit years later with her work on &quot;Evita.&quot;<br />The most unusual of the cuts is the last one, &quot;Secret Garden,&quot; an intriguing blend of pop and jazz that lets Madonna be a little coyer than the previous offerings. The outro by the band features a dynamic piano accompaniment.
6305075468|5.0|The two creepiest films of all time, Nosferatu and the reality based &quot;M&quot;, are two films from the German expressionist era.  Hollywood has never been able to duplicate the creepy, mysterious and eerie atmosphere of these films.  The true terror of this film, which also relies heavily on shadows and darkness to convey additional terror, is due to the wonderful actor Max Schreck.  Murnau could not have made a better casting choice.  Even the remake with Klaus Kinski in 1979, cannot compare.  <br />Schreck's makeup and presense is truly the most frightening apparition that exists in motion picture history.  Some may argue this with Lon Chaney's Phantom, but that character was still a human.  The character that Schreck represents, Count Orlok, is an evil and monstrous entity which is &quot;undead.&quot;    Instead of a gory, bloody, Dr Phibes or Freddie Krueger face, we have a true rendition of a zombie-like creature with a face and formidible presense that would scare the dead!!  <br />For you curiosity seekers, I did some investigation on the web about Heir Schreck, he was actually a veteran of stage and 40 German films, of which most are very obscure, he was also married.  Fortunately, this movie has put him in modern conscience today (see &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, Tim Burton named his Christopher Walken villan Max Schreck in homage).  I think the charm of this film is that Max is a mysterious character and there is a rumor (I don't know how it started) that his name, &quot;Schreck&quot;, is not his real name.  It probably got started because the word &quot;schreck&quot; also means &quot;terror&quot; in German, a nice coincidence.  Actually &quot;Max Schreck&quot; WAS his real name, he was born in Berlin in 1879 and died in 1936 and I've seen pictures of him without his makeup (picture a cross between Boris Karloff and Buster Keaton).
B00004XMVH|4.0|I tend to rent those videos that I missed to few during their theatrical runs.  The case is the same for this greatly entertaining underwater saga from earlier this year.  I was not disappointed for it kept me mesmerized from beginning to end.  Sure, it has its &quot;holes&quot; like most Hollywood interpretations of historical events, but it still packs a wallop as a fine bit of patriotic and heroic flag-waving.  McConaughey, Jon Bon Jovi, Harvey Keitel (an actor who is so underrated), and the supporting cast are believable in their respective roles.  They exhibit the full gamut of emotions of sailors under fire.<br />I was also pleased with the addition of T.C. Carson as a Navy steward who played a more significant role in the success of the mission.  This characterization was, perhaps, a salute to Dory Miller, the cook who downed Japanese fighters during the perilous attack on Pearl Harbor during WWII.<br />I, for one, will purchase this one once the price is more agreeable.
B00003CWRX|5.0|This is a complex and political story about the 'fall' of the big tobacco companies at the hands of an 'insider' ex-executive. To me the greatness of this story is inside his mind. How he tries to weigh his options and understand what his fate will be.

The story is so rich it is beyond belief. Major credit to the actors and director! Worth seeing.

Even though the album wasn't her best, it did announce to the world the arrival of an artist who hitherto had been a cult favourite, at best.<br />It's a shame, then, that Is This Desire? didn't match the sales of To Bring You My Love, because it is in every way a superior album:  Melding the fatter hooks of earlier Harvey works like Dry and Rid of Me with the atmospherics and diverse arrangements explored on To Bring You My Love, Is This Desire? was easily Harvey's most balanced work up to that point.  &quot;Angelene&quot; is her slyest, most understated vocal performance, the quiet instrumentation conveying a sense of menace more hinted at that expressed; &quot;The Sky Lit Up&quot; features a slow build that resolves in a crippling, ferocious climax in the veins of the convulsive screams of &quot;Rid of Me&quot; and &quot;50ft. Queenie&quot;; and all the lyrics in general are more subtle, less angsty than Harvey's previous works, but no less powerful in their evocative power and flow.<br />I didn't hear this album until recently and it was quite the discovery.  As prodigious as Harvey's earliest works were (Dry was a mainstay on critics' best-of lists that year), she is an artist who's never stopped growing in her songwriting, instrumental and vocal prowess.  And the saga continues.
6300248569|5.0|First let me say that I am absolutely rabid about the Colin Firth production.  I own it and have watched it dozens of times.  The sequence went like this: I saw the 1940 version many years ago, loved it.  Then saw the 1996 version (loved it).  Then a year or so ago I read the book (of course loved it).  A month or so ago I ordered this BBC version and also the old 1940 version.  I HATED the 1940 version after having been exposed to all the others, including the book.  It bears little resemblance to Austen.  In it, Mr. Darcy begins to fawn all over Eliza about halfway through, completely out of character.  There are many scenes that are completely fictitious and thus unsatisfying.  Anyway, back to this 1985 BBC production: after I got over the initial shock of the less posh production values, I grew more admiring of the spirit of Austen embodied in this version.  It is definitely the closest to the book.  Eliza is smart and spirited, more so than in the Firth version.  Darcy is truly objectionable for most of the movie, and is not quite such a hunk as Firth.  This movie doesn't resonate with the romantic promise that so captivated everyone about the Firth version.  But it is immensely satisfyng none the less.  It presents Austen's vision much better- all the characters (with the possible exception of Jane, whom I thought was better portrayed in the 1996 version) are more complex and better represented- particularly the parents.  There are several issues explained in this version that left me puzzled in the 1996 version (for example, the significance of Wickham &amp; Lydia not having gone to Scotland: only in Scotland could you get married immediately, not possible in England).  I admit this is something of an obsession for me.  I've compared the book line for line with the videos and this contains more of the original.  Anyway, if you're mad about the A&amp;E version, I highly recommend that you get this one and watch it a couple of times- it will definitely fill outyour Pride and Prejudice experience.
B000001E7T|4.0|To Bring You My Love was PJ Harvey's breakthrough.  And it is ironic in that respect, because it probably stands as her strangest album (4-Track Demos excepted).  Relatively hookless, less raging rock and more disturbed atmospherics, To Bring You My Love is like an art-punk document, one part Velvet Underground, one part Nina Hagen.  I play it a lot less than any other Harvey album though it still brims with personality:  &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; almost reminds me of Led Zeppelin's cover of &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; -- heavily distorted, dramatic, and exhilarating.  On other spots Harvey waxes more ambiguous, less vitriolic than on her previous works:  The throbbing bass and whispered vocals of &quot;Meet Ze Monsta&quot; and the almost conventional blues singing of &quot;C'mon Billy&quot; aren't really to my taste, though they do showcase her agile vocals.<br />This album just doesn't do as much for me as Rid of Me, Dry, or Is This Desire?  However, it does provide an experimental bridge between Harvey's earliest era (1992-1994) and her more refined, yet expressive and fluid works since 1998.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I loved this, and I won't repeat the gist of other rave reviews.  It is very quiet, and slow-moving.  It will appeal to those who like subtle nuances- you have to watch people's faces closely.  Root was fabulous- what a face!  But mainly I wanted to counter another reviewer who thought Ciaran Hinds wrong for the part.  I thought he was PERFECT- glorious, masculine, not predictable.  He was awkward in the beginning because he was knocked for a loop because... well, I won't give it away but you find out later why he was off kilter.  I thought Ciaran simply marvelous- loved him in Jane Eyre too.  I don't know that this film will appeal to many men as slow-moving as it is, but women I know loved it.
B00004YW6I|5.0|Interesting -- the cover reminds me of Sleater-Kinney's The Hot Rock.  And like The Hot Rock, Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea is a turn for the more subtle, the introspective, the diverse.  Since 1995 PJ Harvey has been opting for a less overtly fiery kind of arrangement -- fewer punk-ish guitar riffs and brain-frying rhythms, while retaining her panache for cutting lyrical observations and vocal ability.  And I find her current direction highly accessible, taking the best from both worlds.  While the lyrical sentiments expressed in &quot;One Line&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Feeling&quot; may lead you to think she's gone soft, careful examination proves otherwise -- Harvey hasn't lost any of her sarcasm, she's just being increasingly sly with it.  And sonically this is one of her best albums, all ringing guitars (Harvey seemingly in transition in terms of her guitar sounds), crisp production and subtle shadings.  &quot;Big Exit&quot; evoke Patti Smith with its half-spoken, half-screamed vocal, backed by a relentlessly driving beat; &quot;Good Fortune&quot;'s assured, resonant lead vocal rank among Harvey's best; and &quot;One Line&quot;'s hiccupping rhythms are no less than mesmerizing.  &quot;We Float&quot; ends the album off on a hazy note, again, reminding me of Patti Smith (with the eerie mantra &quot;Elegie&quot;, the album-closer from Horses).  Some people may find Harvey's new, more textured, less overtly angry direction unappealing; however, I think it's a logical extension for her (how long can you continue screaming before you start sounding redundant)?  The richness and eloquence of Harvey's new sound appeal to me greatly, and though she no longer cuts loose as often with her voice, it remains a visceral, expressive wonder, except that it's now husky and suggestive instead of scratched and bleeding.  And Stories from the City...'s darker, enigmatic tones may prove even more fruitful for longterm exploration.  Instead of batting you over the headwith its points, this album hides them away and invites you to discover for yourself on your own time. I think that would make for even better listening in the long run.

B000001DYD|5.0|The cover says it all.  Emotions laid bare, defiance incarnate, grimy and harrowing, Rid of Me is a listening experience unlike any other.  The closest comparison is probably Nine Inch Nails' The Downward Spiral, except where Trent Reznor's main instruments are intricate sonics and technology, PJ Harvey's weapons are more primal -- Harvey's versatile, devastating voice; a battery-acid guitar sound and technique; volcanic songwriting; and a backbreaking backbeat.  Three-chord angst doesn't come on stronger than on title track &quot;Rid of Me&quot;, starting off as a faint whisper but plowing into an energetic monster in the veins of &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; come chorus time, drummer Robert Ellis supplying a degenerate scream (&quot;Lick my legs, I'm on fire&quot;) that sounds like it came straight from a Richard Kern film.  And as angry as Harvey is, she backs it up with punk hookery aplenty; &quot;50ft. Queenie&quot; could have been a Ramones hook in all its simplicity and raw adrenalized power, and &quot;Rub It 'til It Bleeds&quot; sounds like the unholy child of Nico and R.E.M.<br />My only reservation comes in the production front.  Though perhaps somewhat fitting for an album of this decayed nature, but I've never been fond of the way producer Steve Albini treats vocals.  As strong as Harvey's music is overall, her voice is still her preeminent instrument, and I would've liked to hear it a lot more than on here.  But to correct that, there's always the 4-Track Demos collection.  As it stands, Rid of Me is still a damned powerful piece of work.

B00003CXE7|5.0|I could not wait for Gladiator to come out, being a HUGE fan of Russell Crowe since I saw L.A. Confidential.  I dragged a friend of mine with me to watch it because she had never seen one of his movies.  Neither of us were dissappointed.  The movie captivated me from the beginning action sequence.  From there the movie just got better and better.  This movie is definatley a movie for both sexes too: for the men you have the obvious action, and for the women you have well, Russell Crowe.  Ridley Scott does a fantastic job directing this movie, bring ancient Rome back, forever immortalizing it.  Joaquin Pheonix is great in this movie, playing the perfect bad guy.  I hated his character just as much as Maximus does.  The graphics of this movie are awesome, i can just see the Collisseum in all it glory and feel the awe the citiznes must have felt just looking at the city.  As a person who took Latin and study Roman history, and watching tons of movies about this time period, I can honestly say that this by far teh best of out of all of them.
0399146253|3.0|I've been an avid fan of Patricia Cornwell since being introduced to her novel by a late friend.  However, I found this book difficult to continue.  At many times I forced myself to continue on wishing it would become a little more interesting.  Upon reaching the ending I was terribly dissappointed.  I will continue to remain a huge fan, but this book was the second worst to Hornets Nest.....and I just couldn't finish that one at all.
6304698658|3.0|My Family really enjoys this movie every year. We were all VERY  excited when it came out on DVD. But VERY disappointed in the full screen format. This was a theatrical release and deserves to be done in wide screen. The movie on its own gets 5 stars but this DVD only gets 3 stars. PLEASE RELEASE A WIDE SCREEN VERSION ON DVD SO WE CAN SEE WHAT WE'VE BEEN MISSING!! Thanks.
B000002MG1|5.0|My mom burned me the cd before I had a chance to listen to it.  she know I would like it, so when I got home later that night, I popped it in and I thought it was the best cd I have ever heard!  mellow songs, awsome lyrics and overall that it will pu you to sleep! if you have been looking for a cd to put put you to sleep this it the one you will put you to sleep in the 2nd song!  you must buy this cd!
B00004XONN|5.0|The samples you hear on this website do no justice to this album. I have so far listened to Kid A about 6 times in the past 5 days, headphones on, in a relatively secluded environment where I have few distractions, and I can't get enough of this CD. I didn't think that these guys could top OK Computer, but I think they might have. Time will tell, of course, but I keep thinking that if the music industry wasn't so splintered and balkanized, these guys would be as popular and as influential as the Beatles. <br />And I'm no giddy teen-ager. I've been buying music for 25 years now, and in many ways, I can't believe what I'm hearing.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|The Beatles made some of the best music ever but even so, nobody needs another greatest hits album, particulary one as unadventurous as this.  You probably own every song several times over already, and even if you are a newcomer looking for the best of the Beatles, some of the track choices here are highly questionable.  &quot;Love me do&quot; instead of &quot;Please please me&quot; or &quot;You can't do that&quot;?  No &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot;?  &quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko&quot; but no &quot;Back in the USSR&quot; or &quot;Don't let me down&quot;?  Get outa here!
B000000OPW|5.0|One of the Banshees best albums.  Composed well, songs like &quot;The Sweetest Chill&quot; and &quot;Lands End&quot; are so mystical, erotic, and eerie.  Other highlights are &quot;This Unrest, Partys Fall, Umbrella,&quot; and of course &quot;Cities In Dust.&quot;  This album includes four songs not on the cassette version + a remix of &quot;Cities in Dust.&quot;  A must for any Banshees' fan loyal or new.  Check out the Banshees &quot;Hyaena&quot; album also!
B000000W5B|5.0|The reason this truly great album gets negative reviews is because it followed Exile On Mainstreet. Even Sticky Fingers suffers by comparison to that masterpiece. Angie is the most famous, and a surely it is great. However, Winter, may just be the best song on the album. Taylor lays down a white hot guitar solo and Mick's voice sounds great. Keith was not very much involved with the creation of this album, during to his severe problems with heroin, at the time. He does, however, sing his best song in Coming Down Again. His awesome Chuck Berry lead on Star Star helps make it great. Taylor lays down great solos on 6 different songs here, turning average works like Hide Your Love and Silver Train into very good songs. I really think this was a great way to follow up Exile, by taking a turn in the opposite direction.
0679882820|5.0|I started reading this book to my daughter at 2 months.  She loves the funny sounds I make while reading.  Now that she is 3 months old, she can appreciate the colorful illustrations.  This book is just the right length to hold a baby's attention.  Also, this book is small, ideal for packing and to take on trips.
B00003CXDG|3.0|I am literally insulted by the stupididty of this movie..Ok so the mask thing worked ONCE in the first MI But Three times in the second?! give me a break..
B00003CWOL|4.0|First of all, before anything else, I must comment to all of you who might find this movie blasphemous... it really isn't.  This movie is never presented as truth or even really a parody on religion.  Rather, it takes some artistic license with a few beliefs, exagerates them, throws in a few ideas that are controversial and a few ideas that are quite astute observations, and makes it all quite humerous.  Don't look at this movie as if it's making fun of God, look at it like it's making fun of the people who really skew religion away from what it is in its foundation.  If you're one of those people, by all means, take offense.<br />Having said that, this movie is funny.  It's not my be-all-end-all funny movie, but it's up there.  Kevin Smith shows us again why we love his movies so much.  Probably the funniest part of this movie is Jay and Silent Bob.  They really shine like never before.  Jason Lee is good as Azrael, but I still feel he's better in more major roles like he had in Mallrats.  Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are great as the two fallen angels, giving us some great scenes with Damon re-filling his role as the angel of death.<br />On the *slightly* more serious side, Smith gives us several very poignant observations about Catholisism today, from the incredibly superficial Cardinal played by George Carlan to the words of Serendipity (Salma Hayek) concerning how modern Catholics treat their faith.  However, even these observations are treated with humor, and you can't help but laugh at &quot;the Buddy Christ&quot;.<br />In the end, this is just a funny movie on religion.  If you can't have a sense of humor at someone else's view on this, then don't watch it.  But as for the rest of us, we'll be watching it many times.
0783240236|5.0|If only more DVD's were this good!  Granted you may well get countless extras with more uptodate films (ala GLADIATOR, FIGHT CLUB, MEN IN BLACK etc), but films such as THE BIRDS often get overlooked in the extras department.  Not in this case though.<br />As one reviewer here so rightly stated, the extras here are quite staggering, particularly that documentary, which is the best I've seen on any film, ever.  You genuinely do learn more about the making of every aspect of the film than you could possibly have hoped for, especially in how Hitchcock brought his vision to the screen (the part where you learn that Hitch enjoyed the pre-production of the film more than the actual shooting, was for example something I didn't know).<br />As for the film itself, well it still stands the test of time as one of the most perfect examples of visual film making that you'll ever see.  Hitchcock's always treated the viewer with respect, allowing countless scenes of little or no dialolgue to tell the story.  It's a shame that more directors nowadays haven't the skill or guts to actually let the image tell the story.  True, some may have tried, such as the interesting but hugely flawed THE CELL, but it does seem that film makers like Hitchcock are a very rare species indeed.  <br />Huge plaudits go to the effects people too, particularly the genius of Albert Whitlock's matte paintings (that aerial bird's P.O.V. shot over the town of Bodaga Bay after the explosion at the petrol station is still a jaw-dropping moment), and it's a crime that their work failed to bring them an oscar.<br />The closest anyone has got to successfully matching or replicating Hitchcock's suspenseful style would be in Robert Zemeckis's jumpy and atmospheric WHAT LIES BENEATH, but at the end of the day there is and always will be only one true master of terror and suspense - Alfred Hitchcock himself.<br />A must have!
6305907145|5.0|While I may not be an Austin purist, I do love her work and was, thus, a bit hesitant to give this movie a go.  I finally took the plunge and was absolutely delighted.   Before I begin to go on about this film, it must be said that this book does not stay true to the book which, in the case of Mansfield Park, I do not consider flaw.  When one is attempting to create a film based on a beloved piece of ficton, there are always many obstacles to overcome--the main one being it's transformation to the screen.  One must remember, however, that often what makes a great work of fiction does not make a fine film.  Mansfield Park is just such a case. Ms. Rozema, however, does stay true to the nature of the Austin's work.  The characters are finely crafted and the supporting cast (not to mention the fine casting of Frances O'Connor as Fanny Price and Johnny Lee Miller as Edmund Bertrum) is tremendous.  The camera work employed hightens the viewer's understanding of Fanny's emotions (which lies at the center of this tale). As with the recent rash of period pieces, the wardrobes and settings are very well done.
080013558X|5.0|One of my personal favorites. How much better can one get than happily ever after?  Not true to the stage portrayal, but is the staged version true to the original little orphan annie cartoons, not really.

B000002LRX|1.0|I've browsed the other 70 reviews and have been overwhelemd by the stars.  I have to tell you, however, that Angel Dust is the worst album ever created.  My first college roommate played it every day (along with Empire from Queensryche) and it never grew on me.  This is an educated review. Why? -  I've heard this stinking album over and over and I hate it.  I'm glad FNM is dead and buried.
B000002MG1|5.0|When this album first came out, I was still a bit too young and too encumbered by the pop of my 9-year-old peers to appreciate it; but after a few years, I wised up to the breathtaking combination of Michael Stipe's lonely voice and the unusual, melodious strings on Automatic For the People.  Most random listeners are familiar with radio-station standards, such as the painfully pleading &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; and the jangly-sweet &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, and they're indeed awesome - but don't overlook the album's other greats, which is basically every single song!  One of REM's strengths is their willingness to be diverse in their music, and on Automatic a listener can find the haunting songs that make your head and heart pound (&quot;Drive&quot;, &quot;Sweetness Follows&quot;, &quot;Nightswimming&quot;), along with the more playful -but-thought-provoking tracks (&quot;The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight&quot;, &quot;Ignoreland&quot;).  Whether you've been an REM fan since their indie college radio days or only since you saw Man on the Moon, Automatic is a fantastic work that you'll never regret buying.
0780626494|3.0|This certainly is not a 5 Star movie, but it is fun and highly watchable.  I think any DVD collection would be made more complete with a copy of this film.  Fraser is very good in this movie and carries the whole thing.  Without his acting abilities, I dare say this film would be a 1-Star wonder.  Silverstone is fine but I think a better choice would be someone a little bit older.  She is difficult to imagine in this role as it feels like it was written for someone 10 years older.  This film to me is like &quot;comfort food&quot;....something that makes you feel at home like meatloaf and mashed potatoes.  When I am feeling harried from the work week, this film is a guilty pleasure to fall back on.   It is NOT great, but it is delightfully comfortable.
B00004Y7SF|2.0|This album is a big disappointment, as if somebody set the switch on &quot;Whitney&quot; and just left it there, results be damned.<br />It's one thing when vocal flourishes add to the emotion of a song; it's another when they're just there. There are so many vocal gymnastics on this record that I'd guess Christina had to visit a chiropractor when the recording sessions were finished.<br />That said, there are three songs on this album that turned out reasonably well. &quot;Merry Christmas, Baby&quot; has some of the gymnastics, but it does have the benefit of Dr. John, so it is an entertaining reading of the song. &quot;This Christmas&quot; is given a relatively straightforward reading, though Alexander O'Neal's 1988 version (from his &quot;My Gift To You&quot; album) is still the best. &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; appears in two versions - a straight rendering of the song, and a remix featuring a pleasing 70's-style disco groove.<br />The rest of the album is superfluous; it really would have made a better EP.
0452281881|5.0|the beauty of this book is that it's so true to office life.  i was laughing out loud and i had to cancel all of my plans so i could finish reading this.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie is wonderful and informative too!  I do not see any where why the rating is R when there is sleezy sexual content being passes as PG-13.  The worst in this movie could possibly by the fight with the tigers?  I think that is a shame for trying to keep a true history away from the minors is a complete shame!  I am a 15 year old and feel this is a great movie while being informative at the same time. Be sure to share this wonderful work with your child as my father did with me!  I am sure your son or daughter would appreciate it.
6305909326|5.0|This movie, though subtle, and centering around the investigation of a rare book reputed to conjure the devil, is full of suspense.  More importantly the movie is open to interpretation.<br />This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat through the movie and also keep you thinking about it for another week at least!
0399146253|2.0|I don't know what has happened to Patricia and her wonderful writing ability.  Something evidently is weighing very heavy on her mind these days, as it seems she has lost her touch.  The book never seemed to take off and get you going as all her others in the past.  Having been an avid Cornwell fan for years, I was very disappointed.  Perhaps her private life is getting to be a too much for her to handle and to be able to write as she once did.  This book was pure salami.
B00000GAIW|5.0|I bought my first recording of Aqualung when I was in my early 20's because it was (and is) the voice of my generation. If you are in your 40s and want to reminisce about the 1970's get Aqualung. If you aren't of that era and want to see what the fuss was about, get Aqualung. If you like great hard rock, get Aqualung. You can't miss with this one.

Otherwise it is ready for ears, ears, and ears.
6304698658|5.0|If this film is not already a Christmas classic, it will certainly be in that group a few years down the road. Aside from the &quot;Vacation&quot; series, this movie stands on its own legs as a hilarious look into the life of Clark W. Griswold, trying to give his family the great American Christmas.<br />There are very few slow moments in the film, which contributes to the fact that you can watch it over and over and over again, not getting sick of it (remember - a classic). It is also filled with countless memorable moments and one-liners, almost on par with &quot;Caddyshack&quot;.<br />This film succeeds on two levels of comedy. The first is that it manages to place its characters in funny *situations* as opposed to simply having them try to speak funny lines. This is the mark of a lasting movie. The second level of success is in the humor itself (the dialogue, the one-liners, etc.). It has what it takes to be a classic.<br />All in all, this is one that you buy. You'll throw it in again and again starting around mid-november, and it will soon become part of your Christmas tradition.
014028902X|1.0|OK,  well i have been MADE to read this book as a part of my english course. I started off and thought maybe its not that bad....but it is. Its awful. Dont even bother with it, its a waste of important time. So there in your face Gerald Durrell. Cheers
B00004ZB9D|5.0|This album is perfect for the newer fans of Lenny Kravitz.  It contains almost all of the best tracks from his albums, along with the new hit single &quot;Again.&quot;  For you people who aren't familiar with Kravitz's abilities, let me first say that through all of his albums, Kravitz writes all the lyrics, produces all the songs, and plays all the instruments.<br />  This is also a great collectors album for the more avid fans.<br />  Listen to all the basslines from this collection and you will be truly impressed.  He fills very impressively.<br /> The one problem with this album is that there are no live tracks on here. Kravitz is even better live.
B000002WU8|5.0|I read a lot of the comments made by others on albums before I make my own. I must say they are truly off. This is the best solo effort released by the Wu yet. Raekwon's vocals are so crisp and distinctive that you know he spent time preparing for this albums debut. Who cares if Ghostface is on a lot of the tracks, It only makes it a better album.
6301967992|4.0|I give it 4 stars because this movie is neatly done. I saw it several years ago at the Starlite Drive In located in Priceton, In. It was a refreshing different view! If you enjoy comedy and vampire flicks and if you don't mind the other themes in this film then i think you will like it.  Bumbling vampire killers, lookout!! While Bela would have put the bite to your neck, thse might have bit you somewhere else!
B000003AEA|5.0|This is the true epitome of what west coast gangsta rap should be. Goes down in the books as a true classic for me. It will never get better than this, truly a hard to top album. Top notch from head to toe. Last track &quot;Pump Pump&quot; still gets me hype to this day! If you lost this one, you better replace it.
630281474X|5.0|This is my favorite movie from Hammer! The Film bites so well that i still have the marks on my neck! If you like vampire films then this is one you cannot miss. Peter Cushing is brilliant as always and Christopher Lee does an great job as Dracula. This film is complete with good atmosphere, color, direction and so much more. Get it!!
0679805273|5.0|I received this book as a gift from my sister when I graduated from school. And you know something?  Not one of the many volumes of reference books I've read during college, nor one NY Times Bestseller's List novels I've picked up at the bookstore, has ever given me as much confidence and inspiration as this book.  Though I may not have been part of the audience in mind for this book, that in itself is what makes it so much fun. I get to enjoy Seuss' rhymes and illustrations just as any child would. If anyone is ever looking for a truly unique work of inspiration for the recent graduate, or for someone about to enter a new phase in their life, this book is the perfect gift.
0316548189|5.0|Whether your 15 like me or 85 like Mr. Nelson Mandela, you will learn, cherish, and be greatly inspired by his book.  I read this for my English 10 class in school, and at the beginning thought it was just a book for english that I had to read.  Boy, was I wrong.  By the time I got half way through this 544 page book, I would be doing something else and actually wanting to go read this book.  Not many books, especially memoirs, do that to me.  The last memoir I read, I hated, so I thought that this one would be boring too.  How could I have been so wrong!!  Mandela has great courage not only for going through all he has, but for laying out himself for the world to read about.  Before I read this book I knew little about him, except he was a great freedom fighter for the African, Indian, and Coloured people of South Africa.  I am one of those people who don't understand racist people to be more unsophiscated, they make me angry.  I was greatly intrigued by Mandela, and this book goes on the top of my favorite books list.  It is a need-to-read book.
0375420525|5.0|Not just fiction...not even a thriller. It is hard enough to put yourself rapped up in the 708 pages of a book, leaving no space (space?/darkness/a cool hand) untouched, just to state the obvious: when dreams turn to nightmares you have to do something about it. It was about time...
B000002OX3|5.0|first of all i'd like to say, i was very dissappointed the first time i heard this album.  most dissappointing was the MONO sound and poor quality.  the second time through, i absolutely loved it.  strange, but true.<br />&quot;Run, Run, Run&quot; is just full of rock fun.  as one reviewer previously pointed out, it does sound similar to &quot;My Generation&quot;.  as an added bonus, it's Stereo.  John Entwistle's first composition on the album, &quot;Boris the Spider&quot;, is funny and clever.  i just love those low vocals singing &quot;BOOORIS THE SPIIIDER&quot;.<br />Keith Moon's &quot;I Need You&quot; is surprisingly good.  John's &quot;Whiskey Man&quot; is again very clever, very reminiscent of Harvey.  &quot;Heatwave&quot; is easily the weakest track of the 10 original album tracks.  Keith Moon's second composition &quot;Cobwebs &amp; Strange&quot; is entertaining all the way through.  Keith's thunderous drumming is definitely the star of this track.  &quot;Don't Look Away&quot; has a nice melody and Beach Boy-ish harmonies.  &quot;See My Way&quot; has one of the catchiest melodies on the entire album.  it's surprising Roger turned out so few songs.  &quot;So Sad About Us&quot; is another solid song with great harmonies.<br />obviously the stand-out track on this album is the title cut.  more digestable than &quot;Tommy&quot; or &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;, this (almost) 10 minute mini-opera never gets dull.  clever, funny, entertaining, and musically dynamic, &quot;A Quick One (While He's Away)&quot; is something all it's own.  i personally think that the &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; version is superior to the album version, though.  there is just so much energy in the live version.  the parts that stand out the most are &quot;Crying Town&quot; and an extended and much better sung &quot;You Are Forgiven&quot; (for those who haven't heard the song, these are the different movements of the song).<br />as an extra special treat, this CD has a whopping 10 bonus tracks!  &quot;Batman&quot;, is a personal favorite.  it's so funny and out of place on the album.  i have no clue why they performed this song for the &quot;Ready Steady Who&quot; performance.  &quot;Bucket T&quot; and &quot;Barbara Ann&quot; are equally out of place, but not as funny.<br />&quot;Disguises&quot; is a great song, similar in concept to &quot;Whiskey Man&quot;.  &quot;Doctor, Doctor&quot; is anther well-written song by John.  &quot;I've Been Away&quot; is the humorous tale of a man wrongly imprisoned for his brother's crimes.  &quot;In the City&quot; is a forgettable Moon/Entwistle B-side.  &quot;Happy Jack (acoustic version)&quot; is interesting, but falls short (it's a con that they didn't just include the original &quot;Happy Jack&quot;, which would have easily fit on this CD).  &quot;Man With the Money&quot; is another forgettable cover.  &quot;My Generation/Land of Hope and Glory&quot; is funny, if nothing else.<br />definitely an essential album, and the 10 bonus tracks are just sweet!
B00003W8NM|5.0|This is movie making at it's best. What seems like only a very violent and pointless movie is actually one of the most thought provoking pieces of cinema in a long time.  The ending of this movie is beyond belief and dare i say even better than the one in the sixth sense.  What's more is that this dvd is chock full of special features that will take hours to get through.  You must buy this, this warrents the purchase of a dvd player in itself.
0780020693|5.0|Lovely nostalgic film, absolutly classic for those with an honest sense of humor and a non-american concern for political correction. A film that manages to illustrate the ridiculous pettyness of life, simultaneously and successfully existing within a culture firmly set in its old ways - This is something that everyone is trying to achieve. Bread and Butter!!
B000002JEV|5.0|This is a must-buy for anyone who likes zeppelin. Great renditions of earlier material you just can't beat an 18 minute dazed and confused, an epic whole lotta love medley, and the first live performance of stairway to heaven. plus it is the only cd where you can get travelling riverside blues (unless you want to spend $70 for the box set), the girl i love, and somethin' else.
0312243022|5.0|wow! an amazing piece of writing that moves the reader from the outset. cunningham establishes these female characters so completely that you forget that it was in fact written by a man. what insight!
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix is beyond words.  It is so much more than a movie.  I can't describe my feelings toward this movie.  Besides the movies itself there are a lot of great features on this dvd worth checking out including extensive making-of footage and so much more.  I cannot wait until the two sequels.
B00004U8P9|1.0|I have found this DVD extremely frustrating. I am a big fan of this movie and purchased the DVD planing to watch it on my computer which always worked fine with other DVD movies.  However despite many hours of downloading drivers and various programs I have not been able to view this DVD.  What is worse my computer is now not working as well as it did before. Based on my experience I sugest that you take care with this DVD if you are planning to view it with a DVD ROM drive.
B00004TL21|5.0|With White Pony the Deftones have proved themselves to be much more than the typical metal bands being played on the radio today. For this alone they should get a lot of respect.  The songs themselves are really good and there are some to headband to and some to groove to.  Passenger with Maynard James Keenan is one of the best songs I've heard in awhile.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I am impressed by Capitol Records releasing somthing they should have years ago...all the number ones in chronological order! This will be helpful to new generations discovering the Beatles, but for those of us who were cheering them on in their heyday, this will be a magnificent journey down memory lane. No more playing different CDs (or vinyl in my case) trying to track down the original hits. This is very convenient and highly anticipated. Thank you, Capitol Records, for proving once again your label is one of the best in the industry!!
6305594252|5.0|I was swept away by the movie Stargate. It just fascinated me in so many ways. If you haven't seen it you need to get this movie and watch it for yourself. I know it is just another sic-fi movie but I really enjoyed it and have since been reading the Stargate books by Bill McCay which you should also check out if you wandered &quot;what now?&quot; at the end of the movie.
0140544518|5.0|Talk about &quot;the flip side!&quot;  This book was great.  Jon Sceiszka has done a great job of protraying the wolf as a inocent victim.  The true story was about a sneeze and a cup of sugar.  The way that he inter-weaved the two stories was perfect.  Jon told the wolfs side well without changing the original pattern of the story.    I am a college student and a future teacher of America.  I really enjoyed reading this book.  I remember when it was first released and my 4th grade teacher read it in class!  I loved it then and I love it now!  This book is the perfect book to teach point of view, when comparing it to the traditional three little pigs story.  It's also a good way to discuss the impact of media.
B0000028MA|5.0|This soundtrack is the perfect companion piece to the Seattle Music Scene (even more than hype!).  All the songs are great including two spectacular ones from pearl jam, a great new soundgarden, the classic mlb song crown of thorns, and the epic drown from smashing pumpkins as well as mudhoney, screaming trees, jimi hendrix, paul westerberg, alice in chains, and the first chris cornell solo song.  Only a few of the songs are available on other CD's and if you loved this period of music and were as fascinated with the whole Seattle Scene as I was then you owe it to yourself to pick up this soundtrack.
B00005176F|4.0|Finally, a compilation of songs from one of Britain's most inventive and creative bands - Blur. Usually, a compilation would signal the demise of a fading band, and act as a desperate measure to maintain their appeal (read: Oasis' Masterplan ). But not this time. As in their new single, &quot;Music is My Radar&quot;, Blur shows clearly where they are heading next. The album recollects their ten year history with an array of songs of very different styles. Ranging from the Nirvana-influenced &quot;Song 2&quot; to the alluring &quot;Tender&quot;, Damon Albarn shows the world just why they are here to stay even after these ten years. Gone is their troubled past, and they have since gone on with their own business. Right now, the album blends a mixture of songs into a potent cocktail. That's how music should be made. Certainly, it's an album to savour, Blur fans or not. No doubt this band will be around for quite a while more. Liam and Noel, are you listening?
0399146253|3.0|I read this fairly quickly, it was OK.  It tied up some loose ends from Black Notice, but left new ones hanging.  I'm with the readers who are very tired of the characters 'moping around' for lack of a better phrase.  I saw glimmers in this book of the old Kay, buried under all the introspection.  But this book felt too much like a transition between Black Notice and what it obviously going to be a next book in the series.  Let's hope it moves the characters forward, out of this slump.  I'd like to think they'll move beyond Benton, but it sounds like he's tied up in whatever is going on.
B000002HJD|5.0|If you don't understand Morrison you won't understand this album and what does ROB O'CONNOR know about poetry anyway? Hey Rob, go review something more you're caliber like greenday
B00000IOSU|5.0|I am not a very big of &quot;live&quot; albums/CD's.  I usually find them lacking in emotion and the music too &quot;loud&quot; and &quot;overpowering.&quot; The applause out of control. This CD dispells my opinion of all of this.   I love the more upbeat, dare I say rock tempo of the songs ~ especially Building a Mystery (one of my favs) and Terms, a song I relate a little to well too.  The audience participation in Icecream is exuberant and happy.    One of the things that I adore about Sarah McLachlan's music is the haunting/spiritual aura that it holds.  That is not lost in the concert setting of this CD. Which is another reason why I recommend it. You can still very much feel what she is singing about.   I would recommend this CD not only to fans but to anyone that thinks that they may enjoy her music.  It is a good introduction to her, not to mention a wonderful addition to any music collection.
0060194995|5.0|I am sure that I am not the only one who considers To Kill a Mockingbird their favorite book.  I was required to read this book in grade school, and my resentment for being forced to do so quickly turned into a hunger to finish it, read it again, and numerous times thereafter. I know of few other books that I can say this about. The charaters are endearing, and the story is incredibly written. Everyone should read it at least once in a lifetime.
B000002L7J|5.0|The songs are great and Morrissey is certainly a unique talent worthy of note.  What is the most amazing thing is Johnny Marr's ability to create a sonic landscape second to none.  What he has done here is set a standard for rhythym guitar playing that will always stick in my mind.  His skill level is second to none.
0399146253|1.0|Skip the first boring and depressing 150 pages -- and Kay's pity party that  says over and over and over and over and over  how terrible it is to be victimized -- which if you bought this book is the way you will feel.  And unfortunately, Kay comes across as a neurotic, angry, whining mess -- not someone  you really want to spend much time with, let alone the time it takes to read over 400 pages.  If Corwall wanted us to understand how the victim of a crime feels, it didn't work.  It a takes a third of this book for a real plot to start -- then fizzle out fast.  Unless  the author plans to stop the series, we know that Kay will survive being accused of murder.  The really interesting details of  Kay's position  as a forensic pathologist are missing.  When she does start an interesting case, it is lost immediately in Kay's personal problems and shell shocked non functioning while waiting for everyone else to save her.  So, you might want to save your time for something more interesting -- I wish I had.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This CD demands to be shared. Buy it for the convenience, sure, one CD with nearly 80 minutes of some of the best pop ever recorded. But your mission, should you decide to accept, is to buy this CD for everyone under 21 or so you know or love who is only casually acquainted with The Beatles. (In other words, they don't actually OWN a Beatles CD of their own.) It won't set you back but a few bones (unlike the ridiculously priced &quot;Blue&quot; and &quot;Red&quot; collections)and makes a perfect under $15 gift for people who think the boy bands or Brittany Spears are great musicians. Truly inspiring artists as diverse as Robbie Williams and Elvis Costello have said they owe everything to the Beatles, so help the unanointed find out why. This CD is the benchmark by which all pop music, then and now, can, and should be judged. Finally, a Beatles bargain!
0553106635|5.0|I, too, reviewed the previous volumes and only add my voice now to confirm what everyone has said.  This third installment is everything the first two were and more.  It is the first time in my experience that a series has so approached The Lord of The Ring's standard of conflicted characters and intertwined destinies, set against a backdrop of medieval action and only _hints_ of the magical.  I hadn't realized how tired I was of reading the same basic story of a male hero tromping off to some absurdly spectacular destiny with only the details needing to be filled in, until I began these novels.  If you're bored by the bloated tedium of Jordan's 97th Wheel of Time book, or the unremittingly strict good/evil character categories of others such as Eddings or Brooks, welcome.  You will not be disappointed. My only complaint, albeit a very minor one, is that as the plots in this third volume are shredded and rewoven during its telling, Martin does loose his grip a bit by allowing each viewpoint chapter to end with a cliffhanger.  Predictably unpredictable, you find yourself dreading that last paragraph simply because you know something terrible is going to happen.  This is likely intentional, as befitting the chaos of the time, but it is a departure from the earlier books.<br />Finally, I wish to point out (as others may have) that you may find a short story written by Martin and set about 100 years before The Song of Fire And Ice in 'Legends 2' (&quot;The Hedge Knight&quot;).  This is the softcover version of 'Legends', and contains only two other short stories in addition to Martin's.  This is fine, however, because Martin's tale is so superior I felt glad that no other people were forced to share the fate of being outshone by him.
068485015X|5.0|This is a powerful book and can cause you to grow and reassess yourself and your place in the world if you will let it.  It is not for everyone and I suspect most people may not be able to finish it.  I found reflections of myself and the decisions I made in my life on every page.  If you are introspective then this is the book to guide you on your journey......
6305971153|5.0|I have enjoyed this movie since its release in 1985.  The music definitely puts you in that Christmas spirit.  The song &quot;Christmas All Over the World&quot; by Sheena Easton is a classic in itself. I would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys the holiday season.  The story is gentle enough for little ones but just as enjoyable for adults.  As an added bonus on the DVD edition, you get to to see a 50 minute &quot;Making of Santa Claus the Movie&quot; and director's commentary.
B00003CXDG|1.0|MI2 is simply a bad movie.  It is classified as an action movie but really most of it is not action, just bad dialogue.  MI2's premise is not bad, Hunt trying to recover a deadly strain of influenza from his arch enemy, but it is all just flushed down the toilet.  There is some action, but in no way does this film compare to its predecessor, very disappointing considering it was directed by one of the very best action directors of all time, John Woo.  If you are a serious fan of MI or a Cruise fanatic then rent this (certainly don't buy it), however for casual fans of action films, you can do better by just watching the original again.
B00004Z4WR|2.0|...it remains pretty pale compared to the original from 1974 that was directed, produced and written by H.B. Halicki, who also starred as the main character Maindrian Pace. Oh, and he did his own stunts as well.<br />Had not Halicki perished during filming of the sequel in 1989 (a water tower fell too early and crushed the car Halicki was driving), he would have been the obvious choice to direct a WORTHY remake of the best car-chasing movie of all times.<br />Car-chase movies were a lot better in the 70's (the Driver ('78) and Cannonball ('76) (no, NOT the Burt Reynolds comedy) for example), with the rare exception of new movies like Ronin. Watch the original Gone in 60 Seconds, and I promise you will look at the 2000 remake in a totally new light.
0767802659|1.0|Starship Troopers had a old idea, make a movie about big bugs and guys with big guns killing them. Hey, that would be worth it.  What you don't know is that you have to sit through a sappy love story that seems written by a day dreaming fifth grader. This takes up half the time, played out by professional models rather than actors. The future looks like &quot;Teen&quot; magazine. As such the lines are said for the simple sake of having them said. The characters have no real depth beyond yelling things and shooting things. Once the action picks up there isn't anything to cry about, lots of big bugs getting ripped apart with major firepower. Stimulating as little of the viewer's brain as possible. But to get there you should skip the first half of the movie.<br />Now if you want a real sci-fi flick with marines and bugs go get Aliens and stop throwing away your money.
B000002HJD|2.0|Look, I myself am a Doors fan and habe been since I was 10(I'm 27 now). But instead of being a Jim Morrison worshipper, I think that really the whole band was good, which is why the songs worked. Imagine if Morrison had a Strawberry Alarm Clock backing him?How would 'The End' have sounded then?I think Jim was a great singer, able to pull off a sinatra croon or a racous blues. But his lyrics were sometimes interesting and sometimes insipid. This recording is kind of pointless, full of cocaine fueled dribble. The Doors sound okay, they must have wanted to record together again, but this recording is just ghoulish. Skip it.
0800177177|2.0|Having seen the film when it first arrived in theaters in 1992, I revisited this lavish production for the second time last night. In 1992, I remember being vaguely impressed by Coppola's staging and artful cinematography. Indeed, this is one of the only aspects of the film that holds up under any kind of scrutiny. It receives ONE star for remaining coherently faithful to Stoker's classic novel. ONE star for Coppola's artfulness, and ONE more star for Oldman's competent interpretation as Vlad Dracul. What? You notice I've given the film only TWO stars. That's because 'Dracula' loses an entire star for casting the two most dubious actors in the Hollywood pantheon of nitwits: Winona Ryder and, far worse, Keanu Reeves. Ryder's performance as Mina is thoroughly unbelievable, with her whiny Petaluma rugrat voice underscoring just how horrible her faux English accent is. (And we thought Madonna sounded bad trying to cop a Brit-brogue.)'DEE-AH DEE-AH JONathon, I wish I HOD the CHONCE to tell YOU how VEY VEY much I WAH-SHIP YOU.' Just plain bad is squeaky little Winona. As for Reeves, he is painful to watch when he opens his mouth. Thoroughly and unequivocably talentless. Pure wood. Stilted. Vacant as a beachside motel in the Arctic. His stab at an English accent brings the film almost to a level of light comedy, which was certainly not intended. Anthony Hopkins hams it up as Von Helsing, perhaps shocked by the necessity of working with 'stars' who appear to have been airlifted straight from their jobs straightening slacks at the Gap.    Aside from these transgressions, the film makes a case for itself visually, and especially with Oldman's tortured performance. Though the extraordinary costumes make for an added delight, this film is not nearly as appealing as 'Interview With A Vampire.'
0380730367|4.0|Pat, Angie, &amp; Bubba are pulled into the world of another psychotic when Patrick finds an ex-client has committed suicide.  His investigation reveals a life gone to hell bit by bit in six months leading to a fatal plunge.  They uncover a web of insidiousness that leads to a man who enjoys destroying lives slowly.  A ruthless killer, he destroys any who get in his way-friend or foe.  This is another excellent Boston PI story from Lehane.  Now I have to wait until February for his latest.
6304140711|5.0|I saw this movie a long time ago, but I still remember it. And for me to remember a movie means that it must have really been something! This movie was really great and I enjoyed it. I guess I'm the type of person who enjoys being thrilled and chilled and this movie gave me tons of both. I loved the storyline-- obsessive out-of-control guy meets innocent girl. And although people say that that storyline is old, this movie was as fresh as ever. It really gave a new outlook to the old storyline and gave it so much suspense. I enjoyed every second of this movie. If it was a book it would be the type where you can't put it down because it is so good. This movie kept me guessing and made me look forward to what was going to happen next. And in my opinion, that is the effect a GOOD movie should have on its viewers. Mark Wahlberg gave a great performance and he really fit the role well. He made you believe you were right there experiencing everything. This movie was simply amazing. There should be more movies like this. It was hot, it was suspensful and exciting. I loved it!
0812550757|4.0|My review of this book is probably influenced by the fact that Orson Scott Card is my favorite writer, and I like anything that he writes. However, 'Speaker for the Dead' is truly a worthy succesor to 'Ender's Game'. If you liked 'Ender's Game', you'll almost certainly like 'Speaker for the Dead'.<br />'Speaker for the Dead' lacks the emotional connection that one has when reading 'Ender's Game'. But the words on the pages are well written and the story is very interesting. Card is truly a master of science-fiction, and the 'Ender's Game' saga is undoubtebly one of the best series' ever written, and rivals such great works as 'Dune'. <br />If you like science-fiction, read 'Ender's Game' and then read 'Speaker for the Dead'. You won't be disappointed.
B000002LR3|5.0|Some albums define a band.  Some define a year.  Screamadelica defined a seismic shift in the direction of British music.<br />Primal Scream tore down the barriers between rock, dance and indie and recorded a classic.<br />Its nearly 10 years old, but you would never notice - it is as fresh, enlightening and, frankly, stunning as it was in 1991.<br />If this CD is not in your collection, shame on you!
B00004XOWM|2.0|I like Limp Bizkit quite a bit however, I feel this was a very poor cd and didn't meet any of my expectations.  It appears as if Limp Bizkit is trying to aquire a new style, that just didn't work.  It's half rap half is some semblence of the alternative style they have devolped previous to this cd.  It is possibly the most conceited album ever created, with the use of their name in almost every song.  Further, the lyrics have something to be desired, specifically in songs like Rollin' (both versions) and My Generation, in fact they come off as goofy. I ask you to save your money on this cd, and not make the mistake I have.
0156907399|2.0|I am aware of how important Woolf's work is in the context of early 20th century literature.  I'm also aware that Woolf is someone who many respect, but whose style they may not necessarily like.  I am one of those people.  Woolf's experimental style--stream of consciousness--is revolutionary, coming at a time when most writers began to break free of Pre-WWI literary conventions.<br />However, she remains, to this day, someone who is difficult to read and difficult to comprehend.  Reading &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; was relatively easy.  But understanding it was not.  To be more vulgar, it was so boring, I lost any sense of awareness of the story and the characters.  Some say Mrs. Ramsay's thoughts were complex and ahead of her time; I say they were small and meaningless.  And the men were even smaller, even more base.  The experiment with the text was successful, but the story's worth can easily be debated.
630575067X|5.0|You will probably see a lot of 1 star ratings saying, &quot;it sucked&quot; or &quot;Jar jar is dum&quot; by a lot of people desperate for attention. Bottom line: Unless you are worried about looking not cool for liking Star Wars, over-obsessed with ANH and ESB to the point where you hate every new SW movie since ROJ and the concepts that come with it, YOU WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE.<br />It has everything to offer: fun, excitment, humor, great characters, lots of emotions, and deeper levels, like SW's mythic ties, all the great themes, metaphors and symbolisms that come with it.  The midichlorians are sheer brilliance, and are very important to the movie.  The battle scenes are great, as are the character scenes.  Portman rules as Padme Amidala, the best character in the film, and the best character in all of SW.  JW's score is great again.<br />So basically, see the movie, and enjoy it!
B00003CXDG|2.0|Very little can be said about this movie. Don't waste your time with purchasing it. It may be worth wasting $4. on a rental, but thats it! This movie was dull,un-interesting, bland, a travesty of all that is holy in action films. Yes there was a time when an action film had a good story. These days all we get are cartoon special effects, bad acting, (Who the hell like's Cruise anyway?)and witty one liners my eight year brother thinks are funny. No amount of special features on these discs can be even a little consolation. I only gave it two stars because it made me laugh at how bad a movie can be.
B00004XOWM|1.0|...but not Limp Bizkit.  I mean, some of the songs on the 1st album were almost bearable, and &quot;Nookie&quot; was, uh... catchy, I guess.  But this?  Painful is the only word to describe it.  &quot;Chocolate Starfish &amp; the Hotdog Flavored Water&quot; is without a doubt, one of the worst albums of 2000, and quite possibly of the last 10 years.  What do pre-pubescent teenage MTV fans see in this garbage?  In the single year between &quot;Significant Other&quot; and &quot;Chocolate Starfish...&quot; it seems that Limp Bizkit has not matured or improved at all.  Fred Durst STILL has one of the most annoying voices in the industry.  Wes Borland STILL plays 2-3 power cords over and over and over.  John Otto STILL sounds like a drum machine.  Sam Rivers and Dj Lethal remain the only semi-talented members of the band.  Well, enough Bizkit Bashing.  How is the actual CD, you ask?  Painful.  The lyrics are probably some of the most idiotic and immature I have heard in my life.  In &quot;My Generation&quot; Fred states that no one &quot;gives a f**k about his generation.&quot; About 79 times.  &quot;Hot Dog&quot; starts out as an f-word fest, but then turns into an all out attack on industrial demi-god Trent Reznor.  It's actually quite humorous, listening to the 4th grade-esque insults of Fred Durst. &quot;I know you wanna f**k me like an animal/ I know I'm your perfect drug...&quot; and it goes on like that. It gets to the point where you wonder if this is just a joke, or Fred's ranting is actually supposed to be taken seriously.  It's kinda that way with every other song on this album.
0440539811|5.0|Warning: Slight plot spoiler ahead. If you don't like knowing the first 1/4 of a book before reading it, skip this.  Hey, didn't I just warn you about this? Go read something else! Fine. Have it your way. After reading this book, you will claim that the movie &quot;Dogma&quot; gives a more accurate representation of God than a sermon at church, even if Dogma came out years after this book. In Illuminatus!, the plot (should you choose to call it such) basically starts with the two best characters in the book, a dolphin and a squirrel, being introduced, and moves on to a police officer (who begins as the narrator, but doesn't stay that way) being called in the middle of the night to investigate a bombing/kidnapping/possible homicide at a small liberal magazine's office in NY. While there, they find some interesting research which was being conducted by the editor. After looking through some research in a possible conspiracy, they decide to 'lay low' and try to keep the FBI and CIA out of it. ...  This bookeventually comes to a climax ..., which is both action packed and hilarious. You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Just read it.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is a Masterpiece. Along with Odelay &amp; Nevermind, this is one of the best albums of the nineties. Mostly quiet slow songs with Radiohead's patteneded three gutiar, bass frum vocal often covered with electronic noises. Here's all the songs: Airbag: One of the few loud, fast ones. Catchy, but a little too long. Paranoid Android: A 3 part, almost 7 minute song with no chorus. Switching from loud to soft and fast to slow, this is one of the best songs. Subterranean Homesick Alien: Fast, quiet song about how [lead singer] Thom Yorke wishes he'd get abducted by aliens. Exit Music: Probably my least favorite song. Very slow and quiet with lots of wierd noises. Let Down: Not bad. Upbeat, but kind of depressing. Karma Police: Very good song. Mid-tempo and not too loud nor soft, this another one of the best. Fitter Happier: The first of two songs that are really wierd. At first it seams just like a robot talking, but listen again. Electioneering: Another fast, loud one. Very good and catchy. Climbing Up The Walls: Disturbing. The second wierd one, though still not bad. No Suprises: Good. Quiet and mid-tempo, this is Thom's helpless, almost suicidal, cry for normality. Over all, this album needs to grow on you, so listen to it more than once! (Sorry about the last two, I'm running out of room!)
068484267X|5.0|Charles Dickens once said, &quot;In the little world in which children have their existence, whoever brings them up, there is nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt, as injustice. It may be only a small injustice the child can be exposed to; but the child is small; and its world is small.&quot; Angela's Ashes amounts to a brilliant recollection of childhood injustice which is indeed... LARGE! As I read the book, I was appalled at the depth of poverty that Frank McCourt and his family endured, and yet, I can't count the number of times I actually laughed out loud at the &quot;way&quot; in which the story is told. I've never read anything so simultaneously light and weighty. McCourt is witty, and is always in character, and that character is the child who was an eye-witness to every event. (An intriguing, fiercely narrative writing style is consistent throughout the book. ie., there are never any quotation marks).<br />The story is a powerfully moving disclosure of the perils of alcoholism. If it wasn't for the fact that Frank's father could not walk PAST a pub, the family would not have been so destitute. What little money Malachy McCourt earns is forever spent on alcohol, and the amazing thing is that it is spent shamelessly. Mother and children practically starve while dad staggers home in a drunken stupor night after night. Frank says of his father's false promises... &quot;He'll give us a nickel for ice cream if we promise to die for Ireland and we promise but we never get the nickel.&quot;  Injustice.<br />In my opinion, the redeeming majesty of this memoir is that through it we learn a wondrous fact... that shamelessness, irresponsibility, and stupidity do not necessarily have to be handed down to the next generation. Frank broke the mold, and chose self-awareness as his aspiration. I believe that the crucial turning point in his life came when, at the age of eleven he was convalescing at a hospital and came to the conclusion that &quot;it's lovely to know the world can't interfere with the inside of your head.&quot; As readers of Angela's Ashes, we become the grateful recipients of this precocious revelation.<br />Mr. McCourt has received much recognition for his book, and all of it is deserved. I have no idea what he has gained monetarily from its publication, but somehow I think it's a bit more than his aforesaid promised nickel. Way to go. You are an inspiration to the world.know the world can't interfere with the inside of your head.&quot; As readers of Angela's Ashes, we become the grateful recipients of this precocious revelation.<br />Mr. McCourt has received much recognition for his book, and all of it is deserved.

0060931736|1.0|I am another person forced to read this book by my English teacher Mr Cook and the corrupt education system. I thought this book was awful and boring it has to be one of the worst books I have ever read (which isnt many). I also think what Miss Brodie did was a disgrace and puts alot of Mis-trust is teachers and the education system in general. If my parents thought these activities were going on in my school (Marr College) i would be amediatly withdrawn from it, so i think Sandy was right to betray Miss Brodie.
630469878X|3.0|My girlfriend and I watched the film for the first time last night, and our response was &quot;what's all the fuss about?&quot; It never drew me in; it always just seemed like a bunch of Hollywood types playing caricatures of white trash, with many absurd plot twists along the way. Harvey Keitel's attempt at a southern accent was particularly embarrassing. The annoying soundtrack, which sounded like some Don Henley B side, was particularly annoying and obtrusive. Brad Pitt's performance was the best thing in this film. Overall a waste of talent.
1558908374|3.0|Yes, Glenn Close is perfect as Cruella De Vil. And, yeah, it's neat to see a small army of puppies roaming the screen. But that's probably not enough for most audience members, and it wasn't enough for me: The live-action &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; substitutes slapstick for heart, plot and ... well, everything. I don't doubt that small children will get a kick out of bicycles crashing into ponds, dogs biting people on the rear end, dogs urinating on floors and people getting an electric fence to the crotch. But adults will almost certainly notice that they haven't gotten anything in the way of more sophisticated jokes, plots or fully developed characters to entertain them.<br />This is a rental, except for families with young, slapstick-loving children. I suggest parents have a book nearby for &quot;family movie time,&quot; though.
B00004XOWM|3.0|come on I mean damn, this band was really good at one time.  It's not even called Limp Bizkit anymore, it's the Fred Durst band because he does everything on the album.  It just makes me mad that this band went from totally rocking on their first album to be doing hardcore rap on this album.  The new album is ok but not worth buying, maybe getting as a gift.

0898451299|5.0|When I was a child my brother and I loved this book so much that it literally fell apart. I have been searching since my daughter was born for an unabridged copy of the book. Some of the sections that I loved as a child have been removed. My child is now 7 and I'm still looking.. I specifically remember the in depth descriptions of different proceses and jobs that were very easy to understand. I wish an unabridged printing with library binding would be made available...it would be a sell out!
0446677450|2.0|The author takes nearly 200 pages to say what could've been said in one four page article.  The book repeats itself over and over and over -- especially with regard to simplistic concepts that don't need to be hammered home.  To add insult to injury, he glosses over the meaty, more substantial aspects of his treatise. He has some worthwhile views and precepts, but he is a poor writer and desperately needs an editor. Try to buy this book used or borrow somebody's copy -- a &quot;rich dad&quot; would never waste the money on such an item!

B00003CXFG|4.0|Pitch Black starts out with a pretty standard SF plot - space ship is pulled off course by a meteor shower, crashes on a seemingly deserted planet and the survivors discover that they are not alone.  Familar territory to many SF/horror movies.<br />However, Pitch Black is original enough it's telling of the story to stay interesting.  First of all, the bleach process used to process the actual film gives the movie and interesting &quot;look&quot;;    transforming the stale, lifeless desert and low budget sets into much more visually appealing scenes.<br />Secondly, because the film does not appear to be large budget, it  capitalizes on the few effects it does have to build a sense of tension and expectation with the viewer.  This is far more involving and entertaining than straight out computer generated gore.<br />Finally, the performance of Vin Diesel as the tough anti hero is fantastic.  Credit should go to the producers for casting him in this role and to him for making it work so well.<br />The DVD extras are not particularly interesting.  The commentaries are good, but generally more interesting if you are a film student.  The &quot;underground&quot; videos of the rave/launch party for the video are poorly produced are not particularly exciting.  And to be honest, I couldn't spot the three extra minutes in the unrated version.<br />Overall, the DVD makes a good rental.  I am not sure that I would buy it to watch it more than once or for the DVD extras.
B00001OH82|4.0|OK, up front: I was a big Bowie nut, so this album was bound to find sympathetic ears on either side of my head. It did, and I listened to this album a lot. At the time it got bunked badly in the press, and generally got a really bad rap. Here's why:<br />It's 1989: The whole world, not without justfication, is on a Bowie downer following the release of the sell-out Let's Dance followed by a couple of surreal, faux-theatric lemons in quick succession. Everyone's saying, hey, Bowie, cut out this rubbish; just get a band of guys together and play some real rock and roll, like the old days. Ignoring the fact that that's not what the old days were like (well, when did Bowie ever play straight, stripped back rock'n'roll with a bunch of guys?) that's exactly what he did in Tin Machine. No enormous glass spiders; no heavily made up screaming lord byrons here - just good, honest rock'n'roll.<br />And he got crucified, critically and commercially, for it. Thanks, Joe Public!<br />The record is certainly not perfect, and it's not hard to see how it failed to win over a skeptical public. And it didn't really help itself by being half an hour too long, and unfathomably indulgent in a musical sense: far too many of the songs devolve into unstructured - and untalented - jams, a product of Bowie deliberately shunning the spotlight in a futile attempt to prove this really was a band he just happened to be in. Correctly, no-one believed this at the time, and not even Bowie has tried to pretend it since.<br />Now maybe Bowie really did rate Reeves Gabrel as a virtuoso guitar player (he kept him for the best part of a decade after Tin Machine folded), but to my mind Gabrels was allowed far too much lattitude in this band: where the album goes off the rails is whenever Bowie stops singing and Gabrels commences his industrial strength caterwauling on lead guitar. Gabrels is certainly adept at creating disconcerting noises, but it adds only white noise to the product, and probably led to the album being mis-sold as heavy metal, which it isn't, thus meaning neither metal fans nor the general public would buy it. Which is a pity, and left it in the sale racks to the army of Bowie-nuts.<br />Thing is, when the songs are good, they're fantastic. Shorn of thirty minutes of dud songs and instrumental indulgence this would be a truly terrific record; on here there are some songs as good as Bowie ever has produced: imagine a single album with Heaven's in Here, Prisoner of Love, I Can't Read, Under The God, Amazing, Bus Stop, Run and Baby Can Dance, together with the storming 4/4 take on Lennon's Working Class Hero, and you have as good a Bowie album as I can think of.<br />Anyway, that's not how it was sold, and this turned out not to be the commercial return everyone hoped. But for the party faithful, it was a very good sign that normal service (if &quot;normal&quot; is a word you could ever apply to David Bowie) would be resumed shortly.to the album being mis-sold as heavy metal, which it isn't, thus meaning neither metal fans nor the general public would buy it.

B000003TA4|5.0|Only 1 band ever is better to Nirvana. That of course is the Beatles. but other then the beatles Nirvana is the greatest. Every single song on nevermind is a hit. EVERY-SINGLE-SONG. There is not one bad one. That is amazing. Nevermind has a good chance at being the best CD ever. Smells Like Teen Spirit was the song of the 90s with out a doubt. No band can touch Nirvana now a days. (exept the Red Hot Chili Peppers)You will not find a better Cd than this one for years if not ever.

0441172717|5.0|Ok, so my first review was childish and inane, spare me the criticism . . .  Take 2:<br />   Dune is by far one of the greatest works of modern Science Fiction, creating such a vibrant, invigorating, and awwe-inspiring picture, despite the the fact that it's most important planet, Arrakis, (Dune) is as wasted and barren as any imagineable.  However, that one planet is the source of the spice, melange, which gives both life and knowledge; yet, at the same time, it enslaves it's user, and binds them to Dune forever.<BR>   <BR>The main character is Paul Atredies, called Maud'Dib by the Fremen, the only people who live out in the desert of Arrakis.  The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen conspires against him and his family and defeats them upon their arrival at Arrakis, killing Paul's father, Duke Leto Atredies, in the process.  Paul and his mother, the Lady Jessica, escape to the Fremen and live among them. And they welcome him as one who may yet be the Lisan Al-Gaib, the Voice of the Other Void, who will lead them to freedom and make a paradise of Dune. Paul grows to become the greatest of them, their finest warrior, bravest raider, and most cunning tactician, and he plots his revenge against the Harkonnens, and against the Padishah Emperor himself.<BR>   <BR>This book, to put it bluntly, owns.  It is my second favorite work in Science Fiction,(the first being Dan Simmon's Hyperion) with a tremendous plot filled with enough twists and turns to keep any sane person happy.  The characters are dynamic and believable, except for Paul, he sacrifices some believability because of the sheer power of his persona, his prescience, and his deadliness as a fighter.  But he is more than human, and maybe shows a promise of what humanity can be.  Who knows?  In closing, this vision into the future is one that I am glad Frank Herbert shared, and should be read by as many as possible.<br />If you want to find other great books by him, read The Jesus Incident, or The Dosadi Experiment.  But youwill probably have a hard time finding them, I did.

B00000IAU3|5.0|I have long been a Sade fan and was lost because she did not put out anything for a while.  She was the only person I would buy a cd of without listening to more than one release. I heard Dido on Eminema album and love her ever since. I must have went to 5 different store's before i was able to find out who sang the chorus. I finally got word from a friend and bought the cd with only have listened to her on eminem's album. I have never been so pleasantly surprised by buying something completely on a whim. she shows a great range and can easily be compared with sarah mclaughlin and jewel and even enya. you should definitely buy this cd.  it even has hints of r&amp;b in some of its songs. my favorite track is &quot;honestly ok.&quot; you won't be disappointed.
B000005HN6|5.0|when i bought this album i chose it because i liked the name and the cover, and when i listened to it, i discovered how lucky i was, because what was entering through my ears was some if the best music from one of the best metal bands that i have ever known. this cd is melancholic and beautiful, i will always keep it close to my heart.
B00000AOUD|5.0|Thick As A Brick is quite possibly the best concept album of all time. Never again will any album manipulate both uplifting acoustic melodies and screaming electric rock into such an awe-inspiring progressive rock masterpiece. The lyrics, though too complex to fully appreciate after just the first listening, actually add to the magic of the album as they urge the listener to embrace childhood ambitions and fight the pull of the path most often traveled. Contrary to popular belief, Thick As A Brick is not a forty-three minute long song but rather a seamless blend of many unique elements that never grow old or repetitive. Thick As A Brick is the work of master musicians, and Jethro Tull deserves the utmost praise.

E.T. is shown by Spielberg as a wonderful character who learns about life on Earth! Just by looking at him, you can find all the qualities that could ever find in such a wonderful friend!

B00004Y7SF|3.0|Much as I really adore Christina Aguilera's startling vocal abilities, I have to comment that this christmas album of hers doesn't cut it as one to instil holiday spirit.<br />Her voice, indeed, is greater than ever. She sings with better control and  more elaborate stylisations - but at times she overdoes it, gorging an entire track with the maximum amount of her vocal callisthenics possible. Jazz appears to be Aguilera's best platform for displaying that talent of hers to best effect - hear &quot;Merry Xmas Baby&quot;.<br />However, amid the impressive melismatic curls, where is the tenderness in her music, voice? The uptempo tracks are best guilty of the latter flaw - Arresting in the audio makeup, but nevertheless overproduced and devoid of the simplicity best rendered in christmas songs.  (Track 11, &quot;Christina's Xmas&quot;, a meaningless, hip hop interlude that does no good to the album at all.)<br />This 11-track album will be remembered for the vocal showmanship, but for the holiday spirit, there are better CDs out there.
B000002HPT|5.0|This is one of those bands that people really only hear about by word of mouth, but once you start listening to them (and especially if you start with this album!) you'll always be a fan.  Their lyrics are poetic and their images are amazing--you can get a million meanings out of each song, but still feel the simple emotions of the music.  This album is  a great blend of soft and hard rock and it contains all of their best as far as I'm concerned.  Definately a great deal if you wanna sit back and enjoy some real rock in the classic tradition, but with a definate twist!
B00004ZAV3|4.0|I can only hope this will be followed by &quot;The Beatles 2&quot;. There's such great stuff here, but inexplicably, some of the group's biggest and best-remembered songs aren't included. I like &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, but to choose it over &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; is very odd. There's nothing here from The White Album at all, not even classics like &quot;Ob La Di, Ob La Da&quot; or &quot;Revolution&quot;. Nor is there anything from Sgt. Pepper...I would've at least expected &quot;With A Little Help From My Friends&quot;. And, strangest of all, &quot;In My Life&quot; isn't included...and it was just selected as the best song of all time in a huge British poll!
B000050HTO|4.0|To me, this is just a shameless offering from Sony to capitalize on the holiday gift-giving season.  It's 'essentially' an abridged version of the 'essential' package called &quot;Biograph&quot; from a decade ago.  That was a 3CD package put out early in the &quot;boxed set&quot; phenomenon, for the casual fan, of which I count myself. So if you are a youngster and new to Bob Dylan, or you're looking for a Xmas gift for your younger brother or sister, look no further...
B000002BUY|5.0|I got into incubus when make yourself came out. When I began to listen to sciene, it did sound really good. It seems to be a great mixture of different styles of music like hard rock, rap, electronic and I guess a litte funk on a few songs. Songs like redifine, certain shade of green, and favorite things really stick out and make you want more. I certainly hope more people who became interested in incubus through make yourself actually go throught the trouble of buying or borrowing science to see what icubus sounded like before they began to make it big, though make yourself and science do sound pretty different. Most will like. Science is also great because it does mix rap and hard rock in a way that you do not really here that much. I mean there is rap/metal stuff like rage against the machine, deftones and papa rouch but science mixes the two genres completely differently.

I really think that if more people just listened to this album through they really wound less to dislike about it. The album does flow from one song to another song really. Songs like strange currencies and I don't sleep I dream are really well written.

And thats what I did for 3 days. Each page was so brilliant. It was amasing watching the characters develop, watchig lyra mature and Will learn. When something happened to them it felt like it happened to you. With most sequals they get worse, if anything his got better. I treasured every second I spent reading it. Anyone who likes reading will love this book.
6304466498|1.0|\\"Spaceballs\\", a parody of the space adventure genre, is one of the worst of the bunch. A synopsis of the film's plot is not necessary: Suffice it to say that the viewer is inundated with jokes -- one coming roughly every 20 seconds -- made at the expense of &quot;Alien,&quot; the &quot;Star Trek&quot; movies and the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, with the latter taking the brunt of the attack. Thrown in for seasoning, as well, are jokes about sequels and movie merchandising -- \\"Spaceballs\\" dolls, \\"Spaceballs\\" breakfast cereal, and, of course, the \\"Spaceballs\\" flame thrower -- which Brooks sees as having been a side effect of Hollywood's space program. What you're conscious of throughout this movie is that you're sitting in your seat, not laughing at performers who desperately want you to laugh. Rick Moranis has a few good moments mugging to the camera as the Darth Vader character, Dark Helmut. The director himself plays two characters, the shorter of which is a greenish, gnomish, Yiddish little sage called Yogurt. Yogurt's catch phrase, and the movie's, is &quot;May the Schwartz be with you.&quot; And for this you hire writers?   In his other role, of President Skroob, leader of \\"Spaceballs\\", the planet, Brooks has a couple of almost-passable scenes, like the one in which he tries, with disastrous results, to have himself beamed up -- &quot;Star Trek&quot;-style -- into the next room. \\"Spaceballs\\" is actually a kind of comic black hole. All in all, the movie is about as funny as having coffee spilled in your lap. Except that there's no burn -- just that slightly embarrassing, uncomfortable, all-wet feeling.
0793518326|5.0|This book is as good as it gets - period. All titles from The Beatles catalog of British &amp; American releases (during the group's career together) are represented. That's the first major plus of the book - you get The Beatles' arrangements of all their covers from Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, etc. They are great fun to play and many Beatles' versions are better-known than the originals. I know of no other source for these arrangements.<br />As mentioned by many other reviewers, you get a pretty heroic stab at scoring all the instruments heard on every song. This admirable attempt gets you on the right track (in the right key signature, etc.), but falls short on detail of all but the simplest (usually from the early years) songs. Clearly The Beatles had extensive use of multiple 4 track machines and eventually 8 tracks as they matured. This book &quot;scores&quot; usually only 5 parts. It would be impossible to score ALL the over-dubs and extremely lengthy to include all instrumentation, notes and George Martin's orchestral arrangements. So, I pick a bone with the authors using the title, &quot;The Complete Scores&quot;. To me, that term means something very specific which is not appropriate for these types of recordings. The Beatles, George Martin and his engineers were awsome craftsmen. The layers of sounds we hear on the finished records are a one-time snapshot of their creative process - often with somewhat muddy results. For example, &quot;I Am The Walrus&quot; does have a guitar part - pretty lost in the mix and not represented in the book. I just don't think it's possible to get the &quot;Complete&quot; details on these recordings.<br />To save space, the authors often have you incorrectly play a single part for each verse repeat. I know this is getting picky, but the building bass line is the counter-melody in &quot;Something&quot; and the dualing guitar fills in &quot;The Ballad of John &amp; Yoko&quot; change as the song builds. Both are important to each song's development and resolution...<br />In fact, if you really really try, you can find little errors in many songs; mis-titled chords here, incorrect licks there. The non-standard guitar tuning referenced in &quot;Rain&quot; I believe is wrong...BUT, pop in a CD and open the book - you'll get an extremely good idea of what to play. By scoring all the main parts, the authors make this book good as gold for aspiring cover bands. <br />It may not really be &quot;The Complete Scores&quot;, but this book is surely a treasure map to some of the finest and most creative recordings in pop music. I love it!
0804106304|5.0|I found Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club extremely easy to relate to because of the fact that mostly every story told by the women had to do with mother daughter relationships and hardships.  Being a daughter myself, I understand how normal it is to be pushed into things because of tradition, as were the four daughters written about.  Like your average American or Chinese family, the daughters fight their mothers every step of the way under the pretense of independence from overpowering father and father figures.<br /> However, this brings to the fact that the book is directed more towards the female audience possibly making it harder for a male to relate as easily and decreasing overall appreciation of the book.  Because a male will, unfortunately, never know the relationship a mother can have with her daughter it is impossible for him to understand this book as I, or any other woman will.  The appreciation is narrowed because it cuts the possible audience in half.<br /> Still, the incentive that the book is easy to follow is because of the extremely well rounded, developed and dynamic characters.  These women that Tan has created are extremely well developed and extraordinarily believable.  Her men characters of the book, however, are vapid, flat, and there merely as supporting characters.  <br /> Every aspect that Amy Tan writes about is vastly easy to relate to that it draws in almost any type of audience, some more than others.  The central idea of generations holding the same cultures and traditions throughout change is often brought about.  Any family or family member will realize that change is hard to deal with, and will most of the time lead to a break in convention.<br /> Adding to this is the idea that each story builds up to the next to create a central idea Tan has set to achieve.  The central idea, initially set by Tan, is accumulated by following the path drawn out by each narrator and each story.  This can also support that she has very little &quot;fluff&quot;, meaning 99% of the text has significance and helps tie together the stories.<br /> In contrast, there was no real resolution, meaning the stories didn't follow a pattern of rising action - climax - falling action, thus not giving the book a final resolution of an overall conflict.  The Joy Luck Club had the same structure throughout, giving way for much repetition.  The structure consisted of sixteen small pieces that were muchly outweighed by the final product.<br />     As said earlier, I believe an adult female reader will probably appreciate and benefit the most by reading this book, yet I would honestly recommend it to anyone who is interested in relating to other family tales and hardships.
0671034065|3.0|Mr. Perfect is the first novel I have read by Linda Howard and I have to agree with one of the other reviewers - 3.5 stars.<br />I found the mystery parts of the book pretty intriguing and suspenseful, but the romance parts, I would have to say were really not that exciting and really not believable in some parts.  The dialogue between Janie and Sam was often times hilarious and I found myself laughing out loud as well.  The concept of \\"The List\\" and the plot around the list was interesting along with the murders occurring because of the publicity generated.  Howard did do a really good job on the interaction of all of the characters and their development.<br />Based on this book, this author is not one in which I would run out and get her next book to read as soon as I could.
0345360338|5.0|Sharon Kay Penman writes historical novels to savor.  The mental picture she draws of each scene is amazing.  I cherish each of the novels I own of hers and look forward to the next.  Falls the Shadow is my favorite of her creations.  I recommend it highly and have hooked many of my friends on her style.  If you like historical fiction about England...  This is an excellent selection.

B0000024UX|5.0|This is by far their greatest album.  Rich in textures and harmonies.  There is sweet simplicity where there needs to be on song like &quot;Song for the Asking&quot;, &quot;So long Frank Lloyd Wright&quot; and  of course, the &quot;Bridge over....&quot;  And then a lot of pure pop get up and go on song like (possibly early beach boys inspired) &quot;Baby Driver&quot;, &quot;cecilia&quot; and &quot;Keep the Customers satisfied&quot;.  I have always enjoyed this album under many different moods and periods of my life.  There is a great balance and Love in this album, and I highly recommend it.
B000002L9J|5.0|Everyone must own this.  The Smiths are unquestionably the best band of all time, and The Queen is Dead is arguably their greatest album.  Morrissey's lyrics will sometimes make you sad, sometimes angry, and sometimes extraordinarily happy; they are life changing.  The music is amazing.  Do not pass this up!  You need it!
B00003CWL6|5.0|I've enjoyed many, many films over the years, but none as much as American Beauty.  Beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, with a story that is as deep as it is relevant -- this film is sheer perfection.  American Beauty deserves all of its accolades -- and perhaps a few more.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|How could any Beatles CD rate anything less than 5 stars? They were simply the best ever! It would be great if the record company would follow-up Beatles 1 with a CD of &quot;B&quot; sides that were great in their own right, songs such as I'll follow the sun, I'm a loser, baby you can drive my car, and your bird can sing, I feel fine, and so on.  I think a CD like that would possibly sell better than the current one with all number 1 hits. It would be a first to get all the great &quot;B&quot; sides on one CD. At any rate, this is a good start for long-time Beatles fans or newcomers. they just don't make music this good any more!
B00003ZA27|4.0|Let's observe things with serenety. I quite agree with Emile Swanepoel, but I do not agree with  Aaron Mayer and Epauld Olivier. These two reviews are comanded by emotion and are nor scrupolous in using depreciative languange. Karl Richter was the first conductor to avoid romantic exagerations in the perfomance of Bach music; later, the swiss conductor Michel Corboz followed the style of Richter in an interesting equilibrium of baroque style and spirituality. Presently we have the the use of period perfomances, most of them sounds beatifully but, with the small numbers os players and singers we feel the absence of spirituality, meditation or religious joy.(I admire Gardiner reading for his vitality in the joyous parts of the B minor Mass).But Herbert von Karajan condudet this Mass in 1974! In that time, there was not in use the period instruments, neither the new scholl of baroque singing, nor the musicology had discovered what we know today. So, Karajan with his typical effort of touching the deep interiorization of the musical works, does the some in this recording of Bach Mass in B minor. The result is a reading that banishs the romantic reading of Klemperer, the perhaps superficial baroque style of the pioneer Richert, but a very concise performance, specially in the faster and extrovert parts of the mass, where Karajan tempos are not slow. However, in the solo singing, I must admit, the tempi could be a little faster, more lighter. The excelent solo singing are not similar to the recent especialzed baroque singing, but in its context, they are beautifull and in acordance with the time of the recording: 26 years ago! I recomend this recordance for colleters wo like to compare the evolution of perfomance styles. More,I find spirituality in this perfomance, without any exagerated affection. At mid-price its a good achievement. Buy it,witout any fear, however conscious that is not a perios perfomance and its an analogue recording from 1974.
0399146253|1.0|Each new book in this series has reached new levels of absurdity. For some reason Kay Scarpetta has become the focus of a new personal vendetta in each of the more recent books (though this is not a story line that is unheard of in the past).       In this newest book, which is a continuation of Black Notice, Kay becomes a murder suspect despite the fact that there is a suspect in custody who has the most ridiculous defense imaginable. But what do I know? After all, aren't all medical examiners local celebrities who are repeatedly attacked in their own homes while solving homicides for the local detectives? And don't all the local police chief's take it into their heads to obsess about and try to discredit said Examiner?  And logically, the local DA would of course seek to file charges against the Medical Examiner for a murder that was clearly commited by someone else. After a while I could barely stand to turn the page as the story became more and more depressing and stupid.      Cornwell's characters are also becoming more and more two dimentional and stereotypical. Marino has fewer good qualities with each book, and Lucy is still sullen and annoying.       I keep hoping that each new book will return to what made the earlier books entertaining, but Cornwell seems determined to put Scarpetta in situations where is appears the whole world is out to get her. There is no way I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|If you don't get it by now, let me restate it for you.  The Beatles are the greatest band the world has ever had the pleasure of hearing.  I grew up on a healthy diet of The Beatles and from this, it has changed my entire outlook on life.  It affects the music I listen to, the clothes I wear and the life I lead.<br />I might only be twenty, but the Beatles' music affects all who hear it.  I have always loved the Beatles and their music is an extreme example of their talent.<br />True, I do have all the songs on other CD's, but I am not going t waste the time burning a CD when I can go out and buy the CD and get a 32-page booklet with it.  Personally, I like having the slip-covers.  <br />This is a CD by the Beatles.  This isn't Manson or  NIN.  This is the Beatles and if you think that they don't affect your life, you are living in a dream world.  All the music we listen to post 1963 has Beatles influence and we can't get around that.  I just bought U2's new CD and let me tell you, U2 is infuenced majorly by the Beatles.<br />It may have been almost 40 years, but the music still holds up and one day I hope that my kids will listen to it as well.  The Beatles are the greatest ever.  There is just one problem, you can't fit it all on one CD.  Abbey Road (forever).
B000002MNL|5.0|I love Vauxhall and I.  &quot;Now My Heart is Full&quot; and &quot;Speedway&quot; stand out as two of Morrissey's best songs ever.  No other singer makes me feel the way he does.  I recommend this album to everyone; it is one of my all-time favorites.  Morrissey has made my life better!
1577311523|5.0|Eckhart tells us that there is a part in each of us that resonates to the truth when it is heard.  I knew he had hit  home when he said that all suffering was caused by the &quot;mental noise&quot; in our heads, our compulsive thinking, most of which is &quot;useless and destructive.&quot;  We function (if you can call it that) in this world totally &quot;lost in thought.&quot;   Because we identify with our thinking we form a belief  about who we are - our little self, our ego.  We are always trying to figure out who we are, because it is always changing.  One minute we are important, the next minute a failure. Our identity is never stable, never secure.  We form our little identities through our jobs, our spouses, our education, our problems. But beyond all the various ways we define our selves, beyond the ego, is the big Self.  The Self  that remembers its unity with God.  The Self whose natural state is peace and bliss.  Beyond the suffering, is life, beautiful, joyous life.<br />Eckhart takes you by simple practices beyond thinking to the Truth of who you are.  It is the clearest, purest spiritual teaching I have ever read.  Now all I need do is release myself, moment my moment, into this eternal state called NOW until there is no other place and no other identity.  And then, I am Home.
B00003CXDG|4.0|I was very disappointed in the first film.  One of the main themes of the MISSION:  IMPOSSIBLE television series was the focus on the team.  That focus was almost completely missing from the first film.  Thankfully, that theme was resurrected in this film.<br />I was so disappointed in the first film that, if not for the fact that John Woo directed this one, I wouldn't have bothered to see it.  John Woo's involvement pushed this movie to heights it wouldn't have achieved otherwise.  The stunts were amazing, the motorcycle chase scene was one of the best I've ever scene, and the fight scene in the end was full of tension and realistically done.  Mr. Woo has taken the action genre to new levels of achievement.  He is THE director to watch these days and you can see his influence in other films.<br />The one shortcoming of this film was bad dialogue.  Not that the film was filled with it, but rather that there were scenes here and there where the characters didn't seem to interact naturally and the dialogue was way too cheesy.  Now, I have no problem with cheesiness when it's intentional (a la Schwarzenegger movies), but it really had no place in this film.  Other than that, this film was a blast to watch.  Decent acting all around, high octane action, and lots of explosions!  A must see for any action junkie.
0440219078|5.0|The Giver is an amazing story.  I would recommend it to all ages, both young and old.  I myself have read it twice now, it was read to me when I was in eighth grade and I reread it as a college freshman.  Both times that I read The Giver I was intrigued by Lowry's vision of the future. As a reader I could easily visualize Jonas's utopian world, as it was decscribed to me through Lowry's eyes.  Lowry deservingly won the Newberry Award for this book.  Her creativity and talent astound me!<br />The Giver is an easy reader.  Lowry uses text that can be understood by all groups.  Although the wording is simple the book still encourages the reader to ponder what the world might be like in the future.  For myself it was the question of whether or not equality is truly attainable and if it would be a worthwhile change in society.  If equality can only be gained by the loss of emotion, color, animals, sunshine etc., is it really what society should be striving to acheive?
1558216847|5.0|I couldn't put it down. The very idea that this is a fabricated story, as one reviewer wrote, is astonishing. The obvious  knowledge the writer has of geography and Russian history is evident. I have spent some time in Russia, and can appreciate the descriptions of the country. And, as he says at the end, there are many more stories of escape out there.

0316777722|5.0|I have heard David Sedaris on PRI's &quot;This American Life&quot; a few times, and was always sad when his autobiographical essays would come to an end. Always the highlight of any show in which they were featured, these hysterical accounts of expatriate living in France, growing up in North Carolina or what have you even forced me to pull my car over one day for fear of laughing myself into an accident.<br />This collection of essays incites the same feelings, though thankfully this time I don't have to fear a collision while I enjoy them.
0671867369|5.0|Having recently read Band of Brothers by Stephen Ambrose I was stunned by the research and character development Mr. Ambrose always is so deft at.  Having also read Citizen Soldiers by Mr. Ambrose I feel that this author certainly has the right to be the premier historian/storyteller of the Second World War.  It was especially amazing to read of the real life events that surely must have inspired, Saving Private Ryan. From the initial paratroop training to Normandy to Bastogne to Germany, we live and breathe with Easy Comapany of the 101st Airborne as they slog and shoot their way across Europe.  If you only read one World War II book, read this one.  You will enjoy it and find it hard to put down.
B00004RFDW|2.0|Something between a documentary and a movie there are serious problems with the plot. Remove Pacino and it is worth very little. This is a pity because the topic is important.
B00004XOWM|4.0|Limp bizkit are defenitely on a higher plateau with this album. But something about it suggests that they are borderline sold out. The red hat and khakis don't do it anymore for fred, and, let's face it, he's not gonna go on about how he's lonely and broke because... Well, he's not. This album focuses on speaking for a generation that they feel they're a part of, and how they should keep on rollin'. With this third album, they sure are, but are they going to last? This one is defenitely one to have, but it's somewhat a test, or perhaps an introduction to new grounds for bizkit.
0812589041|5.0|Not very often does a book come across my path that knocks me off my feet, but Ender's Game sent me into a tailspin.  I have read books of every genre, and scoured the earth for the holy grail of literature, and this book stands out as the elite book.  I cannot get the hauting images of this book out of my mind.  I dare say it's better than the Beatles who are better than Jesus.  Hail to you Orson Scott Card.
B00004ZAV3|2.0|No &quot;White Album&quot; tracks at all. How can they leave out those awesome jams. It's OK, no one can appreciate the &quot;White Album&quot; by listening to single tracks anyway. They left out &quot;Here Comes The Sun&quot; as well..oh well, can't please everyone, so many songs but so little room on disc. All in all, a hideous compilation. A money machine.
B00000K2SC|3.0|Something between Terminator and a video game it has some interesting moments and a lot of unexceptional ones. Just another idea of some filmmaker that found its way to the screen.
B00000DHRX|4.0|As someone who isn't a great fan of George Michael, I was dismayed at the idea of having to pay for a double-disc, best-of compilation in order to have the songs that I like by him.  Having said that, I did discover a lot of songs on the first disc that I really enjoyed.  I was already familiar with &quot;Jesus to a Child&quot;, which is a very elegant composition, although I'm not sure what to make of the analogy of Jesus and one's lover.  There are some other fine, understated compositions here that the general public isn't familiar with.  One other track that I enjoyed was &quot;Desafinado&quot;, which I liked despite being turned off to Brazilian music after Starbucks killed the genre for me.<br />The second disc is hit-and-miss for me.  My favorite song is &quot;Freedom 90&quot;.  It's George Michael's backlash against how they made him into this teenybopper icon.  Instead of being brash, it turns out to be his strongest composition ever.  It also brings to mind the video, which features the supermodels from the early nineties.  I really wish that a picture of that video was included in the sleeve for the second disc.<br />Aside from Freedom 90, not too many of his &quot;upbeat&quot; tracks grab me.<br />That criticism aside, I'm not disappointed with this purchase.
B00001NFCY|4.0|I know it isn't as good as the debut release from Creed, but I love it a lot. My sister says &quot;Scott Stapp is sexy, and the band does pretty good too.&quot;<br />Well, I love the songs like &quot;Are You Ready&quot; and &quot;What If?&quot;, and &quot;Say I.&quot; It is sorta christian, but not completely though. One good thing is, it doesn't have all this cussing in it, and you need to get to that in some bands you listen to. It might not seem original to some of you, but trust me, compared to the average LB losers, this is good, though not a favorite. <br />All I have to say....
157492589X|5.0|The beauty of a miniseries, which can only happen with television, is that you can truly develop a multitude of interesting characters, whereas even the best movie released in a theater is limited by time.  Lonesome Dove had a budget of over $20 million--on par at the time with big Hollywood movies--so the production and settings are excellent, although the picture quality leaves something to be desired.  I think that this is one of the most engaging movies made.  The characters are all so great, each with their own history, faults, personalities, and storylines.  Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall give the best performances and it's hard to think of anyone else playing their roles (although James Gardiner and Jon Voight both play Jone's character in later movies).  This movie is a thorough enjoyment, especially if one already has an interest in the Old West.
0793573742|5.0|...or wanna-be collector like me. The photographs are indescribable... lush, color-saturated but detailed enough to serve as authorative historical documentation of each individual instrument. I didn't realize Iwanade had included so much textual discussion in this book! He provides a glossary of terms frequently encountered in the esoteric world of 58-60 Les Paul sunbursts, as well as high-level information on the science of the finishing process, wood patterns (now I can tell birds-eye maple from blister), and the famous Paul tone as derived from the famous PAF pick-ups. <br />This book is an indispensable tool for the serious collector or the amateur dreamer. All it's missing is a centerfold.
B000002H33|5.0|I am writing this in the hope that fans of no-talent rock bands nowadays such as Blink 182 will realize what they're missing...   Master of The Puppets is the best of rock, new and old.  The eight songs on the album, featuring Master Of the Puppets, blend an amazing mix of vocals, lyrics, and most notably, guitar solos (see Track 2, Master of the Puppets, and disposable Heroes.)  Each song on the album, from Sanitarium to Lepper Messiah, would be a top song on any other album.  Before I began listening to Metallica and Master, I figured the best rock was Offspring.  I was sadly mistaken.   This is music at its best..both on the fronts of instrumentals and lyrics.
B00001QEBQ|5.0|This is definetely a film I'll watch again and again. I'm too old for most Disney movies, but this one is brilliant. It's not just or even mainly for little kids, as it's got a lot of complicated ideas in it which will probably be lost with them. Mulan follows the story of China being invaded by the Huns and a Chinese girl, Mulan, dressing up as a boy and going to war in her father's place because he is too old to fight. This is treason and if she is found out she will be killed.  The film is a mix of humorous, sad and dramatic parts which works really well, and there is barely a dull moment; my list of 'favourite parts' covers almost the whole film, the only part that drags a bit is with the ancestors' spirits, as it just seems to lag a little there, with Mushu the only one being really funny. All the songs are great, the best ones that come to mind are 'Reflection.' and 'The Girl we're Fighting For.' but all the others are good, too. Mulan is a very strong character matched only, I think by Pocahontas in Disney films, but I prefer Mulan. The animation is also  stunning, the scenes at Mulan's house and also in the parade near the end of the film are the best. This is a film I recommend to anyone even if like me you thought you were growing out of Disney films. It beats even my previous favourite,Pocahontas. This film actually lives up to its advertisment as 'a film the whole family can enjoy,' as most Disney films don't.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|After departures,weak offerings and other projects...The Iron Maiden that we know and love ..is back....in fact they are SO back ....it sounds almost like they never left. ....BRAVE NEW WORLD sounds like it could have been made in 1985 between POWERSLAVE and SOMEWHERE IN TIME (slanting towards the better POWERSLAVE).   They didn't make a big deal about this reunited album....it seems like they got in the studio with thinking it was 1985.....same old Maiden....ripping guitars,songs about war and fighting,Steve Harris prominant bass playing. ...The only difference is there is 3 guitarists....COOL...more riffs and some of them look like they aged quite a bit (no big deal).  Same old Maiden!
B000050FEN|2.0|Fincher's a good director, and the film is visually impressive.  It very successfully shocks and upsets the audience.  Problem is, it is totally meaningless, totally devoid of substance.  After the perfectly predictable but nonetheless disturbing finish, you realize that you have allowed yourself to get worked up about nothing at all.<br />The film has plenty of stuff in it that could earn it 3 stars instead of 2, but the net effect of watching the film is negative.  (I have nothing against upsetting films, but if they have no real reason to upset you, I'd rather steer clear.  I was better off before I rented this thing than I am now.)
6302968143|4.0|This is one of my favorite Halloween movies. Do some of the contents pass plausibility? Yes. But, at least they have a legendary background. The interaction between the 3 witches is clever and comical. The images are well done, and the music is entertaining and chilling. One of the best things about this movie is that it offers you a tase of fear, but not so much that it goes from scarey to absurd. The action is well done, and character development is admirable. Fear, suspense, and comedy are mixed with a rare delicacy. Perhaps the best thing about this movie is that the witches' frightening and evil intentions march side by side with their comical confusion about the late 1900s. As scarey movies for Halloween go, this one takes the candy!
B00004YW6I|5.0|P.J. Harvey has done it again.  She never let's me down. This CD is a master work of her genius. I am a major fan of &quot;Is This Desire?&quot; and was sure this one couldn't top that masterpiece. I was wrong. What I want to comment on is this: WHY IS P.J. HARVEY NOT GETTING AIRPLAY?? I live in the metro Detroit area and the only radio station I've heard her played on is NPR.  Come on now! Is it like this in your town also? I can't believe how horrible the current state of radio is in! I mean if it's not teenie pop or rap crap it just doesn't play. P.J. Harvey deserves to be heard. She should be a superstar in the music world.  No one out there today has the voice that P.J. has (Bjork comes very close, but that's an entire other rant. Why isn't she played on the radio in America?). P.J. fans need to speak up now to your local radio stations and make them play her. Demand it. Let them know we want to hear her! And why hasn't Island records pushed the hell out of her?? They've done very little at all. No one I know has heard of her except through me. They should get behind their most talented artist...shouldn't they? Anyway, the CD is excellent. Check it out before it's swept off the charts to make room for the latest teen craze band. If you've never heard of her or her music, buy it anyway. You'll be glad you did. Thanks for listening.

0767903854|5.0|Published under a different name in Australia, Bill Bryson gives an enthusiastic outsiders view of the country I call home. In the process there are a couple of things that get overstated (while it may be true that there are many dangerous things here, Bryson's focus on them borders on paranoia) but on the whole this book is remarkably insightful into aspects of Australian culture. I found myself reading, laughing, and thinking &quot;Why haven't I thought of it in that way?&quot; He pulls out the quirks and the historical oddities so humorously that I almost didn't notice how much research must have gone into preparing the book. Perhaps the best thing is, there is so much more that he could write! Given the obvious love that he has for the country, maybe Bryson will be back to visit again (perhaps in winter, perhaps going to some other places) and write a sequel. If he does I will certainly be reading it.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix sucks you in,turns you around and around until you dont know whats happening and unfortunately when it gets over it spits you out.Whoa.The Matrix is ultimately my favorite movie,Keanu Reeves is at his best playing hacker Neo,who isnt so sure about &quot;reality&quot;.He meets the man that can explain to him what reality is,that man is Morpheus a leader in the real world,he explains to Neo that the world Neo lives in isnt real,but is actually a computer system built to enslave humans(once again,whoa).Now let me explain hopw good this movie is,critics praised it,people praised it,it won over twenty awards world wide.It was nominated for four Academy Awards,and took them all home(they are best visual effects,sound effects,film editing,and sound effects editing,whoa).The Matrix is a movie you have to watch over and over again to undertsand,and it ultimately is a powerhouse of a movie.
0441172717|5.0|Other reviewers seem to have missed the obvious influences on this book. My pointing them out will not make me popular. But a book this good needs to be understood in all its intricacies, if only in outline.<br />Paul Atreides is the last in the line of the ancient Greek king Aggamemnon. (See Children of Dune.) The Book Dune tells of his odyssey. He travels far from his rightful home in the capital city of Arrakeen on Arrakis and ascends to the throne of the known universe with righteous vengeance. Just as Odyessyeus traveled far from his home to retake his throne and family.<br />He is, for all intents and purposes, a Christ-like figure. He is the Kwisatz Haderach, the individual forecasted by the in-bred Bene Gesserits who can see throughout the entire present world. The Bene Gesserits represent a sort of people (I leave it to the reader to determine which) who seek a messiah. Atreides fulfills that role, only to turn against the Order of Witches. Just as certain lamb-like followers assume Jesus turned against the People of the Book.<br />Atreides is not just a Christ-like figure, but also a Hitler-like figure. He instigates a religious war against the known universe with his fremen warriors, once he has ascended to the throne. The comparison is actually drawn in Dune Messiah for all to read. However, just as certain revisors of history deny that Hitler was responsible for the &quot;mere excesses&quot; of his Stormtroopers, so Paul Mua'dib doesn't really know what to do with his fremen zealots.<br />Further implications of the books' fascism are found in their idea of the Gom Jabar. This is a test, wherein the person who undergoes it must prove his or her &quot;humanity&quot; by being not flinching while being tortured. God Emperor of Dune explains this one. It seems that one proves one's humanity by being civilized in an exceptional circumstance, such as being tortured. Anything else is madness and fought violently. Carl Scmitt, a Nazi ideologist would be proud.(See Scmitt's Political Theology.)<br />And then there's the utterly hysterical homophobia in the cycle.<br />Don't get me wrong. I loved these books. Herbert's line at the end of Dune Messiah that Mua'dib lives forever in his suicide is noted and taken to heart. But the ideology and philosophical content (though not their form) of these books are rancid.
B000005IRG|5.0|This is an incredible record. 5+ star material if such a catagory existed. From the first time I heard in in high school, to this day over 15 years later, I am amazed at the sound and originality of television.  It is unfortunate that Verlaine never really did anything beyond this (that approached television quality that is) as I believe he (along with Richard Lloyd) are exceptional talents.  If CD's can be worn out, I will ware this one out.  I honestly think I have played this one more times than any others of the several 100 i have.<br />This record provided an excellent bridge between wanking guitar solos and punk/art rock, something that has VERY seldom been done in such a believable and natural fashion (excepting the other related phenomenon Richard Hell and the Voidoids).  I would suggest that if you are truly interested in music history you should own this.  Ignore the few dissenters who complain about Verlaine's voice, or that the songs are too long or that it isn't as good as Pere Ubu etc...  this is one of the most important rock records to come out of the 70's and will stand the test of time indefinitely.  There is not a weak moment on it. (The vinyl DOES sound better, but what can you do!)  Get it and listen to it several times before thinking about a review...
B00000I9MK|5.0|Maybe it was because this was the first B&amp;S album I bought, but since buying all the others, this is clearly the best one in my opinion. The other albums are good, and certainly grew on me with multiple listens, but this one got me right away. Every song is lovely. Tunes such as &quot;The State I'm In&quot; ,&quot;Expectations&quot;, and &quot;She's Losing It&quot; just stick with you from the beginning with their catchy beat, rich acoustic sound, and darkly humorous lyrics. This is a fun one to sing along to in the car.
0425129586|5.0|Previously titled Ten Little Indians, this book was simply amazing, and also became a popular play.<br />Ten seemingly average people are brought together to the exotic Indian Island. While these seven men and three women seem like your every-day Englishmen, they're each guilty of a dark crime, untouchable by the law. When the ten visitors of Indian Island begin dying, one-by-one, it's decided that the murderer must be one of the ten visitors themselves!<br />It's hard to put down a book like this. One moment, you'll be thinking &quot;oh, it's him, of course,&quot; and the next page, that person is found dead. A fine Agatha Christie to start with, &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; is among her most famous books.<br />&quot;One little indian boy, left all alone, he hanged himself...<br />And Then There Were None.&quot;
B000001E8P|5.0|If aliens came to this planet and wanted to find out what a British person is like, Jarvis Cocker would be the perfect example. His sarcastic lyrics and sly observations on British life and the class divide (\\"My favourite parks are car parks, grass is soemthing you smoke, birds are something you shag\\"), plus his panache and unusual style mark him out as a cult star.<br />His knack for a classic pop song was ably demonstrated here too. Disco 2000 and Common People are great examples of this, both guaranteed to get you singing along whilst also having lyrical depth. Another favourite of mine is the dark and mischievous I-Spy, in which the aforementioned lyric is but one highlight. Check this album out now.
0399146253|1.0|I fall for it every time. I think this one HAS to be better than the last. Once again I was disappointed.
6305095566|4.0|As the Director of Photography for Evil Dead, I was eager to see the latest edition. I was in most ways pleased with the video, but must admit to some disappointment. The listed &quot;original aspect ratio&quot; of 1.33:1, whether Sam himself supervised the transfer or not, is a misnomer. The film was framed for a 1.85:1 theatrical format. Projected, the film has much more impact in a wide version. It is true that the camera gate was not masked as 1.85:1 for the 16mm negative, but it was always concieved as a widescreen film. It was great to see the many pictures and the original footage from Tennessee. Also hearing Bruce Campbell's commentary was fun. All in all, though, a treasure trove I'll share with my kids (when they get older).
B00004XOWN|5.0|this album is so hot. all those other cats that talks bad about this album knows that Limp Bizkit is the most skillful band in this day and age, and Limp Bizkit started something that they can't handle. Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water is of da heeazy.
B00000DGSN|5.0|Well for me, it's either this or Bob Seger's 'Live Bullet'.<br />I was a poor 13-year-old when this first came out.  I'd only recently bought 'Machine Head' (my first serious rock purchase) and the prospect of spending another $5 on much the same set of tunes did not appeal.  I think I ended up spending my money on, and being slightly disappointed by, Focus's 'Moving Waves'.<br />But, as friends demonstrated, this very quickly became the album to have.  If, on a Saturday night you didn't have anywhere to go or any money to spend, you would just sling this on the turntable and revel in your own concert -- until your parents told you to turn the music down.  (I'm sure my amp went up to 12.)<br />This album had a fantastic atmosphere.  Cut loose from the shackles of the studio, it showed what the band could really do.  There are no overdubs here.  Sometimes a guitar solo goes down a path (e.g. on 'Space Trucking'), gets bogged down and needs to be rescued by the rest of the band, but that's all part of the fun.  It is a trememdous noise! In the sleeve notes, Ian Gillan apologises for the quality of his vocals.  I think they are tremendous; I shudder to think what they must have been like on a good night.<br />Live albums tend to benefit less from remastering than studio albums, and this is no exception.  But id does sound better.  And there is a bonus CD containing three extra tracks, including 'Black Night'.

B00003CXBK|4.0|That's right this is my favorite movie ever. I can't get enough of it. I really urge you to see this movie. Anyone who hates this movie or believes it to be hard to understand are mentally shallow. I'm thirteen and viewed this movie when I was eleven. I found nothing shocking or disturbing. I just saw japanese art work at its best! The only reason that i did not give this five stars is because of the whole dubbing, subbing issue.
0812932293|5.0|Now with the caveat that this is Branson's view of how he got to where he is today, I found this book to be a terrific read. In my mind, 'Losing My Virginity' perfectly encapsulates the way a leader is supposed to think and act.<br />Ever heard Branson speak in public?  He's surprisingly shy, ill-at-ease, and not all that eloquent.  But the guy works hard every day at crafting his vision and pushing it forward one day at a time.  That's the genius of this book - Branson shows us the method he's used to succeed and admits that there's no great genius involved, but a heck of a lot of perserverance, determination...and a fair degree of flair!<br />My caveat at the beginning?  If you want a very different viewpoint of Branson's career, check out Tim Jackson's excellent &quot;Virgin King.&quot;
B00003CXFG|5.0|Ok, I know I'm supposed to specifically talk about the DVD, but I saw this movie in the theater and I loved it. The special effects were so artfully done, they cast the perfect mood for the film.  The feeling of dread and suspense hardly ever leave you throughout the movie.  The scripting and fine cast coupled with the special effects really worked well for me. So many Sci-Fi movies suffer from painfully cheesy and cliche'd dialogue and &quot;Pitch Black&quot; says only what it has to.  Great Film!
0780021967|4.0|This special Criterion DVD edition of &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; is good, but not brilliant. It's lacking a bit in sharpness, but it's still without a doubt the best looking transfer out there, and until we see a better one it will have to do.
B00004W5UA|5.0|The Fight Club came on at our movie six plazza and I did not go see it because I knew nothing about it. I looked at it in a video store and rented it. I have never seen such a good action movie. A quote in there is We dont talk about Fight Club, and I want you to hit me as hard as you can. There is a sleezy lady in there named Marla that smokes all time etc. A man named Tyler started the club in a delaped building in the basement. They go to sleezy bars, weird music, weird hairdos, constant fighting and explixt language, gore, beating each other till they bleed, graphic violance. I loved the movie so that I would not wait till it went down to buy it. Last night I picked out me a bed time movie and I picked it because I have not seen several months. I set my sleep timer for three hours. I loved every minute of it. I dozed off later and when I woke up the next morning our area was have rain, thunder storm. The v.c.r. was rewound so I fast fordward the tape to where I left off before going to sleep and loved it. If you love gore and horror this movie is just for you. If you have not it and you go to your local video and they are all rented out some more movies you may like are: Summer of Sam, Boys Dont Cry, End of Days, Stigmata.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I think I was a little too old for this movie when it originally came out.  As a teen I thought it was a kid flick.  In my 20s me and my 10 year old nephew rented it and laughed our heads off (especially the scenes with the creatures tossing body parts around).  Now I'm in my 30s and it is the best DVD I own.  The DVD really shows the colors well.  Love the sky, the distant shots of the maze, and Jennifer shows up nicely too near the beginning.  I first saw Connelly in Once Upon A Time In America.  Lovely actress.  Check her out in Dark City too.  As far as the sound, it is better than you can imagine.  Bowie's songs will have you singing along even if you don't want to.  The detail is startling.  Henson's team works magic!  The attention to detail on each creature is amazing.  And it all comes out clearer than ever before thanks to DVD!  As far as extras I didn't need them.  However, the expected trailer, talent files and unexpected &quot;making of&quot; documentary are nice to have.  Henson fans should have this on your shelf.
0446677450|5.0|My son brought home a copy of &quot;Rich Dad Poor Dad&quot; in August, 2000 as a recommendation from his sales manager where he was working as a salesman to earn money for college. The simplicity of the examples in the book blew me away. I have never read a financial book that made so much sense. The concepts were so clear and I totally agree with them. I just wish I could have read it 40 years ago so I wouldn't have had to learn the hard way.<br />I do agree with other reviewers that this book will probably not win any prizes for writing style, but the information is priceless. At 62 I have lived long enough to see the problems people can get into that these concepts can go a long way toward changing. The number one cause of divorce in the US is financial problems. Do yourself a favor, read the book and stay happily married.
0440214041|5.0|Fresh after finishing 'The Firm' I had my wife pick up a copy of 'The Pelican Brief' and began to devour it as quickly as I could. It didn't take long to be captured by the character of Darby and her innocent way of life.  We find out that quite by accident, Darby writes a 'brief' that quickly catches the attention of someone--WHO exactly that 'someone' is, well it takes a while to find that one out.  It also takes a little while to figure out exactly what is IN the 'brief' to begin with.  Now I am NOT a lawyer and it was a little high on techno-babble from a legal standpoint, but basically Darby makes a total assumption about some land in Louisiana, and it turns out to be right on the money: a plausible explanation of the deaths of two members of the Supreme Court.  More than plausible, she is 100% right, which is when she get's the attention of those who would rather see the author of this mysterious 'brief' silenced.  Darby is suddenly on the run, wondering whether or not her next move will be her last.  Paranoid and terrified beyond words, Darby makes a desperate move and contacts a Washington Post reporter in hopes of convincing him of her story.  It takes some doing, but he eventually comes around to her side, and this is where life becomes really interesting for Darby and her journalist friend. I have to say one thing about the movie version, Julia Roberts really WAS THE perfect choice to play Darby.  Other than that, don't bother with the movie (as usual), go straight to the bookstore and grab a copy of 'The Pelican Brief' and sit back and enjoy.  Another winner from Grisham.

0684853523|5.0|This is a terrific book, for at least two reasons: King allows his reader to accompany him on a personal, albeit highly selective journey through King's life thus far; also, in the second part of the book, King demonstrates extraordinary generosity when sharing his reflections on the craft of writing. Over the years, I have observed him carefully during various interviews during which he revealed a delicious (often self-deprecating) sense of humor in combination with absolute seriousness about what effective writing involves, indeed requires. To the best of my knowledge, in this book for the first time King assembles and examines in great detail most (if not all) of his thoughts and feelings about himself both as a person and as a writer. I share his high regard for Strunk and White's The Elements of Style. Perhaps he shares my high regard for Zinsser's On Writing. King's own On Writing would be a perfect holiday gift for anyone, for a younger person especially, who has already demonstrated some talent as a writer and is serious about improving the skills of craftsmanship. This is also a book anyone will read with pleasure, perhaps with joy. That was my own experience.<br />One final point: King leaves no doubt about the enormous difficulties of writing well. I am reminded of Rod Steiger's response whenever aspiring young actors request his advice. He asks them if they want to be an actor or if they have to be an actor. \\"The longer it takes for them to answer that question, the less likely it is that they will succeed.\\" Hemingway once explained that he wrote because he had to \\"get it out.\\" Those who have to write will write. King's book can help them to write better. For everyone else, King's book can help them to read with greater awareness as well as appreciation of those who write well. And all will get to know this best-selling author in the process.
0671042858|3.0|Let me say this before I begin my review of this book. (Actually there are two things I'm going to say.)<br />(1) It has been a few months since I've read this, so I may not remember it all.<br />(2) It was the first Stephen King novel I have read.<br />Okay, if you read that, you should be set for this particular review. And in that case, I'll start from the bottom and work my way up: if you didn't skip it, you found out that this was the first Stephen King book I've read. (However, since that time I've read many more....luckily.) This isn't the best he's ever done; I was expecting that, just something to keep me reading his work. The book got annoying at times. From what I remember, he mentioned bugs around her head at least 50 times...that got me a little annoyed at times. Plus, with one character wandering around the woods, there isn't much to talk to...you'll soon find that trees listen, but are quite quiet. So Trisha doesn't do a whole lot of talking, just walking...and falling.<br />The book takes place in Maine, as most would expect. Considering he lives in Maine, it's proper for him to write about it. I don't mind a bit. But getting back to the point, a young girl, Trisha, wanders off in the woods while on a hike with her brother and mother. They're arguing abot something. (I think their father(?)) So instead of listening, she falls behind, but soon finds them out of sight. When she tries to cut through an unmarked path, she finds herself lost and alone...for the rest of the book, pretty much.<br />While on her adventure she'd rather not be on, she listens to her radio, mainly the Boston Red Sox to hear them talk about her favorite player, Tom Gordon. She pretends that he is with her for protection, and basically he is the only thing she talks to throughout the book. I was surprised when the villian arrived...I just assumed it was the forest, but there was a spirit that showed up a bit late. (Maybe it got lost too.) It was described as having a head of a beehive. However, with its late arrival, I wasn't too impressed.<br />I don't know what to really say about this book. Normally I find writing reviews incredibly easy, but this seems kind of tough. There isn't a whole lot to write...honestly. The book pretty slow, unlike some of his other books. I got bored of her always being in the woods, and wished that she would reach some sort of civilization before I starting going a little crazy with her. But she didn't...at least it was a short book. Personally I think the best part was when she bit off the head of a live fish, and reading that part made me realize that King was a pretty good writer despite this quite boring piece of work.<br />This review may not be helpful for you. If I was reading it, I wouldn't get much out of it other than the guy didn't like the book. That's what I'm stating...I didn't enjoy it. It was boring and slow, and I tended to let my mind wander off. However, I read another book of his, loved it, then read another...I now find myself thinking, &quot;Hey, everybody isn't perfect! Even Spielberg made Nineteen Forty-One!&quot;<br />If thinking that you never heard of that movie, don't feel embarrassed. It wasn't good despite hits like Saving Private Ryan and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, not to mention many others. So even if King has a bad day, give him some slack.

B00003CXFG|5.0|I think there may be confusion regarding the footage in the Unrated Director's Cut of this film.  I was confused when I first saw this particular DVD.  Watching it straight through again at home, I didn't notice anything different about the unrated version and the version I had seen in the theaters a while back.  So, I watched it with the commentary track (Vin Diesel, David Twohy).  Supposedly, a few scenes had not made it into the theatrical release, but I could have sworn that everything on the unrated version DVD was in the theatrical version as well.  <br />My recommendation is that if anyone is trying to decide which version to buy on DVD, get the unrated version.  I say this because on the commentary track, director David Twohy mentions which scenes were supposedly not in the theatrical release.  My feeling is that without those scenes, the character development would suffer a bit, as well as the overall pace of the film.  <br />Besides that, the quality of the DVD is very good.  Picture and sound are nearly perfect, and there are plenty of special features.  <br />Many people didn't like this movie, but I am not one of them.  If you liked it, I would definitely recommend getting the DVD.  And get the unrated version.
B000002U8G|5.0|Meddle is probably Pink Floyd's most diverse album. The songs are: (1) One of These Days - this is a heavy metalish instrumental. It doesn't sound dated at all, and would do Metallica credit. 5 stars. (2) A Pillow of Winds - this is an airy, folksy song. It's very calming and peaceful. 4 stars. (3) Fearless - this is another light, folksy song. I personally don't like it that much, and I don't think the interpolation of You'll Never Walk Alone is done that well. 3 stars. (4) San Tropez - this is a jazzy song. In my opinion, it's the weakest on the cd. Even so, it's still pretty good. 3 stars. (5) Seamus - a short, bluesy song. If you look at this as a serious song, it's horrible. However, if you look at it as meant to be amusing, it's not that bad. 4 stars. (6) Echoes - this is my favorite Pink Floyd song. It's 23 minutes long, but it doesn't get old. Every time you listen to this song you hear something new. At least 5 stars. All in all, this album has several very good songs and is well worth buying.

0679777547|4.0|I read this book, having seen the movie &quot;Ninth Gate&quot;.  While the book is much better, and more enjoyable, I admit the experience gave me a good visual on the setting and some of the characters.<br />Perez-Reverte's writing is often compared to Eco, but I personally prefer it more.  Some say it is a &quot;popular&quot; imitation of Eco, but I think those opinions do not do Perez-Reverte justice.  His writing flows, and is pleasant, compared to Eco's heavy, dense writing which seems to beat you over the head with details from topics flying all over the place.<br />The &quot;Popular&quot; setting, of Dumas' &quot;Musketeers&quot; and references to Agatha Christy, Maurice LeBlanc, and of course, Sir Conan Doyle makes for a fun read, with a very real feeling while invoking the devil and fallen angels and the occult.<br />If you like any of the above mysteries, or enjoy reading about fallen angels, or just enjoy reading a well written book, this is  a great one to pick up.
B00000JHAU|2.0|This record isn't really bad, but it's very bland. The songs melt into one another, there are no highs or lows, no peaks. You can play this when your parents come over for dinner and they will think that you've become &quot;nice&quot;. Tigermilk was far better, a real masterpiece of pop. Also, I'm surprised that nobody has commented on this bands blatant ripp-off of the Smith's record covers.
0140288503|5.0|I don't usually read documentaries, but picked this book up on a friend's recommendation.  And it was worth it.<br />The author reconstructs, from words of U.S. soldiers, those opposing the U.S. soldiers, and transcripts, the horrific mission which went literally to hell.  In the honest telling of a story in which most of us would shiver to imagine ourselves, I read about the fears, the deaths, the comeraderie, and courage of the soldiers who found themselves stranded and at the center of a unbelievable gunfight.  <br />It is not a book that exhalts the United States, or even warfare.  It is not a book that aims to glorify the bloody, cruel, and inhumane act of war.  It depicts the soldiers in fear, being shot at, crying and screaming, and struggling just to stay alive.  It depicts clashes among the ranks, and pride getting in the way of the mission.  Yet, in the end, it is the luck and pluck of these ordinary men giving their lives for their country which remain with you, regardless of what the Governments and Military intended or forced upon them.<br />It is no wonder, that once the book came out, it has become a required reading in the military itself.  Even though it brings out its own dirty laundry, you cannot help but to bow your head in respect for their courage and service.<br />dulce et decorum est pro patria mori<br />I don't support military actions, I don't support warfare (though I admit it seems to be in human nature), I don't support the U.S. &quot;intervention&quot;, I don't support massacres of people in the name of security - But I respect these men, and what they did.  The author wrote the book saying the men &quot;deserve to be remembered&quot; and it does a great job.
B00003CXDF|3.0|If you like fast cars, explosions, automatic weapons fire this is the film for you.  There is a plot and it is interesting but the action in this film is the focus.  Pretty violent for my tastes but not umbearable.
0399146253|2.0|I have read all of the Cornwell as well, and can agree that this installment is not up to par at all.  I'm not sure what went wrong.  I think she tried to pull too many previous plots together, but it appeared strained, and yet she left other plots in the book dangling.  I think she also meant this to be a more introspective edition - more of Scarpetta's thoughts and emotions.  It comes off tedious and self absorbed.  The entire middle 100 pages is way too slow, but if you're interested in police interrogation, you might find it interesting.  I did not.<br />I hope she gets back to some good action. If you're a fan, you'll probably want to read it to catch up on some tidbits, but if you've never read Cornwell, start with POstmortem, and NOT this one!
B0000026NC|5.0|this is an awsome cd. I am not sure why there are so many bad reviews, but i guess people have different tastes! I would definilty recommend this cd.
630218021X|4.0|As you plunge headlong into ANY Ken Russell film, know this: It's strictly a &quot;love 'em or hate 'em&quot; scenario. If you already hate Ken Russell's, shall we say-- unique aesthetic, you'll find this movie repulsive, offensive and unredeemable. However, if you are open to Russell's cinematic approach, you will find this film at turns outrageously hilarious, exhilarating and quite the sensual feast. &quot;The Music Lovers&quot; is one of Russell's most visually beautiful efforts, at times recalling Stanley Kubrick's painterly &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;. There is nothing as genteel about the script or characterizations, however! Richard Chamberlain and Glenda Jackson both give their most fearless performances portraying the &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot; of the classical composer era. Not only does Russell make history &quot;come alive&quot;, he reaches out of the screen and gives you a Three Stooges eye poke with his baton for good measure! Jolly good fun for open minds, classical music snobs need not apply.
630281474X|5.0|I have seen this movie over a thousand times during my short eighteen years on this planet, not because my real life surname is in league with one of the characters, but because of the way Stokers two great nemesis always kept one step ahead of the other. I saw the (31) version and believe me it was the most boring one I've seen-next to jack palances performance! here terance fisher chose the right actor to play the most evil, ruthless, monster the world had ever came across. Christopher Lee is far better than Loguse, Langella, Oldman and Palance put together. I found him so scary that I had night mares for over two weeks, it was the pure evil in his eyes that convinced me that he was perfect for the role! I guess There is also one Professor VanHelsing on the screens, and Yes it has to be Peter Cushing! I've watched him in all the Dracula movies and I will most certainly have him in my family to protect against the evil that is Dracula! Both the character of Dracula and VanHelsing are perfectly portraid by Lee and Cushing. They are like Holmes, versus Moriarty and like those two nemesis Lees Dracula is a Formidable apponant for Cushings Vanhelsing! I just now rediscovered Horror of Dracula and Ladies and Gentle- men, I will never get tired of it..I loved it and still do!!
B000002J1U|4.0|This album has lots of good acoustic music, with tracks like Gallows Pole, Tangerine, That's The Way, and Bron-y-Aur Stomp.  This is the album which produced the hit song &quot;Immigrant Song&quot;, which reached its peak at #16 on the Billboard Charts in 1970.  The music is great.  &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; shows the hard rock of the bands.  &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot; shows the Blues.  &quot;That's The Way&quot; shows the acoustic.  &quot;Tangerine&quot; shows the southern rock.  It is a nice CD, and any Zeppelin fan will enjoy it.
B000021XS0|2.0|The playing on the album is superb, however the material is totaly over-indulgent and very unaccessable. Complex for the sake of being complex. No where near as good as Falling into Infinity.
0553213105|4.0|I read this book recently as an SSR book for my Honors World Lit class.  I'm a sophmore in high school.  I found this book very interesting, although it was a bit hard to translate at times.  I would recommend the book for any teens who want to read a challenging classic.  :)
B0000013G9|5.0|CrazySexyCool was one of the best R&amp;B albums of the 90's. The CD showcases Tionne, Lisa and Rozonda's ability to grow together as a group, and their superb harmonies. Every song is a hit. Creep, Waterfalls, Red Light Special and Diggin on You are the big hits on the album but there are plenty others. There's some original R&amp;B grooves here and nearly every song showcases the group's ability's to sing together, as well as it showcases their own individial strengths. If you want creative, good music with a positive message, then I suggest you buy this cd.
6303430570|5.0|kevin smith took his first crack at writing and directing with this using a risky yet ingenious method. he filmed the movie in black and white which gives the feeling of seeing from a security monitor point of view which works being that most of the movie involves a convienient store clerk named grant hicks who is stuck at work when he has to fill in for someone who calls off sick, however hes not alone as his irresponsible friend who works at the video store next to him visits frequently and his girlfriend to whom he gets into a quarrel  with over there sex lives. plus the usual (and unusual) brand of customers.  the movie has alot of twists including a hockey game on the roof of the store, a funeral misshap and the intrusions of two loiter rats names jay and silent bob(kevin smith) and one of grants ex-girlfriends. this is a hilarious movie which reminds us just how life can be so incarserating and yet so funny.
0684853523|5.0|This is a great book. Mr. King shares not only details of his life, spots and all, but he then goes on to tell us what he does and how, exactly, he does it. He tells us the place of his writing, the time of it, the vocabulary, the grammar, the phrase, the sentence, and the paragraph, all presented with the love of a craftsman and the care of a parent. Speaking of parents, my daughter grappled this book away from me. She is aged nine, and is a writer and wants to be a writer. I just advised her to avoid the rough beginning, for now, and she began to read in the Toolbox, and then, On Writing. One could do much worse. What and why does one write? Mr. King suggests that the writer has no choice in the matter. One just has to write about what one wants to know, and there is a personal and public duty to do so as well as possible. Our writing is a testament to our humanity, as is this book, and bad writing is a testament to our lack of it. I would urge this book on every school board, and pray to see well-thumbed paperback copies in large print in every knapsack.
B00004TS0E|4.0|This updated version of &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; is a wonderful adaptation of the original Christmas classic. Mara Wilson is adorable as the little girl who doesn't believe in Santa, and Richard Attenborough plays a completely beliveable Kris Kringle who will have even the biggest &quot;humbug&quot; believing in Santa before the film is over. I watch this movie every year [at Christmas] and love it more with each and every viewing. If you love Christmas and all of those &quot;warm, fuzzy&quot; feelings that come with the season, then this movie can't miss.
B000002KFJ|5.0|The best Sabbath album and the best metal album ever! Especially Megalomania is unsurpassed. Better than Antisocial of Trust, One of Metallica or Touch Too Much of AC/DC. Twenty years ago I heard this album for the first time. First I thought it was ugly, after several times listening to it, i loved  it. All songs are very different, but all are fantastic! Only the cover of the album sucks. Everything else sounds fresh still after 25 years. If you think anything is comparable please write me!
B00004W55E|5.0|I had to add my voice to the chorus.  Rachelle has done it again! She is the epitome of excellence and her music just carries us through.  I love the CD it will definitely be an early stocking stuffer for friends, family and acquaintaces during the holiday season.  As I said, I love the whole CD - I listen to it every single day!  I am going to have to break down and buy another copy... I have worn this one through already.  It's great music for the head and the heart.<br />I can't wait to see and experience another Rachelle performance at Kimball's East, Emeryville, CA.  She definitely turns the place out and upside down.  I look forward to hearing her perform any and all of the &quot;Individuality&quot; pieces LIVE.  She definitely takes us to another world through the language of music.  <br />I'll see yall in the FRONT ROW 'cause this album is FIRST CLASS! Rachelle, Thank you for holding out for your own special ARTISTIC EXPRESSION.  We love it and it is well worth the wait.  The music and lyrics stick to the ribs and to the soul.
B00003CXDG|5.0|This movie had a lot of action as I'd expected from a John Woo movie.  I enjoyed it. This is one of the best movie's I've seen recently.  I expected to be entertained.  I was.
B00004SCX6|3.0|Toss the name in the garbage pail.  Put her image out the door.  I'm ready to dig into the new Britney Spears CD, for the sake of actually hearing what she has to offer in terms of her musical abilities.<br />&quot;Oops, I did it Again&quot; is not the best album in the world, but it's not totally pathetic either.  I believe it lies somewhere inbetween.  It could very well be a discount rack item in the next few years, when the music scene changes, and Britney will be forced to show her real talent.<br />I don't believe Britney can show her abilities on this teeny-pop album, which is getting to be a tired act.  If you're looking for lyrical inspiration, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for something to dance to, you might be able to get by.  If you're looking for talent, I shrug my shoulders.  I do believe she has talent, but it's not present on this album.<br />The sound of this album is repetative, with most of the songs sounding like they're on a continuous loop.  It's not a bad thing, if you have killer material, but this is not killer by any means.<br />We'll see the true talent of Ms. Spears in the upcoming years, if and when she moves away from this tiresome bubble gum pop act.
B00004YA66|5.0|I bought the DVD and was very happy with it.  The cast was great. The movie kept my attention and I can easily sit through this a second time.  Dennis Quaid is a favorite of mine, and he had a great performance.  Can't wait to see his next movie.
6305949980|5.0|I'am a big Tim Burton fan and i love everything is related to animation, american or japanese. My favorites animated movies are The lion king, the beauty and the beast, antz, winhs of honneamise, naussica and, of course, the nightmare before christmas. I think this is the one i like the most. Is funny, scary, sweet...bizarre. All i love in a movie. This  movie was directed by henry selick, one of the best stop-motion directors. Besides, i like Christmas! and there are a lot of christmas movies i love but this is my favorite. True, if you have never seen this movie, don't think twice, watch it whit all your family. Kids and grown-ups will love this perfect master piece.

B00003CWL6|2.0|All the raving about the film itself is well deserved.  If you're looking for great DVD picture quality, however, you'd best stay away from this one.<br />The encoding job is horrible, and glitches pop up all over the place.  Note the flickering mini-blinds in the for-sale house, jerkily-moving backgrounds during various pans, mirage-like effects on supposedly straight lines.  If you're a purist and care about picture quality, you should wait until they distribute a better version.  This disc demonstrates how DVD technology is not yet ready for prime time.
B00000JZIK|2.0|Something just didn't sit right with me at the end of this movie. To be honest, I would have been happier had the twist at the end not been pulled.<br />Even though Spacey delivers a bravura performance (more than worthy of his Oscar), the script itself seems to trip over its own feet at the end. Now, don't get me wrong, I found a lot of the plot quite entertaining, but pulling the rug out from under the viewer and wiping away 2 hours of movie in doing so doesn't instantly put me to my knees praising it.<br />Also, it tries to be a little too stylish at points, making the protagonists of the story pull off these wild heists and stunts, yet never showing set-up, and giving them the ability to do this just because they're &quot;really good&quot; at what they do.<br />But because it had an original idea, it was destined for classic status. I can live with that, but only because I don't agree.
B000000OAN|4.0|`A night at the opera' is often referred to as Queen's `Sergeant Pepper', in the sense that it's not their best album but the first one you should get as an introduction.  I have done a summary of each song as follows:<br />1. Death on two legs - A brilliant fast paced rocker, with sickening lyrics about a former manager.  A great start to the album<br />2. Lazing on a Sunday afternoon - a typical early type of Queen song.  A short, humorous, one minute song with off-key notes and ridiculously camp lyrics.<br />3. Im in love with my car -  A roger Taylor rock song about his love for cars.<br />4. You're my best friend - a beautiful slow song, one of Queen's best.<br />5. 39 - A Brian May `Paul-McCartney-sounding' acoustic ballad.  Sounds very folky, with lovely harmony vocals.<br />6. Sweet Lady - Queen venturing into hard rock/heavy metal, trying to prove they could rock as well as any other band - obviously they couldn't.  Not one of my favourites, I have to say.<br />7. Seaside Rendevous - very similar to no.2, but much better.  The kind of song you would expect to hear on a 50's pleasure beach.<br />8. The Prophets Song - The second most adventurous song on the album (next to you you know what) .  An 8 minute epic, with multi-layered harmonies abound.<br />9. Love of my life - The most beautiful song on the album, and for the matter, the most beautiful Freddie ever wrote.  He puts so much feeling and emotion into this song its almost like you cant take it.  He would try to imitate this song in many future albums, but would never equal it. ( the rock band Extreme did a different but equally as good cover of this song, if anyones interested)<br />10.  Good company - an average song by Brian May featuring a ukele.  Features the usual treatment of harmonies by Brian.  <br />11. Bohemian Rhapsody - a song that needs no description.  If you've never heard this, then you've never heard any song, any time, any place.<br />12.  God save the queen - a guitar-oriented version of the English national anthem.  Nothing special, just a simple round-off to a magnificent album.
0671034065|5.0|I've always enjoyed Ms. Howard's writing, but she has truly outdone herself with &quot;Mr. Perfect&quot;.  The mix of humor, romance and suspense is just right.  I laughed out loud so many times while reading this book, my husband began to think I'd lost it.   Jaine is a great character, prone to cursing and jumping into the middle of fights.  The banter between Jaine and her neighbor, Sam, is witty and quick. Do yourself a favor and pick it up.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|I have heard and bought many CD's by many artists - none have ever moved me in the way that AFFIRMATION does!  The emotion applied to the lyrics, the music - sheer genious!! I think that the songs are written so that us mere mortals can relate to the words, it can lift you to the highest peaks, bring joy when you are in love or be your soul mate for brooding over lost love.  Perfect boys, just perfect - pleeease can we have some more!!
B00004TRD8|5.0|This is one of those DVD's that you wait for with bated breath. I was very fortunate to get a copy for 15 in an on-line auction. This was to be my first DTS soundtrack DVD and it gave me the excuse to buy the Videologic DTS sound system. It was with eargerness that I placed the DVD into my player and cranked up the sound system. Right from the menus it's apparent that this is something never seen before even surpassing the excellent DVD of 'The Abyss'. The DTS sound test and specially-created THX logo's are beyond what can be described. The quality of the film is excellent. The terminator's metal bofy gleams and the laser shots are crisp and well defined. The sound is beatifully separated and  is the best of all the DVD's that I have played. The three versions of the film all have their plusses and minusses but the seamless branching between them is excellent. Then of course, there is a second disc full of the 'extras' that DVD buyers have come to expect. However, these are more. Trailers, documentaries, video segments. All are good quality and give the viewer full immersion in the Terminator world. When the DVD is used in a PC there is a novelty factor in being able to watch the movie and have the script side-by-side to compare. This is undoubtedly the best DVD around as an all-round package. It's just a shame that other DVD producer's don't take the time to try and give the same treatment to other great films.
B00004YW6I|3.0|PJH just can't make a bad record. But this one not the best or simply ordinary. This one is only a compendium of well-known and loved  PJH' moves. If your're a proselite - 'Stories' for you as a beginner. If a hardcore fan - for you all the same. But if you want to find here something, anything new from PJH, you'd better wait for another day and be happy with old recordings of our Polly-the-goddess. And praise Tom Yorke for The Mess We're In.
0792838084|5.0|Gasp, shockingly good.  I found this movie in high school with a good friend, I think we went around quoting it for 3 years afterwards.   BV, like much of Lynch's work, seeks to examine the seamy underbelly of American life.  He does it with good, dark humor, and obvious affection.   The photography in BV is absolutely brilliant: from the clear, sharp colors of Lumberton to the dark, lush tones of Dorothy's apartment, there is always something to look at anew.   As other reviewers have mentioned, my favorite scene is one where Hopper goes to visit a drug dealer/pimp buddy of his, played with perfect creepy charm by Dean Stockwell.  That scene is so right on the money, I don't think I'll ever forget it. Just great, great, great.
B000000H6Y|5.0|5 Stars and no explanation.  Buy the CD and find out why this is one of the best goth metal albums ever made.  You won't be dissapointed.
0312958455|5.0|I don't like Los Angeles much but when Michael Connelly writes about it through the eyes of Harry Bosch, I can't stop turning the pages.<br />In this, the fourth, Harry Bosch novel, readers are let into the heart and soul of a man who you don't think you could like (drinks too much, an in your face smoker and generally dark sort of guy) and you end up wanting to name your next cat after him.  Actually, Harry probably would prefer a dog but the independent, ornery nature of a cat seems more true.<br />Harry's on suspension and finds himself digging into the unsolved murder of his prostitute mother.  By the time he's done we've learned plenty about Los Angeles in the early 60's, politics and the angst of a policeman without a badge.  My husband, a former cop, simply shakes his head at Connelly's ability to express the experience of a renegade cop.<br />We listen to these as books on tape and 13 hours go by in flash.  Connelly's books are terrifically paced and this one has one heck of an ending.
6305399212|5.0|This is the sequel to the 1979 hit &quot;Alien&quot;, and it's even better than the original, which is rare in the movie industry.  Watching &quot;Aliens&quot; is like getting on a super-fast roller coaster.  The pace starts out slow, then gets steadily faster and more intense.  And I mean intense!  The actors are terrific, and the sets and special effects are extremely impressive.  The special edition has a few scenes cut from the original release.  I'd say most of them are beneficial to the movie and helps develop the story better.
0684135051|5.0|This is the book that can change you from a casual hobby knitter to a KNITTER.  Perhaps not the best way to learn your purls and knits, but wonderful if you're tired of being a blind follower of patterns.  EZ can teach you how to be a thinking knitter - and one with a sense of humor.  Scared of steeking a sweater (i.e. cutting it with sissors)?  EZ will guide you through the process in detail and finish with the advice to drink a glass of wine, lie on the bed and recover.<br />I'm a serious knitter and while I've mastered the technics of the book long ago, I still pick it up for EZ's wonderful, chatty style.  The typos drive some people crazy but make the book all the more real for me.

B00004XONN|4.0|I just want to add a different perspective in all this. Lets face it, Radiohead have been hailed, since The Bends, as the most important band in the World. They developed haunting tunes and beautiful lyrics and were brilliant at that. However, like any great band they are evolving and synthesising a new sound. This record should not be taken as an attempt to sound 'electronica', any more than the Beatles should be taken as trying to do 'Indian' music. I'm sure you could argue that in the same way as people say that Afex Twin etc do ELECTRONICA better than Radiohead, some people in some village in India did INDIAN musicbetter than the Beatles. Its not all about the genre, its about what you are communicating, and who you are communicating it to. If Radihead had release this as their first album no-one would have cared - but the fact is that they have built up their music so people UNDERSTAND what they are trying to do. If you don't get THAT, you won't get Kid A. If you do, then it will blow you away!
B000000W3G|5.0|What I have to say is simple: If you love the Pumkins, you will love the box. Easy.
B0000508U6|4.0|As you can see by the other reviews, this album seems to remind people a lot of Radiohead.  There is no doubt that this English band has heard The Bends a thousand times over, but their temple of worship is obviously Grace, Jeff Buckley's masterpiece.  And what better artist to emulate, really?  Give a listen and you can hear Buckley-esque, falsetto voice quivers and meloncholy guitar.  Other tunes seem more geared to Nick Drake.  While the influences are obvious, it does not sound like they are consciously trying to imitate.  The songs are strong and pretty and a great listen when you are aching for new Jeff Buckley material.
B00004XOWM|5.0|This is a great CD.  Both versions of Rollin, Getcha Groove On, and The One are awesome.   Quickly became one of my favorite CDs in my huge collection, even though I was not a big LM fan before this CD.
B00000JG41|5.0|If you've never heard of Mr. Bungle, don't feel surprised! You are but one of many unfortunate souls who have been sheltered from the pure genius of this unique band.  I have heard many compare Bungle to Frank Zappa, (which I find to be an insult to the band!) Don't get me wrong Zappa was cool,( in a spacy, &quot;far-out&quot; kinda way!) Truth is,Mr. Bungle is like no other band,(and no other band is like Mr. Bungle.) A good example of the band's uniqueness : on THIS album you can really hear the Brian Wilson overtones described by guitarist Trey Spruance.  But, that is not to say this sounds like the &quot;Beach Boys&quot;. Their previous release &quot;Disco Volante&quot; sounds like the most expiremental album ever made.  And their self-titled, major label debut &quot;Mr. Bungle&quot; is the BEST album to listen to while trippin' on acid. (I think the Bungle fans can definately agree to that.)  I think &quot;California&quot; or &quot;Mr. Bungle&quot; would be a good start for a virgin listener.(I don't recommend &quot;Disco Volante&quot; for a first time Bungle listener, it might be a little too insane for their fragile little minds.) In closing, if you like bands like Korn, Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock,etc., than Mr. Bungle is a little to over your head. But, if you're looking for something interesting or artistic than check Mr. Bungle out, I garauntee you WON'T be sorry! (On a different subject, alot of Slipknot fans probably have no idea that their whole &quot;mysterious&quot; mask thing, was done by Mr. Bungle over 10 years ago, and DONE BETTER! Don't beleive me, check them out for yourselves!
0684867621|5.0|I just finished reading this book and I think it was one of his best. Not his best but one of his best. The Editorial Reviews says everything. You can just see this poor child lost in the woods and feel her pain and her fear. I was glad it was only 219 pages because I couldn't wait to find out what happered to her. I am not interested in baseball or know anything about it but I was glad that child had someone to keep her from going totally nuts. I raved about this book to other readers and talked them into reading it. Thank you Stephen for writing a book I could sit down and read in a couple of day.
B00000J6AG|5.0|When ever I head ou to clubs the music I find there is often a repeat of the same beat over and over,  Moby is a great deal different.  Even though there is a great deal of repeat in play it used for a background for experimentation in sound.  The repetion is mantra like and soothing, but dynamincs and suttle changes in the music make it great to listen too.  I have never heard club music like this before and I will look at more of it with more reverence because of PLAY.<br />Find My Baby is a great song listen to it and you will know what I am talking about.<br />Porcelain is as fine as they come great mantra like vocals that get you by the heart strings.  <br />South side is a great deal of perfect drums and shows how MOBY can vary a theme <br />Mechete and Run On are his best on this CD.  They are wity and stay in you mind after you hear them.<br />My Weakness is a Jem to<br />There are tons of more great tracks. Great for swaying and danceing to. But cool to listen too.
0679879269|1.0|When The Golden Compass first came out, readers were introduced to a rich mix of strong, unforgettable characters set in an alien world so much like ours and yet so different. Chief among these was Lyra, the foul-mouthed, ill-mannered, lying little university brat who somehow managed to steal our hearts and sympathies.<br />When Will came along in The Subtle Knife and dominated the landscape, I was left with a sense of betrayal.  Where did Lyra's character go?  She just seemed to flatten out. Some would say that she had grown up, but -- what a loss! Still, I held out hope that the third and final book would release her and the rest of her friends from the cage the author had placed them in.<br />Ouch.  The Amber Spyglass did not do that; in fact, it only served to draw readers to the conclusion Pullman was apparently trying to reach from the beginning: Organised Religion is Bad.  Or, more precisely, Judiasm and Christianity are Bad.  We certainly don't want to place yet another British author under threat of fatwa, now do we?  But I digress. Needless to say, everything is defeated by Will (get the name now?), and all the universes return to normal.<br />All in all, a tragic end to a promising start.
B00001U0GQ|3.0|Those who wrote the film Last of the Mohicans is inaccurate in it's adaption of James Feminore Cooper's novel should realize that Coopers novel to begin with is an inaccurate portrayal of earl American colonial life. In fact, not only is the novel outlandishly stupid,insulting to native americans but also completely unreadable. This is one of those rare instances when the film surpasses the novel in every conceivable way. As for the DVD version, yes I was extremely dissapointed but I am eagerly awaiting the original version to be released in January 2001.
B000051VWW|4.0|After not hearing from her in so long, I was excited to listen to Sade's latest.  If you like her brand of sultry R&amp;B this disc doesn't disappoint.  I especially like 'Flow' and 'All About Our Love'.  Hopefully, this won't be her only CD for the next 8 years!
044022165X|1.0|I don't understand how people can actually like this book. Compared to Grisham's previous novels (such as The Firm, the Client, and A Time to Kill) this novel absolutely sucks. He takes no time in development in his characters. Rudy Baylor is an arrogant, self righteous lawyer who preaches about the woes of big corporations. It's not if he has any experience in the matter. He's fresh out of high school. His girlfriend Kelly is the sterotypical beat up woman who returns to her man again and again and almost gets herself killed. Why can't he return to the helpful and intelligent women such as Abby in the Firm? Or in the Client? Kelly has to depend on Rudy, who isn't a stable himself, to get her out of the mess she's gotten herself into. The Rainmaker lacks character, it lacks orginality, and it lacks thought. Spend more time on your novels John Grisham!!
B000051VWW|5.0|This is a great return for Sade, evrytime i was listening to her past album i was wandering if she was still singing. The album was worth the wait, it's Sade at it's best. I think the two greatest song are Slavesong and imigrant. I just hope that her next album wont take that long again.
B000050XEI|5.0|I have been listening to Enya since I was 13 and I have to say she has never let me down.  I am so impressed with her new recordings.  Lazy Days and Wild Child and One by One, are the best in my eyes.   I have listened to this CD a million times already and will be buying the CD for many of my friends this holiday.  I am sure they will love it! She has retained some of her &quot;sounds&quot; from Memory of Trees.  But that does not hinder her new songs.  You will surely enjoy it.  I still get goose bumps when I listen to her music.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I'm so glad Hollywood is moving towards releasing DVDs so soon after the movie is released. In fact, you could probably still catch this movie at your local 24 screen theater (It's currently November 14th, 2000), and it's worth the theatrical experience.  At any rate, although the movie is fairly long, you'll be on the edge of your seat for the vast majority of the movie. Crowe does a great job of looking mean, hurt, and angry whenever he has to. True, it's a little graphic, but you've got to expect that. Buy this movie, then if it's not too late, go watch it in the theaters.
B00000IAU3|5.0|An album of great songs, many of which are reminiscent of a British group of long ago - the Zombies. I can't stop playing this CD over and over again. This happens maybe once per decade. Great lyrics are rare these days, and the melodies are thankfully uncomplicated by  a lot of hi-tech noise. I recommend it enthusiastically to the world!
B00003CX8J|4.0|Okay, since this is only the 14th, it's obvious I haven't seen the DVD, but the movie is great.  Don't let movies like Batman and Robin (arguably the worst movie ever) fool you. This is a really good super hero movie, featuring a director that actually knows his stuff.  Hugh Jackman does a great job as wolverine, and you'll probably not even notice his accent (yeah, he does have one!). Fans of Episode 1 will also notice that Ray Park plays Toad, and although he doesn't do a lot of the moves he did in EP1 it's still awesome to watch him do what little he does. Great one-liners,  nice actor/actress chemistry, and a storyline that manages to avoid being corny make this a great DVD to buy.
B000051VWW|5.0|For eight long years, die-hard Sade fans have been waiting for Sade to release another studio album. &quot;Lovers Rock&quot; was worth the wait. She has managed to mix her trademark smooth style with new, fresh beats. Songs that stand out are &quot;King of Sorrow,&quot; &quot;Flow,&quot; and my personal favorite &quot;Somebody Already Broke My Heart.&quot; I just got it today and I've already listened to it three times. It's a gem. I can't even compare it to her other CDs because it's different, yet so perfect. What a joy to have her and her fabulous band back (Andrew Hale especially seems more mature in his keyboard playing). Welcome back Sade!
B00004NRWH|1.0|heres another band that tries so hard to sound like something thats already succesful. since everyone fell for CREED which is  another band with no abundance of talent, Roadrunner thought that you might go for this too. its pretty safe. i bought this record not knowing what it would sound like but i was a fool...it's not that great...whiny, boring &quot;i've heard this somewhere before&quot; lyrics mixed with really familiar sounding guitars and songs...why buy???
6305014140|4.0|Ninja scroll is one of the best japanimation moves I've seen in a long time. The script and charcters were right on.It has an old fashion japanese setting that tells the tale of a Japanese Ninja who has nothing but his sword and his wits, fighting against the forces of evil. This move is awesome. Why don't they have more movies like this?

B00004XMVL|2.0|One of the great virtues of science fiction movies in general is that they take us to places that are often, at the very least, somewhat visually interesting, which is half the reason to go to the movies no matter what genre you're talking about.  If a director can wed that visual element to a good story and strong characters, sometimes you get something really memorable.  Pitch Black succeeds with the visual element and two very good characters (given depth by Radha Mitchell and Vin Diesel, the actors who portray them), but the story doesn't possess much tension beyond what exists between those two characters and the usual &quot;who gets eaten next&quot; anxiety that so many horror films play off of.  The opening scene is strong and effectively disorienting, and the daylight shots, bled of color, give the first part of the film a great look.  The aliens (we mostly just glimpse them) are well done and scary enough, but it's painfully obvious that most of the characters, because of their amazing ineptitude, aren't going to survive (would that more sci fi directors take a cue from &quot;Aliens&quot; and people their films with capable, intelligent *humans* instead of mere ciphers).  Most disconcertingly, rather than resolving the conflict between the two main characters in a believeable manner, the film makers chose an unsatisfying ending that feels like a cheat.  Pitch Black has some admirable strengths, but its flaws guarantee that only those who want to be swept along for the occasionally enjoyable ride will want to see this film more than once.

B00003CWL6|2.0|There's a scene in American Beauty in which a teenaged boy is found filming a dead bird by two girls his age. They ask him why, and he explains, &quot;Because it's beautiful.&quot; That's one opinion: another, which also applies to &quot;American Beauty,&quot; is that no matter how beautifully you light, film and score it, something foul and rotten is still foul and rotten. <br />Director Sam Mendes is clearly gifted; cinematographer Conrad Hall's use of color and light is stunning; the music is haunting, and the cast talented, and even Alan Ball's script shows a deliberate intelligence too many movies lack. But none of these elements can disguise the fact that this movie is sad, cynical and sick at heart. It's a mean-spirited chronicle of suburbia as hell which tries to patch itself over with a feel-good moral and fails utterly. <br />With the possible exception of one semi-redeeming choice Kevin Spacey's character makes at the end of the film, none of the main characters exhibit any likeable or even remotely worthwhile traits. Spacey's Lester Burnham goes from being a wimp to an arrogant lecher; Annette Benning as his wife is a shrill Martha Stewart caricature; Mena Suvari, as Burnham's teenaged lust object, is profoundly unlikeable; Thora Birch's daughter character is selfish and sullen; her creepy love interest, boy-next-door Wes Bentley, deals drugs when he's not filming her obsessively. Then there's Bentley's abusive ex-Marine dad... the list goes on and on.  <br />No one is having a good time in American Beauty. Everyone is miserable. And the one person who figures out a way to escape that misery is horribly dead soon after. There is a worthwhile message in American Beauty, as well as one utterly lovely scene involving nothing more than a videotape of a windblown plastic bag. But the brighter elements of this movie feel hastily tacked on to its warped, unrealistically dark world view, and in the end they cannot compensate for the utter, gaping landfill wherethis film's moral center ought to be.

B00003CXFG|3.0|Hell has surely frozen over. That's the only way to explain how David Twohy, writer-director of the so-bad-it's-hilarious Charlie Sheen skydiving epic &quot;Terminal Velocity,&quot; has made a movie this good. It's not high art, but &quot;Pitch Black&quot; is a triumph within its genre: a suspenseful, intelligent monster movie with surprisingly deep characters. <br />A damaged spaceship loaded with cargo and cryo-sleeping passengers crash-lands on an alien world where three suns create perpetual daylight. At first, the survivors think their biggest problem is the vicious convict who's escaped from the wreckage. Then they discover the light-fearing predators lurking beneath the planet's surface. And then comes the total eclipse... <br />&quot;Pitch Black&quot; is a Diesel-powered movie-- Vin Diesel, that is. As the menacing convict Richard P. Riddick, Diesel gives a ferociously intelligent and charismatic performance,  backed up by Twohy's surprisingly nuanced script. You'll come to root for Riddick as the movie wears on, but that doesn't necessarily mean you'll like him.  <br />Radha Mitchell is also fine as the novice pilot Fry, battling inner and outer demons as she tries to hold the survivors together; Cole Hauser does a nice turn as Riddick's captor; and the fine supporting cast includes Keith David as a Muslim cleric (a refreshingly positive portrayal of Islam) and &quot;Farscape&quot;'s always-excellent Claudia Black. <br />&quot;Pitch Black&quot; is an embarrassment of riches for sci-fi fans: characters who continually surprise you, creepy creatures left mostly up to your imagination, and a stripped-down story that moves at a breakneck pace. Perfect popcorn entertainment-- just be sure you don't turn _all_ the lights off before you watch it...
0399146253|3.0|hmm..well, I do love Patricia Cornwell, and I did scarf this book just as quickly as all of her previous efforts. However..I believe it lacked some of the fire of her preceeding novels.  Don't get me wrong, I stand behind her work 110%, but I just feel as if there was something lacking.  I love Scarpetta's house and the way she cooks..and the sheer effort she puts into a case...I felt that there was just too much of this novel spent in turmoil.  Definitely a lit noir!  At any rate, I enjoyed it, and I will continue to buy her novels, but this one left me slightly disappointed.
B000001GQB|5.0|Having owned Bohm's complete traversal of Mozart's forty-one symphonies (in two separate boxed sets released by DG--- DGG, back then--- over thirty years ago), and having relinquished them during my LP-to-CD changeover, I was delighted by this surprise, mid-price reissue. Frankly, I had forgotten just how Mozartian Bohm is, how clean and clear--- like a breath of spring air--- and as downright refreshing; yet, too, how sensitive he is to the myriad nuances of these works. His is a pure energy, a pure depth that comes from wisdom, not show. Bohm conducts focused, dedicated, immersed--- and these symphonies appear to us miraculously renewed, classically shining. No doubt about it: these are performances borne out of love. So simpatico is Bohm's approach to Mozart, I hesitate to even call them \\"performances.\\" More likely, each is a devotional.<br /><br />[Running time:  CD 1:  67:57  CD 2:  78:55]
6305558167|5.0|Isn't that what myths and legends are all about?I practically grew up with this film as a young teen during  dungeons and dragons days and countless showings on HBO back in the mid 1980's . How many times have I seen the film even BEFORE DVD? Don't ask . It is simply one of my favorites because director John Boorman captures the essense of humanity on film the way Shakesphere did on paper and Frank Lloyd Wright did in concrete . But alas , it is the darker side that lurks in us all . Only Boorman's talent can bring it to life on film . It's here for all to see . &quot;You have broken the unbreakable!&quot; uttered in a Wagerian background is but one of the countless scenes of beauty that make this film a true materpiece . And on that note , &quot;Why do you come for the grail!?&quot;.
0671034065|2.0|Though Gidget never cursed as much as Jaine, the whole book really did read like the main characters were teenagers and not older, supposedly mature people.  The only reason why I kept reading was because it was lunch time and I was at work and I only had the one book with me.  If this was the first Linda Howard book I had picked up, I never would pick up another one by her. I regret buying the book in hardback but some of the reviews were so glowing that I took a chance even seeing the few negatives.  I should have listened to the negatives.  I really don't get much of a chance to read, so when I can find some time I want to get into something really, really good.  With Mr. Perfect, I feel I have wasted my valuable time on trash.  Where I really wanted to give this book a 1, I opted for 2 because I did laugh at some parts.

006097625X|1.0|It is a simple matter to discern when a Golden Age has ended by the sort of heavy analysis which immediately ensues;  heavy, as in \\"by-the-boatload,\\" not in terms of enlightening consequence. With no more real wheat to delight in, academics and born-too-late types busy themselves with the chaff of review and dissection.  Citizen Kane was a single movie which, in the sequel of sixty years, has produced a horde of 500-some books, doctoral theses, and other various forms of minute analysis. Yet Mr. Welles' film remains unaltered by said avalanche, merely peering back through the ages at its commentators with a smile that says, \\"you may chatter about me as ceaselessly as you please-but you could never create me!\\"<br />The Great Days of the cartoon-including animated shorts, comic books, political cartoons and newspaper strips-are generally accounted to have occupied the first half of the 20th Century, after which television did its steamroller bit on radio, movies, weekly magazines and the cartoon alike. Folks these days may not be able to write and draw great cartoons anymore, but we sure can jabber about them. It's fun to be a self-appointed authority, and it's far easier than the painful baby steps of learning to draw well, or training the mind to think up arresting visual continuities and involving plot-lines.  Hence Scott McCloud's fairly-recent offering into this field of texts which, as the old saw goes, \\"fill a much-needed void.\\"<br />The title of Mr. McCloud's book is humorous in that the comics are a medium understood intrinsically by practically any person aged four years and up. The supposition behind his book, of course, is that this is only because the art form never left its infancy; that the potential of the comic medium is more untapped than otherwise. The error here is that attempts of late to force the comic to \\"grow up\\" and \\"expand\\" have been, to use a popular phrase of the day, \\"style over substance\\"; four-letter words, teeth-gnashing rage, self-indulgent angst, glib posturing, freewheeling sex, and most of all, lots and lots and LOTS of hack drawing, amateur plotting &amp; scripting, and pyrotechnic continuity which cannot be clearly followed. That these childish squalls were ignored by the once comics-loving public is testament to the unappealing deficiencies which bind lesser talents. The works of Mr. McCloud's contemporaries have been, in mass, slicked-up nothings-tramps in $2,000 suits-and his own efforts (ZOT!) have never risen above mediocrity despite the vast \\"understanding\\" which he has contrived from whole cloth and placed herein.<br />There is no true profundity in the book, which automatically dictates that scads of critics will suggest it is there in spades. The author brings home his seemingly-obvious points with sledgehammer force, as though with each passing \\"revelation\\" we are to strike the forehead with the palm, eyes widened. Like most such volumes, Mr. McCloud has inflated his superfluous notions with an esoteric padding, sure to rake in the eggheaded suckers, and ready to repel the charge of \\"Yeah, so what?\\" with: \\"Well, if you don't like it, then you must not understand it.\\"<br />Yet if this volume makes clear any point whatever, it is that Mr. McCloud himself understands very little about comics-or at any rate, their appeal. The probity of good cartooning has always been and will always be a good story, well-drawn and simply-told. The trick is to work within those conventions rather than peremptorily dismissing them as ancient. The kind of ivory-tower imaginings which infest this and other identical books of analysis will never replace the hard work and ingenuity which were the hallmarks of the masters of the art. Citing the possibilities of a lump of clay makes a sculptor of no one, nor will anything but diligent and concentrated effort. For Scott McCloud to suggest that comics can be so much more than they have been is all well and good, but people have had more leisure time for examination, reflection and training since the 1950s than ever before-so where are the great comics? It is talk. The ignorance of the learned. Hal Foster of \\"Tarzan\\" and \\"Prince Valiant\\" fame claimed never to have dissected his art or storytelling technique. Yet he is certainly one of the ten greatest newspaper strip cartoonists of all time. How on Earth did he manage it without the guiding hands of Gilbert Seldes, Will Eisner or Scott McCloud?<br />The much-revered art instructor Kimon Nicolaides, who died in 1938, said: \\"I have had students who seemed to be more interested in `being artists' than in drawing. They were enthralled by a train of mental ideas rather than the feeling of responding on paper to a vivid experience of the senses. Such students are likely to be found, not sitting in front of the model, but sitting over a cup of coffee in a neighboring caf&eacute;, talking about art. The student who really learns to draw will be the one who draws. As Leonardo said, the supreme misfortune is when theory outstrips performance.\\" I mention this quote because the greatest of cartoonists were first and foremost ARTISTS-they later became cartoonists, and trained themselves individually to do so by trial and error. In this way, numberless styles, yarns and deathless creations flooded the field. There was no time for pontification or self-analysis-those men just kept cranking and kept improving. They had deadlines. We have theory. They had talent. We have their reprint books.<br />And so, I suggest that if you plan to spend $18.00 in your efforts to \\"understand comics,\\" you do it on the reprinted works of Messrs. McCay, Outcault, Crane, Foster, Caniff, Sickles, McManus, Opper, Segar, Sterrett, Herriman, et al. Their cartooning legacies are all the education-and more importantly, all the enjoyment-that you need ever hope for from a wonderful but long-deceased art form.mination, reflection and training since the 1950s than ever before-so where are the great comics?

B000001GX5|5.0|I would have to say that &quot;Pines of Rome&quot; is one of, if not my favorite orchestral peices ever composed!  I happened to come by this recording by Karajan by accident, and i've never regretted it since.  It is, by far, the best recording I have heard of Resphighi's masterpeice to date.  There is a depth to the sonority of the sound that is not heard in many other recordings, and as always, Karajan seems to know exactly what the composer had envisioned the peice[s] to sound like.  The tempos, dynamics, and overall interpretation of the peices seem to be perfect in execution.  Combine that with the masterfull playing and technique of the world-class ensemble of the Berlin Philharmonic, and you have a combination of pure perfection.  I also liked the &quot;Fountains of Rome&quot; recording of this CD, it being of the same high quality and sound as &quot;Pines&quot;.        My only qualms with this recording is the amount of ambient noises that can be heard throughout the recording.  Whether it be what sounds like a dropped bow by a string player, or a chair being moved, or a floorboard creaking, these sounds can clearly be heard.  HOWEVER, one soon forgets these minor inconveniences once the orchestra starts to play the peices, and the greatness of the technique and sound can be heard (combined with the melodious genius of Respighi).  This is a definite must have for all Respighi fans.
B000051VWW|5.0|I am in awe. From the opening hook of By Your Side to the vibrant colors found in the rhythms of the lowly King of Sorrows, you can't help but be drawn into Sade's ethereal web of love-misery-redemption and finally, peace. This is Sade at her finest. If you found Love Deluxe even the least bit enticing, your senses will definitely be sufficiently seduced by Lover's Rock. It is possible to get caught in the lazy, staccato movements in Immigrant and just as easy to find yourself in her shoes with Every Word's pulsing, almost palpable pain. And then will you discover as the appropriately named track closes the set, that the best discovery on the cd is when you find that  It's Only Love That Gets You Through.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I own everything the Beatles ever released --- vinyl,CD,  butchered American versions and classic British releases -- yet, I'm still buying this one. Sure, I could dump all these songs onto a single CD-R, but why waste my time. &quot;Beatles One&quot; is simply convenient -- perfect for the car, portable CD player, or any other place where you don't have the luxury of carting around the original 13 discs. In other words, this disc is tailor-made for daytrippin' and Sunday drives! (Pun intended...)Besides, where else are you    going to find 27 of the 20th Century's greatest songs on a single CD ? Yes, there are some glaring omissions -- most notably &quot;Please Please Me&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; -- but, I still can't think of a better way to enjoy 80 plus minutes. And who knows, perhaps this low-priced collection will lure members of the younger generation into the wonderful world of Beatledom. Basically, it all boils down to the music and in the case of &quot;Beatles One&quot;, the music speaks for itself.
B00003CXDG|2.0|This movie in a word, dissapointing. I expected so much more from director John Woo, whose earlier film Face Off was outstanding  and action-packed. MI2 though suffers from a deplorable lack of action, at least early on anyways. Although, it's visually stunning at times, there's really nothing here to grab you. I thought this film had very little to do with the Mission Impossible series, and more resembled John Woo's normal action films. The main problem with the film, is that it's main character, Ethan Hawke, played by Tom Cruise, gets involved in a very, long and drawn out relationship with his female co-star. The film spends far too much developing the relationship between the two, and far too little time giving us action. I also don't agree with the other reviewer's opinion that the first Mission Impossible was forgettable. The first film was much truer to  the series, and was a very sharp, smartly-acted film. It had  action when it was necessary, within the bounds of the story. I'd highly recommend the first film, and only recommend this one, if you need it as a companion piece. This is definitely not a film you'll watch over and over.
B000051VWW|5.0|Aside from one of the most erratic recording schedules in pop history, Sade has spent her career being known and revered for her indisputably original sound.  Imitators have come and gone, and countless artists site her as an influence (as controversial as it sounds, she is as important and unique to R&amp;B as the Beatles were to rock), but in the end there is only one Sade, with a voice as warm as an island breeze and grooves as fluid as an ocean's tide.  And thankfully, a seven-year hiatus after 1993's &quot;Love Deluxe&quot; hasn't dulled those sensibilities, either: the comeback record &quot;Lovers Rock&quot; proves itself exceedingly worthy of a place in her musical legacy.<br />Make no mistake; Sade is no more conscious of musical trends than she ever was.  She still favors sparse but insistent rhythms, still sings with a deceptively simple seduction, and is still backed up by the same musicians (keyboardist Andrew Hale, guitarist Stuart Matthewman, and bassist Paul Denman).  These elements make the first track (and single), &quot;By Your Side,&quot; instantly familiar, for all its melodic understatement and flowing beats.  A sort of cross between 60's rock and soul, the song is classic Sade all the way.  But be prepared to raise an eyebrow elsewhere on the record; &quot;Flow&quot; offers a surprising taste of hip-hop folk, while &quot;King of Sorrow&quot; pairs up traditional Spanish influences with a warm wah-wah guitar.  The smooth, destined-for-radio &quot;Somebody Already Broke My Heart&quot; adds a dose of modern soul, while &quot;Every Word&quot; even finds Ms. Adu dabbling in a dose of rock.<br />Another important aspect of trying new ideas is knowing when to let them end, and impressively, the reggae pop of &quot;All About Our Love&quot; and the swinging lullaby of &quot;The Sweetest Gift&quot; both clock in under three minutes and still sound like perfectly complete ideas.  The production on &quot;Slave Song&quot; is another triumph, as the surrealpercussion and keyboard effects are the perfect compliment to a lyric that tells a narrative most of us can barely even imagine; the end result is appropriately haunting.    Another effective moment comes on the socially-conscious &quot;Immigrant,&quot; which once again proves that less is more: giving examples of the humiliation a man of color endures in the face of prejudice, a simple line like &quot;to even the toughest among us/that would be too much&quot; sums things up so clearly and eloquently, the lyric gets its point with all the force of an expletive-laden rap song.<br />But the album's most irresistible moment, however, is more familiar but no less impressive: the sensual samba of the title track supports a sparse, lushly-chorded keyboard line and intricate guitar highlights, all topped off with Sade's unique poetry (&quot;I am in the wilderness/you are in the music in the man's car next to me&quot;) and a distorted spoken section thrown in for good measure.  The track represents everything a Sade fan looks for in one of her songs.  Then again, for all its musical uniqueness, gentle experimentation and stylistic maturity, &quot;Lovers Rock&quot; represents everything a Sade fan looks for in one of her albums.  She's still a smooth operator indeed.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|If anyone needs a nice mix of songs for the car, or desires to have a one-volume overview of the Beatles' astonishing career (though why you wouldn't rather collect their entire catalog is beyond this fan), then I guess this is the one. Give it to your teenagers if they are unfamiliar with the work. One quibble: &quot;Love Me Do&quot; wasn't a number one hit, but &quot;Please Please Me,&quot; here omitted, was.
0679879269|3.0|Philip Pullman's third addition to his great trilogy, is by far, worse than its precursors.  The book is awe inspiring, imaginitive, but the dialogue seems overemotional and basically silly.  However, if you are looking for a good book with good concepts look no further.  All I say is it is not as good as the rest of the trilogy and is on the edge of being histrionic.  Still it is a feat in imagery and is a grand idea.  Perhaps Pullman should have spent longer than the two or three years since the second book to perfect the dialogue.  This is all the book suffers from.  Hope this helps.
B000000FG8|5.0|after listening to the cd at first it wasn't that amazing. but after listening to it over and over every song i began to like. and now after about a year it has easily become my favorite cd. it also introduced me to other great bands that were from opiv like rancid and jesse's new band common rider. if you only have enough money to buy one cd make sure it is this one you'll be impressed.
B000053V7Q|5.0|Having watched the premiere of the New special addition of TTWIT in London last weekend I can tell you we are in for a real treat. All of the terrible interview scenes have been replaced with extra rehersals and what seems like a full concert. It is arranged in chronological order, and re-cut in a much more modern way to appeal to a new audience, this provides is a fantastic build up to the actual concert. Footage which would never have been considered 30 years ago has now been inserted, and gratful we should be. If you liked the original you are going to love this version.
B00004X01U|5.0|I'm really quite impressed with this CD. I think Madonna's recent choices (i.e. &quot;Evita&quot;, &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, &quot;Music&quot;) show that's she's really growing up. I always knew she was talented, but that hypersexual stuff was starting to get old, eh?<br />With &quot;Music&quot;, Madonna once again has her finger on the pulse of what people want to hear. Only she can make a CD that's essentially experimental, yet highly danceable and ready for mass consumption. The title track shows that Madonna hasn't lost her sense of humor or fun. <br />Many people have already dissected this CD track-for-track, so I'll spare you. But for anyone who's considering buying this CD, go ahead and try it. It's a party, and your hostess will entertain your mind, and let you exercise your &quot;groove thing&quot; for once. :) Viva Madonna!
B00004VXF2|5.0|Metal Machine Music remastered, eh?  Say, any extra tracks?  (Just kidding.)  If you hate this CD you have no one to blame but yourself.  It isn't Lou's fault; he's warned you on the cover.  The album is legendary; if you've never heard it you don't need to- - you already know what it is.  And forget all that stuff about clearing unwanteds from your party, etc.  You can do that for a lot cheaper than the price of this CD (use your imagination, Lou did).  Back in the heydey of the late, great lamented Creem magazine this was hot stuff- -everyone from Lester Bangs to Rick Johnson had their say (the &quot;review&quot; showing nothing but a full-length picture of Lou with the word NO typewritten all over it is a Creem Classic).  Everyone who heard it (and as many who didn't) took it very seriously indeed.  Except Lou- -whose tongue, planted firmly in cheek, wagged loads of incredibly intellectual nonsense concerning important things like harmonics and subharmonics affecting melodic amelodicism with undertones.  So why should you?  No, if you should somehow accidentally acquire this CD, play it loud and lie back and enjoy it.  If you acquire it on purpose, congratulations.  Play it loud and lie back and enjoy it.  It hasn't dated a bit since 1975.  How could it?
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Every genuine album the Beatles made is worth owning, but even though they were major innovators in the Lp format, they still recorded in a singles-oriented market; luckily, they were a great singles band as well, and this compilation makes that point.  Collecting only number one hits, this is an interesting CD that shows how the band evolved musically through their hit 45's.  It doesn't tell the whole story (no single disc could) and it may feel like a marketing ploy, it's still a good way of introducing a neophyte to the Beatles' music.<br />It's unfair, though, to limit this compilation to number one hits: most of their singles were double-sided gems, so such popular favorites like &quot;Revolution&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; don't make it simply because their flip sides beat them out to the top of the charts. Then, like I said, there's those albums, which rarely had any tracks put on singles; &quot;In My Life&quot; and &quot;A Day In Life&quot; are only available on the original albums.<br />Still, it's a fine introduction, if not a complete portrait, and the sound is a great improvement over pass releases. It may not be for fans who already have most of their CD's, but it's certainly a nice way to introduce someone to the band.
B000051VWW|2.0|After listening this album I am a bit disappointed by the come-back of Sade. Especially the music doesn't approach the intimite atmosphere and smoothness from earlier albums from both Sade and Sweetback. This album comes to me like a pretty cold winter...
B00000JG41|5.0|Listen to the other two albums in order first.  That's my recommendation... <BR> When I first listened to this cd, I kept expecting an aural monster to jump out from under the bed and scare the bejeezus me-- yeah, you Bungle fans remember the first time you heard Ma Meeshka Mow Skwoz-- but it never did.  In the same way, I opened the magazine, expecting at every fold to be greeted with drunken clowns or skull-spitting eyballs, but I found nothing but beautiful photos of flowers.  Beautiful.  Beautiful music!  I guess California proves that Mike Patton and Co. have as wonderful a command of subtlety as they do of power.  The &quot;softer&quot; treatment made me listen harder and pay more attention to the lyrics.  And you know what?  The fourth or fifth time around, Pink Cigarette suddenly scared the bejeezus out of me.
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|This movie is insulting to people of intelligence everywhere. Not just the horribly rendered jokes, not just the one-note abilities of the Wayans stars (in front of the camera), but in the fact that it tries to pass itself off as being in the tradition of Airplane and The Naked Gun. Gene Siskel once said that sometimes what appears to be stupid is the by product of the efforts of a great number of intelligent people. In short, the cleverness of stupidity as represented by South Park, Beavis and Butthead and Ren and Stimpy. This is none of those things. Which part was funny? The... obsessed boyfriend? The severed head still talking? Every joke is aimed directly at the lowest common denominator. And hey, if that's you, so be it. Oh and lest we forget, the rampant racism and homophobia. The 'pothead losers are funny' message, I could just go on. A movie like this lowers the bar for society.
B00000G3PA|1.0|I cannot believe anyone can take this film seriously. It is strictly comic book. The characters are all stereotypes, the action is preposterous, and the science completely wrong. It is pure action and eye candy for the reality challenged. After you watch it you'll feel like you just pigged out on cotton candy at the fair. Yuck!
B00004XONN|5.0|I really like KID A... a lot.  You can read all the other reviews for a break down on the musical style, or for complaints that it is not another OK Computer, or The Bends.  Yes, it's true, KID A *is* different than Radiohead's other releases, but if you allow yourself not to be disappointed about that fact, you're going to hear a fab new record.  I like the overall vibe of the album....or better put, the way it makes me feel when I listen to it.  I hear a lot of different influences in KID A...Pink Floyd, Mogwai, and Komeda to name three.  Like I said, you can read the other reviews to get a better understanding of the musical direction Radiohead took with KID A. I am simply writing this review to let everyone know that I dig KID A and it should be listened to closely.  It will probably take several spins to sink in, but once it does, you'll be happy.
B000002BUY|5.0|First things first, this album is incredible.<br />I have all of incubus' releases, and some rare stuff, and although I love all the albums, I marginally prefer 'Enjoy Incubus' and 'Fungus Amongus' , 's.c.i.e.n.c.e.' comes in next, followed by 'Make yourself'.<br />That doesnt however mean that its a bad album, im giving it a TOP 5 stars, a good 99% , and it shows an incredible transition from an incredible band. Some great work, some real originality, which is hard to find in alot of bands.<br />Another thing, if you like metal, then this album is a good healthy mix of metal/funk, some great great tracks, some real good samples and some nice mixing/scratching.<br />Its the best of the 'New' Incubus, it is a brilliant combination of new and old, and its a must by.<br />There are no downpoints to any incubus album i own, every single time i listen, I enjoy incubus =) <br />Pick this album up. I urge you.<br />/Jon

0875428940|5.0|There are people who collect Tarot decks for the artwork, and people who only buy decks to use.  I tend to do both, and have a colection of over 30 decks.  The Robin Wood Tarot is one of the few in my collection that is both admired for its artwork, and in regular use as a reading deck.<br />This deck is overtly Pagan, and will probably not suit anyone who likes Christian imagery in their deck.  All of the images are close enough to the &quot;standard&quot; of the Rider-Waite Tarot, to be read without difficulty for anyone familiar with that deck.  This deck uses swords=air, wands=fire symbology.<br />The best book on tarot reading in general to go with the deck is &quot;Tarot, Plain and Simple&quot;, which uses illustrations from this deck.  Robin Wood's own book, &quot;The Robin Wood Tarot, The Book&quot; is a better choice for finding out the details behind why certain cards are depicted the way they are, and is very interesting reading in its own right, but is not as clear on basic divinatory meanings, or basic Tarot reading.<br />Some of the notable card imagery in this deck:<br />The Magician:  The Magician is depicted as a Wiccan High Priest, wearing a crown of antlers, but still wearing the  traditional red and white and with all the familiar symbology.<br />The High Priestess:  Unquestionably a Wiccan priestess, with her Dianic crown and pentacle necklace, she is depicted in a familiar way, with much the same symbols as would be expected, but outdoors.<br />The Heirophant:  Robin Wood's disatisfaction with organized religion shows clearly in this card (for more details, please read her book) and is unusually negatively aspected.<br />All of the minor arcana are fully illustrated, and very clear.  Note to the modest, there is some realistically depicted nudity in this deck, although very tasteful.<br />No one deck will ever suit all people.  The deck that speaks to you, may not speak to me and vice versa.  I can only say that I have found it of use *to ME* as a good deck to read from, and hope you find it likewise.<br />If you like Robin Woods artwork, then this deck is worth collecting for the art alone, and I can also highly recomend going to her website, to see and buy more of her prints.  She now offers machine embroidery patterns, as well as doing a great deal of work on computer graphics, and fonts, and sells disks of these ready to use.<br />Blessings and Peaces a good deck to read from, and hope you find it likewise.<br />If you like Robin Woods artwork, then this deck is worth collecting for the art alone, and I can also highly recomend going to her website, to see and buy more of her prints.

B000051VWW|5.0|After many years of waiting only to settle for her greatest hits CD, Sade has returned in a big fashion with groovin beats, bass and drum tracks and her same sensual voice. She has composed and successfully  completed another classic CD for all Sade fans to enjoy. The sound is a lot like her old work but that is her trademark sound and she still delivers it on every track.  Favorite tracks are : Slave Song, Flow, King Of Sorrow and Every Word.  Go and get this one in a hurry................. Sade is Back!!<br />oNe

B0000029DD|5.0|Earlier this year I was watching the VH1 program &quot;The List&quot; and some musician chose Jeff Buckley's &quot;Lover, You Should've Come Over&quot; for what ever ridiculous category they were voting on and they played a small clip of the song.  I was blown away and immediately rushed over to a record store and picked up a copy of &quot;Grace&quot;.  I am here to tell you it is one of the greatest albums I've ever purchased and cannot put into words what I feel about this album.  From the somber beauty of &quot;Hallelujah&quot; to the chilling crescendo of So Real, you must buy this album if you like original and passionate music.
B00003CXFG|4.0|People shouldn't just dismiss this as another Aliens ripoff, it is so much more.  First of all, Vin Diesel is great, he definitely is fun to watch, he has a future in action films.  He isn't a big bodied numbskull like Dolph or Van Damme.  He has definite charisma and talent.  Second, the visual style is fantastic.  It completely convinced me that they were on another world.  The spectactular eclipse sequence is unforgettable.  The sequence is completely distinctive, director David Twohy definitely has a future.  The only part of this movie that falters is of course, the plot.  It is derivative and all the characters are stereotypes, but that doesn't take away from the fun of the picture.  I highly recommend this as a highly stylistic piece of sci-fi filmmaking.

0679879269|5.0|The Amber Spyglass, at its heart, seems to say that Christianity is a powerful mistake. Throughout the book, the Church is portrayed as evil, and even 'God' himself is shown to be a deceiving character, not the creator. However, the books are not rationalistic and materialistic in their outlook; they create a whole different theology cobbled together out of human spritual traditions. <br />In fact, the book can be shown to be unconsciously Christian, and a beautiful reaffirmation of the greatest Christian values which we sometimes tend to forget. In our haste to 'follow the Bible' we sometimes forget who Christ was- a saviour to set Mankind free. Although Pullman has stated that he wanted to revel in the physical world, and intended this book as an alternative to CS Lewis' Narnia, there is an unconscious Christian thread running through the book. First off, has anyone wondered why, with 'christianity', there is no Christ? And that God is so weak? <br />In reality the God shown in the book is not God at all, but a sort of Satan figure, an antichrist. He calls himself God, but as the angels tell us, he is not the creator. In reality, who is the creator, we learn? It is Dust. And in fact, there is a strong case for showing that Dust is God in this book (although this may seem absurd, bear with me for a while. While we think of God as singular, we think of Dust as plural. Just think of Dust as the essence of God).<br />In the book, Dust pervades the world, and is the source of the greatest joys. Out of it were all things made. So, let us assume Dust is a sort of non-personal God. In the world, it is the source of spirituality. The Church is a institiution of fanatics, a distortion of Christianity. It is the false church set up by an antichrist. <br />Now comes Christ. Who is Christ in the book? The answer is, Lyra. Her adventures have a very Christ-like feel to them: she frees the people to search for truth (Christ: 'the truth shall set you free'); she saves the world(s) from sin and fanaticism; she reaffirms the existence of love and the holiness of Dust; and she frees the dead to return to God in the world (to mingle with the Dust). <br />As for the nature of this 'god', Dust. Too often we think of God as a human, only more powerful, wise, and kindly. Why does God have to be of this type? Can't God be a spirituality, a consciousness, a great and holy essence, that fills the world and clusters around those beings that are conscious? The history of our world, as Serafina Pekkala puts it, is &quot;one long struggle between those who want you to obey and submit, and those who want you to stand tall and think&quot;. Only, the Church that we have viewed as Christianity had become corrupted by lesser men only a few hundred years after Christ. Those who are truly spiritual and call themselves Christian will find that they need not be tied down to the Bible always, and that consciousness is the greatest gift of all. Holiness is in thought, not in repeating words mindlessly. And this book is truly great. It reveals to us these values, and it awes us. Truly a book for the ages.
0399146253|4.0|I HAVE BEEN A FAITHFUL READER OF CORNWELL SINCE THE BEGINNING.  I WAS THRILLED TO SEE ANOTHER SCARPETTA BOOK.  I JUST LOVED THE REVAMPING OF ALL THE OLD STORIES AND THE WAY SHE TIED IT TOGETHER KEPT ME ON THE EDGE.  I JUST WISH THE ENDING WASN'T RUSHED.  THE BUILDUP WAS GREAT, BUT I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED AT THE LAST 4 CHAPTERS.  I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT LIES AHEAD FOR KAY, LUCY AND ESPECIALLY MARINO.  KEEP THEM COMING.
0553106635|4.0|A Storm of Swords is undoubtedly the best 'epic' fantasy out on the market. Although I would say its a bit lower than the previous two, it is truly some good fantasy writing. The series is almost a classic.<br />I really like Martin's characters (or most of them anyway). They are well-portrayed and diverse; however I was struck by the lack of a real Hero, as such. While I don't want some perfect hardly mortal character, I wish there was a truly admirable character. This is a personal quibble, however, and he has plenty of time to fix it.<br />The book is, if anything, exciting throughout. The battles, though grim, are tense and very well-drawn. A few problems are there here as well, however. The book has less plot and more fighting than the previous books, and the sex, although rare, is crudely depicted. Also the book is more than a little tragic. Tons of people die, in my opinion a little too many, and the overll outlook is about the most depressing fantasy I've read. The series is also moving to less fantasy, more fighting.<br />Nonetheless, any fan of the series would pick these up. Thrilling and involving, they hardly ever stagnate and definitely sweep you up. Forget Wheel of Time, the Wheel that hasn't turned in 4 books. Forget Sword of Truth. Looking for a good fantasy novel? I suggest you try this series.
B000051VWW|5.0|Sade has done it again.  The only thing I hate about this latest offering is that it took so long.  The title track &quot;Lovers Rock&quot; is exactly what Sade fans around the world have come to love about her music - sweet, sultry, and oh so smooth.
0780631684|4.0|There are two types of scary movies.  The first is all about giving you a creepy feeling. The second is all about grossing you out.  While some may prefer the latter it is the first that really sticks with you and Final Destinationdoes just that.  The entire premise is creepy and thought provoking.  Is there really a plan for all of us?  Is our time so definite?  Will I die only when this other guy dies first?  Who is that guy?  These are all questions that you will eventually be asking yourself throughout the movie and still be asking yourself days later.<br /><br />If you are at all like me and are mildly squeamish at the sight of prolonged death and torture sequences then be forewarned.  There are two intense death scenes that left me gripping my blanket and clenching my teeth.<br /><br />It is untrue to classify this with any other teen-bopper movie since one thing was missing, a blatant onscreen romance between the lead character and a distressed female or vice versa.  While there was onscreen attraction it never evolved into anything physical and kept the credibility of movie intact.  If you have seen the DVD version of the movie and have played the deleted scenes, you have seen how the movie would have been completely destroyed.<br /><br />Overall I am pleased at how this movie made me feel during and afterward.  This DVD, with all the extras (deleted scenes, commentary, games and more) and great transfer should definitely me included in your library.

B000006OS2|1.0|The movie is good if not great but the problem was on the GoodTimes video transfer.  The quality of the movie in the transfer was horrible.  At times the picture was ok, but most of the time is was fuzzy and the soundtrack lagged some.   I also have the John Wayne movie &quot;El Dorado&quot; on DVD but not a GoodTimes rendition and the quality of that DVD is excellent.  While I recommend the movie McLintock I do not recommend this GoodTimes version.  Do not waste the money on this one.

B00003CX7L|5.0|The animation in the second Toy Story movie is even better than the first. When the toy repair man comes to visit, I was amazed at the animation of the tool box. I want one of those! Such a pitty it is only available in animation land.<br /><br />I love the way the toys all try to take care of each other and stick together. There are so many funny things in this movie. Adults might be the only ones to catch onto some of the jokes. I sometimes wonder if these movies are made for adults or children. Perhaps it is the child in all of us that loves animation. You will think of toys differently or perhaps remember how you thought of them as a child.<br /><br />In the second movie, Cowboy Woody is all ready to go off to Cowboy camp when his arm is torn and he is left on the shelf. Soon thereafter he \\"hilariously\\" (carried by the very adorable dog) ends up in the yard sale where a toy collector discovers him. Soon some of the toys decide to rescue him. Through some great detective work they figure out where Woody is. The problem is that Woody feels sorry for Jessie who is scared to go back into the box until another Woody can be found. The Cowboy toys are all in a set, which is about to be shipped off to Japan. Without Woody, the set is not complete.<br /><br />As a fan of Tom Hanks, I love that he is the voice for Cowboy Woody. The Cowgirl Jessie is just so animated...to put it mildly. She is very enthusiastic! All the voice casting is perfect. Buzz Lightyear is of course the tough guy who is going to save the world. Mr. Potato Head is so cute. All the toys are animated to their full potential. I thought the horse was absolutely the best toy and really took on a personality. It reminded me more of a dog than a horse. Simply amazing computer animation and a must see!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
B000051VWW|5.0|In my opinion, there are very few artists out there who, when they don't release a new album in 8 years, leave their many fans starving for more.  Sade Adu is one of those artists.  What's more, no one else out there has created and owned his/her own sound and style more distinctly than Sade. Ironically, there is such a hidden and private quality about her that makes her music that much more meaningful.  Her new LOVERS ROCK album is, in one word, a dream. There is nothing worse than an album that only has two or three good songs.  With LOVERS ROCK, just pop it in and relax.
B00003W8NM|5.0|1999 was the best year for movies in a long time.  We had 'The Sixth Sense', 'The Matrix', 'Being John Malkovich', and the best of them all, 'Fight Club'.  'Fight Club' is 'Rebel Without a Cause' for the 90s.  It's a warning, as 'Rebel' was, about the coming dangers in our increasingly mass-produced, commercial society.  It's brutal, hard, violent, and excrutiatingly enjoyable to watch.  Norton and Pitt make a great team, bouncing dialogue off each other as the situation progresses from depressing to outright absurd and dangerous.  The cinematography is dark and moody with odd flashes of neon creating a mood that still has gone from my mind.  The sets, subtle computer animation, and brilliant editing combine to create a masterfully produced picture.<br />Unfortunately, it appears as though a majority of the public will not get the inherent warning.  Some will view it as a cool tribute to violence, and others as a vulgar celebration of male aggression.  Either way, it has gotten notice.<br />The DVD includes some rather interesting extras.  I especially enjoyed the special effects documentaries.<br />And another thing, as fitting to the great movies of 99, 'Fight Club' has an ending that is so bizarre, so random, that I found it wholely inspiring as well as unnerving.  Thank you, Freud.
B00004XONN|4.0|I dunno if I love this CD quite as much as OK Computer or the Bends...but as every good band should, their sound has evolved.  There are different elements to this album than their previous releases...   A little more &quot;improvisation&quot; (it's hard to call it that when it's a studio album!). A little more &quot;experimentation&quot;, some John Zorn type random horn action &amp; a little bit of Brian Eno atmospheric landscaping.  Even a track in which I could swear Richard D. James (Aphex Twin) must've been in the studio with them (but I checked the liner notes and, no, he wasn't). I give it 4 stars because the impact of this CD won't be nearly as great as OK Computer. Radiohead made their mark with it's previous release, now it seems like they've reached that &quot;comfortable place&quot; which leaves them to experiment more freely. It's definitely a CD worth owning, but it doesn't have quite the effect on me that their two previous albums has on me. Maybe because this CD isn't like a melancholic epic  droning 20,000 leagues under the sea......
B00004ZAV3|5.0|An absolutely excellent CD! It is also an eye-opener to see not one selection from either &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; or &quot;The White Album&quot;, arguably two of the Fab Four's best albums. Regardless, a wonderful must-have disk, perfect to stick in the CD player on long road trips. Enjoy! I know I will.
B000051VWW|5.0|Most artists have to change their image or their sound to remain successful.  Not Sade.  After 8 long years, Sade delivers her fans the same smooth sound that made her popular in years past.  The thing about Sade's music is that it is timeless and does not conform to current trends.<br />&quot;Lovers Rock&quot; has no disappointments on it.  It sounds a little more accoustic and more personal than on previous albums.  Much of the album is driven with just a simple guitar.  But also present is the innovative sounds of Sade's backing band, Sweetback.  The combination of the two makes for a very satisfying listen.  This one will probably sell through the roof during the holidays!
B00000IPAX|4.0|Alright...we all know it, even though some of us deny it. Blink 182 is the most sold out poppy (punk?) band ever. But even though it pisses me off to see a bunch of girls only liking them for 2 songs and cause &quot;they're cuties&quot;, it's still a good cd. I was seriously skeptical, but even though P.W. is better, this is still pretty good.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|An essential for every music lover's collection.  Having been born too late to enjoy the Beatles in their heyday - and unwilling to share my parents' enthusiasm for them growing up - I decided it was time to take the plunge and add a Beatles CD to my music library.  All the greats are here and a few I wasn't familiar with.  This compilation is proof that they were ahead of the game. Their music is truly timeless.
B000002UZ6|4.0|This disc focusses on the 1980's when Tina was signed to Capitol records. It was a good greatest hits compilation in 1991, but she has scored so many hits ( especially in Europe ) since then that it really is time for a follow up.

B000002KKC|5.0|Tusk is undoubtably Fleetwood Mac's most controversial record. That very reason is why I put off buying it for years. I should have never listened to what the media said about this album. It is true, the band's sound is much different from the previous &quot;Rumours&quot; album, but in my opinion they have a much more refined and mature sound on this record. This is the Buckingham, Nicks, McVie, Fleetwood, and McVie line-up's third record, and the band has all truly found their niches. The vocals are georgeous. Some of Stevie Nicks best songs are on this record in my opinion, notably &quot;Sisters of the Moon&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Child.&quot; In my opinion, this is Fleetwood Mac's creative pinnacle. If you are a true Fleetwood Mac lover, &quot;Tusk&quot; is a must-have!
076790382X|4.0|Bill Bryson can be a curmudgeon. A very funny curmudgeon. This book is a collection of columns he wrote for a British publication over the course of a year. Collected here, they contain the experiences of a person returning to their homeland after 20 years and reacquainting himself. As mentioned by previous reviewers, a couple of the columns seem as if he was rushed (although I found the tax column funny), but many of them are spot-on. Many column subjects are about things Americans like to remember fondly - diners, drive-in movie theatres, the outdoors, and are therefore touching. Others are just plain hilarious. When he's in the 'zone', Bill Bryson is among the funniest authors alive. If you've read a column or any previous books by Bryson and slightly enjoyed it, there will be something here for you. Keep in mind that it is a collection of essays written over the course of one year, so a couple may not sway you, but overall this collection is definitely a keeper!

We eventually acquired another copy, and both are well-worn. My older daughter is now almost 5, and she reads the book to her 15-month-old sister. If we ask my younger daughter what the cow says, she can tell us, &quot;Moo!&quot; and so on. One day she picked up a diaper with a picture of pigs on the tab, and when I asked her what they were, she answered, &quot;La la!&quot; This is one to read over and over!

I really enjoyed watching it and give it four and a half stars for the following reasons: the acting is subtle and believable; the characters play against type and allow for some plot twists and character development beyond racial, ethnic and gender lines; (one mustn't assume anything about these characters, each one has his/her own story, which is usually told gently, through the emergence of each situation); the film is scary without being over-the-top Hollywood; the film, from beginning to end, creates this believable alternate reality, ie: the film doesn't go out of its way to over-explain or over-dramatize the situation the characters find themselves in, it is just portrayed in such a way that the viewer finds this version of the future to be plausible, as opposed to, say, The Fifth Element, which, though a great movie, was kind of fantastical. This film was more like Aliens in that its portrayal of space/the future seemed possible/believable. Finally, the end is &quot;realistic&quot; and doesn't try to tie up every loose end. It is a story with lots of human drama and emotion, and the characters are not all good or evil, nor are they all necessarily redeemed, at least entirely. Although as far as I can tell, these actors were mostly unknowns (with the exception of Radha Mitchell's appearance in High Art and Vin Diesel's in Saving Private Ryan), I really enjoyed their performances and look forward to seeing them in other projects. <br />The cinematography of this film is really interesting, especially in the first half or so. It set the mood and tone for the film really well, and also lent a quiet &quot;otherness&quot; to its reality. I also love that the film doesn't initially fit neatly into a cookie-cutter fit with its title. It makes you wonder what will happen next, and how things fit together. This is one of many 'ambiguities' in the film, and I think that all of its ambiguities, taken together, make it a richer, more complex film. Because I think knowing too much about the plot could ruin some of the film's suspense/mystery, I won't give anything away here. Suffice to say that I highly recommend this film to intelligent movie buffs who appreciate a good sci-fi flick. This is a sleeper of a film which is deserving of more publicity than it has gotten. The film was just as interesting to the girls I watched it with as to the guys. In fact, there seemed to be some feminist elements in the film. I was happily surprised to find that in a sci-fi drama. The pace is a bit slow, but I don't think the film would be the same without it. Such a pace can go a long way in creating, and preserving, true suspense.
B000002LCE|3.0|Hey man I dig Dio. Loved him in Sabbath, loved him in Rainbow, and loved him on his own. This album goes a little overboard though. Last in Line and Holy Diver were great albums, but this one doesn't quite stand up to those two. Most Dio fans will agree that Ronnie James has a one track mind. Very few of his songs DON'T contain the following words - Magic, Rainbow, Dark, Heart, or Evil. But hey, that's why we listen to him.<br />Best tunes are 'Fools sailed Away' and 'Could of been a Dreamer'. The guitar riff on 'Sunset SuperMan' is amazing, but the lyrics are so stupid they take away from it. I could see the idea behind the tune, but I think he should have reworked it before releasing it as it was.
0684853523|5.0|This book might not be what you expect -- the first half is a mini-autobiography and the last chapter is a retelling of his car accident.  Not normally fodder for a book on writing.  But it's all entertaining.  I'm not a professional writer, and based on King's fairly blatant comments I probably never will be, but I was entertained hearing it from one of my favorite authors.  It was nice to see him confirm things I'd always liked (the character development is most important).  When he's got something negative to say, he pulls no punches.  Adverbs suck.  He gives plenty of examples of good sentences, as well as plenty of bad ones -- citing the source at each turn, as all good writers should do (watch out Bridges of Madison County and Danielle Steele!). How useful is it to a writer?  I expect that a large portion of what he's saying has been said.  Read alot.  Write alot.  Repeat.  Get rejected, learn from the experience, get accepted.  And so on.  It's the style with which he says it.  He doesn't just say &quot;You'll get rejected&quot;, he tells stories about personal rejections in his early days.  That's what makes it good.
0385495323|5.0|An excellent introduction to the world of cryptography.  It shows not only the methods cryptography but also the reasons why they were so important.  Singh brings out the hidden history of cryptographers and the politics that have surrounded them.  The first chapter with Mary, Queen of Scots demonstrates the power of cryptography to save or take lives.  The book demonstrates the power of secrets and how cyphers have kept secrets beyond the lifetime of the cryptographers.<br />The book is an easy to read history of cryptography from monoalphabetic cyphers to modern cyphers like PGP.  It's an written in a style that accessible to people with little to background in cryptography.  _The Code Book_ is an excellent tribute to the men and women who have contributed to the art of cryptography over the centuries, and the genius it has taken to make and break their cyphers.
B00004YA66|1.0|This is another example of Hollywood at its worst. The premise is just hard to swallow. The dialogues and story all conspire to make a joke of a movie. You have turn off your brain to see this one. It is rather pathetic.
B00004YA66|5.0|This is a complex movie, slow-moving in places, which bears careful attention to dialog and details, otherwise you'll be lost -- and you may well still feel lost in places on a first viewing.  I have seen it twice and still found myself adrift from time to time.  But the premise is so fascinating - parallel time, time paradoxes and so forth, and the execution and acting are so adept, that after a while the film does grab the viewer and doesn't let go.  Spending time with it is well worth the effort.<br />A friend of mine, a mystery film aficionado, stated flatly after her first viewing that &quot;Frequency&quot; is the best mystery film she has ever seen.  This is a lady who grooves on Hitchcock, Agatha Christie, Hercule Poirot and the like and who usually disdains science fiction.  High praise for &quot;Frequency&quot; indeed.<br />I could not get into some of the special features on the DVD.  I don't know if the problem was with the DVD itself or my DVD player.  I wonder if others have had a similar problem.
6304994540|5.0|The plot of this Raymond Chandler-esque comedy crime caper from the Coen Brothers pivots around a case of mistaken identity complicated by extortion, double-crosses, deception, embezzlement, sex, pot, and gallons of White Russians (made with fresh cream, please).<br />In 1991, unemployed '60s refugee Jeff &quot;The Dude&quot; Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) grooves into his laid-back Los Angeles lifestyle. One of the laziest men in LA, he enjoys hanging with his bowling buddies, pompous security-store owner Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and mild-mannered ex-surfer Donny (Steve Buscemi).<br />However, the Dude's life takes an alternate route the afternoon two goons break into his threadbare Venice, California, bungalow, rough him up, and urinate on his living room rug. Why? Because Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara) is owed money by the wife of a certain Jeff Lebowski. However, the goons grabbed the wrong Jeff Lebowski. With the right info, they would have invaded the home of philanthropic Pasadena millionaire Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston).<br />The Dude looks up his wealthy namesake, manages to get a replacement for his rug, and meets the millionaire's sexy young wife Bunny (Tara Reid). Later, Jeffrey (&quot;The Big&quot;) Lebowski calls in the Dude to deliver a $1 million ransom for the return of his kidnapped wife. Fine -- except that Walter intrudes and botches the ransom drop.<br />As events unravel, the Dude gets caught up in the schemes of Lebowski's daughter, erotic artist Maude (Julianne Moore), encounters both cops and bad guys, and drifts through an elaborate bowling fantasy sequence titled Gutterballs. The soundtrack includes Bob Dylan, Yma Sumac, Moondog, Captain Beefheart, and the Sons of the Pioneers.<br />A quirky flick not to be missed.
0553106635|5.0|Let's start off by saying that this book is not your normal fantasy story with happy endings.  Nothing happens as expected.  I've been a fantasy fan for over 24 years.  No author puts a story together like Mr. Martin.  I've read Tolkien, Eddings, Goodkind, Jordan, Salvatore, and too many more to name.  No one out there on the market today keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting more.  After reading Clash of kings, I thought the story just couldn't get any better.  Boy was I wrong.  A Storm of Swords is what fantasy is about.  This isn't your run of the mill swords &amp; sorcery type story.  It's full of plots and people.  There is no real good and evil.  If his books stay this good, I'll be waiting impatiently for a Dance of Dragon.
0380730405|5.0|I found this book in a box (a jumble) of books my Mother bought at a garage sale and had never heard of it. Several years went by before I finally picked it up. I won't go into any detail about the plot because what you don't read of it in the other reviews, you will want to discover for yourself if you will just read the first few haunting paragraphs! For by then I was in-escapably emersed in the authers web! Sufice it to say that I found myself truly wishing I had picked it up much sooner. I had had a treasure on the shelf and hadn't even known it. I only came to realize the height of celebrity the book had raised long after reading it. I still havn't seen the movie, but plan to do so soon
B00003CXE7|5.0|I saw this movie not knowing what to expect... A remake of a classic is almost always a disappointment.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that this Gladiator stands on its own two feet quite well.  Russell Crowe is appropriately meloncholy, and you can really cheer for his battle to regain the dignity taken from him.<br />This movie may seem long by minutes, but the time flies.  You'll be at the edge of your seat wondering how the players will resolve their conflicts until the last bittersweet moment.  Definitely one of the best written movies of the year.  <br />ONE NOTE:  There are some scenes during the gladiator matches that may make some squeamish, thought the director and editor have kept the gore to a minimum.
B00004ZB9D|2.0|Personally, I don't own this album and would never condone actually shelling out the cash for an album as simple as this, but if you like standard modern pop/rock, this is one of the better choices out there.  His earlier stuff is clearly where his strengths lie, and until Kravitz gets out of this string of stuff that has absolutely failed (his cover of American Woman is abyssmal, and while Fly Away rocks, a lot of the other songs off that album were repetitive and dull, not to mention the horribly bland Again which really makes you wonder why it is on any album at all), I suggest biding your time with those earlier albums, if any of his stuff at all.  His songs really don't develop much beyond the standard verse/chorus blah of pop, and his guitar prowess (which I do question) is certainly not a focal point of this album in any way.
6300214028|4.0|Few filmmakers other than Warren Beatty would have had the courage and vision to fashion an epic film from the life of famed American Communist John Reed (who, outside of labor leader Eugene V. Debs, is the only US citizen buried in the Kremlin).<br />That Reds falls a bit short of its promise should not be held against it; the film is a remarkable effort to humanize a political movement that has previously been depicted on screen in a series of unsubtle and prejudicial broad strokes.<br />The film begins in 1915, when Reed (Beatty) makes the acquaintance of married Portland journalist Louise Bryant (Diane Keaton). So persuasive is Reed's point of view--and so charismatic is Reed himself-- that Louise kicks over the traces and joins Reed and his fellow radicals.<br />Among the famous personages depicted herein are Emma Goldman (Maureen Stapleton), Eugene O'Neill (Jack Nicholson) and Max Eastman (Richard Herrmann). The second half of this 200-minute film merely skims through the years when Reed, now a Russian resident, becomes disillusioned by the harsh realities of Bolshevism.<br />The scenes in which a solitary Louise Bryant trudges across the Russian countryside to be reunited with Reed don't work as well as intended, though the couple's train-station embrace is as effective as anything seen in such previous films as Doctor Zhivago and Since You Went Away. Despite the celebrity line-up of real-life &quot;witnesses&quot; to the events depicted in the film (ranging from novelist Henry Miller to comedian George Jessel!), historians took Reds to task for its oversimplification of events and its laundering of the notoriously promiscuous Louise Bryant.<br />Still, Reds is a towering achievement, and we can be grateful indeed that Warren Beatty was willing to fly in the face of timorous Hollywood conservatism to get it made.
0060931671|5.0|If you've always heard the term postmodern and wondered what it meant this book is for you. But, let me warn you, this book is definately not for everyone, the plot is unique to say the least, and the characters are not what you will find in most novels, but then again, neither is the intellectual stimulation. In little over 100 pages, Thomas Pynchon has written an accessibly managable introduction to postmodern literature. Although this book is rather dense, and is filled with obscure facts and information from seemingly every conceivable specialty of knowledge, it is an enjoyable way to aquaint oneself  with one of the most misunderstood genres of modern literature. Just be sure to keep a dictionary, encyclopedia and sourcebook to anarchism handy. The plot revolves around the exciting and often bizarre experiences and wanderings of Oedipa Maas, as she embarks upon a surrealistic journey into the unfamiliar techno-industrial pop culture wasteland of San Narcisco and surrounding counties, after being named executor of an ex-lovers will. In her madcap adventures she uncovers a bizzaire world where everything that she has ever learned crumbles in the face of absurdity and falls into question. It is a world where nazi doctors, secret societies, papal misdeeds, anarchist dreamers, narcicistic ex-child stars, and deranged outcasts all come out of the shadows to invade the &quot;typical&quot; suburban landscape of an average American housewife. This book is concerned with uncovering the realities, or lack thereof, that most people would want to stay hidden, or at the least forgotton. It is about questioning the assumptions that we all hold dear, even if it means coming to terms with a world that is without meaning, without order, and most of all without a coherent design. This is a novel with many questions to be answered, so if you welcome intellectual challenge and desire obscure knowledge this book will certainly not dissappoint. And if you don't quite understand it read it again...
B00000IAU3|4.0|Insomnia bothering you?  You'll never have a problem again after paying $ for this CD.  No Angel by Dido is perfect for relaxing.  Featuring songs such as; Here With Me, All You Want, and Thank You, her soothing lyrics will reach the depths of your soul.  Ignored by record labels in her home country Dido looked abroad to gain attention.  Due to the fabulous taste of the producers on the WB show Roswell her career began to soar.  Then soon after even Eminem was using her voice (Stan).  Dido's scintillating blend of music not only shows high class but also tantalizing style.  Still early in her career already she is being compared to singers like Sarah Mclaughlan to Jewel.  Watch out ladies this girl is sure to be some fast competition.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|If you're a diehard Beatles fan, there's no real reason to buy this, but you must.  Of course there are some great songs missing (and why oh why did The Beatles insist on reissuing the Red and Blue albums in their original forms, with the ~60-minute Red album spread across two CDs, while here they cram almost 80 minutes on one?), and despite all the bally-hoo about these being the #1 songs, we are not hearing them in their original single mixes that actually did go to #1.  I'm tired of keeping around my out-of-print three-inch CD singles from the '80's that feature the original mixes, and this CD just makes me want to get a CD burner so I can roll my own.  The booklet features photos of many different sleeves for each of the singles, with the Richard Avedon photos on the back cover (somewhere I had been led to believe that there would be a fold-out poster of these, or something, but it's not there in my copy).  This is probably the most disappointing Beatles CD release ever, from this fan's perspective. Give me a remastered &quot;Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot;!
B00003CXDG|5.0|As you can see, I have rated this movie 5 stars and give it the award for &quot;Best of the Year.&quot;<br />I saw this movie when it first came out in theatres and couldn't wait til I could finally own it myself.  I bought it and absolutely loved it.  I watch it again and again.  Tom Cruise plays one of his best acting roles ever in Mission Impossible 2 playing the role as &quot;the good guy&quot; against &quot;the bad guys&quot; in this action packed thriller.<br />I was just blown away from the special effects and time the producers put into this film to create such a great movie.  The fight scenes are phenomenal and as real as you can get them, the explosions are as great as you can ever see, and the gunshots and wounds are so life-like.  Sometimes I feel like I'm actually there.<br />Tom Cruise probably already knows that he did an awesome job but he should be congradulated once again by a long-time fan.  He got into his character so much in the movie that I just couldn't believe that it was him.<br />I honestly have to say that any action movie fans or just fans of great movies should really check this one out.  Not only does it feature a great cast and great crew, but it also features spectacular special affects and fight scenes.<br />&quot;Mission Impossible 2&quot; is the most &quot;real&quot; movie that I have ever seen.  Its length is perfect and they don't cut anything out that I might have wanted to see.  Everything about this movie is just wonderful and anyone of any age should see this movie.<br />Honestly folks, you are gonna love it.<br />Thanks for reading my review and have a nice day!
0684833395|3.0|I only have one word for this book, confusing.  The novel has a great story line, and is rather funny, but I suggest making a time-line to help you understand whether you're in the past or present.  The two best ways of telling this are by the number of missions that must be completed before coming home and when there is someone, who died earlier in the novel, walking around.  I would also like to add that there are not much war scenes (which is good for me, because I don't like war novels).
B00004YZFR|5.0|....in the World's greatest Rock n' Roll Movie!!...     Anyone who grew up in the vicinity of 1969 will view &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; as a masterpiece in rock n' roll cinema.  This film pretty much sums up the Flower-Power drugged out hippie world of the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco of the 60's.  It's beautiful and frightning at the same time.  Mick &amp; the boys are in top flamboyant form, belting out song after song, with help from Tina Turner, The Plane, and more.  This is what &quot;Sex, Drugs, &amp; Rock n' Roll&quot; is all about!  The illision that you can control a crowd of thousands with 'Peace n' Love&quot; is so obvious here.  &quot;Tune in, Turn on, &amp; Drop out&quot; was never more evident than here.    I love this movie.       Too young to remember the 60's? See this movie to find out first hand.<br />Peace Brother...
630587493X|4.0|I was surprised that this was billed as a comedy, instead of a drama. I would also think that most children watching this film will be bored and confused with the subject matter. Although it is a clean family movie, the topics covered (i.e. euthanasia, discrimination, immortality, etc.) are most definitely adult.<br />I very much enjoyed the human story about a robot's search for meaning and humanity. This is a thought provoking and touching drama which contemplates very complex issues in a highly entertaining manner. It is not a real comedy nor is it for the very young. This is a good film and I recommend it.
B000003S2M|5.0|I spin this CD frequently, mostly on evenings as I drift into the subtle world.  <br />I frequented the foggy environs of San Francisco when this was first released on LP, so perhaps that history imprinted alongside the music.  In any event, PLATEAUX gets my highest recommendation as background music to loosen up and clarify consciousness.  The melodies have a Satie-ish quality, and everything seems diffused though a cold, shimmering golden light.<br />Anyone who likes Cosma's 'Promenade Sentimentale' from the DIVA soundtrack on DRG/Ryko will want this collection of evocative soundscapes.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I am sure any normal human being will be familiar with most if not all of the tracks on this album so there is no risk in purchasing it. You know what to expect... some of the greatest music of our time and rightly all number ones. Sure it may not include all your favourite songs or have the flow of a proper album, but that is not what it is about. It is supposed to celebrate how these 4 lads from Liverpool went on to hit the top of the charts so many times both in the UK and US, despite changing their music style so much over the years. I took pride in buying my copy in the city were it all began and all of us Liverpudlians take pride in their achievements. The Beatles... No 1 forever!
B00004XONN|5.0|&quot;in a word... breathtaking&quot;
B00004TRD8|4.0|Linda Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor, now a single mother to rebellious teen John Connor. Having been informed by a time-traveling soldier in the first film that John will one day grow up to become humanity's savior from a computer-controlled Armageddon, Sarah has responded by becoming a muscle-bound she-warrior bent on educating John in survival tactics and battle strategies. Her ranting about mankind's future has landed Sarah in an insane asylum and John in the foster care system. The rebellious John has responded to his situation by getting into scrapes with the law. When a new and improved Terminator android called the T-1000 arrives from the future to eliminate John, an older model T-800 played by Schwarzenegger who is sent to protect the boy. The T-1000, however, has the ability to morph itself into any shape it desires, allowing it chameleon-like powers and near indestructibility. The T-800 saves John's life and helps breaks Sarah out of the institution. Staying only one step ahead of the dogged T-1000, Sarah leads her son and the T-800 to the headquarters of Cyberdyne Systems, the company that will invent a robotic intelligence that will eventually take over the world. There, they attempt to convince inventor Miles Dyson to help them stop the future from ever occurring by destroying his work. Dyson sacrifices himself in an explosion to save the world, leading to a final showdown between the two.
B000002KYK|3.0|Well, we put up with this one because it was the only thing available for over ten years since Vangelis withheld his original tapes from Warners for release in '82 upon the film's release (he felt his music had saturated the market pursuant to 'Chariots').<br />The best one can say is that the 'Love Theme', as rendered by saxman Tom Scott, rates up there with his cover of 'Theme from Taxi Driver', and Chuck Findley's trumpet on 'Blade Runner Blues' does have its charms (but it by no means achieves the timeless bliss of the original synth version ).  The version here of 'Memories of Green' is rather leaden.
B00004XQP4|3.0|Before I launch into my critical and unfair opinion, I just want to state that this album is excellent. Very creative, thoughtful and clever lyrics, and masterful musicianship. However, for any other band this would get 5 stars - yet, for the 18 + platinum punk group Green Day, I'm rather ashamed. For me, personally, I adored the fast-paced, riviting and moving album &quot;dookie&quot;. Green Day gave a display of cartoonish, growing-up life in the Bay Area. Nimrod also made you launch more and more into the punk genre and adore it. There are decent and even very good songs on this record, but not like their earlier productions. I mean, this has a POLKA song on it!! That's why it only gets three stars. The first 10 songs wear off after a while, &quot;minority&quot; gets old, and the last song also tires after a while. However, &quot;Macy's Day Parade&quot; is an incredible song. A &quot;Time Of Your Life&quot; ballad-like song, very excellent with the potential to be a top song. Overall, I guess I just miss the crazy, wonderful feeling that Dookie gave off. There's no &quot;when i come around&quot;, &quot;longview&quot;, or &quot;having a blast&quot; on this album. If you have an option of dookie or warning .. go for dookie. If you have an option of nevermind or warning ... go for nevermind. If you have an option of phil collins or warning .. go for warning.
6305807086|5.0|I was expecting this to be a comedy and had to rethink my expectations when I realized it wasn't. It has comedic elements - a lot of them - and there's no problem going along with the antics: the portal into Malkovich's brain, the 7 1/2 floor (an oppressive work place if ever there was), the eccentric characters and the whimsical insanity of it all. Then the sneaky thing turns and bites, the comedic trance is broken, and you're watching an acid commentary on identity. All the performances are done well, especially John Malkovich's portrayal of himself. The others, John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener, manage terrifically  with their roles. Their characters are unappealing, but that's the way it was meant to be. I think they represent every person who ever wished to be somebody else, or that the person they were with was someone else. Personally, I was touched by poor Lottie's lament that she wanted to be a man, with power. Yeah, Lottie, you're not alone. Anyway, it does not have a happy or upbeat ending, for how can it, when we are never happy with who we are?
B00003CX8I|5.0|The best inside joke of the entire movie right there. It's genius. I saw this three times during the flight from Miami to Vienna (possible with Lauda Air, my new fave airline), once without sound, and I still loved it. What can I say? Genius.<br />The action really begins in some remote area of northern Alberta, where we meet the two real focuses of the movie- the teenage Rogue (a mutant with the uncontrollable ability to drain the energy of others) and the brooding Wolverine, whose skeleton is made up of a near-indestructable metal called adamantine (or some such word). Then the bad guys show up and the party starts. Heartstopping action all the way through.<br />The only beef I have about this film (besides the length, which was short- *sequel, sequel, sequel*) is the fried toad line (others who have seen the movie will know what I'm talking about). It was supposed to be menacing, but really it added a cheese factor to the entire movie which I'd ignored until then. All in all, a brilliant film, with an especially brilliant portrayal of Wolverine by Hugh Jackman.
B000051VWW|5.0|Its been a long time, long time coming.  It was worth the wait.  Her first single &quot;By Your Side&quot; is a great cut. Pop the CD in and listen to tracks like &quot;Somebody Already Broke my Heart&quot;, &quot;Flow&quot; &quot;All About Our Love&quot; and heck the WHOLE CD is nice!!!!!!  What a mellow and romantic CD.  She takes me to a place thats been missing in the music industry, my soul.  Her lyrics are always unforgettable and she keeps the consistency.  Welcome back Sade!!!
B00000F1D3|1.0|This album is so incredibly trite, and horrific musically, lyrically, and vocally...which makes me wonder...if Cher has no output lyrically, musically, or vocally (It's called a vocoder)..why is her name on this album.  For a great techno-pop album buy Madonna's &quot;Music.&quot;
0399146253|4.0|Oh, common. At least it's Cornwell. This book might not compare favorably to the pace and action of the other Scarpetta books, but at least it's well written (compared, say, to Syndey Sheldon). So Patricia Cornwell tried something new -- so what. Scarpetta's adventures were beginning to run together in my mind anyway, and this book gives a clean transition to Scarpetta's new career in the big apple. Loyal Cornwell fans will find the goodness in The Last Precinct (it is there) and disregard the grumblings of people who are upset by change.
079074404X|5.0|Considering when this movie was released, it HAS to be rated one of the most powerful and intruiging sci-fi movies ever produced. The story line seems plausible and is enchanting (based on a well-known play), the acting splendid, and the special effects outstanding! And to view the video in stereo is the frosting on the cake. I first saw this movie in the theatre back in '56 or '57 when it came out, but with the new sound effects, the  audio is amazing.  The 'music score' for this production of course were the tonalities of the prototype of what would later be known as the Moog Synthesizer.  And it's effect is superb.  When I first saw this movie, I couldn't believe what I had just seen, and that wonder has remained with me ever since.  And it's amusing to see such celebraties as Leslie Nielsen, Anne Francis, Warren Stevens et al when they were 'no-names', just beginning their acting careers.  Anyone who is a sci-fi nut HAS to own this for  their collection.  I don't know if this movie is available in the DVD format, but if it is, it should be 'out of this world'.
0679720200|5.0|The Stranger was the first novel of Camus' labeled &quot;absurd,&quot; and it                   defines Camus for most Americans. The plot is quite simple, with                   none of the diversions common in popular literature. The main                   character is not a hero, has no &quot;true&quot; love affair and the pursuit of                   money and power never enters the story. The Stranger is an honest                   atheist, waiting for life to happen.<br />                  The title l'Etranger, has been poorly translated. The U.S. title, The                   Stranger, implies that the main character, Meursault, has been                   viewed as a &quot;strange&quot; or &quot;odd&quot; person for some time. The other                   possible meaning is that no one knows him. Meursault is a stranger                   even to those who think they know him. These definitions do not                   seem adequate. The U.K. title, The Outsider, only serves to confuse                   readers even more.<br />                  Meursault is the archetype of a middle-class man. He works as a                   clerk, rents an apartment and draws no attention to himself. He is, if                   anything, very ordinary. Meusault might even be boring. He lacks                   deep convictions and passion. If he is estranged from any aspect of                   French society, it is religion--he does not believe in the symbols                   and the rituals of faith.<br />                  Estranged? &quot;Cela m'est égal.&quot;<br />                  Along with the title, Camus took care in naming the main character.                   Meursault's name is symbolic of the Mediteranean sea. Mer mean                   &quot;sea&quot; and soliel is French for &quot;sun.&quot; The sea and the sun meet at the                   beach, where Meursault's defining actions occur.<br />                  Meusault is an anti-hero. His only redeeming quality is his honesty,                   no matter how absurd. In existential terms, he is &quot;authentic&quot; to                   himself. Meusault does not believe in God, but he cannot lie                   because he is true to himself. This inability to falsify empathy                   ultimately condemns him. Meursault has faith only in what he,                   himself, can see or experience with his other senses. He is not a                   philosopher, a theologian or a deep thinker. Meursault exists as he                   is, not trying to be anything more or less than himself.<br />                  Why did Camus' readers recognize Meursault as a plausible                   character? After two World Wars and much suffering, many people                   came to live life much as Meursault does. Or at least they tried to                   do so. These people lost the will to do more than exist. There was                   no hope and no desire. The only goal for many people was simple                   survival. Even then, the survival seemed empty and hollow. We                   learn how empty Meursault's existence is through his relationships.                   He is not close to his mother; we learn he does not cry at her                   funeral. He does not seem close to his lover, Marie Cardona. Of                   her, Meursault states, &quot;To me, she was only Marie.&quot; There is no                   passion is Meursault's words or in his life.<br />                  What sets Camus apart from many existentialists and modern                   philosophers in general is his acceptance of contradiction. Yes,                   Camus wrote, life is absurd and death renders life meaningless--for                   the individual. But mankind and its societies are larger than any one                   individual person.
0394873742|5.0|my son got this book when he was about 9 monthes old and spent hours sitting inside it looking at the pictures and by a year old could point to everything in every picture when asked to identify them. all of the richard scarry books were the greatest books for building an extensive vocabulary in him. now, at nine years, he never stops talking.
B00004TL2N|1.0|Boulez is'nt cold, really, he's just detached; and there's nothing wrong with detachment, if you're an amputee. The main problem with objective interpretation, of which so many of today's non-inspired seem very fond, is that it never allows the subject--or audience--to be involved. As written, Bruckner's Eight is a glorious cathedral, but here, forget about sentiment, personal transcendence, religious experience, finding the meaning to life, or an adventure to Valhalla, it's little more than a study in architecture.
079213690X|5.0|Braveheart is, without a doubt, the BEST movie I've ever seen.  It has the most passionate emotions I've ever seen on screen, and a fantastic Romance.  This has the best lifelike battle scenes, and a completely untouchable plot.
B000003C4K|5.0|Exodus defined a whole generation with this album. It made a great impact on the underground music scene back in the day but yet nobody seems to remember these guys. Led by two incredible guitarists, Rick Hunolt and Gary Holt, Exodus shreds through their songs with incredible speed and power. All the songs here are good to listen to, but the highlites are DELIVER US TO EVIL, A LESSON IN VIOLENCE, and the incredible AND THEN THERE WERE NONE (You gotta love that chorus). This album is one of the best debut album ever for a thrash band. Better than the ones from Megadeth, Anthrax, Slayer, and Metallica. (My opinion) The problem why they never got big is the lack of a ground breaking song such as Piece Sells (Megadeth), For Whom the Bell Tolls (Metallica), I am the Law (Anthrax), etc. All their songs are good but they miss that one song that would of put them on the map. One thing I don`t understand though is why they never got the status that Slayer got. Is it because Slayer is Satanic? Look I`m not bashing Slayer, I do have two albums from them and they`re not bad, but Exodus in my opinion is a far more superior band. This being said if you don`t have any Exodus album and you like good Thrash Metal buy this album which influenced so many and defined an entire era.
B0000508U6|5.0|There is something about Coldplay that makes them stand out from all of the other groups around at the moment.  Their sound is unique with anthems like Yellow And Trouble (my favourite) this is an album that is a must have for any fan of GOOD music.  They have the knack of writing classic tunes that are radio friendly without selling themselves out.  If this is a first atempt i would like to hear Coldplays second or third album to see if they have the same depth and maturness they have on this album.  Go out and buy it itll be worth every penny.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park is the phatist rock group around. Hardcore rock is what it's all about. Linkin Park is like a mix of Papa Roach and Filter. Thay've got the loud head-bangin' music your lookin' for plus tons of awesome digital Sound FX. This album is certainly worth spending your money on. All the songs are totally beasty so I Recomend this album to every rock fan. A word to all my peeps out there: Whassup!!!
B000001GBJ|5.0|Lush, romantic and unabashedly sentimental, &quot;Songs from a Secret Garden&quot; is music for people who want beautiful sounds in their lives. Soaring voices and lilting strings, sweet and sorrowful chords, and the soothing sounds of harp, oboe and flute all combine to make this an aural experience worthy of any collection. You'll find yourself pulling this CD out again and again.
B000002LBH|5.0|I remember when Louder Than Bombs came out my friend who had been collecting the 45's with a hefty Import price threw a hissy fit.  He blamed Morrissey.  But can you trust a guy who wrote Pack them up in different sleeves, buy both and feel deceived.  A quote that almost predicts the substandard hits and singles collections to come years later.  If you're looking for the real singles, here they are!  Throw your homework onto the fire- come out and find the one that you love Morrissey sings in Sheila Take a Bow.  This collection is a great mix of the Morrissey-Marr song pairing.  It contains one of their greatest love songs Ask.  The rocking squeal of London is one of my favorites.  While other softer songs Back to the Old House and Please, Please, Please Let Me Get What I Want remain some of their poignant best material.  If you are looking for an essential singles collection- this is it.
B00000BKI4|2.0|Lush pop arrangements and a focus on melody were what I was promised.  I was so, so eager to buy this album.  I didn't like it at first.  That's fine; I didn't like Beulah, Tom Waits, or Sleater-Kinney on first listen either. <br />After a year, I still dislike the album.  I've forced myself to listen to it, hoping I was missing something.  I don't think I am.  The melodies are just boring.  The arrangements are nice enough, but the melodies are predictable.  <br />The disc makes me wonder if this would be similar to Pink Floyd collaborating with 10,000 Maniacs.  Glih.
B000002H4Q|4.0|This album is a direct link from the previous Head On the Door.  The songs vary greatly between poppy hits, aching ballads, and Eastern-tinged trip-outs.  Yet this album finds the Cure really hitting their stride in all the above styles.  &quot;Why Can't I Be You&quot; and &quot;Just Like Heaven&quot; are great pop hits, &quot;One More Time&quot; and the title track are great painful ballads, and the rest of the album stands strong; &quot;Catch&quot; and &quot;the Perfect Girl&quot; being favorites.  This album perfected all that came before it and remains one of their best.
B00004XONN|3.0|Radiohead is a great band. In fact, there one of only a few that tries to create innovative music in a world where everyone is stuck in pop or this rock-rap stuff. However, this work falls short of excellent, and it is certainly not a classic. I hate to have to compare this to OK Computer, but it's irresistable. Radiohead has once again reinvented itself, but not to the benefit of the listener. As a work of art, it is exceptional, but very few of the songs draw the listener in like those on OK did. The best here are Optimistic, Everything in Its Right Place, and How to Disappear completely. This album lacks lyrics in general, and Yorke hides his voice behind synthesizers, his vocals being a signature part of the band are missing. And so is the guitar.  There is almost  no presence of a guitar here. I'm not saying that they have to return to the stylings of Pablo HOney, but they are a band, not a keyboard. They seem to have adopted the latter,  along with great drum beats, in place of what they once had.
B000002H70|5.0|Disintegration was a step away from some of the catchy pop on Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me back to their roots as a band with nothing but heartaches.  The songs are awash with moods of abandonment, regret, and lost youth.  The album begins with the majestic &quot;Plainsong&quot; that sets the stage for an album of introspection.  One of the singles &quot;Love Song&quot; was written as a wedding present for his wife and it remains one of their poignant best.  The single &quot;Fascination Street&quot; holds up well as does the spidery &quot;Lullaby&quot;.  If you like the darker side of the Cure, this is one of their best.
B000051VWW|5.0|Just heard the new Sade &quot;Lover's Rock&quot; CD.<br />Three words: Time Stands Still.<br />Nothing more to be said, except &quot;buy it&quot;.
B000051VWW|5.0|This album exceeds all expectations anyone might have for the Queen of Sadness and Salvation.  In a time where much of the music we have to choose from has lyrics like &quot;Baby can I lick this?&quot; or &quot;Honey can you suck that?&quot;, LOVERS ROCK brings an end to all the madness.  While King of Sorrow, Slave Song, and the title track, Lovers Rock, are like religion, the whole album is clearly divine.  Now if Anita Baker would just get in the studio...
0064407667|3.0|I bought this book expecting something darkly whimsical, something like Dahl, or Gorey, or Burton, perhaps.  I wasn't entirely impressed.  There wasn't enough whimsy for my taste, and I found the travails of the Baudelaire children not amusing but truly *depressing*.  One horrible thing after another happens to the children, and it's really not as amusing or as charming as you'd think.  As Mr. &quot;Snicket&quot; says, in the opening line of the book, &quot;If you are interested in stories with happy endings, you would be better off reading some other book.&quot;  And he's not kidding.  Another reviewer remarked on the similarity of this book to the part in Harry Potter where he lives under the stairs &quot;before the happy bit&quot;.  I have to disagree.  That was a good kind of melancholy - this is just plain awful.  I also found the vocabulary lessons on every other page to be irritating.  It was almost cute the first couple of times, but after a while, you just want to bludgeon Mr. &quot;Snicket&quot; to death with a dictionary.  I also couldn't figure out if this book was intended for children or for adults.  If it was written for children, I might question Mr. Snicket's taste - most of the adults are grotesque pedophilic monsters who constantly leer and drool over the children.  Is he writing these books as proscribed therapy as a sex-offender?  If it was written for adults, it comes off entirely too condescending and simple.  Still, it has a certain.. je ne sais quoi.  I would recommend that most people borrow this first book from a friend or the library before deciding to buy the series.  However, if you are a truly mean-spirited, black-hearted, lecherous, leering villain, I recommend you run out and buy them all today: this series was made for you!
B00004Z4WR|5.0|This movie is great!  If you're looking for action and fast cars, look no further.  I enjoyed all the chase scenes and the cars.  I love this movie!!!!!!!!!!!
B000001ESN|4.0|Gone are the side-long suites, the sci-fi babble, and the high pitched screeching.  This album, with its shorter songs, more mature lyrics and melodic hooks, set the template for Rush's output during the 80s.   The influence of the Police and other new-wave bands begins to appear in a few of the songs.  &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot; and &quot;Freewill&quot;, are among the band's best songs; they deftly merge concise songwriting with proficient musicianship.  Other highlights include the synth-drenched &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot; and the underrated semi-epic &quot;Natural Science&quot;.  This blows most other AOR albums out of the water.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I simply cherish this music. The craftsmanship of these songs are unequaled. 27 compositions that set the gold standard. To think they were a band for just seven years! Personal faves that are missing on this disc are &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;Please Please Me&quot;.
6303965415|5.0|Yet another wonderful version of a Jane Austen novel.  In response to the person who suggested that some of the Austen movies are just costume fests (Emma)I must say that the tone of the novel and film of Emma is much different than Persuasion.  Emma was written to comment on the idea of social class, is about a silly girl, and is firmly tongue in cheek.  It is a sunny novel and therefore a sunny film.  Sense and Sensibility is a darker film and more resembles the film Persuasion in tone.  The tension in S and S is how will this mother and her three daughters find happiness.  In Persuasion the tension is how will these two lovers reconcile and get back together?  As far as Wentworth appearing in a non-uniform in his first scene, why not?  It is not the captain's uniform that attracts Anne, it is the man himself.  The Navy is the only way she can keep track of him. As an American I enjoy seeing these Brit actors in other films--Amanda Root as Miss Temple in William Hurt's Jane Eyre, the brother in law in An Ideal Husband, and Ciaran Hinds in any  number of films such as The Man Who Cried (with Amanda Root.) I enjoy the work of these fine actors.   Thanks for a great film.
0688170528|5.0|I've now read all of the books I can get my hands on (Mercy is out of print) and have enjoyed each and everyone.<br />The Pact was not the most enjoyable in the series, but certainly was the most thought-provoking.  At often times disturbing, I  nevertheless think that it is a must read for every parent, particularly in the way it illustrates the extreme pressure loving and  well-meaning parents can unintentionally place on their children, often with devastating results.<br />As a doctor who has cared for many adolescents, I think this book has the potential to be a real eye-opener, even though that may  not have been its intended purpose.  I highly recommend this book to all parents.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|As a big Beatles fan, this is a treat. Hopefully they will release another disc with some more tunes. A few that I think are missing are &quot;Strawberry Fields and I Am The Walrus&quot;, to name a few. A nice addition was &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; which I had not heard in a long time. I demand a 2nd CD, I want more!!!
0345350499|4.0|I've read this book (the whole series, actually) several times and never get tired of it.  The characters are beautifully drawn and complex.   I'm in awe of the research and skillful plotting that went into this book.  <br />It is quite detailed, and I can understand how that might try some people's patience.  However, if you allow yourself to become immersed in the beautiful world of this story, you'll never want to leave!!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|this is the Beatles so many great songs on one album.i have a few of there records&amp;the songs never get old they just get better with time.you hear great Compositions&amp;Production.from Eleanor Rigby to the long&amp;winding road you hear there greatness over time.at first they were a so-so Band but then they found themselves&amp;challenged the way music would forever be made&amp;produced.this is very essential this is History.the four lads forever changed the game.
0385484518|5.0|This is, without a doubt, the best book I have read so far this year.  Not only is it a quick read, you will want to read it over and over again when you are feeling down or need some sunlight.  Morrie has become my hero, such a strong man with such a great message to put out.  He made me look back on my life and question what is and what should be important to me.  He reminded me that one should not let the little things get to him, and that one should cherish every moment she has with her loved ones.  I guarantee you that you will love this book, and you will want to give it to all your friends so they too can learn from Morrie - I know I did!
B00004W55E|5.0|Rachelle Ferrell has been a Lady that i have followed for a while.She is a great talent with so much emotion&amp;drive but she doesn't get the love she deserves.the music here really highlights her great voice&amp;talent.check out a true talent.this Sister is tight.
B00003CWPR|5.0|When Stanley Kubrick left us last with his final masterpiece,Eyes Wide Shut, people expecting a (dirty movie) were dissapointed when they were faced with a gem of a film studying the relationship between Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's characters and Tom Cruise's struggle to stay faithful while facing many temptations, almost like Homer's The Odyssey. If you're a fan of Kubrick or are willing to use your brain while watching a film this is definately a film i would reccomend. The transer is top notch and it includes some interesting interviews.
B00003CXFG|4.0|I must admit, that when I went into the cinema to see this film I wasn't expecting anyhting special. Infact, I thought it would be a rubbish addition to the &quot;stuck on planet full of aliens&quot; formula. But what I got was one of the most enjoyable sci-fi films in recent years.<br />The plot may be thin, but thats besides the piont. The characters are what drive and motivate this film and they are all interesting and involving characters. And the best thing about them is the unfamiliarity of them -you really dont know who is going to make it to the final reel.<br />Also the director, David Twohy, must know what he is doing. From the brilliant opening crash scene (which will make your home cinema system growll for more) Pitch Black is handled with skill  and care.<br />Trust me, don't underestimate this film. Turn off the lights, sit back and enjoy one of the most best, underrated sci-fi films of recent years.
078401213X|4.0|Darrin Aronofsky really made a name for himself after Pi debuted at Sundance to rave reviews. Made on an ultra low budget Aronofsky manages to piece together a fantastic film about a genius' struggle to live with his gift. I havn't seen Requim from a Dream yet, but from what I've heard Aronofsky seems to be establishing himself as a great director. Hopefully he'll also be able to save the batman series.<br />A great DVD of an interesting film. Lots of extras and what I assume is a pretty good transfer, but I was unable to see the film in theaters so I don't know what the original has like because the DVD is extremely high contrast and grainy. Well worth a look.
B00004ZB9D|4.0|I love this new song from LENNY. It is much better than the last songs of his lasts albums.I injoy him since the beginning of his career.
B00003CWRX|4.0|The Insider was an amazing film with a great performance by Russell Crowe while Al Pacino gives his usual over the top performance (which for the most part works in this movie). Although the story could've ended up being another sappy Hollywood &quot;pus-job&quot; as someone else put it. Michael Mann uses his great directing skills to turn it into much more. He studies the role ethics play in business and doing the right thing vs. protecting yourself or your family. The only gripe I have with Mann is his choice of music in the film. It's okay most of the time, but in the end when Al Pacino makes his exit to a bass laden rap/techno fusion soundtrack I'd had enough. But the rest of the film is so good I added this movie to my collection a couple days after renting it. <br />The DVD transer is good and the sound is good too, but the extras are dissapointing. What they call a making of featurette is actually just a really short (under 10 minutes) segment with a couple interviews. A great film that didn't get the treatment it deserves on DVD. Oh well, if you're a big fan of the film it'll probably be worth it.
B000051VWW|5.0|I have been waiting patiently for this album release. In great expectation and anticipation I am very satisfied.  Cried through the whole CD as song after song played.  Excellent, nobody can compare to Sade other than Janis Joplin, reaching out to us in her need to express how she feels inside.  Her song comes to us in a soulful wave, reaching us, touching us and forever affecting us. Bravo! All us kindred spirits are calling each other to spread the news about the new album release.  So Excited!               Love, Linda
B00003CXAT|4.0|Jurrasic Park was one of the greatest theater going experiences of my 17 years on this earth and watching it on video just didn't do it justice. Luckily Spielberg was nice enough to release JP on DVD and he didn't hold back at all. The transfer is top notch and the sound is simply amazing. This is as close as you'll get to the cinema experience without building a theater in your house.
0671034065|2.0|Linda Howard is adept at writing sexual dialogue, I will give her that much. However, I found the plot and the characters to be rather unbelievable. To me, if you've got these 3 &quot;best buddy&quot; girlfriends you would DEFINITELY share with them your ordeal with the drunk, wouldn't you? I found the reasoning to be shallow. Also, what WalMart is open at 7 in the morning? She gets up at 6:00 in the morning and then she's out the door to go shopping? Puhleeze! And then putting down Leah because she brings a bag lunch to work? That's a bad thing? I thought that was a poor characterization. But, the thing that really got me was all the space given to describing the antics of BooBoo, the cat...how she had to rush home to feed him, his expressions, etc., but NOTHING ABOUT CHANGING THE LITTER BOX! As every cat owner knows, this is an absolute necessity! A fact that cannot be ignored, and never once did she mention a thing about it. This led me to believe that Linda Howard has NEVER owned a cat and she obviously has a poor editor who did not catch this oversight. This bothered me so much, that I couldn't suspend my disbelief for the rest of the book--she had lost credibility with me as a reader. The only reason I continued reading was because I wanted to read the description of the sex I knew Jaine would finally have with Sam. That relationship sure was forecast from the first few pages....duh! By the way,  I had guessed who the killer was before I was halfway finished with the book. No surprise, there.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This was one of the funniest films of last year while also having another layer beyond a bunch of guys beating eachother up. Edward Norton gives another great performance as the narrator and Brad Pitt is hilarious as Tyler Durden. The directing by David Fincher is imaginative while not being too flashy. Although misunderstood by hundreds of highschool students (who think the movie is &quot;f----n cool!&quot; much like A Clockwork Orange) the film actually is deeper then 80% of the films released every year. <br />The DVD comes in a great case and has two disc. One for the movie and one for extras. The extras are terrific with deleted scenes, alternate opening credits, advertisements, etc. The transfer and sound are also top of the line. This is one of the best DVD's I own and one of my favorite films of 1999, a must have for any fan of the movie.
B000051VWW|4.0|This new one from sade takes her back to the spotlight. Its hard to believe that she was off the scene for 8 years...but shes back. Sade didnt use any new producers like rodney jerkins or shekspere to be current with other artists that are out now. Instead she comes with the style everyone knows her for. This cd is a good follow up to the last cd. The best tracks on this one are: By your side, Lovers rock, Flow, immigrants, and it's only love that gets you through. Even though she didnt use any new producers on this, she used samples from a lot fo different kinds of music like reggae, hip-hop, and rock. It was mostly reggae samples that you could hear but everything works and dosent make her sound like a different artists. Overall sade played it safe and added something differnt to this cd to make it another classic. If there was more songswith a differnt kind of flow I would have given this a five but maybe next time around she will get to do it. The only way to be sure is to listen to this for yourself.
B00003TL18|4.0|In a previous review, I mentioned that I was disappointed that the Oribson / kd lang version of Crying wasn't on this CD. Have since found that track on the King of Hearts CD.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|I was lead to believe that not only would we get the singles, but the original (mono) single mixes.  I could have made this CD myself.  The digital remastering is always going to get better as the years go by, but it's so frustrating that the very people who have access to the catalog keep putting out such short-sighted drivel.  I absolutely hate the stereo &quot;I Want To Hold Your Hand&quot;.  The separation of voices &amp; music equals zero impact, and leads one to ask what the big deal was with these guys to begin with.  These guys helped invent pop music, and they deserve better (and yeah, of course McCartney had all the #1 hits, but not all the best songs).  Silly.
B000002AZ8|5.0|Like all great rock and roll records, this one takes a few listens to truly uncover its greatness.  I didn't really start to love Vitalogy until about the 6th listen and now, years later it is my favorite PJ record of all.  From the depths of Nothingman to the frenetic speed of Spin The Black Circle this record will grow on you listen after listen.  <br />Vitalogy doesn't pander itself, it simply is.
B00000342V|5.0|The best original soundtrack ever? Possibly. I've never seen the movie and it's very unlikely that I will - it's not that easy to find where I live - but I can guarantee that this is a monster CD. It's said that this is the only reason why this movie is so popular, and I can see why.<br />It's said that Curtis himself didn't like the movie. He said the final cut seemed like cocaine propaganda; therefore this record opposes to that. \\"Freddie's Dead\\" and \\"Pusherman\\" don't seem to glorify junkies and drug dealers - but I just don't care too much for the lyrics. It's all about the music - and the music is simply the best.
B000051VWW|4.0|This CD is great for those of us who love Sade.  If you've never heard Sade, I recommend you start with one of her older ones like Love Deluxe or Promise or Diamond Life.  For the Sade fan, you will love her new songs like &quot;By your side&quot;, &quot;Somebody Already Broke My Heart&quot;, Lovers Rock and you will enjoy the different sound to some of the other songs like &quot;slave song&quot;.  You can hear the different influences from different genres of music, that is not heard in previous albums, in some of the new songs.  All in all, a fantastic album, and one to add to the growing Sade collection.
B000051VWW|5.0|I was stunned to her that Sade had this CD coming out. I mean, with her long break and all. But it was well worth it. If you are a Sade fan, then this album is a honest-to-God must have. It is one of her best, if not the best. If you are just hearing about her, then be prepared to be taken in by her jazzy, soothing, yet soft vocals. This album &quot;Lover's Rock&quot; contains some of the best songs I've ever heard. You have songs like &quot;By Your Side&quot; and &quot;King of Sorrow&quot; which are the typical outstanding Sade song. Then you have new sounds like &quot;Flow&quot; , &quot;Somebody Already Broke My Heart&quot;, and &quot;All About Our Love&quot;. All the songs are 5 star songs just like the CD and I recommend to anyone to buy this CD. This is a definite must have whether you're a long-time fan or just getting in to her music.
0440133688|4.0|I think my title pretty well defines this books -there's a lot of humor in it, quite a lot of struggles, and the reader gets to see what an intern goes through...<br />But some how - the \\"wild sex session is a solution for everything\\" attitude was a little too childish in my taste. I'm sure some of it is true to life, but hopefully - our doctors are a little more grownup...
0790749815|5.0|The North By NorthWest dvd edition is exceptional.  Never have I seen an older film look and sound as good as this.  The dolby digital 5.1 surround sound is very dynamic...your subwolfer will get a work out when the oil tanker explodes.  Also, the crop duster scene has been greatly inhanced as well.  Its about time we hear the plane fly over our heads.  But what really shines in the film is its breath-taking music score.  The music on the dvd is better than the actual cd soundtrack itself.  A wonderful remaster.  The orchestra sounds as if it were recorded today, as do the other sound elements on the disk.  Picture quality is superb, not a single artifact...Ive seen films forty years newer than this movie that dont look as clean.  The extras very informative, the commentary funny and interesting, the previews, hilarious.  This is an excellent disk.  Shot in Vistavision, and filmed in technicolor, image quality is painstakingly accurate and colorful.  i can't imagine the film looking better, even on a theatre screen.  If your a fan of the film, you must own this ultimate editon of the Alfred Hitchcock classic.  A motivational speaker for the latter day bond films.  HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!!
0440214041|3.0|A young law student proposes a theory on a supreme court's judge murder. When this theory proves to be too close to the thruth, her life is in danger.<br />The thought that only a young law student, brilliant as she might be, would come up with the right theory for these assasinations makes me happy this is only a story... I'd still like to believe that the FBI, CIA and other bodies who are supposed to handle these situations are far more compentent than pictured in this book... Sadly enough, most of them believe they aren't, especially after watching 'The X Files'.
B000053V7Q|5.0|The reviews shown on this page are for the ORIGINAL 1970 version of this movie, not the &quot;special edition&quot; that goes on sale in January.  I saw this &quot;new&quot; version recently at a cinema in London and it just blows the old version away!! There are no more sad fans comments, but more Elvis, with plenty of humour from the king and over 40 minutes of previously unseen material. Elvis jokes around with his band and looks superb. Several mild expletives that were previously edited out are now re-instated and the whole production has a modern &quot;MTV&quot; style about it. Ignore the reviews for the old version, this film is now the business!!!
0440224764|5.0|The story itself was fascinating - of one smart man overcoming his partners in a law firm, his wife, the police - both before and after being caught. His girlfriend's character and motives for what she did still fascinate me!
B00004YRQA|5.0|The memory card has a lot of space on it (apparently it has 8MB)and all but they'll probably come out with a new one in 6 months (with more space).Overall it works great and loads very fast compared to the psx memory card.
B00004X01U|3.0|I didn't think much of Music when it first came out but I've been listening over and over and it's grown on me. I think however that on some of the tracks we go a little too techno. Nobody's Perfect is fantastic and Paradise Not for Me reminds me of an Enigma track. Lyrically Madonna goes from very poinient (Gone) to throughaway filler (Impressive Instant). Music as a whole, it is not coherent like Ray of Light was, but it does stand as a great collection of Dance Songs, which I think was Madonna's intention this go around. All in all it's never a waste to hear Madonna's new music, but overall it is not one of her greatest
0800187873|5.0|I didn't think this film was all that good while I was watching it, but afterwards all of the subtle touches came streaming back. Organized crime simply cannot be as glamorous as films like \\"The Godfather\\" portray it; it consists of petty details like two-bit hoods trying to break into parking meters and shaking down bar owners. This film captures that reality, while at the same time riveting the viewer's attention.<br /><br />Al Pacino, once again, is magnificent. In this case, however, he has a co-star (Johnny Depp) who holds his own, and then some.<br /><br />Good stuff. At the price, this is a great bargain.
B00004ZB9D|4.0|Lenny Kravitz has been unfairly typecast in his career. He's always compared to Prince and Hendrix, and that's not fair, he has his own style, his own vision. The tracks here represent the best of his career. Are you Gonna Go my Way is a great rocker and the new track Again is very catchy. Lenny has a great retro sound to his music that lets him appeal to young and old audiences alike. Fly Away was a bit overplayed but is still a good song. Unfortunatley, they left off Live from 5 which I thought was great. Otherwise it is a solid collection from a versitle artist
B000051VWW|5.0|Cook it in a small spoon and savor it. This stuff doesn't come around very often.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|A collection of The Beatles no. 1 hits is not a terrible idea by itself, but No.1's never mean their greatest songs.<br />No  Day In the Life -  Rocky Racoon - Sexy Sadie - Lucy In The Sky - In My Life - You've Got To hide you love away -<br />These Are their no. 1's to me but, this is aimed at casual fans (is there such a thing). After all, every piece of music we listen to today has been influenced by The Beatles. This won't be in my collection but if it converts the casual listner to a die hard, then hey, I'm all for it.
B00003CWPR|2.0|Years had elapsed between one of his films and the next, yet to all, even his detractors, a new Stanley Kubrick picture was always an event. Perhaps the most intriguing of directors, his films were so few and far between because Kubrick, unlike every living filmmaker, had to invent a new language with which to tell his bold, perplexing and always rewarding stories. Few people agree on the merits of his films.  Yet, as I dislike some of his work, I can understand people's appreciation of it. <br /> What a shame it is then to see Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. A bloodless, joyless and yes, shallow whimper of an exit. The reviews for the film have a morbid fascination all their own, they systematically and often passionately analyse and search for meaning for what is essentially eye candy. These reviews say more about the reviewers then they do about the film. Kubrick's weighty name has prompted film lovers to offer explanations, excuses and delusions about the undoubtedly profound journey of one Dr. Bill Hartford (Tom Cruise), who after hearing his wife's all to brief confession to fantasising about another man, goes on an all night odyssey to regain his sexual prowess. The meaning of life must be in there somewhere. On the face of it, a film that inspires this much reflection, even if it is for the wrong reason, can only be a good thing. Then again, apply that level of sincere analysis to a soft-core cable show, and the results will perhaps yield greater insight. <br /> But Eyes Wide Shut is too lifeless to be compared to soft-core, although the dialogue is often reminiscent of those embarrassing late night excuses for a shag. Dr. Bill's bizarre habit of repeating the last sentence said to him in almost all his conversations aside (my guess is that the character is supposed to be a little dim or perhaps untainted by the politics of life), the character is about as human as you can get in a Kubrick film, which puts him a few notches below Hal from 2001. It is tempting to blame the stars, who often resort to furiously rubbing their temples to suggest inner-conflict, but that would be unfair. In the brief documentary that follows the film, Kidman says that Kubrick let the actors try as many things as they liked before both, the actors and Kubrick jointly, decided which take to print. Try as they might, with this strangulate script and this fatal precision, there simply is nothing there.<br /> Eyes Wide Shut is not without merit. The film's washed out colours, the elegant tracking shots, the patient mise-en-scene, the incendiary and brilliant use of music promise great mystery, a foreboding malice. An absorbing prevarication that flirts with the border that seperates dreams and nightmares, but is undone, at a snail's pace with a plot that can only be called preposterous. The disappointment is not unlike that of Ridley Scott's The Duellists, a striking film whose aesthetic richness similarly proved to be a glossy ribbon around nothing. In a film as lacking as this one obviously is, the presence of good scenes like Kidman's confession and the grandiose orgy sequence (censored in the US version) are a juxtaposition to its shortcomings. A good story touts and justifies the style in which it is told, a bad one hides behind it. Kubrick, once the inventor of filmic language has regressed into the age old story of insecurity of two married hollow masses. Consequently, Eyes Wide Shut is a dramatic, artistic and emotional dead zone.
B0000025T6|5.0|Let me begin by saying that I am not a big Bruce Springsteen fan. His &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; pop-ness just doesn't appeal to me. That's why I was so pleasantly surprised by this album, which I am sure has gone undiscovered even from many bigger Boss fans than I.<br />I have seen this work described as &quot;haunting,&quot; &quot;quiet&quot; and &quot;folksy,&quot; but each of these words cannot do the album true justice. I listen to music no matter my mood, and I like to select music that can flow with my emotions. Nebraska has just ascended to the No. 1 spot when I am in need of some quiet or some comfort.<br />The E-Street Band is conspicuously absent, yet nothing is lacking. Bruce has a great voice - a pleasant mix of gravel sorrow - and his soft guitar plucks simple melodies that create so much beauty. &quot;Hey somebody out there/ listen to my last prayer/ Hi ho silver-o deliver me from nowhere,&quot; he pleads in &quot;State Trooper.&quot;<br />Each of Nebraska's songs carry this same sort of soft desparation, something we've all felt and will appreciate being conveyed so poetically. It's almost a gospel for the damned - those who are struggling for their own piece of America. It's music that means something, and that makes it worth 1,000 times what you will pay for it.
B00003CX8J|5.0|this is, in my opinion, the pinnacle of what creative talents in the comic industry as well as the movie industry can create if they do it right(remember 'Men In Black?' that's one too).  X-Men manages to welcome people who have never read the comic wholeheartedly into the marvel universe, while staying true to the die-hard fans.  in short, the story is great, the visuals and music are astounding, and it was meant to be seen in DVD. oh, and by the way, the DVD contains never before seen footage from the movie, one containing Spider Man.  if you haven't seen this yet in the theaters, you don't know what you are missing.  and if you have, then you must know how much of a must-have item this is.
B00000612G|5.0|You've heard him rock with Bon Jovi, perhaps heard Stranger in this Town but this is Richie Sambora at his best.  Soul is the force behind this album.  It has Richie's trademark guitar solos, All that Really Matters is just beautiful.  It has powerful lyrics - more mature than Stranger in this Town- and out from the shadow of backing vocals, a strong voice that makes you wonder why this is only his second solo album.  If God was a Woman is the only real rock song on the album - and it rocks!     There are love songs - In It For Love and All That Really Matters, songs that will make you cry - Harlem Rain, Fallen from Graceland, songs that will make you think, Who I am, Chained and the title track - Undiscovered Soul is the master piece.   Richie blends soul, guitar and powerful song writing with an ease that will make this album a permanent feature on your stereo.  As Sambora said for Stranger in this Town - turn down the lights, light a candle, welcome...
0451191153|3.0|A good book, although it's very much like Atlas Shrugged--I think I like Atlas better.  Howard and Dominique are both cold and indifferent to everyone and everything but each other.  The end is not at all surprising.  In fact, hardly anything in the book surprises me.  Rand uses her books as a pulprit to preach the same sermon again and again.
0375420525|5.0|When Mark says that House of Leaves will change your life, it's no understatement. Since reading this novel, I've been looking at everything in a different way. Every single day something happens that reminds me of the novel in some way. I want to discuss it soo badly, but none of my friends have read it yet.<br />If you are looking for a great mind trip that refuses to leave your psyce, this is it.
0684833395|4.0|hilarious insights and incidents.  An original account of war.  Yossarrian is indeed crazy, but so is the world. Good ending.  I knew all along that Orr was going to get his &quot;Sweden&quot;
B000053GTK|5.0|Finally!  This is it.  This is Gentle Giants best and most spontaneous work-of-art.  This music was produced during a time when music was extremely over-produced.  Such exhaustive examples are Pink Floyd's &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, Supertramp's &quot;Crime of the Century&quot;, Genesis's &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot;...ect.  Imagine what Gentle Giant might sound like if they were deep and heavy?  I owned a tape of this music when I was fouteen and I felt quite sophisticated listening to it.  Later on I spent five years trying to find the album and one day there it was.  I still have the album and the music is still very sophisticated and deliciously melodic and heavy.
0440180295|4.0|Billy Pilgrim is unstuck in time.  He can flip around randomly throughout his life whereever he wants to go.  He serves as a chaplain's assistant in World War II, is captured by Germans, survives the largest massacre in European history, the fire bombing of dresden.  It's so ironically funny at times.  It was interesting, finding out how billy came up with his delusions.
B00000JPH6|5.0|I am sorry for the people who feel that the only reason a movie gets good reviews is because people are fans of the creators work. I watch this movie when I was 6 years old and it has always been a favorite. I think we are expecting too much of the older films due to the high tech quality we have now. And frankly it's not fair to judge it that way. I feel the story had depth, and good character developement. Anyone who gets the DVD should watch the Making of...it gives you a better appreciation of the movie.
B000051VWW|5.0|When they started advertising Sade's new CD I think we all were wondering if she could recreate the magic after being away for so long. Well, I think she has and then some. The jazz radio stations started to play certain cuts on the radio leading up to the release of the CD, starting with &quot;By Your Side&quot; a song reminiscent of prior Sade music. The whole CD is worth listening to when you just want to kick back and relax. In listening to the CD I think Sade has a message she wants to convey to her fans. Take the time to listen to the words as well as the music. The title cut &quot;Lovers Rock&quot; I think is as good a song as Sade's has ever produced. The percussion rift on this song is very lovely &amp; haunting. A classic to be sure! You can't miss with &quot;Lovers Rock&quot;
B000051VWW|5.0|The CD has been well worth the wait.  &quot;By Your Side&quot; is one of the most hauntingly beautiful songs I've heard in a long time.  It's a song that will leave many people feeling as if they could have written it, as if they could have been the first to speak these truthful words to their lover.  It will be one of my favorites forever.
B00003W8NM|5.0|The defining film for the dislocated, young, generation of today; or as Edward Norton put it in the films commentary: one of a &quot;new wave of zeitgeist films&quot;. Unfortunately, the majority of opinions vocalized for &quot;Fight Club&quot; have completely misinterpreted David Fincher's and Chuck Palahniuk's message. This is not a pro-fascist, a pro-violent or a pro-nihilist film whatsoever. Toss whatever you heard from Rosie O'Donnell out the window. What Fincher has crafted here is a brilliant and witty contemporary masterpiece using stunning visuals and hilarious irony. However, be warned: this is no humble &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; and it's far darker than &quot;American Beauty&quot;, nonetheless Fincher always includes a dose of comic relief from the film's darkest moments.<br />If your are used to typical, uninspired, formulaic, Hollywood films, the method in which &quot;Fight Club&quot;'s message is delivered may disturb you. However, by the end of &quot;Fight Club&quot;, I guarantee you will be convinced of the directorial talent of David Fincher and the outstanding, acting, ability of Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter.<br />A note for those of you purchasing the DVD. Without question, it is definitely worth it. The 2 CD set comes packed with 4 different commentaries, the &quot;Fight Club&quot; catalogue, deleted scenes w/commentary, hilarious Public Service Announcements and plenty of other goodies to keep you busy.
0060920386|5.0|The detail of this book is incredible.  Burrough and Helyar have every angle of this extraordinary LBO accounted for, down to specific dialogue.  It's an incredible account of high-powered executive greed, and how it is dictated by excessive pride, or hubris.
B00003CWL6|1.0|With a half hour left, and realizing that Kevin Spacey's death was imminnent, my wife and I both decided we could turn the movie off and not really care what happened in the rest of the movie. It plods along, and you wait for something - ANYTHING - of any substance to happen to draw you in and keep you hooked, but nothing ever does. <br />If you look back at the trailers, the trailers show every (and the only) funny scenes in the movie, setting up the movie to look like a comedy! Spacey catching his cheating wife at the drive-thru window, Spacey: &quot;I rule!&quot;, Spacey throwing plate across room -- all (and the only) funny scenes in the movie, all of which appear in the trailer! Is the movie a comedy? From the trailer you think it is - and when the movie starts and Kevin Spacey announces he's dead, and the movie is the events leading up to death, you say, &quot;If he's already dead, why should I even care?&quot;<br />And the penutlimate exchange with Kevin Spacey and the next door neighbor is painfully insipid. After the end of the movie, you look back to that scene, and say to yourself, &quot;What a moron. If he had just used a different word or explained himself or had not been so vague, maybe Kevin Spacey wouldn't have died.&quot; I likened it to every Three's Company plot - a simple misunderstanding in commmunication leads to hilarious consequences. If only he had explained himself and used real-people words instead of movie-people words, the outcome would not have been the same.<br />Nothing of substance, this movie is all hype.
B000051VWW|2.0|The drum and bass tracks on this album overwhelm any other sounds. These almost sound like unfinished tracks, awaiting the addition of horns and strings. Aside from rhythm, the only other sound is a guitar. Sade's vocals are buried in the mix. After sitting through 11 numbing tracks of beating and pounding, one longs for some of the sweet saxaphone solos on previous Sade hits such as &quot;Your Love Is King&quot; and &quot;Is It A Crime&quot;.
B000051VWW|3.0|I am a huge Sade fan...I have pretty much everything she has done...Cd's, cd singles, even import stuff....I have read great reviews of Lovers Rock, but I think it is just ok...it is a must buy for Sade fans, but it is far from her best work....
B000023VR6|5.0|Dr. Dre's newest cd is a hip-hop masterpiece.  This CD has more classic rap songs then anyother.  From the tight beat of Still D.R.E. to the work of audio art that is known as The Next Episode this CD screams quality.  Lots of fly duets with Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Nate Dogg, Xidbit and lots of other hip-hop superstars make this the peak of street rhythm.  It dosen't turn rap upside down, it just delivers the best hip-hop experience yet.  What can I say?  This line could never be more truthfull:<br />&quot;Dr. Dre is the name still ahead of my game&quot;
B000003BEM|5.0|The last album recorded by the original band and it's very strong. Sympathy For The Devil is not only the best song on the album by far, but the Stones best ever song and the 2nd best song of all time. Keith's plays his best ever solo and one of the best solos ever, along with some great bass and Mick's genius lyrics. Brian's slide is all over this album, especially on the beautiful ballad No Expectations and the climatic Jig Saw Puzzle. Street Fighting Man is another classic, with great layed acoustic guitars and it's rebellious if dated lyrics. Not really any weak tracks, except for perhaps the country song Dear Doctor, which although charming, is not as strong as any of the others. Stray Cat Blues is the only electric song other than Sympathy on the album. Keith plays an nasty solo at the end and Mick snarls his way through the blatantly sexual lyrics. Factory Girl is another really good, acoustic song. The ballad Salt Of The Earth closes the album well. Keith does a real nice job on his first solo vocals in the opening verse. Overall, this album bites and hits home despite the fact that it is mostly acoustic. Beggar's marks the beginning of the Stones invicibility and also Brian Jones's last full work with the band.
0375420525|4.0|Take a twilight show episode and send it to an MIT student as his thesis topic.  Take you insane mother and all the letters she sent you.  Take an Los Angeles bar hopper, swinger kid, have him write about his exploits, his one night stands, his tattoo parlor job, his stripper friends.  Take the footnotes from David Foster Wallace's &quot;Infinite Jest&quot;, shorten them, and give them a little less hidden agendas.  These are only part of the greater attraction of House of Leaves.  And much like it's namesake, the fictional house that is larger inside than out, this story will draw you further and further in, right until the end.  Despite it's being classified as horror, it didn't quite frighten me, but it does grip you, keep you wondering about it, even when you're not reading it.  This is a perfect book for a long flight, but do yourself a favor, don't skimp on the paperback version.  Get yourself a hardback, you'll need the durability.
B000051VWW|5.0|...it has got to be about our love for all these true Sade fans to have waited so long for this CD. I was absolutely overjoyed as the days drew closer to the release of Sade's new CD.  Needless to say, she did not let me down at all.  Lover's Rock is solid, unmistakenly Sade-mellow-jazzy music.  Filled with insight and emotion, this CD takes the listener on a familiar trip down Sade lane.  Feeling the love of By Your Side....the sadness and tear drops of King of Sorrow and Somebody Already Broke My Heart.....the strength and awareness of Slave Song and Immigrant.....let's just say this is a must-buy.  After so many years of waiting on Sade's CD, &quot;It's Only Love That Gets You Through&quot; and love that keeps you coming back for more wonderful music!!!!  The lady and the band with the moving voice and melodic groove have definitely returned. Enjoy!
B00004ZD69|4.0|This is the first Godspeed You Black Emperor album i've purchased and it is awe inspiring.  Not quite classical music, but definitely sounding composed, this band makes their feelings felt without the need of a voice, except for those random samplings, including recordings of ARCO gas station announcements, and an old man telling his stories of NY.  Perhaps the fact that most songs are over 15 minutes is the reason nobody's been brazen enough to play this on the radio.  Radio is the lesser because of it.  get this album, and throw your radio away.
B000000XCH|5.0|Fantasy/OJC continues to push the 16bit sound enevelope.  Their K2 (a JVC process) remasters of mostly jazz titles are without a doubt the best sounding CD's made.  They are better than the now defunct Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs, DCC or Chesky &quot;audiophile&quot; discs.  Fantasy knew they had a small goldmine in their back catalog and someone there knew good sound when they heard it (JVC K2 process).  They put them both together to re-release the whole CCR catalog in this technologically superior format.  As a CCR fan, I chose COSMO'S FACTORY as my first remaster purchase.  The sound is INCREDIBLE.  I defy anyone to listen to this disc without the obligatory toe tapping and head bobbing.  But try and keep your head in one place so you can hear the CCR/K2 magic.  On a high resolution system it is nothing short of amazing.  On the Stereophile rating scale, I give it 5 stars for content and 5 stars for sound.
B000051VWW|5.0|Sade has done it again with another masterpiece: &quot;Lovers Rock&quot;. While some may say this sounds like Love Deluxe part two, you will definately be surprised upon listening to this. &quot;Slave Song&quot;, and &quot;It's Only Love That Gets You Through&quot; both have deep messages throughout while &quot;Slave Song&quot; has the uptempo club-like beat but yet very smooth. &quot;Lovers Rock&quot; is a typical Sade track with it's soothing bass lines, while &quot;Flow&quot;, brings up the tempo a little bit. &quot;The Sweetest Gift&quot;, although very short, is a song she created for her daughter, while &quot;By Your Side&quot; although with a country flavor, affirms to her lover that she will be there unconditionally. Lovers Rock lives up to her long absence and this CD is highly recommended for all who appreciates quality music...May her spirit live long!!!...Sdeez
B000001FQ4|4.0|Apparently the band hated this album when it came out, guitarist Scott Gorham complaining that the producer made them sound like a cheesey cocktail lounge act. But as we know sometimes a band's worst critic is the band themselves, and in this case they were somewhat off the mark. Yes, it is a far cry from the harder rocking Lizzy lps that were to follow, but &quot;NightLife&quot; has a great variety of songs, from the jazz-influenced title track, to the plaintive and sad &quot;Frankie Carroll&quot;, to the funky &quot;Showdown&quot;. Phil Lynnott's song-writing is melodic and lyrical; few other writers could bring a story to life through music as well as he could. Even though it was the first Lizzy lp to feature Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson on guitar, the famous trademark Lizzy twin guitar sound did not really emerge until the next lp, Fighting. If anything, &quot;Nightlife&quot; has more in common with Phil Lynnott's later solo albums, if that's any help.
B00000IL1K|5.0|Ms. Brightman's voice is indeed a thing of beauty.  Her songs denote passion, pain, and intensity in different form.  This disc is definately a must-have, as it contains, in my opinion, the best work she has done solo in years.  The title track, predictably enough I am afraid, happens to be my personal favorite from this particular disc, as it is complex yet very simplistic to varying degrees.  Sarah's voice is so astounding that she is an ispiration to those of us who aspire to sing, even if simply doing so in the shower.  Highly recommended, as the variety of songs on this disc make it a great listen anytime of the day or night.
B00004XMV6|5.0|I first watched this movie in high school &amp; I think it changed my life. I would walk in downtown Seattle hoping to meet my very own Mickey Rourke. I became dreamy and romantic, expecting that this was what adult love was all about. So, here I am 10+ years later thankfully realizing that life is not really portrayed in movies! While this movie was packed full of juicy sex, I consider it to be very romantic too. John's painful heartbreak in the last scene gives us evidence of this. What woman did not fall hopelessly in love with Mickey Rourke after this movie? And if you aren't a fan of romance, the movie offers us a feast for the senses. Every scene is visually explosive &amp; the soundtrack is incredible! To this very day, any time I hear &quot;Slave to Love&quot;, &quot;You Can Leave Your Hat On&quot;, or any other song from this movie, it conjures up the very scene it was played. I think I am going to watch the movie right now...
B00004ZAV3|1.0|Nothing more here than an attempt by George, Paul, and Ringo to squeeze more money out of the buying public with some very tired songs that are ready for retirement. Honestly, do we need to hear Penny Lane, Love Me Do, Yesterday, Come Together, or Let It Be any more? All these songs already appear on the '62-66 and '67-70 compilations.<br />A better idea would've been to release a Beatles album of some of the lesser known gems featuring songs like: If I Fell, Tell Me Why, You're Gonna Lose That Girl, If I Needed Someone, You Won't See Me, The Night Before, And Your Bird Can Sing, I've Got a Feeling, Things We Said Today, Golden Slumbers Medley, Oh Darling, I Me Mine, Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite, Dear Prudence, and Glass Onion.
0679879269|5.0|Philip Pullman couldn't have done better! Will and Lyra encounter many danger ous adventures in this great novel, my personal favorite being their journey into the world of the dead. Thier daemons take their final form at the very end ... Mrs. Coulter is back, although she confuses me more than ever! Anyway, this is a FANTASTIC book, and anyone in their right mind would be forced to read it. One hint, however: read the first 2 books in the series first!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|The Beatles are that rarity...a great &quot;singles&quot; act and an almost peerless &quot;album&quot; act.  Why issue this CD filled to the brim with most of their greatest hits, when they are all available elsewhere?  The answer may be in that this collection has been heavily advertised to teens and pre-teens...and what better starting point for the next wave of Beatlemania than this CD?  <br />I don't think anyone would dispute that the Beatles' music is timeless.  However, it's only timeless if future generations receive exposure to it.  Contrary to popular belief, children get exposed to a lot wider variety of music than just the Britney wave of Y2K idols.  In fact, how many kids nowadays have every major ABBA hit memorized (even my three-year old has them etched in her brain pretty solidly)? Think of the marketing genius (the ABBA GOLD CDs, the A-Teens, the Mamma-Mia musical, etc.) that has enabled ABBA to have their careers revived (without their having to reunite!), and wonder if it would be fair for the the greatest of the great--The Beatles--to get left behind...or turned into a trivia question such as, &quot;name a popular '60s pop group who was an influence on ABBA?&quot;<br />If you fans truly love the Beatles, you might just buy a couple of these and give them away as Holiday presents to anyone too young to vote!  And be prepared for a revival of Beatlemania, because all of us adults know they're way cooler than N'Sync!
B00003CX7L|5.0|Like my title says, I have a two year old that loves this movie.  She loves to scream out the names of the characters as they appear on screen.  When wheezy starts to sing his song at the end of the movie she turns to me and says &quot;more story&quot;.  I have seen this movie approx. 50 times and still can sit through it (although not with the same energy as the first 10 times).  This has to be the best movie for 2-3 yr. olds on the market
1555211976|5.0|I Bought this book a couple of years ago and found it to be the most utterly enjoyable collection and find myself returning to it time and time again.  From his earliest works on &quot;Tamerlane&quot;  his work as a playwrite on &quot;The Politian&quot;.  This book has it all.  The Poe's novel, &quot;The Narrative Of A. Gordon Pym&quot;, down to Arthur Conan Doyle's blueprint for Sherlock Holmes comprised in the three tales of C. August Dupine.  It has everything even thoughts of Poe in his essays such as the opening to the poetry portion of the anthology entitled, &quot;The Rational Of Verse&quot;.  As an extreme Poe enthusiast who has written papers since highschool on his works to the man himself this collection is an excellent addition to any library of classic horror and the macabre.
0671034065|5.0|Mr Perfect was wonderful. I've read all of Linda Howard's books and this one was one of my favorites. Sam and Jaine are hot! . He sounds yummy!  I would love to have a neighbor like him.  I took my book after reading it the second time and had Linda Howard sign it and she was so nice. I love her books. I just wish she would write them faster.
B00004XQP4|4.0|This album rocks!!  Green day has explored new melodies and played with new ideas, but have stayed true to their roots.  They haven't &quot;sold out&quot; or pulled a Madonna.  As the bad matures, note how their lyrics are filled with introspection and deeper ideas.  Buy this one.  Also, check out Nimrod and Dookie.
B000002OX7|5.0|the first thing you must consider when listening to this &quot;album&quot; is that these are the remnants of the self destructive &quot;Lifehouse&quot; project.  but despite that, it's still amazingly cohesive and flowing.  the album as a whole creates quite an impressive atmosphere, but when all is said and done it all comes down to the songs, and &quot;Who's Next&quot; stands tall.<br />when you read something like &quot;every song is great&quot; in a review, you automatically assume it's some crazed fan.  i can honestly say that every song on this album is superb, and i'm not just being a crazed fan.  as of the time of this writing, &quot;Who's Next&quot; is one of the few albums on Amazon with a 5 star average customer review rating.<br />&quot;Going Mobile&quot; and &quot;Love Ain't For Keeping&quot; are fun acoustic tracks, very well-written. &quot;My Wife&quot; is John Entwistle's contribution, as expected, clever, witty, and knee-deep in his twisted humor.<br />&quot;The Song Is Over&quot; and &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; are two beautifully written ballads.  &quot;Getting In Tune&quot; starts out like another ballad, but soon slips into full rock anthem.  &quot;Bargain&quot; is one of the harder rocking songs of this collection.  the catchphrase is one of the catchiest on the album (right up there with &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot;), but really the best part of the song, and my favorite line from the whole album, comes from the bridge which Pete sings beautifully (if you want to know what it is, you have to buy the CD, but it's the 'one and one' part).<br />as for best song of the album, both &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot; and &quot;Baba O'Riley&quot; tower high above the rest of this amazing album.  the former, is probably the closest thing to the rock &amp; roll of the old Who, and the best known and most popular of this album.  the latter, on the other hand, is quite unlike anything anyone else had ever done before, or anything i had ever heardbefore.  from the very beginning, that great synth intro get's you really excited and pumped up for the song and the whole album (if you don't own the album, the realaudio clip here on Amazon hardly does it justice, but you can hear the beginning, with the synthesizer faintly playing in the background).  quite an amazing track all the way through, i was simply shocked the first time i heard it.  i don't think i can pick one, you'll have to choose for yourself.<br />this CD remaster sounds amazing, and after listening to the supposed digital remaster of &quot;A Quick One&quot;, it's quite refreshing.  the liner notes are possibly even more valuable, including some by Pete Townshend, enlightening us all about the entire &quot;Lifehouse&quot; project.  just as valuable, though, are the generous bonus tracks.  here you get 7 tracks, 4 studio tracks (of which 3 were part of &quot;Lifehouse&quot;, but didn't make it to &quot;Who's Next&quot;, the other an alternate), 2 live tracks (also part of &quot;Lifehouse, but cut), and the B-Side to &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot;.<br />i bought this CD because i was curious, and had read somewhere that &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot; was a good song.  i personally did not expect much more from the rest of the album.  i was so wrong.  it's gonna take a while to fully digest this album, but right now it's sitting number 1 for my all time album list. no matter who you are, i personally believe after listening to this album you'll be ashamed of whatever else you had been listening to before.  (the first 45 seconds of &quot;Baba O'Riley&quot; should be enough to convince you!)
B000002N2P|5.0|The only contradiction with this album is the fact that it hasn't been their top seller.  They come out guns blazing and finish with the best song on the album: &quot;Walking Contradiction.&quot;  At a time when supposed hard core bands think it's time to reflect, Green Day knocks off your socks with this one.  This is their best yet.  Check out Warning and Nimrod.
B000001Y79|5.0|Have you ever wondered what C.D. to buy that you won't get tired of?  Wonder no more--- No Doubt's, Tragic Kingdom is the C.D. for you.  Lead vocalist Gwen Stefani and her boy band of four have put together a mixture of songs that is sure to keep your heart pounding with their up beat tunes.   If you enjoy the sound of rock and roll along with ska or hard rock, you will definitely be in heaven when you listen to the songs recorded here.  You may have read some of the other reviews about how Gwen's voice is scratchy and whiny but I would just like to tell you that this is not true.  Every person has his or her own personal style of singing and this is her style.  Gwen's voice fits her songs though and what her song's have to say.  I would like to end on the note that if you don't like what you hear on this C.D. then you should at least buy some one of their singles for \\"Spider-webs\\", \\"Don't Speak\\", or \\"Just a Girl\\".  These are the songs that you have heard on the radio, and you obviously enjoyed them if you came to read the reviews about the whole C.D.
B000002LQR|4.0|The kings of Funk Punk do it again.  These guys change it up enough to keep it fresh, but stay true to their sound.  Buy this one.  Also, check out the other punkers Green Day, Dookie and Nimrod.
B0000074GK|5.0|JUST A FANTASTIC ALBUM FROM START TO FINISH! CAPTURES THE BEST SOUND OF THUNDER BEFORE THEY MOVED ON TO THEIR MORE FAMILIAR RADIO/CONCERT FRIENDLY TRACKS. EVERY TRACK A CLASSIC. BUY IT NOW!
B000003TAR|5.0|The best alternative follow up to the best alternative album of all time!!  It's a must buy.  Also, check out Soundgarden and Green Day (Nimrod).
B000002MTR|5.0|One Hot Minute is one hot album.  Don't be fooled by some of the tender melodies, this album gets punky and funky.  Listen to this one in the car........a must buy.  Also, check out Blink 182's new one, and Green Day's Nimrod.
0800184327|4.0|I agree with the majority of reviews I've seen at Amazon about this movie, I truly enjoyed Vanessa Williams and Chayenne in this move and was impressed with Vanessa's &quot;professional&quot; competition latin dancing.  As someone who has competed in ballroom dance competitions (as the amateur half of a pro-am partnership), I LOVED the fact that this film used REAL professional latin competitors like Rick Valenzuela, Tony Meredith and Melanine Lapatin, and other U.S. and Canadian couples that I've seen at dance competitions.  When I hear the music in the opening scene in Cuba and at the &quot;club&quot;, it makes me get up and perform my old routines in the living room. FINALLY, a movie with ballroom dancing that doesn't make a mockery of it!
B000002534|5.0|Read John Williams of Manchester, England's review folks; I couldn't say it any better. I was so impressed with this one I bought some of the studio musicians featured here's solo efforts. &quot;Mirage&quot; is haunting; &quot;Promise of a Fisherman&quot; is a musical journey; 3 or 4 of the tracks featuring Christian artist Leon Patillo could, in fact, go into contemporary Hymnals. Like its brilliant predesssor &quot;Welcome&quot;,an album full of mood and concept and, of course, that wonderful melodic guitar! One of my 2 or 3 favorite musicians of all time.  Enjoy!
0316920045|2.0|*Infinite Jest*  is about -- I THINK -- the denizens of a  &quot;tennis academy&quot;  that's academically accredited  (are there such places?  I'm pretty naive about stuff like this), as well as a group of drug addicts in a halfway house situated nearby.  Any connection between the two seems to be oblique.  Also, Wallace really belabors this massively uninteresting conceit that in the near future, time will be  &quot;subsidized&quot;  by corporations like Depend Adult Undergarments.  This is not as funny as the author presumes.  Along those lines, the notion of Quebecois  &quot;terrorists&quot;  in WHEELCHAIRS is as eccentric as stuff you'd read in contemporary  &quot;Southern&quot;  fiction, and just as wearisome.  Some more of Wallace's great ideas:  a sort of gigantic projectile-thingy that slingshots all our garbage into Canada, with whom we're apparently at war  (wasn't this in a John Candy movie?) . . . child-sized hamsters, mutated as a result of all that garbage . . . a video cartridge that so hypnotizes the viewer as to literally kill him by starvation . . . so forth.  If the above sounds like a good read to you, by all means, go to it.<br />The characters?  Well, the Incandenza family takes precedence, which is unfortunate because they're the least interesting group in the book, especially young Hal, matriculating under the watchful eye of his mother April and uncle at the tennis academy.  I kind of liked older brother Orin, who is a punter for the Arizona Cardinals.  But Hal, despite Wallace's best efforts to make him our compelling surrogate through all this foolishness, comes across a geeky cipher.  (His constant quoting from the Oxford Dictionary doesn't help.)  Hal has another brother, young Mario, whom the author has seen fit to endow with flipper arms and hands like fins.  Why?  The only major character who  &quot;connects&quot;  is drug addict Don Gately, but even here, Wallace haloes the character with such ponderous prose that even HE seems boring.<br />Prose?  Well, I admit there are some great moments -- indeed, that's why I'm giving this novel 2 stars instead of 1.  Some of the best stuff is in the gimmicky  &quot;footnotes&quot;  at the back of the book, particularly the  &quot;filmography&quot;  of James Incandenza, wherein the author humorously catalogues some terrible-sounding movies.  The synopses of the movies are a must -- pretty hilarious stuff.  During the actual narrative itself, the book zips along quite nicely when Wallace drops the aggravating postmodern style and focuses on movement and development.  I suspect such moments were the hardest for Wallace to write, because they clearly required some effort and thought.  The postmodern stream-of-consciousness nattering clearly did not.  While I don't doubt that Wallace is certainly smarter than me, maybe smarter than everyone in the world, that DOES NOT make him a good novelist.  A novel is not a quiz show.  In other words, I don't CARE how brilliant you are!  WRITE A GOOD STORY!  Also, don't invent conceits that trap you, i.e., Subsidized Time  (one easily senses the grinding adherence Wallace forced on himself -- what starts out as a pleasantry becomes an albatross around the writer's neck, and ours).  Finally -- and this is key -- stop trying to outdo Thomas Pynchon.  He ALREADY WROTE  *Gravity's Rainbow*.  Dude -- try something else.  Please!!
B000051VWW|4.0|I love Sade, mainly because her voice is unlike any other and she stands in a class alone. I was so excited to hear &quot;By your side&quot; that I anxiously counted down the days until the entire compilation was released. I do agree with the notion that this album is similar yet very different from her previous work. &quot;Lover's Rock&quot; and &quot;King of Sorrow&quot; are haunting and beautiful pieces that remind me of &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; and &quot;The Sweetest Taboo&quot; with simple melodies and strings combined with thought provoking lyrics. I hope that Sade fans aren't turned off by some of the slightly fast paced beats, I think it is wonderful that as an artist her music has expanded while still creating a style that unique in it's own right. Sade's message of tortured unrequited love has not changed; she just has a slightly different method that works just as well. Enjoy!
B00004XOWM|4.0|Limp Bizkit is a band that just keeps getting better and better.  Unlike thier previous two c.d.'s, this one is one that can be listened to start to finish without any &quot;significant&quot; low points.  There may not be any huge stand-out songs like Nookie, but overall it's thier best c.d. to date.  They range thier tempo from song to song.  Some are as hard as they've ever been, some are as wimpy, some are as close to rap, some are still hard on the rock.  Good mix of songs, good c.d.  Not a bad purchase at all.
0780631684|5.0|First of all, anyone expecting Final Destination to be a horror movie will be disappointed.  Instead, Destination is one of the best thrillers and over all movies ever.  The idea of Death killing people because of it being their time is great and the plot twists that abound concerning who dies next are even better.  The DVD takes the movie even further, however, by showing some of the deleted scenes and a great alternate ending (though one can understand why it was cut as it sets up for a sequel in many instances).  The only downside to the movie is that it never reveals why the main character had the flash to start with, but you become so involved with the movie (and the fact some characters die with little warning) that you never think about it until the movie is over.  This is a great movie for any one who loves smart movies.
0684867621|3.0|First, know that I am a longtime Stephen King fan -- you should be aware of the reviewer's biases, after all. I was particularly happy with Bag of Bones, which was the novel that came immediately before this one, and which seemed to mark a return to form for the author.<br />This book started off very strongly, and managed to keep me interested in the plight of a girl who gets lost in the woods. King does a great job of building suspense as he reveals, well, that there's *something* in the woods with her. Something that shouldn't be there.<br />So far, so good. Great character development, and great suspense. But, somewhere along the way (at around the half way point of the novel), the character stops developing and the threat fails to materialize. I am no longer spooked, and I am no longer interested.<br />As we near the end of the story, there seems to be a rush toward the conclusion. While I don't want to spoil the ending, suffice it to say that the uncomplicated plot is mostly resolved through a deus ex machina.<br />I give the novel a three star rating mostly because I still enjoyed the writing, even though I was ultimately disappointed in the story's conclusion. While fans of the author will still want to read this book, newcomers may wish to try Bag of Bones (a recent favorite), The Dead Zone (an amazing early novel) or Night Shift (a very satisfying collection of short stories).
B000002NHN|5.0|I bought this cd at a book's recommendation, having heard nothing of Loreena's work. I was afraid I wouldn't like it - I was SO wrong, it's incredible. If you like beautiful lyrics and haunting melodies, especially with a Celtic flavor, this is for you. Loreena has one of THE most beautiful voices I have ever heard, and a passion for her music that shines through that voice beautifully. If you like Loreena, check out Enya, Clannad, and The Corrs (for a more Pop flavor).
0375804153|5.0|This book was my first book.  I begged and pleaded for my mom to read this to me every night.  I plan on buying this for a young one I know in a few months. ps I LOVE THIS BOOK
B000051VWW|5.0|Sade is one of my favorite artists, and after this CD will be my absolute favorite.  Not only is the woman beautiful, but that beauty flows into her soft silky voice.  This CD is a must for all her fans.  I got it and I ain't sharing!!
0385493622|4.0|For me, mathematics was fun and challenging during the university years. After that, I've practised little, except starting a calculator on my computer.<br />Being a backgrounder for Fermat's last theorem, reading this book fired off a new branch of interest in number theory for me. <br />Fermat's relatively easy problem (at least to formulate), wasn't published with a solution, which either proved that Fermat was a genius, lazy or just saying &quot;ha-ha, I know something you don't&quot;. The book suggests a combination of them.<br />Weaving together an interesting history of mathematics (with great mathematicians as Euler, Hilbert and Godel) as well as the work of Andrew Wiles who've devoted a great deal of his life to try to solve this theorem, you'll read this book from start to end in no time.<br />If you'd like to get inspired in math, try this one, and then head off into &quot;Godel, Escher, Bach: an eternal golden braid.&quot;
B00001NFCY|5.0|Creed, after releaseing their first album &quot;My Own Prison&quot; in 1997, knew that their sophomore album had to be taken to the next level.  Although it was hard, they acheived this new height with their new album &quot;Human Clay&quot;.  With their variety of songs, their sound appeals to many different age groups.  Creed's dark, edgy, melodic tone can be compared to Pearl Jam and the Stone Temple Pilots, which were strong influences.  Their seductive, intensely written lyrics draw the listener into the music.  Scott Stapp's passionate vocalizing hypnotizes the listener while drawing out every ounce of emotion.  With songs like &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot; and &quot;Beautiful&quot; the words capture you and pull you into Creed's intense world.  Anyone who wants to listen to an emotion-filled album and enjoys edgy sounds should go out and buy Creed's &quot;Human Clay&quot;.  It is an uplifting album and allows a person to sit back, relax, and forget about all their worries.
0375707972|4.0|I was captivated from the start. The reference to the Post War German guilt and the secret of Hanna which I expect most readers to figure out early in the novel, did not detract from the beautiful interaction between the characters. The love cementing them for the rest of their lives unbiased by age, or time. Perhaps an additional lesson may be learnt, Don't hold on to the past, the enjoyment of the present may pass you by.
B0000028P8|3.0|C'mon folks, just seven songs on a full-priced disc?  Classic Jacksons tune notwithstanding, that's a ripoff compared to her original or the collection of #1s.  The renditions on this release are beautiful, but just not worth the money.
0425152251|3.0|Had I read this book at age 15, I would have found it more enchanting. While the style strives for the simple, the plot  -instead of building up to what had implicitly been announced as something new and &quot;philosophically&quot; refreshing- decays to a not well-planned absurd interpretation of existence. The in-between philosophy lessons are oversimplified and at times completely misleading. The constant allusions to Creation, even in contexts which are supposedly non-religous, bothered me enough to conclude that the author's beliefs are imposed upon Alberto and speak up through his voice as a philosophy teacher. Please do not take the lessons too seriously.  I caution naive readers and philosophy amateurs to read this book skeptically (ironically, that is exactly what the author advises us to do), or they may be taken over by what some have called &quot;a book of cult&quot;. PS- If you are planning to give this book as a gift to an adolescent, do take responsibility in his/her further philosophical (and literary) education.
0345350499|4.0|No matter how many versions of the Arthurian legend I have read and however romanticised Gweneviere's role was in most versions, I have never felt endeared to her. Mists of Avalon has at last portrayed her in what I feel is the most fitting role. Not as a perfect yet tragic heroine, but a totally believable person with some very realistic insecurities and neurotic tendencies. Her religious fanaticism is accompanied by her doubts of God and her insecurities as a woman is something that most women can identify with. I felt that the agorophobia was a very nice unexpected touch, although it's rather strange that she seemed to be the only one who suffered from near-sightedness as she aged.<br />Perhaps the most realistic tone of this book is how Bradley portrayed all the characters. Despite the fantasy and magic surrounding them, each character had strengths and weaknesses that are true to human nature. There was no-one you could say was truly good or purely evil.<br />For me, the best thing about this book is the retelling of this story from mostly Morgraine's point of view. I have always felt that this role has been much maligned unfairly in other versions. So to have her in a more-favourable light gets both thumbs up from me.<br />Did Arthur and his story really exist? I don't know and if you're hoping to glean historical facts from this book, then you'll be disappointed. When I read Mary Stewart's Merlin trilogy (followed by Wicked Day), at least I started to wonder if the legend could have been based on actual history - it was that believable. But with Mists, it remained as a fantasy to my mind. Stewart also managed to leave her readers feeling good, even though the legend itself has a tragic end. For this reason, Stewart's version still remains as my favourite.<br />However, Mists is a beautifully-written story and certainly swept me off my feet with the magically lyrical language used and everytime I (regretfully) had to put the book down to go do ordinary, mundane day-to-day stuff, I lift up my head expecting to see the mists around me. Is that the Avalon barge gliding noiselessly towards me, and who is that veiled lady beckoning me ......... ????
B00002MZ2T|5.0|In a world of teeny-boppers and boy bands, it's so refreshing to see actual musicians. Musicians with talent. Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones write their own music and lyrics, but what impresses me most is how all of their music sounds different. They have a wide range that they use including classical, rock, and pop. Darren Hayes has a smooth voice that can blend with the various styles of music. And Daniel Jones, well, give they guy some credit, how many instruments does he play? Not to mention writing music is difficult, especially if you don't want it to sound the same. Another thing that I am impressed with is the maturity of their lyrics, and subject matter (i.e. &quot;Affirmation&quot; talking about beliefs, and &quot;Two Beds and A Coffee Machine&quot; discussing abuse). They do have their selection of love songs, but these &quot;love songs&quot; include a deeper understanding, and broader range of emotions. I can understand why Savage Garden is getting great reviews, these guys deserve it, and unfortunately they are not as widely known as they should be. Perhaps it is because they are too busy writing great music to be the next Backstreet Boys.
B000002UAX|5.0|And that's certainly saying a lot. This is THE album to have if you were ever stranded on a desert island. Many people feel Sgt. Pepper's or Abbey Road were the Beatles' greatest achievements, but I beg to differ. This is a double disc of sprawling proportions. Simply put, there's something for every music fan on this album. If you can't find at least one song on this album that you like, then you simply don't like music. Here's a sampling of the styles of music on this classic album: Beach Boys style rock (with trademark wooohhs)...Back in the USSR Power pop...Dear Prudence Word associating Beatles reference lyrics..Glass Onion Piano-driven pop singalong (as only Paul can deliver)...Obladi Oblada Haunting guitar rockers...While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Birthday and Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey Three great songs in one with awesome vocals...Happiness is a Warm Gun Music-hall piano ballad...Martha My Dear Song of laboring exhaustion and despair..I'm So Tired Folkish guitar beauties...Blackbird and Mother Nature's Son Countrified folk...Rocky Raccoon Straight forward country...Don't Pass Me By Lovely ballad...I Will Haunting tribute...Julia Blues...Yer Blues Heavy metal..Helter Skelter Crazy sound montage...Revolution 9 20's style pop...Honey Pie Children's lullabye...Goodnight<br />You get the picture, and I didn't name some of the albums best songs (Revolution 1, Sexy Sadie, Cry Baby Cry)<br />In a few words, buy this album if you don't already have it! You won't regret it.
B00004XOWM|3.0|Enraged fans of Nine Inch Nails will share a moment of tooth grinding anger at the second track which is an obvious attack on Trent Reznor. I too heard this and promptly wanted to skip to the next song or tear the disk apart.  This is a very mixed album from an objective standpoint however.  Limp Bizkit claims to be nothing more than an &quot;idiot rap/rock&quot; band.  They are just that, however this is a good album.  Idiot rock CAN and WILL be enjoyed people. It's common knowledge. Motley Crue and Guns N Roses were huge before LimpBizkit, and now LimpBizkit has the spotlight, dozens of bands try to mimic them semi-successfully.  While I prefer my music a little more on the cryptic/mature side (Tool, A Perfect Circle, Radiohead, Deftones)I enjoyed this record. Tracks like &quot;Rollin&quot;, &quot;My Generation&quot;, and &quot;Take A Look Around&quot; are intense, nothing less. Durst even makes fun of himself, regularly, a sign that NIN fans shouldn't be overwhelmingly furious. The band even has its sincere moments with tracks like &quot;It'll be ok&quot;, similar to &quot;Re-arranged&quot; but far more guitar driven(well done Wes Borland)and &quot;Hold on&quot; featuring Scott Weiland(singer, Stone Temple Pilots), is a haunting ballad that seems to be building up to a rock track but never does. Scott is in rare form vocally however. Neither of the straight forward rap tracks are as amuzing/amazing as &quot;N2gethernow&quot; from Significant Other but they were both meaningfull collaborations. In the end this album is a mix of high points and lulls.  Though there is much promise in future Limp Bizkit success. The band has improoved by leaps and bounds as far as quality is concerned, and while there may not be as many tracks to enjoy as on Significant Other the instrumentaion has reached (cliche) a &quot;new level&quot;.  Wes Borland weilds his guitar like a weathered pro in comparison to the two previous albums, placing an emphasis on effects similar to Korn. However he seems to be sharpening his riffs to a more urgent direction. Dj Lethal has been put on the forefront instead of the backround with this album, a wise move when considering his years of experience on the wheels of steel.  Sam Rivers is the most improved perhaps, as the album rests on it's bass lines more comfortably than either of the previous records. Jon Otto remains the respectable drumming force he was in the last two albums, if not better.  Fred Durst is the only one who could stand to take a lesson or two.  Those lessons could even be taught by himself, as he sounded much better on Significant Other.  He uses a whining technique that was ussually effective, now he merely overdoes it.  Durst can be commended however, because the few mature songs LB has are signs of a band that has yet to peak.  On another note in Freds favor that few can deny, he has an uncanny talent at creating monsterously successfull pop/metal anthems. Keep on rollin baby!
0385495315|5.0|I just finished reading this book (it has been out for over a year, and I just now got to it).  This is, by far, the best overview of code makers and code breakers.  You get an historical and personal overview of this broad and secretive subject.  Not only was this book informative, but I could not put it down.  An addictive and pleasurable read.
