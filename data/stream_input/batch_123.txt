B006TCLZ84|5|I have never been let down by Carhartt and I know that no matter what I buy the size will fit/. I am a big person and need the room to move in my clothes.
B00K5LHM3C|3|It' s OK.....
B00JBSF2X2|5|Beautiful dress! True to size.
B00LZN7EUA|5|I ordered another one in the blue color. The army green is really pretty. Better than the picture. it is super soft and a great shirt.
B000U65YE6|4|I like them, i bought them for my wedding, i will use them the next month. They are like i saw them. You can buy them!!!
B00C40ZIJC|4|My son likes them, but wishes the material was the stretchable kind like his other pair.
B009WS5S6C|5|I've always been scared to try infinity scarves in fear they'll be too long and look odd.  This one is perfect.  It has enough length to wrap it around your neck twice and still be loose but bunched enough to add some depth to an outfit.  It looks just like the picture and it is beautiful and light.  Not itchy like some scarves can be!  Awesome scarf for a fashion statement =)
B00DA35KJA|5|The pic of this hat doesn't do it justice. It has really cool texture. Hubby has never seen one like it and he has a lot of hats. This one is my fav.
B004M6XUI2|1|I've never bought something so bad, you can smell stimuli smoked dizzy, I feel like poisoning the same.bad bad bad bad bad
B00ENXI06Q|5|I've researched a large number of similar belts and, according to the descriptions, this was the best choice. I am happy to say I made the right decision.  It is a very good belt.
B000FXW3PM|4|I switched to Carhartt pants some years back after growing tired of the poor quality of denim in most pants - I find that these Washed Duck pants outlast denim, are not as uncomfortable when damp, and the small tool pockets are much more practical than the bellow &#34;cargo&#34; pockets on so many pants - the right thigh pocket is perfect for a smart phone for example. 100% Cotton fabric.
B003CSRKM8|5|Its made of pretty thick material, so it'll keep your noggin nice and warm.  The graphic on the front is a little larger than I thought, so the wings wrap around to the sides.  Only the center of the graphic is visible from the front.  The size is between a cap and a beanie, so it doesn't fit very close to the top of the head; it has a little extra room at the crown of the head, but still doesn't make for a bad fit.  Then again, no two heads are the same size and shape.  The small leather label fixed to the back isn't really noticeable, but adds to the appeal of a quality product.  The font across the front isn't very legible, but its to be expected when it stretches across your forehead and all the vowels have been excluded.  It says &#34;slvrstr&#34; and not &#34;sinister&#34; like I thought, but that was my fault for not looking closely enough at the photos.<br />Overall, I am very happy with this beanie!
B009KX0CA6|1|Buying was 12 pieces did not I receive only 9 pieces and no cotton all nylon..<br />Commercial fraud-Completion of the commodity stacked
B00FBD2G0I|2|I purchased these socks in February. Now, less than four months later, most of the pairs of socks have prominent holes in the heels. Granted, I walk six miles a day, but I would have expected these socks to last more than four months! The description of these socks claims they have a reinforced heel, and that may or may not be true. The gray area, which I assume is where the reinforced area is located, actually fits at the back of one's heel, as pictured. This does nothing, however, to reinforce the bottom of your heel where the actual friction from walking will affect the fabric.<br /><br />While I have been satisfied with Hanes products in the past, I will likely not purchase Hanes socks again in the future. I would recommend that anyone who does a lot of running or walking stay away from these socks, and try to purchase something with more durability, as it will save you money in the long run.
B009PQSG1U|5|BUYER BEWARE : the little sizing chart picture is completely crap.<br />i was very lucky. i did not see the sizing chart and ordered the 3xl (i usually order 2xl, but i wanted it too be a bit larger so i can wear something thick under it). on the sizing chart, it says that the 3xl is 62&#34;-64&#34; around the chest. i am 52&#34; around the chest. i saw it after it was shipped and immediately filed a return and was waiting for the jacket to arrive only to return it the same day. but what do you know? it fit perfectly.<br />so, just to provide a frame of reference : ****3XL IS GOOD FOR A PERSON WHO IS 52&#34; AROUND THE CHEST. NOT 62&#34;.****<br />now calculate for your own size.<br />all that sizing fuss aside, the coat is AWESOME. i love the leather sleeves. the buttons and the level of overlapping edges are very reliable and the coat itself is very very warm. good for a cold winter day but not a rainy day or a snowy day as the chest material is a material which gets wet and would not dry soon. i would totally recommend it.
B005RTBMLK|2|my husband loved them to start but after 5 weeks, have two holes in both...pretty disappointed in how they held up. For $21.00 I could have bought an ok pair of slippers
B000J407WI|5|If you know your size and are confident of the fit, buying clothing such as these undies is really as easy as pie.
B007CPTPRK|3|The print on the tshirt was not very dark? Seemed a bit faded?
B00C7XIEAQ|4|Nice quality pants with a nice fit.
B001N4NYSM|4|I like wearing ballcaps outdoors camping, cycling, often on backwards while<br />jogging or hanging out.  I like the masculine camo look.  This cap arrived<br />ontime and in great condition - I did have to adjust the strap a lot, and I'm<br />pretty certain it's more on the small size compared with my other baseball caps.
B00KYUFEMU|4|I'm completely satisfied with my purchases
B0007CKMPY|4|I have not complaints, it fits very well & Amazon has the sizes I needed that even Walmart didn't carry.
B00AM3DHZ0|5|The lenses fit perfectly and the polarized is great at cutting the glare! I'll be buying replacements from you again.  Saved a lot of money!
B007JB9YXW|5|I am 5 foot 7 with a muscular build. I got a medium and it is snug in the arms and a little long however it looks great. Excellent value!
B001G81P86|5|Love these jeans and really appreciated the reasonable price.
B00JQ6JJKQ|5|Beautiful colors. Great length, love this brand. The colors are very bright, which I like.
B004ARSLOG|5|My 9 year old son loves these underwear.  We tried about half a dozen different styles and even more brands and these are the ONLY ones he really likes.  The fit as expected, don't ride up or slide around, and the fabric is nice and soft.  My super picky and texture sensitive son recommends these to other kids!
B00KU3EQCU|4|Somewhat large for my son though he's thin. Maybe it is too flare for his taste
B00AVKBJ0Y|5|Preseny for son.
B00I563HQA|5|Love the color, 5'4 & 130 Ibs. Got a small and fit perfectly. But if you like loose hoodies, get a larger size.
B00BAXL67M|5|This a gorgeous belt! I have not worn it yet but I know I will love it! I have a beautiful pair of turquoise cowboy boots and a gorgeous brown and turquoise hat!!! Love love love it!!!!!
B0089N5QXQ|5|Hat was great!  The personalized business card was a super touch!  It had a personal greeting from the senders...kept the card..will be doing more purchases from them!
B0037TVRS0|3|I ordered the 3X. The shirt is beautiful but you must be about 6'2&#34; or taller, otherwise it is way too long.
B007ECPO3A|4|It´s a very good t-shirt of a very good brand, which normally is more expensive but that this time they were gentle withe the price. I really enjoyed it. I personaly recomend it because of his quality and the usual things we can buy with this brand.
B00NAV47O6|1|Need to universalized the size. Its way out of proportion.
B0008EOBVW|4|Bought for skinny son with long legs. Good fit and great for a teen with the wrinkle resistance.
B00KVZZPZO|5|I had to get all three colours.These dresses were cool cute and added a little sexy feel when dressed up .
B00J8WNL4S|5|My daughter loves this shirt that we purchased for her birthday.  It arrived in a very timely manner and was just as described.
B00A8DLJTK|4|Ordered this for my son who walks a fine line of only plain clothes and liking a little bit of design. This is is perfect. Not too crazy-according to him! The colors are bright and the fit is good. We live in snowy Ohio, so he hasn't had a chance to try out the sunblock feature!
B009B7QQ56|4|Ordered this for the wife (huge Potter fan) for Christmas. Coupled this with a scarf ordered through Amazon as well. Unfortunately, this beanie, though well-made and arriving in a timely manner, is brighter than one is led to believe due to the picture. The maroon is not as deep and the gold is much brighter. Hopefully through washing, the dyes will fade a bit and become a better match for the scarf.
B00FKK787I|5|This is a great looking scarf - soft, pretty, and I love the tassels!  I just wish they offered this in more colors.
B00GICLT72|5|liked it and wore it as soon as she got it
B00A73URYY|5|Levi's I love it
B00E0I7W7M|5|It is a very well detailed tailored trench coat. Very chic and sophisticated. Classy! Looks great out on the town even on a rainy day.
B00JM4UNUW|5|My grandson loves his shirt. The fit is great and the material is very comfortable.
B007MU5SEO|5|Nice slim fit, but is cut for curves. It was also nice to be able to select a length that was right for my fairly short legs.
B000LY1GZ8|4|Really comfortable pair of jeans.  No complaints at all there.  I wish that the pockets were a little deeper, but they get the job done.
B00EKQSB06|5|Fit perfectly, and just like other reviews the dress is a good quality. Especially for the price paid (not too expensive). I wore this dress for the Day of the dead, put a corset around my waist and was good to go. My cousin liked the look so much she borrowed it. I'm 5'2&#34; and she is around 5'4&#34; and the dress fit us both great. Best part of this purchase is I can reuse it during warm months as a regular dress.
B0026LDRZ6|5|My daught loves dressing up and being a six year old she is tall for her age and it fits her with plenty of room for months to come. Its pretty sturdy as well, snaggin it in a door while playing it didnt rip tear or stretch. Pretty cool gear!
B000P21CTQ|5|JUST RECEIVED THIS HAT YESTERDAY.IT'S WELL MADE,FULLY ADJUSTABLE WITH VELCRO STRAPS AND VERY COMFORTABLE.I'M ANXIOUS TO SHOW IT TO MY OLD HIPPY FRIENDS.
B00J4IZ3NI|5|This dress is fit true to size. I will recommend this dress. Love the material high quality.
B0064Y4A4I|5|I bought my first Danskin short from Ross and really like it.  I went back to Ross, but I could not find it anymore.  I like the length, material, and how it fits on me perfectly.  The pocket is very small, but that's not an issue for me since I usually have my shoulder bag with me.  I like it so much that I bought a black one also.
B006SRTDQ6|5|Ordered this as a gift for my son.  He absolutely loved it.  The fit was excellent.  I went on the Champion web-site for the sizing chart and they provided great sizing info.  He loves lounging around the house while he's in the family room that stays a bit cooler than the rest of the house.  He says the Union Suit is both warm, sturdy and really comfortable!  I'm extremely happy with my purchase.
B0076PG1MS|3|this beanie looks great and is biult preaty durable i dont recomend it for people who have a big head its really small
B002SE5376|5|I love this bra! I've been wearing this brand and style for years. It is comfortable, smooth enough that I can wear it under a t-shirt, and a sexy deep v. My nipples also run a little larger than average and so the padding is perfect for me.
B00O83LLB2|4|Love it! Not too formal or thick. Easy to move in.
B0092TNKQ6|5|I bought these as a gift for my girlfriend and she's happy with them.  I would like to warn others that TexereSilk uses a ribbon covered with glitter on the gift wrapped box (if you choose that option).  I personally can't stand glitter and a month later we're still finding specs of glitter on the floor and I've cleaned the house twice since she opened the PJ's.  Other than that TexereSilk was great to deal with - the PJ's were shipped promptly after ordering.
B00SU0B4OI|5|I had been spending $50 + for designer money clips with credit card slots. This one does the job just as well, and I can put the other 2 $20's I saved in the wallet!
B00O10X9NA|5|I love the dress. I ordered a 16W and it's a little big but fits ok and looks nice.
B00JXQO8FK|5|these are awesome pants. I want all the colors.
B009BKWE9U|5|Purchased this because I can never find anything right away in my bag! What a difference this organizer makes! Even changing handbags just got easier! I just keep my essentials in this organizer and everything is in the same place no matter what bag it's in! (That is if I put it back where I designated it to go) There is plenty of room and pockets for just about anything you'd normally carry, from phones, makeup and wallet to wipes, notepad and pens. I highly recommend anyone that carries a bag, be it handbag, manbag, or whatever to get one of these!
B001809VME|3|Inexpensive costume wig. Good for the price.
B00CFICJOK|5|item is perfect
B002VLZH5O|5|Great jersey shorts.  It is so hard to find longer jersey, not silky, shorts for men. Finally I found them and I purchased 2 pairs.  He w I'll wear them until they fall apart 😁
B004S08YZG|1|I think all the girls who say they're 250+ and that this dress fits good must be smoking crack. I'm about 260 and a size 18 in pants and a double XL in tee shirt and this no way in hell fits at all...not in the least bit. I'd say if you wear a size larger than a women's XL don't buy this! I was extremely sad this didn't fit. :(
B006PI26FS|5|The product was received promptly and is above expected quality.  It is small, compact yet roomy inside and love the fact it closes securely to prevent items from falling out.  Love it.
B00H4UDNV2|5|Very well constructed and granddaughter loves it! That's what counts.
B001NKW93M|2|Billabong is a great sweatshirt... although this sweatshirt may be a mock.  The sweatshirt arrives as advertised, however, the designer labels are cut and/or removed.  Makes me believe these are not original Billabong products.  It was shipped from overseas.  That was the first clue that it may not be an original product.  Still, if you dont mind the chance that this is a fake, it does look like an original Billabong.  Go a little larger as the cut was a little snug.
B0053GMFLS|2|I bought these for my daughters who are barely 3.  They are too small and do not work with potty time as they are hard to pull back on.  And when I washed them they got even smaller!
B005ZUVSII|5|I really like this hoody. I wear at least once a week. Fit is great. Would definitely recommend.
B001UHVTRU|5|No kidding on the title. These Kangol hats are the type of hat that if you get used to wearing, you will feel naked without. I also bought a 507 model and have a review of it on here too. The main thing to know is I bought this 504 in a XXL because I wear a 7 3/4 baseball cap, but it's a bit big on me. I bought the XL in the 507 and it fit much better.<br /><br />I liked the 507 a little better overall, but I'm still going to get a couple of these 504s too, in XL size. The quality is nice, the material feels durable and they really do go with nearly any outfit. Recommended the most for balding men or bald men, especially head shavers like myself. It feels like a nice, stylish, yet subtle way to keep our heads from sunburn. It also takes away the frustration of trying to buy a baseball cap these days, not knowing whether to order a flat brim and trying to bend it or going with a low crown, pre-bent. I also think I've found the perfect gifts for my bald uncles and grandpa.
B001CK70TG|5|It was a gift for the lady friend.  She loves them!  Says they are warm and comfortable.  I was worried that they may be too long as she is only 5'0.  But they are a perfect fit for her.
B00KSZ2IEI|5|Love it, love it, love it!  It looks as good on me as it does on the model.
B00KIXTEGK|5|Very nice
B001M0MXPC|2|I purchased these shirts because they said they were wrinkle free, needless to say they are not. And after spending $35.00 a piece I was not pleased.
B00A65Z4EQ|5|LOVE this shirt. It came beautifully packaged, the length of the top and the arms are extra long which I love. The material is extremely soft.
B00HSDNU72|1|I didn't like this dress. When I got i it, the white stripes on the  side where dirty and the color doesn't want to come off. It's too long and it doesn't fit to the body.
B00CHNNQ9A|5|Fits well and keeps your head warm.  Color matched what I ordered.
B00CPBV8IK|5|I love it!
B00UT4AF52|4|This is a relatively long cover up and could be worn as a modest dress, if it were not see thru. Its longer than many skirts. Other coverups are more like Tshirts.  It is more see thru than I thought.  That is not a problem at some of the joints I go you. I have seen coverups worn that way, and certainly this one can.  In black its not really beachwear anyway, except with a black suit under.
B00UHDGJZ0|5|I love this dress. I am 5'9&#34; and short waisted so I was afraid that this dress would not hang right on me. It fits fantastic. I love it, it is soft and hangs in all the right places. I got the XL since I am kind of busty and it is great. I highly recommend this dress, and I will need to get any other colors they have. Great to just throw this over your head and go.
B005Q0AF0O|5|ok
B00GFHD0SG|5|We like to put our children in matching shirts when we go on vacation so we can keep track of them in a crowd. The lime green is great for that and these shirts also have moisture wicking, dry fast and UV protection. They are comfortable and yes we could easily see everyone at the St. Louis Zoo.
B00OYULZZQ|4|This is my 3rd PattyBoutik top and I've loved them thus far and have been finding a good deal of confidence with their sizing.<br /><br />I will still very much be wearing this top, but the title wasn't something I paid as close attention to.  It says &#34;Blouse&#34; but looks a bit more like a thicker t-shirt or thin sweater sort of fabric, so I was a little surprised at how thin the materials are.  That said, they construction is nice and I like the cut.<br /><br />The fit is still wearable, but hind-sight as it is, I would have ordered 1 size larger than I normally order for this brand.  I'll have to be careful what I wear underneath due to the snug fit.
B00ODT95NC|5|Very comfortable and durable
B00MHT9Q98|5|I bought these as a gift for my daughter.  They are beautiful socks and seem to be of good quality.  They have a feel similar to a medium weight men's trouser sick.  The colors are vibrant and the depiction of Klimt's &#34;The Kiss&#34;. Is represented nicely.  My daughter loved them and wore them almost immediately.  A great purchase!
B002YQ2GFA|4|Great quality tights, but the waistband is much tighter than measurements would entail.
B00COBOCZ2|4|I was looking for warm weather wardrobe options that were cool and casual, but covered those occasions where I wanted something more than a tank top.
B00KDZIY1Y|3|It is not Y-Back stringer as described :(
B003TULPGG|5|Fits great.  Good quality fabric.
B00NOFLB60|1|Hate it!
B000VK3TTS|5|Love this. Fits perfect. I can run without jiggle and I'm a 38F these are the best sports bras I've come across EVER!
B00P1OJDSU|5|I love this Hoodie. It fits in men sizes. Thank u
B00DU9MW4A|4|I guess the size reference is somewhat not correct, I think it is a little smaller than what I have expected.
B00L22LTT6|5|Fits perfect i'm 5&#34;9' and 140lbs looks great on me can't wait to wear it somewhere saving for a nice turn up!!!
B0007YRA6G|5|You just can't go wrong with a Playtex bra, I have worn them for years and I can honestly say this brand is the only one that gives me true support and fit well.
B007XCXVXG|3|The colors of this dress are beautiful and the fabric is stretchy and comfy but the picture is decievieng.  The skirt of the dress is about 4 inches shorter in the front than it is in the back.  It hits above the knee by at least two inches in the front and then hangs down in the back.  I bought this for my 12 year old but it is going to my 10 year old since it is way too short in the front to be decent on my 12 year old.  I bougth a size 14 which is one size up from what I would normally buy for the 12 year old and that still did not help-it is 4 inches above her knee in the front and since she is a tomboy that would just never work for her!
B002KZIWSU|2|I was excited when I received these gloves as a present.  They fit perfectly, the leather is soft and supple, the lining is warm and soft.  However, every time I touch my face or any thing light in color, it leaves a dark black smudge from the dye used to make the gloves black. I am constantly having to check a mirror to see if I have touched my cheeks, nose or forehead and have black smudges.  These very first brought to my attention by my co-workers who thoght I had been hit in the face by something.
B000PD06WE|5|Awesome!
B004QF0THO|5|Very warm, thick and soft. It's cold where I live and these are great!
B00EHCLJAC|5|So sleek and love to wear all the time
B0002TOZ1O|5|Wife loves these socks very happy
B007IRVVZG|5|very cute outfit. great for a cool day without having to wear a jacket. love the matching hat and my daughter loves it.
B0042Z0IV0|5|The jacket is marvelous. Very warm and wonderfully styled. I just wish Taiga would make a women's 18 as I would appreciate being able to wear layers under it. They are a company primarily concerned with customer satisfaction. They have called me numerous times to secure my opinion on the order. Very competent staff especially Graham who bends over backwards to assist your every need.  GO TAIGA.
B00AOCFPRC|5|A great alternative to the more expensive belts on todays market. Well constructed with all the right options, proven on duty, and a much cheaper solution.
B000F5MVJS|4|Generally, I don't understand why plastic is so expensive. <br />Plus, so many knock-offs. <br />But, good presentation and brend.
B00S0CU81G|5|Simple
B00NNIY2CI|2|Material is more like cheap bathing suit and was super small. Maybe suitable for smaller chested person? But for larger bust i would not recommend.
B0051U18KA|5|Great socks to say the least.
B00DDFFUFE|5|Love it
B000UAPOO2|5|My daughter loves this bra- they can be difficult to find in the department store, so ordering them online is super convenient.
B00B4X89QO|4|I got this for my husband for Christmas. He's a big guy, so it's hard to find his size and this is one of the few brands I found that has an 18.5 neck with 36/37 sleeves. It's not as wrinkle-free as other brands but it does pretty well. Definitely comes out of the dryer looking good. I saw a reviewer or two say it shrinks a lot but I did not have that problem. (I use cold water and low dryer heat.)
B000XQ9CZA|4|I received the tie before the actual promised date.  I was matching the tie to wedding colors which made it hard to find.  The fuschia tie was a perfect match.  It was a good price for a quality tie.  I would recommend this company to others.
B00EOM5R4E|5|This jacket is for my son and it fits perfectly.<br />It's very very nice
B00KS8W44Y|5|Always wanted a belt with a seat belt style to it. Also I simply love the show supernatural! So this was a win win for me when I found it. Just received it today , it sized down to my waste easily and seems well made. Very happy with my purchase!
B00PV0K2CA|5|Phenomenal. 6'00&#34; 200lbs. Should have went with the XL for comfort but the large does fit & the ladies love it.
B00IPDFCAW|4|I ordered a small and received a large. The bottoms are perfect fit but the top is a little big. Still satisfied with my purchase.
B0002PNZPK|5|I got a hole on it the first time I wore it but other than that it fits great!
B00FY94I7S|5|I love this dress and all the others  ones that I have buy cause it fix me just the way I like it to fix I would recommend this product to my friends at work.
B00BNSD3J8|5|This product packed great didn't need any ironing and my husband wore it with Khaki pants and he looked awesome.
B00FFGYKE6|2|I ordered the dusty pink and the skirt is very thin with gray and peachy stripes when the picture looks like 2 shades of pink.
B005WLSAA4|4|This is a good product I just wish they had used better lacing up the sides.Mine came with plastic string like stuff that I replaced with leather other then that Great stuff.
B00BOHDWT4|5|Good quality and a good deal.  I put this on my motorcycle vest, to serve notice to my fellow bikers and all others that I am proud to show off the many dedicated years of my military service.  It also serves as a common point of discussion with other veterans.
B009K7VBE8|5|Great experience in general. No issues.
B0094RJ8FI|5|These Lounge pants are really nice.  They are heavy material and do not shrink.  My husband is 6'4&#34; and they still were down to the ground after first wash.  This is a bonus!!!
B00L8Q37SC|4|I ordered the brown version.  The one I received is not the same color as shown - it's a lot darker, and has a slight purplish tint to it.  It does however keep your head quite warm.
B00KX2PNOS|5|Love it! Very light material you will need to wear something underneath it, its paper thin but very cute!
B008V9DVFI|5|I am a slim man, 6'3 175lbs. I purchased a Large. The material is a nice stretch material. I wish I had a little more muscle in my arms, because these guns would look great in this shirt! But the sleeves are a little short on me, because my arms are long, next time i will purchase a XL, just for the length issue, but I just slide the sleeves up to my forearm and it looks great still. Thanks Grin&Bear!
B00XKPO1ES|5|I just received my trainer, and although this is only the second trainer I've ever bought it is so much more comfortable than my first one and it is able to hold you in but still allow you to move freely. Honestly this is amazing and I would buy this same product when I'm ready to go down my last size
B003GXFTU4|5|I bought this same wallet at a department store almost ten years ago.  It was time to replace it, and I couldn't find a bi-fold wallet this slim that had six credit card slots, a hidden zipper pocket for my emergency $20, and a separate section with clear windows on both sides for a driver's license, insurance cards, and medical insurance cards.  Besides my emergency $20, I don't keep cash in my wallet.  I used the bill space, which is nicely lined, for business cards, receipts, car wash punch cards, etc.<br /><br />I searched high and low at every store that I went to, but could not find this wallet again.  So I searched online for the brand and model, and found it here on Amazon!  I bought the wallet, and was glad to see it was the same exact design and quality of the older one that I had.  I thought I was going to have to switch over to some bulky bi-fold, but this saved the day.  I may get another one to store away, just in case Columbia decides to discontinue it.  It may not seem like a big thing, but I'm pretty particular about wallets.  This is a great value, and you won't be disappointed.
B0044VD92M|5|love this hat, fit of the hat is a perfect snug. i shoveled the snow & the hat didn't budge.  plus looks great on. the gray is a true dark gray, not heathered in color.
B004Y6R5EA|4|This dress looks nearly as good in person as online and I think it's well worth the current sub-$20 price.<br /><br />The only issue with this is if you're skinny or have a small bust, it tends to get bunched up a little on your back just behind your shoulders.<br /><br />Overall I think my gf looks great in it, she doesn't like the little bit bunching up and the higher hips may or may not suit you.<br /><br />Dress is light and cool for summer and offers plenty of coverage as far as what you want to wear under it or not under it.  She's a skinny 115lbs or so with moderately built behind.  On the good side, even if you're a little small, you can still tie the front and it's not going to fall down.
B00WLIC3EA|4|I normally wear large but due to other reviews purchased the X large. It was a tad small in the chest area otherwise great fit. It was fast delivery and great service. I ordered a second suit in red in an XXL and it fits perfectly.
B00LLIVQM6|3|A little uncomfortable. Not as much support as I expexted. I wear a small in clothing and this fit pretty well, just not very comfortable.
B0067UT4R2|5|I probably did not read the details.  I got a nice fit to these pants.  The inseam was just as I like it.  I think the pants would be more suited for winter wear.  I found it to be a bit heavier in weight than expected.  It would be perfect for the colder winter months.  Also, being heavier seems to have advantages in that it feels rugged and strong.  I would recommend this product to my friends with the caveat that it is a heavier and sturdier material, best suited for winter months.
B00E4XXLBE|3|kinda pricy
B00BJ9TDRC|5|After prewashing these in fabric softener to get rid of the strong odor of the material, I have NO complaints. I often times will wear these under my clothing, during the cold months, to help with my weight loss goal. Due to the sweat that will POUR off of me, I'd also wear a cotton layer underneath to absorb the sweat. They fit PERFECTLY...which was a BIT of a surprise considering I have thee HARDEST time finding REGULAR pants to fit my small waist and wider bottom /hips.<br />So....yes!! I would recommend theses pants. Just order YOUR size for a good fit.
B00FXHWLKC|5|Good item.
B004L6JEPG|5|This is a great long sleeve shirt. What I really liked is that its not too thin.  I wear them under my uniform for warmth. Great fit too.
B00FAKPK2I|5|I've always wanted to be a part of a club and now I am.  Being part of Polo club has been wonderful, but first rule of Polo Club is do not talk about Polo Club. I am fire.
B008EYGR2E|5|My son loves this sweater. It is a little large, but that's ok for a sweater. He looks like a present all wrapped up for Christmas.
B00FPRAWJC|5|I love my That metal show shirt, it is exactly what I wanted, big fan of the show, and a great birthday present to myself. Thanks Amazon
B00T1K0ISE|3|I love the print, but I would not be able to wear this during the hot summer months in California.<br />Its made of scuba like fabric that will retain lots of heat!<br />So back it goes..
B00JXZ5HP6|5|Buy 1 size larger. Excellent material and fit. Very flattering to the figure
B00ITJY1NQ|4|Very sexy. Bottom is rather big, but can be physically manipulated to look smaller (Think high rise boy shorts with full bottom). The top was very nice and fit perfectly. Wife is 5'8&#34; about 135 34D. Good deal
B00BILHRFG|4|very pretty!! just too big yet for my baby (shes 5months)..<br />the feather part was very stiff.. so when i had put it on it kinda didnt curved with her head.. sorry hard to explain..<br />i am hoping it will fit better once she is grown and has a bigger head.. :-D<br />but other than that very beautiful!!
B007GKMQ72|1|compared to other bras these were really small.  and I got 2 different and they varied; one smaller around than the other.  and for both the cup size was small.  I would not recommend unless you've tried them on and verified the size
B00CI152QG|4|40% polyester 60% cotton, for skinny kids<br />I like it, but the description was incorrect.I was looking for 100% cotton
B00A99BFEC|5|These were a gift for our children's high school band director. He loved them! They look very nice and the price made it even better (I have compared prices on these and this is not a cheap item to buy as a gift). We are very happy with this purchase! It also arrived sooner than expected so we were able to get it to him before Christmas holidays.This was a blessing.
B00B5HRMAI|5|This came super fast! And it fits me perfect, just like I expected, (not too loose, but not skin tight either, just a comfy, snug fit!)<br />It doesn't hang off the shoulders like it shows in the picture, but I'm sure you could stretch it out. Overall, I love it and highly recommend it!
B00BSALDQ6|5|I love his tail! :D It's getting chilly here where I live, so I wore some leggings, and my sweater, with this raccoon tail clipped to the back of my pants yesterday and got so many compliments! ^_^ I've always wanted to do something like this to be goofy and cute, and everyone loved it.<br /><br />The quality is great, it smells fine, (I'm a clean freak) :P I'd totally recommend this for only $5! It's a steal!<br /><br />I love my new raccoon tail and my husband thinks it's adorable and he calls me his little raccoon now. LOL!!<br /><br />Can be used for a key chain, your purse, a costume tail, or a decoration in your car. :D<br /><br />Thanks for this great product! I couldn't be happier. It is sooo soft! ^.^
B00CDAQ842|5|Love these  pajamas!!  Washed them several times and they have held up really well-- the feel is like silk--would definitely recommend these
B005CGGRZE|4|These are cute PJs.  The snaps are sturdy and close tightly (i.e., don't unsnap when the baby gets fussy and starts kicking her legs around inside the PJs).  I like the pattern (skateboarding Snoopy), but some people would probably disagree that this is a \\"girl\\" style.  The cut on these is very generous -- definitely works best for a chunky baby.  My daughter is long and skinny, and she has lots of space to move around inside them.  She can get her knee half out of the leg when she kicks around, and then her foot gets caught up at the top of the leg opening...and then I have to go straighten her out.
B007NMBZHA|4|This scarf is cute but the material is heavier than I anticipated, which makes it a better scarf to wear with a winter coat for outdoor warmth, than a fashion scarf to wear throughout the day indoors. Color is a soft pink, true to image.
B005KGL9G8|5|Son wore this for prom this year fit as expected he is a size small/medium. So we order the xlarge and it fit perfect. Looked really nice too
B00HV6O5I4|5|very happy,thanks
B00T4GN0WG|5|Awesome burkini!
B0052WM734|1|BOUGH AS MY DAUGHTER WANTED A 'DOME' SHAPED UMBRELLA.  NOT THAT DIFFERENT FROM REGULAR UMBRELLA, WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO RETURN BUT NEVER FOUND TIME
B00N2FMAQM|5|Very high quality cosplay.<br /><br />I give it a five because of this<br /><br />I did feel that the corset was a bit too big on me, but I can probably fix this myself.  The straps are adjustable to fit people who have smaller shoulders like me, but I need to make them smaller.  The measurements didn't request that, so I can't hold them accountable.<br /><br />Other than that, great measurements, great product.
B009NKZZ26|5|This is easily one of my favorite purchases from Amazon. I love it. It is so comfortable and pretty. I wear it to work. I wish some of the items from this seller were a little less expensive but I would definitely buy more from them.
B00KCAHWHM|3|Unless you have super skinny thighs, these socks squeeze your fat like crazy D:<br />I thought I could fit a small because I'm only 105lbs. and oh boy I needed a large.
B003JH8TF4|4|My husband had compliments all night on his silky shiny hair....... the wig was used for a Dog the Bounty hunter costume, and was perfect.
B00BMEBT76|2|I feel it is tight and small for me ,but I do not why when i wear ,the pants always go down , everytime when i sit down and get up , i need fix my pants .so after 2 times wear , i do not want wear any more
B00CVFBLRI|5|Used for my husband as a &#34;preview&#34; for a trip to Vegas in April. Quick device. Nice quality.
B005QHR1C2|1|These Jeans are the opposite of a proper taper. The calf has too much room and the thigh doesn't have nearly enough. I've got a pair of taper jeans from Gap in the same size and they do exactly that, taper.
B00GYTK0YM|5|Fits great, looks nice
B0042TZZFA|3|We ordered this with expedited shipping.  It arrived within two days. That was great. However, when I tried to put it on, it only covered the very top of my head. I was not happy about that. I had to buy orange spray paint and comb the bottom half of my hair up and over this mini-wig.  Then it looked great but it was disappointing to get a half of a wig when, from looking at the picture online, I thought I was getting full-coverage.
B001QIRCJM|5|So cute! Was bigger then I expected but that worked out great so I can put layers underneath it ...  My 1 year old loved it As well when I put it on to try it out and he ran all over the house roaring such a cute and warm costume can't wait for Halloween
B007M4FAKC|5|I had a heck of a time getting my 1 year old to &#34;slip&#34; into his boots. After about a week of trying I gave up and returned them and set out on a quest to find something that was flexible, comfortable, warm, and most importantly - functional! These are exactly what I was looking for and will be buying another pair in the next size up soon. Highly recommend!!
B006T52XXM|5|Great  thanks
B009PJ9SGY|2|I bought this in beige.  I have a 32 inch waist and when I use the first hook the part of the suede which is at the back of the rose shows on one side of the belt only.  The rose is not in the middle as it should be.  I tried it on the other two hooks and it looks even worst.  Whilst the rose is very pretty and the belt stretches a lot the elastic is already unraveling on the edge so this makes the belt look old.  I was very disappointed.  I gave it 2 stars for the color and the rose!
B0009IYR3O|5|Fits as expected! Great costume
B000KJ2PX6|4|A great bag able to hold a lot, and still meets the total linear inches limit of the airlines.  The separate zippered compartments keeps things in their place, however, the bag doesn't stand on end very well.
B003VISLMC|4|Bought this for a work related Halloween party meaning I couldn't buy something super sexy or slutty.  This just arrived today and appears to me fairly well made with a cute little jacket.  The dress is stretchy which is good because it s SNUG.  I ordered an extra large and am so very glad (I wear a size 12ish). It fits as long as I don't gain a pound or two.  The dress is also short but a pair of tights should do the trick to keep covered up.  Also, the dress has spaghetti straps which are adjustable so pretty much the outfit needs the jacket.  It's cute and just borderline sexy which is exactly what I was looking for.
B002H1WKGC|4|Keeps my head warm enough for California kind of cold, low 50's. I wear glasses so the brim keeps light rain off. Works great for me, the guys on my job want one now.
B000YGJ12I|1|The lace is itchy therefore VERY UNCOMFORTABLE !<br />I should know better than to purchase a bra online ...<br />Never again ...for sure ...
B005C9G710|2|These knit boxers are actually a bit thicker and stiffer than I expected. Not really much airflow. I also felt like the crotch didn't come up far enough, making for a really baggy fit that wouldn't be too fun on a hot day. Even though they are in a completely different price range, I would recommend Ex-Officio boxers and boxer briefs.
B002Q8MI4U|5|Great athletic socks for tennis shoes.
B00K3EUAIK|5|Thick and cushy!
B008I62HHC|5|On July 31, 2014, we took the kids to see the Budweiser Clydesdales.  After that adventure with the kids and having them on the news, I just had to have a shirt with the horses on it.  It is a very cute shirt!  It fits nicely!
B00WHBPVRM|3|Eh. That's really all I can say about this shirt. It's much shorter than it looks in the picture, but I was too lazy to actually look at the measurements of the shirt when I read the &#34;one size&#34;. The material is soft, but it fits a little awkward. Sticks out by my armpits, and is loose but not flattering. Not bad enough that it's returnable, but not something I would ever order again (though there are a few shirt designs that I LOVED.)
B00E5ONZF4|5|I bought these direct from the Trixx site. I am 5'4&#34; and 125-130 lbs. I got a size small in the red, and they look amazing. My partner actually picked them out as a design he liked, and they really aren't what I would have been super interested in, but I tried them on, and I love them. They look awesome on. They are called Reverie, and the back is completely open. Wore these in the red with a white lace merry widow piece. It was very well received. ;) Posting photos of front and side view.
B00XZSGTW2|2|Extremely thin. I felt like u could see every freckle on my boobs through the suit. It's cute but make sure u buy padding
B009FQDWDM|3|I bought these as a gift for my nieces and they broke within hours of use.  They are very pretty with the rainbow colors and glitter and my nieces just loved them.  The disappointment after the break just broke my heart.
B00G9TS7XI|5|Good
B008G33AK0|5|the wool is quite warm in the winter (i have little hair) and comes pretty close in sizing. fit and finish are perfect.
B00A9RDQT6|5|I love this. The material is very soft and comfy. fits perfect and washes well. I will be buying a couple more.
B004NBYAX0|1|IF you wash these in the washer, you might as well throw them away.  I am too busy to handwash this stuff and always through my bras in the washer.  The cup gets all lumpy and you can't wear these with anything but a oversized sweater.  Avoid
B00HOWFXZE|4|I bought a different style LAI jeans in the same size and they were a little looser. These are snug. And quite a bit longer than the other pair in the same size.
B00FZ1MUOI|3|It for alittle smaller than I expected and I'm only 9 weeks.
B00HFQFVOW|5|This is it. I was tired of the skimpy look and wanted fuller coverage. This provides that as well as comfort.
B008TSS19M|5|Love it!
B002WJJ8L4|3|Their sizes run small
B00ENC9SW2|5|I love these leggings !! I ordered the small and I'm 5'3 120lb they weren't too tight or loose slightly long the way I like them. They aren't sheer either perfect for anytime!!! Came wayyyyyy before estimated date. Can't wait to wear them!!!
B00R0UN7VM|5|I bought a 14 and a 12. Returned the 12.  At the time, I was between sizes.  I am now 10 lbs lighter, but the 14 still fits nicely, so maybe Donna Morgan runs a little small, or maybe the dress is so well cut it hangs well even slightly large.  Comfortable, perfect for office, lots of compliments.
B00E5SBFAM|5|love it I am very glade I send for it would send for it again if I need a new one
B00DR8FHNM|3|For it being in my size, medium,  I actually had to give the dress to my granddaughter who wears a size two. because it was way too small. The design and colors are pretty. The material very light and comfortable, but it runs about three sizes too small.
B00FJQZF1E|3|Comfortable and fits well.  Only negative is that it wrinkles easily.
B00CAZ3XQQ|5|Again this company hit it outta the park. Perfect fit, and slimming effect. I love it!
B00BJOGUQE|5|The large is very large.  Will order medium next time.  Other than that, very nice pajamas.
B00C392CHK|5|Good fit. Great support in the right areas.
B00JQ1P7QQ|3|These run small had to return and order a larger size.  Otherwise nice shirt.
B0087Y68AW|5|The package arrived within two days. This product along with the name truly speak for themselves. This is the second of these jackets I`ve owned. (the first was misplaced on job site, and I`m sure is still in great shape, travelling the world as we speak.) The fit is perfect. I have abnoramlly long arms, and normally would need a medium for arm length even though the rest of me is an xsmall, but this xsmall was not only on sale, but also fits as if they had monkey armed ladies like me in mind. Bully for you carhartt. kicking ass as always.
B001CVE75K|4|I quite loved this costume. I am about a size 16, and this one fits great! I use a camisole and added some leg warmers and glovleletts to really complete this cure little monster costume :). Loved it.
B00DW4NC06|4|fits loose like its supposed to it loooks nice
B004RZKW2A|3|well i did order a X-Large but got a Large instead of a X-Large but it still fit some what
B00IGLR6F2|4|12 yr old daughter likes the coverage of these hipsters. She's almost 5' tall and 97 pounds, measures 30&#34; around fullest part of her hips. Athletic build with muscular legs and no waist.  The mediums are probably a touch snug in the middle, though she hasn't said so. I worry about the durability of the waistband for that reason. Case in point: We've had some of these for 6 months that I bought elsewhere and I just pitched a pair where the seam on one side of the waistband was coming apart.
B00E58GUAC|3|Does not look like the picture. Nice though.
B008YSTZOC|5|I love this jacket. The jeans and top were nice but the jacket is adorable. One of my favorite things.
B00N6ELQL4|5|PERFECT
B007TOMSAK|5|Yes, this patch is awesome! I love it!
B005GJCTB8|2|These pajamas are very cute, but they definitely run small!  The size 8 was skin tight on my seven year old.
B00K4ZYXJA|4|Somewhat small but still looks very cute on my daughter.  Luckily she's a skinny little thing so she'll still get some wear out of it.
B002LSI30I|4|I love the fabric its made Frm smooth on your skin. They were a little tight at the waist. I do a lot of bending at my job so that wouldn't work. Other then that happy.
B009MOXXEU|2|This could have been a really nice tie had it been big enough for a man. It's made for boys.
B00IVBYGWS|5|I bought a medium, which fit, but I wanted a tunic top. Exchanged the M for a LG which is perfect.Colors are as pictured and are beautiful.Fabric is very nice. Very dark navy with cream/lt.beige. Love this top
B002GYDWJO|5|I LOVED this costume!!! Bought it for Halloween in Vegas and it looked awesome!! The materials look high quality even though it was not expensive at all!! I did buy a petty coat skirt to make it more fluffy and give the skirt some length...skirt is pretty short!! I am 5'3 with a 28&#34; waist and the costume was pretty tight. It was comfortable but if i gain ANY weight this size won't close on me. Overall Great buy!!
B004CO9UOM|5|This underwear doesn't ride up and fits perfectly,no binding.  Would recommend.
B00HQ39CE4|5|I love angels and these are great necklaces!
B00H1ZO8DW|5|It was a gift for my mom and she wears it all the time.
B00FDMURWQ|3|it was cute and fit right BUT the buttons fell off first time i wore both of the ones i purchased. however i just pulled them out and can wear it without the buttons
B00NUHNDYU|5|Nice socks. Well made. Haven't washed them yet. Will update when I do wash them.
B00FEJ6VMI|5|second pair I have bought for bar class! super cute with little grippers in all the right places...balls of feet, toes, and heels. need more colors and I will buy more!
B007Y7QHUY|5|This shirt is good quality, ii fits well.  I'm very satisfied.  I don't have any more to say about this product.
B00M22EF78|5|I purchased this as a gift for someone and their response was that they love it!
B0006M6IQ2|5|I ordered the green one, which is quite a bit brighter than in the picture. I agree that it runs a bit large. I usually wear a small, and the extra small fits me perfectly. It's a great color, great cut, very soft and warm.
B000M9N042|4|Very thin material,but they are real cotton.<br />More like a heavy T shirt material then a sweat pant material .
B008NBH0F6|4|It dose fit small because it's pre-shrunk, so just go one size up. I like the fit, very nice top.
B00MNA0YLU|5|AMAZING!!!! Looks just like Olaf! We had a him at a church function and the children LOVED it!!
B00JTRSFY8|4|Love the outfit super cute I would recommend more buttons there's large gaps between buttons and I have to take to a seamstress now to get buttons added for his photos to be taken for his birthday cake smash photo shoot
B004UUJMMS|5|Bought this for my husband who's 6'3&#34;, 220 lbs in a size XL. It fits comfortably and he can probably still fit a long sleeved t-shirt under it if he needs to. Nice costume.
B0072FNF1C|5|Love it.
B00DWB8ZMY|5|Awesome leggings! Love them! I thought they would be VERY thin, but they are a good thickness. Sized pretty accurate.
B00QVTNGQE|1|Waistband too small. Crotch is halfway down leg, so I'd have to tuck the waistband in the bottom of my bra to wear it. Product was not cotton.
B00SVFSP3U|5|Excellent quality and service.
B00BBTX9DO|3|I purchased this in a size 18 months for my 13 month old grandbaby and it was too small.  I would recommend if purchasing, to get two sizes bigger.
B00JQ9EGT2|4|I loved the bikini it fits good but the bottom part is a little too small
B00GCD66A2|1|My Grandson will not wear these, he put them on and they are &#34;itchy&#34;.  The material is just not comfortable!
B00BJOR658|3|The product is nice for the price I bought it for my fiance and gave it an inspection on arival. The stitching is poor and the cuffs are already separating
B00UI6KCFY|5|Feels really good!  Fits good as well.
B00OKA2RDY|4|I thought this was going to be bad quality but it actually wasnt. It fit well and the fabric is comfortable.  I expected that I was going to get a black color but it was darkish gray. So thats why I put 4 stars. Otherwise its super,cute and i cant wait to wear it
B000AO77SE|5|Darling costume
B00M22GE72|5|Gets a lot of looks.
B00K7HSOZ4|4|These are nice. They are stretchy so they tend to loosen up in the waist. You may want a size smaller.
B002HJQTUW|4|This is a great product. It shipped and arrived timely and my granddaugter just loves it. Although, it says it's a personalized item and I was never asked for a name to put on it or received one.  That I thought sucked.
B00INOACY4|1|this jacket arrived and does not fit well.  it seems to have been unevenly sewn and is not good quality.
B0067I4BA4|5|Gave these to my Boys for Christmas and they both love em.  Never thought I'd see a 17 & 22 yr old guy like a Robe so much.  It is Soft, comfy and thick just what I had hoped for.  Highly recommend for the price.  Tried to buy a Ritz/Carlton robe but it was double the price and I can live without the monogram.
B0031U0Q9G|4|Based on the reviews that it ran small I went with a slightly larger size then I initially thought, and I was wrong.  In my opinion this runs  very true to its size and I am going to order another one in a smaller size.  I'm not going to return the other one as it currently works for hunting when I have extra clothing on.<br /><br />Overall a great belt thus far.
B003IG3XCK|5|They are not cheap play gear.  They have a good feel to the material.  They are thick and wash up nicely.
B00E4YMBAK|4|I got the 3-5 year old size for my tall 2 year old who wears a size 7-8 toddler shoe. These sock fit her great and look really cute. The quality is good .
B00062NQ2Q|5|This is perfect for my husband-that difficult to find size and in a fleece that is soft, durable and perfect for three seasons! Thank you !
B00PVRYUEO|3|Good quality leather, but this are Mumbae, India & most likely fitted on skinny people who eat to much curry & have no muscle at all, jacket was somewhat small, so if your buying a jacket don't go buy the skinoutfit size chart forien sizes run smaller then American.
B008MYFUF6|4|I really like the look of this jacket when I received it.  The only thing is that it's not as thick as I thought.  Other than that it's very nice.
B00NFBY5RA|1|I'm not sure if I got the right pants or not.  They do not look like the picture at all.  I'm still comparing numbers to make sure they sent the right ones.  They might be nice enough pants...once I get over the shock of how different they are from the pictures
B00KHB0ZSO|5|Nice quality and looks great! bright colors, normal sizes. Ships quickly))
B0041NYGMU|5|Great vendor supplied as promised on time and exactly as described
B00RO1WEA2|5|Very comfortable to wear and look great.
B0007YXUDI|4|Love this bra and style.  I have been wearing this bra for years and fortunately playtex still carries it.  Very comfortable though the straps do seem to cut through a bit.  Would love to see Playtex change the design for the straps.
B0056ZAR0C|5|I have worn 180's for many years, this is to replace  a lost pair. They are warm, light weight and keep the wind out of my eaars.
B001KAO1T0|5|When I was nursing my infant, I had a hard time wearing just about any shirt and getting smooth fit without bumps.  These inserts worked great under thin but comfortable nursing bras.  I didn't have any trouble with them staying in place.  I usually wear a C cup, but I got a D size and they were perfect.  Product does exactly what it is designed for.  I think it looked better than many of the foam padded bras I have.  Definitely covered things up smoothly without adding much bulk.
B001OAMTQI|5|I wear size 14 boots and these socks fit nicely and comfortably. The elastic doesn't cut into my legs or slide around like I've had some socks do.
B00OHSFX80|5|Lightweight well made spring or early fall coat with interior lining.  I wear a 14 and would have ordered a 16, knowing from experience that less costly item run small I ordered the 18 out of caution.  Fits perfect with room for a heavier sweater.  Collar stands up nicely to keep out wind and rain and coat folds surprisingly small to take along for travel.  Happy with this purchase.
B00J9C42O0|5|Beautiful!  I absolutely love this dress!  Looks awesome with a belt as well as loose.
B005ON36OK|5|I love these pants!!! I am an african american female with a big butt and small waist and they hug my curves just right with no extra space around my waist. People with the same condition appreciate those things because not all jeans fit us and i was able to get a size smaller than i usually get.<br /><br />The only thing i didnt like that didnt really bother me was the extra piece of string hanging from the bottom of the pants after they have been washed.<br /><br />I recommend these jeans to all women with curves and a small waist.
B0019KFLFO|5|Fit is good and it has ample pockets.  Good quality construction and the denim makes for a comfortable, light casual jacket..  Would recommend.
B00KFDTIQE|5|very good
B010AE5D4I|1|Link did not work
B00K8Q1ANC|5|Good design, wear it warm.
B008J1NXME|5|Cute and fit perfect
B00UXQ2W48|4|Nice fit, haven't worn it in the pool yet because I love the Splash Tankini top so well
B004UO6JDY|5|Everyone I come in contact with like this shirt and all other angry birds tee's. There  are a  lease 5 different shirts. After looking in amazon.com, I found at 3 more shirts, but 2 of them are not avaib. I go to A- Anger Mgt  clinic soooooo this shirt is a happy to  have shirt! ! ! !
B000GIQVLS|5|Worked great for a running costume, but as a guy I had to cut the crotch to allow my guy parts to move around while running. Rocky Horror Ragnar Show was a huge success!
B00EF5QRGM|5|This bikini set is so adorbale. Plenty of compliments on it. The size that you order is the size you get.
B008AK7AVY|5|excelente chaqueta, se ve muy original y es de muy buena calidad. es muy c&oacute;moda y llega en el tiempo que establece la tienda
B00K0069C8|4|A very beautiful vest. Only that it fits a little bit close.
B00BNBB5OA|5|Best bra I ever owned, I ordered two more black, and a white one😁😁😁😁😁😁
B001TT4J3K|4|This shirt is perfect, for me a 2x and cant wait to be a 3rd time tandem jumper!  The shirt is a little large for me, but it will be a perfect shirt to lounge around in :)
B004XH5Z74|4|Comfortable, fits really well.  Every bit as good as my North Face soft shell jacket, but the Columbia was nearly 50% less expensive.
B00K77XLUM|5|Good fit just what I wanted.
B00I86GDLS|5|very nice...  wife loves it
B0083QLQO2|5|I've had these before and would buy them again.  Good quality and a perfect size.
B0070TQBMA|5|THESE SLACKS ARE THE BEST. THEY ALWAYS FIT RIGHT AND ARE EASY TO MAINTAIN. I BUY THEM WHENEVER I NEED MORE.
B00V8JWYY2|5|I ordered this shirt for my son's 21st birthday.  He is picky about his clothes and he really liked the &#34;feel&#34; of this t-shirt.  I ordered a large because the product was listed as shorter and more of a youth cut, my son usually wears a M.  The shirt fit very nice.
B00MGW6RFM|1|Goo zmall
B00FFEJ8SG|5|It's great! My father loves it!
B00MVEG7K0|4|These leggings  I bought for my daughter.  She is small and these still don't go up her thigh.  They are really thick and warm though and look really great.  The color is a bit darker than the picture and they are made well.  Over all we have been satisfied with them.  I am giving them 4 stars because of the fact that the picture shows you can pull them to your thigh and my daughter is small still cant.  Other than that she loves them.
B005DSI1B4|4|Quality cotton romper. Fit as expected.
B0038QW5LU|1|I bought this shirt because a friend of mine is having a camouflage party theme.  After reading the reviews I ordered the next size up. It is so tight and has no give in the material.
B00S2WJ7IO|5|Really nice 100% good.
B0012N458M|3|The bra came in a plain package without any indication of the brand or style.  There was no labels on the bra either.  I consider that rather strange since most companies want you to know that the product is theirs.  It did not fit correctly, so I sent it back anyway.
B004O86JWM|3|These were large, very large. I understand the concept of leg warmers and I have rather large feet and the kept falling down and not staying on my larger than average calves. Skinny chicks could wear these as a dress!
B00TZM8W36|4|Soft and Very NICE! Love it!
B00UAEVTWY|1|sizes run small plus very small pouch
B00S4KZZ26|5|Wish it was longer and hit the floor like in the picture but other than that I love it. It is super sexy!
B003WJZDQW|5|I Thank God For My Prayer Shawl! I Use It Every Morning As I Kneel In Prayer!
B00IJCXZUS|3|Considering that Aloha shirts are traditionally full cut, I was surprised to find this one on the snug size (and may even have to exchange it); otherwise I was pleased with the color, intensity of the pattern and the material.
B004RBXBRC|3|I ordered 1 Size larger and it still is too small..  There is not enough room for your goods. would not buy another.
B004RJRAVW|4|Very plush. I like it.
B008829C1A|5|My fiance likes bracelets & watches & he now wears this one everyday. It has a buckle type of latch on the back. It is a nice soft leather band. Very attractive. Looks great on him.
B00E1YR1DA|1|They don't fit i want to return them, they are too short
B005VMN8JW|4|Bought the item for a friend. Awesome stuff. Fit like a glove, he said. Nice fabric too. Delivery was on time with no issues. Shredder kicks ass! :D
B007BLNK6C|4|ok
B00NAJF0VC|4|Quick shipping, good product...
B00ICT29R8|4|My daughter loves these socks!
B00E5GY41Q|5|I bought this for my boyfriend, fits perfectly.
B004M71RQ8|2|Nice on small size and design but durability is poor.  Not a good buy
B00HZRNNAU|2|Too small for a size 5/6 kids. More like a 4/5.
B001H0F60G|2|2011-09-11
B00MOTW26K|5|went great with a red dress I got that was for summer and a little to big at the top so the scarf was just the right touch. A lot of compliments
B00HYN8R56|5|Love this shirt fits great!
B009YSESAC|1|I want to send it back but have been back and forth with company in China.  Dealing with someone in china where coat came from.  I have to send it back to China at my cost and she said they would refund me...I don't know.  They offered a $10.00 refund but I don't think so.  So I am stuck with coat...it came in a plastic bag and I threw it away so I don't have original bag...waiting to hear what I can do... a real pain to return...so beware of this.  The buttons are plastic...cheap and ugly!!
B00M4K29XU|5|Got here on time & looks very real! Just make sure to get a size bigger im usually  m/l I got an l and fit perfect!
B00NERGNH0|5|Great colors. Love it
B008LMFP4K|1|sopost to be very heavy weight its not its more like a wind breaker<br />picture shows waist lenth it hung to my nee<br />so pissed i threw it in the trash so nobody else get it
B00BAEMO3G|1|Item not as described . Bought this for my eight week old as it stated 0-3 months but when it arrived the size clearly states 3 month old and it's huge on her !
B009EX396Q|2|This suit runs two sizes small on top.  I would recommend this for those who have a smaller bust but large hips and rear.  The belt on the bottom makes the suit look cheap.  I had to return.
B00UR2UZM4|5|Great fit. Not your typical one size fits most u find at stores.
B0062B9DDG|4|it is nice to ware under any shirt or sweater when its cold weather.very nice in winter. can wash and they come out great
B00BQ97FIY|1|The dress is absolutely ugly in person. The material is cheap, I felt like I was wearing a curtain. It wasn't form fitting and was too big in certain spots, but fit in some places? I asked my boyfriend what he throughout when he saw me and his reaction was a big \\"no!\\" (Accompanied by a pair of wide eyes). Had to eat the shipping costs and return it.
B00FJIQQ4C|3|I love the cool color and the fabric is nice but after the first washing it shrunk about 2-3 inches in length and the hem is now shorter on the right than the left. I'm not sending it back because it's just a nightie but still...
B00JKAXD0K|5|:)
B000SKNY96|4|I gave these to my son-in-law as a Santa gift - he was delighted.  I can say more when I see how well they wear.
B00553XFN6|5|It did what it was supposed to do. It passed the jumping jack test. Looks pretty durable so far. There are five hooks, which is sort of a pain, but very supportive. It looks pretty ugly on, but that's not what this bra was made for anyway. I wear a 36 G, and I'm pretty sure this was made for people like me. I got fitted by the bra professionals at Nordstrom.
B006M2T2T0|5|Great product , very durable , soft and comfortable ! They are not heavy and they have stretch to fit different sizes . Would recommend to all !
B00FLVDK46|4|These shorts fit very well.  I wish they were just a tad longer.  The belt comes with the shorts and is light red with an orange undertone.
B00Z6A2DXQ|5|This was a slim fit shirt which describes my hubby. I loved it on him.
B00BEY26H6|5|Exquisite underwear.  I'm a huge fan of the brand, though recently I've been somewhat disappointed as their sizing has started to run on the small side.  I'm usually a medium, but I ordered a large and they look and fit perfectly.  They're also really stretchy, so if you order your normal size, it should fit okay, but I imagine they still fit better a size up.<br /><br />Great fabric, sexy design.  What more could you ask for?
B00PQN8AVM|4|even tho the sizes are little too big they are very nice. thank you
B007FQB8HQ|4|I just got this bag and I am not very dissapointed in how it looks. I will be using it for school since it fits my binder, folder and spirals perfectly. The only bad thing is that is smells quite unpleasant. Currently, I am trying to find a solution to that problem. Besides that, I like the  bag thus far. Great style and size for school!
B00CLTQ8QI|5|Great seller, fast delivery, the seller is always connected, low price and good quality. Would recommend this product.
B00XHWK05S|5|WOW the BEST hat
B003NX8D8W|5|These jackets are wonderful!  They wash well, don't pill or shrink, and are warm while still being light weight.  Living in Minnesota having warm clothes that are not bulky is invaluable!
B008POUQGQ|5|It works perfectly and it very beautiful.  I have ordered one before so I knew the quality would be excellent!
B008L274K8|5|Es una gorra muy bonita y practica me gusto mucho y como era para un regalo la persona que lo recibio le encanto
B0000ZE7D6|5|Full coverage and very comfortable.
B00T57OPXC|5|The material on the brim if fire!!! The best snapback I bought so far.
B00ECG6JH6|5|Very cute. My 35 year old is obsessed with unicorns.  Got a matching cup.  Quick delivery. No complaints.
B0078YZI08|2|This was way too big for me. I'm 5'1 and an A cup. It fit baggy, the crotch hung down too low, and the cups were too big. Also, I didn't realize that there were two colors of this. Black is black and red and the black/nude is the one pictured. So I accidentally got the wrong color.
B0000DCA57|5|This is a very high quality item at less than half the price of  similar ostrich wallets.  I was initially hesitant to buy it in part because the dimensions were not shown in the description and because it is often the feel of leather goods that tell a lot about them.  In the end I figured if it was a bust, I'd just return it.  I was very pleased to find the dimensions were standard and the feel solid.  If you want an ostrich wallet, this an excellent choice.
B008BWOOK6|5|Husband bought this for me as a surprise for my birthday & it is super cute & super sexy. Definitely recommend!
B001HQP632|5|The hat feels like its a good quality and it looked good when recieved.
B004U0IRGU|1|Bought 2 sets of these as a Christmas gift and neither one of them worked. It seemed as though there was some faulty wires or something. Kids were soooo disappointed :(
B0051PKCU2|5|I don't really buy bottoms in S, M, XL, etc.. I usually go by numbers.. But after reading the reviews, I decided to go with a large. And I'm kinda glad I did. Like others have pointed out, there isn't much stretch in the waist. Which would make it harder for people with bigger hips to get the skirt on. I'm usually about a 8-9 in jeans. I'm 5'3&#34; and about 130 lbs. The skirt (which rest above my hips, under my rib cage) went alittle past my ankles.<br /><br />I gave it a 5-star because the skirt is absolutely lovely. It came in a really amazing color blue, it's very light weight which will be awesome for my cosplay. And was exactly as described. Oh and not to mention it came exactly one week earlier than expected!
B007R8QABQ|5|Gift for Grandson who hates math.  He loved the note on it. He lives out of state so I haven't seen him in it, but he says it fits him just right and he likes it.  I haven't actually seen that one, but the others I ordered that I did see were good quality and I have had no complaints from him or his mother.
B00L80UE9S|5|This shirt was a surprise gift for my son and he loves it. It looks and fits great.
B00RZ7RYY6|5|it is nice ,and I like it
B00APT7SYW|5|I am now a permanent customer of this bra company!  I am a 36-38DDD it ain't easy finding bras that fit comfortably, keep the girls where they belong and best of all...no boob's boobs...you ladies know what I'm talking about, when the cup spillith over.  Sexy, cute, fits great I'm going to get every color they have !!!!  Thank you, thank you thank you!!!!!
B00AL8I5A8|5|Sweet! :D Perfect gift for my friend!! ^w^
B00LHZGN0S|5|I bought this peacoat in Medium and Small, just because I wasn't sure which one would fit me better. The Medium turned out to be too large on me and I returned it. But otherwise it is a very nice coat and I do recommend it. Its very stylish and elegant.
B00FS5MVIG|4|I ordered it for my daughter. Even though she is 8, i ordered 10 because she is very tall for her age.It fits as expected and is a nice dress expecially for parties where there is not much of free play. Since the material is net , its not fit for rough use which is visible from the photo itself.
B000MXB554|5|Love it
B00LVSFO7Y|4|Ninja Turtles for my 3 year old nephew! Its never too early to get them into Turtle Power. This is a cute little plush robe. Good stuff. Happy with purchase
B000QGTNII|5|I was expecting something cheesier and not as good for the price but was pleasantly surprised.  I was very happy with this hat.  Thank you!<br /><br />The plastic hat was thick enough to be sturdy and not feel cheap.  This hat was used for a prize at a family bowling party we sponsored.  Everyone was excited as we picked the winner and presented them with this nice &#34;bowler&#34; hat!
B002IRJNCY|4|The sideburns don't wait but as I would like them to. Other than that it's expensive funny wig it does the trick
B0006OJ7TU|5|These are so much fun!
B00KQQOGT4|5|This shirt was a big hit with my truck driving friend.  Put a smile on his face.  Thank you.
B00062NHJI|5|Best undershirts I've owned.
B00008IK7I|4|I've looked everywhere for a panty that fits like this one. It's very comfortable, smooth, and feels good on my skin. Something great to wear at home with nothing else. I'll most likely get more of these. Probably my favorite panty right now.
B000MXB1OE|5|I had two of these under a different style number for years. I found these and they are identical. If you are looking for a good underwire bra, non-stretch straps with support and shaping, these are for you. They are not a T-shirt bra as there is no lining as there is with a T-shirt bra. I wear these for my running/workout sessions for the support. They were a bit snug when fastened on the innermost hooks, but after washing, line drying (NEVER in a dryer) and a bit of hand-stretching, they are very comfortable.
B004XZFGO8|2|Even though this product arrived on time... I did not like it... I though I am ordering Italian-silk made ties - it is cheep looking China-made tie.... not worth spending money on it.
B00A6811Z4|5|I purchased with the cov-up, shorts and beach pants and I wear all of them!  Great combo of items to wear on vacation so you can get up from the pool/beach and go.
B00KGE4SRQ|4|Fit as expected but seem a bit on the short side. Very comfortable.
B00BHILNY6|4|I keep on the lookout for these.
B009W59OUQ|5|I've worn a few different colors regularly the last two years.  I ordered more because I like them so well I don't want to have to do without when the finally wear out.  They looks good coming out of the dryer.  No ironing necessary!
B00KI9ZSAK|4|The shirt design is nice, however the sequins threads etc. are fragile....loose after a couple wash and wear times.  I never put in the dryer just air dry.  I dont know if mine was just defective or if I was supposed to hand wash in woolite.  (I wash on gentle cycle inside out)....
B0081HTKP0|5|Great stretchy thong, feels as though you are wearing nothing. Good unisex thong for both women and fits male anatomy as well.
B00CPWBE4C|5|Fast service, exactly what I was looking for.
B004UUHVJO|5|Yeah, so the mask is super creepy, but my kid loves the costume. It's lasted longer than most of his costumes, and he has quite a few.
B001PTGAQ8|5|Perfect underwear for any occasion. Very breathable, and form fitting. Not constrictive but holds ur junk in place. They are hands down my favorite. This is my third pair. Shame they cost so much, but you get what you pay for.
B0095FE0E8|3|Just was the way I want it
B0044DE6KE|4|Having worn the two pairs I purchased now a few times, and having washed them, I can confirm what other reviewers have said - while the socks are comfortable new and do the job, they are by no means high quality and I wouldn't expect them to last more than a few (say 5-7) wears. They are just too thin and \\"made in china\\"<br /><br />From an appeal perspective, they look nice and are completely hidden from view when wearing loafers. I did not have any issues with the heal slipping or any blistering.<br /><br />Overall I wish I liked them more considering the cost, but they are \\"ok\\"
B001M0MN16|5|I originally bought these to wear while working out because of the moisture wicking. I loved them so much I know own about 10 boxers and 10 boxer briefs. I wear them everyday and no longer own any other underwear. Great product.
B003IC7W76|4|This was a great costume for Halloween. The only complaint I would have is it's sizing. I normally wear a size 8. I ordered a medium and that stated that it was for a size 8 to 10. There is no way it would fit a size 10. It was very form fitting, but with control top pantyhoses, it looked good. If you are in doubt, order a size up.
B00H8VB7DS|4|Straps don't move, always comfortable.  They are my go to brand.  No more trying on every bra at a store.
B0037ZD4C6|5|I bought this top in size XS (I'm 5'1\\", size 2)--it fits like a glove.  The fabric is a very nice, medium weight, 52% cotton, 45% polyester and 3% spandex.  I ordered black for school, the image on Amazon looks like this is black on black, however, it is black fabric with gray stitching.  I give this a 10 out of 10.  The shipping was excellent.  p.s. If you are considering the Cherokee Mock-Wrap Flexibles, that fabric is thinner, (65% polyester/35% cotton), the cut is fuller and overall quality is not as good.  I would give it a 5 out of 10.
B000JJG9JS|5|I bought this hoodie knowing that it was going to be big on me, it is what I wanted! I'm 5'5&#34; and it comes down almost over my butt, fits with generous room and is super comfortable. I would say it's a midweight hoodie but I am also always cold, it is thick but not uncomfortable and heavy thick.
B00F59HJL4|5|My daughter recieved this as a gift and could hardly contain herself! I bought another one for my niece as a gift cuz we love it so much. Any pony lover will be totally thrilled with this hoodie.
B00AHDUK9G|2|The product does look like the picture. The material is nice and the corset fits the abdomen nicely. But the bust of the corset does not hold tight. The bust has no support. My breasts just set there, it provided no stability to keep the girls n place.
B00415AMXK|5|These socks are very good quality and nice overall. They are pricey, but they are worth it when compared with cheaper alternatives.
B0040ALM8K|5|Looks great, keeps you very warm!  Hoodie is a button on/off.  It does run small so get a size bigger I recommend! Good thing I wont be working in this sucker or I would be very upset! Very comfortable material on the inside as well! Worth your money!
B00PJWBXRI|4|This is cute and comfortable. It's slightly small for size but no big deal. I needed something inexpensive as a set of back up clothes for when my granddaughter is at our house in case she messes up the clothes she is wearing. This fit the bill.
B00TATK62O|1|I believe this product is a counterfeit. The sleeves were WAY too big and the rest WAY too small. Dickies doesn't make ill fitting clothes like this. I had to return it.
B00JQX1UUG|5|Well-made, flattering fit!
B003V4AKXE|3|Although stylish and well-fitted, I was a bit disappointed that it was not as thick and durable as the black one.  I would recommend this belt to anyone that is not too rough on a belt and wants to look good in a great belt.
B00PGXTO1C|4|This outfit is REALLY CUTE. The shirt could use an extra button and I thought the shorts would have the embroidery at the back as well but it is really nice. Good for a Sunday Afternoon out
B00AWUWV2I|2|It was supposed to have been an extra large 42 U.S.  But it fit more like a Large . I personally think it was<br />put the wrong tags. I was waitting for the<br />price to go down and<br />when it finally did I<br />order it. It was to small<br />though .<br />l for me. I would like to order another coat,<br /><br />hopefully I'll get the<br />right size this time. A<br />righteous extra large<br />42 U.S. will do .
B00F59HKUO|5|This hoodie is a wow!  It is well constructed, imaginative and useful for special play as well as everyday wear.
B00EPWSL1Y|2|I LOVED this shirt until I washed it. The material is tight fitting, and fit ok when I first got then after 1 wash it went down about a size and that isn't to bad I ordered larger than needed just incase. However, the picture is cracking and fading after just ONE wash. Very disappointed in the quality of this shirt and how it held up to being washed.
B003B164ZA|5|Excellent! Great fit and great quality.
B00QVWK6Y6|5|Perfect.  Looks great on a Multicam pack.
B00XD861OU|4|Great jacket and very cute. The only design flaw is there are NO pockets on the tummy where normal hoodies have pockets.  There is a tiny hidden pocket in the left arm.
B00LNWAL6C|1|Don't waste your money very cheaply made!
B00JGPNOE4|5|excelent
B007KFZEP4|2|if it fit  I would like it this is cut very small it's not made for anyone who is busty
B003J3H0GM|5|This was the exact perfect color I was looking for. I was also looking for something that was well fitted. Not tight, but just fit perfectly, so there aren't any extra bulges or wrinkles anywhere and this was absolutely perfect for everything I wanted.
B001PUHJB2|3|Just OK. The material used seems to lack support at the pointed tie ends, which show a curl and do not lay flat when worn.
B00FZSCO4C|5|This is also a nice blouse and material that I purchased from this seller.  I received a lot of compliments.  Have not wash yet but I would recommend hand wash.
B00C9T1LQM|5|Way too large! Absolutely good otherwise...
B00FOBAIPC|5|On time. Delivered as expected.
B006ZH86DU|5|Very wonderful :)
B0096A4L64|5|Exactly as states, durable and comfortable! Wore these for a charity Olympic event and they were a huge hit!
B004L9M5HC|4|Have purchased in the past with good results.  They shrink just a little but have no issues with the sizing
B00K7YLBR0|5|Well made and brightly colored.
B008J7BHVM|5|Very comfortable and didn't slide down.<br />I received a lot of complements.  So cute!
B00M0GTICI|5|Amazing
B004B8HV3Q|5|Exactly what I was looking for.
B00H2WHR0K|4|Definitely keeps things in the right place and accessible.
B005I33OZ2|1|Terrible gloves.  The first time that I wore these my fingers were extremely cold.  They are not waterproof, the inner liner was somehow always damp and would never dry out.
B008Z4NFA0|2|There's no nice way to put this... This hat is really ugly. What the pictures don't show is that the brim of the hat is an gross dirty white color underneath. It looks pretty silly. It fits poorly too. It's puffy on the sides in the rear, but fits slimmer in the front. I wouldn't recommend this hat. Unless you like looking like a golfer.
B000Y15P46|5|I'm 5'3 & 103lbs., size small fits me well, its a little bit stretchable which I like. Perfect for work.
B0096A1N1A|5|I got this shirt for my boyfriend. He loves it. It reminds him of more expensive brands and it was only $$20
B004BIWO4W|5|The shirt definitely gives you a feeling of empowerment.  I feel like I'm ready to go-to-blows with Mothra, Ghidorah, or Rodan (not to be confused with the French sculptor, Auguste Rodin 1840-1917).
B0045WEMK8|1|I bought a size 12 thinking it wldd bé perfect but it turned out too small,looks like a size 8/10.
B00EJCR0V2|2|I did not like the material the gloves are made from and even though they are size small, they are too large.<br />If they are actually leather, it is a very poor quality leather.<br />I want to return them as soon as possible.  Unfortunately, a packing list with return info was not included in<br />the pkg.
B00AFDC22Q|5|This is our favorite brand for children. The cotton is so thick and soft and the outfits hold up wash after wash. The hats that come with these outfits are also a great fit and cute! I find this brand runs true to size and length.
B00BN0YXNG|5|WALLET WAS JUST WHAT I EXPECTED!! I LOVE IT AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS<br />THE WALLET IS NOT CHEAP MADE AND GOOD QUALITY..
B00JFYUYQW|5|This had so many positive reviews, and with it being such an awesome price I decided to give it a try.  I will never regret that.  At all.  I feel soooo attractive and sexy in this thing.  It's also my husband's favorite piece of lingerie that I have.  His face when he saw me...  :)  haha  I think he likes it.  Great product for a great price.  Highly recommendable.
B00CBR7VES|5|excellent my granddaughter looks so cute in this outfit.
B007UMNT0E|5|The color of this jacket is exactly as pictured and the fit is what you would expect. I'm 5'10 and average/slim build nad the medium was just fine! Long enough lengthwise and sleeves.
B00JMC5IKE|2|For Me, I didn't find this to be that practical. You still need to wear a long sleeve workout shirt with this jacket. There are heated pads on the chest, and back and collar. U could only feel the heat precisely where the pads were located. Everywhere else, the cold just came through.  I couldn't really tell that the collar was heated. This overall, was disappointing to me.
B00DT4R4KS|5|These overalls are made very well of good material.
B00QMF3OQO|5|Comfortable and stretchy! Feels like nothing in the water and does not pinch, hold or slow you down while popping up to surf.
B00CLVEK2K|4|Okay, so this sweater definitely gets &#34;double takes&#34; and laughs. Many people do not see the joke the first time they look at it. It looks like almost any other bright Red and White Christmas sweater with Reindeer on it. After a second look, they all laugh and comment.<br /><br />The sizing is a bit too small. I ordered a 2XL. It really was closer to an XL. But, I squeeze into it anyway because it is getting such good laughs!
B005GQ2PQU|5|I was please with the uniform shirts.  Very good quality for the price.
B004PBQWJS|5|this bikini looks great on. maybe expensive but it is a quality item. the pucker back is gorgeous. I would recommend it highly
B002E02EKI|5|I ordered this as a gift for my boyfriend and it looked just like the shirts in the episode.  A great gift for an Office fan:)
B004ALZVWC|2|I received my coat on time. I was very disappointed because the plastic on the coat is paper thin and looks like it could rip easily. The colors were pretty but the quality of this coat is   poor.
B003IBT702|5|Everyone gave me tons of complements for the money it was worth it I could wear it again or share with a friend
B006ZUU82Y|5|brilliant colors and great feel. i can not complain about anything i've gotten from ever pretty. they run long, but if your tall like myself it's not a problem but a blessing.
B00O0KWNLK|1|Not useful for anything<br />Don't buy
B00BOEADV2|5|This are pretty phenomenal. They fit as expected, I was originally worried the length would be too small; perfect fit though. Lots of compliments on the rear end. I wear compression underwear underneath them. People will see the outline of your manhood if you do not. I ordered this color and the blue, both great and equal in fitting. I am 5'8&#34;, 160 lbs, and a 31&#34; waist. I wear them to Yoga and to run in. They are awesome. Pricey, but awesome.<br /><br />If you go to the main website, there is sometimes a code for a discount. I did not know this until already made my purchase.
B003EHWMAC|5|My daughter just loves them! Super cute, and fit nicely not to thick so hands dont get to hot or sweaty
B0072ZIK80|5|Good one
B0094MEHK4|5|Fit great, good quality, and looks great as well. Great purchase
B00F2YSAAG|4|other than being a bit to small i love these socks! came in earlier than expected and came in an actual huf packaging
B0094G6TME|4|The minute I saw this dress I knew I had to have it. I wasn't all that pleased that I would have to wait so long for it, but I figured it was worth it. This is a beautiful dress, especially for the price. My only problems were: a) it is much, MUCH shorter than it appears in the picture (if you're got any curves whatsoever, order a size up, unless you want this dress to be a shirt), and b) the zipper in the back seems very fragile and like it will not hold up over time. Otherwise, the dress is gorgeous, looks very nice on the lace isn't scratchy in the least. Even with the long wait, the dress arrived a week before its estimated arrival date, so no real complaints there! I just had to take a star off for the length (or lack thereof) and the zipper.
B000632S9M|4|These earmuffs are toasty warm, and also comfortably lightweight, due to the use of thinsulate material.  They are a little difficult to unfold and adjust to size, since they snap back to their folded configuration, but one you get them on, they are comfy and warm. I am going to order another in grey.
B0012T0LCA|5|This caftan was worth every penny.  It was a gift for my mother and she feels wonderful wearing it.  It fits well and looks elegant.  It is nicely tailored.  We recommend it!
B00546ER40|5|I really like these socks. I bought the 12 pair in white and they fit and they stay on. I have bought many different brands of low sport socks and these are the first I have found that truly fit. There is no sliding off no matter what kind of shoes I am wearing. They may not be the longest lasting socks I have had, but they are cheap enough to just order more.
B00A5BDO70|3|Will I think that is not that good and not that bad for its price. However, the neck area is too tight I would prefer it if it was wider. the material of the shirt is fine meaning not that good and not that bad
B00ISP8HLI|5|Good fit and stylish.  It was a hit among my wife's &#34;Good Wife&#34; fan buddies.
B00GIIISYS|3|I agree with a previous review that the cotton fabric quality is fair at best. Also, I received a different pattern than demonstrated in the image, similar to another reviewer.
B00GBTGHWE|5|simple and classy ,I love it and the price is good ,gabby skye have nice dresses and nice quality ,this is my 2 dress.
B00E3BGD5S|5|Great color and weight, very soft inside. Even looks great turned around! Bought for an oversized, comfy sweatshirt to wear with leggings, and I am not disappointed! Looks good on my man, too.
B00MNNBJKM|5|My grandson loves this shirt and wears it all the time.
B00DYXGNME|5|I was looking for a casual dress for a party, and this one is just right.<br /><br />I'm 5'4&#34; and the length is mid-calf on me. The fit is perfect, and unlike some dresses that are designed for taller people, the neckline is right without weird folds or falls off the shoulders.<br /><br />It is a natural-ish fiber (rayon), and I wouldn't count on colorfastness. I handwash it in cool water and dry on cool temps. But I also steam out wrinkles and haven't have an issue with shrinkage by steaming.<br /><br />The embroidery is gorgeous, and ties in the back make it fit well. The princess style waist line is a lot subtler in darker colors, and it has a fairly full skirt.<br />It's a gorgeous casual dress, and my husband really loves how it looks on me. I plan to get a few more in other colors.
B00GNUHSAQ|5|I'm 5'10&#34; and have a bust of 32e. I normally wear a medium in woman's, since this was juniors I ordered a large. It fits great, a little snug in the bust, but not so tight that it looks bad. I love this, I didn't realize that Volcom was written in the flamingos leg when I bought this, but it isn't so noticeable. All in all I adore this.
B00GRNJQGI|5|The fabric is soft and stands up well to dry cleaning. We have not seen any seams give way. My husband was just fitted at another store that sells these pants and the size is true to the fitting we had with an executive break at the foot.
B001PUFHFM|5|It is perfect, looks nice, and easy to use.  It was bought for a Halloween costume and was very nice
B0076R6LNA|3|I initially bought a large, as my other Columbia fleece jacket is a large and fits perfectly.  The large of this style would barely zip across my chest (44R).<br /><br />I exchanged for an XL, which looks like it would fit a size 50.  It works though and the price was right.
B0088B2S9O|4|Great shirt! My daughter wore it to a Hawaiian Dan e at school and it was great. Live the color and style!
B0029IQIRU|5|Adorable
B00MVAPFJ8|4|Some issues with zipper
B00N26R944|5|This was an awesome buy. Well made and beautiful colors. Fit perfectly and it was a great birthday gift. Would definitely recommend this product.
B00HX9VL40|4|They fit him well and he's 6'3&#34; and prefers the shorts to come just below his knees. He is happy with the fit and look of these shorts.
B00RMMR60G|4|Are as expected other than are a little on the large size. I ordered a medium but seem like a large
B007KFZGWA|3|It's okay
B002RW4C3U|5|Very comfortable
B00EA1BV5I|5|the red color my favorite one
B00ULZAEUA|5|These are great!! Especially for under dresses.
B00G6S33NG|4|It was what I expected.
B00DRGJTO2|5|Awesome
B00X79VFEG|1|SOOOO small! The large would fit a tiny 8 year old. Terrible service, took months for shipment and then could not return, going to goodwill for some small child that needs a grown up bikini. Worthless.
B00B795B70|5|My granddaughter had this on her birthday wish list.  She loves it and the fit was perfect.
B002ZGIUCW|2|if you like animal print and want to purchase this scarf, i would try a seller you can return easily.<br />it depends on who wear them, it did not look good on me, i did not like them on me but i gave it to my friend and she liked it.<br />i did not contact this seller, so i do not know if they are nice seller or not.
B00IZ8K0J0|4|I bought it for my sister's wedding, this is what she chose for the groomsmen.  Husband says its a little itchy, but after a dry clean he was fine.  He loves the material and informed that the material was cool, just itchy.
B00YI0Z3FK|5|This is a great shirt for Batman fans. I bought this shirt for my husband. This is a real cool shirt to wear. The fit is perfect & it even came a day early. Excellent!
B004NEA3WO|5|I'm a cabinetmaker, this is the best apron I have found for my purposes.
B007YXN9I6|5|My son loves this shirt. This was probably the best gift I have bought him over the years, he wears this more than most other shirts.
B00DXYYUTW|5|would order another from this seller. Was as expected.
B00C3NFAMA|2|It was the right size but was very misshapen... I haven't worn it.  I didn't return it because the cost of shipping wouldn't have been worth it...
B0053127PW|5|love it
B00CHGONEY|5|bueno
B008S16O12|4|It's nice, it's a big white T.... the neckline is cute... it runs very big though!
B00QTLT89S|5|Best sports bra I've ever owned! Can't believe I've been wearing unsupportive and unattractive target brands all these years! I'm a 34D and the Medium fit perfectly. It doesn't smush down your chest making it look flat and saggy -- Your chest actually looks nice in this bra AND it feels secure and supportive. I just threw out my other sports bras and will be investing in other colors of these :)
B009LEFPO2|5|Do you want to look like a million bucks and 20 pounds lighter?  Then this is THE top for you. Do not under estimate the power of nice clothing. This top fits beautifully, has elegant, flowy lines and looks like you bought it at an upscale clothing store. I purchased it to wear for my daughter's orchestral performance, and it made me feel like the most beautiful, refined and classy creature there. I absolutely love it. Dress it up with a skirt or a tad more casual with jeans. Just buy it, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Also, I sized up one size and it does fine for me. It is stretchy, so I could have stuck with my normal size.
B00K5NDXJM|5|Great outfit! It is made and fits very well!
B0012ZQ5Y2|5|Really soft, super warm- have had alot of compliments. It is so warm that I was out shoveling snow in -3 degree weather with no jacket and still very comfortable.
B00F2YET5G|4|Not bad at all. Good quality material and adequate detail on the print. My only complaint is that the fabric is so dark that it doesn't let enough light through to the shower when it's closed, but that's just the nature of dark fabric rather than a flaw in the product. Something to keep in mind when buying.
B00NIN0JJS|4|Some of the other reviews said that the sleeves were a little short, and that is definitely true. But overall, it is a nice warm sweater.
B0083U4R6C|5|Loved this item great product with great price. Fast delivery would purchase from this seller again.
B000BQW9GQ|2|The inside rim is hard plastic and is uncomfortable to wear.  It looks good though.
B00I3S7XYM|5|best brixton hat
B00HSHGPL6|4|It was a bit too large for my size, but it cute and warm.
B003O68AHC|5|This is perfect for a mad hatter!  I'm excited to wear it.  Exactly what I was looking for to finish my costume.
B00I54X4LA|1|I'm a 36B and I could barely force the size 36 down past my nipples, and under the arms was so tight I can't imagine wearing it to sit around let alone work out in. Also didn't make me any flatter than my normal sports bra, which is much more comfortable and easier to put on. Had another binder from this company that was rubbish too, but I got it years ago and I figured they must've improved since people still seem to wear their stuff. Apparently first impressions hold true in this case, because even the cheapo Chinese cosplay binders are better than this, and you can have one of those for what Underworks charges just for shipping both ways. Also, it arrived with a smear of dirt on it right in the middle of where your boobs are supposed to go. Dunno if someone else hated it too and sent it back after trying it on while wearing eyeliner or what, but that's just nasty regardless of how it fits.<br /><br />If you want a comfortable binder just pony up the extra $10 and get the pullover short binder from Love Boat. I was hoping this one would be a little bit cooler to wear since it's still really hot where I live, but now I just hope they send me a refund quickly so I can get something that actually works.
B008YOMB7O|5|This is a great hat for anyone who has a Firefly connection.
B00A0QUPSG|3|Great shirt love this color .
B006C9WXOE|5|Fett is one of my favorite characters from STAR WARS, so this one is awesome! This came looking exactly like the box and it is one of my favorite belt buckles. If you are a STAR WARS fan and want an excellent buckle, this is perfect! The only downside to this is that I have a bit of a belly and the antennae in the upper left of the picture does dig in a little if I bend at the waist too much, but it is of minimal concern. Enjoy and may the force be with you!!
B001HBBFIC|3|This thing is cheap plastic, works for a costume but not a toy.
B00574M4SK|5|The best no-show socks I ever owned. It's very comfortable to use and fits my feet. It doesn't slip like the ones I used to own even though this one feels very smooth on the skin.
B00VHCKLYA|5|Fits perfectly. I did order the white and the black. Hides all the imperfections if you know what i mean.
B00FEOR7IU|3|Sox are OK, but too large. There is only one size available, product description says  &#34;fits mens 8 to 12.&#34;  I'm a 9-1/2 and they're sloppy and loose on my foot.  They don't fit close to the foot like other high-end wool socks.
B00HEA4R8K|3|The Quality was not as expected. There is a run in the lining material and one side of the support pieces was not sewed in and I had to take plastic piece out.
B00QGLQ9GG|5|Beautiful dress, exactly like the photo good material the size is perfect
B00BCUP9SK|4|Great , love it
B000BIGSFM|1|I got this cincher for my holiday party dress, but it was awful. My boyfriend didn't like it at all. It cinched me in, but it was too long for my torso and added an extra &#34;curve&#34; where it ended. I didn't look like a better version of myself at all. I ended up not wearing it under the dress and just returned it.<br /><br />I also ordered the Fleece cincher based on reviews some people liked this one better and others that one. Similar issue there. I returned them both.
B003R9FRRC|3|Out of the package I can see snags in the material already.  But, they look okay.  Would splurge in the future for the real deal.  I do not expect brand new stockings to have defects in the material.  But, I need this for a party, so i do not have time to return.
B00HS60LF8|5|Astonishingly gorgeous. Precisionist movement emulates old sweep of the tuning fork.  So beautiful I bought two.  Easily one of my all time favorite watches.  Is a little on the large side,  but gets tons of compliments.  Love, love, love it.
B00F2T9NKC|5|This is a beautiful pajama. I got is as a gift for my mom and haven't given it to her yet. I give her pajamas almost every year and they are always hard to wrap, but this pair came in a fancy box that makes it easy and pretty! I know she's going to love it. I also really like the pattern and color choices. The seller was very helpful.
B006MIZKB8|5|Awesome
B00HFP8IE8|5|The jeans are well worth the cost! They were a little large. The quality of these jeans are excellent.
B003G8V8DQ|4|Not the heaviest or most surdy I've seen, but decent.  Looks nice, and much less money than buying directly from Indian.
B0008EKW6U|4|I've worn this bra a great deal since my daughter arrived; it is very comfortable and supportive.  The clasps are easy to undo one handed but not easy to do back up again; the 'receiver' part on the strap moves too easily.  Lastly, I'm 5'3\\", I have the straps at their longest limit and the back fastening is still 'high' on my back, making it difficult to fasten.
B0018MWXSQ|5|I purchased these cuff-links for my personal hero, the heart surgeon who performed minimally invasive aortic valve replacement on my 35 year-old wife's failing valve.  When he opened the box he was overjoyed with these cuff-links.  Conveniently, our surgeon's last name started with the letter \\"S\\".  It was the perfect gift!
B00CFQIK5E|5|I wore this top to my mom's 80th birthday party and received many compliments on how nice it is and how pretty the color is. It's nice and cool and fits perfectly.
B00M5CV98I|4|I'm 5'0&#34; 160 pounds and I ordered an XL.it fits tightly as expected. Feels very comfortable, I can move freely during the day and exercise. I prefer to wear it with a thin tank top underneath because the top edge rubs my skin a bit.
B00ICY1F7I|1|They were way too small so useless to me.
B003V4AL06|5|Been wearing daily for a couple of months now. Holes are strong and don't rip, looks classy enough for my business casual office and seems to be going strong. the lining on the buckle hasn't worn off, and everything seems solid.
B00F8XS8LC|5|Everthing as expected.
B00KDCBN56|5|Let me start with the quality it is a real strong built corset! I have seen corsets like this one for $200 at other places if you want the real deal not just a cheap knock off stop looking and get this one I bought it for my Halloween costume thinking ok $35 its going to be cheaply made but to my suprise it is the best quality corset I have ever owned!
B004HTTAUQ|5|This carhartt work shirt is great . Its very durable, comfortable, but it is a little bigger than my other xl t shirt, but i quickly got used to it
B00I86AJ7M|4|Really nice shirt exactly like the picture the size just ran alill smaller than I thougt but still fit ok
B004ZWHDJK|3|I wear girls socks because my size 5 foot is too small for women's socks.  These are a perfect fit, but the toe seam is very irritating.
B00JBF7JJU|5|Can't beat the price, exactly as pictured.
B0083QLPYI|5|These have been a huge money saver during my pregnancy.  I went up a cup size but was still a 32 for a long time so that was what I bought.  But then the 32 started feel too tight but I really didn't want to cough up more money for bras until I have to start breast feeding.  These are soft and very easy to use.<br /><br />Make sure you measure the distance between the hooks on the bras you want this for so you get the right extenders.  I almost bought the 3/4 inch ones until it occurred to me I had no idea what exactly I needed. The 1/2 inch ones fit my bras from Aerie perfectly.
B00EVLVJJ0|3|I wanted something to walk and sweat in...if I were running or weight lifting, these would not work. If you are doing light exercise they are okay. I wear a size 40 D to 40 DD bra so I purchased according to the size chart. These are loose and would not withstand extreme exercise so beware.
B008PYW7KO|3|I find having two sides for the keys is great, but the keys need to be in the same direction.
B00EPFOK8O|4|Fit perfect, I have not worn it yet so not sure how it will stand up to washing.<br />The colors are vibrant and I am planning to wear it Easter Sunday.<br />I am 5 10\\" and it hits right above the knee.
B004VK8ND6|5|I own two pairs of these jeans, one in dark wash and one in the lighter wash. They are my favorite pants. If you have wide hips and a small waist, these jeans will accentuate both. Whenever I wear these, someone tells me I look really skinny because they flatten out your tummy. People do say they look like &#34;mom jeans&#34; though but whatever, they're hot.
B004Z7PEAA|5|It made it through a summer in the sun from San Diego to Pheonix. I love this hat it keeps the sun off my face and ears and it is comfortable sitting on a boat on the beach or at the waterpark with the kids, the strap comes in handy for surfing wakeboarding or going down the black widow. Nothing shakes this thing! Not even obviously jealous comments about my goofy sun hat!
B00F8KBY3E|1|Ordered a large and i think i popped the stitches getting in and out of it. My top was falling out (im a 36C. And it was miserable and unsexy. Im 5 5, 145lbs so im definitely not fat and this was like tiny asian sized.
B008HNJ8AK|3|The colors are great, the length of the sleeves is fine, but the body is very short for a XXL and the material is very thing.
B00HES3RGA|5|bought for daughter-in-law for Christmas. She loves all things with cats on them. Very happy with scarf.
B008HCJE50|5|I bought two sets of these for the holidays:  one for my husband and one for my dad, and they both loved them!  The top is a nice thick cotton, and the pants are mid-weight and very soft.  They almost have a fleece-like feel to them.<br /><br />I'll update my review to note how these hold up after washing them a few times, but, for now, both of the guys loved them and they made great gifts!
B00E9OVXX6|5|Fits as expected, arrived on time.
B006JGUMG6|4|This is a nice-looking shirt!<br />Great colour, nice fit. It can complete business attire or be worn at more casual occasions.<br />Nice price as well!
B008F3RTX0|2|The product is pretty and look nice, but made by low quality material.<br />The Suture line released after a few time of using.<br /><br />The jacket is fit for Autumn weather and not really keep you warm.<br /><br />I don't recommend to buy this product.<br /><br />Add more money and buy better quality jackets.
B009JW1M5M|3|Fits a lil snug but bf still loves it I recommend ordering a size bigger than what u wear -k-
B00E1MVFKW|4|I like these - they're super tight as they're shaping wear but they're cute. They are a little see through in the bum. So, make sure to wear the right shirt.
B00469T5OS|5|When your top or dress is too low cut for the office, this bra is perfect for covering up without having the bulk of wearing a camisole, But it looks like you're wearing one. Perfection, so much so that I bought it in black too!!
B00274YCGA|4|Great quality belt; however, I saw nothing on the Amazon page at the top that indicates one needs to order at least one size bigger than their jeans/pants size.  I noticed that two other customers who mentioned the same problem.  I wear a 30, but the 30 was much too small - in fact, I measured it and found I needed at 34 for the belt to comfortably meet and hold in the middle.  I have sent the belt back and asked for the larger size.
B001SN7PQK|4|I knew this shirt ran small because of other reviewer's comment and so, I purchased an XXL. It was a gift for a family member and they really liked it.
B00VX79FK0|2|Does not look like in a picture.
B00PTZSCIS|1|Very cheap quality! I was so excited to get this dress and I couldn't have been more disappointed! The top had strange netting all around, it was see through all over and WAY too short. I will be returning this and getting my money back!
B00A6NO57K|5|Quality of hose good and delivery  was within stated time.
B000N5CP0U|2|I just about sent it back because wearing a veterans cap made in china does not sit well with me.I sure you can get them made in this country.there is a hat factory in harrisburg IL. american cap co. who would like your business. thank you gail furlow
B00GWUCIX4|5|I get so many compliments on this scarf. Awesome.
B00SG849EQ|3|I really wanted to like these ones, they fit nice and snug enough to stay in place, but after some hours the will be completely uncomfortable, they will roll and look like skirts. Sorry couldn't give a goo review on this product.
B00J7ZXYWA|5|Perfect!
B00OTYOF7C|4|Like this hat a lot!  Fit's my 6 month's enormous 96th percentile head and is soft jersey.  Easy throw in the diaper bag and not worry about it being crushed.
B00F36MS0G|5|This mask was exactly as it was described! Our son loves this mask and was really pleased the quality and craftsmanship of this item. Not a plastic piece but real heavy ceramic and it is just beautiful. Love it!! No regrets whatsoever!!! One happy customer!!
B00GA7IL1W|2|Ran extremely small
B008SV95U4|5|Attractive and very comfortable have had many compliments. It also washes wonderfully.
B00EDF08X2|3|First time I washed it I couldn't wear it again until I bought a tank top to wear under it.
B004O8M304|5|Love these. 2nd pair we've gotten. Very durable
B000OYZBC4|5|This bra gives a really lovely shape without the pain that most underwires give.  The cup provides a bit more coverage than most bras, especially on the sides and over the top for those who tend to get that muffin top spillover effect with not enough coverage.  Yet, it is not your mamma's ugly corset - it's sexy and pretty.  It's the best of both - support and beauty.
B00A2V3KK4|4|Cute. Got these for Christmas pjs. Both girls wore them every night. One, 7 mos pregnant, wore them with shorts, well into the day. I took that as a sign she liked it.
B007RB91C8|1|I wore the black side only of this belt 2-3 times a week.  Pretty quickly, it began to show folds near the holes.  Within about a year, it completely broke apart at the most popular hole.  Poor quality - stay away.
B005S6AIYE|5|VERY PRETTY! JUST WHAT I WANTED FOR HIS SPECIAL DAY.  I AM HIS GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.
B009S5I028|5|Love this dress. I get compliments on it every time I wear it. The fabric is soft and it's not see through at all which i like.
B008YY8T66|5|This is just as cute as the picture. I was looking for a gift for my daughter so she wouldn't have to carry her big purse everywhere and this was perfect!!  She can now put just the items she needs to take with her when she goes out and doesn't have to worry about lugging along her big purse. And it is so pretty!!  Best gift I got her yet!!!
B00F36MS6U|5|Loved the mask!!
B00204RGRE|5|I found this hat last summer (2010) when I saw it on someone at the pool. Fell in love with it, but did not get mine until Jan 2011. I love that it stretches over my poof of hair, and the bigger brim protects my face, shoulders & upper back, which are all prone to burn more than the rest of me. I actually came home from vacation with a brim shaped tan line on my back. lol I also love that it is \\"wire rimmed\\" so I can fold up the back brim when sitting up at the pool as well as laying on my back I can fold up the back & the front down to protect my face.
B005KUAO1K|3|I'm sure it will fit you great if you are under a 38DD. Unfortunately for me, I'll have to stick with x-large, stuffy, animal costumes like cow, monkey, and bear suits. It is very cute though! :) It is a bit short too, but I am 5'7&#34; to 5'8&#34;, and let's face it, all of the Halloween costumes are pretty revealing these days...except for the bear, cow, and monkey suits,= of course! Good luck! :)
B00JUM4ILQ|5|Finally quality clothing and a zip up option!
B0009MZVU8|5|Looking for light weight walking/hiking socks. Liked the reviews so took the plunge. Glad I did; these socks are perfect for me. I highly recommend them.
B00FSOEQUI|4|I only gave this 4 stars because the black glitter around the neck is SO cute but it came off all over my daughters neck and looked strange! Hoping a wash will fix the problem some!
B0091U7QRU|5|I gave these board shorts for women a five star rating because for me they were perfect!  Pretty true to size, I am 5'5 at 157lbs.  I purchased a size 13 and it fit nicely.  Really like the cut, just long enough to cover the parts of my thighs I wanted to hide without being so long and looking like a man's swim short.  Very stylish and they got to my house quickly!!
B00IHUWNW8|5|My son is obsessed with Sonic, and so this shirt is a huge hit.  We can't wash it fast enough.
B008R00H5S|3|Shipping was on time, everything came in one big box.  The card reader isn't the same one that is shown in the picture but it works.  The tripod on the other hand is a piece of junk.  The camera mount doesn't even stay on the tripod securely, it comes loose after moving it around a bit.  If you were to hold the tripod at an angle the camera is surely going to fall right off.
B000VO6P3G|4|These are adorable and wash well. A great idea, but they are definitely built for bigger babies (\\"one size\\" is a stretch). They hang like big, droopy pant legs on my 2-month-old.
B00J9KQN44|5|Awesome socks! Wore them for my wedding!
B009XDLFTK|5|i really like this shirt , it is a little tight , and a little short , i am hoping after a wash it will losen up a little , i have other shirts from Lucky Brand and they were snugg like this one and after a wash they did loosen up
B0026KQK7E|5|This skirt was a great buy and fit perfectly.  I was so scared it wasn't going to work but sure enough it did. I already ordered more!
B004G14CEE|5|He likes it
B00EIFHB46|5|great product at a great price
B0018OMIMK|1|Bought a pair of 505's in Sept 2014 and foud that Levi's has changed the length of the front pockets. I measured the pockets of the new 505's against an older pair. The pockets are now about an inch and a half shorter than before and the result is that it is very uncomfortable to keep my cell phone in my pocket.    Unless Levi's puts the depth back into the pockets - I will have to go to another brand.    I have been a loyal Levi's jeans buyer for over 40 years - but I guess I'll have to go shopping with a ruler next time in order to find pockets that can fit my Galaxy S5 with comfort.    With Apple coming out with the new iPhone 6 Plus - they would be smart to listen to their customers and put the original length back in the pockets.    I have added a picture of the pockets side by side (old versus new shorter ones) in the customer images section.    If these jeans had the original longer pockets, I would have given 4 or 5 stars - please see my other reviews as this is my first negative one. I am more inclined to give praise than to dwell on the negative - but in this case I think Levis is trying to save a tiny bit money on having less material in their pockets resulting in the dissatisfaction of their customers. See the reviews on the Levi's own website - http://reviews.us.levi.com/1341/3696695/reviews.htm
B003L4YV52|4|I have bought so many of these.  As gifts, for friends, family and stocking stuffers.  They really are the softest socks in the world.  Wear well
B00F4WN3DU|5|I have been searching for wool sweaters for my husband(wool addict) for years with very little success until now.  Very few stores are carrying wool sweaters and when I have ordered on line the products have usually been disappointing since I was looking for a heavy knit sweater.  This one fit the bill and then some.  Heavy weight but still soft and comfortable.  And the prices are amazing!  I have paid 3 times as much and not been anywhere near as satisfied.  I will be ordering this sweater in more colors and trying other styles.  Thanks so much Woolovers.
B00B1EWBQ0|5|I love Dalmatians so I needed this robe. It is very soft and comfortable. It's a great bath robe
B002GU7KAA|5|I have bought the earlier generations of this bra in the past. This one is has softer fabric and an even better fit. This bra looks great (adds a 1/2 cup size in a natural looking way) and is super comfortable on small breasted women.
B005SJIRUS|5|I have to say that for all the stuff that I carry, this wallet definitely helped reduce the size of my previous one in half, while still having everything that I need. And at the same time, it won't allow me to be a pack rat. Definitely recommend it if that's your goal.
B00FI3P5K4|5|Works
B00NMQR6IS|5|Excellent
B008XCPPB6|4|Small.. Love the quote on inside
B00PU4H6FS|5|Such a popular dress with our little Frozen fan.  She wears it as often as she can.  It is very comfortable and fits great.
B00RE75NTU|4|When purchasing this dress if you normally wear size 12  you have to order a size 14 to get a perfect fit.  I normally wear size 14 and I bought a size 16 I have no regrets the dress fit perfect it somewhat makes your tummy look flat.
B00DEYMSEU|4|Didn't fit me but seemed well made
B00D7WFNCI|5|Great buy
B00W0TGJCW|3|The skirt is snug but still looks and fits great I am bigger boned and do have large breasts so The top sadly didn't fit! I'm an XL but I love the color
B00OWN16HC|5|I ordered a size 5xl based on the recommended measurements and it fits perfectly (I wear a size 16/18 in pants). For the price paid, this is a really great corset. I bought it for a con and wore it 2 days in a row; it's still holding its shape rather well.
B0038QWLFK|5|I am by no stretch of the imagination \\"skinny\\" but these jeans fit and look stunning. They wash well but need to me line- dried. Not a big deal. This is my 4th pair of NYD jeans and I will stick with them. Well made.
B0015PA2HU|5|I was not sure about buying this item because this style of shirt doesn't always fit well.  However, this shirt was a perfect fit!  I wore and washed it 2 times and then noticed that about 6\\" of the stitching was coming loose.  D'oh!  I contacted the seller via email, explained the issue and he immediately Express Mailed me a no-charge replacement, even though I had not requested he do that.  It cost him $6 just for the postage to do that.  THAT is great service and I will definitely be ordering from him again!
B00HXC9YOQ|5|The choice was either &#34;fits as expectefd&#34; or too small / big.  How about &#34;fits perfectly&#34;?  They do.  They are knit and are soft and comfortable and pretty as well.  They are not too heavy for summer and I love them.  Often cotton KNIT are too hot for me in the summer as compared to any woven cotton such as lawn or batiste.
B00306FHNG|3|Won't buy this again
B005DTTEIW|5|This polo shirt was perfect for my son.  The color (purple) is vibrant and didn't bleed when laundering.  The fabric is thick and the quality is great!  Highly recommended!
B00H6BX0YO|2|I am 75 kilo, and as rule I buy medium size things. this one is good quolity but very small.
B00ISZ7FOS|5|Fit really cute
B004QF0TI8|5|Good value
B00963TZ9O|1|It dose not worth the money shoulder to waist is too short my wife couldn't wear it even!!!! its waste of money
B005PQQ2OW|4|I thought I had big thighs so the Relaxed Fit size sounded appealing. But these pants had a nearly rectangular profile, more accurately a trapezoid with what seemed to be a straight line from widest part of the butt down to the heel. Somehow the side view photo doesn't capture the look, or maybe it's just more pronounced with my 29-inch inseam. Anyway, I have no use for all that extra material hanging beneath my tail, so I'm exchanging for a D3 Classic.
B0067WOZ9W|1|If you're looking for the good old FTL from yesteryear, good luck.  These are imported from Honduras and are beyond cheap.  Thin material, not much elastic in the waistband, fit is nothing like the old style.  The old style had the sewn in label and was made in Mexico of much better material and cut to a better standard.  These are just poor quality and are, unfortunately, the same as being sold at wally world.  I'm not sure where to go to get the Made in Mexico ones if they even still make them down there.  If this is the only choice, I've got to change 66 years of underwear buying habits and find another brand.
B000JWJ00K|5|I got these for my husband for Christmas and he loves them. This past winter we had ice, snow and it even got down to single digits; but he was warm. I think this was the best Christmas he got because he can't stand the cold. We live in middle Georgia so we don't normally see snow or single digits so he was happy he could stay warm even with the freakishly cold weather we've had. I bought them 4 sizes bigger then he normally wears and two inches shorter. He normally wears a 32 x 36 they were just a tiny bit too long but washing them changed that. Now they fit perfectly! I'm glad they were as warm as advertised because people were complaining how much colder it felt here compared to places like Michigan.
B00FJG5Q1S|5|Good quality shirt and the colors are great!
B0081ESW4I|5|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my great-niece.  They live out of state from me and my niece let me know she loves the outfit!  I thought it was adorable and my great-niece loves Minnie Mouse.
B00F4UTQG0|2|We returned this, it not only runs small but we couldn't tell online that there are sparkles all over shirt. Very thin material.
B00ARH8LLG|5|Great work shorts for construction.  Nice fit and comfortable.
B008CPWDDW|5|First off i just received the two wallets i ordered yesterday, one was for my dad and one was for my self. I have to say it seems like the wallets are made with okay quality the only flaw i have been able to notice it to much glue was used for one the card holders,but other then that I have to say they seem like they should last some time compared to cheap wallets. i was recommend this wallet to anyone!!
B00940G98E|5|This was perfect for my sons first Halloween. I knew that I had to make the face and the kit comes with everything to cut the eyes, nose, and mouth. I actually changed the mouth a little from the pattern. The price was great and we can easily wear the hat and pants with any shirt for wear besides Halloween. Great zutano priht and quality!
B0029F1WZG|4|I ordered the large-sized mens Next Gen Deluxe Blue Shirt for Halloween.  Loved it.  I got a mens' shirt because they only had women's jumpsuits or skimpy dresses.  I wanted a large one because I was afraid a small one would be too tight at the hips (which I have).  It worked out great with black pants, Spock ears, Spock wig and awesome make-up.
B00DVFR6B2|5|It's cute and has a beautiful color!  It fits nicely and very comfortable!  I had Breast Reconstruction after Cancer and need a comfortable bra and this one is all that!
B00NZH5S0C|2|The shirt looked really good however it was small throughout the shoulders. The quality of the shirt was really good though.
B002NSM3MU|5|I wanted a hat that was durable, stylish, and had the ability to be shaped and re-shaped. This hat covered all the bases. It is a deep weathered brown, very comfortable and can be shaped to a number of styles.
B0093XXZ1Q|3|This jumpsuit is very confortable, however i do think you have to have the bodily shape for this jumopsuit to fit how you expect it. I was hoping for a snug fit on top and a bit loser on the bottom with the appropriate amount of tunch showing. The elastic band was in a weird area and made my shape look like i had a muffin top and it kept rising in the crouch and tunch area. I did give this to a heavier set woman and it was actually cute so I would say order small for big girls, my personal opinion.
B003G91HO0|5|Great gift idea for gun lovers.
B00IRJFIV2|5|Quick shipping. Good fit and good quality tshirt. It was a big hit at my brothers Big Bang Theory birthday party!
B00AKQONM0|5|Perfect transaction.  Great fit.  Love these capris!!  Bought several pairs of CK in different styles!  Very comfortable and easy fit.
B005J3T630|4|I ordered these pants for me , according to the size chart , bought the 6P , for the next must buy the size 4P , because I was left a little loose. But they are beautiful and high quality . I 'll buy in my size
B00OLC6J7Q|5|My boyfriend love he's new bag, good size and quality.
B00CJJD2GO|5|This dress is very flattering.  I am a 32 year old mom, so it's nice to find something stylish that is loose.  I probably would not trust the pockets.  Anything too small may fall out and anything heavy would weigh the dress down.  They do add a nice drapey line to the dress.  I ordered a size small and it fits perfectly. Kensie sizes seem comparable to brands found at anthropologie.
B008FXBF26|5|This dress and bolero fit perfectly and they look fabulous. Appropriate for work or church. I will definetly buy this brand again.
B00DS1IZLE|1|Size runs really small. Very thin and cheap feeling. Ok if you want to wear them around the house and not in public.
B00DYQR6JK|5|I cannot believe what a great deal this snow bib is.  It's an authentic Columbia product, so it is very warm and durable.  I love the extendable-fit feature which adjusts the pant length to grow with your child.  Fits my 6-year-old son perfectly, with a little room to grow!  I give this product my highest recommendation!
B00QYARHBA|5|Classy dress for special occasions or night out.  Great fit, rich colour styling and with an affordable price.  Will continue to buy this brand!  Thank you Amazon.
B0071N3HPY|5|If you're looking for a soft lined rain jacket that is also cute, this is a great purchase. My 1 yr old son wears size 18 months, so I ordered size 2T and rolled up the elastic sleeves so he can grow into it. The jacket is made of high quality material and feels durable. We got lots of compliments from his friends and daycare teachers.
B002IADJ80|5|Fit as expected, Very warm clothes
B003XPHVR4|5|I had been looking all over for these jeans,,yea,,found them.  Great fit and look,,will be buying more at a later time
B00F2M7QSK|5|as an art major, and a huge fan of art history, I literally screamed when I saw this shirt!!! it is so awesome, and the fabric is soft. I love being complimented when wearing it! :D
B00WAAZHTM|1|the fabric feels nice I will give it that. But other than that... No. The pink is too dark. Not a light pink like the picture. I am a 32D and the fit is too big. The straps aren't adjustable to fix the problem and it hangs like a burlap sack on me and it's not flattering. Not a happy customer
B00F4PPUMO|3|The shirt looks just like it does in the photo but the material is really bad. It's, as I would describe, a plastic like material. I do not recommend.
B00DME00AQ|5|The high waist is the best invention ever made for woman kind. Regular tights and pantyhose can cut in at the waist which hurts but also creates ugly lines and bulges under dresses (and I am a size 4 with a tiny waist). These tights are amazing, they are opaque but not too thick so comfortable. And the high waistband sits perfectly flat around your ribs right under your bra, and it stays put all day and doesn't roll or cut. I am 5'8\\" and the C-D size fits perfectly.
B0099SH926|5|Love it
B005GTPZG4|5|Cute clothes at a good price. Baby will look super cute in them this spring. Will be good Christmas presents.
B00KYP11SG|5|I'm 20 years old and I have quite a large head and these hats fit me with little more room to grow. I wouldn't worry about the size for these items. There was some little extra threading but that could be easily fixed by just using a pair of scissors. The delivery was also great. I recommend it!
B00KSO4540|5|Really nice purchase & looks even better than pictured
B00LKKW07K|5|I ordered the small Elephant kigurumi's for a 10 year old and it fit her perfectly! She loves it :D
B001D0DUGM|1|I bought this wallet thinking a brand like tommy should be more than enough but in fact the color is fading on the original box and to many scratches that i noticed before opening the box I will never buy any thing from tommy again I was thinking of giving this wallet as a gift but I cant
B004WY8NTU|5|Material was nice and light, dried quickly and fit very well.  My 15 year old son wore it on the cruise and had no complaints (highly unusual!) since he complains about most everything!
B009H6L9RQ|3|Got  this for my gf's xmas gift. She liked it, it's slightly smaller than I thought. But good material. Hold up well considering how many times she's worn and washed it.
B00BT9MFJK|4|Love these pants!
B00EYXNDPI|5|i like the penguin logo, and the fabric is really nice and soft.  i bought a medium, and it isn't too small as I am somewhat muscular.  A large probably would have been fine as well but I am happy with the shirt and it's size.
B007VE4RAW|1|The material of this dress is terrible. It clings in all the wrong places.. Makes the skinniest person look fat. Would not recommend.
B00FQATKZ0|5|Once washed several times it still retains a great new texture. Very flattering, especially with the cinch in the back.
B00UTVUSX4|5|better than what you get from wal-mart and most superstores....
B00KYSU7CE|3|The fabric is of a cotton jersey blend but had very litte &#34;give&#34; in it you may want to go a size or 2  larger for a comfortable fit
B002YQ2GF0|1|So the tights are soft and they feel like they'll be pretty durable- the main problem is the waist.  I'm well within the size range listed but the waist is so tight it's painful and gives you that lumpy look as it squeezes you.  I'm 5'5 and 113 lbs, bought the small/medium.  It shouldn't be that tight and fits just fine in every other regard, but it's simply not wearable due to the waist.  If your aiming for a painful day, this is a great way to go!<br /><br />If it had been at all wearable, I would have given it a couple stars at least but they are not wearable.
B006QHNE18|5|nice fit
B0028681ZA|2|I am a 36 D/DD right now and have a smallish frame (I'm only 5' tall), and the large is so tight around the bottom elastic. I feel like I have to be very careful when taking it on and off so I don't Hulk out and rip it to shreds! I'm hoping it will stretch out a bit in time. The material is nice.
B000VPG5SA|5|Great fit for our 1 year old son and it was thick enough to keep him warm and comfortable. Recommend.
B0002CB6PE|5|I HAD THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM SANUK.... <br />FIRST OFF, THEIR PRODUCTS ARE EXTREMELY DURABLE, LONG LASTING ITEMS... <br />THE ONLY TIME I EVER BOUGHT A PAIR OF SANDALS FROM THEM AND HAD A BAD (IF YOU CAN CALL IT THAT) EXPERIENCE, WAS WHEN I HAD A FAULTILY MADE PAIR OF SANDALS, AND THE THONG PART BROKE... <br />ALL I HAD TO WAS EMAIL THEM, AND THEY SENT ME ANOTHER PAIR ABSOLUTELY FREE! <br />I LOVE THIS COMPANY, AND WILL CONTINUE TO NET PROMOTE... <br />THANKS FOR THE BUSINESS, SANUK! <br />-CHRIS-
B00IXWZ0AW|5|First I must say I am usually size 30 so if size 28 fits me perfectly  you must take this in consideration when chosing a size. I have purchase a couple of tank tops in the past they are very low quality in general, but  I must say this shorts are different, very good fabric quality and nice almost perfect fitting, the color is great too
B000N5BK88|5|Outstanding
B002SHRQYG|2|I only wear Diesel jeans and have the exact same cut, in a different wash. These are no where near the same fit. The waist is roughly the same, but the legs are enormous. There is absolutely no tapering from the thigh to the cuff, resulting in enormous billows of fabric around the calfs. I'm a runner, and tend to have fairly large legs so this was a bit of a surprise to me.<br /><br />Yes, I understand that they are straight cut, but again, I have a pair of Larkee that do not fit like this. My guess is that because they are made in Tunisia rather than Italy, the quality isn't the same.<br /><br />I had to return these.
B00R5A2FNS|5|Excellent Detail and looks great!!!! Looks event better live....<br /><br />The fit runs generous...<br /><br />Awesome looking jacket...good pricing for Adidas Wear!
B008GSGN7W|5|Great quality, excellent product, would definitely buy again!  Rugby shirts have changed a bit since I last wore them... but these are phenomenal.  Very good quality -- matches my son's little Ireland jersey well!
B004QMLQYW|5|But it is weak.
B00FFS3T6Y|5|A bit big but they are very pretty.  I can't wait to wear them to dinner during the summer with a sundress.
B0041VSLS2|5|looks great on
B010B0FB2A|3|Great feeling shirt, but the collar is wider than most tshirts
B005UC0Z4O|5|dress is a beautiful burnt orange colour. nice fabric and my niece will love to wear it this summer. the dress is very different from the usual strapless dresses available for little girls
B00SOAHFZQ|2|It was way too large so i returned it
B00N256RG6|5|Good price, well made, delivered timely.
B00TE7FCZS|5|Good fit, nice sweats
B007C57TA0|5|Fit wonderfully. Doesn't feel cheaply made, material feels plush and stitching is strong. I'd buy again in a heartbeat. Love it!
B00H7IJN8I|2|Seemed like a good product but the XL ran on the small side and the XXL was too long in the sleeves. Other than that was pretty well made
B00LGPG8N6|5|Awesomely cutte
B00JSJ5J0U|5|Excellent pair of shorts.
B0081YZFC0|5|the size is exactly as expected. the material are very high quelity. I will recomanded this jacket to my friends.
B005HUCB9G|5|This is a really nice tie for what you pay.  It will wiggle loose throughout the day, but what do you expect?  It's not an expensive tie.  Colors look nice and its length is good.  I am about six two and have an 18 1/2 inch neck.  You will be cinching this back up throughout the day, but overall a really nice tie.  Plus you won't be wearing it year round probably so considering the amount it gets worn, the price can't be beat.
B00822C2S6|4|very girly
B0000ANDPW|5|I love that high waist (\\"sits at natural waist\\").  Now that I have a little belly, so many lower-rise pants roll forward several hours into the work day. These stay comfortable and make me look at least a *little* trimmer than I really am nowadays.
B003MWCOLG|1|I used to love these socks.  But a few months ago they changed the shape and size of all their diabetic socks.  They are now extremely narrow and extremely long.  Apparently trying to save money on fabric.  They do not even fit on my calf and are too tight on my feet now.  I had a spare pack of some I had bought a little over a year ago and compared the new \\"and improved\\" ones with those.  The older ones are cut more generously in the ankle and toe area and aren't as high on the calf.  So unless you have extra narrow feet shaped like canoes then you will not like these.  I noticed this on both regular AND big sizes.  The \\"big\\" size is exactly the same width as the regular size except ridiculously long.  So if you have extra narrow feet and a skinny calf say in the shape of a boomerang from calf to toes then these are for you.  If you can wear these \\"new design\\" socks then you can wear a regular sock that cost much less.  Thanks a lot greedy cheap skates at Dr. Scholls!    Notice that most if not all of the five star ratings were purchased at least 7 months ago.  My guess is that production changed on these some time in 2012 or 2013.  So once Amazon and your favorite store runs out of the older \\"better\\" designed socks then get ready to say \\"G'day mate. Check out my new boomerang sheath.\\"
B00DQCLFUS|3|These gloves came unsewed after the first lundering.
B00QQYOX4I|3|there was a delay in shipping, I had to follow up with the seller several times to figure out what was going on with my order which was pretty annoying. The item was marked as shipped but was not actually sent out for days after that. As for the product, I am 5 2 and weight 171 lbs and I ordered the XXL long. the item isnt really that much longer that the regular ones but its not too short. I love the color the pink is really nice and bright and the item is good quality but it took much longer to arrive the advertised 2 day priority took and about a week which normally would be fine but I bought it for a particular occasion based on the advertised two day shipping. I can't really use it, I know they are supposed to be really tight at first but it doesn't fit properly and I measured with room to spare on the size chart. Maybe I can use it in the future :/
B00M8OOLWO|5|Liked it a lot
B00HHKM6U8|2|I usaully wear an x large but this was about three times to big, I returned it and ordered a small.
B005OATJ44|5|Beautiful shirt! Arrived in perfect condition and promptly. My son was very happy. Recommend highly.
B000TCFTIM|4|Comfortable fit for call day comfort. Cute design. Fun but professional. Got lots of compliments since the first time I wore it.
B001PO5J9W|5|bought it for my friend who is a wolverine freak. He put it on and ran around the house. some material needed to be cut from inside the eyes but that was a simple fix
B00EWAZTEG|2|I like the thickness of the sweater, but the sleeves are super short while the torso seems too long. It's an awkward fit and I probably won't wear it again, so I'm a little disappointed I even bought it. Plus, it took a few weeks to even arrive.
B00EZE8U3G|5|This fit beautifully. I received many compliments. The shoulders and back have enough coverage you can wear a bra. It has built in pads but they don't offer any support if you need it. and it is hard to find something I really feel great in but I sure did in this.  You will show some cleavage, the empire waist disguises tummy (not belly) and it flows very nicely. If you are wearing in a big crowd moving around or standing up and sitting down constantly i.e. standing ovations you'll have to watch out for the train but it looked so great it was worth it.  I bought one in black and emerald green and am keeping both.
B000A2KJWM|5|Cute, pretty pink, super durable!!! I like how my girls can slip on their flip flops and go! Worth the price and great, fast shipping with Prime membership!!!
B00CMQ9KQK|4|The wallet is nice but after I put all my ids and important businesses cards in it gets thick and slightly uncomfortable in your back pocket
B009JNI83K|5|Excellent quality. Excelente producto. Love it's texture. Fits amazing. Talla fenomenalmente bien. Awesome cost benefit relation. Without doubt I recommend this product
B008U0KLNS|1|These were the shoddiest merchandise I have ever bought online. The clips would not fasten. I would have returned them, but I had discarded the packaging.
B00DFQMPVI|5|I got this for my college-aged daughter and she wears it all the time. She ties it together and makes a little vest out of it- people comment on it all the time. It is cute.
B009YR6504|4|Was too small, however the reason I ordered XS is because I don't like the ties in the back, or the gathering in the back, on different tops that are offered, this is more of a unisex top which always runs big and short ( I find mostly for men) but I found with your company it's tailored more to a woman's body, I would highly recommend this product, it is shown in top and bottom in many bright colors, I purchased 4 right off the bat in great colors, but I thought when purchasing it was sold as a set, top and bottom.   Sincerely Treva Windham
B000L7L5B0|3|The socks seem to run small I wear a size 7 shoe and they just fit, the cushion sole is not thick.  I would not buy them again.
B00Q2PAMV4|1|I never thought I would have to write a review this bad but here it goes....and its when i wish there was a way to make this a negative star review it is THAT bad of an item.<br />i bought this item figuring it wouldn't be the BEST item out there as it was 3.99, even if it was only a markdown from the whopping 9.99 it was. I shiver thinking of the poor soul who actually paid the full price for this piece of garbage<br />It came from China, so it already took a long time to get here (roughly a month after purchase) which I ALSO expected because of the location in which is was shipping from. But never did I think I would wait a month for a literal scrap cloth that was falling apart at every seam<br /><br />i took just 2 photos to show this, and mind you this is ON EVERY part of the item that holds it together. So the thin straps holding the v shaped breast area (second photo is shown with double sided tape ghetto holding it together) is hanging by a thread. The actual fabric to hold the bottom of the breast is also coming undone from it at well (shown in the first picture)<br />The weird &#34;handcuffs&#34; are interesting, the lace is cheap and bundles up and when you try to fix it , shortly later it will roll itself back up....plus the elastic is A LOT longer than it is being shown in the images, I mean that is straight up arm aerobics length with no resistance...<br />that and the same is said about the garter belt  which has the same cheap lace with the same issue as the handcuffs. then the mask is a really small and wrinkled and the band is almost a childs size rather than adult....<br /><br />as i could not get a classy picture to show the threads holding the weird butt cape to the thong i cant show that example, but yea its hanging on by a thread there<br />and i would say that maybe it was the one size thing to an average American body size that could've torn it, but it was like that when i pulled it out and when i put it on it just showed how bad it was<br /><br />there is no clear return policy on this POS and quite frankly I'm fuming and I wish this waste of money would just disappear<br />so buy beware, don't buy this garbage. you're wasting your time and money
B00505DVGK|5|It was perfect for our superhero themed birthday party!  Not a huge investment.
B00IAB5DW6|2|cheaply made.  it is a printed image and only blank white on the back.  that wouldn't be a problem, but you have a defined line of color/white running down the sides of your body
B009YZRE7E|5|High quality merchandise at a reasonable price. It got here so quickly that I was SHOCKED!!!  A wonderful shopping experience.
B00MYNGHZI|4|Perfect fit for my daughter, knit sweater was soft and warm. Even after wash it kept it's size and didn't shrink.
B00HNIZZJI|5|I'd been looking for a romper for awhile and hadn't been able to find any that fit and didn't look too young on me. I'm only 4' 7&#34; and under 100lbs so it's hard for me to find clothes. This fits great and is cute. Can't wait for summer!
B003IC96TI|4|With a few modifications this ended up being a great Halloween costume. It was a little loose in the bodice, but the sleeves fit great and were not too tight. Because of the glitter in the skirt fabric, I used a steamer to remove the wrinkles which made the skirt lay smoothly. The attached cape was too short for my taste so I removed all the little velcro dots and sewed on a new long red cape; which also disguised the lack of glitter on the back side of the skirt.
B00LUEVPUY|5|I love this dress it looks so cute on my daughter it also shipped very fast I got it with in a few days I got a size 4 my daughter is 37 inches tall and weighs 35pnds and the 4 fits great
B00MM3OYUK|5|Item arrived on time and was well received, great quality dress. I purchased it for my cousin and she loved it so much she wore it around Disney world.
B00LWQ533A|5|Being pregnant for the first time, this is all brand new, but these did not fail!  Exactly what I needed!
B00E1BZBM6|3|Cute socks. Cute packaging but misleading description. They're seven mismatched socks. Not worth the price but they're quality socks. Thanks
B00LW99OVY|3|Love these jeans!
B0063UKIJE|5|I love this outfit and it fits so well! My fiance def loved walking in the house with this on my body! Hope to find more like it
B004LQHQ2Y|4|The boot fit pretty well, med was a good 7 1/2 - 8. The tube was a bit snug on my wife's leg, and she's not thick
B0009FH14E|5|I stumbled across this shirt in a local store but they only carried 1 in the size I needed. After some hunting I found them here on Amazon for less.    The shirt quality is great! The fabric resists both work wear and home wear with the addition of lots of kitty cats and their claws. After several washes the shirt has retained both its original size and color. It took about 2 washes for the fabric to soften down to a normal level which it has kept since then (a couple of months of wearing the shirt twice a week).    Even after a long day at work crawling around on the floor working with wiring the shirt still looks good enough to wear out to a social event. I would describe the overall look as work casual but with good comfort.    The sizing feels great. I usually wear a 3X and they have enough room to do whatever I need to do without feeling pinched or tight in any spot or showing the top of my belt line. After getting some 3X size I did purchase some 4X which I have liked better in the super hot weather we have been having.
B00MHWK0FO|3|Very cute dress, but unfortunately the material gives no stretch at all. I couldn't get it zipped up over my boobs. The XL would work best on someone with a 34-36&#34; waist and cup size no larger than a DD.
B001UN739C|3|Comfy and so forth. Machine wash and dry, really? Threw it in the trash after the plastic clasp melted and fell off in the dryer (low heat, even.)
B009FZ78BU|5|This shirt is beautiful,a must have for any twilight fan. It is of great fabric and the picture is durable, not one of the cheap iron-on that peel around the edges. This shirt is good quality and I would purchase again. NO COMPLAINTS HERE! If you are a twilight fan definitely order.
B0038ZBG16|2|We ordered the small but it was just that- too small. we ended up returning it. MIght order a larger one later on.
B00FHK4DVA|5|Very nice i love
B007KFZDMS|5|This brand is always a nice fit.  When I see a different color I am inclined to purchase.  Some other name brands are hit or miss for proper fitting.
B00ZZP86XS|2|Not good support
B00C2217DI|4|My husband is a tall-big guy. The size that I bought him fits perfectly on him. The fabric quality is decent.
B008JRTPDO|5|Stylish, well made…Beware though…this coat is only good for cold weather…it is not for days in the 30's so much as days in the teens…It is SUPER warm, but I get overheated if I try to wear it and it isn't freezing out.  That is a compliment..but just know that it is a cold weather coat!
B00LN60PNC|5|I put fit as expected but keep in mind the sizing is 2 sizes lower than US sizes.
B00PZKXOLM|5|The dress is perfect. Very nice for work or going out to dinner. Perfecr fit.
B00TZ9LXEY|5|It can sooner than I expected
B006RKV3US|5|Good
B001AERR56|5|this is a gtareat buy for a Indiana Jones Fedora. the brim is not real high and the pitch is perfect. have not worn when rains(hasn,t rained since bought) A great present for young or old. and i looked in many retail stores and online, this was thebest deal, will buy again from them. will always buy from amazon.com
B00CRXLKOS|3|I've bought this same 550 jean for roughly 15 years and watched the quality of construction slowly go downhill. Love the fit, love the look. Just not holding up as they did in the past.  Denim is lighter. Seam stitching isn't as heavy of thread. Belt loops rip out more easily.<br />I used to be able to count on them lasting several years with 2x a week wear or sometimes more. Now 1-2 years tops, but only if I'm willing to stitch belt loops back when they come loose.
B00BB8VV12|5|Cute fits great my daughter loved it and it I got it for a Great price. Fits well on her
B001MRQ8TC|3|Not bad for a costume.
B00ADI0KOK|1|Don't purchase this , it doesn't work
B00SL36UW0|5|I purchased this belt for my husband because I wanted something that offers him additional style instead of the same boring belts he always wears. I was so happy that the belt fits hims great and he wears a size 38 pants and he loves the design of the belt as well. This belt can be worn for many occasions if needed to dress up or just going out to dinner it offers a versatile fashion piece. I believe this would look great on all age ranges and highly recommend for any gentlemen looking to purchase the perfect belt. The belt easily closes and stays locked in place according to the tightness you prefer. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
B001CVCMPW|5|Enjoyed wearing this. It kept me warm enough while on the pub crawl in a mid-Atlantic autumn. I may even wear this next year!
B00L3EU1H4|5|Beautiful coat, and fits well. I purchased a Small and am 5'4&#34; and 110 lbs. Only problem is in packing that it was wrinkled at the collar and at the sleeves. I will have to steam or dry clean to get those folds out since it is wool.
B000RGUV24|5|Just received these. I own Maui Jim's, Sarengetti, many others and these are the nicest - especially for this price. The modulator lens is awesome. You can actually see very well in low light. Highly recommended.
B005GQTJ7S|5|Inexpensive and cute, just what I was looking for.  Several of the reviews for other &#34;21&#34; tiaras said they were too small and made for little girls, whereas this one was going to be the right size for an adult.  The size was big enough for an adult as the reviews for this tiara stated.  It was just what I needed for my daughter's assistant volleyball coach who would be turning 21 while we were traveling for a big tournament.  She didn't wear it for very long, but I know she secretly enjoyed it!  The included sash was great as I didn't have to buy a feather boa or something similar to complete the festive look.
B00H5MBYTM|5|These were great for my daughter's halloween costume.  I think they would be a little small for an adult.
B003R0Y0QU|1|Initially, I thought this was going to be a fantastic purchase.  The first time I wore them, loved them.  They were smoothing and non-binding and stayed in place.  Second time I put them on about a week after the first, they kept sliding down my back side.  I pulled them up a couple of times.  Third time I pulled them up, they ripped bigger than Dallas.  Won't be buying these again.  What a waste of money.  For $33, they shouldn't rip  - EVER!  You would think this was a pair of Leggs $3 pantyhose, not $33 Spanx!
B004GHKXRI|5|Feel nice.
B00R5AZXI2|4|Fit perfectly! go with a size bigger than what you actually are though
B00XK8KDGK|4|I'm rather tall so this comes more as a long top and at a 38DD it uh, is stunning to see the reactions I get. I love the colours and the fabric is soft and thin. This certainly turns heads without compromising.
B00BPIMU2C|5|excellent!
B00L2CXVQ0|2|It was an ok shirt, was dissoppointed in the fabric and size. It wa not a stretchy fabric and the size ran SUPER small, and I had ordered a large. Very cute shirt but you have to be very very petite to wear it.
B00IS9GJLE|5|Excellent material- really heavy and durable
B000AMJWB6|4|Not being a regular hat-wearer (other than ball caps) I didn't know what size I wore. Fortunately in my city there is an old-school hat shop that sells Tilley and many other brands. I stopped in and tried on one of the light weight Tilley hats and the sales clerk helped me find my size which was 7 3/8 leaving room for two fingers to comfortably slide into the band at the forehead. However the hat I was interested in was the hemp TH5 with the narrower brim and they only had TH4's with the wider brim. I tried on the TH4 in 7 3/8 and it fit well. So, even though I don't like to shop in a brick-and-mortar establishment and then take my business on-line, in this case they said they could no longer get the TH5 in Mocha only white. So I ordered it from Tilley on Amazon and expected to get the right fit, but what I got was a bit snug. Fits, but no way two fingers fit inside the band. Probably need a 7 1/2. Like the goof I usually am, I had already removed the tags and stuff and wore it around for about an hour to see if I could live with the fit. I probably can, but it is not as comfortable as it would be with a proper, looser fit. I bought it, I de-tagged it, I wore it, I guess I own it now. If I can ever save my pennies for another in 7 1/2 I may as I like the look and utility of the hat.
B00H1EXCX0|4|Got 2 for my kids at Christmas and they loved them.  Nice and warm inside and fit great.  Already washed in machine and hung up to dry, no troubles.
B00GJ8AFNE|5|its a beautiful and comfortable
B00IFYCBDC|1|The dress arrived much earlier than the estimated date.  The dress is really cute and the quality is good.  The bow around the waist is a little different, but overall, it's still good.  However, the dress is much much smaller than what I expected.  I order size 120 which is supposed to be size 6-7, according to their description.  And the dress I got is more like size 3-4. (The tag on the dress shows size 120). The length of the dress, when it lies flat, from the very top to the bottom is only 19 inches long.
B006X3XJZQ|1|It's bigger then I wanted!! Kinda sad!!
B00J33AIUW|5|So soft. Love them!
B004NEFMWK|2|Take care if buying this wig. It does not come as pictured in the photo, and I have serious doubts if anyone could get it into that hairstyle, even if you follow the instructions. It's actually curly and there are several curls that are impossible to keep down.
B00N0RSBZ6|5|This are the best pair of pants I've ever had!<br />They fit perfect! And they do no shrink at all when i washed them i am so happy!
B00GS16JWS|5|I originally ordered a women's large (when I typically wear a women's medium) and it was WAY too small.  I hopped over to the men's sizes and bought a medium.  5/5 fits perfect =)
B00FVS7EQO|3|This bag is only  somewhat small on the inside if your trying to fit a lot of books in it, otherwise it's fine.
B0045LY1NW|2|These socks were very large and also had holes in them I wish I had noticed before tossing the shipping slip.
B003IIMT46|5|This necklace is very well made to last for many years and the perfect touch to any gothic outfit.  It is sure to get complements.
B00B4TPX7G|5|My baby had eczema spots on her legs and ankles before. After wearing these a few days she no longer can scratch those areas and the eczema is under control again. Good quality material, soft and durable for my little crawler :)
B00SSQCIVW|5|My husband loves them. They look great and he says they are very comfortable especially after I washed them and used fabric softener.
B00LVFSPIW|1|Bottoms were too small and top was massive. Terrible fabric. Very disappointed.
B003OYJJGA|4|I bought this vest for my boyfriend a month ago. It's so soft and warm, but the size is one size bigger. Luckily it fits my dad very well. I would recommend this to my friend.
B00S1CVQD4|4|Comfortable and easy to use for nursing. Sizes seem to run a little large, but still works fine without stretching out too much.
B00L62BS5C|3|My daughter loves these pajamas.  The material is soft and comfortable for sleeping.  They run small.  My daughter is 13 and a junior size 4.  She got a medium and it just fit.
B0089KAHEW|5|My husband is a size 40 suit but a bit big in the hips. This parka is roomy enough to layer up underneath for skiing, and was not binding at all. It fits a bit boxy, so if you are a slim build, you may not find the fit flattering. I paid $50 for this coat during one of Amazon's one day sales before Xmas. I feel the workmanship, insulation, (even in the sleeves) waterproofing, and breathability is an excellent value for the money. I recommend this for anyone looking for a parka that will keep them warm in wet snow conditions.
B000RZ84AQ|5|I ordered 2 styles of this product and was pleased with the quality and the price. Comparable items on other sites were selling for more than double the price. A great bargain!
B00DJNQUYK|5|Great
B003X26S6W|5|very good
B00H6P2GQ8|5|We are so happy with this product we have had luck with all our products will keep ordering
B003ZJF6M0|5|purchased for my teen son, will order again
B00CJ6YMSY|4|I love this dress I was a little worried it wasn't goin to fit but it fits great. I'm thinking of getting a couple there's in different styles
B00SN60CCY|4|Very nice
B0058YRU7E|5|I would best describe this polo as a hybrid between a performance polo and a pique polo from say, Ralph Lauren.  It doesn't have the normal golf polo feel but it is very comfortable and easy on the skin.   The fit is great and there is no &#34;tennis tail&#34; which I love. The front and the back are equal in length. I will definitely be purchasing more
B0009MZY2S|5|Gives the cushion needed in all the right places.  Very durable.  Its the only sock I use now for walking
B00E0DI09G|4|This dress is a little loose but I really like it otherwise.  I bought it for a funeral and it is perfect.
B00I45C4M0|5|very nice colors.
B00IQIXDPC|5|Perfect jacket!
B00DYQGYLQ|5|Feels like a pair of old wrestling tights. I workout so my legs are bigger than normal. So they feel a little tight when you first put them on. But they really feel good. They are well made and don't inch up like others do. Sure does beat spending 50 bucks for a pair of other brands.  I've had the Calvin Kliens and Merona brand from Target and they only lasted for a year.
B00JLAYZ10|5|great value...great quality
B00H3A9KG0|5|Love it!!
B00AG2ONNC|5|was very well made and was the right size
B00AKSCK3C|3|Fit ok
B007P0HMVS|4|They looked fine, was surprised the material is a twill type.  Inconclusive as how they look of fit, son lives in another state
B004MKN8OY|5|I have recently been forced into a sedentary lifestyle because of back issues.  I have put on a lot of weight and needed extra large pants temporarily I hope.  There is not much choice at this size 42X29 however these pants look good and are comfortable.  I do expect and hope to revert to my earlier smaller size once I get fixed up medically, however these are pretty good in the interim.  I have been able to attend business meetings with confidence.
B00MCW6BPW|5|My daughter loves the dress, but its too tight on her. I thought it was elastic or stretchy material, my fault.
B00VMYUBCA|4|Fits good on me
B000N8X736|5|dickies jeans are always the best to buy, these were just want i wanted to replace an old pair. no problems with the purchase or the shipping.
B000WGFW9Q|5|Used these for a halloween costume. They are very beautiful, and very long: past elbows. They fit me, but I do have thin fingers and arms so I'm not sure if &#34;one size fits most.&#34; But I love them.
B00K6I2702|5|These shorts are awesome. Super comfortable and lightweight. I've become VERY particular about the clothing that I wear. For shorts, I look for lightweight, breathable clothing that washes easily and doesn't require much maintenance (e.g. ironing - check!). I actually bought a different pair of these in Hawaii a few months back when I was there. I loved them so much that I had to search the internets to find the exact type of shorts as Riptide makes several kinds of shorts and even several kinds of the Mirage line. These are my favorite shorts by far and they are quick drying so they can double as board shorts or boat shorts. Just make sure you are going commando or rocking some quick dry boxers (ExOfficio / Duluth Trading co) or quick drying shorts won't make a difference.<br /><br />Love these shorts. Have two pairs and wear them every single day. I've pretty much ditched all other shorts I own for these.
B009V4PZXS|5|looks wonderful and wears great
B00HY3MSFG|5|They looked better in person than I could have expected I'm very happy with my purchase.  The built in jock strap was a nice surprise.
B00DQXRZ92|5|I love my new leggins there everything and more :))))
B00E1ZPK64|4|I got this to wear for labor and delivery (has not happened yet!), and it is very cozy yet light after washing.  While I noted that it &#34;fits as expected,&#34; this is not yet quite true as I have a very pregnant belly for the robe to contend with.  However, even with that, it covers me pretty nicely and I expect that it will fit even better once I am wearing it for one instead of two ;)<br /><br />I am 5'7, and the robe hits me just below the knees, and the sleeves just reach my wrists.
B007KFZGVQ|3|This actually will hold the girls in so you can exercise. However it looks very very very strange under nearly any shirt.
B00JZXURNS|5|Love this hat. I always get compliments on it. It is very colorful and high quality and cute :)
B001O9BEI8|5|THERE ARE UNDERWEAR WHAT CAN I SAY!  HEY DO THE JOB!  GOOD BUY FOR NAMED BRAND....GOOD BRAND NAME.THEY WORK..WHAT ELSE CAN i SAY.
B00LHBQYYW|4|I love the quality & the print on it. Only thing is, I really wish since it is one size that it was a little bigger seeing as I'm not that big. I think I am going to cut the print out & sew it onto an over sized t-shirt I already have.  Also, the shirt is a silk-like material so it doesn't stretch. Overall I really like it & will do something with it. ^__^
B00OX55BTI|1|they came with the seam split open in one of the legs. I sewed it up. But, this is the 2nd pair of this brand that I have had this happen to.
B0056WQYIY|1|This ran even smaller than described.
B00BYWD13Q|5|It was a gift and a big hit!
B00E7Z7RSM|5|Just love it! Thanks.
B003O68QQM|5|Great if you are tall and very slim. My boyfriend is 5'11&#34; about 128lbs.
B006WFP9WG|2|Cheap material and cheap stitching. Did not return because I do still like the funky style. Will try to get the seams strengthened and see how it holds up. 4 stars for style and fitment, 1 star for quality.
B00OJCVQZS|5|I needed a new coat for my 7 year old because the zipper on his old one broke. It would have cost me $20 to fix. I figured with winter almost over, it wpuld be more economical to buy a new coat, a little bigger than his current size, so I wouldn't have to buy a new one next winter.<br /><br />This coat is great. It fit the way I was hoping it would, it's light weight but ker ps him warm in our snowy winter conditions, and he loves the designs on the sleeves. I am going to buy two more for my other two boys!
B003E89038|3|Belt only fits if 36 waist or smaller
B0065Q5WBU|5|Very comfortable to wear.  Especially in the summer heat.
B000PEAYAC|3|The shipping was fast.  The actual sock is cute and works well with many types of shoes, but after two times of wearing them, they ripped already.
B00QXGA55U|4|Great for my pilates class
B0051WSCYI|1|Was a very tight fit and looks nothing like the photo.  It took me half an hour to even figure out how to get it on!  I will never, ever wear this and should have just returned it.  A huge waste of money.
B00L4FAD0M|5|Beat local prices for the same product by a mile and got me one VERY happy better half!!
B002AQ4CV0|4|I like these pants because they are 100% cotton, don't wrinkle and have a slightly formal look because of the pleates. I am disappointed that the button and clip closure has been changed to a button only. I find that the button needs to be sewn on again about every 3 months, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.
B00EONSCKO|5|Love love love this blazer! Colors are beautiful, light fabric with a little stretch. Not for a cool Fall night but for a cool summers night. It is however made a bit small so I would suggest ordering 1 size up. Overall this jacket is beautiful.
B00J7AWF5M|5|The shipping was really fast. like 10 days from China to USA. I bought this dress on size M even when i am S. it fits good but i still have to fix the waist area because i have a tinny waist and i like the dresses to fit me tight. Excellent sellers. thank you.
B00FY46RUY|4|fit as expected
B00DZX5YYG|5|Super comfy and great quality!  Would definitely recommend.  If you are over 6 foot it is a bit small, but still wearable.
B006SRSYGG|4|I've worn and washed this a few times and haven't noticed any quality issues. The fabric is a thick two-layer weave, it is both stretchy and comfortable. The fit is good - a bit small, which is fine since it works well as a base layer. The sleeves are a little short. The seam stitching is rather prominent, but that's probably due to the fabric itself being thick. I haven't noticed any of the unraveling that another reviewer noticed, but it's still relatively new. It does say machine wash cold, tumble dry low, use no softener, so be careful about that. If I have any problems I'll update this but so far it's good.
B00CXLGIAK|5|I love this bra! It fits perfect. Its beautiful. Good quality stitching. Holds shape after going through the washer and dryer.
B00DKSVPP8|5|Fits me perfect but I bought a size above my normal because they do run small for Americans. Looks perfect, get tons of compliments and love the styles this company creates. Most certainly will be buying more products from this provider.
B003736ZQK|5|Excellent!!!!
B00BPNFPMY|4|My top is a 34D and I normally wear a medium bottom. I ordered a large based in other reviews that the swimsuit runs small. The large fit great. The turquoise color was pretty and the fabric was nice.
B009TQ70RW|4|I love Tripp pants! They always have neat designs and colors they combine together. The only thing is the quality does wear down pretty quick for how expensive they are
B00DY39MZE|5|Great quality.
B0036TUSJA|5|These pairs of Men's underwear are quite nice. The elastic waist is great because normal boxers have a weaker band that tends to allow the underwear to ride up but this elastic band is of good quality. I recommend this product to every man but make sure you get the right size. I would even buy one size too small just to make sure you get a good fit. They wear loosely so you don't have to worry about crowding your...well...you know. They breathe nicely and the material seems to be of good quality. Definitely a recommended product.
B00H2CZ9N2|1|I didn't know Dupion Silk is NOT natural silk, it was just a kind of synthetic material. The saree looks like a bad table cloth... I think people can't even use this as table cloth... it's too thin and just look so bad taste.<br /><br />I also bought other pink saree listed &#34;RAW SILK&#34;, it was Polyester.... Maybe Poly-Silk....<br />I hope after my complain about description of material they will describe exact material and % of what are they made of...
B0032FPQBS|5|Perfect for a small shirt, I'm 5&#34;4 and a little bulky as in muscular.<br />It goes well with any outfit, jeans or shorts
B001OAMTQI|3|It's okay!
B007WA4CZK|5|I actually love this dress. Even though it's a bit short but that's the fashion for this dress. Without the white belt the dress doesn't look appealing as much. This dress is fine, just like the image. I just need an accessory like that flower necklace then it'll be perfect. Pretty cute pleasant dress, RECOMMEND.
B00DGYD6YY|4|This clip is super cute. It may gets four stars because the rhinestone in the middle is a bit more obvious and gaudy than it looks in the pictures. The clip doesn't grip super tight, but it's comfortable to wear. Makes my Brown's Jersey a bit more girly.
B00UYY4KSK|4|Like really like the it. Thanks for all reviews. They help making decision accurately.
B0000APKTE|3|The cashmere is good, but the fit is a little off. A little to short in the arms with a bigger than necessary circumference. Good price for cashmere though and could be blocked to fit better.
B0068EB1AA|5|I'm over 6ft tall, weigh 220lbs, muscular with long arms. I ordered the XXL (XL-US) and the sweater fits perfectly on me. I'm very happy with this purchase. Follow the size guidelines and you should be alright. Hope this helps.
B00B0AYWIU|3|I will have to send this back even though it is very pretty and the fabric is silky feeling and doesn't show wrinkles, it is way too big, closer to a 3x than an extra large.
B005S6ALJQ|5|Beautiful!! Perfect fit!!
B00CP20C0E|4|Works well with my jeans. Just what I was looking for.
B00V63AEOM|5|great
B005JA8LZW|1|I only bought these socks because the description states that they are 68% Cotton/19% Polyester/10% Nylon/3% Spandex. On the package that I received it's written: 73% Acrylic/24% Polyester/2% Spandex/1% Nylon.  It is so frustrating!!!  It is so hard to find cotton socks. And I thought I did.
B003034A1Y|5|My husband loves it
B00X8WLDBC|5|Nice light weight fabric! Perfect for dressing up a summer outfit without making me hot.
B001PU9A9Q|4|I purchased my first pair only to find they smelled absolutely disgusting like cigarette smoke and garbage.  They refunded me and I ordered a new pair.<br />Well, the second pair has been fantastic!  You can still kind of see the outline of the nippies through certain kinds of shirts, but overall they are wonderful and stay on without any issue whatsoever until I take them off.  They aren't completely opaque, so keep that in mind if you're wearing something light colored.  I wish I could just live in these.  So comfortable.
B00G0Q0GOI|4|The top a little big but over all awsome
B00HRUWMFC|4|The color on this was beautiful! I really wished I could have kept it, the piece itself is large enough to fit a variety of sizes, because you adjust it with the strings, however, I am a large DD breast, and when I tied it to the snugness I wanted it to fit, the strings that are supposed to be under your breasts were on the middle of mine, when wearing it with a swimsuit, and that ends up being not flattering.
B00KRDOTK2|4|nice bra
B00PFSXFZY|3|It's a nice scarf but I purchased for my sister who just had a double mastectomy (with no reconstruction) so I wanted a longer scarf to cover her chest.  This was way too short so I returned.
B00GWEUO9K|4|After unsuccessfully shopping for a modest and affordable prom gown, my daughter found this one and decided to order it in the light teal.  We ordered the smallest size they had--a size 0.  We emailed them first with the date we needed it by. We were assured it would come in plenty of time, so we ordered it. It arrived very quickly and was lovely.  I removed some of  the boning and built in bra to make it more comfortable and fit my tiny daughter more naturally. Some of the sequins fell off and the quality of the sewing was not as good as the gown we purchased from another Chinese company for her twin sister. All in all, however, she looked lovely and the price was definitely right.
B00AOCX43Y|5|Love this shirt.  It's great quality for the price!
B0087J5E1G|4|The shirt came on time... in just two days.  I had it on time for my grandson's birthday two days later!
B00MO325PY|5|Love it!
B00N1DSQTK|1|when it came it had a hole in the leg
B008LWR7HS|5|These are the best khaki pants I've bought.  The tall length is perfect for 5'9 and curvy with a waist that comes high enough to not create bumps where they don't exist.  The fabric has enough give to provide easy movement but isn't to thin.  I've already ordered more.  Dickies is now one of my favorite brands for casual pants.
B00913JHNS|5|Nice and sleek . Seller did speedy shipping . The fabric is soft and you wont get too hot .
B000UUUQE0|1|Many pet owner networks via Facebook and MySpace have raised awareness of this item and Amazon's support of it. We're hopeful that the widespread protest and boycotting of Amazon will encourage them to remove the shirt from the site. Dogfighting is both illegal and inhumane, and any company that supports it should not be rewarded with our business.
B00US71356|3|It's super cute but runs small I'm an 6-8 so I ordered that size and it's too small.
B004XAEVEE|4|Fit and performed as expected. Good quality. I probably paid more than I had to because of the brand name, but that's the way things go I guess. Not let down in the least. Recommended.
B004ARPK2C|5|I was pleasantly surprised as to the fit of the pants on my tiny 18months old. She got a lot of compliments. I really love the shape. It's also holding on pretty well. I intend buying more.
B00PKVNPAQ|5|Omg, i love it...,iam not expecting how good it is in a cheap price. I can recommend it to everyone. .......
B00B55MCWI|4|I really like this shrug, its very pretty and fits nice. I am giving it 4 stars due to price. I found the same shrug for 17.99 after buying two of these in different colors for 40.00.
B0031U0PII|1|Color much darker than illustrated and not pleasing.  I previously purchased this belt from a local store and was the color illustrated. That previous belt was also of much higher quality.  I will not buy clothes from the internet again after this experience.  The store where I purchased this belt no longer had this belt so I purchased it from Amazon because they have always been wonderful.  I look forward to continue purchasing from Amazon everything but clothes.
B00775MMQ6|5|Love this! Fit perfect
B00OKQUY4W|5|Finally I have my daughter wearing a hat to school every day!  Product is soft and comfortable to wear.  Definitely a quality product which makes me feel good about spending a bit more than I had planned.  Worth the upgrade!
B00S1VTQEQ|4|A little small but I love it
B008N24IU0|5|Perfect for what it is intended.  Will spruce it up with flowers and it will be a derby day hat.
B0084XTRRM|1|Nice jacket but the sizing is out by miles. My son is 9 and the 10-12 wouldn't go near him. I think a size 14 would fit but then the arms would be too long. Really disappointing
B00CC7FYDW|4|Runs a little small for size but worked out good
B005CSOFC4|5|I love the shape and cut of this hoodie! If you are looking for something a little more roomy, order a size up. Super soft inside and good quality stitching.
B005L3KI9Y|1|These gloves have ripped within 2 weeks of giving them as a present. The stichting has started to come undone, and they are ripping apart. I will not buy this brand again.
B00FEZY5M0|2|I have extremely small shoulders and this did not go off the shoulder like pictured here. I ordered the size 2, so maybe if someone went up in size it might work. I didn't like the fit enough to make up for it not going off shoulder. Fabric was a dark gray and fairly soft
B0034G65F6|5|excelente
B00IB6ROHW|5|good quality
B008J1NXME|2|I would not purchase this brand again.  The material and stitching is rather cheap looking.  Sorry, but the color was perfect for the baby shower.
B00S5SULWG|5|Good quality its cute
B00NHQKRQG|2|Cheap fabric, both in feel and appearance. Meant to be worn as sweat pants more than with heels, as depicted. The white and black isn't true to color, either. The black is fine, but the white is actually yellowed and unattractive.
B00DJ1E4CM|3|Too small, the size was really small. I did not expect the sizing to be that much smaller than a regular sized shirt.
B00A9U6XAW|5|This was a great Christmas gift for my boyfriend, and one of the few that I could find that had a nice pattern and was self tie! Usually bows are clip on, but I was happy that I could find this, and the cuff links were a nice addition too, reasonable price for a great product.
B008CD5ONK|5|Definitely a great coat and would recommend to anyone. The only problem I ran into was they offer large sizes and nothing under large.
B009DJCS7C|5|I love these. I shared one with my 85 year old friend who was complaining about the fasteners in the backs of bras. They are very stretchy and she had no trouble getting them over her head. So she was delighted as well. Now I will have to order more.
B00JY7D4KS|5|As expected!  A+
B005XLTIQI|5|love love love! These are the second pair I've owned!
B000KI86Q2|5|Wow, I finally found a leotard that the sleeves actually reach my wrists.  I make several costume changes on stage and the fit must be smooth with enough length in the body and arms to facilitate the quick change.  Have many pair of leotards, but these are my favorites! Capezio makes a quality product, but somehow could only find this product available at Amazon.
B00H8HVSXQ|1|Wasted my MONEY!!!!!!!! Very upset about this !!!!! DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT IT IS A COMPLETE WASTE of time!!!!!!!!
B0071AXRMK|4|its too thin but still a nice belt, nice leather made and looks really good for the price is a good choice
B003PBZ8SU|3|They did not have a good shape, they looked boxey when on. It was difficult to get the insecticide smell out of them. They need to be washed twice before wearing. I would not buy another pair.
B00L3I34NS|5|Great item for my daughter
B00004U3SU|5|These were perfect for my western theme golf outing.  They fit perfectly over my golf shoes and everyone who saw them raved about how great they were and where can they get some!
B00KHII2K0|5|I love this!!! I agree with other reviewers that said the nursing slits don't cover their larger breasts but I always have a nursing tank on so it doesn't bother me. I'm short and it's just below my knee which is nice but I'd be happier if it was a little shorter. The quality is excellent!
B00PNIHA16|5|I love it
B00PBFZ6OY|4|Easy to get in and out , gut very well.
B003B83G36|2|Because it is a front closure, you cannot adjust the back size.  The same is true of the shoulder straps-no adjustment possible.  The cut of the bra was nice but it was described as being a soft cup and was definitely a foam cup to the bra.  I do not like the molded cups in bras.
B00BZQ7BVE|2|Fit WAY too small, and it was super short (unable to be tucked in).
B00GTDFQBK|5|Pretty cool :)
B00JHQKJSQ|3|Too small, Medium is a better fit
B00DB2911I|4|A comfortable everyday bra with good support and nice shoulder straps that don't cut in... I have three in different colors!
B007IVUECI|5|This product stayed true to size while undergoing the same pre-swim treatment as the half-sleeve top I commented on earlier. Love 'em!
B000V5PN56|5|First pair I have exert owned.  Glad I read the post about ordering one size larger in waste and correct length.
B0044VRS88|5|My husband LOVES this tie chain. He lost all the others because they fell off the button. This one fit the button perfectly. Great item, and so glad we bought it!
B001G1K7W8|5|Tried this bra on at Pea in the Pod and it was double the price. It is cute and very functional for a nursing bra. Gave me great support.
B00ISPPYUK|5|Bought this t-shirt as a birthday gift for a friend and she has been wearing often. Very happy with my purchase.
B00257HIZ6|5|did well with the iron
B007SY3GYI|1|They make me look like I have a baby bump and sit to high up around your tummy. for people who are short or like things to sit on there hips don't bother with this style pants. It's ment for long legs and completely flat tummys
B00GRLVVRW|5|Just got the tunics, in plum and charcoal. They fit me great (XL), the materials is nice and I love the neck cut. I'm probably gonna get a couple more in 1X or 2X, just because I would not mind them being even bigger, but I will keep the ones I got too.
B00F9RZ4SC|4|my daughter loves the cool leopard spots...wish I would have ordered a size larger so it would last her longer
B004M6XUI2|3|This wallet is low quality bonded leather (little bits of leather glued together and printed to look like it has leather grain.  Because of this, the wallet has an awful chemical smell and a gross slippery feel to it.  I can't understand for the life of me why this wallet is rated so well on here.  It is well enough built, and find the price fair, but not good.  I would rather pay twice as much and get a much better constructed Docker's or equivalent store brand wallet which doesn't make me gag from the smell of VOCs.  As I said, the wallet is fine, but not great.  It could be a lot better materials, but the price is fair, so 3 stars.
B00E5PW81A|5|Very cute and nostalgic! I love the way it fits, true to size!
B003M2Y6N0|5|I've never owned a pair of jeans that make my legs look as long and slim as these jeans do. When I tried them on for the first time, I did one of those little squeals of excitement and have since purchased them in a few different washes. Because of the steep price, I watch for sales, offered both here on Amazon and on the 7FAM website.<br /><br />The Rinsed Indigo wash is a dark blue without the 'worn' look of many jeans, which makes it look a bit more on the dressier side than many other washes. Stitching is gold.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Incredibly comfortable.<br />- Long inseam - yeah!<br />- Lightweight denim keeps these jeans from being too warm on all but the hottest summer days.<br />- 2% stretch - yeah again!<br />- Great cut is slimmer through the thigh than most of the other jeans I've checked out and flare at a lower point on the leg. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this cut.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Price. As I mentioned above, I keep my eyes open for sales and have saved a lot by shopping wisely.<br />- Somewhat limited wash selection. I'd like to see 7 offer a few more choices.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B009ZQ3Y4Y|5|I am usually skeptical of buying clothes online because they always seem to fit the person in the picture better than they do me. However, due to the positive reviews, I did order this shirt and I am not disappointed!! It fits exactly as it should, right to size and is adorable. The shipping was way quicker than I thought which was a great bonus! Love it!
B0017QDLPC|4|This is the most friendly looking Rabbit Costume I have every run across.  The costume will fit a tall person which is nice, the children enjoyed hunting eggs with the bunny.  Would definitely recommend it!
B002OOS5D4|5|I bought this for my brother-in-law and he absolutely loves it. He's worn it a lot since I got it for him.
B00G2VM0SG|5|My husband absolutely love ELO and was stunned I had found this when I gave it to him for Christmas. He wears it all the time. It fits well and washes up nicely so far.
B00ECH1GEG|5|Great tote!  It is very well made and sturdy!  Love, love, love this bag!
B005FPD2A0|1|I bought these as a Christmas gift for my wife who uses an iPhone and iPad often but whose hands are always cold in the winter.  She used it for only a week -- just to have when taking walks outside, etc., nothing that would put them under stress like shoveling snow or lifting things.  Even so, after only a week of use one of them is starting to come apart at the seam.  I picked them based on the brand and reviews.  But it seems like they are made very cheaply.  On the plus side for the week until they ripped they did work well for using touch devices with gloves on.  She said they were not particularly warm, but better than nothing.
B000FBBU44|5|Great bra, fits great and comfortable. It looks great under clothes and sits low so you can wear tops that hang a bit lower. It is my favorite!
B00BGMRODC|5|Nice fitting bermuda shorts for young men!  After purchasing one pair we bought three more pair!<br />They wash and wear very well.
B00FVXDFBW|3|tight around the bust area and is higher cut than expected in the neckline area.
B00LI281NW|1|Doesn't look anything close to the picture. And is a size bigger
B00IQIB23W|5|Such a cute outfit and the fit is great. My daughter is 4 months old and it's not too big that she's swimming in it, but there's still room for her to grow and it'll still fit her in another couple of months.
B005GW6I94|5|They fit so well and the material is great. I thought the fit was true to size and I was really happy about that.
B00IE0ZMU6|5|Love the way I feel in this. Casual or dressy which is nice. Good length with leggings
B000P55R2Q|3|its a t shirt
B00EVTQVNQ|2|Not good enough as expected
B008FV74N2|3|Says fits to a 3x but I'd say more like a generous xl or xxl. Can be stretched out when wet after washing. Hoping will soften up in time. Nice length just above knees. Neck opening isn't very big- if that matters to you.
B00BCXLO4K|1|I don't think the product was sized correctly. It stated an x-large but certainly doesn't appear to be;not from other x-large shirts anyways. This is for my son and I have to be very careful not to wash in machine so it will not shrink
B00B6E8POM|1|Came in pieces
B004XBTD6E|4|Gave a couple pairs of these as a gift. They were well made for the price.
B000OQ5EVA|4|A little big for the size.
B00R7N5VE8|4|This is a nice convertible bra.  It is very easy to attach or remove the straps to convert it between a strapless and regular bra.  It is a nice neutral color so won't be obvious under light clothing.  It appears well-made.  It is full coverage and has three fasteners.<br /><br />The cup size was accurate for me.  The two negatives to this bra were the fact that the top of the cups are kind of bulky and do not sit perfectly flush with your skin so it can be noticeable under a tight top.  Also, I found the band to be a bit tight.  However, I have noticed that to be the case with every strapless bra I have tried.  But if a tight bra will bother you, you might want to go up one band size.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice basic convertible bra.  Its not super attractive but it does the job.  It is slightly tight and the top is a tad bulky, but other than that, it is a nice bra and I like it.
B00D43GENC|4|great fit and material.
B00AKFPOZQ|5|This is the softest cloak you will ever have. It has whiskers too! I bought this for my friend, and I regret giving it to her because I am now cold and cloak less!
B007IRM1NM|5|Perfect fit.
B0080PNMUC|5|I bought this for my grand daughter and she loves it. It's well made and I'm sure it will be suitable to pass on to the next one in line.
B00O2C7M3A|5|Nice quality shirt
B00FBQNK82|4|Super cute tank - funky smell out of the package. Washed it wrong side out and it's good to go
B00CBAOH10|5|Excellent!
B005KGL1H0|1|Sizes are not true and the size chart is inaccurate. Stitching under armpit was coming undone. Poor quality item that looks like it has an adult body with children's arms. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!
B00RUE45K0|3|Run somewhat small. Not the most comfortable I've ever owned. :(
B00ANO8INY|4|the purchase was fulfilled by 100%, everything turned out as expected and as always happens in this website, all perfect forever.
B00EYNEWXK|5|Really cute and very cool for summer wear.
B002R0F9V6|5|Girls' leotards can be expensive -- and ugly. This classic Capezio is the one my daughter selected, but I am so pleased with the quality and look of the item, I probably would have chosen it myself. Basic is beautiful! We love this elegant little leotard, which also washes well.
B00DYNTZQ0|4|This is really nice! Super cute, but the jacket was a bit small in the arms, and the cuffs were pretty tight, which my son did not like, but overall the set is really nice, super cute color and warm. Thats what matters!
B00KOH2A52|5|My girl is totally happy with this gift
B004M6UDC8|5|dope af
B000DZA4KI|5|Its really a good stuff,arrive on time.i'd rather recommend this to a friend.Im using it right now and my friends notice it.I might order another for giveaways.so keep up for a good quality and service.
B00UR86VJO|5|Fit perfectly...
B0095UYC78|5|I ordered four of these onesie's for me and my daughters and we all love them.  Use the chart, it's a very accurate indicator of sizes.
B00CZ6NB5S|2|not worth the money
B00EH57M8M|5|Fit great, I will be getting more of these for sure.
B003MZ012C|5|these are great for someone who doesn't want jiggly boobs. I am a DD so I like people to see me not my boos and this bra does the trick
B00GKCB4CU|2|It was ok, just not for me.
B00GNLA1DQ|5|Love my purse
B00ACIGUBI|5|Changed my life
B00GLQ4300|5|I Got this top today, and it is the cutest top ever!! I love it, it does have a weird smell but it is not too bad, it looks fun and cute! Love the kitty in the front,
B0067VMXQK|5|I purchased these with the Lauren Madison baby boy Baptism infant Shantung outfit.  And it made a statement - elegance, simply elegance.
B003R7LD5Y|4|These socks are very cozy and warm, but they are quite bulky. I ended up having a bit more bulk in my shoe than I really wanted.
B008J7DCDI|5|great product
B004070PIG|3|these were a gift for the wife, so i was so happy they got here, on time, and at a reasonable price. so absolutely no complaints there. but they're \\"one size.\\" so's the wife, but i will just say she is perfectly sized... 6 ft tall, medium build, certainly not sasqwatchian proportions but taller and curvy. well, not only did these shrimpy leg warmers not measure up in size but they had the exact opposite of the desired effect. call me a weirdo but these were for \\"fun.\\" but because they did not rise above the knee due to their tightness, they ended up fitting like socks, or at least sock tops. soon, my friends, they just felt like socks.... strange, excessively hairy socks. then, just like my wife's excessively hairy calves, unable to climb her brock lesnar-like knees. at least that is the way she felt. the lesnar part, i mean. the hairy calves, well, that's just the feeling i came away with. i wanted, i guess, a variation on the ol' woolen stockings, or whatever, but not the illusion that my wife has mega-, (beauty and the)beast-like hairy calves. creepy. but if that's your thing, and there are websites devoted to it, these are perfect, nice quality, and seem warm.
B003LO1X9E|5|I've been wearing these pants for over ten years and have never been dissapointed in their fit, price or the way they wash up.
B000A3I3OM|5|On the chest and the length of the arms it fits like I expected because the waist is big because I'm smaller around the waist but the chest I'm big and I'm tall also so the jacket is like the other jacket I had years ago it the same way and it fits the same just like I like it.
B00TO9UE90|3|Good
B001MWAM6W|3|It fits just like it should, but too bad it was out of the bag and had a blue pen ink spot on it.
B0033PS59W|3|The photo used in the search results has a different color. Everything else is fine.
B00L216FCS|1|Horrinly misleading,not a dress more like a t shiry for my 6 yr old literally
B002IAX7BO|4|The costume served it's purpose for my son at a fun wild west party. He did get compliments, although he chose to wear black jeans and black dress shoes over the simple pull on pants and the mock boots. The garment bag it arrived in was so cheap! The zipper broke the first try at opening the bag.
B0089SX6U6|5|excelente
B00JH2CYLU|5|Great!
B00GH7DISQ|3|i would have liked the material they made out of mine darker because they used a light brown material instead...
B00EO49FYA|5|Made beautifully, very comfortable, love it!
B00T4P52IC|5|Great dress!  Flattering and comfortable, and machine washable.  Wore it to a bridal shower.  Very pleased!
B00H3YURPY|5|Great Quality. I am 5'7&#34; tall and 152 Lbs and ordered these pants in an XLarge size base on the reviews. However, the XLarge size was way to big for me. I kept it and gave it to my daughter who is well endowed in her back size and thighs. It fitted her beautifully. I ordered a second pair for myself in a Medium size and words can not describe how nice this pants fit and brings out my natural curve. Just love it!
B00IDHI8S8|3|Nice quality, structure, fabric, etc. However, I went thru 2 sizes and both didn't fit. I ended up returning both, I'm not going to purchase a 3rd time. Realize now that this is something that needs to be tried on in store before purchase.
B0079MFZJI|5|It fits like it should.
B009P90O5I|5|Bought the shirt for my husband we're both really big black ops fans and it met all our expectations. Thanks
B00960SY8K|5|Rainbow dress for a girl who loves rainbows
B008ALO5Z2|5|I love it. I'm going to get some in every color they have. Love the way it fits and looks. It doesn't dig into me and was just perfect
B0078Z0SXE|5|This petticoat was the perfect knee-length for me (I am 5'1'').  It was also the perfect fullness... not too poofy.
B001UJ7YYA|2|This product did not do what it was supposed to. I wore it and it did not make my stomach seem slimmer at all. Would not recommend this to anyone!
B00QJ03SWW|5|Fits great looks good on me
B002WQP3MK|3|This robe is a great price.  I wanted a lightweight robe lined with terry cloth.  This has no terry cloth inside but is ok without it.  There was a lot of shrinkage when I washed it making it much smaller which was ok for me. The belt frayed and looks quite sad after the washing.  The sleeves are so short now that I feel a chill on my arms. All in all though you can't beat the price.  Would really be a bargain if the shipping wasn't so darn high!
B007HJFIO0|5|This bra fits very well, the cups are a natural shape, the lace is soft and comfortable, the clasp is sturdy and it's pretty. My only issue is that they don't make it in black! A few more jewel tones would be great, Glamorise!!
B004DQEX2S|2|A little large to me, and it's look like plastics, not so warm as I expected before.the zipper is ugly,too.
B00CZE8Z9M|5|Love it!
B00T3J0E3M|5|This is a beautiful dress.  Love the material, the length was perfect great quality.
B00HSATAY2|5|I was going to make it but it was cheaper to buy and it was real nice and saved me a lot of work.
B005NKRWFS|3|Beautiful color and fabric. Not as big as I thought and would of loved to have handles in side or an area for arms to wrape the cap when walking. Hood is big but works well
B00GM07XBG|5|Great style and comfort!
B00JKQAI84|5|These are the only socks I purchase.  They keep coming up with styles that are unique.  The style alone is worth the money but they are extremely comfortable and I haven't wore a pair out yet.  I highly recommend.
B00EIQLRW2|5|It was a Christmas gift and she loved it.
B00CKASJA6|5|Great-loved it.
B0081TW29Y|4|good material but smaller than I would like
B00MVHWDIC|5|I had ordered an Ann Cherry waist trainer before and ordered this one in a smaller size. It gave me the perfect shape and does its job. I wouldn't recommend wearing it more than 8 hrs a day as it can start to get uncomfortable. The shipping was fast as well. I received my order in two days and did not have to pay extra.
B00NHQI16E|2|But it doesn't fit. The material has no give, so both my chest is uncomfortably constrained, and my shoulders can't move (I admit to having the shoulder build of a robust football player). I needed help zipping up the dress because I couldn't move my arms much once in it. I guess part of it is on me for not going with the customized measurements of every body part, and just trusting to the generic size. I highly recommend against that.
B00CXABJZK|5|Loved the swimsuit but did not quite fit.  The next size was unavailable so I returned the item.  Purchased the same style,it in a different print.  Fits great.  Great quality and would recommend it.
B00FDMURWQ|1|Only one star because it came stained. There were 2 dark stains(circles) to the side of the buttons on the bottoms. Also it took forever to arrive.
B006FZQDM8|4|First, the price is good, and the quality is OK. But, when I try to wear them, I found they are not flexible. If you have fat feet, I believe you will have a hard time when you try to put them on.
B00NKBCQLM|1|i order size 27 and they do not fit they run small and i need a size 28 i took it for granted that they would fit and they dont not happy i wanted to exhange them but i am a little late so they say an exception to change would be nice
B009325EM0|5|Looks good. My opinion is its a bit too expensive for what you're getting
B00L4GWGA6|5|I was worried about one size because I usually wear juniors size 3 or 5.  Most of the clothes &#34;one size&#34; are too big for me but this one fits perfectly.  Very nice casual dress.
B00I3LSRT4|5|Love this bag. Looks better the more I use it too. I do wish the back kept its dull look, as it got darker and shiny over time after rubbing against my back. But, I guess that's the nature of saddle leather.
B007L6IDL4|5|Material is a little thin, but perfect for Florida's weather!
B00FR6AYS0|2|Doesn't fit well, and is very cheap looking.<br />I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.<br />Took a very long time to arrive at my residence
B00J16UX38|5|It's Lightweight, has a nice fit, it's a nice length, good price.  I would definitely buy one of these items again.
B00E0OT09O|5|thanks
B00E4I4UAA|5|Love them.  Perfect fit and quite thick and comfy.  will be decent for the cold months coming up.
B008Q0E61U|5|You are getting eight clips for the price of one; the quality is good and the assortment is nice.  The only caution is that if you have extremely narrow ties these will be too wide for you.
B004FUOIC2|5|I purchased this jacket as a birthday present for my son.  He loves it and I have not had any complaints as of yet in reference to the quality, washing, etc. Great jacket for young men.  Very stylish.
B005SJIRUS|5|Nothing bad to say about this little guy, stylish and the most functional wallet I've ever had, may buy another one.
B00LG10XRC|4|very happy. Thank you
B00K32YSOO|1|Way to small for a &#34;plus size&#34;. Gave it to my younger sister who is a smaller woman than me and can fit it better.
B006W5W82A|2|I am a big fan of three dots, but disappointed with this one. Cut didn't flatter me, fabric was too shiny.
B00B4EPMWC|5|Did not know Vince Camuto make clothes for plus size beautiful! I have a designer clothes!!! Do more for plus size we love you!!
B00F9T58YA|5|These fit great and are very comfy. The length is just right (I am 5'7&#34;).  I am going to buy another pair as I have a hard time finding shorts that fit well ( I have a very small waist and larger hips, these sit right on the hips without sagging).
B008CL1IZA|5|I am very happy with the purchase very good recommend the product and a good price. I hope to buy again thanks
B000TA1SGQ|4|Would like more cushion in the heels otherwise great
B007GCOFDI|2|Bought as a gift for my wife. She said the fabric was soft, but didn't like the way it fit. She said the size was appropriate, but felt heavy and didn't like the shape.
B003G30WX8|1|After wearing twice the rear seam ripped opened. I have owned Dockers in the past and never had this problem. Dockers quality appears to be declining; not sure if they have the appropriate quality controls in place within their factories. Terrible purchase: Will switch brands.
B0077RZZHW|5|nice shirt, i brought it for my father
B0031U0P2O|5|This is a high quality leather belt at a good price. Buckle is attached with snaps and can be replaced easily.
B006VIH55S|5|Teenage son loved it!
B00HQ9XNJ8|4|Good!
B00FEDTWQ6|4|The coat looks very nice. It ia a bit snug in the chest. Too expensive to return, so keeping it.
B00A4EHHKS|5|This tee shirt fit my daughter great.  It is fuller in the middle- a perfect fit for her.<br />Thank you!
B008P8N0FQ|5|I wear a size 12/14 and have a 40 inch bust. The XL fits perfectly.
B003E1E2VA|5|The shirt is amazing but the sizes are a bit bigger than expected. The Large felt more like an XL for me, so I gave it to my brother. I ordered a 2nd shirt, this time I ordered a Medium shirt, and perfection! Great colors, very comfortable. The shirt doesn't feel cheap. great buy...twice :/
B0081FYZ2U|5|I've had a gray pair of these for about 15 years.  I wear them when it's hot instead of shorts.  They are light and loose.  I got paint on them or I wouldn't have needed to buy more.  Blue is perfectly fine but gray SEEMS cooler.  They are way big on me but that is the way I like them.  I like 100% cotton for coolness too.  It is odd that different colors and sizes are made of different material and are different prices.  All in all, these are great.
