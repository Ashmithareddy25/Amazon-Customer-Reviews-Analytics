B009DJWJMQ|5|Perfect fit. Works great
B000C55SVE|5|Good price. And excellent time on shipping, get 5 stars from me
B00RB9SBS6|5|They move around a bit so I added a couple of Velcro strips and that keeps them in place.  Now they work perfectly.
B00OZ6S7BY|4|Its a drain plug for my Subaru.  I much more I can state about it other then it fit and there was no leaking oil.  There was no leaking oil on the prior one as well but I like how this felt as I tighter it.
B00KPWBBLA|1|I really don't understand how people can give this more than one start when countless people complain about these not fitting/lining up. I had the same issue as many others. One side barely lined up with the holes after literally having to kick it into place. For the other side, there was no shot of it bolting up. I had to drill into two spots on the rails to extend the holes and make it possible for them just to bolt up. Even with all 3 8mm bolts in place, the rest still didn't line up with the body.  The middle portion of the rail does not line up and as a result, I couldn't get the bolts to go through to catch it onto the body.<br />It took me hours to install these because of poor fittment and all the drilling. In comparison, it took me 20 minutes to install the Mopar Rock Rails.
B000BUOSGG|4|Works fine. Does what I want it to do.
B004KKDNNM|2|this is a cheap value.  There are stronger ones out there and, given the process of replacing, well worth the additional cost to get the &#34;duck billed&#34; type  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FBKUEY?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00
B00C4B1F7U|3|It didn't fit the holes. One of the flanges looks bent. Guess either was damaged during shipping as it came with zero cushion inside. Had to hammer both sides many times before it fit. After which took about 5 minutes. The product weighs a ton much more than my previous installation.
B000ALBZK8|5|Did not work at all with my project. Does not work on all plastics
B005OVPU64|5|Good Parts and they fit as needed
B0046IC24O|2|I replaced my fob because the original one would rarely work with the unlocking function and I had to be right at the car. Unfortunately, this one is acting very similarly to the one that was 12 years old. Perhaps there is an issue with the receiver on the car, but I'm a bit disappointed that this will often not work for unlocking when I'm standing at the tailgate. I have to walk toward the front of the vehicle. As I stated, I can't necessarily blame this device, but I'm very disappointed that it was not a better solution.
B009HU6OHC|5|Price was right, better quality then oem
B00DSNN9EK|5|works well
B000Q753B8|1|Don't waste your money. I never even took this out of the package, my bad, and when I opened it the other day the side that should be attached to the bag isn't even attached. I am unable to return due to it being past 30 days.
B004FQ5K6O|3|I have a Harley Sportster and added the RSD forkbrace a while back. This cap matches the cut out pattern in the fork brace and replaces the shiny silver stock cap on my black tank. I like the look, but DANG, their prices on the cosmetic stuff are HIGH. I mean, the fork brace is thick metal and adds function! The cap is just a vanity piece. It is nice and light, but... The RSD logo is actually a little STICKER that came in the box!<br />I'm sure it will work well and I like the look it completes on the bike.<br />So: 5* on style. 3* on construction and 1* on value = 3*
B00IJMA8Z8|5|Fits like a glove.
B001A1PPBM|5|Excelentes!!!
B00ZOOA5CK|5|Plug and play! Works great!
B00Q2DV2QU|5|Perfect for my Jeep key.
B008CFB5AO|4|god
B007HRGZDK|5|Works as advertised and made the trip much more quiet.  I am sure I will be buying a lot of this stuff.
B00EHHV2OU|5|Works as expected. Took a few tries to program but not too bad.
B001FCNIS8|5|Easy to put on Jeep grill.
B00WZ62TJW|5|It fit perfect,I used 4 1.75 in muffler clamps instead of the ones provided.
B00CC2ZU4K|5|It just works and has not failed me, this is my 6th 55w kit from OPT7 that I have used in 4 of my personal cars and 2 on my mom and dad's car. Only think I recommeded is that if you bright white light go with the 6000k, the 5000k still has a slight yellow to it.
B009GXX11M|5|Fix perfect
B00K1C1WC2|5|Good.
B001BAF50S|5|Excellent quality, well made, should last a long time.
B00NPZ44ZY|5|Great job.
B00C6OHG14|5|Excellent
B0001YW2HY|5|No problem!!
B000C5YCYS|5|easy to install and a perfect fit.
B007V2CN1O|5|Perfect for my 2010 F150 and now we just traded for a 2014 F150 and it fits that one even better.
B00N9U0C7E|5|I purchased 2 of these lights for illumination of a sign that we were unable to get power to. They have worked flawlessly for the last year. The mounting bracket is great because it allows for different methods of mounting without having to purchase extra hardware.
B00L6XZU0A|5|It did'nt have insttuctoons for my year car but alll I had to do was take it to a auto locksmith and it was literally working in minutes.The cost was a fraction of what the dealer wanted.
B00G9W9Q4Y|5|It just plainly works...
B0009NWQWI|5|This item I feel is one of the better things I'd ever bought. We called it our &#34;van backpack&#34;. I don't know how much weigh we put in it, but it took 3 adults to hold it up while being strapped in place. Although we could have loaded it up while it was in place, it was easier to get a nice even load while it sat on the ground. We didn't strap it under the van, instead we used the strap around the front and through the tailgate. Much easier.
B00J6EK6DM|5|Installed on a 2015 Dodge Challenger.  Good price, easy to install, weatherproof, does what it's supposed to do. Perfect.
B004QEM6OY|4|The first one of these I received was missing the pin and key (as others here have stated). I processed a return/replacement through Amazon and that went very smoothly. The next day I had another unit at my door when I got home from work and it included the pin and key. Amazon provided the return shipping label so I just dropped it in the mail room the next day and all was well.<br /><br />It's a nice, sturdy unit, exactly what I needed.
B006HY8DC0|5|Looooove it! :-)
B00COYNZJ8|5|LOVE THIS IN MY CAR.  HELPS WITH THE HEAT
B00029WYEY|4|Works great!
B00WNA0UXW|4|I would have given this unit a five star rating had it not been for the lack of comprehensive instructions.  At first being just a tinkerer I didn't know that the neutral was an integral part of the installation.  Eventually, after much consternation, I ran a 10-2 NM using the ground for the neutral and grounding the 14-50 receptacle with it's own outside ground (8' grounding rod).  It would be my suggestion to the manufacturer to include more detailed installation instructions and have a call line that is actually attended.  Otherwise the unit works fine now; it is well constructed.  For the record I have a '13 Volt that is the finest automobile I've ever owned and I've had many..
B000BLGPGQ|2|&#34; I,M TIRED OF WAISTING MY MONEY ON THESE SYLVANIA 9006 BULBS&#34; !! &#34;YES THEY ARE BRIGHTER THAN YOUR ORDINARY HALOGEN BULBS&#34; BUT I,M NOT HAPPY WITH A 20.00 HEADLIGHT BULB , BURNING OUT AFTER 6 MONTHS OF INSTALLATION .  THE ONGOING  RECURRING PROBLEM  WITH THEM , IS THEIR TENDENCY TO BURN OUT VERY PREMATURELY . EVEN IF YOU INSTALL THEM USING A SANITARY , OIL FREE , FINGERPRINT FREE ENVIRONMENT !!AND USING LATEX GLOVES , DURING INSTALLATION !!  I LIVE IN A SMALL TOWN & WE ONLY HAVE ONE AUTO PARTS STORE. I HAD NO REAL OTHER CHOICE !?.  IVE HAD 2 SETS BURN OUT VERY EARLY IN THEIR LIFE !!  I,M DONE WITH SYLVANIA  HEADLAMP BULBS , AND FLUSHING MONEY DOWN THE TOILET .  IVE BEEN USEING THE PHILLIPS BRAND NOW FOR TWO YEARS , WITH NO PREMATURE BURNOUTS .  AND THEY WERE A LIL CHEAPER ALSO !!  AND A BETTER , BRIGHTER LITE BEAM ALSO !!  LIVE & LEARN ..
B00FBXUQV4|5|Legitness
B00LM4OQMG|1|This holder leans forward AND drinks bounce out when you hit a bump. And it doesn't fit on the left side if you have a clutch.
B00PP6CEX0|4|This lock fits, and functions correctly in my jetta MK4, the materials used are not OEM quality but it is a quarter of the price so that is to be expected, the door does have a different sound now but I have had this in the car for about a month and have had no issues.
B0006H8PJ0|4|As a bulb they work as they should. So that's a positive. Install was a big pain. The rubber gasket was a tad to thick and I was unable to get the bulb to seat. So after I pulled them off and replaced the gasket with the older one from the burnt out light they fit like a dream. Just keep that in mind if you're having trouble.
B00NUDDU6A|5|no issues
B00LN3QPIY|5|Very bright, solid construction, I feel its a great light for the price. I bought 2, using them on my van as fog lights. Much better then what I had.
B00R59P70W|5|Perfect fit.  Arrived quickly.  Very helpful representative.
B004PGIJZ8|5|WORKS JUST LIKE I NEEDED IT TOO.
B00C1CH2EM|5|good roof rack like a original ones
B0009IBJAS|5|5 stars
B010CA65P6|5|I like the product
B004YK4S1O|5|as a little Touch of Class to your tires
B005F6SBJG|5|Easy to install.  Works well.  Right price.  What more can one ask for?
B000HBNVSK|5|A+
B00RZ4Z3GK|5|Same style switch that is at the local auto parts store for $10 for 1! Got 10 for just a few bucks more than what I would have paid for 1. Great switch, works as intended.
B000C4087Y|5|Looking good on my G35X 2005.
B00WY574YY|4|I debated purchasing this product from Advance Auto Parts as they are running a $10 rebate for this kit in the month of August. Sadly, there weren't many reviews available. I went ahead and bought it.<br /><br />The kit is fairly simple to use. It includes:<br /><br />1 foam device (used to attach pads and shine the light)<br />3 pads<br />scratch remover liquid<br />wax<br />auto masking tape<br /><br />I previously purchased the turtle wax headlight restoration liquid, but my headlights were entirely too cloudy for that to work. I turned to this product hoping it would do the trick. To my surprise, after about an hour of work, my headlight looks simply amazing. I have pictures to share, but apparently amazon no longer allows you to include pictures in your reviews (boo Amazon!). I only have one done as of now, but let's say you can easily tell which one has been \\"restored\\". For the price of $5, or the regular price of $15, I'd buy this again in a minute.<br /><br />There are a few things 3M could do to improve their product...<br /><br />Closable bags for wax and scratch remover. Mine leaked all over the place, which could have been avoided.<br />Better adhesive on velcro stuck to foam device- mine almost peeled off after removing the first disc. That would have made the whole kit pretty much useless.<br />Better labeling of pads- At first it was hard to tell which pad to use based on the directions. I finally figured it out, but a clear label would have been much easier.
B0093OWREQ|5|Nicely made, arrived quickly
B00KVZOKH8|3|Cheap material, decent shipping speed
B00X31XGHW|5|Great size! Beautiful once installed. 3 out of 4 were perfect size, needed to stretch one. But well worth it.
B00LLU7ALA|5|Super good. We use it on our water ski boat. When emerging from the water, the kids &#34;pre-towel&#34; with this. It absorbs so much water they are nearly dry after using it. That way, their regular towels stay mostly dry and warm instead of being soping wet, heavy and cold.
B000HEBR3I|5|Good
B00DR14U0K|4|fits perfectly, very nice replacement for the original.
B00VA0VPL2|3|We purchased two of these for our RV.  They are nice, but did not come with feet as described.  Without the bun feet, the foot of the bed when pulled out is higher than the head.  Amazon tried to contact manufacturer but could not.  They offered us a  &#34;refund&#34; but we have received no confirmation.  They also offered to let us return them, but the packaging was discarded, they are large, and we used them on our vacation.  We would not have kept the sofas if we had known the head of the bed was about four inches lower than the foot.  Lesson learned!
B00X4VXAH2|5|Excellent shield for price.
B0001EFSTI|1|Can never get it to open. Some guys have a couple times but it's very difficult. Broke several nails trying.
B007KPVBLK|5|Really nice bag - fits my Road King (almost) perfectly. Straps around stock seat are a tad bit short, but just make it.  Otherwise well made.
B00AB2PBU6|5|what a awesome look. The seat covers really add a classy touch to my seats.
B00F8PNUAY|1|Junk.  Failed within the first week.  Buyer beware.
B00CFALFXY|5|Very good cleaning cloths.
B00L8FLBVS|2|Don't look so good weak
B004940ZSK|5|Good
B00JRU9T5G|2|Seems to be made ot cheap materials USB port don't work I'd return if I could waste of money
B00YE5Q132|5|But I'm optimistic and I do prefer the storage convenience of this charger to another similarly configured charger I own. I doubt many are interested in a portable jump starter based on the other features it may have available (this one has an assortment of them); it's all about the capability to jump start a dead vehicle battery. That's not a situation I find myself in currently and in most respects I hope I don't have to find out although I also know that's not likely to be avoided.<br /><br />The jump starter is packaged in a compact hard shell case with ample room to house all provided accessories. The starter has fuse, overcharge and overdischarge protection with peak current of 400A with a front panel socket for attachment of 12V auto battery clamps.  The front panel also has a power button and a separate on/off switch; both required to operate the emergency flasher function and the side positioned flashlight.  The four front panel blue LED lamps indicate starter charge capacity.<br /><br />The kit comes with an AC power supply and a separate 12V adapter There is an output ports for 12/16/19V output (also controlled by sequential presses of the power button), a smart USB 2.0 5V max output, 12V port and input port for AC or 12V power adapters. A cable and an assortment of 8 connector sizes for different laptops/tablets are conveniently provided as well as another cable micro USB devices. Apple lightning devices will require an adapter or separate cable.  Full charge time is rated at 5 Hours and it is represented up to 20 jump starts can be provided from a single charge. Documentation indicates up to 1000 cycles can be completed. Operating range is between -10 to 60 degrees Celsius.  To conserve Lithium battery life, recharge every 4 months is recommended.<br /><br />I received a sample for evaluation.
B001447VH6|5|great!!!!!!!!!!!
B003FSIFWO|5|After buying this for my 2011 chevy silverado 5.3 v8 the change was instant. Extreme difference than the way it was with a stock intake. The engine got quite with idleing and when slight gas, it has a whistle to it and pedal to the metal it sounds throatier deeper and meaner. The milage is increasing and so far no problems. 110% recommend
B008X73TGY|3|Only giving 3 stars because the shipping took a little while, a week longer then the 3 other things I bought on amazon at the same time. Other then that, it's the exact size that I needed. Since it's being used outside, I'm hoping that it holds up. It's pretty sticky though so I imagine that it will.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Awesome sunshade. Great value, Highly recommended seller!
B004RH868U|5|Beautiful product. Does not need cleaning prior to install. Will buy again.
B00J8T2JSU|5|Love these wipers!
B000PWZR4C|5|Product was as described and was delivered on time.  Works great.
B000IG208G|5|cool little piece for a jeep. i like it
B00VT2JXP6|5|I got my light faster than it said i would and works great might get another one..!
B00UZ0OHIQ|1|just got it. All it does is beep. It tells me nothing about the engine. It does let me know where it is parked, how much distance between parking places. It gives some kind of estimate about gas expense but since there is no way to enter the price of gas purchased, it probably is not accurate. It says you can download apps that will give you engine info, but I tried several and none of them tell me anything about my car (Lexus RX350). There are cheaper devices that connect to the car so I am thinking about returning this (since it really doesn't do what it says it will do) and getting one of the other ones.
B005GOPT0G|5|Terrific replacements for my other vents that don't close! I replaced all my vents in my rv so that I could close them in one section and leave them open in the other, since some of us like AC and others don't! They can also help reduce the noise of the rushing are when closed. no screws included so you just have to use the ones from the old vents, but if you don't have old ones, you'll have to get your own screws. When closed they do not seal 100% of the air coming out, but almost!
B000I12S4W|4|Work well, fit my mac tester at less than a quarter of the price.
B00LHUI4XM|4|So far I am pleased with the frame. Here in North Carolina we will be ticketed if any part of the frame covers any information on the plate usually the portion on the bottom stamped North Carolina. This plates slim design allows the name to be clearly shown. For that reason four stars I'll need to wait to see how it weathers.
B00E3BQRBI|5|I'ts more than I expect
B000NCOKZQ|4|Just what I needed
B0001EWCPQ|5|wrong ones
B00JXBF318|5|Love it
B00TO4TGLC|2|The description had a &#34;Will this fit your car?&#34; feature, which told me this cover would fit on a 2013 Toyota Prius. It most definitely does not.
B005VOSSYA|4|Perfect fit. This panel does not come with the connecting fasteners. I was able to reuse the original bolts that were still connected to the vehicle.
B00VQL2P3W|5|Thank you
B00EUUNJRM|5|despite rumors that the bar allegedly has water problems mine has been thru monsoon type weather and ive never had any problems.its excellnt,very brighgt and an easy install.i highly recommend it .
B0073HDDLG|5|Good part, fast delivery.
B00RZWU8ZI|5|It was just what I needed and arrived quickly. Thx!
B00A6U2MR8|5|It scraped the ice off my car for months in the Indiana winter and allowed me to get to school/work.
B0031NJKAE|4|Good catch, but tends to tear up with use...the ring in the retainer wears and drops out.
B000GU24HG|1|Broken in 5 Days.(10-)
B00A9OCRN0|5|Very nice.  More than I expected.
B00407V6YI|5|perfect match
B001NZKPS8|5|Don't try to hard wire your brake controller if you have a GM with the tow package;  your truck is already set up for plug and play.  All you need is this adapter.
B00K2C8MVK|5|Excellent
B007OC9JGI|5|quality product
B003ULZGFU|5|It's great! Two in one tools
B00DBEPM6O|4|the lights function fine when hooked to a battery charger, but they will NOT light in my sportster at all.
B002ZS4QCS|2|Loved the idea of these, but I never used them for bags.  My husband laughed at my buying these &#34;gimmicky&#34; items, but I was tired of groceries rolling out of their bags in the back seat.  He was right - they get caught on everything and it's more work to use them than not.  My toddler was also always playing with them and they'd end up on the front of the seat for someone to lean against.
B00TABK6KO|5|It was right one. Looks good.
B00LM029HY|5|Thanks!!
B00U326Y2I|4|I thought that by the description it was going to be bigger, doesn't really hold much. But other than that I like the bags
B003O0Y0BI|5|Worked perfectly in fact I think better than the originals that came with the car
B005RNGL9O|5|Great at removing clear coat scratches when paired with a polish or two
B0016IJ3Z8|5|Good
B001SBAQYU|5|Quality USA made roof marker light for the Chevy trucks. Bought five for my 1969 C40 1-1/2 ton truck. You get the lens, rubber base, bulb and wire pigtail. The originals my truck had were the flat &#34;hockey puck&#34; style but were in bad and broken shape. These are the closest thing I could find to original and fit and worked perfect.
B00S9BIL9O|5|were perfect fit to replace broken mirrors that were original from factory. easy to install,
B013MKW2AU|5|Extremely good quality piece, kept contact throughout purchasing process, extremely fast shipping A+ would purchase again!
B00HQLD832|5|It looks awesome! Good quality. Just make sure when you put the caps on you put them centered because once you put them on they don't move.
B000C2SC4C|4|Nice fit.
B00GGQBIFI|1|i try this on two diferent motorcycles, a 150cc (Keeway RKS) and 200cc (Keeway Superlight), even with the regulator and still not notice the difference, may be little but not as espected.  However, it's drowning when i start from cero.  Had to put the original cdi again.
B00KTHXRLS|5|oh yea its the real deal. 2005 solara.
B009AVX0SO|5|great product worth money
B00VRPZHQ4|5|This is my favorite shift knob it was in good condition no chips on it the gold stands out and its came in the mail faster then it said it would and it went right on was hard to out on I love it
B002Y20VXS|5|Looks great, applies pretty easily. Delivery didn't take that long. Its been a few months and it is still on my car looking good
B00KTIUPPI|5|Good
B003YLMQ54|5|Perfect fit and quick delivery. Very satisfied.  Thank you...
B0022ZL4LK|5|Awesome Cover, really works well.
B00ACMF53S|5|Order was correct
B000F2RAEC|5|Looks very nice!
B001NQQ9WI|5|fun sticker
B0007VNZO0|5|Fit perfect!
B000HLUJ8K|5|Purring like a kitten with these spark plugs, on my 1999 XJ.
B00G2Q6J6K|4|1 ST WAS NO GOOD  SENT IT BACK AND THE 2ND ONE WAS FINE  SO FAR
B003EOXJ4S|2|Although it was VERY heavy metal, looked like it came with good hardware, etc ... I thought it would be textured, almost rough. Like it said... instead I got a picture of something textured, stuck on a heavy piece of metal. It is a smooth surface with shiny bits to make it look textured. Very disappointing ...  I returned.
B00OKYV7PE|5|Great fit, easy install. Took 1.5 hours while slacking
B00306YESK|3|gloves are a bit tight for their designated size.
B00IIT7Q2A|3|Ok
B00I266F4E|1|I liked it at first but by tha week it started to rip and well  i had put it on and went on vacation and well when i got back today there wasent anything i could do so i guess ill have to keep
B00DSD55HO|5|Love it!!!
B004OZIJ4Q|4|Nice... 4 stars because it said it will deliver Friday but it delivered Monday.
B005O25DN8|5|Easy to install and works great! Shipped really quick as well!
B00XULVDHK|5|love the shades!! And I don't even need the suctions. They<br />work just fine without them. I've tried many other shades and none have<br />worked! Best shades ever thank you!!
B00WWFIJB8|5|works great, a little bigger than expected...
B004K9EWLU|5|Still have to install it, but looks very good. My only complaint is that there is no description of the product nor photos for costumers to check it.
B005BNZ6WI|3|Ok product just wish it was made from a heavier material to stand on their own.
B00863MT3O|5|fast delivery, fit great. great price also.
B005KH6S3Q|1|This is a &#34;wind deflector&#34;, not a guard.  It is just thin plastic and provides no protection for your levers...as I discovered the first time my bike was dropped.  If you are looking for protection, look elsewhere-you can get real guards for the same or less money.
B002B4Y0F4|5|Gave this to a friend for her birthday. Probably the funniest gift I have ever given! Hysterical!
B0031BW7OC|5|I have used the cobra fat bars, the kuryakyn one, and the lindby for my vtx, this one works the way I want.  Because the bar is a rolled one piece, it's stronger than the lindby.  It sets hight than the cobra and the lindby, so you can lean further and make tighter turns.  I do motor man training on my X, and the other bars would limit my lean in some manuvers.  Great buy, would recommend to all vtx riders.
B00E6A7NB4|5|just as described.  cute stick on, going on my monster blue Ram Pick Up off road truck.
B0016LG0CY|1|I don't even know where to begin with this thing first of all it didn't even work. Second of all the fuse blew third of all it didn't even go all the way in to my cigarette lighter nobody waste your money on this thing Go to Walmart and buy the same thing for $2.89 that works better
B00KOAMXC4|5|The fuel cell straps are of a good quality  and easy to install fast shipping too
B000C55MVU|5|Thank you
B005N53AM2|1|It stinks so bad you won't be able to tolerate it in your car. Real Trash!!
B004LX3AXQ|5|Excellent charger and does exactly what is was meant to do.
B00MC7H3LS|5|These are super bright, much brighter than the incandescent bulbs I had to buy because the Phillips &#34;street legal&#34; drop in LED kept making my  2010 Subaru's dashboard error indicators light up. Big difference between running light and brake.
B009774HM4|5|Great product!
B00JHWIE50|4|Some of the leds didn't work, but most of them did.
B000VT0JLU|5|Works like they're supposed to, super easy to install.
B000EQ80NE|5|Fast shipping , very pleased
B001AVVWZK|5|Works great with regular drinks. I wouldn't put a 32 ouncer in it but does the job on a regular drink.
B00EI6CKVE|5|I had people taking pictures of this thing when I was parked somewhere.  I loved it, was a little fun to put on with all the small cuts but it wasn't to difficult and I'm not very experienced in it
B00EF1EW6S|5|Great fit
B00EAOIR8O|5|Fit my wife's 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited 3.6L V6 just fine.
B005RJ3GBE|3|Need lots of adjustments but did get it together. For the money, nice when done.
B007BL4WPA|5|Was relatively easy to put onto my 2003 dodge ram 1500. I replaced my old one since it was faded and it was time for a new one
B0051SE3ZY|5|Great fit and great price!!
B001CABD8A|1|This was claimed to fit my 2001 BMW Z3.  It didn't.  Now I have to go through returning it.
B000PX0H64|5|Great replacement struts
B00B9LM64M|5|Good Seller A++++
B00V3JRRPI|2|States it comes with easy program instructions? I didn't receive any instructions?
B0017OCROA|5|It fits our Harley Street Glide perfectly!!!  We love protecting it from dust and other things while in the garage.
B00H2VVQNU|5|Not gonna beat a dead horse here. This stuff is the best bang for your buck that you can get. Coats well and really dresses up the metal. Rust proofing is top notch and I use it on all my vehicles.<br />Only thing to add with everyone else, this stuff STAINS ANYTHING IT TOUCHES. So just be cautious and wear the right equipment, and protect things you don't want coated black cause this stuff can run and drip.<br />Overall, best investment you can make to protect metal from rust.
B00HE66D1S|2|Paint is a shade darker than original paint.  Doesn't apply very easily.
B003U7REDG|5|Worked as expected. Installation was a breeze though I would have liked some sort of universal connector. I ended up snipping the one that came with it off and using the one the one that came with my car.
B00PQWN5DQ|4|I’ve only used the tire gauge a few times, but it’s the best I’ve owned.<br /><br />I have a new 4-wheel drive vehicle and take it off-roading, and “airing down” is common place in that world . . . so I wanted to have a method (other than depressing the valve with a stone or gizmo).  Your bleeder valve provides that feature, but I’m finding I can let air out just as quick by slightly depressing the gauge on the valve.  I thought the bleeder valve would be my favorite feature, but there are two others I like more:<br /><br />1) the swivel, and angle of the head of the gauge.  I bought new wheels, and they don’t have as generous of a space as my stock wheels did to fit in a straight up and down barrel gauge with a straight head.  Yours works well for my need.<br /><br />2) the way the reading “stays” until you clear it with the button.
B000CB7DWK|5|Fit well!
B00MW8G78C|5|Works perfectly.  My favorite aspect of this product is that the dealer wanted to charge me some ridiculous amount ($125?).  If you need a new keyless remote for your Honda, I would highly recommend this.
B000Q86K6O|2|Used it for a Torqeedo electric motor.  Pretty unstable.
B00EE56UAG|5|perfect
B007PLZ5RA|2|Great sticker. Peeled within a month however :/
B00NM5ILXS|5|I just installed this winch on my 2016 Kawasaki Terryx4. This is a great deal and it really works well. The installation took a little time as you must find a suitable location for some of the components. The winch looks good and works great. I also used the superwinch bracket. Great product, great price and great service. five stars
B00UO4EAEY|3|This car seat custion is OK.  Doesn't fit my car as well as I would like but it does provide the lumbar support I was looking for.
B0035UDHZ2|5|These things make changing tires a breeze. No need to stand on the tire to keep it on the rim while spooning it on
B00S59M9QG|5|Not flat or gray like the picture in the listing. Not like a decal or sticker. Attached pictures to show what it really looks like.
B00407GSG4|4|Exactly as expected
B006AWVZNS|2|It is not a regular sticker.  It requires a different technique to be applied.
B006FZBLJ8|5|Excellent product
B003CGDSBC|5|It fits and works well.
B000C7YRNM|4|Good quality and reliable… last one lasted 13 years..
B00EEM8534|5|Just as described.
B000RN2AHQ|5|looks very well on my motorcycle
B001VC2G2G|5|Haven't put it on my truck yet, but I've bought a similar decal before that has lasted over a year now and it looks great. I love that you can add the full name, dates and choose a color you want, if you want a color. The message they send for your loss is very nice, too. Would definitely purchase again if needed.
B000MK4FNG|3|Did not have keys to the locks or bolts for installation. I can go out and get bolts easy enough but to have keys made is a little more costly. The boxes arrived in good condition and are a decent buy.
B000MW91RE|5|Works great for sanding the ink off Legos. My kid makes some awesome Lego dudes now.
B009S9RO9Y|5|Bought this  for my father who already has his NRA sticker on his pick up truck he absolutely loved it & installed it right away
B00GIXFMHE|3|they look nice wish it was actually metal not plastic, does not look quite right, scratches real easy
B00IZNHLNI|5|Worked as advertised! Brought my 2005 Tahoe Z71 to perfect level height and the ride did not change at all. You do need a torsion key tool to remove and install the bigger keys. Very happy!
B007N6P76G|5|Had a lot of steering wobble with factory shock put this on and it was gone
B0071FO66G|5|Amazing!  Perfect for three booster seats in a row.
B0031I3TNI|5|Perfect fit and easy to install. I removed the old light and plugged this one in and everything worked great.
B00GHT6SF4|2|EXCELENT
B00QWSNIT4|2|smell no good
B00F9RNIPI|5|great product, cord stretches a good length...
B010DP8PIU|5|I can't believe I dealt with so many frustrations in the past with dead car batteries when such an awesome invention such as this was available! Ever have a dead car battery in the middle of a parking lot when you're in a rush? Or when your car is in your garage and you can't even arrange to fit another car next to it to jump start it? Or when you wait 45 minutes for a tow truck or AAA to come help? Or even having to ask some random stranger to take time out of their day to jump start your car? Well I have and it's sure a hassle. Now I'm able to avoid all of these issues with a simple, portable, and compact car jump starter. I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I was very happy to get such an opportunity. I promise that my review is fair and honest. This product comes in a beautiful and well-made case that is of high quality. Inside, as seen in my photo, is the jump starter, the cable to attach to the car battery, a car charger, a wall charger, and a USB plug to charge your phone as well as a quick instruction manual. It came fully charged and I have it stored in my car and it is ready for use when my car battery dies next. This is such a wonderful product and gives you piece of mind knowing that you won't be stranded the next time your battery is having issues. It's also great to have the flashlight feature (which is extremely bright) as well as the 2 USB ports for charging phones. It charges quickly and effectively and has a large battery. Anker makes quality products and this is no different. I highly recommend this product for everyone with a car.
B00ANBYMZU|4|Pros, Fit perfectly on my mk4 jetta, cons, the purple shown in the pic is darker than the actual piece
B000C7QJC4|5|Worked great!
B009S9RURU|5|hehehe I love it, and it actually looks like my baby
B0007RDVFW|5|Best tire dressing I have ever used. Tires look great and it last long time or until 1st rain and wet roads!
B007IW6ZFM|5|Perfect!
B007V2CBFM|2|Careful what size you hope for may not be sent even after reorder. Otherwise the product is really sturdy.
B003R79NU6|4|fit like it should
B00LC82GZQ|5|Using the instructions in the glove box book, this established correct contact with the vehicle in just a few minutes. If you don't still have your book, you can download them quickly, or buy a physical copy off Amazon.
B000HTS5JC|5|Good
B0002U268M|5|3M makes good stuff.
B004809YBE|5|Just what we needed and delivered to our door. High quality cord and ends with carry strap. we are happy campers!
B00008RW9U|5|I had my previous one for 10 years and finally got a new one.  It's not good the 1st few uses however after that it's great.  It loves getting dirty!
B0053H54O2|5|love
B00KTIUG5C|5|Remotes worked great and the price was awesome.
B00I0W1KD6|5|great product from germany. sometimes i,ll eat mexican food in the ricky booby dodge, me and the wifey will have a fart contest, the wife always<br />loose, turns straw into gold......
B008970MD6|4|So far it is staying on. Looks great!
B00BPM1JCA|1|Not even worth the money unless you don't drive at night, had them in for 2 days & couldn't see at night & no blue look to them at all except the color of the glass when lit they are dull & white. Put oems back in & can see again.
B000YC5ID8|5|Great little kit for installing an air system! All the parts needed with some extras left over.
B00771Z83O|5|As OEM.
B004GCQK70|5|Good quality. Fast shiping.
B00CW6GU2M|2|They do the job but they do stick out very far.  I can't keep them on the bike because they will hit the exhaust.
B00GWWUR3U|5|Like the color, no reflection
B00AP7CS7Q|5|I love this sticker and get man remarks on it.
B00B7WU528|5|Right feet and good quality
B00620PXMW|5|THis thing does exactly what you need and is of a nice sturdy quality.
B006FDD74W|5|I was pleased
B00YI3IGA6|3|UPDATE:<br /><br />After having this item for a year, both sides have completely fallen apart. This may not be as big of a problem if you have covered parking. (I am using my garage for storage right now.)<br /><br />It didn't fit the shape of my door well because it is tapered, but I was able to keep it from sliding up by pinning it under the window trim. Once I rigged it, I loved it.<br /><br />However, I do not love it enough to buy a new one every year! So, I will look into a competitor this time.<br /><br />I will say that their customer service emails are hilarious and adorable. But their product only lasted a year when parking uncovered. :(
B0013FFPX8|1|I have a 98 Chevy Silverado with the newer dash and the button is just a little to big. It is now stuck in the radio and I cant get it out.  They claim it fits my vehicle but it does not.  don't waist your money.
B00UZ4NIWS|3|fit is not perfect...
B000CO9CA8|3|They do not fit the 90 caprice without modifying the subframe
B007JMTQTS|5|Nice product even if a bit expensive. Good quick service.
B000NPUJQC|5|Excellent!
B00NORK0G0|5|Love this sticker definitely worth the money
B00HQZNOQO|4|Nice part for the cost. Better surface than fabric OEM.
B00PV6U1N4|4|Easy install.  Although, a slight adjustment to the dome light contacts was required.
B00032K9R4|5|These look great on my Challenger! I could.not be happier with the fit and finish!
B00GAA8D5S|5|Great product Well Pleased
B00RW253EC|5|This key fob works perfectly. Big savings over going to dealership.
B0000AY3SR|5|This works great! I used to use polishing compound to remove the haze followed by car wax. That was a bit of work and did a pretty good job. However PlastX did a much better job in about 20 seconds per headlight. You can see the yellow stain on your cloth from the oxidized plastic the product removes. The headlight lenses come out crystal clear. I highly recommend this.
B0009JKI8G|1|Purchased for my dodge Sprinter van...totally useless item...without value...will not glide across window<br />Without stuttering (yes, I tried cleaning the window completely) might work in the smaller sizes, but NOT on mine
B00BTGDR9A|5|Excellent product,bought my first buffer and have used this several times w very good results, the pad cleaner works very well
B0009TAOBW|5|This trailer ball works great! Highly recommend this product.
B000WJ3I1M|5|I will fit a large Dunkin Iced Coffee Cup!!
B0083G3AXC|4|It is plastic and doesn't look like it would hold well, but it works well. Taking it off is not as easy as putting it on,  but you get the hang of it pretty quick.
B008DIZ1S2|5|Fits my personality! Love this holder!
B005EPLJJC|5|Just like the original one
B002DOME1E|5|helps a lot ...
B00CBN5H4S|5|If you are installing -AN hoses for your radiator, this is a great solution. Beats welding a fitting onto the OEM housing, which I did, and it looked out of place. This has a very nice finish from the factory, and looks even better if you powdercoat it.
B008VJ9UEE|1|Description incorrect.  These bulbs do not flash when you apply the brake.  They work like any other brake light.  I bought these in hopes of making my motorcycle more visible.  Very disappointed.
B010MNRE2G|5|So far so good
B0085IJCIK|5|This was incredibly easy to install and worked fantastically on its maiden voyage this past weekend.  It is solidly constructed and fit my draw bar perfectly.  Very pleased.
B008HZOPLA|5|Work great on my Audi Allroad. Quiet and good feel.
B00TJ6FUWO|4|Arrived just as advertised.  I like that it doesn't come with a plug as there are so many different iterations of 220 plugs.  My Volt now charges in a bit over three hours, allowing me to charge at home overnight with the original 120 unit, and charge at work with the new LCS-20 unit.  I now commute gas free for 75 miles per day.
B00XHERTPA|4|rebuild went well.  no instructions come with it but plenty of you tube videos out there.  only reason I rebuilt the turbo is I needed to replace pedestal O-rings, so I thought I might as well do it all while it was out.  I also replaced up-pipes during this rebuild.  I have a highly modified 2002 7.3 excursion, so really did not see any performance improvements with this.
B000BSY9J4|5|does the job without a problem.
B00SGXS1XG|1|The pegs look good but won't work for me.  Guess I miss interpted what these were.
B00IWHHU7O|4|Good product at a fair price, would buy again!!
B00KTIVFTS|2|I was unable to program the fobs to my car even though i followed the directions...disappointing
B001TK7CYM|5|Nice goggles.
B00EJSNDAI|4|I really like this product. It doesn't hurt my legs and it has a lot of grip. The down side is that it is kind of small. It could be a few inches taller.
B002GO784Y|5|worked out perfect from timely delivery to easy installment, thank you.
B000C5I2YO|5|Fit perfectly in my 2010 Ford Explorer and was even delivered on a Sunday! Came in the original packaging and was in great shape.
B00GHT8CV2|5|I like Dorman products, have purchased several to replace broken or worn out items on our vehicles, and never had an issue.<br /><br />This coolant overflow jug was exactly the right product for our older Ford F150 pickup truck, and was relatively easy for me (the man of the family) to put in myself. The hardest part was getting pliers on the squeeze-clamp on the base of the old, cracked and leaking unit (when did it get so old? Ha ha), and getting the hose to come off. Put a basin or something pn the ground underneath if you need to catch the water/coolant mix that will flood out, especially if you want to use it again. In my case, I wanted to home-flush the whole system, so I parked the truck in a spot where some drainage of rusty old liquid wouldn't hurt anything, got underneath, and removed one end of the lowest clamp and hose. I let the old liquid fully drain (quite a bit of sludge in it), then reattached the hose. I connected the two hoses on the new coolant overflow jug (easier to put on than take off, and as you see from the product photo, the new one comes with a fresh upper hose). By the way, when installing, the bottom of the tank is held in place by a built in clip that goes over a hole in the truck frame. You'll need the old screws for the two upper brackets. No big deal to insert and tighten down with a ratchet socket. I then filled my cooling system with fresh water only, from the hose, and ran the engine for 10 minutes. Then I disconnected the lower hose again and let this now dirty water drain out.  I did it one more time as I don't have the ability to pressure flush. By the time the next batch drained out, it was relatively clean. Now I put in two jugs of new coolant purchased from a local auto supply (its supposed to be mixed 50-50 with water so I guessed at that), and added fresh water to the mark on the new reservoir, screwed down the cap, and that was it. Less than an hour's work all told.<br /><br />Brand new reservoir -- recommended.
B007GBJ99Y|5|Grandson got this and he likes it.
B0013FXWYW|5|Good

B009W08ONY|1|Not recommend
B00NJRGD70|5|Fast delivery. Attractive packaging. Easy to use; easy to store and put away. There is definitely a change in temperature when I get in my car. Works great. The only thing is it may be just a little to big for my 2015 Chevy Traverse BUT in putting my car's sun shades down, it holds fine. :)
B00NR6TO6A|5|Beautiful magnet, looks great on my white CrossTrek.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Awsome lights,thank you very much<br />I got about 5 sets now, love how bright an clear not yellow but white at night like daytime Very good lights thank you guys very much,,<br />I need you to send me a 7&#34; now so i can try it before i buy it an do a report on it,,<br />Thank you<br />Very fast friendly serive an fast shipping

B004TMP18G|5|en realidad sirve
B00C5AK0US|5|My Ford F-150 sounds so bad ass!!! And the dealer wanted $2500 for just one side! I paid less than $650 for both and less than $300 for installation!!!
B00XBEJZA8|5|So my husband has been bugging me for one of these for years now... he just bought a new truck so i saw the price on this and jumped on it... he told me one of these usually cost over 200 so when i say this price i purchased... the only negative thing about it is that it didnt come with instructions... which im pretty sure my husband will get it he knows this type of stuff... but for me... ummmm no lol...
B001449L5G|5|right carb kit right price
B00HS0GV4E|5|The product fits into my car without any stress.
B007MUY50W|5|Perfect fit and quality!
B00Q1HBSKM|5|I had previously some cheapie LEDs installed on my F150, they started flickering and half of the diodes stopped working within a few months. When I took them out I noticed they were falling apart in my hands because they were put together with Hot Glue. Well it doesn't take a genius figure out that the Hot Glue will melt with the heat of the bulb. There is now gobs of glue permanently stuck inside my light fixture.<br /><br />I bought some temporary bulbs from my local auto store, they were worked ok( &#34;nothing to write home about&#34;).<br /><br />When these ARTR 80W bulbs arrived I was impressed by the solid construction of them( No Hot Glue), even the contact wires looked of better material. They are bright during &#34;Parking&#34;? mode and amazingly bright during Braking and Blinker mode.<br />I also bought the ARTR &#34;Switch Back&#34; White/Amber for the front of my F150, they are also amazing!<br /><br />I'm using the Novita EP27 Flasher Relay instead of Resistors, The Relay works perfect (&#34;No Hyper Flash&#34;) the LED's.
B00BJ2DG3G|5|Replaced the old actuator perfectly.  Reverse lockout is a nice improvement to have,no more getting out to move the lock out pin.  The reverse lockout solenoid was not tight and leaked, had to tighten it and it was good to go.  No place for a lock, I'll look for a locking option.
B00VHW92QS|5|Fit perfectly
B000CO76EW|5|fit my 1996 ford f250 perfectly.
B00RE6KV48|5|Very Easy to apply.  I have a black leather sectional and it looks moisturized and brighter.

B000C30J1U|5|Good belt, but when ordering make sure you make sure you order the one with a/c if you have A/C or u will not get right wrong belt, belt itself 5 stars,communications on ordering right belt 1 star.
B00CB1D3A0|5|PERFECT!

B00N9HIR42|5|Fast delivery and as promised
B00RGZWIW0|5|I have been looking for the right trunk organizer for a long time.  When I found the Busy Life premium trunk organizer my search finally stopped.  It is the perfect size, material, and high quality that I wanted.  I couldn't ask for anything better.  And it sure did come in handy the other day when I bought a couple of cantaloupes and a small watermelon from the farmers market.  No fruit salad from that trip!
B00AE86VWO|4|Great product that holds up to the abusive weather!
B00FMOGJTA|2|Is very hard to put on doesn't fit very good....
B003E24MK0|5|Installed beautifully. Smooth braking so far.  Wish they came with abutment hardware.

B007SOOQTC|5|Very good quality
B007TY9Q3C|5|Bought this for my 2002 Trailblazer and it was a perfect fit.Very fast delivery
B00PIJ0KYE|5|You need one of these to attach a Steelie to a dashboard in an older vehicle [I have a 2004 Volvo S80] where the dash is textured. This spreads the force so the Steelie can mount anyplace on it and still hold a decent radar detector steady. The adhesive works well, simply by following the instructions - how often true - but allow plenty of time and air to clear away the alcohol vapors so the 3M adhesive can develop full adhesion.
B000IYLZDO|5|Worked perfect!  Easy to install!  OEM part.
B003CJWOXC|5|Fork seals arrived within specified time in original packaging. Seals seem of excellent quality. Other reviewers on this site and other sites rate this seals highly. Will be installing them soon along with new dust covers on 1986 Honda Rebel 250.
B0055UXZS4|5|Works and fits very well.  A little long when rolled up and not  in use.
B00M8F23A0|5|I gave this five stars because I did not want any negative issues to reflect back on the dealer. The bar came on time and in good condition. I would definitely use this seller again. Now: I really like this bull bar and it looks good on my 2015 Highlander. I took it to a specially shop that only installs hitches, bull bars and running bars. They do business for several new car sales lots. They got it installed, but they were not happy about the unreadable, generic instructions. The bull bar is for a specific vehicle, but the instructions were generic, which made them useless. I was going to have black horse running boards installed next, but because of this instruction issue, they will not install anymore black horse products without approval of the instructions in advance. I wrote Black Horse, but have not heard back from them. The new Highlander has a completely covered bottom, so good instructions are a must. I cost the installer an extra hour because he had to remove the entire bottom of the car to find out where the parts fit.
B00FM0NGE0|5|Look and sound great on my truck
B009VI3T96|5|This is a sturdy robust set that did not disappoint that I used in the rebuild of a boat trailer.
B001OMPJGS|5|I can finally see again at night without having to turn my bright lights or fog lights on.  Great upgrade to the stock stuff and very reasonably priced.  Easy to install.  Just don't drop the screws.
B008M7NC76|5|Great fit for '99 CR-V! I like the flat black over the stock, white lettering of the old CR-V cover. This cover did not have a zipper like the stock one, but I see that as a plus as the zipper tends to seize up over the years. Glad I went with a more expensive tire cover!
B0002KNVPE|5|I've been using this for a while on my 93 Integra (stock b18a1) as vacuum lines and so far its been doing the job. It fits nicely, needed to use some wd40 to get the plastic holder loop things on it but that's about it.<br />I would recommend.
B000IZ5E1M|5|Fits and works just like the original one did. Genuine part, and no problems!
B006ODSYVO|4|Really good and on time
B000GU7I72|4|I have a Kawasaki Vulcan EN500C with a passenger seat attachment.  The Large and XL were too small.  The XXL fit just right.  I'm very surprised that the description for the XXL is for bikes with more than twice the displacement of mine fully dressed.  Don't know how my 500cc cruiser will fit with the Street Shield windshield installed but great so far.  Lost one star for the sizing information but otherwise seems great.  UPDATE (9/18/15): Saw 2 holes on the lower (silver) portion.  Appears to have melted by contact with the metal parts.  I thought the silver was a heat shield type of material that could withstand heat but apparently not...
B00KSSYNIE|5|👍🏽👍🏽
B00NF183HI|5|Have torx bits and some patients handy and you will have no problem installing this. Using armor all on the shifter handle helps as well
B0001CMUV4|2|When tightened, lists hard to one side. Its not bent or cut straight
B0002SRH5G|3|Works as described but is very fragile and cumbersome to use on space constrained modern motorcycles.  Gauge needs to be better protected and should be able to be detached from the tool body.
B004PHIAJ2|5|works good
B000BGK22E|5|Installed in minutes, works great, stopped the leak I had. Smooth action.
B00282YGA8|3|This blade did fit my 2012 Ford Focus, but the blade I received does not look like this picture. In fact, it does not look like the picture in the box either. Makes me a bit concerned...but it does fit.
B00BSOLB6E|2|I have put on many &#34;jdm 2 peel stickers&#34; but this one is by far the HARDEST...!<br />I still putt it on my car.. however whoever made this does not know the kind of material to use..<br />when I go to press the sticker on and peel the clear coat off the sticker sticks to it like crazy..<br /> I have never had that problem with these types of stickers..... the jdm band ad wad HARD put on.... but not as Hard as this one....!<br />good luck spending 30 mins to put it--- on without any bubbles..
B0085YOIW4|4|Wear this in the heat of a South Florida summer. Not as protective as leather, but you won't die of heat stroke--so that's nice.<br /><br />Padding is okay, will probably beef up the spine protection though.
B001G7D792|4|Easy in and fixed the problem,
B00LV8P9R4|5|I purchased this jacket and then changed my mined, so I tried to cancell the order but it was too late so I decided to wait for it and give it a try. Well needles to say I loved it!
B0002SRDUU|5|It worked exactly like it should.
B004SS6EVO|1|Not durable at all and is not waterproof.
B008BMQYGI|5|Came fast and it's awesome can't wait to give it as a gift!
B009MASZ1K|5|Glad that I bought this. It is a perfect fit and definitely blocks sunlight and reduces the temperature inside.
B0009IQZFM|5|I LOVE these drying towels.<br /><br />They really make my life easy. I hit the car with the leaf blower to most of the water off and then go over it with one of these and I am done. I have not noticed any scratching or swirling from using these and trust me I would know if they were causing that.
B000C57Z3S|2|Not the best.....binds when tightening and changes your settings...too many moving parts....one piece adjustable are good......solid are better......
B00E1XZ20K|5|My daughter loves them! Thank you! Fast, great price, great product!
B00N18BNKO|4|It was pretty cool..
B000AAMY86|5|Information makes all the difference.  With this on the dash, I can see very precisely what my current speed, MPG, and other information is. This allows me to tune my driving if I want to, without having obnoxious lights or sounds to nag me about things I don't want to know about.  I typically keep mine set to show, RPM's, MPG, AVG MPG, and intake temp.  These are just some of the settings that this device will show you and these are t ones that I like.  I like having RPM's showing because then I case the tax that the AC puts on the engine and turn it off when its not necessary.  The MPG numbers are good at keeping my foot lighter than it would be otherwise, and allows me to monitor how things are going.  Not sure why I keep coolant temp in the 4th spot.  I think its a throwback to years ago when I had a car that really ran hot so I was paranoid about it from way back when.
B00XV4F5NE|2|Kit didn't come with u bolts that you are required to install spacers, tried to call and order them separately but I never was able to reach anybody. Very dissatisfied.
B00353PWAW|5|Wash and wax.  Best wash I have found for my white car.
B0009IQZPW|1|too small
B000PWZR4C|5|I just finished installing this horn on my 2012 Vulcan Voyager 1700 motorcycle.  I installed it in the same location as the stock horn, which is just in front of the top radiator tank.  This probably isn't the best place to mount it because it will be more prone to road spray, but I wanted to keep the wiring simple and use the stock horn switch.  To connect to the stock horn switch you must use the included relay and then furnish your own wire (16 gage minimum), fuse holder, 20 Amp fuse, and connectors.  I already had most of the stuff on hand, but if not it would cost another $25 or so for the parts.  Instructions for making the right connections are included and are easy to follow.<br /><br />This thing is much, much louder than the stock horn with a big rig tone.  It will definitely get the attention of the reckless cager putting on makeup or texting their BFF.  So far it works great, but it isn't the sturdiest product I've ever seen.  The housing is chromed plastic and it is mounted with only one bolt.  I would not be concerned mounting it under the hood of a car or truck, but on the motorcycle it is flying in the breeze unless you fabricate a more solid or protected mount.  It seems a bit heavy for the stock horn mount so I'm afraid it may vibrate itself to death after a few thousand miles.  Time will tell but so far it is great.  I highly recommend .it.
B001KQD7YE|5|Purchased two and repaired both passenger doors on 2002 F250 CrewCab..  30min. per door tops.. should have done this years ago..  Great Price and Value / working perfect at this time..
B000AME5GI|5|Have these in my 04 monte carlo & love how much diff they make the aftermarket housings look during the day & lite up amber & night. I purchased them at a local parts store. I put aftermarket  housings in my cobalt & hunted around everywhere for them again with no luck & then finally found here. If you come across them at the $40 price keep looking. They're hiding but can be found for $25.
B001FZNIL2|5|Fit great
B00681BE2S|5|Worked perfectly, took about 20 seconds to set up on my 2008 Mustang.
B00199N5LW|5|Brought my Audi back to life!!!
B000BQWLE6|1|This thing is only six or 8 inches tall. what good is it.
B00026Z3F4|5|Does everything you need it too.  I jacked my 05 Malibu up a little to far back unintentionally and it lifted the whole side up.  The only complaint is the bar can not be secured in the press, which means you have to push the jack.
B008UA4NUA|4|Used these products on.... My leather duty belt (LEO), my Justin's and my Saddleback bag. It has worked great on all of the above. It did slightly darken the color of my boots.... It didn't affect the duty belt (only did the waist-side, not the black leather exterior) and it thankfully didn't change the color of my bag. But I don't care about it affecting the boots.<br /><br />The smell of the Number 1 is....delicious. Don't drink it obviously, but it smells amazing. The cleaner doesn't have a smell, which was a nice surprise. Some of that stuff can smell awful.<br /><br />I dinged it a star because of the way the cleaner comes out of the bottle. There needs to be a spout or some way of slowing down the flow better. It comes right out and flows directly down the side of the bottle and onto the floor. Sure, I can keep a towel/cleaning pad pressed against the bottle but I shouldn't have to. So it does get a little messy. The number 1 is considerably more viscous, so this isn't an issue.<br /><br />That being said, it's a small gripe for arguably the best leather cleaner available. Get it!
B00KTHWXH2|5|The key case replacement works great. A brand new key is attached to it so you will have to go to a locksmith that will cut the key for you. I lucked out at my local Ace Hardware.<br /><br />Also, you will have to literally (AND CAREFULLY!) break apart your old key case to get the little security chip out of it to stick it into the empty slot of your new case.<br /><br />I found a useful video on how to do it on you tube.<br /><br />It worked for me! Good luck!
B00FA846HA|5|It fits like it was original to the truck; and it was easy to install, thank you it looks great.
B000BNZ5BU|5|This is the best drying chamois I have ever used.  Amazing how well it works and how easy it is to squeeze out the excess water.  I bought 2 more  for a fund raiser car wash and we were able to use these instead of towels.  Faster and better.
B004HPSI6M|5|Very good, does what it should.
B009DJSG9G|2|Not the same as shown in picture.
B00LX6QZYA|5|i like it i thought it was pretty small but it matches the size from the one you see on the mirror
B00DQC5FNQ|5|My son's new favorite riding pants.
B0060LTPM2|5|Arrived in a fairly timely manner. The lenses look great on my '10 Silverado 1500. Would recommend these to other Silverado owners.
B001GRN5NK|5|slides around a bit but does catch the spills
B00ANZHG7C|5|You just cannot beat these wipes, they are good on any of you screens.
B0002MBA0U|4|I like this license plate frame. good quality
B000E81VN8|5|I love this.  I can keep it shoved to the back of the trunk out of the way but still carry the things I occasionally need.
B00XLMVAMQ|5|Love it ! Arrived quickly and very easy to apple!
B000XQO11K|3|the sound from this muffler is not what i was expecting from listing to the sound bits/reviews on the magnaflow  internet. roar (noise) in truck cab is  very high .
B00NI4CKU8|5|Very satisfied with my purchase. This part fit perfectly.
B000CQBG1O|5|Perfectly as described.
B00ME1N1OA|5|Easy install, great for my custom intercooler setup.
B00K802W08|3|Sticker looked good but when applying sticker did not have any stick to apply 👎
B000BGM240|5|as explained
B000VKTUJQ|1|This is NOT a direct replacement for a 2009 Pontiac Vibe. It can be crammed in to make it work but really, that's not right. STOP saying this is an acceptable replacement. Even the package when it arrived had a slip of paper in it that said it fit a 2007 or 2008 Pontiac. I ordered this as a gift for a friend. NEVER buy TYC parts folks!
B000182EUU|5|Works great.
B00WSPKR8A|5|Fast shipping, product works great!
B0015DLMOO|5|Well made and comfortable.  I have used cheaper stethoscopes that could qualify as an enhanced interrogation technique based on the pain they cause from the pressure of the tips on your ears.  The Lisle set is painless to use and does a great job of capturing the sound through the probe or the tube with the funnel.  The probe is designed to allow the user to touch the probe on an item to determine where the sound is coming from.  In my case I was trying to isolate a sound that was coming from the vicinity of the serpentine belt on my car.  By using the probe it was impressive at how quickly I was able to isolate the alternator as the root cause.
B000ARPVOI|5|I've always been intrigued by this manufacturers in store oil additive displays  so after replacing most of my exhaust system to clear my check engine light for my car, the light came back on after 1150 miles. I have cleaned the ignition module and not yet run a complete diagnostic and happened to see Lucas's injector cleaner on a store shelf while shopping and thought -Hey it cant hurt to try , can it?<br /><br />Thursday I filled the tank and added a bottle. I made my daily 100 mi. commute and noticed the engine sounded better. At first I thought it was just some placebo/wishful thinking. So, 205 miles into this tank, less than a half hour ago on my way into work the check engine light went out on its own.<br /><br />SO for less than 4 dollars I fixed the problem a mechanic would have definitely charged me hundreds if not a thousand to diagnose and repair.
B00450B3P2|4|works for what I needed
B00EUUNJRM|5|Everything comes with the bar except the wiring but it's a good sturdy bar worth the money
B00VUUKTQ4|2|While as a voltmeter it appears to operate well, the product image implies a finished product and what I received was a printed circuit board needing a case. Now I'm searching for a hobby box and a dremel tool.
B00MGRF2GM|5|Fits bike Perfectly 2009 Ducati 848
B00E65A2TO|1|Good
B001TK7CYM|5|love it
B002A8SZX4|5|nicer than other versions.  use on a boat outside.  perfect.
B00DNX93ZE|5|Wife loves the extra storage for her HD Bike. Yes its a pink one.
B0093LYB20|1|I installed the mirrors on 07-30-2015 and one of the mirrors fell off on 08-10-2015. I only drove with the mirrors for six days before it fell off. I tried to replace the mirror through Amazon, but it wants me to agree to send back the defective item obviously I can't it fell off.
B003IS3HV0|4|Very think to apply. Maybe if it came with an applicator that would have helped. Was hard to wipe on leather chair. Changed color of chair slightly which was okay because the chair has several worn areas anyway.
B00QO1YP5K|5|Bought a red trailer from harbor and slapped these on.  Perfect.
B0036R6IT6|5|Nice piece, I built a custom rack for it. The storage area is nice to put things in. A small cooler will fit in there also. The Velcro holds the seat pads in place adequately. I added some extra Velcro just to make sure they didn't come off on a trail somewhere. I also remove them when trailering the ATV.
B0007WXJDQ|5|Works like a charm!!!!!!!!!!!
B0024EC74M|4|I returned mine. Did not read the product description well enough. These will only work with refrigerators with wire shelves.
B003UT3S6Q|5|Runs out quick but works
B004I0P16G|5|Fit perfectly and received quickly
B003N9HIXC|5|Great to attach to belt. Easy to release key.
B0063IB5MU|5|Got what I wanted fast with no complaints!
B00S9S8NA4|1|want even pull 1400 watts appliance
B002VVIC06|5|easy to install
B001OJJWWI|1|sticks to backing waste of money poor quality.
B000BZ96AY|5|Installed because my old wheel bearings on my 88 prelude were bad.  After about 2 years they are still going strong.  Highly recommend Timken for all your bearing needs!
B00F5MU9MW|4|great product, the off button still lets some water through,which works great to conserve water and finish your shower
B008G3BC0K|5|This product fits like OEM
B00S0QLUUK|5|pretty great, I was able to start my truck with a totally dead battery (9 volts) with this and a simple $7 3 cell lipo from my r/c plane.<br /><br />my truck is not what I would think would be easy to start either, it's a 2002 f150 harley-davidson which has a supercharged 5.4L v8!
B00HJ6O4A0|4|Really like it. Great for the beach because you can shake the sand off easily. It's hard to fold after a few times because the creases go away, but it is still very light and easy to carry around.
B008HZOUU6|5|Put on Mercedes ml320, and they were exact fit, and don't leave brake dust all over the place.
B000E28N7G|5|As promised.  Thanks.
B000VLD744|5|Had to have it in order to install my bikini top it goes on and comes off really quick. Love it.
B0015FYQ90|2|I gave up trying to use this mirror.  It is not possible (at least in my car) to install it without having to remove or not use the window  shades that block incoming front window harsh sun.  Its one or the other-not both.
B000BRFGGA|4|Great little horn, I would have given five stars but, the package was opened and I had to spend five dollars at Pep Boys for solderless wire terminals and a package of metric nuts.
B00D2QL0DU|5|works fine
B000UUMM6K|2|It was the wrong size, could not open vent completely. Will purchase a different brand.
B000CNN444|5|Fit fine. Did the job
B004JO9FGI|5|I love them! The only thing i regret is not getting these sooner.
B0049CU492|1|This Item was not as described, and was returned for a refund.
B000N8K2UC|5|The product is awesome......it's a perfect custom fit for my car.....I love it
B007QBF8HG|5|Installation was breeze after I had watched a YouTube video. So far it is working great.<br /><br />While it is simple, Ford should rethink this design and I am not surprised that it broke in 9 years with very limited use.
B007IVSMTA|5|It fits perfectly; Living where we get 110 degree days, it surely makes a big difference when I get into my car.  It is worth the time to roll up after each use.
B00D1CQVIY|4|wireing kit  made it very easy to install.
B001TAPLYA|5|Perfect fit.
B009PC5ZXQ|1|does not glow much in the dark - need something much brighter.
B00LEBLI82|1|I ordered a 10 pack - not ONE light worked. I am replacing 1141 bulbs on a boat. Nothing. I tried reversing them, and tried. I tried all the lights. Nothing.
B005HMNJDG|4|all the LED lights work. the one for the trunk should be brighter than the current one in the kit. this kit is a little bit expensive compared to the one I bought for my 06 Sienna XLE which came with 11 lights for similar price.
B000BUQODG|5|all good
B0051MYL8E|5|Excellent value.
B000C11JGQ|5|This part does not come with a motor as noted. I have seen some replacements with the wrong motor shaft socket shape (hex vs sq). Although this one was correct, it would be helpful to add the flip view picture to confirm.
B001D6OIPI|5|fits great, nice shipping time. and great color match.
B00WDSVEE8|5|It's good
B00JGQUEQY|4|Good product.  Way over priced.  But hey if people will pay for it then keep the price there, just like oil prices and gas.  That's why no 5 star.  Install went good.  Instructions could be more detailed for a product you just dropped 700$+ for.  The Youtube for Teraflex is a great help but update your video.  The piece i got to mount the tire has 3 size options on it, not the 4 in the video.  The instructions need to be detailed a little bit more, or at least match the youtube video.  They are close but for 700$ you guys need to have this nailed!  Lots of OCD people out there that want things to be exact, and they should be for 700$.  Anyways install went good.  FYI when installing the adjustable mount mark the holes on your rim where the studs go through.  My tire has multiple holes for different vehicles.  Try holding the 100+ tire up trying to find the right holes to match.  Sucks!  Small details like that in the instructions would really help.  This unit is very sturdy and strong.  Tire rattle is less, but not all that sure that is completely gone non existent.  Still hunting that down, so not to sure.  Its much better than stock for sure, but it should for 700$.  As you can see the biggest downfall is the cost, but i guess you get what you pay for so i am still waiting for this thing to turn my jeep gold.  All things aside, i much rather have this unit than a 1200$ bumper and tire holder unit and have issues.  I went this direction because i couldn't find anyone completely sold on a great bumper tire combo.  This way i am not limited on my bumper choice either when i upgrade it.  Will update when i give this thing a good test.  So far its OK.  Truth will be in time and probably some small adjustments.  I know its just one day so i'll give it time to prove  itself.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Having this on now for several weeks i will have to say it is doing a great job.  No noise at all.  When i took my doors off and the hardtop off to see how the noise was, its SILENT.  Hope that it stays that way.that it stays that way.
B0002NYDYO|3|I does pack the bearings, but you have to push with a lot of force to get the grease into them. I was using NAPA white bearing grease, which I don't consider to be a thick grease.  Maybe next time I'll drill the holes in the plunger larger to see if that helps.
B00HAG5U0C|5|A+
B00M9IQK8W|1|I don't even know where to start with this...  First of all - the package I received only contained the top 3 pieces pictured in the image - lacking the remaining components, which I didn't realize were missing until after about 4 hours fighting to assemble it to my 2014 Honda Pioneer.  Besides missing 75% of the parts, the holes on the mounts didn't line up to the pioneer because the rear weld quality was poor, so the tolerance stackup made the holes off by about 1/4&#34;.  Second, my common brand winch did not fit in with the mount without modifying the bold hole locations of the winch.<br />I spent several conversations with Autoplicity on the phone trying to resolve getting the missing parts, and 3 promises of them being sent.  They never were sent.  It was the most frustrating experience I have had with any Amazon supplier.<br /><br />Now, after 4 hours of assembly, I am ticked off that I need to spend another 2 hours taking it off to return it.
B004ZF43Y0|1|Simple instillation with next to no help from the instruction manual.<br />After about five minutes of running they flickered and shut off. Had everything installed correctly and ended up returning them. I WOULD NOT RECOMEND THIS BRAND TO ANYONE. Spend a little more money on a nicer kit.
B0002KR88A|5|I was build a solar panel kit. This is my first attend and turn out work out prefect as i expected
B002EVWD44|5|I've been looking for something like this ever since my cars started to fade....it gives my paint a nice wet glossy look
B000GTZ9L0|5|These are great brake pads for the price.  I would buy these a thousand times over compared to the factory OEM pads.  I like that there are the two larger contact surfaces compared to the 4 individual on the OEM pads.  They seem to have better grip and function.  For the price and functionality of these pads,  I will buy them a thousand times over.  They are 1/3 the price of the OEM pads.  Love them!
B008A1BJ4C|5|Excellent! Exactly as displayed online! Faster than expected delivery!
B003VLBPJA|5|Does what it suppose to and at cheapest price I could find.
B0002MB80C|3|Mine broke when trying to switch it to my new truck after only one year of use. The stitching came apart.
B00BTLEHSK|5|Perfect for my car
B008GW2N86|5|Perfect fit for 2013 Honda Odyssey.  Only thing is item doesn't include installation manual which stated on the sellers note.<br />But straight forward installation.  Thanks.
B00S75DM0A|5|works a s expected. nice finish and the top of the covers are flat and do not have the bump that most SBC covers have.
B00P057UIA|5|Great quality! Product even has little rubber gaskets inside the cap to help keep air in tire.
B003TQ12K4|5|looks good... have not installed it as of yet.
B0066SHOI6|5|They're just jack pads nothing more simple than that.<br />You definitely do not ever want to drive your vehicle with out these installed, my latest electrical snafu on my 2003 e39 530 proved this.<br />Sort of off topic: If you ever get into a condition where all of the sudden nothing works from the drivers door (windows, mirrors, memory seats), no blower motor function, dsc light, abs light, check engine light, lcm error or lighting front and rear does not function look here&#62;&#62;&#62;<br />Measure the voltage at the window fuse or blower motor fuse, if it's 0vdc then you probably have water damage to the fuse buss that feeds the main fuse box in the glove box.<br />With the jack pads missing water will get into the floor boards under the carpets, there is a main fuse panel under the passenger carpets. You must move the passenger seat all the way back, remove the right kick panel, remove the door lower rocker panel cover and roll the carpet up.<br />There will be three wires that go to f119 that will short to ground and burn or become severely corroded to the point that they will break off the fuse buss.<br />These wires must be properly reterminated back to f119.<br />So never ever drive your beloved bimmer without the proper jack pads in place and never drive through deep water.<br />I would highly advise putting silicon caulking on the back side of the pads prior to installation just to add some additional sealing.<br />If you break one off in the future replace them immediately, I always keep extras for my other 2-e39's.
B000JNTEJG|5|Easy 10 minute installation on my 2007 Prius. 30 seconds to remove the original bolts, 8 minutes to start the new bolts by hand, 30 seconds to tighten the new bolts, and 1 minute to wrap up the air hose. Helps to have the wife holding one side, and using an air tool (butterfly wrench) of course. Tows my 4' by 8' trailer with a half a yard of gravel very well. Like having a Prius pickup. Lots of lookers with a trailer behind the Prius. I don't recommend towing a fully loaded 7' by 16' trailer, but I had to move it across the street for a concrete pour the following day. The hitch pulled this just fine.
B00ELRRYMK|5|Installed these in my aftermarket fog lights on my 2003 Dodge Ram 1500, they look great and were simple to install and connect to a switch.
B003PBTSYU|5|Love, love, love them. They don't stick out to far. They are a close fit. So mant people have asked me if they are automatic.
B00NAK9F3K|5|Changed all out on my 2000 Toyota tundra, and 10,000 miles out and working fine,good parts.
B00B2S2DW2|5|great quality.
B00IJ1P1LA|5|good stuff
B00CPL8PSG|5|This is hands down the best Fuel Injector Cleaner I have ever used. Right away I have noticed  increased fuel efficiency. I don't usually measure the  exact mpg numbers but the electronic fuel gauge meter bars in my car last longer after using this product under the same driving conditions.
B0071I2WZ0|5|Perfect fit.  Only 15 minutes to install
B00YI3IGA6|5|easy to install, light-weight material, blocks out all light.
B00P9EJGR0|5|These mats are so great, that I bought a second pair! The grandkids love them.
B00008BKX5|5|Exactly what we needed!
B005XQ9RUU|5|looks like oem part works great
B00N48TXO4|5|Husband said it was easy to install didn't really need instructions and super quality
B006N9DKVS|5|Fits fine on a 98 outback.  Took about 5 minutes.  This is for the rear.  You need 2.
B00OPBDYNU|1|Received the lights to find that they're NOT OE Lights but in fact made in Taiwan. They're also pictured with the bulbs and they didn't come with the halogens, so I had to purchase 4 for $98.00 extra! I'm praying that the install goes well and I don't have the same adjusting problem of the reviewer before me. Unfortunately, his review was after mine were shipped.
B003LS2PW4|4|Other than the oil, i don't see anything bad with this filter.
B00KMA1WUK|5|I haven't had any issue with the coating coming off, or the socket cracking so I would say these are pretty good lug nuts. I have already taken them off close to a dozen times while trimming my fenders and testing wheel fitment. I am assuming any issue arising from the coating and socket are caused by people cranking them down way too tight.
B000C7YQVU|2|Returned the product because it did not have an air bleed as pictured in the products photo. No air bleed results in having to fill the engine block from the thermostat housing to insure an air pocket doe snot exist beneath the thermostat.
B00J5BPMA8|4|This part is just fine and appears to be of great quality (made in Germany). The only problem is it does not fit a 2004 Ford Explorer with the 4.6L V8. When I purchased it, the Amazon app that confirms the fit said it was the correct part. It's not. Maybe for the V6. not the V8. Instead, search for part number FPS507.
B00150T13G|5|smells great doesn't last long...this is why I try to find it the cheapest I can. And yes it came sealed in its box
B00UHD4HJA|1|Very very unhappy with the stickers. They aren't glossy like if you were to buy them at a skate shop. Personally I don't like the stickers.
B006CRT72W|5|super easy to program.
B00FSIN0U6|1|Don't waste your money on this crap! Bought twelve of these led bulbs, seven months ago, six went bad. Led bulbs are suppose to last longer than incandescent bulbs, I am very disappointed, Dennis Dalton unhappy camper.
B00S6QELGY|5|I got this to replace the stock pump on my 1985 Honda VT700C. The inlet and outlet fittings had to be adapted down from 3/8 to 5/16 to fit the existing fuel lines. But then this pump wasn't meant for this machine. I now have what appears to be a staock pump on this cycle because it fits in the original mount. It is an &#34;on demand&#34; type of pump (like the original) which kicks ON at 1.25 psi. and kicks OFF at 1.75 psi.
B00WR99152|4|The product is great, works as advertised. Still requires some scrubbing depending on level of dirt. I wan planning to try to use this on paint one day, instead of ironx and trix.<br /><br />I knocked off 2 stars for the following reasons:<br /><br />1) Price. Way too expensive plus shipping costs. You should sell the 1 gallon version here and have shipping covered under prime.<br />2) The spray bottle makes too much mist and this stuff can easily blow back in your face. This is easily fixed by getting a higher quality bottle and transfering the contents.<br /><br />all in all 4.5
B0076WUD2K|1|Foes not got common steering wheel
B00U6G6LY2|5|Perfect
B0043063JU|4|Working out great on our deck.  Looks great!
B0041U918M|3|This was an easy replacement and I'm glad I did it myself.  The part arrived on time and undamaged.  As noted by other reviewers, the top two bulbs are switched and should be swapped back installing otherwise it's more difficult to switch after installation.  I wish the manufacturer or the dealer would switch the bulbs before sending them out.  Otherwise I would rate this as 5 stars.
B000F4D076|5|Thx
B005BNP7YU|5|Nice
B000HBNV9E|5|Worked like a charm.  I compared the different solutions before purchasing this.  Overall, I'm happy with the spray.  This worked great.
B00M6TEGDA|1|feak not working and order show  to me after 5 weeks
B00666NNQA|5|They were perfect work excellent
B00995JYLS|5|This replacement visor was perfect. It fit exactly like it said with no issues whatsoever for my 07 Civic Si. Price was the cheapest I found online also.
B008OIGAZY|4|It was hard to get over the steering wheel but looks good
B00LHUI4XM|5|Very quick receipt. Great Frame.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Awesome lights! Work great!
B000COMXCM|5|Good part for keeping track of your lug key.
B00SK49JNM|5|Very nice light
B00CZCY5SE|3|Nice light for the price,  not as bright as i would like though.  But for $10 it works fine
B005FL6M6A|5|Perfect for my toyota 4runner!
B004K27D5Y|5|Nice top
B000LP8F60|5|Never had an issue with my EZ pass being scanned. Small enough where I don't notice it in the windshield view.
B000AA4RWM|5|works as expected
B00EUU7O6O|1|PIAA HAS HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE…  I called multiple times and sent several emails, never had a call back or reply. The bar has nuts welded into the top; I had to tap new thread into that one due to weld splatter that clogged the threads.  The license plate bolts weren’t long enough to pass through the bumper and the back plate, so I had to go to the Depot and find some that would fit.  You’d think for the price, the quality control would be a little better.  Never will I bother with piaa again.
B00ON8WFBM|5|Awesome for the Pittsburgh sports fan.  it has created a little envy among my fellow pittsburgh sports fans that live in the area....yes, a sticker!
B000C57VGO|1|Wrong item showed up.
B004A343I8|3|Toll quite a while for delivery, Installed Saturday so far so good
B000X23AFC|3|Good cloth
B007ZDUAFA|3|didnt fit my 2004 nissan titan right, they have good a good ride, but caused alot of squeak in the rear, large bumps arent handled well. Squeaks could be a installation issue
B00BCRMA9Y|1|First I want to say, I do not like leaving a 1 start for any product, but I firmly believe this product deserves the 1 star. I wish I can get my money back for this product, and get my hour back from installing it.<br /><br />Pros..<br />1 - None<br /><br />Cons..<br />1 - I spent close to an hour trying to get this to fit my vehicle, not minutes.<br />2 - The material is extremely thin, and if you are not careful it will rip.<br />3 - Someone wrote on the material on one of the seatbelt covers.<br />4 - Instructions are minimal.<br />5 - Doesn't fit as expected.<br />6 - Cheap logo sticks right out on the front seats.<br /><br />I purchased this item for a reduced price to give an honest and unbiased review.
B00KTJ9V16|5|I was worried when I opened the package and saw 2 different remotes.  1 had words for the function and the other had pictures.  But they work fabulously. 2 of these for $14.99 each or 1 from the dealer for $95.00? Yep, no - brainer!  Don't let a dealership  tell you these can't be programmed, either.  Just go to a locksmith.  I went to a local locksmith and got both programmed for 20 bucks.
B00HR38050|4|installed on a 1985 step side.  gave me  3&#34; front  /  3&#34; rear. had to shorten the rear  shackle 1 &#34; due to bed clearance.  should get 4&#34; rear on fleetside.  also had to shorten the drive shaft.  rides well.
B0009IQZFM|5|Meguiars is top notch products.
B000AMW0GA|1|one year expected lifetime per manufacturer. The silver will peel off the back.
B00FS2TLAU|5|good cover

B00E9LP7FE|5|Thank you! Excellent product!
B009681GM8|5|Good product, thank you
B0109Z1GY4|5|Awesome piece of hardware for the best price
B001G3MAX0|5|Great product! If you have a sloppy shifter this is what you want
B0002NIJUS|5|Looks good. Should work ok.
B00KN6L8G6|3|Pros: LED<br />Fit my  2003 Evo<br /><br />Cons: Bulb is very long<br />Not very bright, same if not slightly brighter.
B001P22OY2|4|My husband ordered this to use on the 4 X 4 side so he could hook up to the trailer. He has only used it once but with this extension he can pull the trailer as the original hitch was so short that he could not make a decent turn.
B0057CJT8A|5|cool sticker, wish i got green though
B005J4NTL4|5|Worked perfectly.
B00ASMXEZI|5|Priced right and customer services was great.
B006WQSD1O|2|Lasted less than a year.  You are getting what you pay for here.  I would only put this on a car I was not intending to keep.
B000C57N76|5|great item, thanks!!!
B00CJ0251G|4|good cheap oem replacements. does the job.
B006MYFB9S|5|Best
B00C0X9X62|5|Awesome easy to install and I love it
B001H48R3U|4|Easy install, looks great.
B0022XBWHI|5|Very Nice item and good price to boot!
B005JCY7RG|5|Nice Product !!
B0010X5KPG|4|Works pretty good except the reset buttons.
B006X8BLN8|5|Easy install and looks great on my 2011 nissan Altima. I even plastic dip the front end to help the black grill blend in.
B0031HMS7C|3|Well, it didn't provide a long-lasting solution for me. I bought a few months of the starter working, but not enough to have gone for the labor-intensive repair vs the less-labor replacement.
B00I8IPD8K|5|I use these filters in my 2013 Jeep Wrangler.  They are reasonably priced and work very well.  Since I off road a lot, I change out my cabin filters often and these filters excellent.
B002OVHAOM|1|We received this quickly, but when it was installed by a licensed plumber, it leaked. Now I have to go through the process of trying to figure out how to get it replaced after it was installed, and pay the plumber to uninstall and reinstall the hydrant. Not a happy customer.
B0024ECIP0|5|Heavy duty cable that works well with my RV.  I use it to keep my expensive surge protector hidden from open view and in a secure section of my RV in my efforts to keep it from being stolen.
B0087NB5TW|5|Does what it's supposed to do perfectly.
B000T2W336|3|As noted in other review these straps are very stiff and not as easy to use as the original straps.  I cut the corner of the tabs that the straps hook on to (about an 1/8 inch chamfer on both corners) with a utility knife to make it easier to use the straps.  Without this modification I found the straps too difficult to use and needed to wrap a cargo strap around the bike frame and carrier to secure my bikes.
B000VKVXOG|4|I guess it is working-no problems to report.  Fit like a glove in my 2006 xB. Arrived quickly after my purchase.
B008OJWMM8|4|Worked great! We have A/C again. yippy
B000GPT3O8|1|Don't buy very weak don't hold up well at all
B00CJ18VAO|5|Looks great!
B003TEWPF2|1|Absolutely terrible product.  2 places cracked near bolt holes when torqued to manufacture specs of 10 foot pounds per inch. I returned this for a refund. I do not recommend.
B000OF64QU|2|The ad gave me the impression that this product would fit my car. It didn't. The product itself looked good enough. It just was to big for my radiator. The return went smooth. I'll just have to check to see that the money was returned. I returned the product with a return receipt requested.
B003ZXHIWW|5|These are sharp looking. Easy to install.
B0007ZL174|5|Very happy with the product.
B009ELIBHU|1|They absolutely do not fit. I've had Prothane inserts and they fit perfectly. Im not going to cut up my $30 mounts for $20 inserts or pressing them in which is not happening. The manufactures customer support offered no help except to deny that they have had any other complaints on them which is strange seeing that the other review for this item said they were extremely difficult to get them in.
B00080QHMM|5|Very Accurate and easy to use tire pressure gage.
B0006IX7YC|5|works great
B00AAR8JEM|5|Cool Product on my wrangler. Can only see it if its very dark not very visible in low light. But everyone asks about it when we go out at night.
B008Z8W5XY|5|Outstanding!
B00AZUCUY4|5|Great Karting shoe for the price!
B002809QXW|5|Good lock and key
B00SXEQEHS|1|I used the app on the site to make sure I ordered the right size for my vehicle, and it didnt fit. As a matter of fact it didnt dre@m about fitting. Very displeased..
B00E975M8A|1|Clogs, not easy to get out of the can, still not sure of what I was able to get on the material used to see how it works.  Would rahter brush something on next time.
B00AK9YVL0|5|The LinQ  base kit was as shown haven't installed yet waiting for sled to arrive.
B00G6IJFBU|4|works as advertised.
B00FGYRYPY|5|Awesome switch.  Perfect fit in the factory TJ switch.  Love that it says 'compressor' on it so I don't get confused on which switch is which.
B00BCQDQ48|5|Perfect
B00JXNK1Z4|3|Pretty pattern but cheaply made. Difficult to put on and the ties, well half of them had dry rot and they broke. Looks nice, decent for the price.
B0013TM0Z0|5|Perfect for my 1993 Dodge Dakota Crew Cab
B00BN45W28|5|This key fob is good quality get price t was shipped fast I would totally buy this and from you again
B000JZGMXK|1|this was the wrong part for my truck
B006TXCCE4|3|When installed they cover the seat functions.
B005HJ8B8M|5|Easy to install and classy frame.  Not overdone.
B0070YM43A|2|Perfect fit. I bought 35 days ago... removed only once and the vacuum cups no longer stick to the window. If it came with replacement suction cups would have gotten a 5 star review.
B00APOFQYQ|4|Exactly what I needed for my '06 Civic (silver).  Replacement was really easy - if you know how to use a screw driver, then you will be able to handle this replacement yourself.  So much cheaper and quicker than taking it to the dealership!  Only thing was mine only came with one screw, but since it was a replacement, I already had the screws I needed, so wasn't a big deal.
B007HH7EPI|5|Just what i needed to replace the one that broke off my 2000 Chevy Malibu.  (Sadly, I wound up having to order the assembly into which the antenna fits elsewhere, but that's no reflection on this fine product.)  This little beauty let me pull in FM radio stations just as well as the stock antenna did.
B00CM7XZD8|5|Great shipping, head bolts were perfect.
B00EVQHYO4|5|Works exactly as specified.Well made, easy install.
B00IHS3BA8|5|Fitment was spot on, sounds great, I love it.
B00FDQPCR2|5|Great light. Plenty bright that reaches out almost 150 feet. Directions are off so you have to adjust the day and dawn switch by your own feel.
B008OYNG32|5|Arrived earlier than anticipated; fit perfectly; easy to install!  Very pleased.
B00P8AM97Y|5|Highly recommend the Steadfast Auto Ford Mustang Tri Bar Rocker Panel Stripes. Gives my mustang that flare look.
B004HJHPCQ|1|grate product for my needs
B00BD4SK0Y|5|Using it for my MR2
B008X02KM0|1|Awful!  I don't think this solved any trouble at all--but certainly created some: the ride was soft and bouncy with all kinds of noises.  I felt that the vehicle wasn't under my control--a very eerie feeling.  I went with the Gabriel G56948 instead, and am glad I spent the extra money (I just wish I had gone this route in the first place).
B00L9NIFKO|3|A pretty generic intake system. You will most likely have to cut it to fit your specific vehicle. Cheap, does the job. I will probably end up making a short ram intake out of it.
B000C1A1V0|1|one year expected lifetime per manufacturer. The silver will peel off the back.
B000VKRQEM|3|Meh
B00X711S6E|5|It was a perfect fit I just loved it everything I get from Amazon is top quality I'm so happy to have them sometimes that you shipping it's a little high but otherwise it's okay
B000JFJLP6|5|I have the worst luck when it comes to no start situations at the most in opportune times.  Luckily I have AAA and can get some assistance in short order.  This device really brings piece of mind,  I charge it full once a month and throw it in the trunk.  Rather than wait 30 minutes to an hour for service, I can jump myself.  As of today, I've used this to power an air compressor and a jump for a co-worker.  I keep this in my car and check on it one weekend a month.  one of my best purchases.
B0000AYB7N|5|Great product fast delivery
B000KBH7KK|5|A+++,
B000KKPFFA|5|works as described, good to keep on your tool box
B00HS5W1Z2|5|Perfect fit for 2011 Avalon
B004JKEWZG|3|This Steerer Extender is made really well and is a heck of a value for what you pay. Unfortunately there is a fatal flaw in the design. This extender can only clamp the top 3/4&#34; of the steering tube. Other reviewers have noted that that there is only one clamping bolt, but the real issue is the shortness of the clamping area. I figured I'd bore out the clamping bolt hole and put on a fine thread grade 8 bolt and nut and torque it down. I might still do that, but I'll have to take additional measures as well. I'll probably cut the clamp off an old stem and use that in addition to the clamp on the extender. Then I'll tie the two clamps together with a thin piece of metal that is drilled to connect the two clamping bolts in the end gaps of the clamps.<br /><br />Montague has an installation video on youtube. I think that you shouldn't use this steerer extender unless you install it yourself. Even without the clamping issue, this extender doesn't look heavy enough for off-road use.
B0001EXKPM|5|Very good
B008ESIE8K|5|Worked great no problems what so ever.
B00GSAUHB8|5|I am so enjoying my new SunShade! Once I got the hang of how to twist it counterclockwise to close, it's a snap to put it up daily & take it down when I need to drive. Such a pleasure NOT to have to touch a hot steering wheel when it's 95+ degrees in Louisiana summertime!<br />A great item at a reasonable price.
B002VVNXCI|5|Love the sound. Easy install. Would highly recommend
B000MQ6L0U|5|Even though Amazon said this wouldn't fit my bike, I read a review that  somebody installed this fender on a XR650L. I took the chance since it's a &#34;universal&#34; fender that's only $22. In the template, there are measurements for a XR650R.. Not the same as the XR650L. The width is about 2mm off. Even though I ran into this, I was able to work some magic with my drill, and some shims to make it work correctly. On my bike, I relocated the wire harness that went through the bottom of the triple clamp and top of the fender to facilitate the installation of this fender.<br /><br />The quality of this is good and It is made in Italy.  I'm just glad that USPS didn't screw up the delivery and damage the fender. Overall I would recommend this fender to anyone with the ability of simple measurement and modification ability.
B00U8695HK|5|This really worked far better than I expected.  We'd bought a home model for our house and I thought why not try one for my car?  Within 24 hours, my car smelled much, much better!  I liked the air freshener that came with it, but it didn't last very long.  It truly did amaze me that it took so much of the stale smoke odor out of my car.  I've used it for about a week now.  It only &#34;runs&#34; when the car is on, and I don't journey very far, so it must work pretty well.  For the cost - I'd say the product is outstanding!
B00GHKMKT6|5|Got this part in order to take care of the &#34;limp mode&#34; of doom that plagues some Acura models. I was getting the &#34;limp mode&#34; slow acceleration and &#34;no gear change&#34; problem that started getting worse and worse. After using my OBDII and checking out some forums, it was ultimately going to be either this or the TPS that needed to be replaced. Long story short, this part saved me a substantial amount of money and was super easy to install. This part went on my 2007 Acura TL Type-S.
B000AM8BLI|5|Filled my auto needs and avoided getting an ticket.
B00G3BRNZ0|5|I've noticed a smoother Idle and maybe a mile or two in gas mileage but I do think it's worth the money. It does run smoother and acceleration is a bit better. All in all I'll keep using it
B004HXFUUQ|5|Perfect fit sucks I don't have the car anymore
B0049HCOT0|5|I purchased 2 for my outside deck, decided to only use one on the and I am one on my enclosed front porch.  These are very nice quality, look fabulous, and they are so easy to care for.  I had purchase 2 larger ones from somewhere else for twice the and half the quality.  I definitely would recommend these
B008QDXPFK|5|Worked as specified and helped me find the AC leak in my car.  The volume provided allows for about 3 applications, so I still have 2 more uses left.
B00KSXWCTQ|5|Fast and accurate, Thanks.
B00914AQPU|4|Good material a bit hars to install the back seat but all the hard work pays off
B003175DQA|3|Very Nice item and good price to boot and does the job better than stock one
B000TCCWS2|5|good and easy to isntall
B00AO6ILEW|1|Straps not properly cofigured to fit a human head.  Visor tab broke off first use.  Mushroom head.  Returned.
B0009IR0AG|4|I use it all the time
B003ZABBO6|5|Great, everyone is amazed how light they are. Great for loading our rzr, Harleys and indians.
B00VQK3ZBE|3|It fit perfectly
B010N7RW2S|5|APPEARANCE:   -  Compared to the many portable charges I have received in the past, this charger definitely looked much more rugged and durable.  The portable chargers all looks sleek, smooth, and modern.  This was a welcomed change to me and I love it.  The yellow and black combination reminds me too much of Dewalt's products, which may be a good or bad thing.  Good because Dewalt is very dependable overall.   - The unit isn't sleek and slippery like the portable charges, so it makes it easy to hold onto it with your hands; it won't slip.   -  As for size, it's very compact for what it can do.  It comes in a nice sturdy case with compartments.  It fits easily in your glove compartment or trunk.  PERFORMANCE:   -  Strictly as a portable device charger, it does very well.  It has charged my phone and tablets many times before losing power.  Anker still uses its amazing technology which recognizes the device connected and delivers the fastest charge possible.   -  I LOVE the screen on the side.  It displays the current level of power left in the charger.  The past chargers I've owned from Anker used simple 4 LED lights to indicate level.  This new screen is amazing and goes from 0% - 100%  so I know exactly how much is left.   -  There is a bright flashlight at one end which can be set to constant on, slow flashing, or rapid flash.  It's perfect for those times when you're stranded in a dark area.  Either light what you're looking at, or use it as a warning light to oncoming cars.   -  There is also an ON/OFF switch.  I'll have to be honest, I always forget to turn it off.  However, the unit does turn off on its own when not in use, so don't worry.  For me, I just leave it on the entire time and let it auto shut off.   -  As for jump starting a car, I actually attempted it on my 2006 Honda Civic Hybrid.  Engine size is small so I was hoping it would have no trouble.  A simple connection to the charger with the jumper cables and we're good to go!  SIMPLE!  I attached the clamps to the battery, and like how most have suggested, I left it connected and on for a good 15 seconds at least, then attempted to crank the engine; WORKS PERFECTLY.  There are also light indicators on the unit to let you know if the clamps are connected properly.  If it is, it'll be green, if it's red, retry again as the unit does not sense the connection.  VALUE   -  At $99.99 currently, it is a steal.  use it as a portable charger when you're not using it as a jump starter!  15000 mAh is more than enough juice to power your phone many times.   -  Anyone could use a phone charger.  Anyone with a car could use a portable jump starter.  This has it all in one!   -  Unit also comes with a car charger to keep it charged.  That means you don't have to keep taking it out of your car to charge in your house.   -  Overall, HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.  This product was provided for free or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review
B00STBE29C|5|Works great
B00EPA7CZC|5|Surprisingly good quality at this price point. Every bulb worked and not a single one has flickered or shown any signs of trouble. Amazing considering you can easily spend 20 times that for just a single 194 LED bulb. I've replaced the exterior and interior lights on a Mazda 6 and Mazda rx8. No issues whatsoever. Even if a bulb does go bad there so cheap you just replace it. Great product and kudos for the amazing price.
B00F670QUQ|5|I decided to buy a new 3rd brake light assembly due to mine being cracked.  The rubber seal on this great!  It even came with the light bulbs (which I didn't expect).  I was replacing the bulbs with LED's anyway.<br /><br />Works great!
B008JPV6ME|5|It a headache to install if you dont have the right tools but it aligns perfectly. You just need the right tools.
B00U3SR5MK|5|These levers are great. They were so easy to install, took me 10 minutes. They look great on the bike, way better than the stock long silver levers. They shipped fast (even coming all the way from China). I'd definitely recommend this product and you can't beat the price.
B00KVO4RZY|5|Great product, durable, a lot easier to carry around than the rock I kept in my pocket, just for this purpose.
B001U04MSU|5|Bought this to keep a large construction vehicle battery charged during down times.  The first unit lasted one week and then would do absolutely nothing.  The seller quickly replaced it and the second unit seems to be working fine for a month now.  The unit has good features for its size and works as advertised.  It quickly charges a large battery and then switches to float mode.  I have used the high frequency restore mode on several other batteries and it seems to work as advertised.  Overall, good charger for the money, IF this one keeps working.  Time will tell.  You can't downgrade a unit that had one failure considering the number of these things that are mass produced in China.  Other reviews are mostly positive so they can't be having a large failure problem.  UPDATE!!  Second unit failed exactly like the first unit, mid September.  Checked it one morning and the display was dark and the unit was completely dead.  It is on its way back to the Stanley warranty outfit in Florida who was efficient and polite.  Unfortunately the return shipping was almost half of what the unit is worth.  I assume I will get another replacement and we will see how long it lasts.  The warranty person I spoke with did report that they weren't having an unusual number of returns on this item and was surprised at my problem.  I am simply connecting it to a battery in storage and leaving it alone, exactly what it is designed to do.  I will update this again if more problems develop.  Starting to get worried with two exact failures in 3 months.
B00FWOKKGI|3|the customer service is terrible!! I had to fix the light myself! half of the leds were out! I fixed it works great ! only because they would not send a return label kept tellin me I hooked it up wrong! its a light has power and ground!!! then they wanted pictures!!?? just fixed myself ! light seems fine now nice n bright! save urself time n headaches order it somewhere else!! I was planning on buyin more of these in the future as I have my own shop but not with customer service like this!! their loss!!!!!
B004308V7M|4|Been on deck for a few months niw,Still a bright spot even on a dull day..
B00QWANBWQ|5|Very good product
B000IYNV5E|5|On time n correct
B002SAY33U|5|fit perfectly, easy to install
B00CMV7AEY|5|Works wonderfully.  Car is cooling nicely.
B002PQMP64|5|These lights are extremely easy to install and fit perfectly. All you need is a Phillips head screwdriver.
B010AI8VMA|3|Good
B00W1ZET04|1|I bought these in April and they are already falling apart. They were beautiful until the blue fell off then the letters started falling off too, see attached picture. I would not recommend buying these they are very cheaply made and don't hold up. I want my money back.
B008VL2PZS|5|These lights are awesome. They are beautiful and the colors vibrant. I did have a little trouble with the install because one of the battery ports did not work. I contacted the seller and they responded quickly and shipped a replacement box so fast that I thought they must've previously been a driver for that company that says they'll deliver your sandwich so fast you'll Freak. They were fast and professional/ courteous.<br />The only con I have is with the remote. It just has letters on it so I have to play around to find the right sequence but once found you can turn it on/off with the letter c button.
B009YRI64C|5|Just got this in and placed on my car. Super easy to apply and looks great!
B004SSDL8S|5|works very well
B007B86Z94|4|Keeps popping the led in the switch. I am probably putting to much voltage to it other than that the switch part works great.
B002803D6I|2|I had same issue as reviewer Steve Bell.  The lug bolts were too long. Great if you have spacers for your wheels. Not so much for own size for an E30.
B00GR2W6CU|5|Great color and adhesive!
B001EWWFFG|3|The weren't as big as I was expecting but seem to be good quality.
B009X9KGIU|2|Was not as positive an electrical fit as I thought it should be.  Due to its location, and possible replacement, I could only give it two stars.<br />Was a different size than the one it replaces.  No fit issues but ?.<br />The one I received does not look exactly like the picture.
B007WU6V0Y|5|Very good quality. Loved it...
B001GC2LVM|5|Thinking of buying one more. Very easy to get on and off.
B005M1RI84|4|Item as advertised. Arrived quickly.
B001UC3BNK|5|it work perfect so far
B0052FRP24|2|The handle was a bit darker.<br />Following the instructions on Youtube went ahead and installed it. It works. 2 stars for the following: the plastic part to which the metallic parts are attached do not fit easily. Had to spend quite some time to get those connected. When the handle brakes next time - I expect a nightmare removing it - it is not an easy access from inside as the openings in the door are small (for my &#34;big&#34; hands), and those thick wires were pressed into plastic dead - I guess will have to somehow cut them out if needed.<br /><br />so<br />PRO: it works, color almost matches.<br />CONS: poorly constructed, takes quite some time to fit. Color ALMOST matches (it is a bit darker).
B000BQ08QE|5|Short term experience, but seems to be the same quality as the ford branded steel/rubber gaskets I installed on my other car 10 years ago.<br /><br />Hate installing these as replacement for failed corks, always takes entirely too long to clean off the old garbage cork gasket material that has turned to stone...
B0085L1J7O|5|My 2001 750il no loger hisses.
B002PLJAB2|1|I never should have ordered this product. I took a chance and bought one that was used and the battery for the charger could not inflate the bed. After 30 minutes of huffing and puffing to get the damn thing inflated it slowly leaked all night. Don't you guys even check this stuff out before you try to resell it? Never again will I true used products for you.  Ruined my camping trip.
B00B788KRO|5|This definitely is my all time favorite spray!
B0089K33FM|3|The velcro that came with the dash cover did not stick to the dash. I had to go buy industrial velcro to  get this dash cover to stay on my dash.  The dash cover is very wrinkly and will not lay flat. I have had this dash cover for a month and it is still wrinkly
B005B0W4GW|5|Nice quality
B0042VVKGG|5|I hope to never post a firsthand review on how well these operate. ;)
B003YMBO2E|5|These look great
B005NLQAHS|5|Tried it on a 99 4runner<br />07 Chevrolet 3500<br />97 f350<br /><br />Worked awesome with all of them on the tourqe app.
B003PJOB6C|5|Great.  Easy to install, came with the fish line to feed the bolts through the chassis, and the fit was perfect.
B001P4BPHW|5|Great install & tuning instructions. Bike runs much better
B00064LQKS|5|Easy install and took care of the quick flashing blinkers.
B00X6DDXPC|3|It's really pretty but it gets really hot and hard to touch to remove from window. It also fans out top and bottom after being velcroed closed.
B00ABW6CCW|5|Got them for my boyfriend's birthday... he loves them.
B00D1CQVIY|5|Great product
B00TWLIXU2|5|So far so good.  The charger started my 4Runner perfectly.  Have not yet tried the compressor, but hope it works as well.  Very compact and easy to store.  Super lightweight and easy to carry and store, unlike the big charger/compressor I had previously (which was stolen twice, and now no longer sold anywhere).
B005HAT9SM|5|Would work better with a smaller handle or a contoured handle and needs more weight at the head.
B006YBD9PW|5|They fit perfectly including using the existing hooks on the floor.
B000BVB44O|3|Good so far
B00S5JWGDC|1|Wrong mirror no pressing.
B00RPIJP7O|5|Love it! Put it on right the first time though! Don't mess up like me :/
B000SL4A84|5|good item
B003CK0PEG|2|It really is amazing. Even when faced with photographic evidence that they have made a mistake, ALLBALLS maintains their dust seal with exposed spring and water/debris collecting groove is the correct seal for the ST1300 and others. What a bunch of idiots! Any fool can see this is wrong, but the customer service minion blindly toes the company line and claims they know what they are doing. Well, this engineer believes otherwise and I'll be using the OEM dust seals from now on if they persist on this nonsenical path. The lower oil seal seems fine, BTW.
B0012TPVC0|5|Does exactly what it is intended to do the bristles are good quality, and i use it every time i wash my bike.
B0049J8V8G|5|Converter fit perfectly, was such a good deal, sold old one for scrap, and almost paid for this one
B00OZSLNT0|2|The part fit well enough and looks just like the original part. It arrived, however, with two screws missing from the bottom panel of the cupholder. One of the detached screws was in the box, the other one wasn't. On closer inspection, most of the other screws were found to be loose. Superglue and a screwdriver fixed all these issues. But I shouldn't have had to. I contacted the seller about the issue and they were good enough to issue me a small credit.
B00JUQFVX6|5|This product is great! It has held up much better then I had expected. It keeps drinks and toys within my 4yolds reach as you can imagine makes car trips so much easier for me. I would invest in this model far better then some of the other models we have purchased.
B005J5D03K|3|A little rough and slow running, but does the trick.
B003UM0SY8|3|Received package, box was terribly damaged, thank god I have supplies at the house because it was missing several bolts to put it together. Disappointing
B0085FOF0S|5|PERFECT!  My caps for my 2008 Chevy Avalanche broke off after 5 years at the car wash.  These were the cheapest, and best quality.  I'd buy from the seller again!
B004A32AE2|5|Perfect fit at reasonable price + prompt delivery
B000GU5LSK|5|THANK YOU
B005CXLVQW|5|They worked great on my Rhino.
B001KQEODC|5|Worked perfect!!!
B00APN8V44|5|Thank you!!  The conversion kit was perfect so much so that we put rims on our Navigator afterwards. This is worth the conversion,  just find an awesome mechanic.
B002R1SD7M|5|I couldn't ask for anything better without the OEM cost.
B003CH3Z8W|5|Excellent works w pads fine
B0083SL82A|3|Not bad once you get the right hardware to mount inside your handlebar. Looks nice and functions well.
B000FW4MJ8|5|Wow, something actually useful for $1.  I order this size so as to not have a large one always open collecting moisture.
B002HI5HHO|5|Fit and works perfectly in my Craftsman compressor.
B002OQ4306|5|perfectly made and comfy.
B00L26Q81Q|3|Received as expected. Easy installation. Nice bright image. Light however stays on indefinitely unlike others that turnoff after a few seconds to preserve the projection system. Light actually turns off when the car system powers down all lights but this usually a very long period of minutes (BMW 5 series F10)
B000W7F2GI|3|Cheaply made but works with some &#34;suffering&#34;.<br />1. Adding another 6 inches of hanging cable will not cost more than 10 cents. The short length does not allow any practical way to hang the bottle<br />2. The same goes for the hoses.<br />3) The ascending tube is better quality (smaller diameter) quality than the center tube (thin wall)<br />4) Bottle thickness is slightly light weight. If you pressurize to bleed, it is OK, but Vacuum bleeding collapses the bottle.<br />Again, it works, but awkward
B0016H0O6G|5|good quality and great price.  used for Bar B que trailer.  had everything in kit needed to redo your trailer.  Includes those blue  &#34;scotch lock&#34;  piggy back connectors that just squeeze onto the existing wiring.  I replaced these with red or blue butt connectors and taped them with high quality electricians tape. This is the issue that several other posters have complained about regarding connectors.  the &#34;scotch locks&#34; are handy in an emergency but dont make a watertight or permanent connection.
B003YHFI5S|5|Awesome!  Great upgrade to make your truck looks years newer.  I used instructions that I found online rather than the ones that were included.  I had to buy a cutoff tool to get the plastic cut out.  The first side took longer, but the second side I knew what I was after.  Nice and bright compared to the cloudy 15 year old lights that were on the truck.
B003S1RQ2S|4|did not come fully charged, but seems to be charging ok now.
B00FFGWQPG|5|Sticky! Good Die Cut
B0002Q80RW|5|These are nice heavy gauge adapters, with wires well fused into the connector end. What else can you say?
B00YVHGTBM|5|Great product and very affordable for using on various vehicles to change options to better suit your driving needs.  Get the Carista app as well for the whole package.
B0008MGIGU|4|not a bad wiper
B00JQE049S|4|This was a gift for my Dad.  He loves it!
B009E6PRP4|5|Does as it should. Fits well in my 2007 VW.
B008JORKP2|5|Love this fire pit. Nice size, heats great, and came fully assembled. Just had to remove rocks from bag and arrange in pit. Love that we can have on our wood deck and it doesn't get hot on the bottom.
B000C2WCMU|5|Perfect fit for the Ford Taurus SHO V6. No trimming required.  Typical Gates high quality.
B007PVHVO0|5|Installed with very little effort.  Most importantly, it fit perfectly and works great.  Thank you, no more getting hit in the head when the door falls down.  Make sure you measure your old ones accurately and get any info off the old one before buying the new struts.  I originally ordered a set<br />of struts from some auto parts place, waited a week, and they didn't fit so I was happy when I could finally fix this pesky problem.
B00I26PXTC|5|Its nice, its a great quality sticker
B006DI3LBI|5|What can I say.  It's hard to rave about spark plugs.  I will say they are the most expensive spark plugs I've purchased.
B004I13LXK|5|Amazingly Beautiful. Not something you normally think of when talking about headlights right? When it makes such a HUGE difference in appearance I have to say again... Amazingly Beautiful! And it literally took me less than 5 minutes to switch out the units... 6 pins, 4 screws and two plugs and both of my headlights were changed out...
B00CPGQ1GO|3|serves my purpose well
B00HDMEUCW|5|They are exactly what I expected - soft towel-like material with a non-slip surface underneath.  I still have to use a towel underneath them to avoid getting my seat wet but I also sweat A LOT.
B00T5DJLGM|4|No complaints
B008FTZOJ0|5|standard tube, no frills. it holds air
B00KASS1WG|4|Five stars for the fit on the two front fenders and three stars for the fit on the rear averages out to four stars. These look good overall but if you look<br />closely inside the rear fender wells the metal is a little wavy and not quite flush all the way around.<br /><br />2015 silverado 2500HD long bed
B00F4MQJ5O|3|Very bright light.  The quality of the mounting hardware is less than I expected.  The seal is inadequate as I have moisture inside the light.
B000OCKJVE|1|Ordered one of these used when I received it all I got was the top for drum, the caster kit a hose and gun. I called and ask where the pump and tubing for the pump was. There reply was I DON'T KNOW. Don't ever order anything used from Amazon
B004AIFK8A|5|Excellent excellent excellent
B009OA37S4|5|the old one had 35k miles on it, and was filthy, this new fram  was a perfect fit, and priced right.  try to change it every 25k to be safe.
B0007VNZMM|5|Fit perfect!
B006B7YLX8|5|Good deal 3 one I have had , put one on every truck
B0091YXN46|5|Great lights
B000K8TN00|5|Get one.
B003DNFKTC|1|Poor fit....very thin material......more like a parachute than a fitted car cover.
B000ARTZPO|5|1996 Silverado K1500 5.0L<br />Truck was slipping bad from 2nd to 3rd, 3rd to 4th and when down shifting. I took some of the teams fluid out And added a bottle of Lucas Trans Fix. It was like a brand new tranny within minutes. Highly recommend this product if you are having Trans problems.
B00T2GT9L4|5|Second to the &#34;Glass Breaker/Seat Belt Cutter&#34; tool, this product should be a must have in every car.<br /><br />No more will you have to wait aside the road or in the parking lot (in the rain) for someone you don't know<br />or trust to help boost your car.<br /><br />This power kit brings 3 essential tools into one, making it an imperative tool to keep in the car at all times.<br /><br />~ The Flashlight is very useful especially for night emergencies when you have to find the battery terminals<br />in the dark or when changing a flat tire. It can flash like a strobe which is great at the roadside an night.<br />The LED is very bright too.<br /><br />~ The two USB ports on the unit are also great because who wants to be stuck at the side of the road with a<br />dead car and possibly a phone with a low battery. The option of having one port for 1.0 A and one for 2.1 Amps<br />is great so you can charge a phone and tablet at the same time. The whopping 10,000 mAh ensures multiple full charges.<br /><br />~ Jump starting your vehicle with this is straight forward:<br />1. Make sure the Jump starter is charged more than 25% (2 LED's lit on the power meter).<br />2. Plug in Alligator Cable to the jump starter.<br />3. Connect the red cable to the Positive (+) pole on the car battery.<br />4. Connect the black cable to the Negative (-) pole on the car battery.<br />5. After a few seconds try to start your car. When it starts, promptly disconnect the jump starter<br />  and leave the engine on for a couple of minutes to charge the battery.<br /><br />The Jump starter package includes a wall charger and a car charger for multiple charging options,<br />and includes a sturdy slim case for added protection. The case is small enough for easy storage in<br />the glove box, center console or trunk.<br /><br />I was provided with this product in order to write an honest review, and I certainly love it!
B001GEM9BM|3|Bunched & crooked seams---mirror pockets fitted too far rearward---poor quality control. This is my third Covercraft Weathershield but I will try another brand the next time. This is NOT $450.00 worth of car cover. Great fabric----Sloppy workmanship.
B0075ABS0E|3|Wouldn't buy it again. Ended up paying over $220 cause it was shipped to Canada
B000IYCAPQ|1|Wrong one
B00CCSD6CW|1|Not easy to use and I work with vinyl and digital graphics. It is a brittle film and will not adhere to complex shapes or contours. If you have flat headlights you will be fine. Nowadays though that is rare, most vehicles have odd shaped headlights. The film itself is easy to remove from the lights and I can only imagine would last for a fair amount of time. I tried both wet and dry applications and no luck so mark my words.
B00P1JFWVM|1|Buy it and rgret it !!
B0026M9BDC|5|Awesome works great on my 96 impala
B00DYR03QM|5|Works perfectly!
B007S0LDME|5|Ok. I can't believe I am writing about this. However, I have been an avid camper for several years and have just settled for the local &#34;bio pouch&#34; drop-in products from the local big box store. After my last long trip, I dumped my black tank only to discover its contents had not fully broken down and had not completely emptied.  Furthermore,  I could smell a combination of bio chem and waste. once again, my meter lights indicated I was not fully empty. So frustrating!  I had enough!<br /><br />I jumped on Amazon and started looking for best reviewed products and found this. Out of desperation,  I bought it. My first application was 3 scoops into the black with several gallons of fresh water. Within an hour the smell was completely gone!!!!  (yesssss!!!!!) I let it sit for several days and then went on another trip. When I dumped the tank I noticed everything had broken down to liquid. No paper, no other 'contents'......all had been liquified.  And still no smell!<br /><br />So, in closing, I'm done with the bio packs. I keep this product under the bathroom sink in my rig and use it on every outing. I couldn't be happier. I have always dumped tanks after EVERY trip.  My bathroom smells like it did when it was new! I'm thrilled!
B00776H0RG|5|no more leaks
B00J0ABS5M|5|Exactly as advertised.
B00DPYAGVG|4|It was hard to put it on, but I got it on with no problem. I love this decal!
B00TJD0ZW2|5|We've been using our EVSE from ClipperCreek for about 3 weeks.  It was very easy to locate and install (we had it installed by an electrician).  It is installed outside (under the eaves of the house), and feels very sturdy and well built. In my opinion, the 25' length on the cord is a must have because it gives you maximum flexibility on where you can install the unit and where you can park your EV.  So far so good.
B0032J1KAK|5|This little mirror is well made and installed very sturdy. You can easily fine tune the adjustment after installation. On the left side of the car, if I can't see a vehicle out the window it will definitely be visible in the spot mirror. A great little mirror. The only thing better would be one that is made into the OEM mirror.
B004M8KW90|5|Not much to say on this, other than it's working as intended, and has not discolored from extreme heat.  Fit was nice and snug, even before tightening the hold down clamp.
B00JPJY3Z0|5|should be standard in all new vehicle's instead of the ones the dealers what to sell you would recommend if u want a good floor mat at a good price
B00EHIPQ1E|4|I like that the lights are bright I like the color.. Just in thing bothers us.. If we turn on the car and don't turn on the lights right away they flicker for a while and the turn off, and if we try to turn on they won't unless we turn car off and on again. Sometimes only one light will turn on and we kinda have to play with the switch until both are on. Most of the time they work fine.. I'm just wondering whether it has something to do with my car or I just got a defective product.
B00AQ2D4C8|1|It was too small so I sent it back 9 days ago and they say they will give me a refund when they get the product back... I'll change my rating when I get my refund
B00EHIPTCK|5|Great product, perfect fit and well made kit.  I will be purchasing more in the future from this company, that's for sure!
B001CF1A7O|4|Solid product and I am satisfied but it's coated with a black powdercoat not a zink coating as advertised. Call it what it is.
B00B1WBPMI|4|The picture came out, outstanding!! However the quote/message in the back missed one letter, other than that the item was wonderful.
B001D566IG|5|fits my xterra
B001D20X4W|5|works great - price great
B003LFK6PK|3|The bed cover is good, no complaints there but BakFlip's customer service is horrible.<br />The details:<br />I bought a BakFlip bed cover with the rack option a while back and I installed the bed cover right away but didn't have the need for the rack until recently. When I went to install it I found the kit was missing the four angle brackets and the four end caps for the extruded cross rails on the rack.<br /><br />I contacted BakFlip about the missing parts and after several calls and emails between us I'll sum it up by saying that their customer service is bad enough that I'll never buy another one of their products.  The four brackets and end caps are worth maybe $10 in material cost and I even offered to buy them from BakFlip even though they were owed to me.  No return phone calls, no return emails, no dice.
B00IN5X2P4|4|does the job, satisfied, bought it for a friend too.
B00LCBLRHG|5|Worked like a charm. I'd buy another set if I need to.
B002Y20KWA|2|Looked good even though it wasn't what I was expecting.  It fell apart after less than month with nothing but my key fob on it......so I can only imagine what would happen if I had other keys on it.  Just as one customer said.....impossible to put back together with some special tool. Definitely not worth the price.
B001N729FS|5|Works perfectly!
B00CO7A7BO|5|really good product, i am very happy whit this.
B00T9GC59U|5|Great product
B007IJ1YCO|5|I love the fit and function of this bra!  I was on a trip with my wing and someone threw a plastic cup out of their car.  It ended up hitting off of the front of the bike and scratching the windshield.  I should've bought it before it happened.  It saves a lot from scratches and bugs on the front.  I love the way it looks too.  Easy to put on and I would definitely buy it again.
B000F14B7C|5|Good product
B0013DU47M|4|what i wanted
B00AWNVW52|5|The chrome plating chipped of original & this was a perfect fit for replacement & cheaper than any dealer/parts store could offer. I also received it quicker than the stores could've gotten it for me.
B006H3HF02|1|Don't get it.  Go with Bilstein.
B0087NB23Q|5|Works perfect for full face helmets. Great reception for MP3 Bluetooth along with communication between headsets. Easy to use. Great value.
B00FFJ8AOO|5|Doors fit nice, makes the rzr feel more enclosed and comfortable (safer), as opposed to having your knee stuck out for a stick to grab.
B001JT5NIU|5|Paying attention to what it's best for, it may not be best for sound deadening inside doors and such, but it definitely deadens the noise coming from the road in my Jeep. It also knocked down the heat coming in from the transmission as well.<br /><br />Definitely get a roller to put it down, as it works awesomely to keep it smooth. You can also use the roller in other ways, so it's a good tool to have.<br /><br />It's an awesome setup for a Jeep, I'm sure it would be great for vehicles with less noise & heat too.
B00MJ44V1E|2|Front vent not fit properly.
B00MAURPZ6|5|good
B00CLSWSZO|5|Works well.
B00MMORR80|5|Work great had to modify the slots where the bar mounts and make them bigger but they fit great look good and are very reasonable on price
B00JJ1US44|5|I am most happy with this hitch.  It fit my 2007 Honda Rubicon almost perfectly.  The hole alignment was not absolutely perfect but all it took was a little persuasion with my hands only (no tools) and it eventually slid over all the studs.  This is a full blown 2&#34; receiver that will fit anything you would normally expect it to.  It came with new low profile nuts, there was no modifications or extra parts needed.  This is SO much better than the hitch I had that was just a single bolt through the existing hole, it would never stay tight.
B004YMRIC8|4|Works pretty well unless you have tight gaps on your wheels like on some of the M sport BMWs (and I mean tight enough that you can't get your pinky through them). I can still use the small one with some effort to clean where I need though, and these get behind the spokes pretty nicely.
B000C7S2KG|5|perfect ,easy install.
B00BNITKC2|5|Received promptly.  Fully charged. Just what I wanted. Thanks.
B0054U3NMS|2|Was very slow to connect, sometimes didn't connect at all.
B007VA6JNE|5|Needed a 1/2 spacer to fit this product right up to the hub of the jeep wheel. Once my husband did this, no one can get any tool in to remove this or the wheel now. It does stick out about 1/2 inch, but the wheel cover stretches over it so it looks just fine from the rear where it slightly sticks out from the wheel.
B00HZBE3DW|5|Nice sticker for price definitely worth the money
B000G76PLA|3|It's very strong, but does not stretch as much as I expected - goes from aprox. 7&#34; to max of 10&#34;.  This limits applications.
B00NO8G8NS|5|Great fit and finish. Worth the money
B00BKEYBEQ|4|This product worked very well and as advertised. Got rid of wax residue. Renewed the black plastic to a healthy sheen. $25 for a 4 oz. bottle seems steep. That's why I didn't give it 5 stars.
B004FXMGLY|5|AMAZING
B00412UIPA|4|works great
B000C19DGY|5|Works great as described .
B001JT5TQQ|5|This item provided exactly what I needed. I wanted a compass for my bicycle (not my car).  To reduce the effects of metal handle bars close to the compass, the mounting bracket I used is plastic (see the pictures) The result is a simple compass arrangement that works perfectly for bicycle. Testing it: I know exactly where the sun comes up at 29 degrees latitude (at my home in Florida) and confirmed that the compass showed that too and it was spot on).  I had researched commercially available compasses for bicycles and NONE I could find came near the quality of this solution. Hope this might help anyone interested in adding a good directional solution to their bicycle so pass this along to anyone you know that might be interested. Be safe and have fun.
B001BC0BXC|1|not all the bulbs fit into place, also it did not come with the LED conversion harness
B000F5HVNY|1|An unexpected feature of this tank is the date code that reads 05/11 when I purchased it 08/15.
B003YJJS2U|4|Works, but very snug on standard electric tongue jack.  Decent for the money
B000BUQODG|3|Nice cover for a cheap option.  I bought this less than 2 years ago and the dessert sun has done it in already.
B009DJU5WM|1|These are junk.  Thay just fall apart.  I had to do the job multiple times until I finally figured it out and went and bought one from Autozone.
B000JFHNG0|5|gauges worked great as good as some twice their cost!
B009M3PQFA|5|this thing is awsome
B00GBQ740Q|5|Awesome product! Like usually!
B00PKRK7DS|1|Cooler leaked on the first use... Not pleased with a floor board of water in my car :(
B00BXMRP4I|4|Good
B00JC6UXR8|1|I received a black one.  When I called the company they told me I have to shake it really good.  I did, its black!  Now my canteen colored vehicle has black spots on it.  I would have preferred the scratches!
B00WH6M79W|2|Came as a pair but one side doesn't fit.......defect......good looking product on one side
B000P72GM8|5|Great clay to remove paint overspray. After removing overspray polishing was needed to remove light scratching from clay. Great results!
B00KJGPQE0|5|great product.. perfect fit and easy installation.
B00ARJQBXO|4|This COP works well as the miss fire problem is gone.  The only thing for me is the rubber looks of a cheaper quality and the top lip on the boot does not cover the engine opening completely.  There is a little bit of a gap, where the factory boot has a lip that curves down and completely seals the hole.  So far the engine sounds and runs great again.
B001EMDS4S|5|Product as described and works as it should.
B005C5EFAO|4|no hard but not simple to install...a must have accessory
B00YML13OU|5|These magnets are a good quality and a perfect size They are truly one piece, not like a top and bottom piece that will pull apart. They reflect very well and are very bright. They stay on the car well and remove easily after the lesson! They are perfect for letting other drivers know there's a new driver behind the wheel. I received these magnets free for review purposes, but my opinions are my own.
B00U7B3KXG|1|Guys it's not what you think it's so small and doesn't bring master link not or a pit bike maybe smaller does not fit for some 70 cc bikes
B00UCIT7HC|4|For the price the lights are fabulous!!! Mounted them as backup lights on my logging truck. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the brackets broke the 1st day. However I'm sure 12 miles of haul roads with 80000 lbs was probably not on the design agenda. The lights are very bright and I love them. I will be buying more.
B00W81S164|5|good
B0020SYY3O|5|I bought this specifically to monitor the tires on my ATV's and my riding lawn motor and it works great!.  Regular tire gauge's just are not reliable at such low PSI's so this item was worth the expense to purchase to try it out.  Works great, easy to use and read.  Very much recommend it for tires that are inflated with low PSI.
B002I0GYZU|5|THANKS
B00062Z5OS|5|excellent product and service
B000EQTSSA|5|Good
B004E3D66E|5|not sure why my wrangler keeps burning these switches up but easy to change
B0089RSXS2|5|Did what it was suppose to.
B001TR2F9M|5|Works well for cleaning rough stucco.  I used concentrated oxyclean and this brush on a cordless drill.  The results were good.
B00QHKDVD0|5|These are comfortable and high quality.
B00QQX7MY2|5|Love it.
B0041UAMCG|1|Horrible product, does not fit properly, light burnt out in less then two days then had to rebuy and replace. product had scratches.
B002ZI18PG|5|Great Item!!!
B000BYD3A4|5|Working great for my 1999 XJ. No issues at all.
B0002Q7BYU|5|Worked prefect on my 87 gmc Jimmy  (full size). Plugged in behind the rear bumper and put ground to the frame.
B000C9LA08|5|worked great
B00BAZ3YX4|5|Shipped quickly, exactly what was described
B00IOXQHRK|5|they look awesome thanks
B000YE585E|1|This does not fit the front of my 1997 honda civic it is way to big do not buy this product if your trying to replace a front wheel bearing in a EJ6 honda
B00MOR4D5U|5|These lights were super easy to install and brighter than I thought they would be. After 4 months, one of the bulbs went out. I contacted them via email and they sent us a replacement bulb right away. Their customer service far exceeded my expectations. I would definitely purchase from this retailer again.
B000GV6SK4|5|Great product,and delivered before promised delivery date.
B0047ECW56|5|Great solid product, Holds the hood down and eliminates hood buffeting
B00LVTVOUY|4|Great cover and very durable. Price was excellent and received it quickly.
B001HBUW1I|5|was very pleased with the quality of material. just took a few minutes to install and was able to adjust the 90 degree fitting to my needs.
B00BCRMAAS|1|Its not for honda pilot
B000VKPRYI|5|Went right in and works great.
B000MS830E|5|Top of the line as batteries go.  Good price
B000X20CB2|5|Very pleased!
B00AUIAWU0|5|Very impressed with the form and function of this creeper.  Looks like it will last forever.
B00A8MZ7IA|4|Very nice towel
B00BV6DP2C|5|Hard to put in but this product works and looks great.
B000H961YI|4|Would have worked if battery held a full charge.  Used it on my BMW battery and it would not charge to 12.7 amps.  Only 12.  Not enough it seems, to start the car.  Boughtt a new batter, ccar worked like a charm.  Relativly Easy to use, just plug and it actually does the rest.  Would recommend. Didn't give it 5 starts because it didn't actually charge the battery.  But I am fairly sure it's the battery's fault not the charger.  Also it is all plastic (thus the lightweight) so build qualitys is good, not &#34;durable&#34;  use kit gloves with this device and it should last you a long time.
B00MU5X17M|5|Exactly what I needed ...easy install
B00WVJRGWS|4|Very Good Product! I was deciding between HIDs or the LED and I am glad a purchased the LED they are bright but not blinding and still have the blue hue like the HIDs.  It was a tight fit to get it in my CBR600rr but after some playing around with it, it fit nice and snug.  I am a satisfied customer! I would buy from OPT-7 again!!
B007L2JNT4|4|Excellent fit with OEM look and functionality! System improves visibility, I could now see vehicles close behind me, with driver side better than passenger as others have noted. All-in-all no complaints with one exception which likely will not affect most buyers, but worth noting as I wish that I would had known ahead of time in order to take steps to prevent (see below), I plan on alerting manufacture.<br /><br />NOTE: IF YOU HAVE 3M CLEAR BRA (PAINTED MIRRORS) ONLY, the rubber type material used on the inside of the FIT System to prevent scratching factory mirrors had some sort of chemical reaction with the clear bra, bonded itself, making it difficult to remove mirrors by sticking to the point when I removed the Fit System the rubber strip stuck to the bra...came off the Fit System. It took over an hour using rubbing alcohol to remove the strip from OEM mirrors and distorted the clear bra...no it wasn't the alcohol as you can see exactly where the strip was. The rubber strip on the bottom lower portion that comes in contact with &#34;pebble plastic&#34; (non-painted) did not stick.
B00JGRB3H2|1|This gets one star not because of the product, but Amazons web page. Why would you have a completely different unit for a different cycle on the same page where it looks like you are simply choosing between a silver and a black color. Suzuki drz400 is water cooled and needs a water sensor thermostat.  The unit we received is for an air cooled Honda. Duh! What the *$#&*? Double Check your application as  you might be getting a different unit, not just a different color. Of course you won't know this until it's 90% installed and too late to return. Otherwise don't waste your time with the cheapo plastic mount included. Buy or make a metal bracket unless you like to do things twice.
B00EZYLIM6|4|Red wire (on the light) should be connected to the black (power) wire on the RV. The black wire (on the light) attaches to the white wire on the RV (the common wire). Usable housing but had to drill 4 new holes. No problem, it covered the holes of the previous light. Recommend filling all holes with clear silicon to prevent water from entering the RV.
B002305A1E|5|Solid! ! Good buy and very sturdy for the price.
B010JRGD86|5|Stylish and easy to install. Quick shipping too!
B007P727UC|2|Let me start off by saying this is nothing against the seller, they shipped very quickly.<br /><br />After 450 miles commuting back and forth to work (6 days) the water pump failed, and started leaking out of the weep hole. This was the ONLY time I have never bought an OEM part, for something that is not easily accessible. So to had to take today off work, tear the whole car down and replace the pump with an OEM pump. I did however leave the timing belt and idler in there, along with all the seals. Just remember, you get what you pay for! The OEM water pump cost more than the whole kit.
B001NND4VA|5|This mirror is exactly the same as the one I broke and fits perfectly as the longacre mirrors always do.
B00BJMSM94|5|Great OEM purge valve.  Unfortunately I could not find a YouTube video for this particular model, but the after some fiddling, the valve was replaced and the terrible stalls after filling gas are gone, gone, gone.  My wife was driving me crazy with all her complaints, and this little piece of wonder has at last brought peace to our home.  This is probably not the best price I could have gotten, but it was good enough, and the part was sent directly from South Korea, the motherland of Hyundai cars.  No complaints here.
B00DYPA0VC|5|They work great
B00GD8OL62|4|These lights look amazing for being halogen! By far the closest to HID I have seen from a halogen bulb. They are not as bright as HID but you can't expect them to be. Time will tell how long they last, but if you're looking for the HID look without the expense then get these
B000KYYIDQ|5|good
B00HXC7UII|5|BRIGHT! If using it on the street, pick yourself up a Skene Dimmer so you don't burn retinas of other drivers!!
B00CPOBGD4|5|just what i needed
B00UW4DNEO|5|this product is a nessesity.  For every car you own!  Get several jumps from one charge.  Small, light weight.  It's nice to know my wife and daughter can jump start a car with out help from any creep!!
B000E4B7JK|5|It fit my 1995 s10 blazer perfect
B00DRA4470|5|Good product. Takes about 20 minutes to install for one wheel but it's worth it. Great for looks and more importantly being seen at night. Only time will tell how it stands up.
B00495WMB2|5|I always buy brand names so. I know the parts are good
B00BQWQLOK|5|great
B000CPI5YG|4|ok
B00CS7ET9Q|2|Quality wasn't as good as I expected, but it'll do till I find another one.
B001N2O3PM|2|There were no screws- which makes it inconvenient to install. Still haven't put it on because of this.
B00LCBKDNA|5|perfect fit!!
B00KC37J0O|5|Perfect fit, exact color ordered and sent in a very timely manner. Very pleased with purchase
B000GKB0GC|1|If I could, this would be Zero stars instead of 1. Its slightly smaller making it hard fixing on my older Highlander. Doesn't fix well at all. You need to tie the back and sides with strong string or cord. Which wasn't informed on order info. After a month of using this, it is Ripping in the middle!!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
B004GC5DTG|5|Arrived on time good quality product and was far cheaper than bmw part.
B003RZ7YD6|5|Loved it so much that I bought it three times just to have replacements for my car they weather well I had the last one on my car for two years and never faded
B000IYU1DY|5|solid product.. not installed. Does not have the starter lug that some may want for a positive cable.
B0029TQDLA|5|This is excellent to keep your handicap placard safe from the sun etc.
B00KXBNYF4|5|Looks and Works exactly like the factory remote. The directions to program it are confusing and incorrect. Get a better source online to reprogram.
B00TXQLYPM|5|Great product, would buy again! Easy to apply, comes on clean. Seller is great, the original decal was black and hard to see... asked seller if they had one in white and emailed me back the same day that they could make one and mailed it out same day - I got it less than a week later! Looks great on the back of the car, and stays on! If you are looking for a good product, and great customer service, with fast shipping times, these are your go to people. I will definitely purchase from them again.
B000AMSC26|5|Great deal,saved almost 50 % to store price,fast shipping
B002KCE6LU|5|Best air tool I've ever owned!
B00WQKUMYQ|1|These are definitely not OEM. My OEM emblem is solid metal, these are plastic. Also they do not sit flush to the face of the rim, the rest a noticeably shallow but inexperienced eyes probably cant discern the difference.
B00H58W59Y|5|Like the socket end, easy removal using drive handle.
B00LXJTUM6|5|Love the frame. We actually had one already, but some @#&! at Lowes left there flat cart go down thru the parking lot and it smashed into my back bumper smack into the license plate.  Unfortunately, the pitty frame didn't make it, but I wouldn't have expected it to survive that.  It is holding up well, not fading and I love the message in support of my pitty & all other pitties out there.  And a great price!
B0004ELKC4|1|OVERRATED, does not perform as indicated. :-/  spend your money on something else.
B004JMEC0E|5|I use this stuff on my Total Chaos control arm bushings.  This stuff has eliminated any bushing squeak I used to get with Total Chaos recommended brand of synthetic lube.  It stays in place, super sticky stuff.  Order some latex gloves with this stuff if you don't already have some.
B0073XMXMK|5|Good reception! Car wash proof! Satisfied with performance!
B00LDOO1J8|5|Worked perfect, exactly the right dize
B00HN8BG6E|5|Works great, for e39's year 2000 to 2003 you cannot bake the headlamps to remove the lenses you must go through the back side to replace.<br />I have done this without cutting any holes, the first lamp took me about 30 minutes the second about 15.<br />If you need instructions go to: http://www.bimmerforums.com/forum/showthread.php?1622291-2003-Sealed-Headlights-Adjuster-Replacement-(no-cutting)<br />These are for factory Xenons with Angel Eyes, they are not for factory Xenon without Angel Eyes as in 1997 to 1999 e39's.
B003S6M4Z2|5|Worked perfectly.
B00SRKGVP8|1|The package was missing hardware.  When we returned it, we had to pay the return postage.  Lame!!
B00AEEHIV6|4|I really don't know how good they are but they do look very much like the original that someone removed from my car wheel.  I will update when I do finally put them on. Oops, it does say Genuine BMW emblems so I would hope they look like the real thing.
B00JGJH8QU|3|Nice piece.  If you are going to use it for camping, does not really do much for analyzing the circuit, but hopefully does have some surge prevention.  Since I put it in  though I am seeing some ground alerts from surge protectors, and the camper plug does not fit in it perfectly.
B00M78820I|5|Super easy to set up and store. It works great for our 107deg temps in Dallas right now! It def helps keep the car at least 30 deg lower than if I didn't use it.
B00GU318FW|1|I received this item and it was wet and had air bubbles. The glue didn't work and it couldn't hold to the back windshield.
B0002LJQKW|5|work well!
B000Z0HVHA|4|Works great! Even better price
B000KKN8UY|5|Work well!
B000FGCYT4|5|Who doesn't love a high breathing, cleanable, reusable, performance air filter for their Harley? A better replacement for Harley's performance stage 1 filter which I found starting to disintegrate after 7 years and the bike was stored in the garage. You can't go wrong by installing this on your bike.
B004E3A7FC|5|After the blower in my 2004 Liberty decided to only work on 4 (full blast) I researched what to replace and came upon a link to this part. Found a video on youtube to see how to install it.. and within 20 minutes had a fully functioning blower again! (ps. I'm a girl with no experience what so ever working on cars). Very reasonable price... certainly saved myself a pretty penny replacing this myself.
B000IZ9S3C|5|Works great fit good easy to change. On a 1992 GMC.
B008B5X5GC|5|worked well
B0088BX0IM|5|High quality and works great.
B00EC0Z022|1|Does not fit the 2010 Ford Escape, mount clips are square, need to be round. Also ordered the alternative model, that's no good either.
B0054K1ZX2|5|just what i needed to finish the job!
B003CKNMXM|4|Product arrived promptly in appropriate shipping material. Bought it for future need. It is direct replacement for the one currently in 1986 Honda Rebel 250.
B00EDQ19EI|5|Works perfect. Just go check out the install video on youtube to make the install go smoother. Took about 30 minutes to do both sides.
B00MH4S4W8|1|I am not happy with this purchase. No instructions and after using it one weekend to charge my cellphone the on and off switch broke. I will try returning it for repair, replace or money back? The old saying &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; fits with this unit
B00C0EP7CU|5|Looks great...helmet sized!
B00GXY2SOI|1|Fake Reviews indeed.  Read them and you will see.  Please take the time to add your own one star reviews to offset the fake reviews.
B002GYOSII|5|The piece I needed for one of my TPMS sensors on my Altima that went bad. The dealership was trying to charge me $200 for just the part, so glad I found this online.
B00UB4899Y|5|good quality item, looks very durable and I expect it to last a long time. BUYER BEWARE: don't assume like I did that these come as a pair. This is a single clip. Most of these are sold as a pair, as you need two to hold down each floor mat. But read the description carefully (I didn't) and it never says this is a pair. So I ordered two, thinking I was getting two sets, and only received two clips. Not sure what the vendor is thinking, but I feel slightly ripped off. I'll give the clip 5 stars, but I don't feel happy about this transaction.
B00O4CV2B6|5|Well crafted American made Jeep keychain for an iconic American made vehicle, the Jeep. It's design is simple and understated which belies it's rugged quality.
B002SQ6V1Q|5|I like the features, works well
B009DJQDX2|5|Really good
B000EBO1AK|5|Love this grill gard. Fit perfectly and looks great. Would buy again.
B0024E6W02|5|worked great!  really like the clear end so I can see when my tanks are empty.
B00LOWSEY2|1|When I received the car tag the monogram was backwards. I have had many items monogrammed, but at no time were they backwards. I guess it would be okay if someone was looking at it through their rear view mirror.
B0081SQY1W|5|Just perfect!
B000VKRQA6|5|Perfect for 2002 Acura TL type S
B00020BM2S|5|Awesome code scanner, still working strong, no problems. Reads codes from OBD I and II.
B0002U1TX0|5|It gave the finish a deep luster...
B002MQCYO0|5|I've used many different cleaners before and I've never found one better. Just wish it wasn't so expensive. I guess you get what you pay for.
B006FUT05U|5|My 98 shines like new...Cars are meant to shine...
B001KOY57E|1|Had to return it as an American 2x is ALLOT bigger then where it was made, their 2x would fit my 11 year old niece. But it was very nice quality, really bummed it wouldn't fit.  I usually wear a 1x and thought the 2x would be good but it was too small for me.
B00HW1IQD8|5|Delivered on time and what i expected
B000OCBO1S|4|Its lock is perfect. The only bad thing is the connection of the tether and rubber cap worn out in no time. I lost the rubber cap preventing from the sand or dust getting to the lock. Now I put electrical tape to cover the lock hole everytime I use. And I put lubricating grease on the latch.
B0002UEOLO|5|Can really feel the difference in the throttle
B002SSIBJ4|4|We replaced a light fixture in our RV with it and are very pleased with the brightness of it.  I now want to replace all of them.  The only reason it didn't get a 5 star rating is because the hook up wires were backwards.  Minor problem because my husband knows wiring. I will purchase this product again.
B00D1CQVIY|5|Good wiring kit at a good price.
B000OUW7XE|5|this is a great tool worked as expected.
B00VVFO39W|5|Very simple and utilitarian design.  In order to install it you should have a journeyman level knowledge of electrical work.  Most likely you will need to buy a &#34;whip&#34; (like what is used to connect the outside AC compressor to its electrical circuit breaker) with the electrical wires already in it and wire it into 240 v fuse in the circuit breaker panel.  If the circuit breaker is full, then you will have to make space by &#34;doubling&#34; up with a double fuse circuit breaker for low volt electrical areas thus making room for the new bulky 240 fuse to be added in order to wire the box to.  The easiest way is to put the box very close to the circuit breaker panned like right under it, hopefully the circuit breaker is in a convenient spot...  The internal components are very simple electrical circuits, your mobile phone has fancier electrical components..... This is a good thing because simple and few parts means there are fewer things which could break or go wrong.  If you are going to have an electric vehicle for long term, then it is necessary to buy a level 2 charger like this.  If you own the house you live in then this is perfect.  If you rent or have to move a lot because you are in the military etc etc, then a charger with a plug would be more suitable.  Unless you have a dryer in the garage with the plug you can use, otherwise an electrician will be needed to wire it to the circuit breaker or to install a new 240 v plug.  There is a special screwdriver head in order to open the charger box which it comes with, remember to duct tape it to the box for safe keeping.
B007TVTHSO|3|Fast shipping and packaging. The part works fine, just kinda noisy. It makes a constant high pitch whistling that gets more intense with each ac fan speed setting.
B000GZXCIQ|5|I wanted to add something nice near the drive of the bike, (sprocket nuts) so I ordered these, just got them today, I was actually really really surprised that inside the thread it's heli coiled!!!!!! I'm so happy about that because as a cnc machinist for the ship builders at Northrop Grumman we use this type of thread. So I'm pleased with that, the color is georgous, I personally would buy again, and I tell you why as well, aluminum has the highest clamping pressure than any other material, but be warned NOT to tighten too tight!! I personally would do a high strength loctite and torque it by feel evenly with all six nuts, (remember not too tight!)
B009Z0ZXOY|4|Took a little &#34;shifting it around&#34; to get it to fit in the slot but it did finally go in. Had a few very small, minor cracks on the edges, but i didnt see them until i had it on. By then it was too late to send it back. But overall, it's a very nice shield. Clear, easy to see over and through. I wish i had gotten an 8&#34; instead but this one will do. i would recommend it as a fairly priced replacement shield.
B00JN0U4SQ|1|Had it for a few months and it's changing a brown colors and chipping on the sides. Not good quality at all
B00BD5GWDK|5|Like
B00FGXF2Y0|5|switches work great
B007LICJ0S|5|I love this plate bracket.  Sturdy and it looks cool.
B00XTA787Q|5|Easy to install and look great
B000TYQB2S|5|Right fit good part.
B001RLZ7S6|5|Fixed my #6 misfire problem.
B003M10WLG|5|It's good
B007Y0PNH4|2|The velcro thats holds up the upper tray with the dividers is not very strong at all.  If you put any thing in the divided section with the two smaller slots  the tray sags and the items in the two seperate sides slide under the divider.
B00C5RHTG4|5|Exactly like original.  Should have 2 people do the install to eliminate dropping glass.  Great replacement and I highly recommend.
B00G0OLUKY|3|i have a Tacoma 2015, this is compatible with the original
B00HFX38U4|5|This guage works fine and seems to be built  well so far.
B000CJ00EA|5|This tail gate cover is great. It only took 15 minutes to install. Hardest part is making it center on the tailgate which isn't even bad. Hardware was provided at least with my truck. It's durable, good looking, and covers the top of the tailgate well.
B00P057UIA|5|After losing my original valve caps, these were great replacements.
B009VOQ05U|5|Quality product. Great price.
B007QWEOS4|5|Love the lanyard
B00UTTD3A6|2|The supplied HID bulbs don't fit in the socket tightly. They'll wiggle out before you can install the headlight housing. The 35W HID's are not bright at all and to adjust/aim them is near impossible.<br />The housings themselves look nice and the original lowbeam bulb fits ok, loose but ok. The highbeam bulb lock mechanism has to be turned in order for the wiring to be attached.. You have to unscrew the lock ring and turn it so the bulb fits properly..
B004I16QLY|5|Came on time and was easy to install
B00A7CEXMW|5|Thank you it was a relief.
B000BKIGPU|5|Easy to put together.  Very sturdy creeper
B00I8Z7KW0|5|This fit my 2014 Tundra CrewMax...not much to review.
B00CASDZKC|1|Did not fit in my Subaru Foerester. Poor instructions
B00OO1MS8I|2|Returned .
B000ES9RSO|1|I received this product. it went bad in 2 months. i returned it to be rebuilt. I received the rebuilt and it was garbage. Not built correctly.Shorted out the main fuse on my car
B004OASVIA|5|Just what I was looking for
B004C6OBBC|5|Good quality for the best price
B00HG9R8DK|5|Worked perfectly.  2 solder less connectors and we were up and running. Perfect.
B0046BLGZW|4|I purchased these as a gift for my father. He really likes the mats. The only complaint is that they did not come with the materials to mount the floor mats to the floor of the truck, my dad had to purchase these separately. Without the mounts the mats slide around on the vinyl floorboard of his truck.
B001RBLDB6|5|Very accurate decal.  The boundaries and shapes and sizes of each island are true.  Highly recommend this item.
B000CB6D9Y|5|Just what I needed. Fast shipping too ,Thanks
B00CFBVAX8|5|Good Quality keep t at a good price
B00LWTT89C|5|Great stuff. Try spraying a light amount of soapy water on the surface to be tinted. This will allow you some play while tinting and it will evaporate  with the heat gun. Product held up well and was as described.
B008EEYWYE|5|Good quality at a good price.  I recommend this kit.
B000WK4CS4|5|came within a few days. I followed the instructions and it charged up nicely. Excellent battery. 2004 suzuki gsxr 1000
B004CMDDOC|5|I tried Bug Slide because of a recommendation by a friend that owns an auto body shop. It's great. My vehicle was dusty, having been outside when a light rain fell and then dust from the parking lot gathered on it. The Bug Slide went on easily by spraying it on the vehicle and wiping it further onto the car with a soft paper towel. I let it set for just a bit and buffed it off with a microfiber towel. Not only did the dusty mess come of cleanly, the bugs that were gathered onto the front of the hood, side mirrors and grill also were removed. My next excursion in the country again collected my vehicle's share of bugs but they were easily removed with a power washer, which never had done as good of a job before the use of Bug Slide.
B00MBWEOIO|5|Had some issues with the fit initially on one of the untis, so contacted WindFire who sent me a replacement with the little pads. Works great so far and no issues with the unit getting loose and coming out of the door.
B0006IX7WY|5|Quick Shipper, Product as Advertised.
B002QCT4AC|5|Great product!
B005GT6EZ0|5|After having watched a YouTube video demonstrating backing a boat in a slp I had to have one. I fact I ordered 3 , one each for my son- in-laws. This little tool is exactly the thing you need for letting you know which direction your prop is pointed. You could stick tape on the steering wheel but after you've spun it around a bit you have now idea which direction the boat will go till you slip it into gear, especially for those tight maneuvers. For our 27 foot cruiser the Rudder Position Indicator is an invaluable tool. The other two boats are wake boats for surfing so their props are in the middle of the hull. Again, they are happy to have this little device.
B00JS9IU1K|4|It's not exactly for a 05 like it said but it works after you expand the ends!!!
B008MISCLQ|5|Without a laboratory and not being a petroleum engineer it's hard to get past the marketing and tell one oil from another.  One person swears by this brand of oil and another person says that brand is crap.  My friend tells me that semi-synthetic oil is not good and other people, who seem to know what they are talking about, say that it's the only thing you should be running in your motorcycle.  Personally, I think that most name brand motorcycle oils are going to be good and hard to tell any difference between.<br /><br />I believe the correct viscosity car oil would be fine, but you do want to use 4 stroke motorcycle oil in motorcycles with wet clutches as the newer car oil has additives which will mess up your wet clutch.  There is also the issue of seals and O-rings which motorcycles have a lot of.<br /><br />I've purchased the 3 gallon packs of Actevo10/40 twice now and use it in all of my motorcycles.  I have a Suzuki DRZ 400, a Yamaha WR250R, a 1976 Honda CB 750, and a 1969 Honda Trail 90.  I used to use Yamalube, which I have never had a problem with, but it's quite a bit more expensive.<br /><br />My wet clutches work smoothly with the Actevo and don't complain even under heavy slipping on some of the steep trails around here.  The oil seems to hold up well with heat and still looks and feels good when I do my yearly oil changes.
B00XAX4B9A|4|The 'AlphaShades Car Windshield Sunshade' completely blocks out any sun and makes a significant difference in the overall temperature inside the car; however, the only problem is that it's not very easy to put in the windshield. Personally, I have to take each of the visors of my 2002 Honda Civic and stick them behind the rear view mirror to hold the sunshade in place; otherwise, it slips down. Plus, I also have to take the time to adjust the extra fabric (which is there to be more accommodating to different types of vehicles) so absolutely no light comes in. If one doesn't mind taking the extra time to adjust the sunshade, then this is a wonderful buy; definitely  worth the money. Maybe it'll get faster and/or easier to do as time goes by and I get used to it.
B006MIWA6Q|4|Happy with purchase
B00B0C7UDC|5|Kit worked nicely on 2010 F150 Lariat. Even contains caliper clips, rubber grommets and  little squeeze pouches of break grease. Bedded in nicely within ~ 300 miles with better than stock break performance. Dust about the same as stock breaks - I go easy on the breaks normally.<br />Packaging was something else - due to the weight of the rotors the cardboard boxes around them had been torn up and mangled in transport - one of the little squeeze packs had come open and leaked in the separate plastic bad containing the accessories. As the weight of each axle set is in a separate cartoon - one way to tackle the problem were double box the sets - which on the other hand would make it more expensive. Had it been necessary to return anything new cardboard boxes were needed. I couldn't see any damage that might have interfered with the intended function due to he torn boxes.
B00263GI78|1|Says it fits a PW80 but its about two inches longer than stock, so &#34;Fit&#34; must have a very broad definition.
B00BQWQLOU|3|There is nothing about these bulbs to get excited about.  They are no better, or worse for that matter, than the original bulbs that came in my 2012 Accord Coupe EX-L.  They're good bulbs, but they are not &#34;X-treme&#34; and the &#34;Up to 100% more light&#34; must be based on versus wax candles.  I suppose I am satisfied with their performance in a general sense, but not when I think about the marketing slogans.  I would not say I am &#34;X-tremely Satisfied.&#34;  Ehhhhh.....

B00B0C0TCQ|4|2012 Dodge R/T Max front Pad Set..  Packaging left a lot to be desired.  Box was tattered and held together by lots of Tape.  Luckly the rotors and pads were ok inside.

B0013LJ22C|1|the picture they show looks like the one that I have and it was not, no big deal so I sent it back it was to small. BUT!!!!!!! I was informed that I cut the plastic bag open they had to charge me $25.00 to replace that 0.10 cent plastic bag. I couldn't believe it. I tried to reason with them but no matter what I was charged $25.00 for a plastic bag from choppers cycle.<br />well if that's how they do business I don't none of it. no telling what they would charge if I had opened up a box!
