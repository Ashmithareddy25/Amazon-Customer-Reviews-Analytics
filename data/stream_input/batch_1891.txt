B0063IH60K|5.0|Yes, there are lots of ads to deal with but that's how the developers can offer it for free.  The game runs smoothly. I haven't seen any issues yet. Only downside:  I've not yet been able to find a &quot;clear score&quot; function for Vegas scoring.
B0022Y570K|5.0|Even my 7 and 13 year old daughters like the adverse musical styling. There is nothing in this cd that I don't lisen to.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved it because it was creative! I've loved all the books! They are so funny! I was on vacation driving in the car wondering what I should do . And I finished the book!
B006YC74E8|5.0|I know there are a lot of photo shop and photo editing programs and apps out there but this one is simple and easy to use.  It's free so it's worth a try.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|A cookbook, yes, but so much more.  The best way to use this book - and you need to be ready to be hands on - is as a primer not just on how to cook, but how to LEARN.  The bigger point of the book, I think, is to open up readers to the idea of relatively rapid skill acquisition, and to provide a method for doing it.<br /><br />It is not like any other cookbook on your shelf, or really any other book on your shelf.  There is not a \\"chapter\\" on \\"baking,\\" or \\"sauces,\\" or \\"poultry.\\"  You will learn how to do those things, yes, but in a logical way.  (If you want to just skip to the recipes, you can, but that's honestly like throwing away the banana and eating the peel.)  The author builds in success - you start with straightforward stuff that tastes great and is dead simple to prepare. The first few recipes are idiot proof but still very satisfying to prepare and eat.  One recipe build on another and you learn as you go ... in a couple of weeks, you will be able to julienne veggies and prepare venison sous vide.  No kidding.  You can buy this book in the morning, read 4 pages, shop for gear and ingredients before lunch, and prepare lamb osso buco tonight.  No kidding.<br /><br />The book is worth $20 just for the recipes, especially if you are paleo or slow-carbing, but that is only half of the book.  The rest of the really priceless stuff is thrown in for free.<br /><br />Best money I spent all year, hands down.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|If you are a snoozer, purchase this app.  It rings in the morning and gets louder and louder and it tries to prevent you from snoozing.  Definitely a great app for me since I have to get up at 530AM.
B001KPK6Q2|2.0|I'm so over her it makes me sick...she runs after men and when they get tired of her they dump her..then she writes a song about it or moves across the street from them. I think the only way she can write a song is when she's dumped
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I am always skeptical of major online shopping sites that are not in full desktop form because you can't see and explore as much - but this is pretty good!  And free!
B008ETOSYI|3.0|I waited so long to rent this movie and eventually bought it. I would say it is a nice movie and I can watch it again. A soldier seeks out  a woman he that saved his life just from finding her photo in the war. He finds this woman and wants to tell her how and why he is there but can't find the words and eventually she finds out about him. Misunderstandings happen and eventually they find each other again.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Fun and very good making time fly by, though don't enjoy how most of the better items you have to buy.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|The only thing I liked about this movie besides all the special effects was Charlene Thezon's character of the queen. She played the part so well of being so evil to the core. She is by far an exceptional actress.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Bought this game as a Christmas present for my sister.  We played it the day of Christmas, and it is seriously an incredibly fun game! :)
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I enjoyed this movie more than I expected.  I love Mark Wahlberg as an actor!  If you are in the mood for a silly movie (although kinda raunchy at times....who would have thought a teddy bear could be so raunchy!) with lots of laughs, check this one out.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|love this movie, very good for anyone, especially a family movie night, deserves 5 stars.  Movie was shipped quickly and was just as described, recommend this movie and seller.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|This author just gets better and better. All of her books are moving, original, funny, and sensual. But most of all intelligent. Her characters are original and flawed, likeable and human. Her plots are intricate but not overly so and secondary characters are important and definitely add to the storyline as well as the main character's development,ie. Robert's parents (one of whom is dead) and Minnie's father and her friend Lydia. I haven't come across too many current authors who can compare to Mary Jo Putney in their ability to weave a plot,a romance and have such well developed characters but Courtney Milan is one who can. So if you liked MJP and you haven't read Courney Milan yet, you have a great backlist to glom. I do suggest reading her series' in order.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|An amazingly smart investigative story.  I could not put the book down.  This is a must read for for those who like mystery novels.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|I bought this because the movie got such good reviews and I like Tom Hanks. I haven't seen the flick and some reviewers suggested reading the book first, but its so disjointed that I can't follow it. So far I have seen three &#34;lives&#34; that don't make sense and I'm about to give up. I have several other books waiting to be read that sound much more interesting!
B00846REIS|5.0|At first I thought it seemed too similar to the 50 Shades Trilogy and quite frankly, I was disappointed.... Then I continued to read it and realized it was much more. Personally, I loved e 50 Shades Trilogy, however, this seemed more realistic and much easier to relate to. It's a wonderful book and I'd encourage every girl to read it!
B00005JMCN|5.0|I wish we had DVD's when I was a kid! I could have watched this one 100 times! As an adult I have a decent collection of horse movies, and always rent them when they come out (even the really corny ones). Compared to Secretariat, this one has a much better grasp on horse racing reality and a really swell period atmosphere of the 30's that I really loved. I especially liked the radio annoucer at the track. He should have gotten an Oscar.
B001R55VWE|5.0|I found this film to be excellent.  Cate Blanchette acted well in this film; I really enjoyed her.  I thought the subject matter was quite interesting.  The film was also suspenseful and I like that.  It is worth seeing more than once.
B00992CF6W|5.0|if you download a little app called 4-shared its free! I love it ... the only negative is the Icon is blurry. in my opinion a crisp Icon isn't worth 6.99 but that's just me!!!
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I loved this film.  I like the genre Adventure Legend.  The acting was superb.  I would definitely see this film again.  See more at vyctoryab dot wix dot com slash xplr.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|A contrived piece of writing with very little mystery or suspense and a largely predictable outcome. A disappointing novel from a great author.
B002L5EA4O|2.0|I found this film to be cute.  It was also entertaining.  I like Robert Redford and that is primarily why I saw the film.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was awesome and interesting, I couldn't put it down and I'm looking forward to read all the rest of them.
B007Z9QWVK|2.0|I found this film to be interesting.  It is not the best film I have ever seen but I enjoyed it somewhat.  It seems to belong to the category of film art.  I think it is worth seeing once.
B009A9BEHU|5.0|Buy this you will love it. It shows how truly incredible this band is and how they are loved world wide.
B008HK3XU4|1.0|I ordered the Marware Vibe Standing Case for my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; in purple.  This case was too big.  I had to return case and order a different one.  I really wanted the purple.  Very upset!!!!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Highly additive little game here. Have to find the right balance between infectious level and lethality. Nice to play a thinking game for once.
B004QX07G4|3.0|Everything I expect from Ellen. Funny, witty and warms your heart. Makes you feel you are ones of Ellen's girlfriends with very real dialogue versus narrative.
B005603236|4.0|A delightful adaptation of the novel; the actors were well-cast and the plot moved at a good pace, keeping one engaged 'til the very end.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am a hopeless romantic.  Made me feel hopeful and happy. Oh to meet a man as romantic as Christian Grey!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Again a very great book I have read this twice an cannot wait for the next one to come best book I have read in years
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I thought the book was very comical and realistic. The storyline is appropriate for a middle school child, but also creates a vibe of connection between the book pages and actual human beings.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved the book read it twice can't wait for the last one have since read more of days books
1451620829|2.0|As a musician briography, this is a page turner, independent of one likes or n ot what's written in it. It's open, has a lot of information. It is the most fact-full book of the thre official Kiss original members biographies released so far (Ace, Gene, Criss).<br /><br />But (and this is a big BUT) this is incredibly acrimonious towards the other member. Christ, by putting together all the official or not official books around about Kiss, it seems all the four original members, in one way or another, are obnoxious, despicable, dirty, horny, drunk, addicted, greedy, merciless, heartless, vain, manipulative, false people! It's getting a little bit tiring to read only negative things about Kiss members, and sadly a lot of those things are being wriiten/said by o member towards the others.<br /><br />The Peter Criss book is a funny one. It begins well, it gives a fairly good portrait of his formative years. Things go good until some years after they formed Kiss. Then, it's weird: Criss comes about as an egotistical, harsh, uneducated and abrasive man, a guy who treats women like garbage, who is spoiled and vain, who commits adultery as if it was the most normal thing in the world, who says it's all about the music but complains if he's earning less than someone, who blame the failure of its solo records on anyone but the music he himself wrote, who hates Gne and Paul with all his herat but proclaims to be a Catholic, etc, etc.<br /><br />He spends endless pages to describe with details if he could get an erection or not, if he was horny or not, if he could get it up or not, how many women he could get to his hotel room and get done, that Gene is a pig who doesnt's shower after the concert. He gives sordid and unecessary details, like Ace enjoying jerking off at every opportunity. Every lawyer he ever had was dishonest, incompetent, or both.<br /><br />Sometimes it really seems that he thinks he was the best musician and greatest star of Kiss. Go figure... He even says that Gene and Paul were responsible for the eventual demise, death or decay of Bill Aucoin, Mark St. John, Eric Carr, Sean Delaney, Vinnie Vincent, etc... Maybe Gene and Paul are the Antichrist in human form... And Gene and P\ul have a great sin: they work a lot for success...<br /><br />The grudge against his long time friend Ace Frehley came basically because, in one of the farewell tours, Ace told him he was making 40 thousand per show, and Criss was doing only... 30 thousand. But, like he said, it was always about the music... At least, both Ace and Peter still have something in common: contempt towards Tommy Thayer!<br /><br />The book ends with Peter apparently at a loss of what to do at this point of his life, after healing from breast cancer. I hope he finds his way.<br /><br />Like I said, I enjoyed the book. For flow of narrative, it's good., For the content inside, it's up to you to decide.that Gene and Paul were responsible for the eventual demise, death or decay of Bill Aucoin, Mark St. John, Eric Carr, Sean Delaney, Vinnie Vincent, etc...

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love how the team comes together and forms loyalties. Riordan always keeps things fun even in the darkest moments.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|I'm a big fan of stories about WWII and military aviation. Most entertain and inspire with tales of dogfights and close encounters with the dangers inherent in combat and struggles to stay airborne or make it home with severely damaged aircraft. 'A Higher Call' includes all of that; but, it is the human side of the story that makes it different. By the time we get to the actual encounter between Charlie and Franz we are fully invested in both of their personal stories and rooting for both of them. You would think the story would end at that point; but, the real story is how Franz and Charlie found each other years later. This is a great read; and gives new meaning to the word &#34;Honor&#34;.
B00272NH0Y|5.0|A Bigger Bang is no Tattoo, but it is pretty darn good. I will go out on a limb and call it their best since Undercover.
0316228532|2.0|I wanted to like this book, truly I did, unfortunately I was not able to.  I was not able to care about any of the characters.  I found the entire cast to be tiresome, annoying and wholly unsympathetic.  I understand an author wanting to create \\"real\\" people warts and all, but this bunch of characters seemed to have nothing but warts and lacked any endearing quirks, vulnerabilities, or other traits that makes you care what happens to them.  I was also disappointed in the style of the writing.  I expected to see some of the humor and charm the Harry series had, perhaps a Terry Pratchett-esque sense of humor peeking thru, but this was not to be.  I gave up  two thirds of the way thru and jumped to the end to see if the ending hinted at any reason for slogging thru the remainder of the book - it didn't.  It felt as if JK is trying to put out a book as far from Harry Potter as possible and in that I believe she succeeded.
B00005OAE6|5.0|if you like bob seger, this is one for your collection.  Great allbum.  just as good as any bob seger album
B0096Y6EUG|5.0|Very impressive -- long time Paul Simon fan, and these performances were excellent.  Since it was a NYC concert, the crowd was especially enthusiastic -- which may have improved his performance.
B005LAJ1O0|4.0|Why did Moira O'Hara age after her death? None of the other characters aged. And she became two characters of different age while other characters stayed at the age and level of maturity they were when they died.<br /><br />And everybody else kept their death wounds. Young Moira was shot through the right eye. Old Moira had that bum eye, but young Moira had both eyes.<br /><br />This is Really Important. Or not.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|I enjoyed all three of the Batman movies in this trilogy.  Though I believe the second movie was the strongest, this was a worthy conclusion, pulling together threads from the beginning of the story.  I found the ultraviolet copy useless.  You can't put the movie on iTunes or Amazon Instant Video.  I really don't want or need a third venue.
B006HAJ99K|5.0|Henry James was a brilliant author. This representation of his work lives up to his writing. It's incredibly well done. The cast superbly expresses the complex emotions that arise when love clashes with manipulation and values. While the costumes and settings are romantically period, the themes are timeless. You may easily find yourself relating to this one, then that one, and feeling their conflict. They are all so touchingly human that, while you may end up hating one in the end, you will completely identify with what happened and why. (I don't want to give it away). The best part is that this is one of those movies that grows with you. As you change, you see and feel different things. It never gets old. If you are in the mood for something romantic, timeless, emotional, and real, give Wings of the Dove a try.
0817439390|4.0|This well written book by Bryan Peterson covers how to shoot great images via understanding camera / lens settings & photographic techniques to acheive desired results.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Excellent Series, can't wait for the next Season 3 which is coming up very soon. I highly recommend to anyone to view it from the beginning.
0345803485|4.0|Good series, I just wanted to keep reading and reading. It is not a literary masterpiece or anything like that. Comparative to the Twilight series (minus) all the sci-fi aspect and add a bunch of naughty sex ..... I loved it!!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game is soothing and challenging at the same time.  Headphones are a real plus!  The soundtrack is unique and the graphics are stunning.
B007V65R54|4.0|The author comes off as very well-informed but humble, a rarity.  The book builds nicely and does not go on too long.  While not useful for a huge amount of people--that is, for those who do not specialize in predictions--it is helpful for all.  Especially for those who yell at tv meteorologists!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Another really good story from Pixar.  A little heavier storyline than previous Pixar films, but my three young sons really liked it.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|christopher nolan did another great job with this movie.  although packed with action really good story line as well. a definite keeper!
0345803485|5.0|I honestly could not wait to start reading Fifty shades of grey... It shipped quickly and was here within two days
1419702238|5.0|My 9-year old grandson loves ALL the Wimply Kid books.  He's not usually big on reading and prefers video games, so it's wonderful to see him enjoying some good literature.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I like both leads, the bear animation is well done, but Ted just isn't funny, I can remember two laughs in the whole film.
B003B02O7I|4.0|Unique background in South America.  Alcoholic gets cured in a epiphany-type of realization which is the main plot thread running through the story. .
B000AYEL6U|5.0|If, like me, you've loved this movie since seeing it on Netflix or Amazon's streaming service, you owe yourself the DVD version! Each episode contains just a few more lines of dialog, an extra half a scene here and there, but overall they make the movie so much clearer and add to the flow of the story. The \\"deleted scenes\\" includes an extended version of the proposal scene that I dearly wish they'd left in the full version, as it makes Margaret's reasoning much clearer as well. Yes, I've read the book, but this movie is so much better than the book that I'm just delighted to have an even more magnificent version of it. Worth every penny!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|So this may not be amazingly difficult at first but I don't need a total brain drain at the end of my day.  As it goes on I'm sure I will be more than challenged!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book is an emotional rollercoaster. Colleen Hoover was able to take a traumatic childhood and show how people work towards healing them. I have no words except to say the book is intense.
1419705849|5.0|My 9-year old grandson loves ALL the Wimpy Kid books!  He doesn't normally like to read that much...prefers video games, so it's awesome to see him reading for a change!
6305127638|5.0|If you are not a Trekkie, this great movie helps to explain why so many of us are.  It has all of the key ingredients.  Compelling character development presented by the exceptional cast, timeless themes that focus on big ideas and ideals, a great story, superior production values and a moving soundtrack.  It never gets old.  If you already are a Trekkie, then of course you know all of this.
0553386794|5.0|I tried watching the HBO series and promptly got well and truly lost - so many characters to keep straight, so many plots and subplots.  I started reading the books in order to sort it all out.  I am not totally hooked.  I will be reading the rest of the books ASAP and will be having a GAME OF THRONES marathon as soon as I get my hands on the dvds.<br /><br />As stated elsewhere this is the usual epic fantasy series premise, a quasi medieval setting for a struggle between good and evil.  What sets this series apart is the complexity of the world that GRRM has created.  There is a huge cast of characters who, rather than being united in a single quest, are instead focused on their own concerns - a mirror of the real world.  And, like the real world, the characters are not neatly defined as good or bad but are all a bit of both.  Unlike most fantasy adventures being one of the 'good guys' does not guarantee survival until the last page, nor even a heroic death, again like the real world.<br /><br />This is far more complex than most sword and sorcerer type books, the characters are better defined, interaction between the plots and subplots more complicated.  This is not a quick, easy read but it is well worth the effort needed to delve into this series.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love playing this game on my kindle.  I'm addicted and its so much fun!  I would recommend it to anyone who has some time to spare.
B000002MNR|5.0|Wonderful CD!  BEAUTIFUL!  Shows Marks instrumental genius!  The best guitar player ever!  Anyone who has enjoyed Mark through the years will be thrilled to hear the beautiful instrumental music on this CD!  You will not be disappointed!!
0316228532|5.0|Harry Potter - genious! Now with this story, I have to say she really is taking the reader into a different reality. She does have a way with words. A must read!!!
0811876373|4.0|Bought this for my DIL who likes picture books that are crafty.  She used one of the ideas to make cake pops for my granddaughter's PreK class.  It took her awhile to get the hang of them, but they turned out really cute.  She did say they were too sweet, however.  If you like to bake and you're into the new cake pops, I would recommend this book.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I use this on my Kindle Fire.  So far, no problems.  I have only seen single ad screens at the beginning of play, and not every time, either, so that's o.k.  Exactly what I expected it to be.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Great movie.  Definitely different from the Aliens movies, but has some cool tie-ins.  The one criticism that I think was valid is that the movie doesn't stand alone.  I really hope they make some sequels to address some of the plot points raised.
1451695195|4.0|the author being a nuerosurgeon brought a different perspective to this topic. i would reccomend to anyone interested in this subject.
1455502758|5.0|Shows man's true inner conflict as he fights for his life in a battle with cancer. Awe inspiring and mentally stimulating.
0896898288|5.0|received this book and read numerous letters throughout the book, have started from the front and made two blocks so far.  nice instructions and directions.
6305882592|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies and Cat Stevens did amazing on the music! Saw it for the first time 22 years ago and still a favorite.
0321885112|5.0|I've followed Mike Rohde on his blogs and on Twitter for some time now so when he announced he would be penning a book about sketchnoting I eagerly anticipated the release.<br /><br />In a nutshell, the Sketchnote Handbook is the who, what, when, where, why, and how of taking visual notes. Mike explains it all clearly and concisely using his great illustration and sketchnote style. And, to my pleasant surprise, Mike recruited several other prominent sketchnoters to include their work in the book as well. It's great to see a variety of styles in one book.<br /><br />Not only is this a great resource for learning how to take visual notes, but the material also applies to other areas as well. I don't go to many conferences, so I don't get the chance to take sketchnotes much except for the occasional webinar or TED talk video. However, I do use sketches a lot to capture ideas for projects, sketch out scripts and storyboards and to try to communicate ideas. The principles in the book apply perfectly to these disciplines as well.<br /><br />A fantastic resource that's bound to be a classic and belongs in every visual thinkers library.
B0076NAW48|5.0|I saw Chuck sitting in with The Roots on Jimmy Fallon recently and had totally forgotten about him.  I play piano, too, and  love blues, boogie woogie, etc.  A bit of a lot on this one!!  Chuck's a fabulous musician and this CD might slip thru the cracks if we're not careful.  I'm telling all my friends about it.  Have played it while quilting the past couple of weeks and really enjoy it!  This guy's so great!!  Even if you're not a blues fan, at least listen to the samples on Amazon.  You'll be hooked!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Much better than the film characters much more developed. Everything explained in detail that was just assumed in the movie
B007KOMTUI|5.0|This season did not deviate from the elements that have composed previous seasons. The writing is sharp, the characters well developed. It did seem that they were willing to stretch the boundaries this season more than in previous ones. One of the best shows on TV.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|For those of you on the fence about spending the money on the set, my experience has been great. I have listened to almost all of the discs and they are dead quiet with virtually no surface noise. The sound is incredible. I even compared the sound of PLEASE PLEASE ME to the remastered cd and I found I enjoyed it more. I am very satisfied with these discs and it has renewed my interest in the Beatles sound. A sound that all of us of a certain age only new on vinyl once.  I should say that I am using an excellent turntable that is well setup and vintage 1970 amp and speakers. I also listen to hundreds of other vinyl records, but very few soub<br />Nd as good as this
B005OZE9SA|5.0|Easily installed to my computer (Windows 7, 64bit)<br />Performs just as specified.<br />Great for starting out, has everything you need.<br />Headphone amp is absolutely awesome with my Audio Technica's.<br /><br />If you're looking for an audio interface to start off with, go with something as reliable as this. Focusrite has had nothing but good critics, and you're getting more than what you pay for.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|This was a good read. Altough I thought the ending seemed rushed and the epilogue light it still feelz moztly like a Clancy novel.
B0059DOJAA|5.0|I felt Edguy's last album wet heavy and lost the true feeling of edguy.  But this album brought back some quality classic edguy sound.
0307891372|5.0|LOVE this book! I use it as my personal assistant while playing! Has so much detail and makes me love the game even more! I highly recommend this to anyone whether you are a beginner or if you have played it from the beginning and have three characters (like me but I still found this extraordinarily helpful!)
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I have loved all of Rick Riordan's books since the very first Percy book came out.  This one did not disappoint.
B009ZFPQOQ|4.0|I would have given this product a 5 star except I have has a couple problems with directions.  Over all in common areas it is great and love the little extra's, makes it fun. If you are driving out in the country or trying to find a place that does not have much traffic the directions could be off. If I were better at giving imput to improve the system I would love helping.
B0011E7JBW|4.0|Not my type of movie, but it was funny. My husband liked it. we had never seen the series and were planning on watching MIB III on New Years.
0788859544|3.0|I order this movie and the saler said it was a new movie. It was a new movie but it was a copy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was an amazing way to end the series. I'm not a big  Peeta fan but it was still good. I love the way there I so much detail. I wish she ended up with Gale though.

B0094BB4TW|3.0|I use Facebook on my computer and phone, so I figured FB on my Kindle would be awesome. I have been a little frustrated though because I cannot see everything on my wall. I am not sure if it is just a setting or if that is normal, but it is frustrating.
B008OOYALE|3.0|cool updates but a limited edition elf egg just disappeared from my nest. Not sure how much longer I'm gonna put up with this.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|Special effects are top notch but other than that it is just Okay. i think it lacked the fresh humor of the original.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This was a great book. There were some really emotion provoking parts, but overall I enjoyed it. The way Hannah dropped subtle hints about her choice to commit suicide really make you look at the details in people. On each tape there was a different cause that helped Hannah be pushed off the edge. Thirteen Reasons Why has a message that anything you say or do can affect people in the long run. I would recommend this book to anyone older than 12.
B00992CF6W|1.0|it is the worst game I have ever played. there is no real reason why anyone should buy a game as messed up as this. also it is Very expensive.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|Fun to see how far I can get. I have a fear of heights and every time the cube falls I get weak knee-ed

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is exactly the sort of game that sucks me in. It's fun and engaging. It's also challenging without being impossible.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Exceeded my every expectation after watching season one. The story line was able to keep my attention for every second that someone or something wasn't getting eaten. Best suvival horror series ever.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|it this the start of the Alien?? . i couldnt really follow it. like i said i probably need to watch again.
B008Y2X78S|4.0|Boardwalk Season 2 has as many merits as Season 1. Always a plot unfolding before your eyes which may or may not go where you expect. Thoroughly believable for the times it reflects. Plenty of tough guys, corruption, sex scandals, etc. to maintain your interest.<br />If you purchase the series it's not likely that you'll be able to watch one episode at a time. You'll be hitting the &#34;next episode&#34;  button rather often before calling it a night.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|nice nice nice nice nice movie for the whole family bean its the men in this movie whoo hoooo hooo
B003YL4LYI|4.0|If you've read the 4th book, you know the first half of this one.  Because of the way he wrote the 4th and 5th books it becomes a recap of events that have already happened to the half of the people in the 4th book.  However, being a fan of the Dragon Queen, you do get much more in depth with her tale. Which makes all worth while
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Pretty cool even though I'm not into astrology. I still like to look at it . Could be a good fishing tool.
B007UW9VWO|5.0|The sounds, music is so creative, expressive and unlike any other film I've listened to (I am a Music Major) I thought based on the title, I was not so sure I would be interested but the fact that Jiro dreams of Sushi has one of the biggest \\"cult type\\"  followings ever  over seas it would worth more than just be another film about a guy and his dream...and it certainly is!  The rich layer of sounds on the blue ray DVD was absolutely mesmerizing.  Story line was surprising and found myself in the throws of emotion, excitement and looking forward to what was coming next  from beginning to end.  So, without going on too long, yes, this is hands down one of the best ever.  I have watched just about everything and now I know why it has such a huge following, this is in my Top Five films of all times!  For real, you will be glad you got it for you or someone else.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The information provided does not fit with my traditional Christian upbringing.  But strangely enough it fits well with my engineering/science background.  Lots to think about after reading the book!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Wonderful graphics.  Easy to play. Wide selection of characters, abilities potions and weapons to make your game personal. Plenty of evil to vanquish and even some zombies to destroy.

0761171703|5.0|This book puts me in great mood every time I open it. It is inspirational and I simply like it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun game lots to choose from. I would like it better if you could earn more points to buy more games.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Yes, the whole theme of the movie is about the big 'ol corrupt central government (Capitol City) but there were  no preachy political messages so the movies only real &#34;theme&#34; was about the transcendance of the human spirit over an unfair, corrupt system. I understand there are two more movies in this series to come out, so I hope the next two are as politically neutral as this one.
B003YUWLQE|5.0|I buy lots of Croc's here.  Since they are made in China you would think they would be cheaper in Asia.  You would be wrong.  Buy them here before you travel. Great show.

B008476HBM|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. When it was required reading in school and I totally disliked it. It's amazing how much I enjoyed it. I'll have to go revisit some more classics
1603427244|5.0|This book is wonderful. Gives great instructions written and visual. Takes the fear out of trying new methods. This is a must have book.
B006ISJQBC|2.0|At the time I read the book [[ASIN:B003H4I5EO London Boulevard]] by Ken Bruen, it was being filmed in Great Britain by William Monaghan, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of \\"The Departed,\\" who was making his directorial debut. (Monaghan also writes the screenplay for this British film.) LONDON BOULEVARD was not widely shown in American movie houses: it took me a while to find the dvd.  I wish I had just re-read the book.<br /><br />The story parodies the 1950 movie by Billy Wilder called \\"Sunset Boulevard.\\"  An ex-con leaves prison, doesn't want to return, and finds employment as a handyman with a reclusive actress who lives grandly in a large home.  Her only servant is a butler.  The ex-con soon shares gifts and other favors from his beautiful employer.<br /><br />The film is well cast. Colin Farrell plays the lead role of the ex-con Mitchell and Kiera Knightley the beautiful, but reclusive young actress. Beautiful people with not much chemistry...in the movie. Mitch spends his time shooing away the paparazzi. Anna Friel plays Michell's sister Briony. In the book she is slightly mad, a confirmed shoplifter, often forgetting her husband is dead. She arrives at Mitch's Welcome Home party \\"looking like a radiant bag lady\\" and apologizes for Frank's absence. In the film she is love-crazed and well-dressed...just another ditzy gal. David Thewlis plays an effete butler.  He wears wrinkled hippy-like clothes, rarely shaves and has long straggly hair.  Wonderful wit but not a bit like the proper and tuxedoed Max Von-something in \\"Sunset Boulevard.\\"  Thewlis plays a careless protector who mainly sits at a kitchen table smoking funny cigarettes and talking about his career as an actor. Ray Winstone has the plum role of the vicious crime boss Mr. Gant.  He constantly growls with murderous intent in the film. In the book a well-dressed Gant asks the well-dressed Mitch to a posh restaurant in Covent Garden to help him organize his debt collections and to steal Lillian's Silver Ghost Rolls-Royce.<br /><br />Although the funeral of Joe, Mitch's favorite newspaper seller, is somber here...it's out of control in the book. The only mourners, Mitch throws a copy of \\"Big Issue\\" on the lowering coffin and Briony invites a street musician dressed in kilts to play the bagpipes.<br /><br />Monahan would have done well to let Ken Bruen write the screenplay.  Bruen's characters are funny and quirky.  And he saves the violence for the end of the story.<br /><br />I should have watched the dvd with subtitles...did I miss the Bruen wit? And don't blink: you'll miss the grand vintage fancy cars....and the love scenes.ost Rolls-Royce.<br /><br />Although the funeral of Joe, Mitch's favorite newspaper seller, is somber here...it's out of control in the book.

B007N85ZXY|5.0|I don't normally bother reviewing records and books that have already clearly said most of what can be said about them (after 100-some-odd reviews), but in this case, what the heck. I'll be very brief.<br /><br />This is simply a wonderfully fun album. Crazy Horse is always a good time and generally I prefer my Neil with them rather than without them. The vibe here is infectious, goofy, irreverent and most assuredly no major statement to make. I suppose I understand some of the lower ratings here from folks who like their Neil folky, on key, or having BIG THINGS to say, well, too bad. While I can't put this in the same league as NY&CH's absolute best, neither can I bring myself to give it only an \\"I like it.\\" I have to give it an \\"I love it,\\" because, well, dang it, I do.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really liked this novel.  The author draws you into this suspenseful thriller.  It would have gotten 5 stars from me if it wasn't for the ending.  It wasn't satisfying given what you find out towards the last 3rd of the book.
B008VBYN80|5.0|good game really fun to play and addicting for me. I like the offline camp and online battles are fun
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is a great book, it kept me interested through all 800 and something pages. This isn't my usual type of book, I normally<br />read urban fantasy or paranormal romance this was an interesting change for me.  I'm going to start the 2nd book today.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Loved it from beginning to end! Couldn't stop reading. Can't wait to start the next one. I'm officially addicted to this series. Gideon Cross....oh my...
B005LAII1C|5.0|Very funny movie. This talking Teddy Bear is a hoot.  Makes you want a teddy bear that could talk.  I recommend this movie to any on who has a good sense of humor.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Great for bronies. However, it will take you YEARS to beat it unless you are willing to drop serious cash. The sheer greed of Gameloft is staggering. Also, the friend function is pretty much broken in the kindle version.<br /><br />So...play it casually.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This was a great deal and a huge hit for my daughter for Christmas!! It was great having them all in a box set!

B007L6VR6M|4.0|This is a great movie for those that have a dry sense of humor. Just as his older films, if you love Dumb and Dumber or watch two and half men.... you will probably hate this movie.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The soundtrack is amazing! I have not seen the movie yet but now I am even more excited! I would recommend this to all Music Lovers.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Not as good as the first few but I will hope the next will be better<br />..<br />I have hope the series will be entertaining.
0345529057|3.0|Although it was a great idea for a gift, this set arrived damaged. It wasn't obvious from the packaging, but book four's back cover was bent - no doubt from the printer.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Very cute movie! Well worth spending the money on a nice family movie! Highly recommend it to families to add to their collection.

B00008J2PG|5.0|Gregory Peck and Christopher Plummer both did an excellent job in this historical account of German occupied Rome.  It spawned great interest in reading up on the key players involved which all have much written about them and their historical significance.
B009O07NDY|5.0|First of all, it is a beautiful book-style embossed print case, with two CD sleeves and lovely illustrated accompanying booklet.<br /><br />There is also a free app that you can download the art too.<br /><br />Now the music, the music is fantastic. I loved hearing familiar pieces that tie it to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy while at the same time it is its own. It does justice to the story with its epic tone. Its not difficult to see the story in the music.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for lovers of Tolkien, the movies or just music lovers in general.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|If you love cats and love to laugh, you'll enjoy this quick read! A highly entertaining read that will leave you in a fit of giggles.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|What a great series in which the young Harry finds out more of his special thing(s) he is capable of doing.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Watching the movie in 3D brought all the familiar characters to life. The depth and color made it feel as though you were in the ocean swimming alongside them.
B005HV6Y84|3.0|Music was good, not something I would choose to listen to on a daily basis.  I pull it out every now and then because I can't remember what part of the movie the song played or I was trying to remember the words.
B000E1ZBFY|4.0|An excellent companion to the 2006 second part &#34;Karol: The Pope, the man&#34;.  Excellent acting.<br /><br />One of our favorites.  God Bless Blessed John Paul II!
0375869026|5.0|I bought this book as a present for my 12-year-old daughter based on a review from NPR regarding 2012's best \\"backseat reads.\\"  She opened it in the morning, disappeared into her bedroom, then emerged just after lunchtime having read the book cover-to-cover.  Based on her glowing recommendation, I picked up the book this morning, and also found myself reading it nonstop through completion.  What a wonderful novel for young and old alike.  The author brought great depth to the main character, and by the end you feel like Auggie is someone you grew up with and know well.  I found myself alternating between laughter and tears throughout the book, and by the end I felt like it was a few hours of my life very well spent.  I can't recommend this book enough!  I hope it helps bring more compassion, kindness, and caring into this world -- we sure could use it.
1451695195|3.0|Positive: Interesting and facinating story near death expedienses. Approach is professional<br />Negative or to be improved: Scientific and medical science jargon  is not easy to follow up by ordinary reader.<br />This makes reading laborious and slow.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I could hardly wait to see the first edition of the third season.  This one series that has you waiting till the next edition in the<br />series to see what is going to happen next.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This game seems to run rather slow. I would prefer if it would run much faster than it does now.
1423140591|4.0|Got it for my kid. Said he enjoys it very much, and has enjoyed the entire series. Nice work Rick.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Like everything about it other than it loaded a city I don't live in and it will not allow me to change it unless I add new location each and every time I open it.  Frustrating.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Another great book by Colleen Hoover! Hopeless was full of surprising twist, and a wonderful relationship between Holder and Sky! A must read!
1908117230|5.0|a lot more better than recipes found on the internet. very detailed instructions and nice photographs. i am happy for getting it
B003L77GH4|5.0|The second season started off just where the first stopped and is just as exciting as the first series.  Keep up the good work as this is a classic series.
B009G41CG2|3.0|I would have preferred the view shown above, which I believe is standard when asking for this review, instead of all the strange configurations.
B004SRWW0C|5.0|If you want access to the file system on your android device this is it.  I am using it on my kindle and it is awesome.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This  book is wonderful. I have to admit I only read it because of the upcoming Emma Watson movie, but this book really makes you think about things. I think the best way to read this book is to read one letter a day and be a \\"filter not a sponge\\". Then I think you can really take in this book the way Stephen Chbosky wanted us to.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|there is a free version if you have an android phone. still the $0.99 was well spent on this game and you get the fast forward option which comes in handy for some game modes. there is a slight issue where the world graph will claim that 100% of the world is infected when in fact there maybe quite a few uninfected left. just keep an eye on the blue heart Icon when that number reaches 0 you're good to go.
B008S4YZCO|3.0|It took about 20 minutes (and a lot of memory) to download and a few more minutes to install on my Kindle Fire HD, and after that long wait, I really wasn't overly impressed with the game. The graphics and characters are cute and unique  but the game itself isn't super fun. It is fine for burning time but that's the only reason I will keep it on my Kindle.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I fantastic series  in which I could hardly wait until next week to view the next edition of the series now I have the whole first season and I can view them when I want to see it again.
B003N3FVQE|5.0|Jeremy Brett (1933-95) is rightfully regarded as one of the best, if not at the top of the list, of the many actors who have played Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's iconic detective Sherlock Holmes, in movies or on television.  Between 1984 and 1994, Brett played Holmes in 41 adaptations of Doyle's original stories produced by Granada Television.<br /><br />Jeremy Brett fully immersed himself into the role of Holmes, and in the minds of many, brought the character to life, and made the role his own, becoming the quintessential Sherlock Holmes for the 1980's.  Particularly in the early adventures, Brett brings great energy, emotion, and a real sense of edginess to the character.  Brett was diagnosed as a manic depressive in 1986, and put on lithium.  The medication was a contributing factor in his noticeable weight gain in his later years.  And while Brett is still brilliant, at times he seems to lack some of the fire he had previously.<br /><br />Holmes' friend and companion doctor John Watson was played by David Burke, who was later replaced by Edward Hardwicke.  Rosalie Williams ably plays Mrs. Hudson, Holmes' housekeeper at 221B Baker Street, and Colin Jeavons appears as Inspector Lestrade from Scotland Yard.  The Granada dramatizations breathe life into Conan Doyle's stories, capturing a sense of the time period, and the prevailing social conventions.  Guest stars are often featured in significant roles, and the performances by these talented actors is usually excellent, rarely failing to meet the high standards set by Granada, and by the nature of what is generally regarded as classic material.<br /><br />Fans of Sherlock Holmes may have issues with some of the adaptations, which were developed for television by John Hawkesworth.  The episodes do not follow the same chronology as Conan Doyle's literary works, so there is a bit of a disconnect with the timeline.  Also John Watson's marriage, which happened quite early on, does not occur until much later.  Although the timing may not be perfect, the Holmes/Watson dynamic is familiar and well-established, and works with either Burke (13 episodes) or Hardwicke (28 episodes) in the role.  Although each actor has points in their favor, which makes the \\"better\\" Watson is a matter of individual taste.<br /><br />The Region 2 collection released by itv Studios in 2005 has an outer cardboard box that houses two large plastic cases, which each contain 8 DVD's.  The 16 disc set, includes The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1984-85, 13 episodes), The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes (1986-88, 13 episodes), The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1991-93, 9 episodes), and The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (1994, 6 episodes).  Image quality varies, and is sometimes a bit grainy, which was fairly typical for 80's television, but the colors are generally true, and nicely saturated.  The episodes are subtitled in English only.<br /><br />I purchased this Region 2 set at Amazon UK for about £20 including shipping, which at the time translated to about $33, which is well below the price at Amazon USA.  The entire series is also available in a Region 1 release by [[ASIN:B000RPCJB6 MPI]], which includes the same content, except on just 12 discs.  Currently priced at about $158, the MPI release also has some bonus content which is not included on the Region 2 release.  As I have a region free player, I was fine with buying the Region 2 set, passing up on the extras, and saving $125.  While the price has since gone up at Amazon UK, the Region 2 set remains a relative bargain, for those able to view Region 2 DVD's, and prefer to save some cash buying a no frills release.iming may not be perfect, the Holmes/Watson dynamic is familiar and well-established, and works with either Burke (13 episodes) or Hardwicke (28 episodes) in the role.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|I recommend this to anyone who wants to keep tabs on their weather or any weather at any location.  Great for traveling.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Bought the first one and buzzed through it in less than 24 hours. Yes there is a whole lot of dialouge but I just keep tapping the screen to get to the next quest. I didn't have any issues or problems with the game. So addicted that I bought this one as well. Hoping there will be a 3rd and 4th! Love hidden object games and this one not only has that but &quot;unscramble phrases&quot; and fix broken or torn objects/documents. Some things are hard to find but its definitely not so much a child's game. Adults can get stumped too....so I recommend this to anyone!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Great interplay in the item seeking scenes.<br />Good graphics and sounds. Lots if room to move around, but a bit slow going from scene to scene.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I rented the movie first and fell in love with it.  In filming there are two &#34;catches&#34; on the dvd, but overall- a really nice film on her early life.  Just an FYI- a few events, like in any movie, are a little off, but otherwise well done.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This movie was just as exciting as all the other ones and can't wait to view Pt 2 of the series.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of the fifty shades books! Couldnt put them down! I am now reading them for the third time!!!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|AMAZING!! I could not put this book down, I started reading this because I loved the Slammed series.  This book captured all my emotions with every turn of the page.  It was everything and more that I expected from Colleen Hoover!  Can't wait for more books by her!
B004FEL6GO|3.0|Our kid loved that Santa brought him this, but within 20 minutes of playing he'd already popped off the leg once. Eassy to get back on, but something I've had to do regularly since the parts get loose after a bit of play. On the good side, he's figured out how to transform it back and forth without any help within less than a day.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|This started as a very strange series but it had me hooked as each edition came out each week I was there to see it.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Interesting, weird characters, studies in neurotic pettinesses, and a telling examination of the British Children's Protective Services. I think a sequel is implied, if not a series.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|If you want to keep up with your ebay bids and watch lists this is a great app.  I definitely recommend it.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|A good story with wonderful British actors!  Maggie Smith is a favorite of mine, as is Judi Dench.  It also evokes the color & complexity of India as well as its bustling energy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Stayed up late every night not wanting to put this down. The first kiss buildup was so sensual it made me want to fall in love all over again. Great plot except a bit redundant towards the end. Overall good choice.
B001P3SA94|5.0|I appreciate how timely this arrived.  I was hoping it would arrive in time for Christmas and it did!  I am very pleased!
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|This is the first of many Bale will star in and we hope it will be for along time of Batman Movies.
0810979772|3.0|My son LOVES the series and was very excited to receive it but was very disappointed to see scribble in it.  We went through and crossed out or erased whatever we could but that should be something done before we bought it, in my opinion.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I couldn't stop reading this book.  72 hours after I started I was done.  Great concept and well executed.  I never felt like I really had a bead on what would happen next.

B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book is so boring and at the same time it is good to have when you don't know a word and need to know what it means and I thin in this is why it is so boring so I would get the book
B009329ZF2|5.0|This is different SciFi Action Movie, Could Happen, Naw! Good Effects. A little lacking in Military Discipline to be believable.<br />Watched it twice so far.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|i NEVER THOUGHT THIS SERIES WOULD TAKE A TURN OFR THE BETTER OR AS YOU SAY IT GOT BETTER CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT CRANSTON WILL DO IN THE NEXT SERIES..
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Legend is one of the best compilations of Mr. Marley's music available. Inspiring, energetic, thoughtful...just listen and you'll understand the timelessness and relevance of his vision.
B00797MB0O|1.0|don't watch this movie. you will be severely disappointed.i waited the movie out to see if it would go somewhere, and there was no solution at all.
B002NWOOXW|5.0|It was a great movie and it arrived quickly and efficiently. The movie is funny and hilarious..and the process was simple
0307346617|5.0|I love this book.  It combines horror and realism like none other.  Brook's must have lived zombies for years to envision all the ramifications of a zombie apocalypse included in this novel; not only the personal effects but psychological, geo-political, military, religious.  I can, and have, read over and over again.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This story was free and I surprisingly liked it.  The story itself was far fetched, but all in all if you wanna kill a few hours and don't want to take a chance on paying for a story you may not like I would recommend it.  At least if you don't like cheesy Harlequin romances with an little risque sex...it was FREE!
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Wow just as the first and second season left off the third season picks up the pace and keeps you wanted to see the next<br />edition the following week.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|What can anyone say? It's Pink Floyd, how can you go wrong. Their music is the best of all the ages.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I purchased this app for my 6 year old son who loves angry birds and star wars. He just loves the game. It is a little tricky but he can handle it. lots of fun. would recomend
B00688628M|5.0|Great show. It tells the story of a tight-knit group of soldiers from the landing in Normandy through the taking of Hitler's &#34;Eagle Nest&#34;. The acting is fantastic as is the sense of realism.<br />Each show opens with snippets of interviews of the real-world veterans who inspired the characters in the series, but it is not until the end that you find out who each man is. They were truly remarkable individuals.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|It requires links that aren't automatically included.  The links must be searched out separately; some work.....and some don't.  The &#34;play&#34; potion doesn't integrate.
1899618740|2.0|I purchased this book for my 3rd-5th grade art classroom. Optical illusion books are always a hit with kids. Unfortunately I didn't realize this was a mini book and it won't even last a day on the book shelf without getting destroyed or lost. I guess this is my lesson to always read book dimensions. There are bigger, better, and more durable optical illusion books available.
B00005JNJV|5.0|I really enjoyed all the Batman series and now that Bale is him it is even better.  All the action parts are just great.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Makes it easy to search the web on my kindle.  I can easily see the webpage on the small screen.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I really enjoy angry birds games. This is a game that the whole family will enjoy with different levels and and  themes.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Just love the Jason Bourne series and this movie was packed with just as much action as the previous ones. It is definitely a keeper.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|OK, OK, so I'm a Grandma & Great-grandma and figured I should know what the kiddos are all playing! Too fun!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Every ten years a fantastic comedy show seems to rise above the rest.  In the 70s we had MASH, the 80s we had Night Court and Cheers, the 90s was Seinfeld and Drew Carey.  The dawn of the twenty-first century has the Big Bang Theory!  If you ever was a geek, this show is an absolute must.<br /><br />The only caveat is that it can be rude and ribald, not always something conservative people may find funny.
B00003CXI1|5.0|The series gets better each time a new movie is made of Harry and his adventures he gets in to.
B005723JSQ|5.0|This was my second book by Sophie Kinsella. It is one of those you can't put down. Not fun but hilarious. She makes every day struggles into comic strips. Light and entertaining. A sweet mothern day love story that will entertain from beginning to end.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I really enjoyed Winter of the World. I will be glad when the<br />third book comes out.  It is something to look forward to.<br />Yetive
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great book. Can't wait to read the next!  I know I will end up wishing there are more to the series.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|The acting is good in this one and the photography is outstanding.  The makeup is so good that Bella could be dying!!!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Quality of the package was as expected for a movie my wife and I both enjoyed.  The quality of the Blu-Ray was obviously top notch (not just a dvd pressed onto a br disc), and my wife has quite enjoyed the special features disc when she's decided to take a few minutes to view it here and there. I would give the movie a 8.5/10, but with the special features and all the package deserves a 5/5.
B001F12J0C|5.0|This is one series of movies that has you hooked after the first one was viewed and now you have to wait for the second and third movie but now with the trilogy you have all three movies.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|Fun, light reading that will give you some great laughs. An innocent and clumsy heroine that one can easily associate with. She goes through every day struggles with great sense of humor and perseverance. I enjoyed it so much that I'll be trying all other titles from the same author.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This product came unscratched, unopened, and brand new. For a low price and a great workout I'm glad I bought this.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|It is great to read this beautiful and unabridged translation.  Although long, Hugo makes it worth the trip giving details that could not possibly be covered in the theatrical or film version.  Found the backgrounds of the characters so compelling including the Cosette's mystery father and the life of the Bishop whose act of grace to Valjean was just one small encounter in a life well lived.
B004H51706|5.0|I gave my grandson a Bruder dump truck for Christmas last year....he came in this year and ask for another one, so I ordered the two SUV.  He was so excited with them.  Much fun!
B003L77GG0|4.0|was a great gift for a friend he really enjoys the smalleville series and hasn't been able to find it at the stores here
B000P0J06K|5.0|Just as great a movie as all the other ones.  This is the one where Keaton made his first movie and again a great performance.
B005KELQEU|5.0|It fits perfectly, is light weight and nicely padded for protection. The zipper works well too. Don't need all the bells and whistles on other cases and the price was just right. Go for it.
B001J9EHSC|4.0|Such an innocent face, yet she sings with such emotional depth. A good album to listen to with a glass of your favorite wine.

B0076DELIG|1.0|I'm a fan of the Harry Bosch series but this one sucks. It is written without taking you in the characters heads and with out background info on people like daughter appearing on the scene. If she was introduced in a previous book why not take a few sentences as other authors do to bring the reader up to date? This is an unfortunate mechanical work by an otherwise highly recommend excellent  author
B004GJDQT8|5.0|This is another source of great Android Apps...Amazon is great shopping experience, highly recommended to<br />any Android fan........Easy to shop
B005PK4ZHY|5.0|I miss the Desperate Housewives TV series, so purchased the Season 8.  I am enjoying every episode again.  I will make Season 1 my next purchase.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|We all forget at one point or another how blessed we are to be alive. We also forget to stop trying to simply see things from one perspective, or multiple perspective an just live in your perspective.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Great action and great extras— A Must for a collector! He's been a life-long fan and getting this made him smile big!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is one of the best games I've ever played. I'd really recommend this game to anyone any age. I have a lot of apps on my kindle fire (Mostly one direction) but this one is at the top of my most used list. 500000000 Stars!
B008B68J2G|5.0|Okay I really love this set. It comes with a lot of pieces and is very detailed. Everywhere you look there is molded webs,spiders, and skulls hidden all over the place. And like I said the detail is amazing. There is an adorable little bat that sits on the top of the cart, and I didn't realize until I opened it there are skulls that hang from the umbrella. My favorite though has to be the little cupcake shaped like a brown bat and the yellow cake with a spider on top. So cute!! Also the artwork on the box showed both Lagoona and Cleo!! I was so excited to see this. I am hoping that maybe they will release both of these as Scaris dolls in the future. They had new hairstyles and outfits (Lagoona is shown with the most adorable octopus hairclip). Man I really hope Mattel manufactures these!! The text on the box also hints at a possible Scaris DVD release as it talks about the ghouls adventures there. Guess we will have to wait and see if that comes to fruition. Anyways, this is an awesome set and I think I will combine it with my coffin bean furniture to make one huge monster high diorama. If you want this don't hesitate to get it...it rocks!!
B009MO5960|5.0|Can have the collection and not have this one... i' am a fanatic with resident evil and when my daughter gave me this movie as a gift I was speechless after I finished the movie it was GREAT!!!!
B000TCEU4Q|5.0|This throttle quadrant is a great purchase, especially if you are adding on to the saitek pro-flight yolk system. This quadrant is usb, and comes with extra heads (a red, a blue, three blacks, and one quad engine bar, which is one head that attaches to four stalks). Overall, a great addition to any flight-sim setup.
B002QFYJF4|1.0|So the movie started with quite a promising introduction - it's gonna be good, I said to myself. One hour into it I was thinking it is a bit slow, but there will be a great twist at the end to tie it all up, right? Two hours into it I had the sinking feeling that there is no interesting twist coming up - they should have done or by now. In hour three, supernatural things (that's right) started happening for no reason. Then it ended - no twist, no sense, nothing to leave the viewer with &#34;wow, I am glad I watched it&#34;. I don't remember when was the last time I hated a movie so much.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I downloaded the app to my kindle fire and I was super excited. But shortly after whenever I try to play a game my screen goes blank and then closes the app :(
B008MBXFEM|4.0|I have the first two movie soundtracks from Hans Zimmer and this is a nice continuation and ending to the series.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Flynn's use of descriptive language is brilliant.  The story is suspenseful and well-crafted.  However, every character was thoroughly unlikable, leaving me with no one to \\"root\\" for, so to speak.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|My daughter loves this movie she is extremely happy..<br />I would recommended to anyone that likes the movie the action is also great as well... BUY IT ALREADY!!!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love the Facebook app because I like to keep up with friends and family. I also like keeping up with news stories
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely could not stop reading this book! I could feel the emotions portrayed all throughout the text. Anguish, happiness, even fear. What an amazing read!!
B009Y6UCRC|5.0|Caught her performance on the Kennedy Center Honors show and immediately bought this album.  I am very glad I did.
B005X5XIL0|5.0|PURCHASED FOR MY HUSBAND.  IF YOU LIKE ANDREA BOCELLI - THIS IS A MUST HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION.  EVERY SONG IS BEAUTIFUL.
B009VB998I|5.0|I rented this video yesterday for my 7 year old granddaughter and she absolutely loves watching it.  I saw a little of the video and it is cute.  I rented the HD version because her Kindle is HD and the picture is fantastic.  Would recommend it to everyone.
0307352145|5.0|Kept my interest and was the first I read of work/research about those of us who are energized by reflection over social contacts and can adjust just fine.  Very interesting and quick read.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|I have three boys in the house and we have our fair share of Nerf dart guns.  This one is, by far, the coolest of the bunch.  This accelerator system it has launches these darts fast and far.  If you're standing close enough, these may actually sting a bit.  Eye protection is now mandatory!
B0001GL3K4|5.0|Unforgettable! It is a movie for everybody. All life stories touching your hard. Great music and actors. May be I couldn't find the right words to express what I think. It is our family Christmas movie.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Products were just what I  wanted, ordered, needed.  I had looked everywhere (local stores)  without success on the ballpoint refills. Thanks for timely and accurate fulfillment of order.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Not bad of an app for the Kindle fire. When expanding your city there some flawes near water borders, which are block from placing any building near by.  Overall nice game app to past the time and no stress while playing.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Call of Atlantis is very addicting. It is a great game to unwind with. It has a simple concept but you still have to use strategy. I like to relax after a stressful day with a couple levels.
1452110581|5.0|I gave this adorable little book to all my cat-loving friends for Christmas (plus a copy for me!) and we all love it! Very witty and SPOT-ON about cats' behavior. I laughed 'til I cried.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game totally passes the time. I enjoyed it, it had some challenging levels. And it was free, so that was good too.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|after losing the charging cord that came with my kindle, I was very excited to find that I could buy just the cord on amazon.  it works like a charm.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|I got this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! Typical high quality work by Pixar. If you like other Pixar movies you will probably like this too.
030726999X|5.0|I already read two of the three books in the trilogy and needed this one to complete set.  These were great books.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Bought the movie because I liked it in the theater.  I had not seen it in 3D.  The 3D special effects are great. Good Movie.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Awesome, great, spectacular movie. And all the actors were GREAT. And I mean all of them!!!!<br /><br />Clint Eastwood has not lost his touch. Who knew getting old would be great.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|This is a great movie--one from which all of us can learn many of life's lessons. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are great.
B008RYN44U|5.0|I'm a long time fan since the first album. If you like No Doubt you're going to love this :)  If you only liked one album give it a few plays before rushing to review! This album rocks!  People who review this negatively don't know what progressive music is.  If they seriously want all their art to be a photo copy of every scene they've ever seen in the past, then I can't help that, too bad they have to slam one of the few great REAL rock bands left tho.<br /><br />To the &#34;this isn't No Doubt&#34; person, LOL gimmie a break, you should pay more attention to them.  Take a course in music appreciation...  clean the wax plugs out of your ears, something!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I thought this book was inspiring. I loved it. I definitely recommend it to anyone having a difficult time. Just great.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This is another great adventure for John Corey.  It grabs you from page 1 and it's hard to put it down.  Highly recommend this book!
B0055EAJ7A|4.0|Having purchased a 3D TV and Player I was looking for films with great effects.  This one fits the bill.
B009GESJH2|2.0|not all that.Not one of Kid Rock greatest cds.I couldn't get into it at all.Wouldn't suggest to anyone.<br />Just not good at all.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This is a great story. Gives you a lot to think about.  It is going to be made into a movie, too!
B0079R8IYW|5.0|Excellent protection for my Kindle Fire.  I like the quality.  It's just enough to protect and keep it clean when not in use.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Strange to be able to use your pc from your kindle , so printing is a breeze.<br />The only issue I've found is scrolling down page, but that might be just me.
B0071MV540|4.0|It's a good comedy movie. Don't expect an epic cinematic experience, but some hilarious scenes mixed with a landscape that is familiar to anyone who has even a basic knowledge of Midtown Manhattan makes for a good watch.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Daughter really likes them! Any little princess would be pleased. Stickers did come off a little in the beginning but after giving them a firm patting they manage to stick.
B00AE2LJVS|3.0|a little slow to develop and and just an OK movie. Some parts were hard to understand at times also
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Great story line. The suspense has kept me watching the series year to year. I strongly recommend watching this DVD.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Great app! Excited to have it on my kindle fire! Now its every where!! Its on my cell, fire &amp; computer!!!
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Bought this movie off of Amazon Instant Video because my son had to watch it and write a paper on it for one of his college courses. We were pleasantly surprised with how good it was. It was a thoroughly enjoyable movie at an excellent price.
B0076R62FM|5.0|This movie is absolutely hilarious, and a great comdy/ parody of the James Bond series. A lot of the stuff in it requires a good knowledge of the bond series.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Grabbed my attention from page 1, couldn't put it down. The concept of being controlled by emotions is horrifying,Suzanne Collins does a terrific job of bringing it to life
B006LSZECO|4.0|I lost a lot of sleep because I couldn't put this book down!  I was pretty sure I knew what was happening with the story before it was revealed, but that didn't diminish my enjoyment of the story at all. In fact, I'm always pretty proud of myself when I can pick up on the clues in a story and figure it out before it's laid out for me.<br /><br />This is a disturbing story, and I both loved and hated the ending.  I loved it because it didn't tie everything up with a neat little happy bow. I hated it because being the optimist that I am, I still wish bad experiences in our lives could be resolved and tied up with that happy little bow after all.  This story had a believable ending that was consistent with the characters.  Real people are too complex for that bow, and it would've seemed silly for this book to have a predictable storybook ending.<br /><br />I'm not generally a huge fan of \\"thrillers,\\" but I'll read this author again.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Great story line. The suspense has kept me watching the series year to year. I strongly recommend watching this DVD.
B007VGXS8M|5.0|am a true childhood waLdo fan and this app is pretty good..has several different levels and new objects to find along with mini games
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great book...surprising, touching ending.<br />A fast pleasurable read. Another Nicholas Sparks classic.<br />Can't wait for the movie....hope it's as good as the book.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book, but it sure is long. It was eye-opening as to Jobs' life, and explained a lot about how he led at Apple. However, if it weren't for a really long car trip, I doubt I would ever have finished this thing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so addictive I play this game 24/7. At night when I go to bed I think of other ways to finish a levels.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|This was a VERY suspenseful story that had me creeped out and terrified from beginning to end.  The author did a good job of showing how debilitating OCD can be for a person, although I think the character's recovery was pretty fast and not entirely believable.  If you liked the movie Sleeping With the Enemy, you'll love this book.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|The first Blu-Ray we watched in 3D on our new HDTV.  Amazing!  My son promises me that he will go into all the special features to tell me the &#34;answers&#34; to the &#34;questions.&#34;
B0086700CM|5.0|Both my 5 & 7 yr olds love this game.  Keeps them busy for hours! Have not played it myself, but they have not come to me with any problems.
159514188X|5.0|I've been hearing a lot of good reviews about this book that I cannot control anymore my craving to read it. So yeah, I bought a copy and devoured it. The synopsis itself is a good reason to read this book. It's creepy and quite disturbing yet you wanted to know more about it.<br /><br />Hannah Baker committed suicide. But before her death she recorded thirteen messages for thirteen people that affected her life, thirteen people who had lead her to the end. It is recorded in the tapes  the reasons why she ended her life. Each person who are included in the list will receive the tapes and will hear the recording. And Clay Jensen is one of them. The Clay Jensen who never did anything wrong. The Clay Jensen who is the goody good type of guy. The Clay Jensen who now wonders why he is included in the list.<br /><br />Several minutes of reading it was enough to say that I'm drawn to the story. Although at first I was a little confused and lost of the happenings, the creepiness and mystery kept me from reading it. I wanted to know badly why Hannah committed suicide. I wanted to know Clay's role and what he has done. And because of my craving mind wanting to get answers I finished the book in one sitting.<br /><br />The storyline is unique and stunning. This is the first time I have read a book written that way. Hearing Hannah's story and at the same time knowing Clay's perspective was incredible! And with that kind of writing the reader can feel the grief, sadness, hurt and curiousity the main protagonist has felt. Even I felt Hannah's pain. It seems like I was with Clay, beside him, listening to Hannah's sweet yet sad voice. The story felt so alive and I was a part of it.<br /><br />A part of me understands Hannah, not to the extent that I have experience the things that happened to her. I understand her in a way that I know how she felt, being tired of everything that you just wanted to give up. But still I am always against the act of suicide. There's an inspiring quoteI read a couple of weeks ago that goes \\"Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem\\" and from that quote I learned. So for those of you guys, who plans to do the same thing Hannah did, I would like to tell you to look around, ponder on the positive things that happened and don't be selfish. You're leaving other people behind who loves and cares for you. For once think about them too. But I surely doubt there is anyone of you here wanting to end his/her life, right? Come on guys! There are still a lot of books to read this upcoming year and you don't want to miss it :P<br /><br />What can I say? Thirteen Reasons Why is an outstanding novel that will make a person ponder on things he/she has done that affected other people. It makes you think sharper and better. This book has took my heart and brimmed my mind with thoughts that can help someone out there. I am in love with this book though it was heartbreaking I will still give the love it deserves.<br /><br />Random thought(s): I want to hear Hannah's voice in real life! But that just give me the creeps..yet  I want to hear it. It will be interesting :)
B0057LUI0O|5.0|This movie has a great vibe to it. My kids love to dance to the music and I love to see them smiling and laughing. Great movie!
B008WCP2PG|5.0|You would have to have been living on another planet not to see and hear all the hype for this movie this past summer!  It is just as HOT and entertaining as you probably heard.  The view of Channing's bare backside is worth the price of admission!!  Tatum and Alex Pettyfer in the main roles are great and you should definitely have your own copy even if you saw the movie in theatres.  Take it from me--Buy a copy!!
B00914JWSW|1.0|Pitiful recording by La Divina. She sings in that Hypercontrolled whisper with little vibrato. The choices of songs are awful. As Seth Rudetsky says...&#34;Barbara, pre-perm good, post-perm bad&#34;
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|It's as good as the movie, the only downfall is that it cuts out parts of the movie. For instance in At the End of the Day, Fantine does not get to try to defend or explain herself to the foreman. In Look Down it cuts almost immediately to Javert's part.<br /><br />Still, for 5 dollars, it is definitely worth the money to tide me over until the DVD comes out!
B008XG1X18|1.0|I tried this app and it as well just requires alot of information from all your social sites, but does not validate security and I am a private person. If I cannot control where my information goes or who views it, I won't participate in the app. I have uninstalled this app. Seems like anyone and their brother can see your information and I am not about sharing with strangers. I have uninstalled this app.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game its what I was expecting and is a lot of fun. its very addictive and I find myself wanting to play it right when I get on my kindle.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I thought the book was marvelous.<br />As River Song would say, \\"SPOILERS!!\\"<br /><br /> Of course I despised Mary at the beginning, but I also pitied her. I cried at the end.
B0000714BP|5.0|A wonderful story of understanding and love between friends--who happen to be drag queens.  The late Patrick Swayze gives a stellar perfomance as Vida Boheme---one of his best characters ever!!! Wesley Snipes as Noxema Jackson and John Leguizamo as Chi Chi Rodriguez round out the threesome with wonderful portrayals as well.  This movie is for EVERYONE---not just the gay community  If you miss this modern day CLASSIC, you have missed a chance to see something really special.  You will laugh--you will cry--but you will never be bored!!!!!!  ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005LAIH2W|3.0|I was one of the few who liked this in a theater. Taylor Kitch (The name!!) is a good action star and has a crazy hot body. The design of the movie is posh fun. I have to say I found it a lot more difficult to stay with on TV than in the theater.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|What can I say?  Love the Jesse Stone movies and bought a bunch-in series-so I could watch them over and over again.  Good Plots, good actors and who doesn't love Tom Selleck?  Good Price too
B009MCRHH6|4.0|It's a great game that has unique game mechanics that's fun for adults and kids. Puzzles are tough are fun to solve. I recommend.
B008BHAV9Y|5.0|Excellent guitar playing by superb guitarists. I Could listen to it all day long. I hope they produce another one soon.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This was such a great deal on these DVDs. We had a blast watching them together as a family. I loved how they were all in one case. It makes them easier to keep track of.
B007SPPANM|5.0|Everyone knows the name of the most famous ship of all time, The Titanic.  This movie interpretation is SUPERB!!!!!  Even though the story is heartwrenching and the disaster is sheer human loss, the devotion to detail in this picture makes you feel as though you were there.  If you have seen it a dozen times--or never seen it--buy it.  No home video library should be without a copy.
B002N5N5R0|5.0|got it mt grandson is in SOA heaven.  He has not left his room since it came. thank you for this order
B000OVLBFS|5.0|What can I say?  Love the Jesse Stone movies and bought a bunch-in series-so I could watch them over and over again.  Good Plots, good actors and who doesn't love Tom Selleck?  Good Price too
B004I1K2NW|4.0|I picked up this movie because its a funny, scary, eminently enjoyable romp. Michael J Fox  is one of my favorite physical comics ever, and John Astin is always good for a laugh. This movie combines a fascinating mixture of laughs, and genuinely creepy moments. Fox is a Ghostbuster con artist, who can see ghosts, and uses a couple in his scams. An insane serial killer, an insane federal agent, an insane DEAD serial killer, an insane mash-up of a plot. You get the idea. Of course everything comes pristinely to life in blu-ray. If you've already seen The Frighteners, you know, and if you haven't, I can highly recommend this on the movie alone. However, as big a draw for me, is watching Peter Jackson getting his start in computer effects. Jackson was a small time New Zealand director when tapped to helm this picture. As he put it, his first time to work with a &#34;star&#34;, and with what at the time he thought was a BIG Budget. It was in post production, and wondering what to do with all the computers he'd bought, that the Lord of the Rings ideas began to come together. So in short, this is a movie worthy of a place in your personal collection. Now as always, lets pop some corn, grab our favorite brew, crank the home theater to neighbors putting up for sale sign levels, and lets enjoy some MOVIES.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|Expected a bit more from Pixar, this movie was alright to kill an evening, nothing to it. It's boring and predictable.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing it blew me away and I love it I recommend this book to everyone it will take your breath away
B0072OFM28|5.0|The series from the STARZ network is not to be missed. This is actually the third season of the series but is listed as the second because Andy Whitfield (Spartacus) passed away from cancer after the first season and the second part of the series dealt with a different character, Gannicus, played by Dustin Clare titled Spartacus-Gods of the Arena.  Liam McIntyre takes over the role of Spartacus and does a wonderful job of trying to fill the shoes of Andy Whitfield.  Both men took the part and made it their own in different but unique ways.  The fourth and final season is due out in 2013 and I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005I0DLXK|5.0|I was a big fan of &#34;Loud&#34; when it came out on CD (the clean version).  After debating whether to also get the unedited version, Amazon's pricing made the decision easy.  Rihanna continues to show she is an adult with this album (as she did with Rated R).  S&M is catchy and shows her rock side.  While it didn't get any radio play because of the content it still is a great opener.  The songs that got the most fanfare, What's My Name, Cheers, Love the Way You Lie are great, but I really like Man Down and California King Bed.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Loved Loved Loved it! Have watched it 4 times and have lent it out several times.  It is a great movie that is pretty much historically correct and the actors were wonderful.  Can't say enough about it.
B0011Z7ILM|5.0|Great LP. One of my favorites and was so happy to buy it. It is awesome condition and I listen to it all the time.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I don't even no if I am playing with some one or not why do you need to send your picture to them u don't even get back a picture . if I were u I would not get it I give this dumb game a 0 it is a wast of time to even download it
B00785P2QC|3.0|If you liked the original Virtual City you will love this one. More of the same. Keep up the good work.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Andy Whitfield portrays Spartacus in the first season of STARZ's now famous miniseries.  Andy passed away from cancer before he could reprise his role for the second season and it was a blow to the fans and the storyline as well.  If you know nothing about this series but are interested in Ancient Rome and an accurate portrayal of that time, you must see the entire collection.  The first three seasons are available on dvd now and even though I did not miss an episode when originally aired, I still puchased the discs because the series is incredible!!!  The fourth season is due out sometime in early 2013 and this will be the final chapter to an absolutely enthralling story.  Be forewarned though; it is quite graphic in its depiction of violence and sex.  It is NOT for the squeamish nor the prudish.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|I think everyone knows this is a great movie. I had a little trouble with the download, but I called Amazon and they helped.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|I hate to admit I didn't get it...got to the end and was not too sure what I had read. Will try the movie for 3D effects.
B000000993|5.0|Great LP. One of my favorites and was so happy to buy it. It is awesome condition and I listen to it all the time.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Love Clint Eastwood movies. You will like it even if you are not a baseball fan. Humor and a good message.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Loved this book! Can't wait to watch the movie. I couldn't put my kindle down read this book in three days
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|How can You describe a Movie like this ? It is TWO Movies, really. One Part that shows how Alvin York became what He was...a Real Man. He had a HARD Life...but a Great upbringing. He knew the difference between Right and Wrong. And One Part that shows what He did to earn All the Medals bestowed upon Him. I know some of the Movie is ''Fictionalized'' but the Majority is True. York Himself wanted Gary Cooper to play Him and Coop didn't let Anyone down. It's almost a Mystical Portrayal at times. When You add in the Supporting Cast that included Walter Brennan, Margaret Wycherly, George Tobias and too many other Great Ones to name...The Movie instantly becomes ''Classic.'' Being in Black and White just adds to the ''Genuine Feel'' of the Times. If You don't like this kind of Movie just move on to the next Film...but if You DO like them...THIS Movie needs to be One You see...AND add to Your Collection. You WILL NOT regret it.
B0096DZKZC|5.0|I love part 2 it's definitely an improvement over the first one. :)  this game works great on my kindle.<br />Keep up the good work I look forward to  playing more games from your company
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This story kept me really involved and a few times a bit confused but what a great story.  I read it constantly as it never ceased to keep me interested. Well worth reading and written extremely well.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|Great LP. One of my favorites and was so happy to buy it. It is awesome condition and I listen to it all the time.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|Not your usual Mark Wahlberg movie. Funny with adult humor and language not a kids movie. Ted is so cute.
B00846REIS|3.0|Too much like Fifty Shades.  Very good sex scenes that kept me hot but Eva is very immature. Her ways were on my nerves!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|After seeing the stage version of les miserables earlier this year, for the first time, I was really excited to see this movie and actually waited to purchase the album until I could get the movie soundtrack. This album does not disappoint! Every cast member did an amazing job, and after seeing the movie, while listening to this album it's like being in the theater again! Highly recommended!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Wow!  Love this series.  The episodes just get better and better.  Only watched the first three episodes so far and can't wait to watch the rest.
B0098460O4|4.0|They sing great together have good career ahead and<br />I will be watching them develop and shine good cd best of luck
B005SNLMP6|5.0|I bought this book thinking it was the hardcover (because it somehow got listed under that category), but couldn't return it because it was a Christmas gift for someone & I wouldn't have had enough time to get another.<br /><br />It was in great condition, though, and when the sellers found out that I had bought the wrong one, they apologized and refunded the item. It was the first time something like this had happened. I was very surprised and pleased. They have a lot of integrity.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was by far the best book I heave ever read.  I was sucked in from the first page and never put it down. Dean was amazing. I felt his every word.the way he expressed him self.  You can only wish there were men like Dean.  Sky was great she seem to keep it together as much as she went through u would think the author would have made her out to be such a mess.  But that was not the case. I will recommend this book to everyone.  Thank u for writing this book.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book was really good and I never expected the ending to turn out the way it did.<br /> I can't wait till the movie comes out.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I can't recommend this book enough. This is by far one of the best set of books I have read in years!
B00499NHLC|3.0|The acting and story line are okay, however, the sound track was so poor that we could not enjoy the second episode.
0143123173|4.0|Very good start to the series - glad I am reading Johnson's work after watching Season One on TV.  Great characters and vivid imagery, not to mention a sharp plot with several twists throughout.  Did not see the ending coming at all on this one which makes it even better.  Only thing that kept it from a full five stars was I found the writing a little choppy in some parts - but it is also the first novel in the series.  No doubt it will become more crisp with each passing installment.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|Great Movie... Disney always goes the extra mile for children entertainment. Very nice family story. I would recommend this movie.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The 5ft micro USB cable is a great buy.  It gives more reach so that the cord does not short out. If I get
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's a very good book. it kept me hooked from the very beginning. I recommend you should read this book.
B00A80SHFM|1.0|The sound track is very poorly recorded; female solos so soft that their words can't be understood and then the next piece is so loud you must turn down the sound, and them back to too low on the next piece.  We had to make very major changes to the volume 6-8 times on the album, tried this on several players, same drastic extreme sound results.  A waste of money to purchase this edition, we have the older studio soundtrack and it's excellent quality.  Save your money.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We very much enjoyed watching season one and liked season two even more.  I would highly recommed Downton Abbey to all of my friends.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This..game is fun and challenging. It's great for just relaxing. It can be addicting though so be prepared to set some limits.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. It got a bit confusing at times but over all I got the big picture. Little inappropriate at times.
030758836X|5.0|I just finished \\"Gone Girl\\".  It's a must read!  Amy is beautiful -  perfect blond hair, incredible blue eyes, great student and successful writer.  She's so perfect her parents wrote a very successful series of Amazing Amy books chronicling her life from preschool through marriage.  Everyone loves Amy.  Then she meets Nick - handsome, successful, amazing Nick.  Their marriage can't be anything but amazing.  But sometimes when you scratch the surface on perfect you find it's anything but...  It's a big book, but it's an amazing ride that kept me up late several nights.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie first and the book was way better and interesting. I can't wait to read the rest of the series!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was fantastic. I cried and laughed. My heart ached with Charlie during the tough times and soared during the good. I finished this book and just cried.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was very moving and informative. Eben Alexander III 's descriptions were very moving.I enjoyed it very much, thank you!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Its just a weird dictionary ...... really its boring alot of pages sooooo boring  dont read this book its not even a real dictionary
0545259096|4.0|This is the last in a series of three.  They are good books and easy reads. The book came in good condition.
178054068X|4.0|This was a gift for my 10 year old niece. She was thrilled with the POSTER sized calendar and pictures.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Finished in two days! Never lost interest. Highly recommended to everyone. I'm 16 and enjoyed this more than any other book.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|The movie was great, great action. But unlike other movies we had watched on Amazon the Clarity was awful very grainy like it was an OLD movie from the 1970's
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|While I love this movie for the story, the cinematography is exceptional and viewing in blu ray quality is a must.  The actors are marvelous and the chemistry of the cast is fabulous.  Best version of this classic I have seen.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Great read, couldn't put it down. Got my husband to read it  too, he only likes war or books that are scary.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|so retarded its addicting. wife's fault I play it now. I don't think I can stop playing it. hats you have to pay for gems
B0094M0P4G|5.0|I chose 5 stars because it was a great movie. Loved Christinas singing in the movie and Cher was great also. Loved Stanley Tucci. Had a great story line. One of my favorite movies. Had everything.
B00ARAO0WM|3.0|Interesting and entertaining action of the chase of the messenger bike through heavy traffic in New York City.  However, not much dialog.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I like Gillian Flynn's style of writing, jumping from present to past and using different characters' points of view.  I downloaded Dark Places and Sharp Objects after reading Gone Girl and am very pleased with her work.  Highly recommend.
B000MV90IU|5.0|This classic movie is a must for any DVD library.  The fact that it's in blu ray format is even better.  The quality is so much better than the old DVD copy I had.
B007FJFDXS|3.0|while this app was a nice change I did not like it when the cube would barely roll then the same touch would send it flying
B002U0KHMY|5.0|If you enjoy mysteries, you'll like White Collar. I love this show!! It's smart, funny, and well written. The actors and characters blend well together.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Not your classic &#34;Hollywood&#34; love story, but real-life-issues-story told with humor and tears. Great acting and story here. Well done!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|As a nurse and a firm believer in the afterlife, I was excited to read this book regarding the author's NDE.  Having read other books regarding NDE, and from my experience as a former ICU nurse where patients have described similar events, I looked forward to reading about this author's experience and how it has affected his life and practice since then.<br />While I can understand the limitations of the author's experience, I believe that the author didn't really go into depth regarding his  personalization or internalization of his NDE.  Perhaps the author is still formulating his response to this awesome event.  And, perhaps, I need to re-read the book with that understanding.  While the book was interesting and worth reading, I felt something was missing.
B009RH9FR6|2.0|I bought this because I love the marware cover I have for the original Kindle Fire and specifically because I wanted a model that had a handstrap (so far, this is the only one I could find).  The quality is good, and the rotating stand up feature is fine, BUT because they changed this to a tri-fold to support the rotating feature, the piece with the Kindle in it now flaps around if you attempt to use the hand strap.  My Kindle already fell out once - thank goodness it was onto my lap, not the floor.<br /><br />They should've created a version without the rotating feature for those that are more interesting in using the hand strap.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Had to get this classic in blu ray.  It is a must watch every year during the holidays.  The quality is much better than standard DVD.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|Really like this game.  Love the colors and the graphics.  It reminds me almost of the old pong game except you play by yourself.
B0002KZAKS|4.0|We needed a durable and reliable vocal mic for our home studio, and this mic has exceeded or expectations.<br />It is a nice SM58 clone, and that's a good thing--vocal clarity is very similar to the 58, it is built like a tank, sounds great, and fits the bill nicely.  Came with a stand clip and a plastic case, and would make a nice addition to your PA or home studio.<br /><br />The good:  Excellent build quality, hefty, nice sound, super price--has held up very well over the last year.<br />The bad: None, yet.  The kids love it.<br /><br />Summary:  If you're looking to outfit your band or studio on a budget, snag this mic.
B000816TCY|5.0|How can you rate a battery any less than five stars when it works and it is taking great pictures !
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I hadn't read any of the Jack Reacher novels, and I just finished Baldacci's \\"Zero Day\\", where he introduces his new character, John Puller.  All the reviews of Baldacci's new character said that he wasn't as good as Jack Reacher, and I have to agree with that, in spades!  Reacher is a giant of a man, intellectually and physically (Tom Cruise; are you kidding me?), formerly a military investigator, with all of the guts and special \\"abilities\\" found in your normal special-ops heroes.<br /><br />Just a year out of the Army, he's just drifting from place to place, enjoying his new-found freedom.  But he drifts into the wrong place at the wrong time, and is immediately, and personally, embroiled in a murder/counterfeiting plot that threatens to bring down the American economy.<br /><br />It's a great story, with some very interesting characters, a couple of belief-stretching coincidences, but altogether a great read!! Since there are so many more Reachers to read, I can only assume it just keeps on getting better and better!<br /><br />By the way, I think Jack Reacher is also superior to Nathan McBride, Andrew Peterson's new character introduced in \\"First to Kill\\".
B009D0LBRO|5.0|They just updated this app to work with the nabi 2 and it is a great game.<br />The only issue, is that you must hold the nabi 2 upside down (the camera on bottom) for the menu system to work (I have no idea why, but it works).<br />I have been a fan of the rayman franchise for a while and this episode did not dissapoint.<br />They have managed to have a fast paced game work with only having to tap the screen.  I wish there were more like it.<br /><br />Earthworm Jim next perhaps?
B002LFAHBO|5.0|This is a great movie any time but we especially love it at Christmas.  Since it is a yearly must, we had to have it in blu ray.  Can't beat the quality of the picture.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|We watch this every year around Christmas time with the kids. It is the best movie ever. What a great message.
B00AEFVRB2|5.0|must see. campy white trash thriller that grinds away at your moral fiber one drumstick at a time. cult classic from day one. all these trashy reviews don't do it justice. we saw it in the theater and the group I went with talked about how messed up this film was for twenty minutes outside the theater
159420411X|5.0|Another Christmas gift for my brother.  My brother has a background in mathematics and was interested in how Nate Silver makes such accurate predictions based on data samples.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|As a preface, I should state that I am not a zombie fanatic. Nor, for that matter, a lover of the vampire, witches, or other occult genres. I am a lover of good fiction and creativity in many different forms.<br /><br />I was hoping to find in this book a work of literature that just so happened to fall into the zombie genre. Sadly, it falls horribly flat as a novel. In fact it is not a novel at all, as Brooks alludes to in his sub-title. I do give Brooks credit for creativity. He takes a subject which he is obviously infatuated with and examines the practical implications of what an all-out zombie infestation of the human race would mean from a practical standpoint. He presents his imaginations as vignettes recorded from interviews of survivors of the zombie apocalypse. Unfortunately, it comes across as a really well imagined and lengthy creative writing project rather than anything resembling a novel. The collection is merely case after case of short stories chronicling peoples' experiences. There is no central plot. There is no character development. Quite frankly there are no characters, but merely an endless stream of 2 dimensional caricatures depicting numerous stereotypical figures we have run into any number of times ... only they lived through a zombie apocalypse. As such, I found no emotional connection to the book. No suspense. No drama. The good news is that if you aren't particularly interested in one account, the scene will completely shift in 4 or 5 pages. If you do find a connection to a specific \\"character\\" (which was rare for me) ... well, the scene will still shift in 4 or 5 pages.<br /><br />Brooks gets credit for creativity. It is an interesting, if flawed, concept for a book. And it is a quick, easy read (otherwise I likely would not have finished the book). Hard-core zombie lovers are sure to be drawn to the book. If you are looking for a good piece of fiction, look elsewhere.
098555780X|5.0|Has lots of references nicely shown for making yourself. Organized well into chapters with related type of projects. Great for learning and starting out.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|If you like books filled with magic, mystery, and a little romance this is an excellent choice. This book will keep you on your toes as the plot comes together like the pieces of a puzzle. The imagery is incredible as well.
0812981448|5.0|This is a great read. Interesting and inspiring. I read it and then bought several copies for graduation gifts and gifts for young adults in our lives to inspire them to do something to make the world a better place.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|I grew up in the days of pinball; so this game brings back a lot of memories. The  sights and sounds of this game are second to none. The physics of the game are right on. One of the best 99 cents I have spent on a game.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|I got this complete Series package (32 DVDs) from Amazon for only $25!!! Are you kidding....this is great for a rainy day....throw in a Married With Children DVD and start laughing.  Fav episode is the sky diving Santa Christmas episode....great for Holiday Cheer.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|After having seen a variety of film version of this story, I am very glad to have found it on Kindle to read for myself.  So glad that I did.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is such a creative story.
B001R10BEG|5.0|No different than most of the Blu-Rays and DVD's I order, they arrive fact and are in new condition, perfect!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have played a lot of these but this is the best. great job.... cant wait to see your other games.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|One of his best but I love everything he does.  Glad he finally did a Christmas cd.  Listening to it now.
B009329ZF2|5.0|If you like good kick butt action movies with really good special effects this one is for you, the idea of the aliens was handle fairly well.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Great star wars affects. Glad I was able to get the game free!! My sister an I are constantly trying to beat eachothers score :) well worth getting!
B006O6FK2W|4.0|After seeing the Dark Knight Rises, my boys both really loved the Bat.  This seems to be the only toy they really made for this and it is ok.  What we do like is that it has a handle which makes it great for flying around.  The missles are in good spots and the one side makes gun noises.  The only big complaint is the cockpit door is kinda flimsy and can fall off if your taking too much fire from bad guys or if you are flying around too fast.  This has room for one 4\\" Batman figure and his cape sometimes is tough to keep in the cockpit.  It also was able to fit a Marvel 4\\" Captain America figure when Batman wasn't looking!  The Batman that shoots out the top is like a nerf version of Batman.  We don't really like that and could do without it.  Overall we like the toy, but wish they had one for the 6\\" figures.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|For someone who has never been big on reading, this book did the trick. Highly recommended it. Thank you Suzanne Collins.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read! Very nice paced and good description throughout their book and good turn of events.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|We watch this every Christmas and had missed it this year and since I did not have a copy of the movie I was delighted to get my own copy!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is my 4th time reading this trilogy and it pulls at my heart every single time. I can't get enough of 50 Shades!
B00594XOZU|5.0|I was sceptical about getting this app. especially with it being free. Thought there might be strings attached. But I've been able to keep in touch with friends a lot better than I would be with my old phone. I cant afford an Iphone. So this app is great to have so I'm not left out of the loop :)
B0084I9QIW|5.0|I bought this to watch with my two sons who love the songs Beat It and Thriller.  Growing up in the 80's, I never saw Michael Jackson in concert, but this at least gave me an idea about what his concerts might be like.  Great performance and alot of his best songs.  Feature-wise, this DVD has very little, but the main content is what you want anyways.  I would recommend to any MJ fan!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This is a quick read book, which serves as a delightful reminder of the true value of spreading joy and good cheer!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was completely hooked on this book and could not put it down. Very well written and very romantic. Definitely one of my new favorites.
B007SGM084|5.0|What can you say about this book that hasn't been said. I first heard about these books watching some morning TV show. What interested me the most was during a late night TV show where the Doctor who highly critisized these book was having a discussion with his wife, who loved these book, on why he considered them porn. I bought the books. I downloaded them on March 31, they were my birthday present to me, and I will tell you this. IT WAS THE BEST GIFT I GAVE MYSELF. It took me 5 days to read all three and that was only because I had to work and take care of my family. It killed me when I had to put down my Kindle. It's almost the New Year and I have read the set several times. My stomach still fills with butterflies. They are hot, steamy, errotic. I know that the movies will never be as hot as the books but oh do I really hope so..
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Such a wonderful book. I was so happy that the book didn't take the traditional path. Loved the twists and turns
B004HD61KE|5.0|I just finished reading this book.  It was very well written and captivating.  James Rollins is a brilliant author with a flair for the dramatic.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|The product came on time and works great. Thanks for being so awesome! We love buying our movies from you!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I thought this book was a great one!! I loved it!!!!!<br />I said this because it showed all the important details and it was very funny! I would rate this book 5 stars!!!!  :)
B0091LS07E|5.0|I like how she gets back to the R&B she began with. Not that i don't like her other albums, i love them all. She makes real R&B music, but many people aren't going to like it because of its subdued nature. They should because this is what real R&B music sounds like.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|No complaints! This book was amazing, captivating and definitely spoke to me. I really recommend this book for anyone, all ages!
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|This movie was cute and funny most of the time. I didn't like the predictability in the plot development and slow movement of most of the movie.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Great program and was a great gift to give.  The price was great. Hope to see more deals like this.
B003UYV08E|5.0|The product came on time and works great. Thanks for being so awesome! We love buying our movies from you!
B00846REIS|2.0|Although the plot line of this novel shows promise the dialogue is unrealistic and lacks any character.  With better dialogue I feel like this novel would be more on par with the 50 Shades of Grey novels it is compared to.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|As good as I expected. Breaking Bad is just about the best thing that's EVER been made for Television!! It gets better all the time!
B004A8ZX28|4.0|The movie Unknown was enjoyed by the entire family.<br />Usually I can predict the way the movie is going, however in this case I was thrown for a loop.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Purchased this trilogy for my husband for Christmas and it's three great movies, in really great packaging. I was impressed.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app and very useful on the go.  The Bible is God's word so how can you go wrong?  I would definetly recommend.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|The product came on time and works great. Thanks for being so awesome! We love buying our movies from you!
B004XWMXX8|5.0|My daughter loves this CD! Lots of dancing at our house. Nicely packaged, no problems, good price. Happy with this purchase.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I really liked Django Unchained, or as I like to call it: The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence right through the eyeball and then the bullet continued through about 7 other torsos, shot out from a guy's belly button bringing a plume of intestines with it, ricocheted off someone's jugular vein, then snapped the cord holding up a chandelier causing said chandelier to plummet like a lead balloon, crushing the skulls of various evil varmints and polecats and then plunging into an occupied outhouse where the dynamite was also stored, causing the outhouse to explode in a crimson rain of blood, guts and offal.<br /><br />But I guess all that wouldn't fit on the poster.<br /><br />  Django has everything you'd want in a movie, action, humor, suspense, drama, and even some romance, all washed down with gallons of blood. Did I mention some beautiful western vistas? it's got those too. And there are plenty of refernces to some of the geat westerns of the past, some of them only visual so pay attention. There is the trade mark Tarantino dialogue as well.<br /><br /> I'm sure other reviewers will talk about racial-political implications and social commentary and such. I'm not that smart. I just thought this was a fast paced and satisfying film for movie fans from beginning to end. Leonardo Di Caprio makes for a great villain, keeping himself just this side of over-the-top. Jamie Fox played Django as quiet waters that ran deep but Christopher Walz steals the show, although Samuel L. Jackson almost beat him to it.
B0083H6AQA|5.0|My daughter is a huge robert pattinson fan and she really enjoyed the movie she told me that it was one of his best films yet..so I would recommend this to anyone who loves robert pattinson and wants to see more of his movies.
B000FCK65W|5.0|Anna Quinlan writes a great forward for the kindle version and sums up this story so well; it is a story of human nature.  Incredible to think of life exactly 100 years ago.  Things were so different.  100 years from now? Makes me wonder!
B009UMTMKS|5.0|I wish this title had been available in 1999 when I worked in my first startup! Although pretty successful,  we made a lot of the mistakes articulated here!
B0034G4P80|5.0|The product came on time and works great. Thanks for being so awesome! We love buying our movies from you!
B005BDZN62|4.0|It felt like I was watching a DVD, there was grain every now and then. Not what you'd expect from Blu-ray. Overall, still a great movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|At 2 in the morning, when my mind is racing and I cannot sleep, I use this along with Pandora to get me to sleep. The settings are really customizable, and the playing is smooth. There are so many options to this game. awesome
B00005N6KG|5.0|Love these earphones. They are just the right size that fits my small ear. Most headphone ear pieces are too large to fit in my ears and falls out. Also, has Great sound that is crisp and clear. Love these headphone and will be ordering more!!
B00867GJYK|5.0|This movie will capture audiences of all ages. It doesn't have a wicked dark side like many f the other Disney movies. The constant movement and bright colors attracts younger kids. And mid young kids will like the dialogue exchanged between the fish it's fun and harmless. And if your a parent you'll like the fact the movie shows a dad who will stop at nothing to find his son. This is definitely one of my favorite Disney movies.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I thought that this was going to be a bunch of boring kid games.  NOT!!  Lots of fun games that actually require skill and coordination.  It gives you success, which keeps to wanting to play.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Very fun game to pass the time with! The free version is completely worth it. Cute graphics and bold colors.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Got this for my son for Christmas.  He loves the series & wishes it had not been canceled.  Serenity is the title of the movie that sums  up the ending.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|fun, tons of program levels to keep you flinging flyers forever. feel bad for the birds at times, need a big screen to enjoy the full experience (
B009RH9FR6|1.0|it is beautiful and sturdy but does not hold my kindle. I have the right sized one but it does not hold it.  There are much better kindle cases out there I would buy them instead. at least they work.
B008OHV5C8|5.0|Yes, I'm calling it an album, because that's the way you should listen to it... straight through. These guys keep pushing the boundaries and that is good for jazz specifically and music as a whole.<br /><br />Rock On!
B003TSEEDY|3.0|This book wasn't like I thought it would be! It was good but not great in my opinion. Onto the next
1400082773|1.0|Kinda hard to listen to or take advice from someone who's never accomplished anything (besides handing other people's money out).  Most politicians are narcissists, but this one's the poster child.<br /><br />The book was a slow read and I found myself questioning most everything he said, as he's contradicted some of the more reasonable tenets in the book in how he's handled the job he occupies now.  Hypocritical.<br /><br />Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  Hard to swallow the \\"preachy\\" stuff.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I purchased the complete game. Was well worth it. Loved the storyline, graphics, puzzles and HO games. I have purchased several G5 games and I have loved them all.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|great app . cost me too much . now a buy too much lol is a great addition to my kindle
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I just love this book!!! The story is great and I love how she tells Christian's point of view of their first meeting...she put out the books from his point of view!!!!
B002RKS81O|5.0|Such pretense on my part to rate a classic known to the world for nearly two centuries. Still, I can offer assurance to the hesitant reader that Austen never disappoints.<br />I do wish the pictures appeared in the Kindle edition, instead of merely the captions. I imagine they were wonderful old engravings.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Holy cow Colleen!  This is your best book yet!  Wow!  Super well written!  Great written story, despite how awful the situation.  I love all the characters!  I don't do spoilers so I will just say, you HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This game is fast paced and keeps me entertained for ages. I love the different levels. Great game for all ages.
B005LAII12|1.0|I'd give this movie a negative 50 stars if they let me! Now I know that I will get a lot of nasty comments about what I say in this review, but personally I DON'T CARE! This movie uses bad clones of overly recycled jokes that have been spewed from the bottom 1% of National Lampoon movies & the 4 dreadful direct to DVD American Pie films & worse yet, those are the movie's \\"good parts\\". Family Guy was funny in its original run but when it came back, the witty & quirky spirt was lost. But it still made money, lots of money! So now we have \\"Ted\\", either a cheep flick thats sole purpose is to make money or Seth MacFarlane is more stupid than I originally thought. The plot falls flat, the jokes are painfully predictable, you find yourself wanting it to be over less than halfway through the film etc... I know that there are many people out there who love this piece of trash, so I say to them, \\"Watch an older comedy movie & then reexamine your opinion on 'Ted'. And please, ignore the 'Hard-R' movies of the 90's.\\" The first American Pie film is a modern classic but it spawned a slew of crappy copy-cats. Try one of those basic cable classic-movie channels. From Abbott & Costello to Ferris Bueller, you can do much better than \\"Ted\\". If Justin Bieber is junk food for the mind, the \\"Ted' is arsenic for the mind!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|its a great gane i use on my phone and kindle but locks up sometime and then says it going to give me back my game tokens but never does then .hangs up with 10 or more bingos to go then boom the game is over . i think they fix that the game would be great
B004GHNIRK|5.0|It is great having this masterpiece on the kindle, where I can easily look up words which are not in my vocabulary and research terms and phrases on Wikipedia with a minor break in my reading.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It's what, 2:30? Gag, and I just started reading this around seven today. I didn't want to put it down. I've had to pee for the past two hours but I couldn't tear myself away. Great but, really sucks you in.
B002M5E2DW|4.0|Teaches the world the art of living in the fullness of life.<br />Very good and easy read will recommend to family
0425264351|2.0|There were really two main distractions.  First is that the author either did not know or did not care that commissioned officers in military police corps of the United States Army don't work as beat cops or homicide investigators. They are supervisors.  Military Police don't investigate homicides, that is done by the Army CID and not by commissioned officers but by either enlisted or warrant officer investigators.  The Second is that it is very difficult for an American reading about an American in America and being confronted with clearly British comments and phrases that are not part of the American English language.  Since the book is written in the first person we have Jack Reacher not knowing the American words \\"automatic transmission\\" but instead using \\"gear shifting device\\" in the Bentley (Bentley in Margrave, Georgia?).<br />Lots of coincidences that defy imagination but that is pretty common among thriller writers. But Jack commenting on the Israeli made .44 Eagle hand cannon as being something Israel gave us in exchange for the things we gave them?  Just factually incorrect, particularly from an author who apparently perceives himself as a gun enthusiast if not an expert.  These are easier to overlook than the basic structure of the Military Police, a threshold foundational premise upon which the author had an obligation to strive for greater truth.
072325804X|5.0|I bought this from a wish list on Amazon. The price (including shipping!) was very reasonable, compared to in-store prices. The print and illustrations when fantastic! It will be something that will last a long time, and be treasured as the collection of Beatrix Potter should be. Definitely will recommend more gift purchases done this way! :-)
B007N5YIUS|4.0|my 5 year old finished the original angry birds so we got him the seasons and space games.  the space one seems to be really challenging.  lots of ads, but thats what you get for it being free
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is the Mitch Rapp that we all know and love.  He has another meeting with the man who killed his wife and unborn child.  The Washington insiders surely do deserve some torture or at least an outing of their infitmities and egos.  Give it a try.
B0086700CM|5.0|it makes me want to come back again and again. its a little addicting, so don't say I didn't warn you
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|As usual Nicholas Sparks knows how to fill your heart with joy and tears at once. A must read for any wife or mother.
B008OOYALE|4.0|It keeps me somewhat entertained when I'm bored though it doesn't seem to be much other than feeding n breeding dragons.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|kids love this movie, and it also relates to an adult audience with the comedy.<br />The seller was extremely helpful. I'd recommend this movie to anyone. Good story behind the movie.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|though honestly I should probably give 'em thanks for weaning me off of FB. the newsfeed never shows in its entirety and usually I just get annoyed and give up.
B00009UTQD|5.0|I bought this to carry some filters in my camera bag, and to eliminate the original hard plastic cases.<br />You could even carry filters in their original cases, but this pack will protect them well either way.<br />It is large for a filter case, but built like a tank. It also can be carried on a strap or even a belt, using the loop in back.<br />The divisions are softly lined, and the dividers are very sturdy, and deep enough for any filter I may carry.<br />If you have the room in your bag, and want to organize at least 5 filters this item will work well.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|It stinks like poo<br /><br />Kfkfkkfjfkkkfkfkf<br /><br />Sseeerrdreeddrfdddd<br />Ass do not have a major problem with the thing about the same time as a result in an interview. Goofball  football team of scientists are not  the only thing that is a good thing about the new version of scientists. Food and the same way that is a result in the only one that has been a good thing about it. Football is like mixed martial arts and improved brain injury to the beer sand. It stinks like poo and improved business. The first and second half of scientists are not responsible for the new version of scientists. Football team is like mixed wit and the same way that is a good idea to the beer in the hockey hall.<br />Football expert SanDisk stinks like mixed martial arts and political parties. The football may cause brain injury to the beer sand dunes. The dunes of sand look like poo on Abe Lincoln memorial day of scientists and the same way that has been a major part of its own site and improved business owners. I really don't want to be the only thing about the beer and second half of scientists and improved brain injury to the beer sand and Sandusky so I really don't care.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Well I really liked everything about this book/ dictionary really good for the children to read. To get started in everything and thank you New Oxford
B007N85ZXY|5.0|I am a big fan of Neil Young. The way he took these old songs,of whichI haven't heard since 1964 , and basically rewrote them, was fantastic
B002RI9PKO|3.0|It is a factual book so you need to be in that frame of mind when you pick it up. It has a lot of interesting ideas, however there were times when I considered the information obvious when Gladwell was trying to deliver it as a revelation. He has a good style of mixing the statistical data he is trying to get across with light anecdotes and case studies.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I had my doubts but found it funny throughout but especially the 1st 3 quarters of the movie.<br />. .
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|To be half the man he was would be a great achievement for the rest of us. A very good read.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This book was very funny. It was also a very good page turner and I could not stop reading it.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|I thought it was a great book.  I hope the author makes more of this series.  This was the best book the author has wrote.
B005LAII0I|5.0|If you are looking for a cute movie that can be watched as a family this is it. I bought this for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas but truth be told I've watched it as much as she has. The &#34;Puppy Love&#34; scene is hillarious!
B007BVT5N4|5.0|OMG BEST BOOK EVER. LOVEEEEE U JUSTIN!! Thanks for err very thing u rock!!! , definitely read this book!  For sure!
B000HT3JNY|5.0|I really like this movie it reminds me of the movie a Christmas Carol but with a modern day twist to it. Plus it's hilarious.
B002SAUCBC|3.0|Well the ending was not quite what I was prepared for even though I was gearing myself up for some Stephen King type finish which usually doesn't end too well for the main characters.<br />I almost feel like I'm speaking blasphemy by saying this because Stephen King is my idol. Hee hee
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book had me on my seat, waiting for the turn of every page! I could not let go of the book. I can't wait to read the other books!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book, it's a quick but deep read that's especially relevant to teens. It was enlightening to be able to completely inhabit the narrator of Charlie and live a second life vicariously through him, regardless of the few similarities in the events of our lives. It was in a way more rewarding to experience a life far different from mine yet still connected, making me wonder the 'infinity' of life itself.
0679805273|5.0|Most people know what a great book this to use as a graduation gift.  I plan to do the same but I purchased it now and am having my son's teachers each sign it for him.  I thought it would be fun to look back and see what each teacher had to say about him all the way back to preschool.  I don't know how I'll do it once he's in high school and has several teachers...maybe just get his favorites to sign?  I'll have to see how much room is left by then.  It's a great book that can be turned into a precious keepsake for your child.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is one of the things that will leave a mark in my childhood (this is helping me get through middle school I'm 13) very well explained and overall an awesome book (THANKS JEFF KINNEY)
B001AQT0RC|5.0|Love this sci-fi film. Just the thought of actually talking to another being from another star let alone a message from one is mind boggling. Just to let us know we are not alone out there in the universe. Any sci- fi fan would like this movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Sky was such a strong character.  She was tortured, potentially broken but so emotional strong in the end.  Holder  was yummy, guilt ridden and did I mention...yummy.  I read this book in one day.  So many twists and turns.  The. Secondary characters were well written and well developed.  I wanted to know more about Holder's mom.  She would have known the back story and I wanted to know her take everything.  READ. THIS. BOOK.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book had me intrigued the whole time. I'm definitely excited for the movie and even more excited to read the next book&lt;3
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|im a cheap guy i dont like buying apps. seems like a waste of money cause they get boring and have no replay value. but this is awesome step up from other bloons . new towers game modes maps and characters its crazy. just buy it ill give u guys the three dollars
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I cannot stop reading this book! It is so good! I would  recommend it to everyone. Trust me you won't be able to put the book down!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the movie but the book is even better. I would recommend this book to all my family and friends.
B000VDDWE2|5.0|Very interesting movie. Opens your eyes about the possibilities of global warming and what the effects might be if we don't deal with this soon, instead of brushing it under the rug. I hate seeing how humanity only responds to issues and coming together to fix these issues after the fact they happen. Great movie if you haven't seen yet buy. Fantastic movie.
B008WCP2PG|2.0|after a few scenes,  seemed like oh boy another stripper dance number.  first or second was like<br />yeah they are doing a good job this is probably like you would see in a male or gay bar.  Just too many<br />numbers not enough story. Sure the ladies will give it 10 stars just because of the almost nude<br />dance numbers but found it boring here.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is great awesome to play and loose hours upon hours in this game..'. But the multi player doesn't work very well the log in page is very buggy for me I can't even search for game when I'm connected. But over all this game is very great I recommend this game to any one who loves dogs.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|One of the bigger games I've played on my Kindle. The tutorial is slightly overwhelming at first but after that the game is fun. I have not run into the game breaking glitch other reviewers have mentioned.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|A confirmation of the strength of the human spirit. Parts of the story are improbable, but forgivable when viewed in the context of creating a dream worthy connection between the main characters. You will find yourself considering the depth and power of love, the bounds of grace, and the promise of hope. A good read.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I would recommend this game to anyone. This was first time with Angry Birds and I love the game. Its very relaxing.  I like the different levels.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This is a GREAT TV show!  I'm only sorry Andy Whitfield died before they could make any more shows.  The second and third seasons are wonderful, too, but this is the best.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I highly recommend it. The story is original. The characters feel like real people and the art work is amazing. Strong work.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I loved The King's Speech. It's a reminder that we all have problems and we can all persevere and overcome them, especially when they are the obstacles we place in our own way. I think it is impossible to describe this movie without spoiling it a bit, but in general terms, the movie is about King George VI of England who suddenly ascends to the throne and is expected to be the public face of his nation as a confrontation with Hitler becomes inevitable. The only problem, of course, is that the new king stammers horribly and instead of rousing and audience's passions, causes only an acute sense of embarrassment in his listeners. Out of desperation, he turns to an odd Australian speech therapist who helps the fledgeling monarch cope with issues deeper than his speech defect.<br /><br />There are some historical issues. Notably, Churchill is portrayed as an ally of King George VI when he was an ardent supporter of Edward VIII until the position became untenable. These are minor issues in an otherwise excellent historical drama.Highly recommend.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Finished this one quickly. Reads well and doesn't lose you in too much unnecessary information. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a detailed account of the raid.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is my very favorite game. I would recommend this game to anyone. I play it several times a week and its very relaxing.
B000VXLC3K|5.0|One of the albums best epitomizing the 70s.  Love it!  It's a classic for good reason, and you won't be disappointed if you buy it.
B0067R0APK|5.0|I use this app every day and sometimes several times a day. It has all the information I need, well presented.
B002S0OBMS|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect at first but the songs sound exactly like the ones from the play! I love it so much!
B007MB5OCE|3.0|I just don't get all the praise for this book. It's like another Forrest Gump, but not so original anymore.
145210655X|5.0|A very cute book for any Star Wars fan!  It has great illustrations and came in excellent shape!  A good deal!
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I admit that I was at first reluctant to watch \\"Django Unchained\\" because I was unsure if I was going to be able to handle all of the movie scenes. However, I instantly changed my mind when one of my younger sisters treated me to the film on Christmas day.  The film was better than I imagined and includes some of the following characters pivotal to the plot: Kerry Washington as the emotionally tough slave Brumhilda, meanwhile Jamie Foxx and Christopher Waltz brilliantly play a strong tag team via the roles of Django and Dr. King Schulz.  Leonardo Dicaprio plays a wealthy plantation owner by the name of Calvin Candie while Samuel Jackson plays his crafty assistant Stephen. Dicaprio and Jackson play evil men, but in all fairness, both men also performed their roles in a superb fashion. Quentin Tarantino also makes an appearance in \\"Django Unchained.\\" \\"Django Unchained\\" is a good movie for those who like unconventional western films.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I have not eaten a \\"beef burger\\" at a fast food restaurant since I've seen this film.  I had no idea that I would be so affected by this film. Some of the video that they show in regard to the cattle standing all day, most of their lives in their own waste was just disgusting to the core.  This is a must see movie if you care about your health or have children.  It goes a lot deeper than what I just mentioned as far a the causes of diabetes, and a host of other \\"newer\\" health challenges that are plaguing our modern society.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Huge 30 rock and Tina Fey fan but this book was clearly written for women.  I'm fine with that, and there were some parts that I can relate to in my marriage.  At times, Tina gets a bit preachy.  The chapters about SNL and 30 Rock were a lot of fun to read though.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Love the tap feature.  Also like that there is a 3-suit option, since I've mast<br />ered the 2-suit level but never get far with the 4-suit.level.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Itwas a gift for my daughter.  She loves this show. She loves me now to.  I got a good deal.
B002984AJI|5.0|I've wanted this on vinyl for awhile, but each time I remembered about it and had tried to buy it, it was sold out. I was finely able to get my grubby hands on a vinyl copy and this album sounds beautiful. I'm happy I waited for this version and didn't settle for the CD or mp3's.
B006X5L6VS|5.0|I have the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this app is wondeful.  With the built in GPS this makes the app finally worth getting.  My son loves this and uses it at night along with his telescope to find planets and constellations.  Very easy to use and has a night mode .  Great for kids and lots of fun on clear nights.
B000PXUA5W|4.0|Cute watch. Wish the plastic was a little more thicker like Lego bricks. I like that you're able to change out the watch bands.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|My family watches this movie several times during the Christmas holidays.  It warms the heart.  Too bad there are not more movies like it.  We love it!
B003L77G6A|5.0|My daughter is happier than I ever seen.  She loves this show.  Now she can watch every episode in her bedroom.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|A classic to be sure.  Recommended for readers of all ages.  This is a novel which teaches an emphatic lesson in caring for the needs of the less fortunate.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|Great game but once again you need to spend real money to open up many of the store items.  Also you can visit a random player but all you can do is look and not get any coins like you can with friends.  Also the random player is always the SAME random player every time.
B0062OCNAI|5.0|Wonderful wonderful book. I could not put it down, read it cover to cover and the ending was super and such a surprise.
0375826742|5.0|This is the third in the series I have purchased for my grandson.  He is only 11 and I am amazed that he is so excited to read such a large book!  He finds this series as &#34;really cool&#34;.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|It was a gift for my daughter she loves the show.  She love me now too!  I got a good deal.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|The Case Cover looks nice and my granddaughter loved the pink.<br />It does what it was intended to do, cover the Kindle.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|On the new kindle fire hd 8.9 this app is even beter than ever.  Enable your gps and the ap will do the rest for you.  Great for kids.  My son checks the moon every day and loves the countdown to the next full moon.
B0002RQ2T4|5.0|5 STARS because this is another creative anime,this is a 2 DVD SET.Here are some nice extras also.This is well made and interesting.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|It is a cute game.....has a real trouble with lagging when it's getting used....this causes a little frustration, but overall okay game to play....
B000W91RUG|5.0|It was a gift for my daughter she loves this show.  She loves me now to.  I got a good deal.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was afraid when I started reading it that it would be boring. A 17 year love story and I am over 40 but it completely surprised me. Love is ageless. Sadness, happiness, love, and hate are all emotions you feel in the book. You will find yourself trying to guess the ending but you won't see what is coming. Would love to give details but it would ruin it for you. Just read it. It is a great book that will become a part of you. READ IT!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|What a shocking way to begin a book!  And the surprises just keep coming.  This was another great collaboration!  I loved it.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|Warm and endearing story and beautiful cinematography.  Good family entertainment.  We really enjoyed this.  Amazon HD video quality was quite good.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The best of the Batman so far.....Ann Hathaway was just amazing to watch......can't wait for the next one......bring on the dynamic duo.....
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Shes really happy with now having all seasons to watch now.  I'm a hero in my house.  About time for that.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to instal,lots of fun to play. Everyone in the family uses it. Always a challenge and it has a great layout.
0765365278|5.0|Like many WOT fans, I was disappointed by Sanderson's portrayal of Matt Cauthon following Robert Jordan's death. But, I thought I'd give Mr. Sanderson the benefit of the doubt. Elantris was ok, but nothing special. The Mistborn trilogy was much better, but I still wouldn't put the series at the same level as Jordan, Martin, Brooks, Eddings, or Weis & Hickman. With The Way of Kings, Sanderson has created a rich new world with detailed characters that I've really gotten into. Can't wait for the next one!
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I had really high expectations for this score and to some degree they were met. Although the singing wasn't perfect, the emotions were conveyed and in some songs better such as from \\"I Dreamed A Dream.\\" I think Jackman's voice is a little too screechy throughout, Crowe's too growling and inflowing at times, Marius's (Eddie's) too whiny, and Cohen's too inebriated. I also wish this included the full album because I would pay extra for the set. I still prefer the 25th anniversary concert at the O2 but this movie would be something I would watch and own.<br /><br />I also wish the lyrics stayed consistent with the concert and that some songs weren't cut off but the movie did well with the time constraint of under 3 hours.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this album because it only is $5 ($3 for me since I got $2 credit on fandango for purchasing my tickets online!) and the songs with the entire cast (such as the \\"Do You Hear The People Song?\\" reprise at the end of \\"Epilogue\\") are great.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Action,start to finish. Just when you think you know what's going to happen next, something different comes in. Was riveted until the last page. Highly recommended.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed reading this story as seen through the dogs eyes. Great life lessons to be learned by everyone .
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry Bosch does it again.  Fantastic writing all the way through.  Ready for the next one!  Loved all the history and definition of Los Angeles.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|I feel that since this movie obviously has no complete ending that it should have been free or a cheaper renting price. There are a few new characters of which most died in the first place, but this was the same violence that I expected, from beginning to the end. When the next movie comes out after this and we all know that there will be another one, please make sure the renting or buying price actually fits the character of the movie.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This is a truly amazing book! I ABSOLUTELY recommend it to anyone who wishes to read it! It actually inspires me to be a better person and to reach out to those who need help(:
B007FJFDXS|5.0|It's a great game as long as you go into options and choose the arrows as your way of moving. Great gameplay and absolutely no glitches. Great for free!
0307716988|5.0|I bought it for my grandson for Christmas.  I started reading it before I wrapped it.  It's in MJ's own words.  I could hear his voice as I was reading.  Easy to read, great pictures and a ton of memories flooded my mind. I can't wait to borrow it from my grandson now.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone at any age.  Miss you Michael!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Free download the up ally typically you see end up in this blog is I have already done by the end up all the end of Eri the new year and a chance for shared with the new version of Eri housing to downtown and colleagues from the new version
B006O6F932|5.0|I read reviews before i purchased this for my son, and I was worried about two things: the sturdiness of the second floor and that you couldn't sit the dolls on any of the furniture easily.  Someone also said that the floor isnt level and stuff fell over.  I can now report that I have not had a problem with any of that! Yeah!  The second floor holds many dolls at a time, the furniture is amazing! The desks are easy to put dolls in and they stay no problem at all.  Some things I've had to superglue together (the cart and table) so they stay put together.<br /><br />I'm so glad that I bought this school, it has me down on the floor playing.  I'm mostly putting everything back in order (it's my OCD).  But all the details and little locks and drinks and notebooks and pens,  it's just so much fun to get into!
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|This had me and my girl Laughing Out Loud.  I was pleasantly surprised with this movie.  The fact that a movie about a talking teddy bear had a decent plot and story line (adult) was a unique.  You WILL absolutely laugh while watching this movie.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|No lag and smooth controls. Great for 7 dollars. You should get it by all means! More coming later for this app.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|Here is my personal guarantee: Buy this friggin' amazing rockumentary. Buy it now,brothers and sisters. Skip reading all these long ass reviews. &#34;But Dave&#34; ...&#34;What about your guarantee?&#34;  Right..that...OK, here it is. Buy the DVD, watch it twice. If you don't like it..send it back and I will send back any of your money that I haven't spent already on Sex, Drugs, and Rock N Roll!! Seriously folks..this is the new Gold Standard for filming a rock concert. Enjoy.
B000FC10WU|5.0|Good read for a cold evening alond the lines of the typical Agatha novel! I enjoyed the book and would recommend!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Not the type of book l usually read  it once l got into it l didn't want to put it down.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Great from beginning to end. Edge of your seat action, great plot and story and ties all things together. But you already know that.
B0032FPVKE|4.0|Bag is great nothing wrong with product. I wish it was a little bigger but other wise is great. maybe offer in different color.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was a really good book I will probably read it again  and I will make my brothers read it to when they are older:)$10<br />  -Kate the Great
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put the book down. Quick way read. Characters well developed, story line flows. Can't wait for the next one.
B009S8PEHY|4.0|Rod Stewart's voice was made to sing these classic Christmas songs -- which would would never think possible.  Well done.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome read ....didn't suspect what was going to happen...can't wait to read the last book...love this book series ... want more books like it
B007THA4FI|2.0|My book club picked this novel to read, based solely on the reputation of the author.  In my opinion, this novel is an unhappy, vulgar novel made up of trite characters using trite elements of conflict.<br />There are so many characters that it is hard to keep track of them without keeping a chart.  The characters were very umsympathetic - the author seemed to emphasize the worst personaliity traits of pretty predictable characters.  Yes, there is irony at the end - the least liked character turns out to be a hero at her death.<br />There are quite a few unanswered questions at the end, but unfortunately, I didn't even care if they were answered or not.<br />At times, the author uses some effective literary elements (metaphors and similes) and some visualizations.  I understand that this novel is based on characters the author knew in real life, and that she wanted to write an \\"adult\\" novel.  It didn't appeal to me.
B0098VXDDS|4.0|The main star died after a battle with cancer, so if you're confused that's why we have a new star. Still a great show baby!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Very fun its similar to Mario. A great free game for our kindle and ipods. My 9 yr old loves it.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|This movie was entertaining all the way through.  Each characters' emotions and actions were portrayed well by the actors.  It was pretty brutal and gritty at times, so I would recommend certain younger people not be allowed to watch it.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good and entertaining movie.
B009HELT3C|5.0|This is a very entertaining movie, has a great back story to it.  Tommy Lee Jones did a great job.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|This was much better than I expected. It takes a few shots just to let you know it ISN'T Glee and isn't trying to be. At times it feels a bit like a spoof, but the majority of the time it is just a good comedy.
B008Y6SA36|5.0|When compared to other films in the genre, one would be hard pressed to find 1 or 2 that are superior. Highly recommend this film and don't worry if you never played the video game. This film stands on its own merit.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|A great hero who doesnt hold back.  Just the way you want your heros to be.  This book is a big dose of revenge and the bad guys dont stand a chance.  The author keeps you hooked from chapter to chapter.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you love minecraft  your awesome<br />Please press yes<br />Oh my name's Cole Lewis warren<br />Hey girls once again your awesome
B0057RCFQS|5.0|I have the VHS copy and no longer have a VHS.  I love these shows.  So now with my Christmas gift from my brother, I was able to order the trilogy for myself.  These shows are worth watching.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Walking Dead continues with beautiful photography, complex plot lines and suspense!  Renting episodes is a great option for those of us with no cable who miss our weekly showings at a friend's house!  :)
B0040X46TE|5.0|Looked everywhere for this particular song that my husband loved and the one here was great and at the right price.
B007KOMTUI|4.0|If you're cheering for Don to grow up then you'll be satisfied, but that is also what makes this season not as compelling as the previous seasons where you just couldn't wait to find out what is next.  Not unusual for a series in several seasons, though.  Regardless, I am looking forward to season 6.
1451696191|4.0|Purchased this book too quickly for my young teen daughter without reading a review. I now feel that I may have to read it first to decide if it is age appropriate. Heard it was an excellent book.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I liked this version of snow white, but then I thought Kristen Stewart did a good job on it.  I've watched it several times.
B001AQO3QA|3.0|Although I have seen all the &#34;Alien&#34; movies, I was looking forward to seeing them on blu-ray. When I inserted the first disc a message appeared that said the software in my blu-ray player was not compatible for these discs and that I need a software update. I've had my player a couple of years so when I went to Insignia's website, it said my player was discontinued and there was no update available. So, I guess I'll wait until I get a new player to watch these discs.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very addictive.  When you start out you think this ok, but once I got into it you want to keep playing. I playing it at work one day my lunch buddies wanted to know what I was playing so I let them try it, now they all are downloading and hooked.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Some of the reviews said it scarred up the back with the rings, so I made sure I had a back film. So no scars on mine. The look is nice and clear, can't tell what the material is just by looking at it, but is definately silicone/rubber. Really shows of the iphone look. I ordered a plain black for skin and decals though cause of the spirals (by the way, they're on the inside, outhside is smooth). All the portals have nice access, although I don't dock mine so I can't really coment on that. Bought 2 amazonbasic Items so far, and each time the quality earned a 5 star. Also, if you don't like the logo on back, it easily rubs/scratches off.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down. it was a great book. I can't wait for the next book to come out.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I like the Avenger movies, just like I liked the transformer movies. I've watched it several times, because I've enjoyed it so much.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like a game that offers a challenge every time I play it and this one keeps me coming back!
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|This movie had its moments but overall wasn't as funny as I had hoped. As usual it seems the trailers show the best parts
B008Y5OW20|5.0|If you're a Jeff Lynne fan, then you'll love Long Wave. This is his long-awaited masterpiece. It brings back ELO in places and showcases Jeff's voice in a way that Armchair Theatre didn't (good as that album was). I might add that, IMHO, the first song &#34;She,&#34; beautiful and poetic, is good enough to buy the CD for by itself.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This movie is about 2 1/2 hours long but it seems short as the movie is the best movie out for rental.
1423140591|5.0|This is part of my husbands favorite series.  So I just keep getting them for him.  Eventially I will read them.
B009JBZH54|4.0|Item arrived on time, and was as advertised. Item was purchased for my son at Christmas, but I will give it to him at a later date. I was pleased with this item because it offered my son all three Batman movies at, what I felt, was a discount. Especially when combined with the extra features.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Got this game for my granddaughter's Kindle Fire for Christmas. She loves playing it. Great graphics, great game!!  She has ordered more Angry Bird Games Since then.
B004QL7K6G|4.0|I gave it to my boyfriend who had it on his &#34;gift list&#34;.  He loved it, and so did I, although I thought it had a little too much nudity.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This has got to be one of the funniest movies around!! ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I  never  liked the show Dark Shadows that was on TV, but this movie was awesome.  Even my husband loved it.  We saw it at the drive-in and I wanted to buy it.  I'll watch it several times over.  It is a great, funny movie.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Grand kids loved playing this game. This is an easy game for them to play. I would down load similar games also.
1432794426|5.0|Dr. Moriarty's extensive efforts and research are made obvious in this tribute to The King of Pop. I really enjoyed this book- what a great celebration of such a wonderful life!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Especially in these troubled times, the entire series acts as a window into possible futures that there is still time for our society to avoid. With fast action, believable and lovable characters and depth, the books lead the reader forward...at once afraid to know and wanting to know what will come next.  As food for thought, The Mockingjay and the entire series leave no one hungry.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|To bad this show is ending soon this show is awesome!! I hope they come up with another underground drug show.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Easy to use and Google is my search engine of choice.  And it was a free app which makes it even better!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My grand kids enjoy playing this game on my Kindle. It keeps them entertained. It is an easy and fun game.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I really love this game because it's simple, yet there are many options when you're styling the hair. It doesn't freeze up and I haven't had any problems with the game not working. It's definitely worth the money!
B007QPFGJW|5.0|This is an excellent investigative crime narrative featuring policeman, Harry Hole, which takes place in a dark, narcotics crime ridden Oslo underworld where political corruption, drugs, addiction and violence are commonplace.  Harry has lost the woman he loves, yet returns to free her son, Oleg, who is jailed for murder.  The narrative is brilliant with twists, unusual turns and a stepping stone path of clues that unravel cleverly.  Harry has a sordid past and a previous weakness for alcohol addiction. Harry is not pretty, yet he is clever, brave and industriously effective.  Violence is commonplace.  The mood is dark and sinister.  The characters are nightmarishly developed. The ending is brilliant. This is a good read similar to DENNIS LEHANE.  Tighten your seat belts you won't be able to put it down!
B0015AARJI|5.0|Great Product! Arrived on time with no hassle. I would recomeend this product for any PS3 user.<br />It is lighter than the original controller that came with the system.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love, love, love this app!  Did all my Chrislmas lists; for presents per person, grocery for each of the many holiday events, Things to Do for preppring for the holidays!  So glad I heard about it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Really like playing this game.Easy,fast and fun to play.Would get other games like this one. Grand kids enjoy this one also.
B002VLNB1Q|5.0|John mayer is truly a musical genious and I would highly recommend all of his music not just Battle Studies. His music is enjoyable to many musical tastes though the focal point is usually a jazzy alternative type of music.
B005LAII80|3.0|If you've seen [[ASIN:B0085A9HXS The Raid: Redemption [Blu-ray]]] then you're going to find the storyline familiar. Basically, Dredd and his rookie partner get stuck in a building with an insane drug warlord and have no way out. You can pretty much guess the rest.<br />Personally I like The Raid Redemption better, but this film is still fun to watch. No awesome bone breaking martial arts, rather, all gunplay.<br />It's a solid 3.5 stars for any fan of action. Can't compare it to the actual comic book character because I've never read it. All I have to reference this to is the Stallone version and that was pure cheese.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|As addictive as any bejeweled clone, but unlike most this one is actually pleasing to the eye.  There's  a decent variety of powerups and some obstacles to keep the game challenging, as well as different grid formations. So yeah pretty good game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|great game for all kids and adults love it and it is so cool.cant believe how fun it is. AWESOME
B005HSL626|5.0|My grand kids and I enjoy playing this game. I would down load similar games like this one. Thanks again.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This a great deal and fits perfect with kindle fire no better deal on this anywhere Trust me I price shopped all over internet
B007N8RULO|4.0|Just can't seem to leave this game alone but the ads drive me to distraction.  The game is much harder to win using four suits.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Amazing movie. All I was left thinking- please let there be a sequel!<br />Great cast, singing is really good. Just an overall well done movie that's fun.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I write with partiality given that the movie takes place on the familiar grounds of both North Carolina and Georgia.  Yes it starts off bleak and I certainly could have done without some of the visuals and 'gd' inserts but it ended well and left me smiling.  Was it the beautiful scenery of the southern Appalachian Mountains?  Was the struggles, not so uncommon, between the Father and Daughter? Was it the happier feel good ending? Or what it the less obvious lessons between egos and relationships? What it seeing the jerks justifiably meet their end while the more noble got recognition?  I almost could feel the sense of freedom that the daughter experiences as she tosses her phone into the dumpster.  And I could certainly related to the freedom that both Father and Daughter feel through forgiveness and moving forward.  I do not know what all took place to make their relationship so tumultuous.  Maybe it was just trouble with the curve.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun game to play. Easy also. Grand kids love it. Would get similar games like this one to download. on my Kindle.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Great back pack with full capacity to carry a notebook and other useful items while traveling made of a strong durable material,
B009X01ELC|4.0|Having bought the Kindle Fire 8.9\\" HD, I needed a stand to help read it at night, in bed or at the table.<br /><br />This cover is well built, fairly priced, and does exactly what it should. The convenience of being able to rotate the device within the cover allows it to be propped upright oR sideways. The rotation also allows the slot for the connections to be accessible from the outside. This design is far superior - IMHO - than covers that have a \\"flap\\" that extends to allow the cover to stand.<br /><br />It also has a strap designed to enable an easier grip on the cover and to allow for one handed use.<br /><br />Nice cover, I like it a lot. The only flaw is the weight of the cover. Because it has the rotational piece, it is a bit heavier than other covers. Not sure how you could get around that and still have a quality cover. Worth buying.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|The music and singing in this film is great, I highly recommend the soundtrack. The film itself is lacking. The plot seems half assed though Rebel Wilson is quite funny in the role of Fat Amy.
B001706I5I|5.0|We enjoy this movie so much as a family. Makes everyone laugh. I catch myself looking over at my little ones just to take in the joy that is on their little faces when we watch this one. Jim Carey is hilarious.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Rocked this for years, always brings back some great memories. And it never gets too old to give it another spin.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Enya.....there is not much else to say. She out did herself with this album. Have given many as gifts. Outstanding!!!
B006AN78XS|5.0|I purchased this DVD as a give away for a Parisian-themed party, and it was a wonderful prize for my guests!
B005F3XV62|5.0|zookeeper,with kevin james exelent,they shipped on time,the product was in good quality,and not damaged.I would recomend this company with good conchance
B002JWD6AS|5.0|It's better than Twilight! 8<br />It took me to a different world while reading it!<3<br />l suggest this teens and young adults.
B00503BN1M|3.0|Felt like I was watching Friends with Benefits again (same story line)......albeit with different casts. Nothing original about it. Knew what would happen just by looking at the title lol.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|Loreena McKennitt has written and recorded a beautiful album. It has bcome one of my favorites. Also, I have given it as gifts and always get rave reviews.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I had heard great things about this book, and I'm so glad I picked it up. The author doesn't try to make herself into a hero; she's just incredibly honest about who she is and was and the journey she had to take. The story is beautifully written, the prose edging into poetry, and the emotional and physical journey is breathtaking and exciting.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book made me feel so many emotions all at once. I felt so sympathetic at times, but happy for hope/sky because she has holder who truly loves her and will always be there for her. I loved how strong she was, through it all. I could never be that strong if I were to go through what she did. And for holder and sky to have such a strong connection just makes me happy. How the name \\"Sky\\" ties in to it all is clever. I seriously loved this book because it brings out so much emotion, more emotion than any other book I've ever read. I could read it over and over again. It was intense. The relationship Holder and Sky has makes this book beautiful, it amazes me how people so young can live so much. I'm writing this as if it is real, but it felt real as I was reading. The emotions felt real.  Thank you for writing this book.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|At times the book seemed to bore me but I would keep reading. It has amazing quotes to take away and it really makes you feel. Feel normal, feel blessed. I'd recommend this book for all ages.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|Loved this movie. However, if you get squeamish at the sight of too much blood, then this might not be for you. Otherwise, I'd definitely recommend this movie.
0545265355|5.0|Bought this for my daughter for a Christmas present.  Exceptional packaging.  My only complaint is that it arrived one day late.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It's an awesome book probably the best book Jeff Kenny made! I am an 12 year old still reading this series/genre! I totally recommend this book. Great buy!
B004Q7IAQE|3.0|This Hello Kitty was purchased for my daughter from her son.  She loves Hello Kitty and collects the smaller ones.Did not realized that it was so large.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK. ITS FUNNY , ENTERTAINING,AND JUST PERFECT. SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? Pick up this book.
B000VS70XQ|3.0|This was a gift for my nephew. I found the synopsis intriguing, I will have to read the book myself. I would recomend it to any science fiction fan. I was surprised when I went to wrap it that it was an obviously used copy. I thought Amazon didn't send used copies unless you checked that box, which I'm sure I didn't. It  was a little embarassing when my nephew opened it.
B002ZFQD04|1.0|When I recived this merchandise, I put in my dvd player, the cd said me error disk.  I put in additional dvd and my laptop said me the same message.  At this moment is not possible see the dvd.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|If you like the movie you will love the soundtrack.  It is very addictive.  Makes me want to see the movie again.  The soundtrack does have one drawback.  It highlights the weakness of Hugh Jackman's singing.  It did not bother me during the movie but I want to skip it on the soundtrack.  Way too high and warbly (not sure if that's a word, but it describes it perfectly).
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is lots of fun.  A similar game to Angry Birds and just as much fun.  Lots of fun to play.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game its one of the awesomest games ever . soooo fun!!!!!! win prides, level up, win coins!!!!!!  :-D
B00005Y23E|3.0|I Love the music but both CD's have almost the same music on them, even the same song on one CD twice.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|After reading reviews online of Kindles, I was under the impression that there was no way to read pdf. files...<br />After downloading this app., pdf. files display perfectly...
B0094BB4TW|5.0|When I first downloaded it was only showing about 10 items then no more. It's finally fixed and it works wonderfully letting me continue to scroll. Yay!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|GREAT! Such a great love story and thrilling at the same time.I  encourage young readers to read this for a great love story!
B007M45PMU|5.0|is going to go places. They have a great sound, and their music a catchy and upbeat. I predict them going far!
B008TMA1LY|4.0|Both my girls love this game it challenges you to remember the order and to get it to the customer in a timely fashion.  Also, it's Hello Kitty one of their favorite characters.
B005UDD1R6|3.0|the product does OK at what files it'll handle... I was hoping for it would convert .wmv files,,, it won't...<br />or, if it will, I don't know how to do it... so, it really didn't help me...
B005LAIHZY|5.0|It was bought for my young niece for a Christmas present. She was very happy and loved her new movie.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|The newsfeed only shows a few posts, then there are these weird blue blocks that you can't even click. I'd rather not even use the app because of this. Hopefully it will be fixed with an update soon.
B002APU580|5.0|The Acting is superb for this cinematic masterpiece. The director was true to the novel and Austen's piece shines in this movie!
B0086700CM|4.0|This game can get to be addictive.  But its so fun and can be fun for all ages and genders.  it challenges and keeps getting harder as you advance in the game so it doesn't get boring.
B00846REIS|1.0|Poor character development, boring sex scenes, and overall poorly written. Don't waste your time or money on this erotic wannabe.
B008UTV6S8|5.0|I saw him in concert almost a year ago in the Chicago area...and then this album came out.  Loved the concert and loved getting a CD of what was essentially the same concert I attended...only later than mine.  Glad it came out.
B007SGM084|5.0|I couldn't stop reading and I am not a reader! These books were fabulous! I think I was very well sexually educated also!
B00AODKSAA|3.0|Call me crazy or undiscriminating, but this book was so much fun!  I enjoyed the storyline, the hero's mentor, and it's such an over the top premise that it actually works.  Biggest problem: Abe's weapon of choice is an axe.  Vampires are supernaturally fast and axes are not.  No matter how hard Lincoln practices, it's not credible that he wages war with vamps using an axe.  Swords were available then, as well as bows and arrows, stakes, fire, and pistols with special bullets.  I loved the ending, and didn't see it coming, though I should have.  The unfortunate movie went straight to DVD, and everyone pronounced it an instant bomb. Not unexected.  No matter, the novel was a glorious romp through decapitated vampire heads, and Lincoln's obsessive hunt for these repulsive vampires was entertaining to follow.
B006OITIQE|5.0|This is such a fun song and they are the latest boy band.  For my girls thats a win/win combination.  We like to sing the 1D songs they are fun and full of energy.
B00076RT24|5.0|Star Wars is a great movie, and Episode I was the first one I ever saw (and I saw it in the theaters).
B008LZHA3G|5.0|And he keeps writing songs and playing the music.  I'm a groupie for his Never-Ending Tour, so buying the most recent CD is something towards which I looked forward.  Always nice to get it in the mail and removed the plastic.  Then playing it.  Ah!  Listen to that Duquesne whistle blow!  Perfect!  I put that one on repeat and listen to it hour after hour.  Life is good as long as this guy keeps playing music.  A winner!
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is totally addicting! I keep playing to get a higher score.  My whole family has downloaded it.  We have tournaments.  Great no violence for all!
B0063IH60K|5.0|easy play, would recommend to others great to use when away from your computer or siting in car waiting for someone....
B0000TB014|5.0|This is a great video and the music is great (of course).<br /><br />I bought this for my grandson and he loves it.  Great deal!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very fun game that keeps you going. Challenging, but not overwhelming. Great secondary when you're getting g tired of other popular games.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was such a great read. I was sucked in from the very start. I laughed, I cried, I snuggled my dog tight and enjoyed every page of the book. I recommend for anyone, but especially to those who love dogs.
B0071BY1PG|5.0|Great movie in 3D. Had fun watching it with my kids. Looking forward to getting more 3D movies.  I just wish a digital copy came with it like most other movies.
1594744475|5.0|I just got my book today and I love all the different recipes in it. I can't wait to try them. Now I know I can always have a fun and healthy lunch.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It keep me going could not put this book down it was captivating to say the least love John Gresham
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Does just what it is supposed to do! I didn't buy it new but it works fine. Glad I have it.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|The historic reunion concert by Led Zeppelin from 2007 is finally released. I hoped they were originally going put it out 6 months to a year after it occured. But the wait is finally over and it may be your last chance to witness as well as listen to a full Zeppelin show ever again. This performance doesn't disappoint and it shows how Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, John Paul Jones can still put on a show with the help of Jason Bonham filling in on the drum parts made famous by his Dad, the late John Bonham. What's more is hearing songs like Good Times, Bad Times(Which opened the show), Ramble On and For Your Life live for the first time ever. Classic rock can't be complete without this. A night to be remembered, especially for those who actually saw it live. Rock and roll! Always get the Led out!
B001AUEMFS|5.0|I love Coldplay!!!  Chris Martin makes me want to dance. My kids get a kick watching me when I play this tune. It's motivating.
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|Excellent app designed well ..does what it's sopose to.even sends notifications<br />This helps me identify when the moon affects my husbands mood swings. I've tracked it and it does affect people.
B005HSG3U6|1.0|The Kindle Fire microshell folio case cover by Marware looks nice, but the upright support doesn't hold up properly thus the Kindle will fall.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|My Case for the Kindle HD was very nice item for the HD.  Once I figured out how to use it.
B008Y1YKE4|4.0|This movie was fun to watch, it had a different story line than other christmas movies out there.  Would recommend for any one to watch.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Nice set with all three movies and a book with still images and concept art. Great deal to finish up the series.
B008FPZQRO|5.0|The remastering of Tarkus was masterfully done by Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson.  The &#34;Unknown Ballad&#34; is not an ELP song and does not belong on the CD.  This may make it a  collector's item some day.  The CD arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  Very smooth, easy, and fast.
B003O86FMW|5.0|There was some repetition as others said but I still felt it was good. Not quite as many turns. A little easier to do figure out the plan in this one
B007TK77QE|3.0|I really had to concentrate to get into The Casual Vacancy.  At times I felt there were too many characters.  The writing was OK but it read more like an outline for a script than a straight novel.  I am sure someone will make it into a film, but that was not what I was after.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I'm a level 50 in the game its so hard though its the best game I have 500 flu credits so makes the game easy
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a fast read but worth it definitely interesting and funny. However the ending was pretty predictable butit turns out how you would want it to.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a real fun game that I like to play all the time. Some of the time I find it hard to put it down
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good book I finished it in 2 days. Can't wait to read the next one  reminded how much I love to read
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book I would recommend this book for anyone to enjoy. Including adults who enjoy a good action packed story.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I agree with many of the reviewers here in that this book is quite magical. Ms. Morgenstern does a fabulous job with description, setting, and her sentences and phrases are a delight to read. The story premise is very interesting, and I admit I actually think about this book whenever I happen to dress in black and white!<br /><br />However, the middle (about 2/3 of the way in) felt a bit muddled for me as far as plot. So many characters were introduced long after the story was already rolling, and this made it hard to follow. I also agree with one reviewer in that some middle chapters could have been edited better. ALSO, there were a few problems with logic that sort of bothered me about the Night Circus itself, a major one being that if the Circus travels the world exclusively by train (this book is supposed to take place in the late 19th/early 20th centuries), then how do they go from Europe to Austrailia, to South America, to the United States, to Asia, etc.? A secret underground railway? A network of train tracks floating over the Pacific? I know, I know, it's a \\"magic\\" circus and all that, but this little fact strained the believability of the story's world for me.<br /><br />I'm on the fence about the ending. I liked it, it fit pretty well the rest of the book, but I was sort of hoping for a giant showdown between Celia, Marco and the two old, wicked illusionists. A magical, take-no-prisoners, duel/battle to the death. Now that would have been cool. Not very romantic, I suppose, but cool.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great read and I highly recommend it, even if it seems like some parts could have used a little more tweaking before publication.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's a good book with a twisting ending, can't wait for the next book mocking Jay . 5 star rating
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|one of the best hob I've played on my kindle fire! great graphics and storyline. recommend it to anyone who loves this type of app.
B008HK3XU4|3.0|Beautiful color! Love the purple.  Will not last long, too obvious and I am gentle with my stuff. Smart elastic band to hold cover closed.
B00846REIS|3.0|Little disappointed that it was solo similar almost identical to fifty shades of grey. I am not sure which one was written first, but for sure one is a copy of the other
B0001AVZA8|4.0|Part of a Christmas gift to my mother-in-law. Arrived on time and she loved it. Has watched it several times.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It's a \\"basic\\" premise. Shoot angry birds at smugly, snorting, egg stealing, and giggling pigs to pop them out of existence for sweet sweet revenge. So many levels, so much fun. It's a win win and you can't go wrong with this action packed and visually and auditory exciting bird flinging time waster.
B000LXHK22|5.0|We really like this film. We have viewed it with friends and wanted to have our own copy. First film where I have like Russel Crowe.
B003SI9WYG|4.0|Tim Burton does it again! I don't know why it is listed as a Christmas movie, I would think more of a Halloween movie, could be both I suppose. Awesome!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I rated this a five because I absolutely loved this book!!!!!! I can't wait to read the next one! I am so stuck in this series now!
B008RTE066|5.0|I like how this box set is put together and the idea of having the blue ray and dvd together is a fine idea. The booklet that accompanies this set is my favorite part and the movie although not of amazing quality is still the best I have seen and the all important sound quality is terrific! Hard Core Beatles fans should consider this box set and I am glad I did !!!
B009HELT3C|4.0|Worthy of the MIB name a good follow up that pieces the trilogy together.  Well worth renting especially if your a fan of the movies.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|loved this first book. readed twice already. loved the story. very enjoyable book. would highly recommened it. bought on kindle so i can read it on my ipads or phone
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Lots of good actors/actresses, decent plot, exciting at times, somewhat boring at other times. I've seen better but I've seen a lot worse
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing.<br />That's all I have to say. All I can say, honestly. My compliments to you Suzanne Collins, you amazing woman.
B008M0NDOK|4.0|I love gameloft so I didn't mind spending $40 on a controller for their games. The controller is pretty sold with a nice weight to it. It syncs immediately and gameplay is instantaneous. It comes with a Oakley like bag to keep dusts and debris out. The only thing I didn't like is that when using the dual sticks turning was slow. Maybe that could be fixed in the game? All in all I totally recommend buying this. It is spectacular. A d pad is the only complaint I've had and now with the iPad 4 out clocking the vita in every category your going to get a lot of use out of this thing as gameloft improves and introduces more titles.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I love this movie, its really fun to watch. The singing is good and I laughed out a lot of times.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|My son loves this movie. The one we have is worn out so I purchased this. Though we haven't watched it yet (don't even know if I still have a chance to or if our time has ran out), it was a good price for when my little guy wanted to watch it on a yucky day.
B009HEMW4W|5.0|Another hit! Awesome, I had to watch it twice it was so good. It was great all the way through, still laughing.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is the best Dairy of a Wimpy Kid yet! Can't wait for the next one!<br />One it is awesome. I can't believe it is already the<br />Seventh Book!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This TV series holds its own among the classic horror stories already told.  It has enough blood and guts to almost make you queasy but then it changes direction.  Just when you think the &#34;ggod guys&#34; are going to win, the writers sucker punch you with an event you never saw coming.  You eagerly look forward to the next episode.
B008H6GH8I|4.0|I generally prefer the Milla Jovovich live action flicks. but, if you like the CGI flicks, you'll probably think this one is okay. Not \\"great,\\" just okay. Seems some country or another in Europe is using Bio-Organic Weapons, as are the rebels in that country. In the end, it's a reasonably fun flick as long as you don't expect anything too deep.<br /><br />If you're looking for heavy duty zombie action, you'll probably prefer the first 3-4 Resident Evil live action movies. This one focuses more on the Bio-Organic Weapons. Toward the end of the movie, some of the BOWs, being controlled by one of the rebels become almost empathetic / heroic creatures as they're used against and get thrashed by even more powerful, nearly indestructible BOWs. I say nearly, 'cause apparently a tank shell to the face or an airstrike can take them out, but not much short of that. One wonders, where do you go from there?? Completely indestructible BOWs? There wouldn't be much of a story there...<br /><br />Kinda' mindless entertainment.<br /><br />I didn't find it particularly 'scary.' 'Cause, I mean, it's just computer animated and doesn't \\"look\\" real. So there's that uncanny valley that keeps you from completely suspending disbelief. But what CGI movie isn't that true of these days? Nobody quite goes for photo-realistic. Well, short of Avatar anyway...
B005VTS4EY|5.0|I usually dont like playing games. I have played angry birds before and loved it. This is the best game I have played after angry birds. It is just amazing and keeps you occupied. I play it whenever I get some time. Fantastic job!!
B0052BZ6X8|3.0|Really great story line, hope there is a sequel. They had some great special effects but some really slow and boring parts...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing. With reading for sure. Best book I have read in a while. I am definitely reading the next one.
0345531965|5.0|I am still reading this book but so far it is as good, or even better, than other novels by Grisham I have read.
B003FM1MNO|5.0|Motivated to watch it after seeing Hobbit in 3D. This is a well orchestrate sequel. I may consider buying it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Without saying too much...I appreciated the depth of the love between Skye and Holder.  Their story is unique.  A rare love connection:  one that was always there and will be forever.  I  enjoyed how the pieces of the story connected and how you got answers to questions that you didn't even know that you had.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It was  Awesome it  was easy for me to read . From your friend  Erica and Angel and Chris also Jorden
0375869026|5.0|&#34;Wonder&#34; should be required reading for school kids from grade 4 thru high school - and for their parents, too. I've never read a more remarkable, beautiful book.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|I promised myself at the beginning of 2012 I'd get smarter about the country's economy to I could make an informed decision when it was time to cast my vote.<br />Mr. Krugman enlightened me and I thank him for it.
B008NR8YTQ|5.0|I've been a big fan of Gary Moore for many years and have several of his works. He does a good job in Blues for Jimi.
B008OIQYTG|4.0|Great new release with a host of great artists. loved the sound.<br />Modern Jazz at it's best with some great acoustic arrangements
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This battery application is really good for keeping track of the status of your battery. It is clear and concise and doesn't seem to use much power. I use it on my phone and my tablet (both Samsung)
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|I expected a bit more in terms of dialog, acting and accuracy of firearms. Oh, and rational concept of ammunition.  But hey, it is Resident Evil. So aside from that, I enjoyed it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A great ending to a great series. Definitely recommend this series to anyone. Mind blowing. Heart wrenching. Just great. :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love this game, probably the best puzzle game out there. really good challenge and keeps me engaged the whole time. great app!
B000SEGUDE|3.0|Though there were parts of the book that I truly enjoyed, I felt that Mr Mitchell was &#34;showing off &#34; his considerable literary talents rather than really trying to engage the reader. Why do I have to submit to &#34;tricks and puzzles&#34;? I'm sorry if I'm old-fashioned but I want to feel that the author has something to say and isn't just trying to dazzle me with his writing talent.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Such a good story, shows that everyone has problems and needs help in life no matter how young or old. JK Rowling is brilliant.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is beast! I wish I could give it more than 5 stars! I love imangi studios for making this game!
B0038P59A0|3.0|The filming and acting were good in this movie, but it was more fighting and less thinking/development than I expected. I never was really captivated by the film...always felt I could walk away because I never was pulled into the story.
B00979CS50|1.0|disc 2 wont play! usually i buy used cd's but in this case I bought this one new and disc will not play on any cd player and cd 1 is erratic.
B0060D123K|5.0|Full of whit and whimsy. As much fun for adults as for children. These familiar Muppet characters are artfully woven into the story.
B0007Y08PQ|5.0|I still watch this video even after all these years. This was an okay movie as fasr as trek movies go but I still watch it.
B001ECDVKE|5.0|This company was fast and easy to work with.  Movie was in great shape.  So excited to get it. Definitely work with this company again.
B007N0REX6|3.0|I was wanting  more of the acoustic slash and to hear miles. This is same old same old and nothing new.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Well written and very poignant.  At times this book made me cry and at other times it made me laugh out loud.
B00A3AYI50|5.0|I watched him on American Idol and had him pegged as the winner almost from the beginning, I saw him on a home for the Holidays and wanted more.  Great CD!
B001SGEUNI|4.0|For my own preference, their other album \\"Strange Case\\" has faster, harder rocking tunes.<br />This album has good songs, but it seems almost slow compared to their later work.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|What a great body of work. Joe made it through the maze and shares the trip. What a heartfelt ride.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|Step up revolution always has me on my toes best music :) def watch . My daughter & I loved it.  We will def. Buy the DVD
B0000CF35F|5.0|Anybody that loves vinyl and music should own this. If any one loves AC/DC buy it. It is the last one w/ Bon Scott.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Man, it's LED ZEPPELIN!!.....if the Song Remains The Same album had sounded HALF this good....I would've PURCHASED IT!!!  Rock On!!!
B009439HEY|2.0|I am big fan since more than 20 years and I think GENESIS is one of the greatest rock band ever.<br /><br />But is enought ...
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I hate that is it is not completely free and that I have to type at least 8 more words before I can submit this review
B007DIQAXI|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my lady. It is probably her second favorite gift next to the engagement ring I gave her.
0894803123|5.0|This product was purchased as a gift off a wish list.  The giftee was very very happy to receive it.
B0053O89U6|3.0|For me the best season was the fisrts one.<br /><br />They still be very funy ...I hope the next seasons will be better
0399157565|5.0|Patricia Cornwell wrote an intense novel about the ways to solve crimes using forensics.  It kept you glued to the book until the crime was solved.  She deserves five stars.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is the best boo in I've ever read!:) I think everyone should like them there like the\\"New\\" Harry Potter!
0811879542|5.0|Press Here rocks for it's simplicity and interaction. Nope, no stuffed animal in the corner talks to you, there are no further illustrations but dots and no batteries are required but this simple concept of a book had my kids counting, pushing, shaking, turning and giggling with every turn of the page. They would push a spot and flip the page and see the dots transform like magic. This book has been added to our 'great gifts to give' list.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This made the whole process much easier.  I had put publishing on Kindle on the backshelf due to formatting until I found this book.  Very helpful tutorial.  My book was text only, no pics.<br /><br />Thanks!
B0063IH60K|5.0|The game is very responsive and challenging at times.  The hint feature provides a teachable moment in order to become more proficient.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I don't not recommend  this book for kids or teens but I loved this book! It tells what true love is and how far someone will go to get there
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book is amazing! After reading it I am applying the steps to my own life and slowly changing my unwanted habits.
B004IFD9HE|4.0|Very cute movie with a great story.  Lots of laughs.<br />A few things didn't need to be in there (like calling all of the girls &#34;hot&#34;), but no too bad.<br />Adam Sandler in a family movie.  Good stuff.
B001TM14VC|5.0|One of the greatest movies Tom Cruise has done. Couldn't help turn inning up the surround sound for that full effect of the jets. Always a great movie that I can watch over and over.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book is truly one of the best! Touching and then funny goal of the right places. An amazing read.. worded so beautifully. It is one of those books that will give you a different perspective on life.
0547564651|4.0|I think the book is a little revolutionary. It shines a new light at things. Changes our thinking from the old 'reliable' into better... Amazing! Really worth reading.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Imaginative and articulate. I couldn't put it down. Highly Recommend to anyone that appreciates a story that brings the unreal to reality.
B000062V9C|4.0|Daughter loved the movie. Recommend this to any toddler. Movie will keep them intertwined for the whole movie. Loved it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Greatest masterpiece I´ve read in a long, long time. A book about survival, not that Twilight nonsense now fading away.
B0076UXKDG|3.0|This is a good quality accessory for the Nikon D800 camera.  it works like it should.  The battery grip for the Nikon D700 and D200 that I have were about 50% less cost, But same build quality and same function.  I just did not want to take the risk of buying lesser grip for my $2900.00 Nikon Camera.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This was a fun and easy read. I chuckled all the way from Dallas to Austin and it made I35 almost bearable. No, I was not driving.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Good graphics, great variety of task abilities, liked the cutting and coloring the best! Granddaughter has played with it many sessions since receiving it. Thanks!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book takes you into a whole new perspective in life and shows you that life does get bumpy at times and it helps you learn about life at a whole different angle.<br /><br />I would defiantly recommend this book to all readers out there. It is truly a work of art.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|somewhat challenging & fun. It is great to play when waiting for appointments. Very satisfied with quality and entertaining. Very addicting.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I Received Secret of the Wings timely and in excellent condition.  My grand children were absolutely thrilled, with a beautiful picture.
0316023744|5.0|Because he is such a good story teller, and makes history come alive. I have just started it, and am looking forward to going on with it.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This has been a really good book. I read the whole thing in like four days. I definitely recommend it
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Since I must log expenses per budget category, this app makes applying the tax per expense easy. I love that it shows a portion of the math that has been done. Tres bon!
B008OTTSX4|5.0|Very nice tribute to one of rocks finest! Chickenfoot does an outstanding cover of Highway Star. Iron Maiden's version of Space Truckin' really rocks out.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Its fascinating and not easy in some of the tasks.  But worth trying!!  Some of the items were very easy and others almost impossible.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|The book is very good and has info in it lots of it. my brothers like it two. it helps them on home work and on essays
B009ESIGHI|5.0|I'm a muppet fan. Frankly, I can't wait until Disney releases the original Muppet Movie and The Great Muppet Caper on Blu Ray. Meanwhile, I'll settle for this classic retelling of the Charles Dickens Christmas masterpiece. If your kids have never been exposed to the muppets, this is a good way to do it. All the gang are here, and the 20th Anniversary Edition is simply amazing. But, then again, the muppets were, and are, amazing, innovative, and funny.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Preordered it for their price and got it on time. Price match applied on this product and a couple of days after got an email  and a few dollars off.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Although I usually listen to country music, I was mesmerized by Susan Boyle's voice on this fabulous CD. I love to listen to Susan's melodic voice to destress after a busy day, and her renditions of my favorite broadway tunes were NOT disappointing.It is definitely a must have for Broadway fans and Donny Osmond fans.I also bought a copy of this CD for a friend that is a huge Donny Osmond fan, and she was thrilled. I give this CD five stars!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was one of those books that you don't want to put down. I can't wait to see the movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I first started reading this book I tried to predict the ending or why the characters were acting the way they do, but I never expected this. I love when a book throws me a twist where I have to look up from the page and just gasp with awe. Great book. I would recommend this book yo mature audiences though. Very detailed.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can't even begin to tell you how much I loved this book and the writer of this story was a genius putting it down on paper. Sometimes you read a story and wonder how on earth the writer (C. Hoover) came up with this story and intertwined all the details to make this such an amazing book that you feel like this is so real...There isn't anything else that I could say that someone else hasn't said in the reviews already but I am telling you that you must read this book.... I pinky promise that you will love it too. Just as beautiful as the stars in the sky.
B0038P59A0|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie!  Lots of twist, turns, and action. The actors work well together and it shows in the pacing of the humor. I would rate this as a must see.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|vulgar - language was just rude, not funny. Too bad, had potential. Won't recommend this movie to anyone. Definitely not for kids or young adults.
B006Z21ZEW|5.0|I've been saying for over 30 years now that no band on earth gives you more bang for your buck than Iron Maiden - this DVD proves this claim still true! The video is well shot and crystal clear! The sound quality is also top notch, especially considering this is a live show of one of (if not THE) loudest bands in the world playing to a stadium sized audience! As to the band themselves, they haven't lost a step over their long careers, neither has Eddie - no matter what happened to him over the years. Maiden is still pin-point accurate in their playing and enthusiastic in their performances! How they can maintain this kind of energy after all these years is beyond me! Then again, no band is going to make a concert DVD from an off night - LOL! If you enjoy Iron Maiden's music, or just progressive hard rock in general, buy/rent/borrow or steal this DVD - you won't be disappointed in the least. Just make sure you have the energy to keep up for two hours of rock and roll perfection!
B00138CXFS|5.0|I was looking for a recording of Embryonic Journey, and found this whole MP3 album at Amazon. I'm enjoying it, and I'm not sophistocated enough to rebut any of the other reviews. If you liked Surealistic Pillow when it was new, you'll still like the MP3.
B001P9KR94|5.0|such a great storyline. bought this as a stocking stuffer. it was cheaper than in store so i had to snag it.
B009JBZH54|4.0|This was an excellent trilogy and I enjoyed adding it to my DVD collection.  The Blu Ray has a number of fun extras that provide some interesting background to the films.
B0050JN88M|3.0|This concert video is from the Tommy Bolin era of Deep Purple, which was a much less aggressive version of the band once the pressure of playing with the super uptight Ritchie Blackmore was relieved. Unfortunately at this point, Tommy's drug addictions had started compromising his otherwise excellent guitar playing. The pressure of trying to play Blackmore's parts was apparent on the more classic Purple, but Tommy otherwise was much more competent playing material from Come Taste The Band which was obviously his own jazz inspired style. Unfortunately the concert footage is only just under an hour, but it's just as well for the reasons listed above.<br /><br />As far as the extra features, if you enjoy watching obviously stoned, aging rockers (primarily Glenn Hughs, to a lesser extent the late Jon Lord) reminiscing about their drug-laden past exploits (it's normal to snort coke off a hooker's butt, right Glenn?), then you are in for a treat! Glory days... Otherwise, just watch the actual show and save yourself two hours of constant repetition (sometimes repeated with alternate footage, but constatntly repeated) that you'll NEVER get back!
B0020NH94A|5.0|Jill Taylor really takes you along on her journey through having a stroke and being aware of it, and her road to recovery. She debunks the most popular &#34;knowledge&#34; about what stroke recoverers need (they need rest!). Jill's mother is one of the true heroines of this story: she moved in with Jill and gave her the one-on-one, 24/7 attention that she needed to recover.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|just like all the other complaints the facebook app for the kindle stinks butt. it only loads the first few items for the news feed and the rest are just text and it doesn't keep loading after that to see more. I was surprised how far behind and the lack of options it had for the kindle. can't wait for it to be up to par with the app for my android phone
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I enjoyed descriptive details the Dr was able to write about it read ----it makes you a believer----Heaven is for real!!! Lub
0553381407|5.0|I ordered it for my daughter.She had been looking for but, with no success.She had read a copy of her doctor but want her own copy it was in new condition and was very helpful to her.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie made me laugh louder than I have in a very long time - although it did seem like a bit of a Glee spin-off. If you don't mind that though, then it's great! Totally worth watching.
B00866JL96|4.0|I love most nicholas sparks movies and this one isn't any different. i got it at a bargain price black friday weekend and zac efron in the movie doesn't hurt :p
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|This movie shows off the brilliance that is Seth MacFarlane. I highly suggest it to anyone that loves to laugh.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Movie was well done and very endearing well worth watching.  It touched a place in my heart.  A real lesson in aging.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved it!  I could not put it down until I finished it.  It ended with an unexpected twist.  Great book.
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|i absolutely LOVE this movie. it's soooo hilarious and having channing tatum in it doesn't hurt. bought the blu ray as a stocking stuffer and it came quickly.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|I can't find a flaw with the game.  It's fun, it's fair, and it has reasonable achievements.  The Google play version has more frequent updates though which feels a bit unfair.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I loved Something Borrowed and this was a great book to follow up with it. I have also read Baby Proof and enjoyed that one as well.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|The graphics are awesome, but the laser bird is insane. Now, when you just got the laser bird, it's nothing. But, TWO MONTHS LATER!!!!! When I tap to the left, will it go to the left? NO!!!!!!!! If you have a tablet, don't get it. On the Kindle Fire, it's bad too. Four words : DON'T GET THE APP. The other birds are great. But, the laser bird needs to be removed. Rovio has screwed up majorly.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|this app for my kindle works just as great as the app for my phone. I can do all the functions i do on my laptop
B008476HBM|5.0|I have read this book many times and never get tired of it.  It's my all time favourite.  The characters come to life.  This is realisistic of the period.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was an amazing book I couldn't put it down!!! I can't wait to read the third book I just love it!!!
B00447L4KA|5.0|It's such a great story and the acting is perfection! So happy I now have this on DVD to watch again and again.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|This movie is such a classic so when I saw it for super cheap on black friday I had to buy it to add to the collection. This DVD was just as great as watching it the first time around
B000AGTPUU|3.0|GOOD MOVIE LOVE WATCHING IT AT CHRISTMAS AND ANYOTHER TIME , MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE A KID AGAIN HAS GREAT VISUAL
B002UNMW7O|5.0|The Boondock Saints II is a good follow up to the first movie, even if it was ten years later.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|I have seen few movies that will measure the great expanse that this movie took me to.  This was a great love story.  It starts out like many great books; introducing you to all of the characters, and giving a back story.  Followed by a brilliant combination of them to create this movie.  Overall, this is a heart-felt story which takes you through the stages of heart-break, comedy and ends on a subtle note of content.
B009MF56GC|4.0|I would have given this movie five stars but the cursing for the sake of cursing is the same problem as in the first movie. I have to wonder if they put it in just to get the R rating. The rest of the movie is great actors playing the parts they where born to play, action adventure, bullets flying, explosions with some vehicle chasing eye candy we love to watch. If you can take the cursing this needs to be in your collection, if not, give this movie a pass.
6305428042|5.0|the quality of the movie was great and it came right before my Halloween party. The movie was in original packaging and played perfectly.
B000PMG16U|5.0|I bought this as a xmas gift for my husband. We are both big Star Wars fans. We spent xmas day night having a marathon and watched all 3 films. The quality is fantastic and of course the films are great. Also a great price for the trilogy on Blu-ray.
B008ZVXNX2|5.0|Love this cd, it has aol many songs that I've wanted for a long time now, it plays great, and it is a great price for all the classics that you get
0307346617|5.0|another great story from the son of Mel Brooks also the author of The Zombie Survival Guide, which is also awsome.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|This was the CUTEST!!!! baby and stroller to give my 15 month old grand-daughter!!! Just the right proportions for a little girl and the baby looks like a REAL baby.........LOVE IT!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|My kids love this game! It is perfect for keeping them entertained. Kids of all ages will enjoy playing this game!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|The topic is timely and could very well happen. The plot was excellent and kept you at the edge of your set And a page turner. If you like thrillers this book is for you
B0093FNZT6|5.0|I found this book to be honest and informative. Once you start reading you can't put it down and it is easy to read, as many books about this subject can be confusing and misleading. I recommend it to everyone.
1619695006|4.0|Rowling continues to deliver in a new genre. She paints a beautiful picture of every character.  Listening to this provided the feel of the real characters with the accent, tone  and slang that one misses when reading.  I found this book compelling and heartbreaking.
B005OHSD3A|5.0|I wish Dr. Atkins had lived to see the wonderful outcome of so many years-long studies done on his diet that proved him right. He was vilified for many years by diet and nutrition &#34;experts&#34;, but has been completely vindicated in recent years.His is the ONLY eating plan that I have both loved and been able to stay on, for the most part for years. I got this new book just at the right time - just as the Christmas season was beginning, and I am very much looking forward to the greater variety of foods I can eat now on Atkins, and the new ideas that will make it easier to stay on the eating plan forever. For years it has benefited me, my son, friends, and recently my husband, who is  a Type II diabetic. He refused to go on Atkins for years, but finally agreed to try it. He has lost all the weight he wanted to and now is able to dispense with most of his diabetic medication. I am so happy for him, and now things will be even easier for all of us Atkins devotees!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This is such an awesome soundtrack to an awesome movie. I cry, basically, every time I listen to it because I remember the scenes from the movie. Anne Hathaway's performance is stunning. Timeless music.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I always love reading about Harry.  Can't put it down.<br />It's a quick read.  Maybe some more beef next time.
B009CG29RK|4.0|Great movie..my kids have watched this movie over and over again..I definitely would recommend it to anyone who wants a laugh! :)
B0061Q13V2|4.0|I thought this book was an eye-opening read about the incredible pressures on Olympic athletes, particularly with trainers who lack basic humanity and are completely single-minded about &#34;going for the gold&#34;. It was a very sad account of a child's never feeling good enough and of parental and trainer abuse of a severe mental variety; but the wonderful story of family regained is tremendously inspiring and remarkable. I enjoyed the outcome so much and the &#34;balance&#34; that was being gained in Dominique's life.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book is fun to read as long as you don't expect too much. Just read, have fun, and enjoy!
B0064SVOTS|5.0|Great album and I love the sound of vinyl. Robert Glasper is genius and this is just one of those albums you can keep playing.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game is awesome for all animal lovers like me it is fun seeing  all of those animals and getting to know all the new ones and combining different types of animals to see what they make then looking at what they created it is totally awesome and very cool
B0063IH60K|5.0|This solitaire game is really fun. Alot of phone games you have to play against others. This one is nice because you can play by yourself or choose toplay with others.
B008IJT0CE|2.0|I have the free version and I am tempted to get the full but it seems to be too much money. I have a kindle fire and I read about the skipping problem. Only two stars for the price
0316069434|5.0|Quick and easy read. One of my favorite authors. We all have a black box in us. completely recommend this to everyone.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|There is not one day in which something happens in the news or in life that doesn't make me think of Cloud Atlas. The most intelligent novel, the most incredible writer who can take you on an unforgettable voyage through times past and future and yet keep you grounded in sameness!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great story but I did not like the ending. Kept me up all night, great suspense, however the ending is a bit incredible.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Half the posts don't show up and only a limited number ever come through.  I'm going back to using the internet for my FB rather then this app.
B002U3CCBK|5.0|The use of diary entries and other correspondence moves the story along at a good pace. The main character is likeable and gains sympathy due to his not-so-likeable wife.
B0060AY6FO|1.0|One of the most boring novels! The writer did nothing but repeat the events of Pride and Prejudice and when she went into the new story, the plot was sadly pathetic.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|you can play games and create a whole village of ice age characters.you can go to other villages and make friends.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you liked the &#34;Shades of Grey&#34; books, you should enjoy these also!<br />I hate waiting for #3 to come out!!!!  LOL
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love traditional solitaire and this game is great...it has different ways to play, and you can also enjoy the challenges of just playing a great game..thanks for making solitaire on the go the best!
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Interesting plot and twists. In the end an unusual love story. I am still very much in love with his novel Saturday!
B008HK3XOU|5.0|great case but i mistakenly purchased this one i only have the kindle fire not the hd but the quality is great
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Along the same lines as &#34;Shades of Grey&#34; books. I hate waiting for #3 to come out!!!!  May can't get here soon enough.
B005DOL0R0|4.0|Like it a lot. Was very pleased with it. Easy to use - convenient to open and close. Very happy.
B005BDZQKU|5.0|Its West Side Story! This collectors set is a great buy, firstly as we as a whole seem to be interested in musicals again as a film going public (Les Miserables, Phantom of the Opera etc...) but because its a handsome collectors set priced right, perfect for any home collection. The film itself on Blu-ray looks just like I remember it from the womb in 61' Thanks again Mom for taking me!<br /><br />Trivia fact about West Side Story: Richard Beymer aka Tony went on to be in The Longest Day with Natalie Wood's husband Robert Wagner.... (and about 80% of every name in Hollywood)
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love to read books and Kindle makes it easy to do.  Works on all of my android devices. Easy to use.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Mockingjay moves at a different pace than the previous two books, suddenly changing locations, without a timeline to follow.  Good action sequences to read through. You can feel the cruelty of the capitol in some places.  All in all a good read, hard to put down.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love it!! It's a total step up from the old one which I had on my iPod. It has great new features and better quality. I'm very impressed!! GET THIS APP!!
B008Z9L94O|5.0|I was extremely reluctant to purchase the vinyl boxed set due to the quality control issues that have been reported by other purchasers.  It is a lot of money to spend on the frustration and disappointment of returning an album as heavy as this.  In fact, I decided that I wouldn't buy this album until I was at my local record shop, Freecloud Records, and held in my hands - this is a very heavy, beautifully conceived set in the original track order (unlike the original triple vinyl version with alternative sequencing).  Sadly, the two bonus tracks from the original vinyl edition are missing, but I digress...<br /><br />The sound on my copy is very good - it isn't perfect or pristine, but very true to the original sound (i.e. there IS distortion but to the intent of artist).  The only track that didn't sound very balanced was \\"Thru The Eyes of Ruby\\" - otherwise, I was very pleased with the set.  Perhaps my expectations were so low from the unfortunate pressings received by Amazon, but everything, from packaging, printing quality, vinyl weight & condition, and attention to detail (each album is housed in its own lined inner sleeve as well as a second cardboard sleeve both inside a third high quality cardboard sleeve) was perfect!  Billy Corgan outdid himself this time with this re-issue - it is truly a vinyl fetishist's dream!!<br /><br />The music is, of course, unbelievable - the band set out to create \\"The Wall\\" for the 1990's and created their \\"White Album\\" instead.  A lot of the \\"alternative music\\" from the 90's was aggressive and relentlessly harsh - the diversity of sounds and melodies presented here were a welcome relief!  The band sends the listener on a journey that lasts over two and a half hours - it may not all be great, but it IS ambitious and VERY satisfying!<br /><br />If you like the Pumpkins and this album, I urge you to take a chance on purchasing a copy on vinyl - it is truly a work of art - the problems that I have read on the Amazon site have moreto do with poor quality control, which is common of many Capitol albums (remember The Dark Side of the Moon?) than a cash grab.  The attention to detail here is astounding!
B005YDLJ76|5.0|I am a HUGE Beyonce fan.  This DVD does not disappoint.  Throughout the performances she shares several personal videos, pictures, and otherwise unseen footage.  Her performances are spot on and the picture and filming of the concert is great.  Beyonce fan or not I would suggest this DVD to anyone!
B007SGM084|5.0|This was  Great read. The perfectly, yet, entertaining love story ever. Would love  to hear more the writer. There should be another book added to this story. This story will also greatly influence anyone's sex life.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's a really great app and works awesome on Kindle Fire HD. The best part is that when you save a picture from it to Fire HD it makes its own file which helps a lot with organizations. Pinterest is a great way to share ideas and recipes. I would totally get Pinterest!
B005LAIGIM|4.0|it was an movie i did not fall asleep .<br />if you like eddie you will like it<br />i give it 4 out of 5
1449415881|5.0|Hello<br />Bought this for my son for Christmas and he loved it!  I buy him one every year and he thinks it great.  And also the delievery was very qucikly!!  Thanks....
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Excellent narration! Love the clarity and quality of the voice. The stories are read at the perfect pace with wonderful emphasis !
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun time waster. Always want more coins. Kids enjoy playing with me too. Can't wait to get to higher levels.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|I was expecting more of comedy from the previews, perhaps along the line of &#34;Somethings Gotta Give&#34;, with Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton.  Especially that this movie had Steve Carell in it, The story line was not bad in itself, but it was more serious, about an aging couple with relationship issues.  It was more of a Lifetime show, not something I would pay to go see or rent (like I did).  There were a couple of parts in it I didn't need to see.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|love jack ryan  series  like  family  read  first  with  Hunt  Red  October  followed  suspense  thru  family history.  Clancey  makes  you  crazy  waiting  for  shoe  to  drop<br /><br />THREAT  VECTOR
0897502027|5.0|It is important to note when you are reading this book that it is a gathering of a collection of notes that Bruce wrote throughout his career that were organized together into a more presentable fashion. But I still feel it is invaluable.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have fun with this game!  Thanks for letting me share this information with the world!  You'll enjoy this game.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|The book was entertaining, but as far as military spec ops books go it was just okay.  The book writing was average and never really grabbed/ hooked me like many others have.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, i loved the humor and the romance between Megan and Connor.  l look forward to reading more of Mira's books!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|The movie is pretty well done, if you like Bourne movies this is on par with the first Damon movies.
0736092269|5.0|Shows every muscle there is, a lot u never heard of, and all the muscles used in each exercise.  Also shows correct position, stretching, and medical pointers. Ive seen a lot of books but this is the one to have. I could get rid of my collection n just have this one.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Realistic story, great characters, read it!<br />Waking up married,and dealing with the morning after and past baggage. Will it work?
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Fast pace and keeps you laughing through out. A true comedy. Even makes you want to start singing! A must watch.
B007Q0OUNA|3.0|It is your typical overpriced Lego set. I think they are a great toy for kids, can keep them busy for awhile, and it helps with physical and mental dexterity. What makes me rate it low is the price. I believe this toy is probably made for Lego for pennies, but at $50.00, it is not a good value.
1449410243|5.0|Very funny. Perfect gift for the owners of a mischievous cat. Format of book is comic book style with some pull outs and a poster.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|How exciting for this franchise to finally have some life! I thoroughly enjoyed this film from beginning to end! Great!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Our friends got us hooked on the show so we had to buy the 1st season.<br />Very interesting and entertaining.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Having gone through Florida hurricanes and the crazy weather of the Virginia mountains we believe that being forewarned is being forearmed.  This is our chosen source of reliable information.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|worth every penny. My son has even taken it from me. Can't wait to get it back from him. Excellent
145210655X|5.0|Great book. it has a lot of images, and it is long so i can spend a long time reading and actually speaking about the images. I loved the price and how fast it shipped and arrived.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Just started watching the 4th season.<br />So crazy the things they have to go through.<br />Very interesting story line. :)
B0000266T2|5.0|Some things just don't lose their quality over time.  The music made by these two men fits that category.  Harmony, message, range, they had/have it all.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I finished this book in three days! Not an easy feat considering that I am a mother of two toddlers. I just couldn't put it down. I felt so captivated by each of the characters and longed for the circus again and again as I was reluctant to even stop reading for a moment. It pulls you in, weaves its magic, and you can't help but be on the edge of your seat in awe and wonder. Come and see for yourself what lies beyond the field, where black and white tents appear, open at night and close at dawn.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it was awe-some I can not stop playing it. my friend told me about it. it was super awesome. epic 5 stars for minecraft pe
B001RTSPVY|5.0|After finishing the 1st season, we had to have the 2nd!!<br />I like that we can watch a little a day or watch it all! lol
B005KMX866|5.0|I received this item for Christmas this year and I find it to be spectacular.  Mr. Isaak is in excellent form on all of the songs but I absolutely LOVE Doin' The Best I Can (3rd song on the second CD).  I believe he performs this even better than Mr. Presley did originally.  It is certainly worth getting if you like this type of music and even more so if you are a Chris Isaak fan.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book was very very interesting and action packed, I have read many books but this one has just caught my eye and I can wait to read number 2!!!!!!
B0009XRZ9M|5.0|I took the kids on a Polar Express train ride just before Christmas and they loved it. Prior to the train ride, we had only read the book and watched the movie once. Since they liked the ride so much, I bought the movie. My 3 and 9 year old watched it over and over. All of their friends have watched it at our house too. You can't go wrong with such a great holiday movie.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It's a helpful and resourceful book to have in your library it's definitely got all the word I need and more
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Riveting from the first page, the action continues all the way to the end and still leaves a cliffhanger. I hope there is a sequel!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow Free is an app I knew nothing about when I downloaded it. It is a simplistic but outstanding puzzle game and should be ranked among the best apps out there
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I bough this as a Christmas gift for a Star Wars fan. This set is pretty nice and you get them all on blu-ray. Amazon is the only place I found this set. You can't go wrong with these!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love how the book is written and it leaves me in suspense throughout the entire book.<br />I can't wait for the second book!!!!!!
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Very good book. It's very good for kids. It is long but very good. I recommend it. Again, awesome book.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book is a great read for all ages but for young adults especially. It truly is a peculiar read
B00112ASXK|5.0|My daughter collects and plays with all of the Schleich horses. This tinker stallion is very nice. It is made is very durable and forgiving rubber and painted very nice. You can't go wrong with Schleich brand.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It is by far my new favorite book. I'm probably going to start it again right away. Seriously worth the time.
B0076DELIG|5.0|another great Harry Bosch story. what's not to like, Harrys to young to retire. Keep him on the job. The Black Box was great
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|What an incredible story of pain, love, beauty, and hope. Absolutely phenomenal. If you are looking for a good read that you can't put down, this is a great choice.
B001P8B8R0|5.0|This is a beautiful horse with lots of detail. Schleich toys are great for kids of all ages. They do well indoors or out and can easily fit into a backpack for travel.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This is a wonderful book with adventure ,suspension and a twist around every corner. In this book Percy Jackson is back to fight with the risen Titan Lord Kronos . Typhon is risen and headed to Olympus. The gods give Percy a wish and secrets from Luke and Annabeth`s past are revealed. Is this the end of the gods?
B009GFEOY8|3.0|A little pricey and takes too many pictures to get the color right so you feel like your wasting film.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I'd heard a lot about Downton Abbey so I took a chance and purchased the DVDs.  Excellent, excellent, excellent.  Very engrossing.  You can't stop watching and hoping that everything will come out well for all the characters.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|The only flaw that i saw with this calcualtor is that it does not have the option to use the square root ssymbol. But other than this it os great. if you are doing a multi question it adds it together as you go.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I don't see why this doesn't have more recognition! Great graphic quality, the missions are great, the only thing that is a little annoying is how expensive the items get. It's got a multiplayer mode, I don't see anything that could make it better!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|All of my kids enjoy this movie every Christmas! It has an excellent story, great music, and fun for the whole family!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Engaging game. A good time waster when you don't want to think too hard. Good graphics, better than most mat h 3 games.
B004132HZS|5.0|My family and I truly love mysteries and were thrilled when we came across this one.The British are great for their mystery series .I wish they would come out with a third season.They have acquired a large following.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I chose to read this book because I have read all of Rick Riordan's other books. I really enjoyed all of the Percy and Annabeth moments. Also, I won't give it away... the Climax was very good. I now am greatly anticipating the next book in the series: The House of Hades. I would recommend reading this book if you enjoy Greek and/or Roman mythology. And if you have read any other books by Rick Riordan because they ALL are great. If you enjoyed this book, please read The Kane Chronicles if you haven't already
B0058VW36U|5.0|This app was awesome . It rarely  glitches and runs fine it took a little long to download but it was great
B007EECSFA|5.0|A great story written by Kate Morton. Couldn't put it down.  A love story, a mystery and a all around interesting story
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I think that when you go to Go-To you should be able to type in the word and maybe put actual page numbers!!!!!!!!!!!!:)
B008476HBM|5.0|Never being a fan of the classics, I was delightfully shocked at how much I enjoyed this book. Jane Austen has converted me and I now find myself in possession of all of her wonderful books now. What I thought would be a dreadful endurance has turned into a new favorite of mine and opened my eyes to the wonders that this amazing author has to offer. This is a great book for everyone willing to read it!
B008M721MS|4.0|so good. I love it. I can see your mom in the window. what is her name. she is FABULOUS
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I chose the book to read before i went to the movie, and truly did not know anything other than what i saw on the movie trailers.  The writing is beautiful, rich and exotic.  This is not a light read, but more than worthwhile.
0316228532|5.0|This book was excellent and I really didn't want to put it down.  We picked this for our book club choice and we will be having our next meeting soon.  J.K. Rowling is a wonderful author!
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|at the part where you're in the managers office and the cabinet is locked, it says locked and you need a puzzle piece thats in there in order to move on. i thought buying the full version would unlocked it but it still says that. please help if its fixable!!!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|To long to read and was very confusing. Would not recommend it to any one.  Should have made it shorter
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Cute movie especially if you enjoy music. Nothing particularly challenging but just enjoyable. Good characters that we've seen before but still a good movie.
B000FCK65W|4.0|I enjoyed this book, it opened my eyes on how hard the Times were back then. Francis was a strong person.
B000W198FA|3.0|Jimmy do you remember when you wanted Terry Reid to be the lead singer for Led Zeppelin? Do you think he is still capable of doing an album with you. If so I would love to hear it, Fans of Jimmy should listen to some of Terry Reid's albums.
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|I love this book because it showed love and how to love a person it like a lesson thank you
B00APUQRPC|5.0|There is so much great about this story. The on its face story is engaging, but the story of a daughter coming to terms with choices is real and compelling. Great cast of characters. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
B003YL4KS0|3.0|it was okay because I had it on e reader and I couldn't see the videos:( overall good book though
0547995660|5.0|The Giver is one of my all time favorite books!  As a former teacher, I had a class set that kept us all turning the pages and wondering if this utopian world was really as perfect as it seemed.  I can't help sharing it with everyone who hasn't read it yet.  Lois Lowry has yet to disappoint me with anything she has written.  Her latest release, Son, is the fourth book in the Giver Quartet and ranks right up their with The Giver.  It answers many of the questions lingering after finishing The Giver!
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this game is awesome.Best game I probly ever played.I think people are gonna love it.People better like it its challeing Lol apes chasing a person :D. bai
B005EHQGTS|1.0|After finally getting signed in after several hours and troubleshooting because of password issues and having to uninstall and reinstall the streaming on my pc I finally got to use it for all of 10 minutes.<br /><br />I tested it and tried to get out of program and it would not let me, it froze on my kindle, finally got disconnected and monitor would not return on my desktop pc, kept saying no connection.<br /><br />Turned pc off and restarted, same problem.  Turned pc off and unplugged and restarted - wow fun Bonus - had to completely restore system.<br /><br />Tried calling splashtop but you can only email support, so I had done that and waited while my pc was restoring, but still no instant reply, finally 1 hour later and I am now reloading everything on my pc.  Thank goodness for the cloud and my passport or I would be completely hosed.<br /><br />It appears that this works for many people, but after this experience I wont risk it again.  Very frustrated because I had really wanted this app.  The other lesson was always try free version first at least if it is awful you did not pay for the hours of anxiety a bad app can cause.<br /><br />Windows 7 64 bit desktop pc<br />Kindle Fire HD<br /><br />Bad combo!
B004J4XGN6|5.0|It's basically very hard to criticize the concepts written in this book. Some comments highligths the author as &#34;self absorbed&#34; - I just can not see this book that way. Eric gives lot of examples how he learned hard way things which are not only interesting but very good examples.<br /><br />However, if you are already aware of the concept, this book may not give much new to you.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|Smooth, creamy, and luscious, though with some very sour notes! Oh crumb cake! Now I must scramble and taste the next course of course! Oh that I had not the fortunate misfortune of devouring this delicacy in a sitting! I fear this feast may be too rich and glorious for my taste! Yet my appetite is whet for what follows. Is Lemony your real name?
B0087JTAKW|5.0|The Timekeeper is incomparable to any story I have ever read. A must read for sure, whether  you are a Mitch Album fan or not.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Really enjoyed this game! Fun and challenging!  Would highly recommend! My favorite game from Big Fish so far. Definitely worth the money.
1449410243|5.0|The book is a blast to read, even if you don't own a cat. If you do own a cat, you'll laugh yourself silly!
B002PEP4SC|5.0|We watch the series so I wanted to read the book, I'm very happy I've read it.  Will continue reading the series
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|The game is sweet but when it asks you to rate it just rate it other wise it will ask you to rate it every 5 minutes but other than that it's totally worth it
1451695195|2.0|As a biochemist, I am always looking for evidence that disproves my present negative views on spirituality and the supernatural. This book falls far short of its promising title. Here are some counterarguments:<br /><br />1. He claims that his cortex was not functioning during his coma, due to destruction by bacteria. Yet he awakes from the coma saying \\"Thank you\\", which obviously requires a well-functioning cortex.<br /><br />2. His reason for believing that his cortex was dead (non-functioning) is based on other cases of bacterial meningitis. But allegedly his case was unique, 1 in 10 million, so what cases can he possibly compare?<br /><br />3. His near-complete recovery of memory and mental functions very soon after awakening indicates that his cortex was not dead.<br /><br />4. Brain trauma is very likely to cause hallucinations. Dreams often occur in compressed or expanded time. Perhaps his time sense was distorted during coma and all of his supernatural sensations occurred during a short period before arousal.<br /><br />5. He speaks of longings for spiritual foundations and for contact with his birth family. These feelings might affect his dreams and later recollections. Human memory is notoriously suggestible.<br /><br />6. Chapter 33, The Enigma of Consciousness, is full of pseudo-scientific ideas including claims about ESP, psycho-kinesis, clairvoyance, telepathy, and precognition (p.153), all of which have been thoroughly and repeatedly debunked by skeptical scientists. Action at a distance, universal connectedness, and implications of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle are widely misunderstood by laymen and some scientists.<br /><br />7. Although the author's credentials as a neurosurgeon seem to be impeccable, his interpretations of his dreams and emotions are not based on science and are not scientifically acceptable as proof of anything except, perhaps, that the brain can resist and recover from severe bacterial meningitis.<br /><br />My overall conclusion is that this book was disappointing because it cloaks its emotional conclusions in pseudo-scientific misinterpretations. I continue to think that our physical brains are fully capable of human thought and emotions, without involvement of any supernatural influences.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|More confusing and not as much content as the first book. But over all a good read. Hope the third one is better.
B00170MYIS|5.0|Tried a third party battery.  It didn't work well.  This battery holds the charge and works in two kinds of chargers.
B00A757EFW|2.0|Thought it would be a fun &#34;revival&#34; of a favorite of years ago. However, it's difficult to maneuver on a pad, so it was more frustrating than fun...
B00AA7O22U|2.0|Too much blood splattering for my taste. Only made it through the first 18 minutes. Like several of the cast members.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is the best game ever I am totally addicted to it. It is a great game to play it's so entertainig I cannot stop playing it. love it
B008458O3S|5.0|I purchased this app to exercise my brain and it does!  I am stuck at the moment on one puzzle but too determined not to finish.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|Rented the movie via Prime and wish I had the money back.  While humorous in parts the movie as a whole isn't suffering through to get to the funny.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I am a person who does not generally like musicals. Les Miserables, based on the Victor Hugo book, broke that rule for me. I loved the play, adored the movie, and the soundtrack brought the movie back. The actors actually sang as they were acting, and the track was not &#34;dubbed&#34; later. This technique brought feeling to the music like I have not experienced in a movie. Ann Hathaway, while singing the terribly sad&#34;I Dreamed a Dream&#34;, was doing what I call the &#34;ugly cry&#34; and you can hear the tears in her voice and the sniffle in her nose even. Best to bring tissues in your car...I cried like a baby all the way home from work.  This is truly great music...you will carry it in your heart.
0525953728|3.0|Mark Owen was very likely a much better navy seal than he is an author, even assisted by a ghost writer.  He actually managed to make an very interesting topic a bit plodding.  Even the big finish, the assault on the Bin Ladin compound, left me under whelmed.  I expected a book that I couldn't put down, but what I got was a book that I had to force myself to finish, in the unmet hope that there would be a payoff at the end.  I really wanted this book to be good - I just can't say that it met my expectations.
0316066524|5.0|...it would take more space than I have available to talk about this book, which is already one of the most talked-about books of the last century. If you love books and love clever authors, this is a wonderful if challenging book. If you are looking for a quick or escapist read, move on.
B003A9WLCS|3.0|I bought this for my wife who is a Sade fan.  I too am a fan.  Upon the first play of this CD I'm disappointed.  Maybe I need to listen to it some more and it will grow on me.  To get me wrong, it isn't bad at all, just not what I was hoping for.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Very happy with MoboPlayer on my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;.  It has played everything I have thrown at it, and can also play files streaming over my network: use File Manager HD to browse network shares and launch the videos with MoboPlayer.
B000W93CHC|4.0|I like the fine detail and the dramatic style of World without End.  The words flow in an interesting way, holding the reader's interest.  After reading Pillars of the Earth, had to read the sequel.<br />would recommend.
B003XQM2YU|3.0|The first half of the movie was great.  Suspenseful, interesting but then it began to fall apart.<br /><br />The battle scene was one of the most poorly executed and least suspenseful scenes I have seen in a long time.  And to make matters worse it was the grand finale of the movie and it just kept going on and on.  Kids on ponies as part of a battle charge?  Really?
0761169431|1.0|Book is good in theory as it contains many of the Star Wars characters and ships along with origami paper in the back of the book. The problem is that the projects are too difficult for children ages 9 and up along with some adults. Most of the projects have confusing directions and do not follow a logical pattern. I would not recommend this for anyone other than someone who is skilled at origami!
B008K6DU4Y|1.0|This player worked great on my rooted original Kindle Fire running Android Jelly Bean.  It is now offered through Amazon's app store for the Kindle, however on my new Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; it crashes every time about 30 seconds into watching a file--regardless of video format.<br /><br />Try MoboPlayer also in the Amazon app store--this has played everything I have thrown at it, and can also play files streaming over my network: use File Manager HD to browse network shares and launch the videos with MoboPlayer.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I thought the book painted a very real picture of Steve jobs and outlined so e of the critical battles that he fought that in turn changed the face of Apple and the world. The big downside to this book is that there are very few photos, maybe 5. I loved this book and it has a lot of life lessons within. Well done!
B008XG1X18|4.0|Whatever you can imagine and more is yours for viewing and saving on Pinterst. PIN IT!  Totally addicted.  So much to learn, see, read.  Pure inspiration
B0058EBNAO|1.0|My friend has this app on a Google Nexus and it works great so I bought it for my Kindle Fire.  Needless to say, it doesn't work the same.  You can't scroll from screen to screen.  The radar screen doesn't allow you to expand or cdontract with your finger tips and it takes forever to load.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This game offers beautiful scenes and challenging searches along with a very interesting storyline.  I highly enjoy playing Magic Academy: Hidden Castle.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green does it again in what can be described as a beautiful story of a young girl and boy who both are lucky enough to experience love. Cancer is at the forefront of this story, but there's more to it. Green has a way of instantly capturing your attention and caring so deeply for all characters involved.<br /><br />Highly recommend this book.
B009GIPDQS|3.0|The older John Grisham's are so much better. This one seems to be written an intent of creating a big thriller, but no real thrill
B007SO31BQ|4.0|This is must-have for any Formula 1 fan.  It was Senna/Prost rivalry that made me fall in love with this pinnacle of motor racing. The documentary has many fascinating behind-the-scenes clips that a fan would enjoy. Personally, it confirms my opinion that Senna is the greatest modern-era F1 driver to have ever lived.  Schumacher, while great in his own right, would likely not have seven titles to his name if Senna had not met an untimely death.
0307341577|2.0|Having read and enjoyed Sharp Objects and Gone Girl, I purchased this third novel. I would not recommend it, especially to readers who liked the author's previous books. I found the the main character to be extremely unlikable and the storyline was uninteresting. I only finished it because I paid for it. If you really want to read it, then take it out of the library. Not her best by a long shot.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved this book. The chemistry between Christian and Anna is so intense and romantic- s&m aside. Great Escape from the ordinary.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book held me captive for two days straight. Can't wait to read the next. Bring it on Hunger Games
B008HT4FUW|5.0|My wife is a big fan and once a week PBS would never quite satiate her appetite. Moreover, this original U.K. version has many scenes that were edited out in the PBS version. We are looking forward to getting the third season on DVD.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Its great strategic fun for any My Little Pony fan! Every child should get a chance to play it, because I'm sure they'd enjoy.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|Great games. Alawar games would get five stars from me every time if they didn't take so long to load onto my Kindle Fire.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a fun game to play. Although the formula is old the unique take on the genre gives it an edge over similar games. This game will definitely make the time go by fast. and keep the kids busy. Buy this game.
B0073XORCY|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how good this album is. I play it often and the sound is GREAT! Just as entertaining as the original Thick as a Brick for sure!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Plugged it in and it works fine. not much to say about a cable except that its a great cable for the price.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|This product was a x/mas gift for my child. The package arrived on schedule and intact. The product met all expectations
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|It's not a bad game, really, but it requires a lot of coins and that often requires money. I played it for a while before I realized just how much I was spending on it to keep it interesting for me and I promptly uninstalled it from my Kindle as I don't want to nickle and dime myself to no money. If you have more restraint over this or can afford it, it's pretty fun but it's just not really my sort of thing.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The third book of The Heroes of Olympus is a classic also cliffhanger, very reminiscent of the original Percy Jackson double trilogy.  Once again, you are left with an ending that leaves you desperate for the next three books, so you can find out what happens next to your favorite heroes!  It's terribly difficult to think that we have to wait until fall 2013 for the next installment. But, rest assured, the wait will certainly be well worth it!
B009K0P10K|5.0|This show was recomened by a friend.  UGH, This show is addicting and I dont even watch tv shows. I love it!

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm only sad that now the story is over. Best books I have read in a long long time. Going to read the books all over again.
B005OK721G|3.0|This is a revenge plot straight up, so it's not the destination that is important, it's the journey. This is a rough ride.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Zoe Saldana, as a young girl, sees her folks gunned down by a crime lord. She high-tails it from Columbia to the U.S. where she hooks up with her uncle, also on the wrong side of the law, where he teaches her how to be a top-notch hitman/woman. She does hits for her uncle while exacting revenge on anyone associated with her parents' killer. An FBI agent enters the fray trying to figure out who is performing these remarkable hits without leaving much in the way in clues.<br /><br />This is a Luc Besson written and produced flick and I'm surprised at how stupid some of the plot points were. This type of film needs to be clever and this was anything but. When we see her perform her first hit, in a jail no less, so many things happened that simply strained credulity. She has feigned drunkenness and, while supposedly sleeping it off, a guard leaves her a cup of coffee in a ceramic mug with a metal spoon. Maybe they do it like that in France, but in Chicago it's a paper cup and no spoon if there is any coffee at all!  Then she gets into her target's cell where he is asleep and wearing bling so big and heavy it could be used as a lethal weapon. Sorry. The bling stays at the booking desk. And the events that transpire giving the FBI agent the one clue he needs to track her down are so far beyond belief I'm amazed any writer could think he could possibly get away with it. The movie is replete with this sort of nonsense.<br /><br />As in all Besson projects, this has a slick sheen to it. It's shot and directed well. One hand to hand fight scene in the climax was about as good as anything I've seen. Music, editing and all that stuff are very top shelf. The performances from the key actors were as good as they could be given the script. But that's the problem. This suffered at the script level. This is a diverting watch to be sure, but I'm sorry I didn't stream it. As part of my library it will probably end up in my garage sale.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|i would reccomend this movie for any family on their family night.  i love how the writers finally put in the plot of why agent &#34;k&#34; is why the way he is and that agent &#34;j&#34; finally knows the truth about his father and how he actually got the watch.  it's everything i love to see in a family/comedy movie; and me and my kids enjoyed it.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|After all the good hype I thought it was going to be better than it was. Maybe it's my age but I've seen this same story so many times. The music was just OK, the acting was just OK. I really like Anna KIendrick so it was nice to know she could carry a tune but I could have skipped the movie and not missed any thing.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Obviously, is a wonderful movie just like the rest of the series. My dvd arrived quickly and in perfect condition. The DVD played pefectly and is a classic part of my collection.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|I've seen all 3, TDK,TDKR and ^Batman Begins. This is a great start to the movie, showed how Batman came to be instead of just jumping into fighting and bashing heads. Christian Bale and all of the other case members did a great job. *SPOILER* One thing to notice, is right after he saves Rachel from the poison, he tells her what to do with the antidote. He talks to her in his Batsuit, without his Batman Voice..interesting huh?
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Like almost every G5 game I've played on my Kindle Fire I loved it from beginning to end. Fun graphics help when you need it. Keep up the great work. My daughter and I love to play these type of games together,  so keep them coming.

B0041KKYGU|5.0|This movie is very funny.  I could not imagine having a teacher this bad, who didn't care.  It is a lot of fun to watch.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Boring not sexy at all, did not live up to the hype and expectation. Not my cup of tea I guess!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Have not found any issues so far, but the times have been pretty right on. Customizable and anything that someone might find annoying can be turn off.
B004QBWU02|5.0|A great, fun movie. An all time classic story. The music is amazing and it's great fun to see all the name actors that were so young and just starting there careers
1455805688|2.0|River God in the Egyptian series is a real disappointment. I'm a real fan of the Courtney series but this is just gory and boring
B007JMW46U|4.0|Excellent. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. The classics cannot be overlooked. I hope young people will try it.
B0086700CM|3.0|It is a fairly decent game. It is a bit buggy on the kindle fire so I did not give it a 5 star rating. it gets more challenging the farther you run but it has upgrades and other perks. It would be better if it did not glich that much.
141659521X|5.0|Always waiting for a new Vince novel! Plan on some good winter reading. Happy to find this book under the Christmas tree.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|This is truly a well designed film.  It has become a tradition in my home every year.  The DVD plays wonderfully and the picture is crystal clear.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Lightsaber.....check<br />Blaster...........check<br />Wookie..........check<br />Force.............check<br />Awesome......check<br />Its angry birds, its star wars, what more needs to be said. Why are you still reading this when you could be playing it?!!!!!
B000FC2KL0|5.0|Great book!  Learned a lot about Anthony Keidis and rhcp.  What a life he has had so far.  I recommend this book.
B006FE83UE|5.0|I gave it as a gift.  The person receiving it was very happy and thrilled to get it.  One of his favorite movies.
B009MO5G90|5.0|The story is confusing and disjointed at first.  I had to get well into the movie before I understood and accepted what was going on. Once I did &#34;get it&#34;  that all changed and it was great.  There is plenty of spectacular non stop 3D action.  AND NO GHOSTS!!<br /><br />Milla Jovovich is her usual, gorgeous self.<br /><br />No Oscar winner but, then, what the hell do &#34;they&#34; know.
B009E3EXMU|4.0|Led Zep is my favorite group so I was looking forward to this performance, knowing how good Jason Bonham is having seen him live a few times. My head was spinning after the first couple songs. Whoever edited this should be shot for ruining what was probably the last time we'll see these guys together. It's not rocket science. Just focus on one musician or the entire band for more than a millisecond. The visual effect of blurring a shot was a terrible idea. Also, for a Blu-Ray video the quality here is subpar. Not even in my top ten.<br /><br />Those criticisms aside, the band is tight, just a touch slower paced on some songs but understandable. Plant's voice is on key. Page's guitar work is as good as ever (hard to do without layering) and Jones's keyboard work on Kashmir is beyond good.<br /><br />Not the original, I know, but Page's performance with the Black Crowes \\"Live at the Greek\\" is just as good as this.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I enjoyed the original version with Ahhnold (no disrespect intended), and I'd read some reviews that like it better. I wasn't expecting much from the new version, but wound up enjoying it a lot. It ain't great film-making, and all the climbing and falling got a bit tiring, but I liked the basic story line, the acting was fine, and the f/x were excellent. I streamed it from Amazon Prime, and I'm adding it to my Blu-Ray wish list.<br /><br />Speaking of Amazon streaming, the quality was very good; no noticeable hiccups, picture and sound were fine. So glad I dumped the guys with the red logo...
B0086700CM|5.0|love this game for a quick challenging play. my kids got me on to temple run and we all love it.
B008CPZNL6|2.0|The user interface for this app is fun to use and easy to get the hang of.  The content is limited and made me uninstall the app after a couple of days.  Use the HuffPost app, it's much better.
B0087DFIOU|5.0|I had seen this film on netflix, so I wanted to find it on Blu-ray. Low and behold, amazon.com has it for sale. This film moves along right from the start. There are no slow spots really. Mel Gibson give a top-notch performance as a thief who lands in a Mexican prison. He does what he has to in order to survive and along the way befriends a Mexican boy and his Mom. There in lies the plot. It involves the boy, his Mom and organ donation (see the movie). Using his own brand of tricks and tactics, he foils the plans of the crooked prison warden and his henchmen. The film is a perfect blend of humor, action and drama.<br /><br />The cinematography is great, although the audio is on a see-saw, like many films these days. The sound effects are loud, but sometimes the dialogue is low. The action is quite good and even in slow-motion at times. There's plenty of behind-the-scenes documentary stuff for added interest too! If you like Mel and many of his films, you'll like this one as well. I highly recommend it.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|We watch a lot of movies, and this was not disappointing. Lots of action, maybe a little scary for the under 10 set.
B00A757EFW|3.0|It is not as easy to manipulate as I thought it would be, but it is still fun to play.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Pretty straightforward puzzles. Not terribly taxing on the brain. Good for wasting a little time. I sprang for the full version...
B005K17RU0|3.0|Very beautiful display.  Does not show amount of snow or rain predicted or details of the warnings unless you go to AccuWeather web site and then it is too small to read
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|not sure I'll need it but will be thankful when the time co es. Good app! I gave it four stars only because I took it when it was free. However, very nice tool.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was surprised by how much I loved this book. I typically don't read mysteries, if that's what you would call this, but it is so well written. The real definition of page turner.  Highly recommend it.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game it is awesome and I don't know why so many people have rated less then five stars it is the best game I have ever played
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Well, Colleen Hoover has done it again! She has created an incredible, amazing, captivating 5 star story that captures you on the first page and holds you tight all the way through. Once I started Hopeless, I literally could not put it down. I laughed, I cried, I screamed, and I even think my heart stopped a few times. To be honest, I am having a hard time putting into words my feelings for Hopeless. It's one of those rare stories that touches you deeply.<br /><br />&#34;The things that knock you down in life are tests, forcing you to make a choice between giving in and remaining on the ground or wiping the dirt off and standing up even taller than you did before you were knocked down.&#34;<br /><br />Much like Slammed and Point of Retreat, Hopeless is a story about life, love, loss, and revelations along the way that can change everything.  But don't get me wrong, Hopeless is so very different that Slammed and POR. I don't want to say too much about the story itself because I believe that experiencing every tiny piece is what makes it phenomenal.<br /><br />&#34;I don't know how this hopeless boy weaseled his way into my life this week, but I know I'm definitely not ready for him to leave.&#34;<br /><br />Sky is a 17 year old girl that has been somewhat sheltered. She meets Dean Holder, the typical bad boy. She is instantly intrigued by Holder and the feelings that he elicits in her.  What she doesn't expect is for her relationship with Holder to reveal truths that she didn't know existed and wasn't looking for.<br /><br />I absolutely fell in love with Sky and Holder. I truly experienced all of their emotions right alongside them.<br /><br />&#34;The sky is always beautiful . Even when it's dark or rainy or cloudy, it's still beautiful to look at.&#34;<br /><br />My feelings for Hopeless are not caught between like and love but instead far surpass love. Since I don't have a word for that, I'll go back to Slammed and POR and say, I butterflying loved it! It was somuch more than I had anticipated and it had an effect on me that I wasn't at all expecting.  All I can say is read it, experience it for yourself. You will not be disappointed. My only advice is to start it in the morning when you know you will have uninterrupted time to finish it because you are not going to want to put this one down!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Loved this book, as I did the first in this trilogy.  The only problem is that I wsh the last book were already available!  Follett is one of the best authors of historical fiction ever. Highly recommended.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Great movie - realistic subject matter and great acting.  Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones were very believeable in their roles.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Does exactly what it's advertised to do, except for the barometric pressure.  It always says 30 no matter where or when you look.<br /><br />Either make it accurate or remove it from the screen.<br /><br />Other than that, I like it a lot.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was fantastic... it was an emotional rollercoaster but it will have you hooked from page 1 until the very last page
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works like any calculator, plus it's free! Nice large display on my Kindle fire looks great and would be nice for those who need a large-format calculator.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|It is great fun an you won't want to put it down. You do get frustrated when it ends before you pass the level
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have read everyone of Tom Clancy's major novels and he has done it again! i have trouble setting his books down. I cannot wait for his next release.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I'm a sucker for a love story, but a story that is so real you can feel the love in your heart is impossible to put down.
0395389496|5.0|The Polar Express Illustrations are mysterious and engaging, story is also mysterious and a bit scary, appeals to adults and children.

B00A6N7BS0|4.0|action packed, acting no so great, decent story. Nothing more to say but still have to type to meet the minimum word requirement
B001QVFDA4|4.0|Wanted more of Snatch & Lock Stock, got what I wanted. Nine more words to submit this review... dinosaurs minotaurs.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Watched Faulty in its debut. The remastered DVDs are excellent quality. The comedy speaks for itself. Doesn't get any better.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Great movie, just a little violent at times.  It was a very good movie about the prohibition era of our country, the added violence was needed to show how it was during that era.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Started strong....ended ok, but I wasn't satisfied totally with the book.  I will recommend it to others....I just wanted a stronger conclusion without so many &#34;words&#34;.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't think that mere words can truly express how much I loved this book.  I experienced a myriad of emotions while reading this; fear, disgust, hurt, anger, shock, humor, hope, heartbreak, but most of all love.  The love that Holder has for Sky is beyond anything I have read in any romance novel ever.  This book is not only my favorite of 2012, but my favorite book of all time.  I knew Colleen Hoover was a great author.  I loved the Slammed series.  I just did not realize how fantastic she really is.  She will be an auto buy for me from now on.  I am completely at a loss on how to review this book.  I have never been so lost for words as I am now.  I don't think anything I say could possibly convey how incredible this story is.  Trust me when I tell you it is a must read.  There are so many twists and turns to this story that it will be impossible for you to put this down.  Make sure you have plenty of tissues, you will need them.<br /><br />Sky is a young woman who has had a horrible past that she only remembers little glimpses of in her nightmares.  She has an unfortunate reputation that she earned thanks to her friend Six.  Sky makes out with boys but feels nothing; she's just numb and wants more than anything to connect with someone; to actually feel something instead of a whole lot of nothing.  She meets Holder who she has an instant attraction to.  It's like nothing she has ever experienced and it terrifies her as much as it thrills her that she could feel this way.  Holder is very intense.  He recognizes something in Sky that reminds him of someone from his past.  As much as his intensity frightens her, she can't stay away from him.  They both want nothing more than to be near each other.  Sky soon finds out just how close they really are.  She will discover the past that she has blocked from her memory but what will it mean for her future?<br /><br />After reading this incredible story, I am at a total loss for what to read now.  Nothing else will come close to this and I think Ms. Hoover has officially ruined me for any other love story out there.<br /><br />\\"F____ all the firsts, Sky.

B009O2XY12|5.0|I love this app, remember me my childhoood. Addicting. I recomend it. For all family to play it, very good.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Woven expertly to keep you on the edge of your seat.  I'm only two thirds through, but loving it.  Well done!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|My niece wanted this for Hannukah.  She loved the movie--and so do her older brothers. Overall decent price, at least can watch at home and on rode.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This app makes the use of pdf files possible and works as advertised. The files display well and it is easy to navigate.
B0037UUZQY|4.0|As everyone has stated, this doll is adorable, but the hair is a hot mess. It does come out upon coming it.  Why? Who? What?  The whole purpose of the doll is to be able to comb the hair and watch the movie and enjoy Rapunzel the unencumbered Princess!!!  I may collect another Rapunzel doll after I read the reviews and make sure the doll hair does not come out. Lastly, My inner child loves the doll no matter what......kids are like that....blessings.<br />p.s. I just checked the reviews on several Rapunzel dolls including Disney's Tangled Rapunzel Doll -- 18''.  The story is the same....the hair,the hair, the hair.  It is falling out and must be kept in a thick braid.  I am glad i read that and I will do the same and leave a little of the braid undone for styling.  I am sure this hair problem is a sign of our weakening economy and companies trying to make a buck. I recently read that life size barbies are made of flimsy thin plastic. I have several older dolls with long hair and it is so durable! Oh well, there is still much fun to be had with dolls.<br />Update: I just went on Disney website after reading info from a doll collector that the hair is better on disney versus mattel doll. It falls out but not as bad and when it does the scalp does not<br />show.  I am buying from disney and returning mine to toysrus. a sale on disney 123012 for 2 for one.  20.00 for two disney princess 12\\" is another reason to buy from disney. i will spend four dollars more and get rapunzel and pochahontas. what a deal.......happy doll playing
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I love this game. I usually play it on my desktop. I'm so happy it's available on the kindle fire. now I can play it on the go.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book was really funny.  I think this was the best book in the series. Can't wait for more books!
B008K6HN8I|4.0|The app allows easy access to the folders on my Kindle Fire HD. Works as advertised and works very well.
B009NCM248|5.0|I was so excited for the release of HoGAB Part 1 and was not disappointed when it finally came out. Stone Sour rocks this album from beginning to end! Definitely worth adding to your collection!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Love playing every minute of it, the most hilarious game and it is unbelievable that is free!! Sooo worth playing!!!
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|This is one of the best live performances I have ever seen. I can watch/listen over and over and over!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Seldom do I read a book that captures my heart the way The Book Thief has.  The writing is astounding!  There were lines that I simply had to read over and over because the author has such a talent for putting words together.  I will read this book again and again.<br /><br />Liesel Meminger has had a life most would think of as hard, but she finds joy in the simple things...  Her best friend, her Mama and especially her Papa, not to mention Max.  Max the German Jew who lives under the stairs in the basement during Hitler's reign.<br /><br />Liesel loves books too.  She stole her first book the day they buried her brother.<br /><br />Death narrates this story that will touch you deep in your heart.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|I gave this as a gift so I can't really rate it except that the person to whom I gave it said it was great and they had wanted this for a long time.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|excelente pelicula. la hemos disfrutado al 100 porciento. la imagen en 3d es excelente.<br />los graficos de primer nivel.<br />gracias.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Snug and perfect fit for the Kindle fire. Great quality, not cheap at all which is what I was worried about. Looks great and i'd recommend it to everyone.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is one of my favorite books ever!!!!!!! I think anyone who loves this book as much as I do,would love Rick Riordan's Red Pyramid Books too!!!! THANK YOU RICK RIORDAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|My daughter got this dvd for Christmas and has watched it about six times in 3 days.  Christmas break, good down time!
B004YOEFG8|5.0|mi esposa es fan de este tipo de documentales acerca del universo.<br />ahora q compramos television en 3d fue lo primero q le compre.<br />lo disfruta al maximo incluyendome yo.<br />Gracias.
B004GYY714|2.0|The free app just could not play any of my radio stations. Just got one pop up window after the next . Paid the nominal fee for the Pro app ... Works far better.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Osmos is hypnotic in a wonderful way. Slowly propel your little orb through space. Suck up orbs smaller than you, avoid larger orbs lest you be sucked up. Sounds simple. Engrossing to play.<br /><br />Each level presents a different challenge; you may have to strategically push large orbs away with your propulsion blast while staying out of harm's way yourself, you may be circling a gravity mass while using your propulsion to change the shape of your orbit to best avoid or collide with other orbs, or you may be chasing intelligent blobs around a field as you each race to become the largest.<br /><br />This game is part puzzle game, part relaxation tool, part geometry and gravity experiment. Being able to easily adjust how quickly time passes as you glide is a nice touch.<br /><br />The background ambient music adds to the entrancing effect for the most part. There's one track I find irritating and distracting, but that's just personal opinion. For the most part the music is great.<br /><br />I've spent way too much time on this game. Make sure to have a clock nearby as you play, lest you find yourself awake far past your bedtime.<br /><br />I should also mention this is the first and only game I have purchased. I consider it well worth the money. (Purchased through Play Store.)
0811879542|5.0|This is such a great book for children who like to help with the story.  It is great for many ages.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|Thought it might be an exciting survival/ inspirational tale. Turned out to be a horror movie based on the mistaken belief that wolves are man-eaters. Hated it.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Connection did, updates are not always immediate, and sometimes they are just not posted. Will not allow tagging, or status sorting choice. Won't post my pics.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|The birdies are in space! Fling them across new scenarios, send them orbiting around planets, and collect those golden eggs while you're at it.<br /><br />This version of Angry Birds is a wonderful challenge that includes the effects of zero gravity as well as planetary gravity wherein you send the birds orbiting through the atmosphere to demolish pig towers that may be on the other side of a planet or other obstruction.<br /><br />I loved the new challenges, the graphics, and the spacey twists to the classic Angry Birds game.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger Games is written in such a way that tweens to 50 somethings can enjoy it (I know this for a fact!). It's a great story of heart, fighting for freedom, and love.<br /><br />At 24, I picked up the first book the same day as my last final exam of college (I had anxiously been awaiting having the time to read a NON required book!), and finished the third about a week later. Definitely an easy but entertaining read; and HARD to put down!!
B00466HM28|5.0|I like how it looks and it works well. I've used it for triggering vst's and tapping out rhythms. Also the knobs are helpful for controlling vsts. Connected and works with ableton with no problems or hurdles to start.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|After the hyper-serious but I'm not buying it snore-fest of MI-3 you would be forgiven for giving this a miss, but that would be a mistake. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to see past MI-3 and give the franchise another chance, you will be rewarded. Lawrence of Arabia it isn't, but it has rediscovered it's sense of humour, and Tom effectively takes the piss out of the easiest person on the planet to take the piss out of: Tom Cruise. Simon Pegg, much though I love him, is rather stale in his apparently ubiquitous role as comic relief, but none the less, the movie comes across as suprisingly fresh and fun. There is much more of a classic MI &#34;look, this is ridiculous nonsense but just go with it&#34; feel to MI-4, and if that is what you are looking for, you will be rewarded. This review will self destruct in, oh no it won't this is the Internet, this review will persist for a long time. Too too long.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Dang it, I haven't gotten as much done as I should since I downloaded this game.<br /><br />It's a simply concept, yet very addictive. Drop coins onto the table, the dozer pushes them forward. Various prizes appear, and if you collect a whole set of each style you are rewarded with helpful gifts.<br /><br />You start with a coin limit, but coins regenerate with time. Some prizes help coins regenerate faster. No need to purchase new coins unless you can't wait for more coins to appear.<br /><br />Tip: Change your device settings so the screen stays on for at least 20 minutes, then leave the game running and you'll have full coin regeneration after 20 minutes.
0525478817|5.0|The story was amazing. It wasn't one of those fairytale like stories where everything works out, but it was by far heart warming, and tear jerking. I would recommend this book to, not just to young adults.
B000SXMSJ0|4.0|I downlode this album because I alreay have the cd, but now have it on my kindle. Love this album....
B008MEM24S|5.0|its so flapping cool I love it to much its way better than angry birds even. it so cool .
B007HACDLK|5.0|Always worh waiting for Flynn's next book.  Very action packed, and worth the wait.  As usual, finished way too quickly and the waiting time begins again!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the easiest bible app I have ever used! I love that it offers so many different versions of the holy word. The black background with the white letters cuts back on that \\"Sunday morning glow\\" my pastor likes to tease about! :-)
