B0039TD8LW|3.0|The packaging on the Collectors edition is very cool as is the DVD, but the sound of the music is every nightmare that contributes to the sound of digitally formatted music today. I bought it with \\"cautionary expectation\\" as I am a big fan of the band, but you just can't escape the truth. However, you have to love the 6 Eye Columbia discs. I just wished this sounded more like that period. For excellent cd mastering, check out the Mob Rules and Heaven and Hell deluxe editions recently released. That is the way it should be done.
0385333846|4.0|First off this isn't science fiction. The premise that he transports to random points in his life is too simple a plot device to throw it in with the scifi genre. Not to mention it scares the regular fiction readers away, they don't like scifi because of the arduous names and detailed plots that often have little to do with the overall point of the story. Since this book doesn't contain those issues its only hurting the sale of the book.<br /><br />Next this book is an extremely entertaining book. It is written entirely as the internal workings of an observer to a very strange and sardonic life. Reminding me much of The Stranger, Vonnegut blends the detail of the environment in with the plot and observations of the narrator.<br /><br />Vonnegut's a cynical/realistic author who will remind you that life, no matter how depressing, is one big plot device of non-sense. You can't help but laugh to keep from crying. I actually did get teary eyed at the ridiculousness of the final scene where the author watches war in reverse and describes what he sees. Only a child's misconception of the world could bring tears to your eyes like he did.
B001OQCV2O|1.0|Horrible acting, stupid plot, and disappointing special effects.  A better ending would have had all the actors including the kids, as well as everybody behind the scenes who contributed to this shameless production, dying.  Getting smashed by a tidal wave or vaporized by molten lava would have been too good an ending for those who helped produce this.  Getting eaten by red ants over several hours or better yet days would be more fitting.  I'm pissed that I bought this thinking it would be worth a 2nd viewing.  It's the type of movie you last through the end because you're thinking the whole time that \\"it's got to get better than this.\\"  It never does!  Save your money and make better use of your time.  This movie is the biggest fraud of late that has been perpetrated on humanity.  Why isn't Barack doing a better job policing Hollywood?
0375854819|5.0|This whole book is an action packed on edge thriller all the way through. You will be on toes the whole time waiting for the next thing to happen. Its a perfect read and a perfect third book that went amazing with the first two. I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone who likes action packed (lord of the rings) storylines, and everyone who doesn't. We just need them go back and re-make Eragon to make it go with the book and another amazing story in the movie theatres
B002T9H2L0|5.0|This movie was just flat out entertaining as hell and totally unforgettable.  That Waltz guy was crazy good in this movie.  Sure it could have used a little more action and was dialogue heavy in parts but good all around.  Great acting and totally kept my attention for the full 153 min run time.<br /><br />Make sure you have the stomach for heavy violence before you pop this one in... but otherwise this one should not be missed.
B000OHZL1W|5.0|I have had the VHS version of Sneakers pretty much since it was first released.In fact it was my older Brother who told me about the movie. He gave me the cassette tape and I've been watching it ever since. Sneakers has a superb cast of actors. There is so much to like about this movie. Today, after all this time, I finally ordered the DVD. Now after all these years, although it would not be posssible in the absense of River Phoenix, it'll still be cool if they could get much of the original cast together and then filmed Sneakers 2......[[ASIN:B00008OE4W Sneakers (Collector's Edition)]]
B003405MF6|5.0|One of my favorite things about Jeff Beck is the diverse musical territory he's covered in his career. Previous records have had things that could be described as blues, metal, blues-metal (!), jazz-rock, rockabilly, techno, etc. Well, Beck stretches even further with Emotion & Commotion.<br /><br />Beck never overplays on this album. You never get the feeling that he just wants to show off what he can do on the guitar. The feeling you do get is that he can appreciate a song, whether it's \\"Over The Rainbow\\" where he \\"sings\\" (with his guitar) as sensitively as Judy Garland, \\"Nessun Dorma\\" where he shows the economy and power of Pavarotti, or \\"I Put A Spell On You\\" where he just shows his love of the song.<br /><br />The originals on the album are equally powerful. \\"Hammerhead\\" is a great, rocking, Jan Hammer-inspired composition with some very unexpected symphonic power. \\"Serene\\" is one of the most gorgeous things Beck has ever played.<br /><br />As far as guest vocalists go, the most successful is Olivia Safe who, like Beck, often seems to just melt into the song and is never overbearing. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for Joss Stone, who is just a bit much, especially on the original \\"There's No Other Me.\\" Imelda May is quite lovely on the Jeff Buckley song \\"Lilac Wine.\\"<br /><br />Ultimately, while I could do with out the Joss Stone performances, the rest of this album is so terrific, so sublime that it is still absolutely, positively a \\"5 star\\" album! Just be sure to turn it up to 11 - even on the mellow stuff!
160094048X|2.0|I've been a vegetarian for quite a while and have recently decided to go all the way and try being vegan. I was so excited about this cookbook since I tried a peanut butter cookie recipe from the author's previous book, Vegan with a Vengeance and they were a bit crumbly but really good. After reading the reviews here, I had no doubt in my mind that I'd be baking yummy vegan treats. First, I tried the Espresso Chip Oatmeal cookies and they turned out to be \\"a pile of crumbs\\". Tasty crumbs, but not the kind of cookie I could present to friends. Next I tried the Whole Wheat Chocolate Chip cookies and the regular Chocolate Chip cookies. The latter were the worst. At least I expected the \\"wholesome\\" ones to be a bit bland (they were) but when I made the regular ones, my family begged me to go back to making cookies \\"the old way\\". I'm an experienced cookie baker and followed the recipes to a tee, only when I made the last recipe (regular chocolate chip), I had to add more flour and I was still unable to \\"shape\\" the cookies the way the instructions state. That was the \\"icing on the cookie\\" for me and I've decided to return this book.

B0036B8MZU|5.0|This show is incredible! It's about time a show of this caliber was created. Full of twists, turns, back stabs, deceit, violence, blood, sex, nudity, four-letter-words, testosterone, great acting, sub-plots, sub-plots of sub-plots, and awesomeness. Don't let grandma watch this one, or anyone else that can't take all of the forementioned traits of this series in excess. I plan on pre-ordering the BDs and can't wait for Season 2 (which was pre approved before Season 1 aired).
B001EOQWF8|5.0|I've seen this movie many times before finally getting this BD version from Amazon.    Product is great, 2 discs, loads of extras. The Burn-E one is really hilarious!! lmao~~    WALL-E is so adorable and EVE's so cool yet so charming (still remember the way she smiles ?? ^^)~~ Cant love them more!!~~    Movie WALL-E is simply another all time classic animated movie from Disney! 5 Stars!!
B001OQCV6K|5.0|I went with the fam to see sherlock expecting to see a pretty good movie from everything I had seen in ads and wasn't expecting just how much i really ended up liking (loving if you will) this movie. On the outside it appears to have most of the generic big action blockbuster top of the line production features we've come to see as a requirement of any movie we go to see en masse at theaters. When I stop to think just what about the story/movie production it is that made this movie such a favorite of mine above other movies I cant really come up with any one special thing specifically. Its shot, written, historically/artistically reproduced made into the dif sets, and acted all extremely well (to me anyways)...but there are many other movies being made with just as high marks as well.....it's just.....a great overall movie in general i guess. What really sets in stone this movie as one of my new favs, to pick one, is the overall awesome performance done by robert Downey Jr and jude law both individually and with one-another. robert downy jr is an actor i've only recently began to appreciate when i watch his work and ive loved his acting in everything ive paid attention to thus far and he did amazingly in becoming a fresh new version of sherlock holmes. I havent talked to anyone yet who has seen the movie and didnt care for it, so i suggest in the very least rent it on netflix and see for yourself. I CANT WAIT for the sequal that i'm assuming pretty much without a doubt will be coming (at least it BETTER BE) based on the end of this one!
B0035J6TAI|4.0|May not satisfy the fan who is looking for another version of \\"SO.\\"  Not at all the typical cover album.  Refreshing arrangements and pretty clearly a personal project as described.  This seems like Gabriel is sharing something with his fan's that might be heard played in his own home.  Easy to listen to as a single track or a group of song's.  This was a good purchase for me.
0393314804|5.0|This is why I love reading challenges - they allow me to discover books I would have never picked up on my own. Let's face it, would I ever intentionally seek a book about Scottish low-lives - junkies, thugs, and prostitutes? Don't think so. But alas, the fate threw Welsh's \\"Trainspotting\\" my way and I ate it up like hot cakes.<br /><br />\\"Trainspotting\\" is a collection of short stories narrating scenes in the lives of a Skag Boys (skag = heroin) - Rents, Sick Boy, Begsbie, Spud, and various people around them - their families, lovers, drug suppliers, partners in crime, or victims. Mark Renton (Rents) is more or less is the protagonist, this is mostly his story, even though the stories are written from multiple points of view in 1st and 3rd person. The majority of them are also narrated in Scottish dialect, so some initial effort to understand is required.<br /><br />The best thing about this book is that it takes you on a roller-coaster ride - it takes you from revulsion to uncontrollable boasts of laughter to tears of compassion. Considering that every other word in this book is a profanity, I think Irvine Welsh has talent.<br /><br />\\"Trainspotting\\" starts off as a rather repulsive read - within the first 10 pages Rents is fishing out the drugs that he has just rectally ingested out of the filthy overflowing public toilet. The repulsive factor doesn't really go away as the story progresses, we are faced with psycopath Begsbie who is extremely abusive to everyone around him, including his girlfriends, or Sick Boy who is very popular with women and at some point becomes a pimp of a few of them, or Rents himself, who drunkenly has sex with a 14-year old girl or shags his dead brother's pregnant fiance in the bathroom during his funeral. The list goes on and on. But the thing is, in spite of all these depravities, Skag Boys are strangely relatable and, dare I say it, often likable. They are losers and addicts and criminals, but their emotional and moral struggles are real.<br /><br />The book is, although very dark, at the same time hilarious, it is filled with Rents' sarcastic humor. This quote from the scene can give you a good taste of the writing.<br /><br />Here Rents is held by his parents under the house arrest. They are attempting to get him off the heroin, Rents' mom is trying to feed him.<br /><br />\\"The auld girl sticks us in the comfy chair by the fire in front ay the telly, and puts a tray oan ma lap. Ah'm convulsing inside anyway, but the mince looks revolting.<br />- Ah've telt ye ah dinnae eat meat Ma, ah sais.<br />- Ye eywis liked yer mince and tatties (potatoes). That's whair ye've gone wrong son, no eating the right thing. Ye need meat.<br />Now there is apparently a casual link between heroin addiction and vegetarianism.\\"<br /><br />In the latter part \\"Trainspotting\\" is no longer a repulsively hilarious read, it gets darker and darker, as we follow the fates of Rents' many friends, and it's not pretty - too many of them are dying - from HIV from sharing needles, from cancer, gangrene, heart attacks. Seeing this many deaths, 25-year old Rents attempts to kick his habit over and over again, but will he and his friends succeed?<br /><br />I think \\"Trainspotting\\" is a remarkable read and I will definitely read more of Welsh's work. But is this book for everybody? Absolutely not. It is filled with human depravities, profanity, and written in Scottish dialect. This will turn off many readers. But if you are looking for a challenging (in many ways) read, give \\"Trainspotting\\" a try.

0060012234|4.0|Geography Club is a young adult book that doesn't feature a gay utopia but instead depicts a realistic high school with students that aren't especially noble or inspiring. These are the types of teenagers that exist in every high school, struggling to get through the minefield of social acceptance and rejection with the added pressure of being different. There is no preaching about accepting differences but the story ends with a note of hope and the idea that high school may be horrible but you'll get through it. This may not be a high school story you wish happened to you but it also is one that some teenagers may relate to.    The story follows several teenagers as they realize they are not alone and end up trying to form a support group for themselves. They call their club the Geography Club assuming that no one else would join something so incredibly boring. Their plan doesn't necessarily work that well as someone does want to join and at the same time, a rumor about a gay club circulates and threatens the secrecy of Geography Club. Each teenager must decide for themselves if they want to be honest about their sexuality or not and the choice is not easy for most. In an already hazardous social climate of high school, being gay may be too much to deal with.    GC is incredibly quick to read and fast paced so the story whips along and ends almost before you know it. The teenagers all play on different stereotypes from the male jock to the lesbian field hockey player, the nerdy ones, and the outsiders. Here is a cross section of kids from popular to neutral that have very little in common usually but find the support of other gay teens incredibly helpful. They are not always likable and noble as they are often too mired in their own drama and angst to reach out beyond their group. There is the most hated and teased outsider in the school that even those in the Geography Club don't want to reach out and help. They often make classic mistakes such as being mean, condescending, and betraying each other out of fear and petty grievances.    What makes the story really shine are that these are depictions of real high school students who don't always do the right thing. These teenagers don't necessarily want to come out of the closet and be honest with themselves and others just yet. Perhaps they accept their sexuality to themselves but they want to stay hidden and under the social radar. Others stand up for their beliefs and what is right. Some waffle in the middle and can't decide which way to go, depending on peer pressure to make their decisions. These are not perfect people but teenagers learning and growing with one more issue to cope with on top of everything. This is the type of story that teenagers can relate to and realize others go through the same difficulties and they're not alone.    The narrative is first person from Russell's point of view, a nerdy socially neutral teen that goes through the entire roller coaster of emotion and popularity in his struggle to find his place. The descriptive quality and writing doesn't try too hard but lets the voice of the teenagers come through very well. The high school exists in no named city or state but is meant to be a high school that could exist anywhere with bland, purposefully vague descriptions that are recognizable by anyone. Although conveying a message to readers, none of the writing is preachy or lecturing but does have a thread of hope and honesty that will appeal to readers.    Although the target audience is likely gay teenagers, the quick pace and very easy reading makes this a good book for anyone to read. The recognizable themes and lack of perfection create a book most can relate to even if you aren't part of the target audience. If anything it will remind you that no one is alone in their struggles. I can easily recommend Geography Club as a good book to read.
0307454541|2.0|Could not get interested in this book. Names are hard to pronounce and characters are dark.  I like a book that grabs me in the first few pages, this one did not do that.  Was disappointed.
0446569895|5.0|This book goes a long way in explaining why Ozzy is so f'ed up. He can't always remember all the exact details but all the major events are in there. Once you get use to all the British slang the book is hard to put down. I suppose it's a good thing that it's not an audio book because who can understand what the he'll he's saying. It will make a good movie.
1421532255|2.0|After reading the manga and the corresponding anime series, I found this book almost insulting in sophistication.  I found every chapter extremely transparent in terms of what was happening and nothing at all that added to the Death Note universe.  After being on such a high after finishing the manga, this was a real downer and I wish I had not bought this book.
B0037W68F4|5.0|On the whole, this album is slower than Oracular Spectacular, but the music is at least as good, I found the voice melodies even better and richer. It is perhaps less accessible and \\"spectacular\\" than OS at first, but Congratulations will quickly grow on you.  Many songs have music and vocals that build up progressively, so it's impossible to evaluate this album if you listened only to the first 30 seconds samples.    1. It's Working: Eerie vocals, catchy melody. Great introduction to the album.  2. Song for Dan Treacy: The first half is good but it's the last part that really makes up for it.  3. Someone's Missing: Again, a good start (voice is a tad too unnatural) that ends even better.  4. Flash Delirium: Fantastic song and lyrics.  5. I Found a Whistle: Such a sweet song, catchy melody too. Pretty OS-like.  6. Siberian Breaks: 7 different melodies (and one instrumental) into 1 song, the 5th part (@6:08) is a great trip!  7. Brian Eno: Very funny and the catchiest song of the album.  8. Lady Dada's Nightmare: Instrumental only. Again, starts slowly and builds up to more complex patterns.  9. Congratulations: Another OS-like and slow song, my least preferred, but this is likely to change with time, as I can already tell I am getting to love the whole album more and more with each listen.    Highlights: I Found a Whistle, Brian Eno, Flash Delirium, It's Working, Siberian Break.
0743216458|4.0|This offers an historian centered view of E Company while showing much of the same personality as the HBO drama. However, the acting in the miniseries is outstanding, moreover, the HBO series also has interviews with the surviving E company soldiers which are incredible. Why only read about these individuals when you can practically meet them? Having watched the series first I was continually picturing the actors and thinking of the interviews while reading the book. In effect the series brought things to life whereas the book is a little dry. It is a good read and I would recommend it but I would recommend the series more. Why not do both?
B000YZDLZM|5.0|This remastered version of Walls and Bridges sounds superb. If you are going to buy a copy, make sure you buy this Japanese re-issue, packaged as an exact copy of the lp. Thus with fold- and cut-out cover, inner sleeve and booklet with drawings made by John as a child and lyrics. Every other version is inferior to this one, get this version now while stocks last!
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Some people don't like Tony Bourdain. I do. The guy doesn't put on airs. What you see is what you get. And in this book, what you get is a down-and-dirty look at life in the trenches of a restaurant kitchen. Do you know who's cooking your meals? You'll know them a little bit better after reading this book, and maybe appreciate them a little bit more. Sprinkled with liberal amounts of Bourdain's sarcastic wit and more than a dollop of self-depreciation, Bourdain's point of view is the perfect one from which to have your window into the world of professional cooking.
1862056242|5.0|This book is B-E-AUTIFULY done. The pages are crisp and easy to turn. They are chalk full of interesting facts of all the main creatures in the dark crystal (gelflings, skesis, mystics, pod people e.t.c). The beautiful art work in the book and the advanced knowledge of the creatures from the dark crystal gives any fan sure fire indepth looks into the mind of brian froud and the world he created. Any die hard fan of the series will enjoy this book. Giving you all the information leading up to the dark crystal(the movie), the major events in the series, and how it all comes together in the end.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I can see why this documentary film was nominated for an Oscar.  It is very even-handed and honest.  It really woke me up to realizing how important it is to know where your food comes from and how it is produced.  I have made major changes in where I buy my food as a result of watching this film.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|So, after this movie was recommended to me buy multiple family members, I finally decided to give it a shot.  Even though I had an idea about the food industry, I had no idea what the big picture actually was.  I was so disturbed on so many levels that I will no longer purchase certain brands of products.  I was also pretty upset about how some of these workers are being treated.  My favorite part was the small sustainable farmer in Virgina.  He was so right, if we were willing to pay a little more for the food that we put in our bodies, we could go to that type of farming for most of the country.  I felt so bad for the mom who lost her 2 year old son.  As a mother of an almost two year old, it makes me think twice about what I may buy at the grocery store or what I give her when we eat out.  It is amazing to think that we may complain about the cost of meat (especially boneless chicken breasts) yet stock up on cans of soda which are 4 for $10.  Overall, this was a very eye opening movie that I think everyone should see.  It wasn't enough to make me go vegetarian, but enough to change the way I purchase food. There are multiple sites out there that allow you to search for sustainable farms in your area, I encourage you to check it out...as well as your local farmers market if you can find one!
1400063515|5.0|Mr. Taleb's The Black Swan is an exceptionally thought-provoking work sure to be relevant for a long, long time. There is not much to add to the 500+ reviews, so I'll just say NTT's Black Swan is good enough to read again before months end. Well done, sir!
B0000A5BSZ|5.0|As so many have said, this is a Great film!  If you're just looking for a quick shoot-'em-up, then this isn't for you, but if you want story, character and to see what movies are all about, this is one of the films that will show you.      If you look at the Charles Bronson character, it seems pretty clear that the part was written around, or at least for, Clint Eastwood.  When he turned it down, the part was offered to Charles Bronson, who ironically had turned down A Fistful of Dollars.  It's definitely Charles Bronson there, but you can see how Clint's portrayal of the Man with No Name (yes, I know he's called \\"Joe\\" in one of the movies, but let that slide) would fit in perfectly.      I don't know if it was Sergio Leone's intention, but this movie can also be thought of as the fourth, and greatest, installment in the \\"Dollars\\" saga.  One can look at the original three as not being filmed in chronological order, with TGTB&TU, although filmed last being actually the \\"first\\" film of the those.  It's in that one that Clint Eastwood comes into possession of the serape, and he doesn't seem as cynical as he does in the \\"later\\" (but filmed earlier) parts of his life.   If you buy that, then Once Upon a Time in the West is the \\"earliest\\" movie, where we learn the origin of the Man With No Name.      In any case, this is an incredible movie superbly photographed with a magnificent soundtrack.   Since it's apparently discontinued on DVD, let's hope that someday soon the studio will decide there's enough of a market and make the uncut version available on a quality Blu Ray.  It certainly deserves it, and so do we.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|I had been waiting for the Blu-Ray versions of Blade Runner.  Lots of commentary and well worth the price of entry.  I particularly like that this compilation has the original screenplay version with Harrison Ford's voiceover.  I'm one of the few, apparently, who thinks that is the best version.  When I watch one of the other versions, I always miss Harrison Ford's voice guiding me along.  I also like it's happy ending.  In this set there is a European voiceover version that has longer action sequences.  That's the best version of all, IMHO.
0380789035|3.0|I got a headache trying to review this novel. It's not really a horror book. The action is minimal. A lot of the scenes are mundane as hell. It has forays into introspection. Man oh man...Was Mr. Gaiman trying to emulate John Updike, Stephen King, Christopher Moore, all of the above, none of the above or did the author get into a bad batch of psychedelic mushrooms? Some of the passages are simply outstanding. You get to truly inhabit the characters. Yet, the main protagonist, Shadow, seems to be sleepwalking through the whole thing. He is unbelievably nonchalant about so many otherworldly events, it was difficult to swallow Shadow's reactions as plausible. In reality, any normal human being would have soiled themselves a hundred times over. When it comes to the Gods, they're enigmas wrapped in ciphers and smothered in secret sauce. I kept plowing through this thing because I hate not finishing a book once I've started reading it. Clearly, a lot of readers absolutely looove \\"American Gods.\\" As for me, I've got to go lie down now. My head still hurts from this Alice-in-Wonderland thingamajig. Maybe you'll have better luck with it. Good luck.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I have read all 4 of Emily Giffin's books and Something Blue was by far my favorite. I never read a book that gave the point of view of the other person like we see in Darcy.  I fell in love with her character even though you view her as a bitch in Something Borrowed that's why it was so diferent to see a different view. Loved it.
B002VECM4A|5.0|I was \\"Precious\\" once and it was very healing to see this on the \\"big screen\\".  I'm so happy someone took the time to produce this pic.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I was so excited to see this movie. It was shown at a small artsy theatre which made it feel like I was walking back in time upon entering the theatre. It only shows two movies at a time, usually independent films. The personal, friendly atmosphere was so different than the mainstream theatres that I usually go to - and the seats were amazingly comfortable. I really am a firm believer that where you are influences the way you perceive things - it was a very enjoyable experience, even if we were the youngest people there!<br /><br />I think that they picked the perfect actor and actress for Albert and Victoria. Emily Blunt carried herself perfectly as a princess and a queen. She could easily evoke all of the emotions and feelings that were required of the role. I very much enjoyed Rupert Friend as Albert. An actor who I considered a scene stealer was Mark Strong as Sir John Conroy. It took me a little while to figure out what his relationship was to Victoria and her mother - for quite awhile I thought he was her father!<br /><br />The settings were gorgeous. I'm not sure if they looked how they should or how much of it was real vs. CGI, but it was eye candy. I loved when they went into Buckingham palace for the first time - it was so breathtaking! It certainly made me want to visit England.<br /><br />My favorite scene was the chess game between Victoria and Albert early in their friendship. I have included it above for your viewing pleasure. It evoked some laughter in the theatre and I loved how they compared Victoria's life to the chess game. My second favorite scene was where Albert takes a bullet marked for Victoria. Although, from what I hear, this never happened in real life, I actually really liked that scene. Very dramatic.<br /><br />My boyfriend did not want to really see the movie - but went anyway. Upon being questioned as to what he thought of it, he replied, \\"it wasn't that bad, not what I expected\\". So, for someone totally not interested in royalty, I will take that as a stellar review.ew.
B0035G9ABQ|5.0|As has been the case for the last half century, the merits of popular music upon release are determined by how well the products stack up to (and augment) previous releases by the same band. This can create an enormous amount of pressure for musicians, since they have to find that precise balance between sounding \\"like the band\\" and also not merely copying themselves. Every band pulls this off (or not) to a different degree of success, but, to my ears, I believe the Gorillaz have come up with a product that well satisfies both requirements.    Plastic Beach DOES evoke the Gorillaz sound; check out Rhinestone Eyes, Stylo, and Broken. Those three are a great encapsulation of the traditional Gorillaz vibe, production, and presentation. Conversely, as numerous reviewers have already pointed out, the album also slashes out in new directions for the band. It is true that it does seem to have more drastically-shifting styles than past albums...but I found the others to have their stylistically bizarre cuts as well (I'm looking at you, Latin Simone, Hip Albatross, Don't Get Lost In Heaven, DARE, and We Are Happy Landfill). So I don't think it's horribly out-of-character for them to further this side of the band, as some reviewers are up in arms about.    There are two things I dislike about the album, however: Plastic Beach's tone is REALLY hard to pin down. What do the Gorillaz want the listener to feel, or what category of existential journey are we taking this time? I don't know...I find it harder to get empathically connected with what Albarn is trying to do this time around, and it certainly doesn't help how often the mood itself shifts around. The other is the superfluous number of guest artists appearing. I'm sure everyone will appreciate some guests more than others...but I really think they should have had more solo \\"Gorillaz\\" songs, if they were wanting it to feel more like an album. Even the guests who I felt clicked, or even added to the uncertain \\"theme\\" of thealbum, take away a bit from the experience of this being a virtual band. It's almost as if Albarn and co. had become self-conscious about how they wanted the Gorillaz to sound this time, so they covered up their hesitance with TONS of guest spots.    So why the five-star rating? Well...there aren't many albums released these days in which almost EVERY song has something to offer. I have never given five stars to so many songs on one album before; the consistency is remarkable, ESPECIALLY given how often the styles are switched up. I can forgive the guest artists' presence for how well the songs work.     I will confess that I was VERY resilient to liking the album at first...I listened to previews of each track and liked a whopping ONE track. My first listen to the album didn't impress me either. The second time around, however, and every time thereafter, I somehow \\"cottoned on\\" to what I feel Albarn was trying to do with the album, although it's incredibly difficult to put into words. And I liked it. Very, VERY much. It's now my favorite Gorillaz release (I feel that the others, while more powerful in their high points, have much more filler...sorry Demon Days fans).    As a side note, there were two sections of the album that really gave off a vibe of songs from other bands: the Superfast Jellyfish's last quarter sounds nearly exactly like the coda on the Super Furry Animals' song \\"Lazer Beam\\" (if you like Superfast Jellyfish, I recommend this song), and the darkly electronic intro to the Plastic Beach track sounds, to me, like a cross between Pink Floyd's \\"Empty Spaces\\" and Genesis's \\"In The Cage\\"...in other words, very good! Those don't bother me at all, I just thought they sounded astonishingly similar, which is at least interesting. (Granted, the Super Furry Animals frontman himself sings on Superfast Jellyfish, so I doubt the similarities there were unintentional)    In summary, don't go off the previews when considering buying this record...you would do better to listen to entire cuts (my favorites are, handily right next to each other in the track listing, Some Kind of Nature and On Melancholy Hill), as the songs (like all Gorillaz songs) have a groove and drive that only become apparent as the entire track is considered.    I hope everyone will at least give this record a chance. I believe you won't be sorry you did.
B0033DOIHC|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I am not usually a fan of murder mysteries but I kept hearing about this book so finally I downloaded a sample to my Itouch.  I was mesmerized so I bought it and just got hooked.  I am planning to buy the three book set because these are a must for my home library.  I love the way Mr. Larsson writes and I fell in love with his characters.  The stories are unique and fresh.  I was so sad when I discovered that the author died just after he finished the third book.  Don't miss these books.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This movies was the greatest I have seen in a long time. Every aspect about it is cool, from the action, to the romance, to the drama, to the digital effect, to sooo much more. Brilliantly directed too! I keep hearing about this first release not having all the features, and my motto \\"Me ne frego\\", or I dont give a damn. this is a terrific movie! One for the ages, and at the price is fine by me. ALSO really? Do you REALLY want to wait for some bonus features that your gonna watch one or twice? Get this edition then when the third edition comes out grab that. Dont even bother with it. This IS the movie that was in theaters, what won crowds over globaly! Get it, you wont regret it!
B002UZXJA6|5.0|The product and speed of delivery were very good.  I would buy from this company again.
0385341008|5.0|This was a book club selection, and not one I would have picked myself.  Typically WWII books don't appeal to me.  However, I was so happy that someone in my book group selected this!  The book was a quick read, and was so enjoyable.  I actually really liked the format - letters between the characters.  The writing is witty and sincere and gives you a true feeling of each character.  And, not your typical WWII book (you won't be bogged down with history, trust me).  This is one I will recommend to all of my friends.
0132350882|3.0|I was looking forward to read this, given the very interesting literature I have read in the past years that was authored by the book author.  But somehow, something about his book let me down, and returned it.  There are some books that I go back to them to read upon again on a chaper or passage, get more insight, or show it to a collegue.  One such book could be \\"Refactoring to Patterns\\".  But this book doesn't have that quality in balance of prose and presentation.  Some chapters are surprisingly small.  One chapter, loaded with a case study of code refactoring, is huge.  Also, the illustrations, although funny at times, give somewhat of an amateurish imprint to the overall book image.  I got somewhat an impression that it was an amalgamation of several past years of slides and presentations and tutorials, collected together.  Also, the usage of \\"bean\\" as a word is so passe'.  Yes, all examples are in Java (nothing wrong with that, but keep the programming-language-specific terminology out... Joshua Bloch wrote \\"Effective Java\\" and it is being read by C# programmers as well)
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|One of the other reviewers mentioned that \\"it would be insanity to show [this film] to small children.\\"  I can only conclude that I must have been a very unconventional child.  I originally saw this movie when I was about 3 or 4 years old.  It was surreal, beautiful, (and I will admit) a little shocking for me at the time ....and I absolutely I fell in love with it from that moment on. A couple of years later they also aired it in two parts on the Magical World of Disney, and I made sure I was there for both nights.  At nine I was able to record it off TV, but missed a small part of the begining.  I especially appreciated the effects and costumes for Tick-Tock, Jack, Mombie, and the Wheelers, as well as the atmosphere for the entire movie-from the claymation Rock Gnomes, to Mombie's gilded and mirrored palace.  In a way, it reminds me very much of one of American McGee's offerings (in fact he did have plans to do a Wizard of Oz treatment in addition to his Alice game).  The heroine returning to a fantasy land-that may or may not be in her imagination-only to find in it ruins and ruled by monsters.  In the end, kingdom and sanity is restored.    Incidentally, I'm also continually baffled that the Disney/Hot Topic marketing connection hasn't glommed onto this movie like they have other darker childrens' offerings, pulling them out from arguable obscurity or cult status, and giving them a second run.  \\"The Dark Crystal,\\" or \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" for example. That's probably a good thing in the end, though.   From what I hear, there was/is some type of feud/blacklisting thing that went on between the company and one of the individuals involved in creating this film, so Disney intentionally curtailed this film's attempts at success.  Apparently that may still be going on if Disney is still failing to promote it in any way.
B000002U82|5.0|Dark side of the moon is easily one of my most enjoyed albums. Speak to me/Breath, appropriately placed in the beginning of the album because it really is the intro to the album. Speak to me has strong roots in Musique Concrete, a genre of music that features acoustic (undistorted) sound samples. The sound samples \\"Speak to me\\" uses are from pieces in the latter part of the album, like the clock ticking from \\"Time\\", laughter from \\"Brain Damage\\", coins/cash register from \\"Money\\", helicopter-like sounds from \\"On the Run\\" and the screams from \\"The Great Gig in the Sky.\\"  Breath is rather a slow but rebirthing type of song; the chord progressions are very colorful and interesting.    The end of \\"Breath\\" leads into \\"On the Run\\". An instrumental piece that use cool synthesizer sounds from EMS synthesizers. The synthesizer created helicopter-like sounds (which sounds like a video game level in my opinion) giving you the illusion of movement (or running like the title).     The end of \\"On the Run\\" leads right into \\"Time\\". It sounds like waking up to an old-fashioned alarm clock. After the alarm clock/chime/bells collage fades out, a rototom (shell less drum) produces a low \\"tick-tocking\\" beat in the background into a drum solo. This song really makes you think about how time disappears rather quickly without thinking.     The Great Gig in the Sky: another instrumental piece. It is pretty obvious that this song is about death, the emotions conveyed (without words) by Clare Torry are great and very powerful.     Money- This song is distinct because of the money sound intro. It makes great use of coins, cash registers, paper tearing samples into a catchy riff that are used in the rest of the song. The samples are then arranged to a 7 beat measure making it 7/4 time signature. However for the guitar solo, the time signature changes to 4/4 then back to 7/4 time again. In this piece, they used real time double tracking to produce a \\"bigger\\" sound. Double tracking is a form of overdubbing, which is a clever way to amplify parts of the song. Saxophone solo also makes an appearance and makes Money a \\"blues\\" and rock mix.     Us and Them - This song is the longest song of this album. I enjoy the use of the Hammond organ as well as the saxophone solos.    Any Color You Like - yet another instrumental track. An interesting technique used was the synthesizer that was fed into a tape loop to create the rise/falling sounds of the keyboard solo. The guitar was most likely hooked up to a Leslie speaker or an effect that sounded like a Leslie, which gave the guitar sound delayed or Doppler effect. Because of the similarity of Any Color You Like with Breathe, this song is also known as Breathe reprise.  Brain Damage/ Eclipse - This is the climax and conclusion of the album, the lyrics are chosen so that it fits with the theme of the album name.     Overall, this is a great album to listen to especially how each song is not discrete but fades into the next song. A+++ would listen again, highly recommended.
0802798225|5.0|Rating: 4.5/5 Stars<br /><br />THIS REVIEW DOES CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS!!<br /><br />About the Book: Brittany and Alex are opposites. Brittany is a rich girl, Alex is a gang member. Brittany makes sure her life appears perfect, Alex tries to keep up a tough guy image. When the two are assigned to be chemistry partners, their lives collide and personalities clash. But as they learn more about each other they realize their lives aren't so different and that the chemistry they share can't be denied.<br /><br />GreenBeanTeenQueen Says: This is one hot book! I had read lots of great reviews about this one, had my teens tell me how good it was, but it wasn't until I saw there was a sequel coming out that I knew I had to hurry up and read this one. I tore through it. If you ever find yourself in a reading slump, pick up Perfect Chemistry and it'll pull you right in.<br /><br />We got rid of our romance genre in young adult in my library, but if we still had it, this book would be a perfect fit. This is a typical romance-they dislike each other, they start to like each other, there's miscommunication, and SPOILER a happy ending. Sure, it's somewhat predictable and parts of it were a little corny, but I ate it up anyway.<br /><br />I wasn't sure I would like Brittany-or Alex for that matter. From the description they seemed like characters I would find obnoxious. But from the start I loved them both. I felt sorry for Brittany and she wasn't the rich girl snob I thought she'd be. Alex was a bad boy, but not so much a bad boy because he wanted to be, but because that was what life had handed him. I really liked this spin on the stereotypes.<br /><br />I also really liked the alternating chapters from Alex and Brittany's point of view. Sometimes when I read books like that I find myself checking pages to see when the character I like will be appearing again. But I enjoyed both Alex and Brittany and they were great together as well as on their own.<br /><br />There were some things about their relationship I didn't like-SPOILERS I really didn't like how Brittany went to the garage to seduce Alex. I thought that was a dumb way to try and get him back. I don't know-just didn't work for me. Also, the epilogue was corny, but I almost didn't care. It was exactly like something my sister always wished for in movies-she didn't just want a happy ending, she wanted the whole rest of the story. I'm hoping she'll pick this book up just because I know she'll get a kick out the ending!<br /><br />The romance is hot, the characters are great, and it's a fast fun read. There is a lot of language-Alex is in a gang, and there are sexual situations-Alex and Brittany are seniors in high school so this isn't a light clean romance. For readers who want a great romance with lots of swoon worthy moments give Perfect Chemistry a try. I'm looking forward to Rules of Attraction just so I can visit with Brittany and Alex once again.like how Brittany went to the garage to seduce Alex.

B0034JKZ3G|4.0|It's a well-known term that you have to miss something to really appreciate what it means to you. That's also the case with hand drawn animation from Disney. Between the years of absence of a hand drawn flick (2004 to 2009), I re-discovered and re-appreciated Disney classic hand drawn features again. While 2007's \\"Enchanted\\" had some animated parts (which were wonderfully animated), it was a sign of relief when I heard about Disney planning to make a full-length hand drawn feature again. And hardcore Disney fans have no reason to worry; \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" is definitively worth a watch and it's more compelling than Disney's recent hand drawn features, which were \\"Brother Bear\\" and \\"Home on the Range\\" (in spite of enjoying the latter movie a lot)<br /><br />This movie may not be one of Disney's very best features, but it's still a watchable and enjoyable feature which is worth to recommend to every Disney fan. Just don't expect a sweeping, grand adventure - this is after all John Musker and Ron Clements', which were behind \\"The Little Mermaid\\", \\"Aladdin\\" and \\"Hercules\\", work. If you're going in for a lighthearted, fun adventure, then you'll be certainly pleased.<br /><br />\\"The Princess and the Frog\\" does certainly have the feel of a Classic Disney Movie (at least those from the 90's), although the segments on the Bayou does bring back memories to a Don Bluth movie as well, without that being a disadvantage. Although the beginning is a little slow, the screenplay is mostly quite solid, bringing humor, adventure, romance and emotion into a cohesive unit. Since this after all a Disney movie, there ought to be a moral and a nice one as well, although you would wonder how a Disney could possibly work without a moral.<br /><br />The characters are quite passable and the directors have made them appealing to the youngsters, but they've also made Prince Naveen the strongest Disney male in a long time and Facilier one of the most charismatic villains ever. Although the supporting characters may not be the most memorable ones in Disney history, they still appear as acceptable and evocative. They share great chemistry together, especially the two lovebirds.<br /><br />With the exception of some badly drawn townspeople, the animation is top-notch, both scenery and character design. As other Disney fans, I worried about Randy Newman's music, since I've never found his work for Pixar particularly noteworthy or memorable. But fortunately that isn't the case by \\"The Princess and the Frog\\", the songs are listenable and fun and flow nicely with the movie.<br /><br />BONUS FEATURES<br /><br />This review is based on the Combo Pack Edition, which is definitively recommendable for fans who want the film on both blu ray and DVD - and an extra disc with a digital copy. But for those who want to check out more special features, should definitively go with the Blu ray edition, since most of the extras lie there.<br /><br />Both the DVD and the blu ray edition include an Audio Commentary by directors John Musker and Ron Clemens, along with producer Peter Del Vecho. The trio provides an informative and listenable commentary, full with details of the production, story and character insights and animation. Not the very best Audio Commentary I've heard in my life, but neither far from the worst and it's the most recommendable of the features on the whole Combo Pack Edition.<br /><br />Next up are a few deleted scenes, the music video from Ne-Yo's \\"Never Knew I Needed\\" (which by the way doesn't includes clips from the movie) and a game called \\"What Do You See: Princess Portraits\\", which is fun on its own merits, but nothing memorable.<br />On the blu ray is where the most interesting stuff lies. Or is it? Well, at lest you can play the movie in two versions; one regular one and the other with \\"Work in Progress\\". The latter is quite interesting, if you're a hardcore fan of the movie.<br /><br />\\"Bringing Life to Animation\\" is some life-footage references of two of the scenes in the movie; The Proposal and the musical sequence \\"Dig A Little Deeper\\", along with the director's commentary. It's quite informative and interesting to look at.<br /><br />Next up is \\"Magic in the Bayou: The Making of a Princess\\" (22:11), which looks at the production as a whole. Although some parts of the production are interesting, the whole featurette comes off as a mild disappointment. Not that it's a bad featurette, but compared to other \\"Making of\\"-featurettes from Disney DVD's, \\"Making of a Princess\\" feels rather slight in many ways and could've been more informative in some parts.<br /><br />The other featurettes comes off as bigger disappointments, since the blu ray includes several videos that have already been released on the Internet. Some of them are a little informative, while others are pure promotional. But still, they've already been released on the Internet and in this new YouTube-era, those featurettes would be easy to find on YouTube and just exists as to refill the blu ray-edition. With a heavily promoted and successful movie (although it took a while for it cross 100 $), couldn't Disney have made more interesting featurettes?<br /><br />OVERALL REVIEW<br />\\"The Princess and the Frog\\" proves that Disney is still capable of making enchanting and captivating features. Although this isn't Disney's very best film, it's still a entertaining and heartfelt movie for families to enjoy. Although both the DVD and blu ray edition are surprisingly light on bonus material, I still give the Combo Pack Edition four of five stars, mostly because of the movie itself.<br />Now my only wish is that Disney will continue making good-quality hand drawn animation again.uence \\"Dig A Little Deeper\\", along with the director's commentary.

B000002GKT|5.0|For me, this is the best live rock recording ever. The whole band and the audience are fantastic. Steve Marriot is at his absolute best here.  Only few live albums can compare to this masterpiece in musicianship and atmosphere, like ABB-Live at Fillmore East, Colosseum-Live 1971, Deep Purple-Live in Japan, LZ-Song Remains The Same, Frank Zappa-In New York.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|in a world of hyped up releases that dont live up to expectations this is the real deal. could it have been longer and more comprehensive ? of course- but every song on this set is killer. if you are only going to own one neil young cd- this should be it....
B0013N4AT0|4.0|I bought this album just the other day, the album is so far my favorite by opeth beating out all the others i own (orchid, damnation, watershed, deliverance (that was is great to!)) I have no complaints about the music but i bought it because i thought wow a dvd AND a cd what a great buy! I didnt think i would be a cd and another cd that just shows a picture. It may be in 5.1 surround sound or whatever but its just a picture with music to me, certainly not the dvd i was expecting. So its not all negative this is an album worthy of the money and it does have one live performance so thats pretty alright, Go buy this one if you have any interest in the band!
0061703257|5.0|I had not seen this movie prior to reading the book and I highly suggest you do the same. It will give you such a greater insight and understanding of the characters and their background. This book is a real pager turner. Normally I just read when I'm bored or when I'm lying in bed trying to get sleepy. With this book I found myself addicted, reading it every opportunity I got at work or whereever.<br /><br />The characters are so real and you felt like you were right there witnessing the whole thing. Typically I can figure how a book is going to end, but with this book I was completely fooled. Lehane did an awesome job telling a great story.
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|There are already a couple of lengthy reviews so I'll keep this brief.    If you are new to Evangelion:    I suggest watching the original series first ([[ASIN:B000VLL0O8 Neon Genesis Evangelion Platinum: Perfect Collection]]), substituting \\"[[ASIN:B000068OJ1 Neon Genesis Evangelion - The End Of Evangelion]]\\" for the final two episodes. Evangelion 1.11 is essentially taking the first 6 episodes of NGE (150+ minutes of storytelling) and fitting it into slightly over an hour and a half. To the new viewer, the story in Evangelion 1.11 may seem rushed. To me it seems to focus more on how bad-ass it is when giant, bio-engineered cyborg/beings fight against giant, celestial beings whilst smashing to pieces the surrounding cityscape ... because it is really, really cool.    If you are already an Evangelion fan:    Why haven't you already bought this!? Even though this focuses more on action, there are several spots (plot-wise) where I like what is done in Evangelion 1:11 more than the series. There are even a couple of 'a-ha!' moments as well. The story is pretty faithful to the first 6 episodes of the series with the exception of the end (no spoilers!) when we are left believing the story will start varying more from the original. For the English dub, the voices of Misato and Shinji seem exactly the same; Rei sounds the same except not quite as 'whispery' and sad; Ritsuko is slightly different but familiar; Gendo is completely different. Gendo's \\"new voice\\" is a lot less cold. I almost feel like it makes his character a little more complex because he doesn't come across as such a complete ass*. That being said... I kinda miss the \\"old voice\\". Kensuke and Toji sound different as well. As far as visual presentation goes, Evangelion 1.11 is an ocular orgasm. I had this cheesy otaku grin on my face the whole way through - you know the one I'm talking about! Maybe some slight drooling as well. Eh, let's face it; the drooling started as soon as I picked this up at the store. Mygirlfriend can attest to this since she had to drive home from the mall so I could flip through the included booklet. Speaking of the booklet, special features are plentiful, though not completely amazing. The packaging is pretty damn cool, however... Oooo, shiny!    Okay, I'm done now so you can click \\"Add to Cart\\".
0307454541|4.0|This was certainly not the best book I have read this year, but it was good enough for me to buy the second book in the trilogy. If you personally knew me that should tell you enough right there about this book.<br /><br />I had heard a lot of people talking about how great this book was so I bought the kindle version for my iphone. I don't feel it was as great as everyone said it was, but I definitely enjoyed the time I spent reading it.  The ending seemed very exciting and the author did a great job tying all the loose ends together at the end. The characters were beleivable for the most part, though there were a couple of instances I thought were a bit over the top.<br /><br />This is a good book, not five stars, but I think it is worth the money and I beleive you will have an enjoyable time reading it.
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|I've been a student of Tudor history, and especially the tragedy of Anne Boleyn, whose story has always fascinated me,  for about forty years.  I saw the movie after reading Ms. Gregory's book, itself a wildly speculative work of loosely based historical fiction - emphasis on fiction.  The movie is even worse, from an historical accuracy perspective.  Mary Boleyn was anything but the shrinking violet and dutiful little daughter she is portrayed to be; what little can be found of her in historical accounts indicates that she was sent home in disgrace from the French court for promiscuity.  She was married to Will Carey right after her fling with Henry, and if the child she bore was in fact the King's, he did not acknowledge it so.  Anne spent several years at the French court, not just a couple of months, and not because she was sent there as punishment; when she joined the English court, she introduced many French trends, a sharp contrast to Queen Katharine's Spanish ways.  Nor was she as young as Natalie Portman plays her; she was at least thirty when Elizabeth was born, and somewhere around 36 when she died.  Henry, as portrayed by Eric Bana, was anything but the still young, still slim, still handsome sex symbol he is shown to be, and he was red-haired, to boot.  George Boleyn was anything but the scared little boy he is made out to be; although compelled to marry Jane Parker, he was actually the life of the court, quite a womanizer and gambler, and the center of a group of courtiers who were the King's, and Anne's, friends and constant companions.  Rather than being the only man sent to the block for adultery with Anne, George was only one of five men accused and executed.  Jane Parker recanted her testimony regarding the siblings' incest, which sent her husband to his death, at her own execution in 1542.  The sisters did not take turns competing for Henry, nor did they take turns playing serving maid to each other while the other slept with the King.  Mary was,in fact, banished from court, never to return, when she secretly married William Stafford.  There is no record of her attempting to intercede with the King on Anne's behalf, and she certainly did not carry Elizabeth away with her to raise; Elizabeth at the time of her mother's death was established in her own household, with servants, nurses, and governesses, and at some remove from court, an arrangement that did not change for several years.   Norfolk, while the malignant mover and shaker behind pimping out the Boleyn and Howard girls, was not the person who destroyed Anne's relationship with Henry Percy; that was done by Cardinal Wolsey, at the King's instigation.      I could go on, but before taking this film seriously, read  [[ASIN:0345453212 The Lady in the Tower: The Fall of Anne Boleyn]] by Alison Weir, a meticulously researched documentary written by a recognized contemporary historian.    On the positive side, the costumes are spectacular.
B002ZG983M|2.0|At the start of \\"Kick-Ass,\\" I couldn't help but feel somewhat excited, as I was introduced to the title character, who, when not dressed as a superhero, I found both engaging and amusing. While his thought process is not something I pretend to understand, the situations he finds himself in as a typical high schooler were somewhat relatable, and they got a chuckle or two out of me. But then we meet eleven-year-old Mindy Macready (Chloë Grace Moretz) and her father (Nicholas Cage); they stand in an empty lot, her wearing a bulletproof vest, him pointing a gun at her, all in an effort to train her as a crime fighter. He fires his gun, and that's when the movie stopped being funny for me. But it isn't until she kills someone that I finally realized how deplorable it was.    A killjoy, am I? You'll forgive if I'm not entertained by the sight of a kid murdering people, or of a kid being beaten within an inch of her life by big, mean men with guns. And I'm even less thrilled with the idea of a father training his child to be a ruthless vigilante, as if he were doing no more than showing her how to ride a bike. Yes, I know it's all done stylistically, that it doesn't represent reality, that the whole thing is supposed to be a satire on society and violence and today's internet culture, and yadda yadda yadda. But there does come a point when enough is enough. If I'm failing to see the genius in \\"Kick-Ass,\\" that's fine by me, because I truly don't want to understand or even inhabit a world where underage carnage qualifies as something to be laughed at.    But before I go too far with this, let me take a moment to discuss the film's first ten minutes, at which point I still had hope it would work. We meet teenager Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), an unremarkable comic book reader who notes that, while just about everyone tries to be like their favorite celebrity, few try to be like a superhero. Of course, no one could ever be Superman, for he possesses extraterrestrial powers that exist only in the imagination - the ability to fly, superhuman strength, x-ray vision, etc. But what about someone like Batman, who has no superpowers? True, he's ultra rich and has access to high tech equipment, but he's still fallible. When Dave is mugged and a bystander fails to intervene, he decides to stop wondering and start acting; he dons a mail order green scuba suit and mask and adopts the alter ego Kick-Ass, New York's newest crime fighter.    His attempts at preventing any kind of crime are disastrous, although he quickly becomes a sensation thanks to websites like YouTube and Myspace. This, I can buy: In Western society, anyone can have a taste of fame, even if that person happens to be incredibly untalented. But that's where the satire stops. In due time, Dave crosses paths with Mindy and her father, who dress in flashy superhero suits have adopted the monikers Hit Girl and Big Daddy; both are so skilled at what they do that they seem like ... I was going to say genuine superheroes, but that isn't quite true since all the good ones have never resorted to shooting, stabbing, or throat slitting. However, their knowledge of martial arts is second to none, and so is their ability to jump across long distances and off tall buildings. In other words, they don't seem like ordinary people trying to be superheroes, so the film's premise is now null and void.    There's also a subplot involving Big Daddy's target: Crime boss Frank D'Amico (Erik Strong), whose son (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), somehow ends up as a patsy named Red Mist, created with the sole intent of luring in Kick-Ass and taking him down. All this could have been halfway entertaining if only it weren't so intertwined with the story of Hit Girl, who at one point finds herself running down a hallway in slow motion, singlehandedly blowing away an entire squad of well-armed hitmen in a blaze of bullets and blood. Had this not involved an eleven-year-old, I might have gotten into the scene's choreography, which, I must admit, is quite impressive. Alas, I'm watching a girl who hasn't even entered puberty relentlessly killing people, something I wouldn't even want to try to enjoy.    If this truly is an accurate commentary on today's media-obsessed youth culture, and if we're still at a point when mass audiences find this kind of stuff entertaining, then I'm sorry to say we still have a long, long way to go. Under no circumstances should we be laughing at extreme comic book violence involving children, not at a time when we're saturated with news stories about youth gangs and classroom shootings. \\"Kick-Ass\\" is a grave miscalculation, not only because of its content, but also because of the belief that it's a harmless, escapist action film. The more I think about the audiences that laughed from beginning to end, the sadder I get. Is it no longer fun to watch kids being ... well, kids?
B002VPE1B6|3.0|That I am not forced to pay $30 for!! Sure If I want the special addition I will wait just like for the LOTR trilogy. But truthfully this movie is not worth that wait. It was great in IMAX 3D but most of that specticle is gone here in the home. Not all but most , this is not a movie with a great story. Entertaining yes for sure and I do think its worth a watch from everyone.
0321525655|5.0|A great book that reminds every would-be presenter to keep it simple (stupid).  Lots of real-world examples.  If you have to give a presentation this is required reading.<br /><br />Having said that, it does not address handouts in detail (nor should it).  Pages 66-67 are dedicated to basic dos and don'ts on handouts, but you'll need to look elsewhere for advice on that aspect.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Am I the only one that was watching this movie saying...man I've seen this story before...then it hit me...Fern Gully: the last rainforest! But I liked Fern Gully more. This is the best looking 3d movie I have seen on blu ray with humans.  5 stars
1932100660|5.0|Having just completed reading this book, I'm now determined to maintain my recent elimination of red meat and poultry from my regular diet and will now attempt taking the next step towards vegan based purely on health motives.    The book tackles cancer, heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease, MS, and various other \\"diseases of affluence\\" in each case working to illustrate how the same diet can prevent and possibly reverse the disease.  A combination of population surveys and biological studies work to show that the key to a healthy body free of those diseases of affluence is: Whole foods, plant-based diet.    Halfway through the book, you may start to think \\"OK OK I get it, I give in.. no more meat and dairy...\\"... But don't give up reading  just yet, because I found the final Part most intriguing as Dr. Campbell answers the inevitable question of why haven't we heard this advice from our medical and government authorities.  Dr. Campbell goes into detail about the conflict of interest at the highest levels without shying away from exposing names.  As you read the final part, you may not help but feel a sense of anger and rage towards the institutions that we are entrusting to protect us.

B000W7JWUA|4.0|Explaining the greatness of Settlers would be a whole review unto itself- Amazon provides an excellent description, and it's easier to say that if you regularly play board games with about four people (more through expansions), this is one of the best games you can buy. Catan is one of the kings of \\"Eurogames\\"- games entirely about the social aspect and mechanics of gaming, instead of the game's flavor or setting. It appeals to an audience that spans ages and cultures and generations, and you need to own it today.<br /><br />The problem with this particular version is in the build quality, especially along the island borders. The borders are printed in too-light and too-easily-warped thin cardboard, or thick cardstock. They are supposed to interlock like jigsaw pieces, but due to the flimsy printing, they easily come apart. This quickly becomes an issue during setup, when you lay the hexes inside the border and it takes some help from everyone at the table to get things to line up decently. And if your table or tablecloth is anything less than perfectly flat, it's impossible to get things to fit exactly, and tiles may slip under the border if anyone jostles the setup.<br /><br />So it's still an extremely fun game, and well worth playing. Much like playing chess on a cardboard dollar-store board versus playing it on a real board, there's quite a difference in the quality of play when you aim for higher-quality materials. I'd still recommend this version if it's the only one you can afford, or the only one you can get your hands on, but if you're already a fan and you want a board you can really put some miles on, I'd look elsewhere.
B00337KM2S|5.0|My husband I enjoyed this film.  It was very entertaining and not at all predicatable.  It is nice to see a film for adults.  The acting was fantastic.  I hope to see more of Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick in the future.  Of course Jason Bateman is always good and I am glad to see him in more films.  George Clooney was fantastic too.  The scene at the end where he stands there and says nothing but watching his facial expressions change was superb acting.  Using out of work people in the scenes was genious.  Jason Reitman is a great director and look forward to his next project.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|This movie is excellent.  I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter Saga and I have all the movies.  This is an amazing, sad movie.  Wow!!!!
0307454541|4.0|Having seen copies of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, or it's squeal The Girl Who Plays with Fire everywhere in the past few weeks i decided I needed to check it out. It's an intriguing set of mysteries. The books original Swedish title translated to Men Who Hate Women, and that theme is ever present through the book in the mysteries that Mikael and Lisbeth are trying to solve.<br /><br />In the beginning it seems like there is far to much story to cover. There's the libel case that Blomkivist has just lost against the corporate giant Wennerstrom, there is Harriet Vanger who is dead or missing and comes from a dysfunctional family that also happens to own a large business, and there is Salander who is always distant and defiant. I'm  impressed at how Larsson connected all of these stories and made them into something worth reading. Some parts could drag, and if I had to read about how Blomkivist didn't think he could solve this case one more time I may have set the book down, never to finish.<br /><br />The Vanger family is very interesting. It's a huge family (with a small family tree in the front of the book) and everyone has secrets. I had a hard time trusting any of them throughout, not even Henrik Vanger, the lovable old man who has brought in Blomkivist. Henrik's obsessive nature makes him someone you need to watch. The fact that Blomkivist agrees to work for him shows of his trusting nature, and makes him the biggest contrast for the interdependent Salander.
0545123267|5.0|Wow! I loved this book. I'm not usually the biggest fan of werewolf stories, but this one hooked me in. I am also not usually the biggest fan of the device where we get one chapter from one character's point of view and the next from the other main character's, but again, it really worked here. This was so very romantic. Some of what I have felt was missing from the YA romance are the scenes of the 2 main characters together - so that we can feel their relationship develop. This had that, it was a nice change. The writing was romantic, but not mushy. I felt that we got enough depth on characters - even ones we hadn't really met yet (like Beck) that when we did meet them, I felt like like I already knew them. It was a unique look at the werewolf myth too - just enough common from other stories to make it interesting and enough different to give me something to route for. It totally made me cry towards the end - and I haven't had a book make me cry in a while. I couldn't put this one down - started Sunday morning and finished Sunday night.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|oprah is a miserable narrator.  I tried watching this in hd on tv, and personally feel ordering this version would be a complete waste of money.  I have the Planet Earth in blu-ray narrated by david, and its still one of my favorite additions to my BR collection. I already have BBC's version of life pre-ordered and would suggest you do as well.  David  just has a way with his voice that can draw me into the show and relax me. Plus the added benefit that each section is on average 13 minutes longer than this version.<br /><br />In my opinion the Oprah version just seems like she wanted to narrate the series and no one at discovery had the manhood to tell the self proclaimed queen no.
B001S33D1G|3.0|Not one of my favorite Gaiman outings.... started out feeling like I was reading one of those old \\"Dick and Jane\\" books... you know: Jane has brown hair. See Jane run. Jane likes toys.... it got better towards the end, but the writing felt very basic. The story itself was interesting though. I can see why they turned it into a movie. It took all of about 90 minutes to read, so it's quick and cute if you have 90 minutes to kill. But I would prefer to re-read Stardust if given the choice between the two.  There were also a few plot points that left me scratching my head at the end too.  The characters were as colorful as they can be in a \\"Dick and Jane\\" sort of way.  It was a little too creepy to for me to feel like this should be in the children's section of my bookstore where I found it.  YA or Fantasy seems more appropriate.  I think kids my end up scared out of their wits reading this.
B002CVQAX6|5.0|I have watched this movie so many times since I was about eleven. Well now being nineteen I found this here on Amazon in blu-ray. I just got it today and will be watching it shortly. I have yet to see this movie in blu-ray so mind you when I found this on here in blu-ray I was very excited, having an hd-tv and ps3 now I can watch one of my all-time favorite movies in hd. It's worth the almost twelve dollars if you have a blu-ray player, a very good movie if you like semi-scary, unexpected scenes.    Now the movie itself is really good. It's about ship salvagers who end up hired by a man to bring in a ship. I'm not going to give away the story, so if you want more you should buy it. The whole story is them on the ship and is very interesting. Has a very good story line, not extremely scary, but unexpected scenes happen quite often, and there are jumpy factors in the movie.    Hopefully this helps, I thought it was a great movie and I hope many agree with me.
B003DRWX9I|4.0|I have to say i was skeptical going in, but this is a good, solid, rockin fun effort from slash and his cohorts, i espically like the fergie, kid rock, the instrumental, and the iggy pop songs in particular.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|So many bands have a great first album and then each album after that gets progressively worse. This is not the case with Rise Against. Quite the opposite, in fact. They started out as poor song writers and developed with each passing album. This particular album may be the pinnicle of their career. This album features great lyrics, melodies, and guitar riffs.
1596177373|5.0|Tim Burton's book \\"The Melkancholy Death of Oyster Boy and Other Stories\\" and the range of \\"Tragic Toys\\" derived from it demonstrate the wider imagination that make his feature films so unique.  This item is rather simple - it is a deck of playing cards with a typically carnivalesque burton reverse on all cards with Burton's \\"Melancholy\\" characters - such as Toxic Boy, the Pin Cushion Queen and all, used as the character cards. The number cards are not neglected though, with the hearts,spades, clubs and diamonds scratched out and couloured in his distinctive illustrative style.  This is fun and a must for Burton completists.
0061703087|5.0|This is Critchon's best book since Jurasic Park. The beginning is really interesting as it follows a house dad who struggles to find trust in his wife who works all the time. As a father to a young child, the scene where the baby gets the rash was rather disturbing because he described it so well (i started dreaming that happened to my kid). When the main character enters the work force, that is where the action really picks up. In this book, they fight an enemy that seems unstoppable. This book was excellent. My only gripe is that it wrapped up quickly in the end. It also didn't show a lot of after math, which always disappoints me.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|Excellent movie!  It isn't worth waiting until November to get the bonus footage.  By that time, several other great movies will have been released on blu-ray.  I really want to get this movie home, watch it on my theater, and load it onto my iphone.  I agree with people not wanting to be double dipped, so just don't buy the November release.  This movie has a lot of dialogue and 99% of deleted scenes in movies need to stay deleted(we had to wait 20+ years for Star Wars added scenes that were awful!).  Watch the bonus features on utube, and instead buy one of the summer movies that will be hitting shelves on blu-ray around November.  Unlike LOTR, which we have all seen and purchased a million times, I don't want to wait for this release.  I still hope that everyone does stand firm on not buying decade old movies 2x-4x on blu-ray, after we have already bought them multiple times on dvd and vhs. The quality of this movie is incredible and the deleted scene that got leaked onto the internet last month was total overboard crap.  Don't hesitate to buy this one.
B0006Z2LH4|3.0|I bought all three Cube DVDs for a bargain and, having watched Cube and Hypercube first, I didn't expect much of this one.

B000WEMH3C|1.0|It's a great cover if you live somewhere that has no wind.  It's not fun having to fetch your cover from your neighbors yard every time the wind picks up a little.  I even tried using a bungee cord to cinch it down but the thin material just tore the next time the wind picked up.
B002QQ8HAG|5.0|I have now watched this film several times on pay-for-view, because I find the details about operation of the fashion industry absolutely fascinating.  Although the documentary centers around the production of the September issue of Vogue, with the \\"human\\" element provided by the different styles and working relationship of the editor, Anna Wintour, and creative director, Grace Coddington, what we really see in this film is how fashion works and styles are made.  The designers design, but are also influenced by the business interests, represented in the film by Anna, the Conde Nast publishers, the Gap and the President of Neiman Marcus (who wants his deliveries on time!).  Moreover, as Grace Coddington, the artist, says -- if the magazine (and clothing) doesn't sell, the artists will have no place to practice their art.  So business and art go hand-in-hand to create Vogue, and the marriage isn't always an easy one.<br /><br />The magazine is built, literally photo by photo, on photo \\"boards.\\"  As editor, Wintour must keep the whole issue in mind, balancing stories, developing themes, and instructing the stylists who go out on shoots.  In addition, with the help of her editors, Wintour must keep her eye out for new designers and fashion trends.  It's a multi-billion dollar business, reflected in a few hundred pages of editorial work and advertisements.  Yet at the same time, fashion is sociology, psychology and art.  The editor knows this, which is why she excels at her job.<br /><br />Many reviewers have commented that \\"human\\" side of Wintour comes through in this documentary.  Yet, disappointed assistants aside (and you know what -- it was one of the best jobs in the world -- what was her problem?), I've always believed that Wintour's demeanor and attitudes are no more harsh than that of any top executive running a successful, mega-dollar corporation.  In that respect, fashion is no different than auto production; the executive has to wear many hats and always consider the bottom line.  Wintour is running the top fashion magazine in the world; she'd be an idiot (which she surely is not) if she did not strategize and play tough.<br /><br />The big surprise in the film, however, and the Vogue editor who steals the show is, of course, Grace Coddington.  I have to say that I had never heard of Grace.  Yet I see that, if Wintour is the heart of Vogue, Coddington is the soul.  I agree with Wintour; Grace is a genius.  She comes across as a true artist: sensitive, warm, open, testy and rude at times, angry when her vision is not appreciated; yet endlessly creative and very beautiful.  I loved her untamed red hair, long black dresses or pants, and sandals.  While I'd expected that Cutler's film would be fun and and informative, Grace was a treasure that I hadn't anticipated.<br /><br />So I've now ordered the DVD (but from B&N, not Amazon -- I wanted the extra DVD).

B001UV4XWY|5.0|To understand the Box, one can either watch it again on DVD with subtitles on, or read my cliff notes below.  I try to summarize it without giving away much details, which you the reader probably already know if you are reading this.    The moral choice, that Norma and Arthur face, has been the focus of much discussion and debate.  Although it drives the narrative, it is merely the movie's starting point.  The meat of the Box (also a sensible departure from Richard Matheson's short story) is the carefully raised possibility of aliens taking over major US government agencies (NSA, NASA, FBI and etc.) and conducting social experiment on humans to determine its viability as a species.  This is the larger context which the story takes place in.  It causes much confusion in the audience.  It is however integral to an appreciation of Richard Kelly's intriguing work.    At the start of the film, US is close to finding evidence of life on Mars.  Arthur himself works on the space program.  The aliens (Martians?) sends one of its agents to inhabit the body of researcher Arlington Steward after lightning'd struck him.  Alien Steward conducts a social experiment, the purpose of which is to determine whether human individuals are capable of putting aside their personal desires to do the \\"right\\" things.  Logic follows that if they can, humans as a species have a chance for survival.  If not, humans may be selected for extermination (before they reach Mars?).  Aliens are able to co-opt local and central US government agencies.  They after all would not be able to openly conduct their businesses without them.  It is unclear whether agency heads are willing subjects or not.  Aliens have the technology to do it either way.  They can rewire human brains with a slight side effect of nose bleed.  It is helpful to be reminded of the much cited Arthur C Clark's third law \\"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\\"    I would comment on the library scene where Arthur is asked to select \\"salvation\\" and \\"damnation.\\"  It may seem a digression, as an earlier reviewer suggested.  It is not.  It provides the motivation for Arthur's final decision and more.  His belief in reuniting with Norma in afterlife allows him to perform his final act.  What is even more interesting is whether or not Arthur really saw afterlife or that he just thinks that he did.  Aliens have the \\"water and light based\\" technology to make subjects to see whatever aliens want them to see.  Aliens' \\"employees\\" are similar to the hypnotized acting with little self awareness.  It is very likely that aliens tricked Arthur into seeing life after death because they were preparing Arthur as a victim in the next round of test.  Similarly, Alien Steward suggests Sartre's Existentialism to Norma.  Both theology and philosophy are hollow ideologies to aliens.  They are merely two more tools for Alien Steward to manipulate the experiment subjects.    The Box is not a straight thriller like the Eagle Eye (2008).  It is a cerebral experience that challenges our sense of reality, the like which can be found in quasi science fictions of Philip K Dick, Kurt Vonnegut and Thomas Pynchon.  It demands a second viewing with subtitles.  I hope that the review helps.
0316066524|5.0|Jesus, what a ride. Here is a book. A big, painful, specific, beautiful, repulsive, manically-paced yet excruciatingly complex book. The plot is Tennis and Drugs and Entertainment. It deals with addictions of all forms (and includes two vile nighttime rape scenes) and dead babies and Demerol and long  long descriptions and philosophy and madness. Plus one amazing street-fight! Just brilliant street-fight! Tear-inducing street fight. And two dudes talking on a hill, and a big bell jar full of bugs and a mysterious drug called DMZ and LOTS OF PLOT POINTS THAT DO NOT GET RESOLVED. It is not a linguistic deconstruction like Ulysses and is therefore 100% more approachable (never mind the footnotes). There is a lot of humor here, as well as a LOT of heartbreakingly intense drug-stuff and ugly, ugly human beings. It is not for the faint of heart, or those of us expecting a ton of reveals at the end. It is a massively-inflated amalgam of Confederacy of Dunces, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Gravity's Rainbow, etc. IT is Vonnegut for the new century, albeit a lot more grandiose. It is streaming in a million directions at once, lyrical, poised, breathtaking and headlong. It is a runaway rocket ship of a book, throughout the course you're riding it you might get tired, confused, agitated, queasy, feel ADDICTED TO IT SHAMELESSLY. I have been neglecting my life for it, my friends, my girlfriend, my homework. I read it feverishly, 100 pages+ a day, while trying to keep up my normal routine. It is exhausting once it hooks you. Whew. What a ride. I'm still reeling. On the upside, if you finish, other books with seem like child's play. But we warned, the ending might leave you feeling empty inside, as though a jet-engine propelled slug beast went shimmying through your skull, igniting every synapse in a kind of blistering, immensely illuminating light, but once it is gone you feel simply
B0026J8LHM|1.0|Everytime i listen to a DT song, it makes me feel like i'm listening to a bunch over extended rehashed riffs from the 80's with some bad metallica riffs thrown in combined with over done vocals that dont mix well with the overall nature of each song. Dream theater is a mess all the way around as they constantly fail to keep a consistent character to each song in to make it their signature. Pretty much the band revolves around John Petrucci's narcisistic guitar playing of him showing off how on key he can get his solo's  to be but, the problem there is that he never dares to get messy which is what all the great guitar players do. He just confines himself within a scale envelope that sounds more like a music theory lesson.   Dream theater lacks the musical character as whole to be anywhere near as good as Pink floyd, Rush, or Emerson Lake and Palmer for that matter.  Their music isnt progressive since it isnt original, its just a bunch of styles mixed together. Seems more like a lesson on how to put together varying styles into one song therefore their music should be reclassed into the band lesson territory
0006480101|3.0|If you liked Assassin's Apprentice, chances are you will read this one too.  I found the story good, but not great, and the telling of it wore on longer than it should. Too predictable, and lacking the perspective that distinguishes other novels in the genre.
1584282584|5.0|I have been a long time reader of Neil's blog, and wanted to purchase the book to both further my photographic education, and support someone who has taught me so much already.  The blog is excellent, incase you have never seen it, and the book is definitely up to that standard.    It is extremely well presented and the layout is beautiful and just 'makes sense'.  You will find a wealth of information in there - from bouncing your flash on camera, to off camera flash and lighting techniques.    One thing I did notice is, you don't feel rushed when you flip the pages.  You really get the chance to examine his images and work, learn some new techniques, and adapt that work to your own style.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who doesn't know what bouncing their flash is or does - up to someone who is a seasoned pro and wants to look at some beautiful pictures.    Thanks Neil!
0307269981|2.0|#2 Millenium trilogy featuring Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist. Salander returns home from her year-long sabbatical away from Sweden, settles into a new home and tries to figure out what to do with her life. She hasn't seen or spoken to any of her acquaintances since returning, but when she hacks into Blomkvist's computer to see what he's up to, she's stunned to see that he and his colleagues are working on an expos&eacute; of the sex trade in Sweden, specifically in importing penniless young girls in from foreign countries to essentially become slaves. She gathers some information and goes to see the young couple who are working specifically on the issue and the couple ends up brutally murdered just after she's there.<br /><br />Blomkvist, who had called them to say he'd drop by some paperwork that was needed, discovers the bodies. When Salander's fingerprints are discovered on the weapon and her guardian is also found dead, she becomes the victim of a frantic witch hunt with painful details of her past splashed all over the papers--but for some reason, no one including the police, the prosecutor, or the newspapers has any information about the most important incident of all, the thing she calls \\"All The Evil\\" which occurred around her thirteenth birthday. Blomkvist and his team try to solve the murders of their co-workers independently of the police, as he does not believe Lisbeth is guilty.<br /><br />Ok. I'm going to say right now that it took me weeks to read this book. I give the author an A for the storyline and plot, but the execution of the idea was, in my opinion, rather poorly done. The book seriously needed editing--it was way too long with way too many insignificant tangents and details about minor characters that were totally unnecessary and irrelevant. The writing style itself was very uneven--sometimes I was captivated and sucked into the story, but then a few pages later I had trouble concentrating because the writing had changed to superficial claptrap--for example, when Salander was furnishing her new home, there were three pages of prose listing the furniture (including brand names from Ikea) and the decor, yet when I was done reading that passage, I had no sense at all of what the place really looked like.<br /><br />It was almost like there were two people writing. There was also the dichotomy with the characters--Salander was fascinating to me, but Blomkvist was dead boring. I also had to wonder why, with the supposedly wonderful medical care Sweden has, no one even whispered the term \\"Aspberger's Syndrome\\" in connection with Salander. I'm not a professional, and yet it was fairly clear to me that she likely had some form of that malady.<br /><br />I've decided I'm not going to torture myself and read the third one. I know a lot of people loved this book, and when I had such an opposing reaction, I really did take some time to figure out if this is just me being contrary (as I have been known to be on occasion!) or if I had some valid criticism. I think my criticism is valid. The whole idea and the story was a superb idea, but in my mind it was just poorly brought to life. This was not a book I couldn't put down, this was a book I HAD to put down and read in small bits in order to finish it. I can't help but wonder if the author had lived if the editing done would have been better. I guess we'll never know.ple, when Salander was furnishing her new home, there were three pages of prose listing the furniture (including brand names from Ikea) and the decor, yet when I was done reading that passage, I had no sense at all of what the place really looked like.

I'm not a professional, and yet it was fairly clear to me that she likely had some form of that malady.     I've decided I'm not going to torture myself and read the third one. I know a lot of people loved this book, and when I had such an opposing reaction, I really did take some time to figure out if this is just me being contrary (as I have been known to be on occasion!) or if I had some valid criticism. I think my criticism is valid. The whole idea and the story was a superb idea, but in my mind it was just poorly brought to life. This was not a book I couldn't put down, this was a book I HAD to put down and read in small bits in order to finish it. I can't help but wonder if the author had lived if the editing done would have been better. I guess we'll never know.
B00005JKNF|2.0|This is a talky, overrated film that left me cold. The production values and all-star cast seemed to guarantee a good time, but the story itself (and the performances) is so flat and uninteresting that I had a hard time staying awake. This is one of those British dramas in which fancy production values and dignified performances are supposed to make up for the lack of real drama. I can see by other viewer's responses that the film is meant to be subtle. Well, subtlety shouldn't mean deadness. I was bored out of my mind. At first I thought it was me - I watched it once, then watched it a second time to see if it was just me. Like a dead fish, the film just lay there. After seeing 55 negative reviews, I realize I'm not alone - if you want to see a truly entertaining film about similiar subjects, check out \\"The Remains of the Day\\" - the big difference is that \\"Day\\" has artistic passion lurking underneath the stylish veneer (no doubt due to the presence of that brillant thespian, Anthony Hopkins), and this film just doesn't.
B0024FADAQ|4.0|Lance Guest and Dan O'Herlihy star in this 1984 sci-fi film.   A videogame fanatic is chosen to save the galaxy for real.  This is a great film and this 25th anniversary dvd has nice   picture and sound plus neat extras. I recommend this 80's  classic.
B00081MUY0|5.0|One of the things that sticks out in my mind about this album is the circumstances hearing it in full 4-D.  A friend of mine discovered morning glory seeds as having some psychotropic properties, so a bunch of people proceeded to grind up 320 seeds each (Heavenly Blues or Pearly Gates) in a pepper mill (because the hulls are very hard and will not be digested unless ground) and after 20 or 30 minutes, the world began to shift. We placed the album \\"Sunshine Superman\\" on the stereo and let it play.. over and over, all afternoon, until it was time to go see Jay and the Americans at the Va. Tech concert hall. (I'm guessing 1968 or 69).    The men who moved the piano onto the stage received a standing ovation from several of us.
B00262T4YS|4.0|Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen star in John Carpenter's  1984 sci-fi film. A stranded alien seeks a Wisconsin   widow's help to get home. This is a great film and   Jeff is amazing in this. This dvd has good picture   and sound, but only a trailer. I highly recommend  this 80's classic.

I like that Jamie Lee came back,  but I wish Donald Pleasence could've been in it too.   This dvd has good picture and sound plus a couple   neat extras. I recommend this good sequel.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Sure this is very similar to Dances With Wolves set in a world drawn by Roger Dean(the Yes album covers.)But Avatar is the shortest 3 hour movie ever. I could have sat through another hour easily. As beautiful as this alien world is, the lesson from this story seems to be that going to alien worlds will bring nothing but trouble. Obviously when a military organization is working for a corporation then ethical decisions will be scarce. Hopefully, if we ever do achieve interstellar travel, corporations will be a thing of the past.

B0000CNY27|5.0|Kurt Russell and Lee Van Cleef star in John Carpenter's 1981 action film. A war criminal is sent to rescue a  kidnapped President. This is one of Carpenter & Russell's best with a great cast, Russell is terrific  as Snake Plissken and Carpenter & Alan Howarth's  score is excellent as usual. This blu-ray features  nice picture and sound plus neat extras. Definitely get this classic.
B00005UOXN|5.0|The best collection of remixes I've ever had.  Of course I'm a Billy Idol fan, and I know remixes can sometimes be pathetic but this CD is full of great ones.  Billy Idol has energy but these remixes seem to find a way to shoot these songs with 100ccs of adrenaline.  Great for Idol veterans and new-comers.
B008MU8ZNO|4.0|Grant Cramer, Suzanne Snyder, John Allen Nelson and John Vernon<br />star in this 1988 sci-fi/horror film. A town is terrorized by vicious<br />alien clowns. I grew up watching this and always liked it. I've<br />always been creeped out by clowns, especially after seeing<br />this film. This blu-ray has nice picture and sound plus neat<br />extras. I recommend this good, campy 80's sci/fi horror flick.

1601251505|5.0|This system is a rebalancing and reworking of the D&D 3.5e system and as such hardly holds any purely original content. Despite that the content it does hold is much better balanced and bit easier to run than the old 3.5 rules it replaces, and as such makes a very good RPG system. The main quality it holds above 3.5e is the fact that it makes it worthwhile to level most classes to the end (20th level) rather than multi-classing, but makes multi-classing easier to figure out in case you decide to anyway.<br /><br />The quality of the book itself is very good, being a sturdy hardcover that has beautiful full-color pages and wonderful artwork throughout.<br /><br />Note that you should only buy the book if you want a physical copy of the rules, the rules themselves are available online at[..]. That said, I do recommend buying the book as having a physical copy is much easier to use in a pen & paper RPG context than the online versions, which I consider more of a backup. That and the online version doesn't have the shiny artwork, but I'm easily distracted :)
B001B1UO6W|4.0|Catherine Hicks, Chris Sarandon and Brad Dourif star<br />in this 1988 horror film. A boy gets a doll for his<br />birthday that's possessed by a killer's soul.

B000002L7Y|4.0|A-ha's debut album, \\"Hunting High and Low\\", is 80's dance pop music at its best.  While it has some slow moments, the album as a whole acted as an extremely successful boost into stardom for the Norwegian artists.  The band uses digital synthesizers and prosthetic drum tones along with funky bass grooves and melodic guitar lines to create a listener-friendly, exciting sound.  Combined with innovative music videos, a-ha was bound to blast off to stardom.  That is exactly what they did, as their single, \\"Take On Me\\" reached the number one slot in thirty-six countries, and has sold over nine million copies.       The album opens with the debut single, \\"Take On Me\\".  This is the type of song that is still impressive over twenty years after its release.  Its several layers of melodic synthesizer, along with its incredibly catchy chorus make for a nostalgic tune for those who were alive when it was first released, and a fun \\"new\\" song for those hearing it for the first time. It is simply a classic.     The album continues its upbeat, dance-friendly vibe with the second track, \\"Train of Thought\\", which was also one of the album's five total singles.  One of the coolest elements of this track is the super fast bass line, which acts as one of the instrumental leaders, along with a wind instrument, and synthetic strings that provide the basic chord progressions.  The music videos for this track and \\"Take On Me\\" are virtually identical in their attempt to merge animation with real-life actors.  They seem to use this element in most of their music videos, and, while it may have been mind-blowing in 1985, it seems boring that they would keep using the same concept when I watched them in 2010.       The album, however, does have some slow moments.  \\"Hunting High and Low\\" and \\"Living a Boy's Adventure Tale\\" lack the upbeat drive that a-ha were able to capitalize on in their first couple of tracks.  \\"Hunting High and Low\\" was also released as a single, but it did not do nearly as well as a-ha's debut single, \\"Take On Me\\".  These two songs are both slower than most of the rest of the album, and were probably just used in an attempt to woo young teenage girls with Morten Harket's falsetto and strong vibrato.  Whatever their purpose, they simply are not as exciting as the a-ha at its strongest.     The album picks back up with tracks such as \\"The Sun Always Shines On T.V.\\" and \\"I Dream Myself Alive\\".  \\"The Sun Always Shines On T.V.\\" acts as a good transition, because it begins with gentle strings and a soft timbre, but soon enough a heavy drum roll kicks in, and puts the album's pace back into fourth-gear.  \\"I Dream Myself Alive\\", while somewhat repetitive, is a really catchy track, and a-ha puts on an extremely entertaining live show of this song.  Here is the live show they put on for this song Birmingham: [..].  This song is great because it has a darker, more mysterious vibe then the rest of the mostly optimistic-sounding tracks on the album.       A-ha's debut album catapulted them into international fame, and for good reason.  This album is packed with catchy choruses and synthesizer melodies, powerful synthetic drum tones, and funky bass grooves.  This album is certainly a classic 80's album comparable to even Michael Jackson.  While the album does have some slow points, it is an extremely catchy, and upbeat album as a whole, and can be appreciated by any generation of listeners.
B002OHK7CS|5.0|At Last! A show about bikers & the biker lifestyle. Yes, it is violent & a little over inflated, but thats TV...get real. I have been waiting for a show like this for a LONG time. If you like the biker lifestyle, you will love this series.
0882709194|1.0|My grandma insisted on telling me repeatedly that you can't tell a book by its cover.     Darwin's \\"Origin of Species\\" is in here, but the first half of the book is a dubiously sourced propaganda piece designed to cast doubt on the evolutionary theory and boost the creationist myth.  Grandma was right.
8186336141|5.0|Easily one of the most valuable books I have in my possession is \\"Asana Pranayama Mudra Bandha\\" by Swami Satyananda Saraswati. It is a Yoga instruction manual and easily the only one I need. I bought it seven years ago and the more I learn about practicing yoga the more I learn how great this book is. Making up the title of the book are the names of four of the five basic yoga practices; Asana~postures, Pranayama~breathing, Mudra~gestures representing the psyche, Bandha~locks for channeling energy, Shatkarmas~cleansing practices. The book is set up for easy use and has all the key assets that a study manual could have including quick reference and jump-to tabs. Each practice has good concise illustration and instruction leaving no question un-answered and providing a deep education into each practice including charka awareness and corresponding mantras. Perhaps one of my favorite things about this book is the Therapeutic Index beginning on page 525 which lists different ailments of the body and subscribes yoga practices to correct them. It has everything from Menstruation to Cancer. For example; suppose I had a cold or a cough. According to the Therapeutic Index I would want to do the following: Asana~Surya Namaskara (Sun Salutations) and Simhasana (Lion pose). Shatkarma~Neti (nasal cleansing), kunjal (vomiting water), laghoo shankhaprakshalana (short intestinal wash). It also tells me about my diet, that I should avoid mucus-producing foods such as milk and milk products, rice and non-vegetarian foods. I bought this book hoping it would be the only book I would need on the subject of yoga and I feel that I got just that. I find that the most used books are the most loved books in my collection. This is perhaps the most loved book I have.    ~ S.E.
0618918248|3.0|The fact that there are already more than 1500 reviews of this book testifies to its importance and timeliness.  An overview of the reviews also points to an interesting sociologic phenomenon. Reviews written by readers who agree with Dawkins' thesis tend to get a \\"helpful\\" comment, while equally well written reviews who point out fallacies in Dawkins' argument tend more commonly to be regarded as \\"not helpful.\\" This seems to point to a need to have the atheistic point of view validated by a respectable scientist.   This is also the stated purpose of Dawkins book. He wants to \\"raise the consciousness\\" of atheists because, atheism \\"is something to be proud of, standing tall to face far horizons, for atheism nearly always indicates a healthy independence of mind and, indeed, a healthy mind.\\"  While I agree, that one need not be ashamed of atheism but regarding it as a source of pride seems equally unwarranted because we are talking about opinions rather than facts and, in addition, pride is not necessarily a healthy emotion.  The book can be regarded as the equivalent of the 1848 Communist Manifesto which was likewise designed to shore up a minority view in the hope that the ideas expressed therein would inevitably triumph because they were so logical and self-evident. When one exchanges the words \\"oppression by the bourgeois class\\" for \\"religious oppression\\" one will find considerable similarities between these two documents. This is especially true for the assumption that abolition of classes in the Marx and Engels manifesto, and abolition of religion in the case of Dawkins, will usher in the messianic age of pace, harmony and good will among the majority if not all human beings. But past history does not bear this out. The French Revolution, which abolished religion, led to the reign of terror and so did Lenin's 1917 revolution. Let us also not forget that National Socialism was guided by reason and logic, as soon as one bought into the basic premise of what has been called \\"social Darwinism\\" and one was \\"racially pure Aryan.\\" Dawkins does not mention these precedents and may regard them as aberrations, but religious people can then point out that the excesses which have occurred under organized religions were likewise deviations from the norm rather than the norm itself.   Dawkins is correct in stating that religious dogmas are incompatible with scientific facts and that the probability for the existence of a creator God who personally influences our daily lives is small. I agree with Dawkins on this point and it was the reason why I wrote The Jesus Conundrum-A Search for Truth beyond Dogma, as well as related articles on my website. Nevertheless, it should also be pointed out that when it comes to the existence or non-existence of God we are dealing with opinions rather than theories or hypothesis which can be experimentally verified.    Although Dawkins has discussed some objections to a purely scientific approach to life there is an additional reason why science does not lend itself to a proof for the existence of God. First of all, instead of \\"science\\" in the abstract we should talk about the scientific method. It relies on measurements which in turn result from phenomena which have been visually apprehended and put into language. Even if the language consists originally of mathematical formulas they have to be retranslated into ordinary language so that others can evaluate it. These are significant limitations and they exclude the workings of the inner mind. If one wants to, one can analyze Shakespeare's works scientifically and we will be stuck with word counts, sentence structure etc., but that aspect which makes Shakespeare - Shakespeare, the feelings and thoughts which his words arouse in us will be entirely lost. I submit that a similar situation pertains in relation to our feelings about God.   As a scientist I have no problem accepting current scientific results and the idea of natural selection, but as a human being I also think about the why and wherefore. \\"To be steeped in natural selection, immersed in it, swim about in it,\\" may work for Dawkins but not for me. The difference is that Dawkins seems to live mentally in a digital universe where there are zeros and ones, yes or no, true or false; while mine is populated by yes-buts, qualifications which allow for an \\"as well as\\" approach, and attempts at synthesis of the best ideas rather than mere total rejection of one for another.    These are, of course, personal aspects but to believe that human beings have reached the status of Homo sapiens is wishful thinking as the events of the past and current century prove. To achieve that status we still have a long way to go and digital thinking, in the manner of Dawkins, will not get us there. The true-false, good-evil, right-wrong dichotomies, of the religious as well as secular variety, have gotten us into the wars we are currently engaged in and are likely to bring about further catastrophes. Dawkins decries moderation and tolerance but unless we come to a meeting of minds by mutual concessions we will continue to kill each other regardless of the name the killing is ostensibly done for. We don't need \\"secular humanism\\" which is opposed to \\"religious humanism;\\" let us instead create a \\"Humane society,\\" not just for animals but people.    The amazon program seems to have a problem at this time and this is why I have to append my response to Mr. E. Bordon's comment here:  Thank you for your comments which deal with fundamental problems the human race has struggled with for the past 2500 years and I have dealt with them in various Hot Issues of my website [...] I have also tried to answer Pilate's question, \\"What is Truth?\\" in the last chapter of The Jesus Conundrum-Searching for Truth beyond Dogma and shall, therefore, be brief. You have raised the question of pride and I agree that certain religious communities also show an extraordinary pride in their belonging to an electgroup. But that doesn't make it right, and fighting fire with fire leaves the landscape desolate. There was good reason why the Catholic Church as well as Buddhism, has declared pride a sin in the first instance, and as a human defilement in the second. There is a difference beween \\"a god\\" who has a specific name, associated with some specific properties, and the concept of \\"God\\" as spirit which cannot be named and whose properties are unknown; although one hopes that they are predominantly benign. This \\"God\\" resides in the innermost depths of the human being and as such is a subjective experience which cannot be objectified. Even talking about it cannot do justice because words are already symbols and inadequate ones to boot. The mistake which is made by \\"professional atheists\\" (defined as: individuals who feel the necessity to destroy the religious faith of others) is that they do not want to realize that the human being does not live only in the physical universe, which can be apprehended through science, but also lives in an inner world of thoughts and emotions which take over as soon as one closes the eyes or \\"daydreams.\\" Yet they are the mainsprings of speech, reason and conduct. Since they are subjective and intensely personal they are not accessible to scientific methodology. As an example one can take a sonnet by Shakespeare. One can scientifically study it in terms of rhyme, length of sentences, word usage etc. But why does it profoundly affect one person and is a \\"so what\\" for another? One can readily analogize this to the concept of God and why an agreement on God's existence or non-existence will never be reached by the majority of humanity. While God is a \\"delusion\\" for Dawkins and an \\"illusion\\" for Freud, God is the essence of one's being for others. Absolute truth is not obtainable by human beings and what we regard as truth at a given time may become either patently false, or more commonly partially true at another. Even in science we are not dealing with unadulterated objective truth. A given scientific fact is ascertained with a specific methodology and is true within that limitation. But, to make it useful, this fact has to be \\"interpreted\\" and this is the point where subjectivity can overpower science and lead to \\"scientism.\\" That glaciers have considerably shrunk in size during the 20th century is a measurable fact which anyone can convince oneself of. The argument is not over the shrinking, but its cause which continues to be endlessly debated by reputable scientists. Tolerance is indeed a worthwhile goal but it should be practiced in one's conduct and labeling other human beings who cannot share someone else's belief system, even if bolstered by scientific results (which are irrelevant for the question at hand), as deluded does not help matters. As I said earlier, atheists and agnostics should be granted equal respect to those of \\"religious people,\\" as befits their status as human beings, and when either group oversteps the boundaries of decency it should be taken to task. As mentioned the questions you raise are indeed fundamental to our outlook on life and I shall devote the June installment of the Hot Issues under the title \\"Digital Thinking\\" to further discussion.

B002ZHKZEM|5.0|I normally watch anything I buy on DVD first on TV or by some other medium to be sure I really want to own it.  With the Doctor, I had been watching it all on SyFy (SciFi channel), but these specials haven't been aired to the best of my knowledge.  So I took a chance and got the set on sale (Yeah Amazon!).  Wow, what a great way to end Tennant's fantastic run.  When they brought the Doctor back with Eccleston, I was impressed.  Wasn't too happy to see him go, but quickly started enjoying the 10th Doctor as much as the 9th.      SPOILERS!!!    The first story threw me for a loop, The Next Doctor.  I admit I was suckered in with the title and expected that to be the next doctor.  It was an early look at the major personality shift in the doctor, that his view point can be persuaded.  Nicely done.    Planet of the Dead was by far my favorite of all the specials.  Michelle Ryan should have been given the status of a companion way earlier.  It was so much fun to watch her and the Doctor playing off of each other with such bravado and quick wit.  IMO, much better than the short lived Bionic Woman show.  It was great seeing UNIT again, even without Martha or the Brigadier, and hopefully we'll see more of Malcolm in the future as well.    Waters of Mars was one of the most eerie shows I've seen in a long time, watching the Doctor walk away as the people were dying, and the major attitude adjustment(s) that came about because of it.  I can honestly say that I've never seen such a sad and joyful turn of events all at once.  Bravo to Tennant for such a remarkable portrayal of the Doctor and giving us a view at the kind of inner torment an Immortal would be possesed of.  If someone is wishing to buy these specials separately, this would the one that I would insist owning just because of the remarkable character development.    And last, but certainly not least, The End of Time.  It took me a bit of thinking to keep up with everything that was going on with the Time Lords, because I was busy looking for all of the references and guest shots, etc.  I was expecting just a bit more of a revelation with Wilfred, his tie with the Time Lords, etc, but another one was knocked out of the park with casting Tim Dalton as Rasalon!  Wow!  He was perfect for it!  And of course the return of the Master.  I really enjoy watching the Doctor and the Master go at it, (don't judge me) even more than the Daleks or Cybermen.  Although his blow up of powers was a bit over the top... it was still quite a treat to see him return.  \\"The Master Race!\\"  Oh my!  My only real dissapointment in the story was not seeing Christopher Eccleston make a cameo at the end to help his successor into the Tardis or some such.  Would have been perfect in my book.    I'm not going to comment on the extras, or lack thereof, as many others have done so.  I will just say that this was a great set of episoded to bid farewell to the memorable 10th Doctor, and hopefully in the future we'll get to see him do a crossover with Matt Smith or in another way.  I really believed that he didn't want to leave the show, with as much emotion as he seemed to pour into it, and it makes me wonder if the story that we were given is correct or not.     Enjoy!
141654917X|1.0|I read My Sister's Keeper because of all the hype surrounding it and the plot of organ-donors' rights/responsibilities seemed compelling. However, this novel is executed in such a contrived, melodramatic fashion I could barely keep my focus on what the plot tries to be--a realistic family drama using childhood illness as a vehicle. The changing of perspective didn't bother me but the cliche characterizations and \\"punchy\\" dramatic one-liners did. While I'm not a huge fan of minimalism this book could have used some trimming because there were so many whiny, naval-gazing sentences that could have been cut with the story continuing to make sense. And also as others have pointed out the ending was unrealistic but also horrifying (to imply that only one of the sisters could survive cosmically made me feel sick) and made just a poorly written book, for me, a poorly written, manipulative book. Essentially, while many people adore this book as a tear-jerker, I believe that Picoult delivered popular fiction packaged as literary fiction that was disrespectful of her readers.

I origninally wrote the checklists are harder to implement and I can say they have become easier to write - especially with the involvement of the people who will use the checklist. This book isn't just for medical professionals - I work in the customer service field and we have implemented several checklists with positive results from our staff and our customers.
B001ILHY1I|5.0|This is a good action adventure movie, and if you like Jason Statham, you will love this one!  Ladies, he is drool material in this one!  Guys, if you like action and lots of it, you'll like this one too!  Kinda violent, so not for the faint of heart.
0061807400|5.0|Received Shutter Island in great shape...though it seemed a long time, shipment was timely. I would buy from the seller again.
B0002KQNUO|5.0|This is a great CD, it was not the cast we saw perform in 2009, but is still VERY good.
B002ZG983M|5.0|I just got back from watching this movie in the theater an hour ago, it made me cry with laughter. I don't just want to write a synopsis of the movie that will just take the piss out of it for anyone who reads this review. But I have to say that any movie where the father puts a kevlar vest on his 11 year old daughter and shoots her 3 times in the chest with a glock to get her used to the effect is totally insane. OK, after having just written that you probably think I'm a sicko, you'll understand if you just go see the movie!
B0024FADDI|4.0|Bruce Campbell stars in Sam Raimi's 1992 horror sequel.  A man is sent to 1300 A.D. battling the undead for an  ancient book. This is my favorite of the trilogy and  Bruce is great in this as usual. This dvd has good   picture and sound plus some neat extras. Get this.
B000MNP2K8|5.0|The DVD arrived on time & in good shape.  It is as advertised - brand new, still sealed in its original shrink wrap.  I enjoy the added features that tell many things about finding a new actor to play the role of James Bond, how the picture was made, and what it means to be a \\"Bond Girl.\\"  I had watched the film when it was first released, & now I can feast my eyes on Daniel Craig whenever I want to.  Saw him in person along with Hugh Jackman in a two man play on Broadway.  I believe he's a fine actor, & don't agree with some critics who thought he was rather \\"wooden\\" as Bond.  This movie gets the old adrenalin flowing with its chase scenes, intertwined mysteries, and high energy action in general.
B002WY65VU|4.0|Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg star in this 2009 horror   comedy. Four people stick together surviving against hungry  zombies. Woody's terrific in this and this dvd has nice picture  and sound plus cool extras. Definitely pick up this great horror  comedy.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I love Avatar. I think it is a great movie. I highly recommend it. I am confused by all these reviews. Everyone is complaining that the movie is not being released in 3D. How many people are willing to spend $5000 for a 3D TV and Blu-ray Player? There are a lot of other 3D movies out there. Granted Avatar looks fantastic in 3D in the theater. Unfortunately watching Avatar at home in 3D is not an option. I don't feel we should berate the movie because we can't watch it at home in 3D. I agree that it sucks that they don't include any extras in the standard DVD version. However, how many people actually watch the extra stuff? Does it really matter for most people? Let's keep our reviews to the movie and not the DVD and Blu-ray content. Avatar needs to be celebrated as another great movie by James Cameron.
B000A3XY9Q|4.0|Bruce Campbell stars in Sam Raimi's 1987 horror sequel.  A man and a group of people are trapped in a cabin  fighting demonic possession. I've always loved this   film and glad to have this dvd that has nice picture  and sound plus cool extras. I highly recommend this  great horror sequel.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|There is not a single thing I can say that others have not already said in their reviews. This was simply one of the most energizing and thought provoking books that I have read in sometime. Thank you so much for taking he time to share the journey.
B0001FYPZU|1.0|I cannot see this DVD on my television. It is a Region 2. I have written to Amazon and the store that filled the order to return this DVD in exchange for one that will work but have had no response. I am unhappy with the service of Amazon.
B000V659OU|3.0|Great Movie, received in timely manner. Can't thank Amazon and the sellers enough!!  We live in rural America and our  movie, book, etc. stores can't carry everything one might want. Thank God for Amazon, where you can find anything old or new.   We would be lost without the availability of Amazon.
B0019LY5IM|3.0|Content is A-ok. You're a \\"Lost\\" fan or you're not - so content is good, or not.<br /><br />But why, why, why, after four seasons of consistent packaging do we all of a sudden get something entirely different? No hard plastic sleeve, and the box itself is of a different construction as well. Hello ABC? Maybe I like it when a TV-series on my bookshelve looks like a *series*?
B000IOLZZW|4.0|I didn't like this movie the first time I watched it, however, when I watched it the second time, I was able to catch Jim Carrey's lines and mannerisms better.  Its definitely becoming one of our favorite holiday movies !
B000002P72|5.0|In my view, this is THE live blues disc to own.  This is BB in his prime.  I was born much too late to witness this era so this album gives me a chance to hear what I missed.  Classics like \\"Sweet Little Angel\\" and \\"How Blue Can You Get\\" will never go out of style.  If you listen to and/or attend BB's concerts today, they are good but slightly slower paced and they drag a bit more.  This one is probably his best recorded live concert.  The song selection and energy simply shine.    So many live concerts have been released by so many artists that it becomes very meaningless most of the time.  A very few are as precious and special as this one.      Enjoy!
B0035V35PI|5.0|Awesome guy flick with tons of action.  Great value to also get the digital download with it.
B00004TX5F|5.0|Although highly inaccurate in the portrayal of the world's most famous castrato, Farinelli is a good introduction to the magical world of Baroque Opera and a visually beautiful film with great costumes and sets.    The sets and costumes of the actual representations are great, in good form to the period and one wishes they could have been longer and shown more of the opera productions. The music is absolutely superb and I recommend getting the CD to hear the complete arias. There are plenty of extremely talented countertenors now reviving the part of the castratos all over the world: David Daniels, Dominique Vise and Andreas Scholl to name just a few that come to mind. Derek Lee Ragin was also excellent so I really do not see the need for the voice mix with a soprano, the ONLY choice for a mix, if any,  should have been Ewa Podles, a great alto singer that is also a great baroque technician.    The whole plot around Farinelli and Handel is silly. The opera he \\"steals\\" from him was a very early opera of Handel,(Rinaldo)  which was published by then and he could have bought it at the local music shop. Still, it is interesting from \\"the what if\\" point of view. Handel was and remains, one of the world's greatest and most talented composers. His operas are particularly beautiful and they have been coming back to the repertory since the 1920's but much more strongly in the past 20 years. \\"Xerxes\\" \\"Agripina\\", \\"Semele\\", \\"Flavio\\", \\"Alcina\\". \\"Partenope\\" and \\"Orlando\\" have all been revived at the NYCO in recent seasons with excellent productions and sold out houses. Even the stodgy, retrograde MET has staged his \\"Rinaldo\\" \\"Julius Caesar\\" and \\"Rodelinda\\". His stature as one of the finest opera composers of all time is finally been recognized and secured for future generations.    Strongly recommended for those interested in the Baroque period, particularly music.
0061849901|5.0|The book was shipped quickly and was received in the condition that it had stated when purchased.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|(Possible spoiler alert though I doubt it)-<br />Does John Cusak have any good movies left that are pitched to him? To say that this even had a realistic plot is going a far stretch. Outrunning earthquakes and destruction w/ a small airplane? Hopping across broken earth in an RV? Somehow breathing and seeing underwater to untangle cables to save the lives of everyone? I know that movies like this are just CGI-fests for the eyes but this is just too much. Reuniting of old lovers, your kids who ignored you now love you - basically any stereotype of safety net you could put in a movie is here. John Cusak must laugh his butt off on his way too the bank cashing these 'acting' checks. Another horrible plot with predictable acting and an even more predictable script. Just like the movie \\"day after Tomorrow\\" - you had a good idea that was plagued w/ bad acting and even worse scripts. Yeesh.<br />PS - Woody harrelson must of needed some weed money to accept a few scenes in this movie. His over the top performance as a 'hippie dude' (go figure) is just too much for me in this one.
0439023483|5.0|It arrived on the predicted date and it came in a good sized package. It was quick to purchase and it came almost as fast. Amazing.
1439138311|5.0|This Colm Toibin novel is one of the best books I have ever read. First of all, I love the delicate, thoughtful prose. The dialogue - such a hard thing for most writers to pull off - feels very real, too, as does the depiction of the immigrant experience. Slowly, patiently, and very deliberately, Toibin drew me in by narrating from protagonist Eilis' point of view and even reviewing previously-described events from Eilis' perspective. I was lulled into that state you may associate with a good movie: as you become attached to the characters, your stake in a particular sort of ending increases. And herein lies Toibin's skill: he drew me in *twice* -- tricked me with no trickery -- such that his quietly-worded ending delivered me an indescribably powerful punch. Unbelievable.
0439023491|5.0|The shipping was fast and easy. The book was awesome.... :D<br />I adore how quickly it came to me. I was so excited for it to arrive, Amazon gave me a feature to track where my package was and when it would arrive. I loved it! It gave me something to look forward too.
B0014NDXGA|4.0|I am happy with my decision to purchase V2 over a month ago. I have used it with great success for several rounds. I find it much quicker & easier to use than Sky Caddie I have used for 3 years.
B0035WTE2U|5.0|this is a particularly good cd for people who aren't too familiar with ac/dc, since you get songs from both brian johnson and bon scott.  current fans of ac/dc will already have all these songs, but it's still great to have them again.  it's also nice that songs that don't get as much airplay like \\"evil walks\\" or \\"guns for hire\\" are on here as well.  if only they could have found a place for \\"hells bells\\" in the movie...    oh yeah, and the dvd rocks too!
B002KSPKRS|4.0|ive got two sections, a summary for light readers and a detailed section for those who want something a little more in-depth.    summary: headset crackles and pops at longer distances and at random moments. works with any audio device you can hook up to your TV. chat cable jack is a bit unstable. volume and mic controls are inconvenient. removable mic boom is nice but can get turned the wrong way. mic feed back (hear yourself talk) isn't great. the extra 3.5 MM plug is nice. you need to sync headset, so only one headset per base. can use TV sound but not as easy as with the piggy back cables featured the previous models. you can take the bottom off so the base can lay flat but not recommended.    detailed: i found that sitting to far from the base (15 to 20 feet) leads to loud popping and cracking. This wouldn't be a problem but it does the same thing when i'm less than 10 feet away from the base as well. the reason i believe is because i use a wireless router, and they were fairly close to each other. After i rearranged my front room the problem lessened but is still present at some points during game play, especially when the batteries are getting close to the 25% mark. that said it doesn't do it that often but when it does it can break your concentration. i originally bought this for my PS3 and it worked great, but i couldn't get the digital audio to work. this means that the sound isn't full 7.1 Dolby surround sound, but even with turtle beaches emulated surround sound these rock! i recently bought an Xbox 360 and was eager to try the digital audio but the base system doesn't have the right cable. no biggy i guess. so i plugged in the chat cable (which only works with the 360) and i found myself frequently plugging the cable back into the headset because the jack on the head set isn't strong enough to hold the weight of anything more that the cable itself. so if you move wrong or turn your head the cable begins to pull out and activates the mic and you as well as your friends on live can hear a loud crackling noise. the end of the chat cable that plugs into the controller is L shaped instead of the original \\"puck\\" that has volume and a mic switch. instead these are located a couple inches up the cable on a rectangle in-line controller. i find this more difficult to use when toggling your mic a lot, like in a team based game. the removable mic boom is handy when you don't want to talk but can go ban in in multiple directions. this can be a hassle when your team members cant hear you as well because the mic is pointed away from your mouth. the X41s do have a bit of mic feed back, meaning you can hear your self talk but no where near as good as on the X3s. th optional 3.5 MM jack in the front of the base is really handy when you and your friends are playing at night and you only have one headset, but even if you have a second headset you will need a second base as well. unlike the X3s and X4s they have to sync with the base. you can of course use the TV sound, if your TV has and audio out and you have a spare composite cable then you can hook your system up to your TV and still use your headset. the bottom \\"foot\\" on the base can come off so it can lay flat but i wouldn't recommend it, i accidentally broke mine.
B00338QENI|4.0|This reads like 3 different kinds of books.  The first part talks about Henrietta's illness and family.  I at times found parts of it confusing as alot of different family members were introduced.  The middle part reads like a good non-fiction science book, as it talks about the Hela cells and how scientists used them for research.  The last part ties in how the author developed a relationship with Henrietta's daughter.  While reading this part I kept envisioning how it would look as a feature movie.  This is a very interesting true story and would make a great movie.  I hope Oprah or someone hears me!
B001U88814|2.0|Love Crocs, but both times I receive this pair (returned both) there was a seam at the toe that was annoying. It was right on the big toe and made these shoes very uncomfortable. One had the seam on the right shoe, and the other pair had in on the left.
0307454541|5.0|This is a great mystery that twists and turns and never stops moving. As a pure mystery, this is excellent. On top of that, the characters are fascinating, especially Lisbeth (the girl with the dragon tattoo). It's been a while since I was as intrigued by a fictional character as I found myself with her. Between the main plot, multiple subplots, and great characters, I was engaged through the 600 pages. The subplots were expertly woven into the main story of a missing girl that happened a generation before. I spent the last 200 pages torn between needing to finish this and wanting to let it last longer. This was the best book I have read in quite a while.  This has it all - mystery, violence, love, sex, family intrigue, financial intrigue. Amazingly, all these pieces form a very cohesive whole!
1433502445|5.0|There are not words enough to describe this Bible. The study notes, which cover so many topics, are very helpful and thorough. I love all of the drawings, maps, and diagrams, as well as introductions for each book, which give a lot of background information and suggestions for how to study.  I think it is excellent for anyone wanting to know more about the Bible, or understand it better.
B001152TL6|5.0|This is an awful print of the film and not worth the purchase.  I recommend the 2-disc version on region 2, a fine anamorphic print ,with a vibrant DTS track.  David Lynch is the master of the surreal and if you want to experience it properly then check out the european print
B00000J048|4.0|Colorful gears of different sizes and colors rotating around in different directions, being able to move them around to create custom patterns, learning about mechanical things and holding the interest of two girls, one just turned four and the other barely two. And the adults love it and make the kids cry as they take over...that is the sign of a very good gift indeed.    The report is that two months later, they still play with it regularly.     Don't be worried about having to keep track of all the little parts. They will be mounted on the base board, so it will end up being just one thing.    Anyone who works with real gears knows that it is sometimes hard to remove them from their shafts and that you can break them if you don't do it correctly. Like real life, the gear game suffers from this. It is not easy for little kids to remove the gears, so they get rough and break the little axles they rotate on. The crank that turns the gears was broken within minutes, but wasn't really missed as the kids turn them by hand anyway.    This is one great toy. Fix the axle system and add different boards that join together so that more shapes can be made and it would be perfect.    I had to remove a star for the durability factor.
B000OVLBF8|2.0|Ghost Rider is one of those films who's entertainment factor is truly limited to the viewers own interests. Basically,if you don't like motorcycles or flaming skeletons...then you won't like this film. The only real pros for this movie are it's near 2 hour length/good special effects/the hell cycle/ and Peter Fonda's portrayal of satan.Conversly, the film suffers from a weak plot that is chocked full of \\"CHEESY\\" dialogue and features less than stellar acting by many cast members.The single disc version of the film contains few \\"special features\\", with only basic commentaries/2 short documentaries and some trailers for other movies. Bottom line, if you like motorcycles (like I do) or have to own every movie ever made then you might enjoy this film. Barring those criteria, you're libal to find the film version of this great character to be no more appealing than if it were being done as a high school play.It's altogether too watered down with acting and dialogue that's way too cheesy and a main character that just isn't meant to be pg-13 material.
141694737X|5.0|My son is 10 months old and he spends so much time with this book.  He seeks it out, plops onto the floor, and lifts the flaps over and over.  My favorite feature, the flaps don't tear off as easily as other lift-the-flap books, like the Spot series (which my son also loves, but I am forever taping the flaps back).
B0002KVUKM|5.0|Van Helsing was one of those rare occurences in our modern film industry, it succeeded in taking us back to the good ol' days of monster movies where even the bad guys had personality and weren't merely mutated/brain eating/thoughtless ogres or zombies. The film was cast perfectly,with most all of the actors demonstrating great chemistry and keeping their characters believable and well out of \\"cheese\\" territory.The sets and action sequences within them are wonderful and highly reminiscent of the old-school style of filmaking.There are many famous old-school villains such as: (The Wolfman/Frankenstein/Mr. hyde/Dracula/ect.) The film's CGI and Special Effects are some of the best in the industry and add significantly to the story.The plot of the film is very well written and does an excellent job of balancing such a large variety of classic characters and effectively connecting them to each other.Add on a length of slightly more than 2 hours and a pulse-pounding musical score and you've got a truly epic film.Bonus features include: (several documentaries/bloopers/movie trailers for Van Helsing and Shrek 2/an xbox compatible demo of the Van Helsing Videogame/commentaries/ect.) Van Helsing is one of those films that deserves a spot in every movie lovers dvd collection.If you enjoy watching movies at all, then you must see this film.
B000WTBMBK|5.0|Vocals are very Dave Gahan-ish which makes this record far better than what Depeche Mode has put out lately. Listening to this album will transport you to a new, fascinating albeit slightly creepy place.
B000GFRJ58|5.0|what a classic! great music and service just as good! id recomend buying from this seller again!
B00007LTIA|3.0|I originally owned this album on LP (and what a beautiful Roger Dean gatefold it was!), but never really loved the music. I'd loved The Yes Album, Fragile and Close to the Edge before acquiring Tales, and couldn't help feeling let down by it. At the time I was excited by the idea of an album made up of four sidelong tracks, but the actual work left much to be desired.     The album is so ambitious, so sprawling that it simply feels unfocused compositionally and the performances, while competent, feel ragged and indulgent. That said, there are passages in every piece where a strong melody and good ensemble performance coalesce if only for a few minutes at a time.     The final track \\"Ritual\\" fairs the best, thanks to strong thematic material and an exciting percussion section. However, even this piece sounds better as a live (albeit bisected) performance on the live set Yesshows that followed a few years later.     Ultimately none of the four side-long tracks measures up to its predecessor \\"Close to the Edge\\" or \\"Gates of Delirium\\" from Relayer, the album that followed Tales -- both of which feature memorable melodic content and mind-bending virtuosity.
1427208476|5.0|The CD version of Sarah's Key read by Polly Stone had me feeling I was in a theater watching the performance! She (Stone) has a magnificent gift for dramatically portraying this compelling story. I could not wait for each chapter; yet I didn't want the \\"performance\\" to end!
0810988232|5.0|Quite honestly, I've not had a lot of time, yet, to really explore this book or the deck of cards.  However, from what I've read and from flipping through the deck, I'm pleased.    The text is much simplified from the previous 'The Faery Oracle Cards', which may be good or bad, I don't know yet.  However, the cards are even more gorgeous, if that's possible.  I really loved reading the large book 'The Heart of Faerie', which I found to be lush and informative.    I actually bought this current book/deck for a friend's birthday (since she has no Froud products but has enjoyed all of mine).  The box arrived unsealed and slightly squashed and I hesitated to give it to her in that condition.  Was it truly new?  It was supposed to be.  So, I ordered a second deck so that I would have one.  The second deck also arrived unsealed (no celophane) but unsquashed (which is the version I'll give her).  Why no celophane?    Notwithstanding, I expect I'll enjoy this deck and that my friend and I will have great fun exploring our decks when we go on retreat next month, to the place where we first got turned on to the world of Froud.  A place filled with spirits of nature:  Breitenbush Hot Springs.
B0030IIZ1A|5.0|Toy Story the original is the best!! The story is cute, the humor is adult as well as child-like and the characters are exciting.  Disney-Pixar at it's best.
1594481717|4.0|Dan Pink lays out his premise that right-brained people (synthesizers) will be in higher demand than left-brain people (analyzers) in the US in a few short years.  As an analyzer, that captured my attention right away.  Specifically, he cites the loss of traditional, white-collar jobs to other (cheaper) parts of the world.  But ... all hope is not lost.  Dan lays out a cogent methodology for helping people transform themselves into \\"Cultural Creatives.\\"  His six senses provide a road map for exercising and strengthening one's right brain.<br /><br />I had the pleasure of hearing Mr. Pink speak in June, 2009 to an audience of educators seeking guidance in shaping their curriculum to address the 21st century learner, and ultimately US workers.  Dan is even more engaging on stage than in his book.  After hearing Dan peak, this group spent a full day of training and workshops on the Six Senses.  It was amazing to see how this concept of the six senses came to life when close attention and energy is focused on these often overlooked, and sometimes, seemingly unimportant skills.
B00275EGX8|3.0|The film didn't deserve to win Best Picture for 2009. It was entertaining and I understand what the director was trying to accomplish. The movie flows well and I do recommend seeing it. I would wait for the price to drop if you're purchasing the Blu-Ray version. War is a horrible thing but for some reason we are all drawn toward stories about war. It takes you on the trip reminding you how horrible things are for our men and women that serve our country over seas in war zones in these unstable countries. The perspective of the bomb disposal unit reminds us of a dangerous job not often portrayed as the main theme in films but as a sideline. I give credit to the writer for creating this story and being able to hold interest throughout the film. Though this movie is fiction, the region where this film  takes place brings a realistic view of the dangers still being faced there by our armed forces at this time.
B003405MF6|5.0|Got this CD today.  I am astounded!  If you have an audiophile 2 channel system, this is your new demo disc.  I'm mellowing with age and this CD gets 5 stars.
0812973992|5.0|Other than knowing that this book revolved around the renowned tightrope walk between the twin towers of The World Trade Center in the 1970s. After three chapters, I mistakenly thought this was a book of short stories. McCann deftly weaves the story through chapters which introduce seemingly new characters who have tangently been involved in the story. A masterpiece.
0307476154|5.0|Lisbeth Salander, one of the more intriguing characters to come along in awhile, is back for another go around in The Girl Who Played With Fire. Murder, mayhem and cyber-hacking madness are turned up a notch in this, the 2nd part of a trilogy. There's alot going on here, and I'll admit maybe it could have been edited slightly, but that in no way should stop you from picking up this extremely well-written, exciting novel.<br /><br />Lisbeth is far from warm and fuzzy, but due to the talented Larsson, she stays with you far after you've finsihed reading. There are a few far-fetched scenes late in the novel, where Lisbeth needs to get physical with MUCH  bigger, stronger, more dastardly people...but mentally I'd put her up against anyone.<br /><br />Many people have put The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo slightly ahead of Fire. Dragon may have been more original, but Fire is more jacked-up...both are highly entertaining...I usually wait for the paperback versions of fiction novels, but I'm going to make an exception with The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets Nest, part 3 of the trilogy. I simply can't wait until next year for the paper version.
B003405MF6|4.0|but I feel like I've heard this before it winds up in my mailbox. My first thought is that I will welcome a rare, laid back Beck offering. I'm 56 and have been a fan since the Yardbirds. I put him aside during the Truth (great album) Rod Stewart years only to jump on the bandwagon from Rough & Ready and beyond. His sporadic output doesn't leave much to be critized. Only a few releases have disappointed me. Guitar Shop? Perhaps I should go back and give it another listen. (It seemed to be nothing more than a noodleing idea at the time) Crazy Legs? Jeff's tribute to the ancients; at the time I wanted new Jeff. His techo years? Who Else was, IMO, his best work in that period, still play it often. Jeff? Too much thrash-techo? Ronnie Scott's? OK, now we're talkin' GREAT STUFF. I am glad he's turned the corner with some new ideas. My wife and I, along with several other couples/friends have great seats for his June appearance here in Indy. Does anyone doubt he will give us ample offerings of in your face fret-bending magic?   In closing, I applaud his new direction and, hopefully, he can continue to create new ideas for all us fans for the next several years.  Maybe I should go back and give Guitar Shop another listen.
B001JE25ZE|5.0|I am Legend was made into 3 movies, Vincent Price's \\"The Last Man on Earth\\", the Charlton Heston film \\"Omega Man\\" and the Will Smith film \\"I am Legend\\". Each of these movies are superb, yet the novel is different and better.<br />The story is set in a post apocalyptic world and tells about Robert Neville, the last survivor of a mutant virus that turned all humans into evil vampires. Neville fights with depression as he deals with being alone, and is haunted by the vampires from outside his fortified home. Over several years, Neville kills the vampires in the day as they sleep. He experiments with different methods in repelling and killing vampires. A surprise ending, that pleases the reader.
B002QQ8HAG|3.0|I might have expected a lot of reactions to these characters, but boring wasn't one of them.  In the end, we learn that beneath all the glamour an office is an office.  I have more colorful characters in my own office than these rather banal folks who are doing a rather banal job like everybody else.  Ms. Wintour may have been playing to the camera, but her reactions to different situations seemed reasonable.  Certainly not over the top by any stretch, even when she disapproved.  Nobody seemed afraid to tell her no or to fight back against her wishes or to interject their own opinions in her presence.  Given all the hype around this woman, I would have expected less bravado on their parts.      Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the film was the obvious insecurity she felt for being the idol of millions, yet never earning the respect of her own family with what they see as her frivolous career choice.  There was genuine sadness behind those laughs.
0061537969|5.0|Denny Swift is just an ordinary guy who has a dream to be a race car driver. One day he picks out a puppy from a farm outside of Seattle, and a tremedous love story is born. Denny names this little pup Enzo. (After Enzo Ferrari)     The story is told from Enzo's perspective, which is quite unique. Yes, there has to be a suspension of belief on the reader's part in order for this to succeed. But who among us who has pets (dog, cat, bird, fish, whatever!) hasn't fully determined that our pets can not only understand every word we say to them, but are really formulating thoughts to us in their minds, but cannot speak those thoughts? This book gives us the fantasy of exploring what it might be like to know if our dogs could think and develop thoughts.    The storyline is not one of roses, sunshine, and butterflies. It would hardly be a story, then. All stories must have conflict, and this one certainly does as well. There is heartbreak and sadness - emotions that exist in life. Yet, there is also love and laughter.     If you've ever had a animal that shared in your life, you can relate to both Denny and Enzo and the bond they share. The closeness, happiness, love, and yes, even the sadness. It's all here, just as in life. I enjoyed every minute I shared with Enzo!
B00337KM2S|4.0|George Clooney has a tendency to pick movies with great dialogue and original storylines every year.  In 2009, it paid of with this drama that nabbed a Best Picture nomination at the Oscars.  The story background is about around a man whose professional life is traveling from company to company, where his job is to fire people.  The plot focuses on his life, and how it is complicated by a female colleague who is trying to change how he does his job.  There are numerous surprises throughout the movie, which is anchored by great dialogue from all the characters.  There is some romance, and some comedy.  Overall, a good movie, though I do not think it deserved a Best Picture nomination when other, better movies from 2009, such as Star Trek and Harry Potter, did not get a nod.

B00006LFGD|4.0|This album was like a wonderful surprise package.  I've always been a Barbra fan, but had not known she had recorded duets with other famous singers. Each song was like a little musical jewel with Barbra's  beautiful voice blending in with the distinctive qualities of the other singers.
B001HOF8AA|5.0|This CD is excellent. Imelda May's got a great sound. The music is catchy, and May is able to expand out to other styles, such as a very traditional waltz in Falling in Love With You Again, with tremendous success. This CD has become my new favorite.
0714843377|5.0|this is really a simple book. its really simple. some people expect a writer to walk you step by step and hold your hand to success but it doesnt work like that. it's more a motivational book to remind you to step outside the box and to remain creative and fresh. i love it. big words and fonts to keep the book simple and the photographer/creative artist to continue doing what he or she loves......    good book i would reccomend
B001HN69B8|2.0|I was surprised to see so many positive reviews about this film.  For me it was a huge disappointment because I love most Terry Gilliam films and this was... ok, it was a Gilliam film but it was a watered down, rushed and very hard to swallow.  Premise is: Old dude with mental powers has been gambling with the devil for centuries and, in the way, the old dude (Parnassus) gets a daughter which allegedly will be owned by the devil when she turns 16.  Movie starts a couple of days before her birthday. Old dude wants to stop it and bets again with the devil.  Premise is good (hence two stars) but that is it!!!  Old dude and the devil bet on who can to gain most souls.  How does old dude gains souls?:  Apparently Dr Parnasus lets people enter the realms of their own imaginations and presents them with a choice... they choose wrong they go literally to the devil, they choose right... Well apparently they just come out happy from their own imaginations... But then again... were they in their own imaginations?  We are told time and time again that they were in the doctor's mind so... People are supposed to enter their own imaginations trough the mind of the doctor to which you can access trough a mirror... so.... People enter their imaginations trough the mind of the doctor trough a mirror.... Ooooookeeeey.  I, know, I know its Gilliam... but... c'mon!!!  It would be possible to let the all this \\"farfetchedness\\" go but the \\"imaginary\\" realms look just like screen savers and wall papers made by... I dont know, wallpaper and screen savers designers?  They are nice, but hey are just generic and they seemed to be made with generic software by generic people... And talking about people... People is supposed to change when they enter the imaginary realms, but apparently just certain people: a drunk at the beginning of the movie and the character played by Heath Ledger, Jhony Dep, Jude Law and Colin Farrel.  And who is supposed to be this character?  He is the hanged man, a troubled man who finds himself traveling with the old dude his daughter, midget and aid. Obviously the daughter will have a thing for him, the aid will be jealous of him (for he is in love with the daughter) and the midget will be suspicious of him (because apparently that is what midgets do).  The acting is... mediocre... Effects are awful... and it just doesn't have that endearing quality that most of Gilliam's film have.  I couldn't identify with any of the characters in the screen, I didn't care about them and quite frankly, I was  happy to see them go when the movie ended.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|I am a Huge FPS fan, and love using my G13 for CSS, BC2, and MW2.  My largest complaint comes from laziness.  Rebuilding the button configurations for each game individually is a chore i do not enjoy, but once it is done it is done.    When i first began using the G13 i notice my wrist and fingers hurting (almost like stretching) and figured out that it was because of the ergonomic style of the device.  Now, after 4+ months of use, i find the device to be more comfortable then my G110 or G15(Classic) keyboards.      However much i use this though, i can't help but think that it really isn't adding anything i don't already have.  Which is to say, i don't need it, at least not for fps.  I will re-review when i jump back into WOW at the Cataclysm release and attempt to take full advantage of the 22 buttons for my Paly spells.  Never the less, this is a solid device and does its job well.

0634029355|2.0|This isn't worth your money. Doug runs through each song in about three or four minutes, he doesn't give you time to learn it.  Unless you've already mastered transcribing (and then why buy this dvd?), you're going to be left to rewinding a million times to get the right notes.    This is no better than a youtube video of someone playing a bunch of clapton songs.  Doug doesn't even show you the rhythm or other guitar parts! You're left only knowing the lead!  What sense does that make?

B000QB36LS|5.0|Esther Greenwood, a college student from Massachusetts wins a dream assignment, with eleven other students, on a big New York fashion magazine.  Esther is vulnerable and impressionable and is unable to enjoy her assignment; some of her experiences frighten and disorient her.  Esther does not fit in with either of her friends: the rebellious Doreen or the conformist Betsy.<br /><br />Returning home, Esther finds that she has not been accepted into a writing course she applied for, and this leads her to consider what choices she has in life.  Thus begins a descent into depression, and a very personal form of madness.<br /><br />It is easy to see autobiographical parallels with Sylvia Plath's own life.  Perhaps too easy, and this can detract from a broader message of identity and belonging, which so many of us experience and can relate to.  I first read part of this novel as a teenager, almost 40 years ago.  I read it then as an autobiographical novel which, while it raised many of the questions I was considering myself, had no comfortable answers.  Coming back to the novel now, I see that I wasn't looking past the tragedy of Sylvia Plath's own death to appreciate the writing for its own sake.  While Ms Plath took her own life at age 30, that this was a (tragic) choice, not an inevitable outcome.<br /><br />So, why read this novel now?  It was published almost 50 years ago and while aspects of the setting reflect that, the underlying search for identity and purpose are timeless.  For me, this is a novel worth reading twice.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
B001CZAVXI|5.0|normally i wouldn't just come out with guns blazing after reading someone else's review, but in the case of the last reviewer i feel i must not only come out  blazing but reload and then keep reloading. he clearly just based his reviews on his own feelings and not the movie.<br /><br />hold a sec while a reload...<br /><br />so the movie. in one's lifetime rarely does a movie, er, move you on so many different levels. from mike figgis' trumpet playing, which is haunting and lonely, the notes of which act as the stepping stones on the pathway to the character's end, to cage's acting, the movie is quite literally - perfect. By far some of nicolas cage's best work and you won't find a more believable, real and engaging film. even shue, whose acting in later years is less than stellar, fits right into this role, and honestly, i would not have wanted anything about the casting changed.<br /><br />The beauty of this film lay in its honesty, which is brutal at the very least (perhaps this is why the last reviewer use the word repugnant). not only does it go a good job at capturing the downward spiral of someone who has lost it all, but it captures the despair and misery of losing it all to alcoholism.<br /><br />the movie also is honest about relationships. too often movies establish an unrealistic, trite and superficial love story that just comes off as puke-evoking. the beauty of shue and cage's relationship is how each accept each other unconditionally despite their flaws - she a las vegas prostitute, and he a raging alcoholic there to drink himself to death, which he openly admits to her. at one point in the movie cage says to her, \\"you can never ask me to stop drinking.\\" chilling.<br /><br />it's witty, humorous and sad in all the right combinations. to this day (i just said it again the other day), it remains as one of my Top 10 movies of all time.<br /><br />see the movie. even after a decade or more in the can, this movie still holds its own to this day.<br /><br />ww
B0037AGASG|5.0|I'm not a 16-year-old girl, and I thoroughly enjoy this album. I think this kid has a great voice and the album has some great beats and lyrics on it. We all know that anyone who 'hates' him is envious of his fast success and his cute baby face that makes girls swoon. Everyone knows you can't stop girls once they're 'in love' with something. Just let it go. Let them be girls, and let this kid do what he does best. Give him a break. He deserves the success.
B0026SCMNM|3.0|I was enjoying this book at first but seemed always expecting more action by the simple main character.  It seems to me that the author got tired of writing and decided to end the book after that silly phone call.  There was so much more to be resolved. I was very disappointed.
B000LPS4BG|5.0|One of the great mob movies of all time.  Having been involved in the investigation of Organized Crime, I believe this film is closest to the true lives  of mafia and mafia associates.
B001FB4W02|5.0|I have been a big a fan of this series since it first aired quite a few years ago. The series as a whole has had it's ups and downs, but I have never felt like it was not worth my time to watch. This season finally got back to the roots of the superman/Clark Kent persona. It got rid of previous characters with worn out episode ideas while getting back to what made Smallville great. The development of the many characters and the chemistry of the actors is really what makes this show worth watching. In my opinion, the greatest thing about this season is that it got rid of the character of Lana Lang and went back to developing the relationship between Clark and Lois. The episodes have also started to get much more interesting as well. With apperances from different Justice League characters and intriguing plot twists, the writers really had me waiting for each new episode to air. I would whole heartedly recommend this season to anyone who has been a fan of previous seasons or anyone that just enjoys good story telling with excellent actor chemistry.
B002T45VX6|1.0|With a price/share performance rating 20 - 35% greater than expected, this offering by the Yu-San Corporation will surpass the sales levels of any musical production system that has been previously released. In an interview with Yu-San's head of Research and Development, Sam Wolferson, he attributed the success of his Shakira project in part to Yu-San's partner in this venture: Genentec Organic Systems, Inc.    Mr. Wolferson stated: \\"Genentec's assistance in securing new Bio-mass samples from South America was essential. Their contacts in Columbia were able to acquire rare jaguar, anaconda and rare insect samples which resulted in a very unique bio-shell for our Musicanator 346 sound generation machine. Although our main client was Epic, we discovered that the Shakira model has a great deal of military potential. During tests, when we upped the power to the 346's main generator, Shakira was able to melt a block of solid copper with the sound. Also, her hair covering can be used as a very effective anti-personnel weapon. We were surprised by this result.\\"    Although the jury is still out regarding Shakira's military potential, Epic is very pleased with their investment. Plans are in place to market this model heavily and more pairings with more cross-genre musical sound producers. One such possible pairing is with East Side Gat Studio's new sensation: Little HoodRat. We talked to Hoodrat's controller, Marshall Williams; he stated \\"YO, Lil Hoodie is da Bomb!! We gonna do a Boo-Ya take on 'Give It Up To Me' with more 'Uh-huh-huh-yeah', 'Yooooooo' and 'uh-uh-uh-uh-huyeah'. Keepin' it real! Yeeaaahh!!\\".    Quite so. Due to their continued success in the musical sound production field, Yu-San Corporation is now planning a joint venture with the Weyland-Yutani group. I can't wait to see what this partnership will produce..
B001FB4W0M|5.0|With the agonizing cliffhanger of season three's finale, I could not wait to see what the writers had in store for the fans in this season. Straight from the start they had us on the edge of our seats with the return of an uncertain character and the continuation of a great story. To be honest, I was a little worried after watching season 3. I was trying to figure out what they could do to keep me watching this show. The two main actors, Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, really work well together and keep this show fresh this season. I have always been a fan of the supernatural and spiritual warfare. This season really went above and beyond when it came to continuing the story while still giving us fun episodes. The fighting between the heavenly host and the love to hate 'em demons only made me love the direction of this season more. A few well placed plot twists, and even better episode ideas really made this season engaging. I cannot recommend this show enough. If you have not started watching this show yet, now is a great time if not the best time to start tuning in. It is much more interesting if you have followed the whole series since the season premiere is the extention of a cliffhanger, but its still more than interesting enough to start here if you do not want to go back and watch them all.
0061730327|5.0|Necessity is the mother of invention.<br /><br />Famine is not something many of us experience nor die from in many parts of the world but it still exists. To read about it from a personal perspective is enlightening. The book is full of a wealth of culture and education that I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to read. It is also a story of perseverance and persistence and the ability of man to take advantage of self guided learning despite poverty and the lack of formal education. Trial, error, and determination to continue to improve oneself and ones environment are the blessings the author encourages us to respect.<br /><br />Whatever life hands you, make the best of it regardless of what might discourage you from trying. Beautiful read.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|I didn't know quite what to expect from this little film called Doubt. I thought this film would be slow, boring, and preachy but to my surprise, this is one movie I plan on viewing again and again. Meryl Streep, Amy Adams, and Philip Seymour Hoffman all give powerful and seething performances. Doubt has serious subject matter but there are some quirky moments as well. So glad I watched this film, I highly recommend it!
0385504225|1.0|Please dont waste your time reading this book.  There is no plot or twist.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|I liked the movie, so I'm giving it 5 stars. It has some of the best animation I've ever seen. It's even superior to FF7: Advent Children, which I own on BD. That movie is phenomenal, but seeing Avatar in 3d showed me that computer animation has vastly improved in the past few years. I think this is a movie worth owning if only for the technological aspect of it. Some people find the plot boring, a rip off, too predictable, etc. I agree. However, I don't watch movies for complicated plot devices and intricate character development. You cannot get that in 90 or even 120 minutes. (The only movies I've seen that even come close is the Sci-Fi channel's miniseries adaptation of Dune and Children of Dune. Both of which I own in the director's cut version; they're over 5 hours long each.) If you want detailed plots and characters, read 19th century novels. If you want some entertainment and decent plot and character development done in a limited amount of time, movies are much better for that. Avatar is entertaining, beautiful to look at, and has a positive message about not destroying the place where we live. Is it shallow? No more than anything else coming out of Hollywood. I'd say it's better than most of the movies I've seen in theaters lately.     This version doesn't have special features. I don't like them because I never look at them anyway. I wish more BD were done without trailers, previews, forced ads and other junk. I hate having to watch ads on a product I buy. I can watch trailers on youtube. All of these things take up space on discs, often to the detriment of the AV quality of the movie.     This version will make use of the large disc size to have the best picture and audio quality available. Is this a possible marketing ploy? Maybe. If they make use of the entire 50gb available on a BD-50 disc, then it will be literally the highest quality picture and sound ever offered on BD. I've never seen another BD devote the entire 50gb to just the movie. We will see in a few days whether or not it's a marketing ploy. If they make full use of the disc like they claim they're doing, I will be completely satisfied with my purchase.    This movie comes bundled with a coupon to buy the Ultimate version coming out later, so I could sell this one in several months and buy that one at a discounted price. If you only want the BD and not the DVD, you can sell that too. You're getting a BD AND DVD copy for $20 along with a coupon to get the extended version. How this isn't a good deal is beyond me.    I don't see why people are complaining about the lack of extras. Amazon should remove the one star reviews that only talk about how this is \\"fake\\" or inferior because it doesn't have special features. I don't want special features, and my 5 stars are for the movie itself. If you want special features, wait until they're done. They haven't finished making them yet, so they'll be out in November, a mere 7 months away. You can buy the movie now or the movie and special features later. This is not double or triple dipping. I'm glad the studios have announced their intentions. In my mind this makes them honest for telling the truth about what they're doing. We are all now informed consumers, so buy whatever version you want. For those that complain people won't know this doesn't have special features, I imagine people like to read the movie's info online or on the back cover at the store before they purchase it. If people don't read and, consequently, buy the wrong version, they are at fault for not taking the time to inspect a product before purchasing it. If you want only the movie, like me, then buy this version.    Edit:   After watching the movie numerous times on my HDTV, I'm still blown away by how good the picture looks. It really is stunning.
0061125237|4.0|The Lion the, Witch, and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis was an exceptional book. Some parts were better than others but the outcome was an OK book. I think the characters were a bit dull. The author didn't really give them any personalities. Aslan, the great Lion, kind of swapped personalities at the end of the story from speaking bold and heroic to giddy and kiddish. Lewis had some nice detailed sentences and good descriptions but the way he presented people or how they acted was not very good to me. The idea of Narnia and all these mystical creatures was rich and good but the way he molded into a story was a way I wouldn't. I would recommend this to anyone who is hungry for an adventure or fantasy story but doesn't want to go through thick Harry Potters and Eragons. ~Katie C. DAIS
B003F1WM2K|5.0|A very kind young friend knew I was going to New York and pressed this book on me.  Stephen said that he hadn't planned to like it as much as he did.  I too felt ambivalent and probably wouldn't have read the book, only he was so adamant that I would like it, so I tossed it in my carry-on and spent the next five and a half hours high in the sky, sinking into Patti Smith's memories like a warm bath.<br /><br />I suppose she must have a certain amount of survivor's guilt, and it was strange to find out that as a child she had another little girlfriend who had polio, with an enormous pile of comic books and other beautiful things, and Patti kept something precious after the girl died, by just never giving it back.  Similarly she treasures the things that Robert Mapplethorpe left her--or that she wound up with.  She seems to have a wonderfully vivid memory for details--all the tschotchkes she and Robert accumulated, the details of every item of clothing, hats, shoes, each wore.  I thought of them as a pair of magpies, picking up (or picking up on) everything bright and sparkly--or dirty and dangerous in Robert's case.  Smith presents herself as a totally postmodern simulacrum of an artist, an amalgam of Rimbaud, Jagger, Joplin, Genet, every romantic artist she ever read about or sniffed out.  I guess she might have turned out awful, but somehow this combination of borrowed traits produced a uniquely arresting musician and songwriter, many of whose songs still sound fresh today.<br /><br />Finally we find out the truth about her love affairs with Sam Shepard, Todd Rundgren, Jim Carroll, Allen Lanier, and with Mapplethorpe himself.  In this touching memoir she writes with both gravity and humor about her hard times and, when Robert gets AIDS, she is genuinely startled, as if finally in the presence of the great mystery she had chased for thirty years or more.<br /><br />I hope she writes a followup book that explains the other great lacunae of her life, why she quit at the top and retired to become a married lady.  It's none of our business I suppose, but her disappearance into Detroit doomed thousands and thousands of fans into a whole decade of head scratching and lamentation.  (And when she came back, she wasn't really herself again.)ome a married lady.

B0039TD8LW|1.0|AC/DC has never been a band known for selling out but they do it here big time!<br /><br />Now I'm not naive enough to not realize that, these days, CDs are dead and you've got \\"spread the brand\\" and so on. But this album is totally absolutely pointless. Except as a cash grab.<br /><br />As a long time fan I gave them the benefit of the doubt because the album was not a greatest hits package, it didn't have a single new song to entice fans with a library of CDs to buy songs they already have. And, most importantly, the album served a second function as it tied into the Iron Man 2 movie.<br /><br />WELL, IT DOESN'T!<br /><br />You hear 2 and only 2 of the 15 SONGS on this CD in the film! Shoot To Thrill at the very beginning. Highway to Hell over the end credits! AND THAT'S IT!<br /><br />Let me repeat, YOU WON'T HERE THESE SONGS IN THE FILM!<br /><br />This renders this \\"tie-in\\" nothing BUT a cash grab and I thought the band was better than this. I wonder, actually, how associating themselves with a movie they are not part of even helps \\"spread the brand\\". As you don't hear the songs in the movie, folks are not likely to come out of the theater humming any of them. This rip-off could just as well have been called AC/DC Avatar or AC/DC Shrek. There is no blending of anything here.<br /><br />Cheap, rip-off, cash grab... terms I never thought I'd associate with  my favorite band.<br /><br />So, if you're a long time fan, you don't need this album. If you're an Iron Man fan, you don't need this album. Bottom line, unless you've always been curious about the band and want to pay to hear songs you can hear free on youtube, then shell out the big bucks and listen away.<br /><br />Great songs! Cheap gimmick!
B0034JKZ86|5.0|My daughter and the family loves this cartoon. It brings me back to the original Disney cartoons rather than all the computer animated stuff they have been doing lately. It will be known as a classic disney film. I wish they would make more cartoons like this.
B00275EGWY|1.0|Early on, I read the praise of multiple reviewers in Seattle, so I went to the limited-release showing of THL witha friend. We were both terribly disappointed.  Perhaps Bigelow's direction is good, I don't know; the script however, is ridiculous, as is (therefore) the praise it gets.  Would a \\"Lethal Weapon\\" movie be called an 'honest look at a cop's life'? Would anyone seriously describe a \\"Die Hard\\" film as gritty and realistic? Of course not.  The actions of the main character are beyond unbelievable, they're farcical: This guy is a bomb-defuser who faces no repercussions for his constant disobedience and insubordination; his refusal to follow protocols and obey commands indicate he's losing touch and becoming cavalier about his life, existing on the rush of walking the razor's edge over death. But they also depict someone who would have long ago run afoul of superiors, and if not been demoted and punished, then discharged from the Army.  To avoid spoiling scenes and events (though I'd be doing you a favor), I'll just remind you that nobody would consider it great filmmaking to have Arnold dodge bullets in a charge toward his enemies, then deliver a catch-phrase before landing a knockout punch to the bad guy. On the other hand, when this character does equivalently surreal and fantastic things throughout this movie, it challenges credibility and deteriorates the whole of the film - but this apparently strikes critics as terrific art.  At least \\"Kick-Ass\\" is tongue-in-cheek and not pretending or hoping to be considered realistic.

1400052173|5.0|This book was recommended by a nurse at my book club and at first, I thought it would be dry and uninteresting. I mean how interesting could a story about cells really be? But this author totally surprised me. She effectively wove together the story of Henrietta Lacks and her family with the scientific/medical aspect of cell harvesting and testing. Well done! Usually I do not enjoy books that continually swap back and forth between history and current times but Ms. Skloot did a great job at not letting those transitions become distracting. The story alone is engaging and the writing really complemented it. I think Mrs. Lacks would be proud of the way this author handled this very sensitive and emotionally charged subject.

And the symbolism too - very cyclical - Dexter born of blood, his son now born of blood? What do you think?

B00127RAJY|4.0|I'll begin by saying that I bought this DVD because of Jillian's kick ass personality and the way she pushes the contestants on The Biggest Loser. I was hoping for the same type of drive for myself at home with this DVD and Jillian did not dissapppoint me. Just when I thought that the the moves were too difficult and felt like giving up, Jillian jumped right in there with the right words at the right time to help me hang in there a little longer.<br /><br />I managed to get through the Level 1 workout without stopping my second time through the movie. Although I had to stop to catch my breath the first time, I was able to finish. Today was my 5th consecutive day doing the DVD and I feel great. I feel myself getting stronger and stronger every day and I feel my butt, thighs, abs and shoulders becoming more toned.<br /><br />This is the first workout DVD I've purchased in nearly 10 years. I have been working out on cardio machines and using free weights for the past 6 months and after doing this DVD, I don't think I want to see another treadmill again. I did not weigh myself before beginning because my goal is to fit a size 14 (I'm currently an 18) and I'm more concerned with how I look and feel than what the scale says.<br /><br />I'm going to move on to level 2 next week and I'm excited about it. I've already watched the circuts to see what's in store and I know if anyone can get me through it - it's going to be Jillian.<br /><br />Oh yeah... I gave this DVD 4 stars out of 5 because the music is horrible, the cueing could stand to be a lot better and I cannot stand imaginary jump rope. I strongly urge any beginners to stretch their knees out well because I'm a runner and mine are killing me.
B002NWRMVS|4.0|Not all the songs are great but for the most part I really enjoy her voice and melodies.
B00328G4V6|5.0|My vinyl copy is nice and flat, excellent fidelity and noise free.  Recently auditioned at a Soundsmith turntable clinic. Side a accommodating Peter's BEAUTIFUL strain gauge cartridge.  NICE..... Content, it's Hendrix....and I'll NEVER get bored listening to him.
B0017I1FNK|5.0|After listening over and over to this album, and to her \\"Stumble Into Grace\\" album as well, I did something I have never done and never, ever contemplated doing. I wrote to Emmylou to thank her. Beth, my wife of 30 years, a partner and soul mate in every possible sense imaginable, passed away a little time ago. Music has carried me through the ordeal of her departure these past weeks, and during this time, these two albums by Emmylou Harris rose to crowd out all the other music I started listening to.     I like \\"All that You Have is Your Soul\\" somewhat, which others here have singled out. But to me it is a bit too remote and programmatic and does not do what most of the rest of these songs do for me -- which is cut down deep to the bone. There are four in particular that cover every possible thought about loss and death I have struggled with. \\"Take That Ride\\" -- directed to a \\"you\\" that at first you may assume is a man in her life, but is in fact God (\\"One of these days I'm gonna take that ride. There may be nothing on the other side.\\"); \\"Not Enough\\" -- as in even a lifetime would not be enough to have back with the partner she has lost (or mine); \\"Sailing Round the Room\\" and \\"Beyond the Great Divide.\\" Together, it's all therapy, or prayer, or something, and it blows me away.    I agree with those who did not like the \\"maudlin\\" characterization of this album. I do not need nor want maudlin. This album is tough as nails.
B00004RGUI|5.0|It is our second purchase. -we bought our first one 10yr ago and it is still our favorite.      There are millions of piano cds but this cd is the most beautiful one. The sound of water and birds are very peaceful and calm. I feel like I am standing in the middle of the forest, standing by the window watching raining....  I still use this to put my baby to sleep.  I sometimes just play this cd in a low volume and it is wonderful background music.
1439138311|5.0|This was a great read.  I loved the characters especially the Italians.  We read so little of them.  I have shared the book with friends and they enjoyed it very much.
B002E2M5IC|4.0|No surprise that this has so many generally querulous reviews here, as it's made for a pretty narrow audience. I found all sorts of reasons to not like it, in fact, but the sheer brilliance of the brothers Coen as filmmakers and writers is impossible to dismiss even here.<br /><br />Suffice to say, you've got a much better chance of appreciating this if you enjoy watching people suffer, a constant barrage of all things Jewish and suburban, or enjoy others' lack of enjoyment. This film is mainly focused on those three things, and while its constant and overloaded sense of irony is its saving grace, it's also just plain aggravating after a while. I don't much enjoy an excess of any of the above three categories, and if this had been made by anyone other than the Coens it would be two stars.<br /><br />But of course no one else could have made this, and certainly nowhere near as tightly. The acting is uniformly excellent, the set design and photography near-perfect, and the stoned bar mitzvah is certainly a unique scene (autobiographical?). It's also a mercifully short film--thanks for that!--and does contain a decent number of very funny moments. The kid who can't speak without using the f-bomb (we all knew one of them), Larry's laughably fake and duplicitous wife and \\"best friend\\", the selfishness disguised as religious piety and caring cultural awareness, and the spot-on recreations of suburban 1967, just before the hippie vibe hit America full on, are all well worth frequent chuckles. Yet there's also so much unhappiness suffusing almost every scene that unless you're in the mood for this sort of extremely dyspeptic humor, A Serious Man has a good chance of sending you into A Serious Bummer.<br /><br />But I'm pretty sure the Coens made this mainly to humor themselves, and as a touchstone for them to revel in as their days shrink in number. And who can deny them that pleasure? They've given us so many classics already, so let them have their fun. Just know that their fun is clearly not everyone else's, and in fact that seems to be the point here. I imagine that if one grew up in their world that this would be a masterpiece. One thing for sure: I'm deeply glad I didn't grow up in their world!<br /><br />And I guess that I'm glad they did, for that perspective has created some of the best celluloid art of the past two decades plus. That many fans don't love this one hardly puts a dent in the Coen oeuvre. One thing for sure: their next one will likely do an about face as usual, and in this case that's A Serious Relief.veryone else's, and in fact that seems to be the point here.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I tend to get bored pretty easy and need things to be switched up. I worked out with a trainer for about a year and that was great but couldn't continue to afford it. I like to do functional movements when i work out and include movements that remind me of playing as a child but are also effective. If you like a challenging workout, that incorporates somewhat playful movements, and variety then you will like this. There are two different levels or styles - Anita-style (easier, low-impact) and Natalie-style (high challenge more plyometric). Within each move in each circuit you can vary the intensity by adopting whichever style you are capable of or scaling yourself back to the easier style if it gets to hard. In addition, I like to vary the dumbbell weights. On the videos they keep the same light weights throughout but I take the initiative to up the weights if the lighter weights aren't challenging and scale back when I need to. Jillian doesn't really say whether you should work up to Natalie-style before moving on to Level 2 but I chose not to. After about 10 days, I was getting bored and I was able to make it through Level 1 without stopping (but not at the high intensity of Natalie). I went on up to level 2 to beat my boredom and have been doing it for the most part at the lower intensity although some moves I can do at the higher intensity level. I anticipate being able to cycle back through the levels after completing level 3. I can see this video being a permanent fixture in my life b/c it's short, offers variety and leaves room for a bit of personal tweaking based on your personality. I do stretch a bit longer afterwards though, too. I think the stretches done in the video are very minimal and I need more. I will say that if you are someone who doesn't feel that they are getting a workout unless they do like 60 reps then this is not for you. Everything is based on time not the number of reps. You work at your own pace without stopping for the alotted amount of time. Generally, i am able to keep my reps up w/the girls in the video but if not that's one more thing to work up to. The important thing is form not number of reps. and not stopping. Oh, regarding what some really want to know - i am on day 12 - my body fat percentage has dropped by 7%, my total pounds are the same, but I was able to wear a pair of pants comfortably a couple of days ago that I have not been able to button in over a year. I am seeing results in the structure of my body but the pounds haven't dropped yet but based on the bodyfat percentage drop I think they will be soon :-}
B0036B8MZU|5.0|I feel sorry for those writing the holier-than-thou half-arsed-maybe-they-should stick-to-watching-Teletubbies review. As the Gladiators would say - pull stick out of arse. This show is pure entertainment. Good acting, and killer scenes, literally. For all those who LOVE high octane action and are not bothered by hot sex and scenes of blood and gore, this is for you! It's meant to be entertaining, and it surely is! I imagine alot more people love this show than they are letting on. (Yes YOU!) This show is about PASSION, LOVE, and most of all, REVENGE. The best show in a long time. John Hannah and Andy Whitfield certainly left their mark as two of the greatest actors on television so far. Buy the DVD!
B000MNP2K8|4.0|I never liked Bronson. I never liked him as an actor or as Bond. Though I did like his first three Bond films just never the actor. I didn't much care for his last Bond film either. But now we once again have a good film along with a good actor for the part - Daniel Craig in \\"Casino Royale\\"!<br /><br />I hate to say it, but Ian Fleming's novel \\"Casino Royale\\" was quite possibly his weakest Bond novel, but this film takes his novel and manages to be both faithful to it while also making it good. Apart from the beginning (which is great and action-packed), this film stays pretty close to the novel. The plot is pretty much the same except for a few miner details they HAD to change because of the times. The novel was written in the early 50s and this film is set in 2006. The James Bond character is much like Ian Fleming's Bond rather than the previous film versions that we've seen. And for the most part the film is action-packed and pretty exciting. And Bond once again has a meaningful relationship with the girl. The last time a Bond film tried that was in 1969's \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\".<br /><br />The only thing that hated about this film was that Vesper's and Bond's relationship goes on for too damn long before anything actually happens. It would have been fine if they cut out the scene where Bond and Vesper were on the beach because that scene was unnecessary and boring. If they had just left that scene out, this would have been the best Bond film yet.<br /><br />Never the less this was still a great and action-packed film.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I'm not going to lie....this is the workout from hell.    Jillian Michaels  will make you cry, especially if you don't exercise regularly...which I do not.  But, if you're looking for maximum benefit with the least amount of time dedication, this is it.  My entire body hurts, but I'm already seeing a major difference.
B001MUGDFI|5.0|Joanne Harris describes Vianne's chocolate creations with such eloquence I ate an entire bag of Hershey's kisses before I was halfway through the book.  It's that evocative and good.  It's not just the chocolate, though.  It's the characters, and the rain and the envious fear with which the priest Reynaud regards the appeal Vianne and La Celeste Praline have for the citizens of Lansquenet.  It's the way Harris describes the effects of the weather and tells little stories about Armande's red petticoat and Guillaume's dog and Vianne's own past.<br /><br />Like the finest confections, Chocolat is delicate and nuanced.  It's a parable of the battle between good and evil, though the good and evil aren't what you'd think.  It's about hypocracy and pretension and choosing what's really important.  It's also about friendship and character and family and there's a touch of magic in it, as well.<br /><br />Chocolat is a book to be enjoyed for its language as well as for its plot.  Reading it is like visiting an alternate, more delightful universe.  It's a great book for francophiles and foodies, though anyone would love it. I enjoyed the movie very much, but the book provides a much more vivid experience of Vianne's world.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I am a psychology grad student and what you could pick up from this show is incredible! The writers didn't just piece together plots out of nowhere when they had nothing better to do. The characters are all well developed and driven by the content over the years. Nothing is lost, everything, even characters that you have seen before are interwoven brilliantly from the beginning of the series up through the present, the sign of excellent writing! The best part about the production of this show is no film is wasted. You know how you watch 2nd rate shows or movies and there's absolutely no reason to have shown a scene, or they cut in the same useless scene later as if they don't have enough screenplay to make a typically-timed movie/show; that doesn't happen here! When there is a focus on a face the emotions are expertly carried by the characters from Sam & Dean to Jim & Cass. Even when they throw in a comical highlight or two it fits the characters perfectly. Now the music, hey I did my sentence of high school with most of the songs they use, which impresses me just as much as the lovely creaks, moans and groans of Dean's \\"Baby\\". This show is simply excellent and deserves so much more recognition than it gets, but most horror type genres are ignored as serious acting vehicles. Everyone should take a good or second-third-50th look at this series! -BB
B00328G4V6|5.0|This is superlative stuff....exceeds all expectations. Jimi Hendrix was a truly gifted individual always expanding the limits of expression....this has the unmistakable mark of Hendrix on it...each song is fresh as if it were recorded yesterday...beautiful stuff...very enjoyable....deserves more that 5 stars...
B00003CXXS|5.0|The first one: Classic. The second one: Pretty good. This one: A dino masterpiece filled with terrific animatronics and cgi. The tone of the movie is much darker than the first two but I find that it suits the movie. It also has breathtaking backgrounds and the fight between the Spinosaurus and the T-Rex was awesome it was good to see some fighting. I enjoyed this movie from start to finish especially with the help of Sam Niel returning who I think acted much better in this than the first. Full of suspense and exciting lines this is one not to be missed.

B0017HMF6W|5.0|I own this title on DVD and recently purchased the bluray version. The bluray version of this title is spectacular. It's like I was watching the movie again for the first time. Very sharp and colors seem more vivid than the DVD version. I'm glad I purchased the bluray version.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Fringe is the best TV show on the market. With an innovation of mystery, science, fantasy, and humor; this show ranks above #1. It is clearly the best. I get satisfaction from this show because every episode is like watching a movie, you get the beginning and then the end. However, there's any ongoing storyline and each TV show builds up more and more information. For those who want the answer know, concentrate on every second of the TV show, and find the clues. For those who are a bit lazy, the storyline is easy for follow and the characters are a blast.<br /><br />Yes, there's a ton of dead people, and disgusting sights, but I think that after the 10th episode, I had gotten used to it. The show is a blast, the characters are awesome. And the character development is awesome as well. I've never seen a show that concentrates so deeply on the characters.<br /><br />It is a Sci-FI, but I believe that the things mentioned in this show could be science fact. Probably a documentary. Speculation about if these Fringe mysteries existed, this is how they would turn out.<br /><br />The only con, the show is a bit dramatic! Alternative universe, going back in time, eternal youth! NO!!!!!!!!!!!
0441013597|5.0|One of the very best books written and THE best Sci Fi, hands down in my opinion.  This is a book that is important to the canon and a must read for anyone who reads seriously.  On a separate note, I find it hard to believe that formatting on the Kindle for this book is lacking.  It would seem there are a few books whose popularity combined with discerning readership that would merit special attention.  The fact that the Kindle dept can't get this one right is a head scratcher.  Note: I read this in book form; I discovered the formatting issue by reading other reviews.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I DON'T care.  I never watch that stuff.  Bare bones edition? GREAT!  Wonderful film!  Can't wait.
0143038419|4.0|Eat, Pray, Love is a book that gets so many mixed reviews and I believe that is for one simple reason: Timing.<br /><br />If you read this book at a time in your life when everything is peachy, and you have never experienced the heartbreaking effects of divorce or a major, life-altering event, you probably won't \\"get it\\".<br /><br />However, if you read Eat, Pray, Love at or around the time of a significant disruption in your life, prepare to realize that you are not alone. Some of Elizabeth's quotes are so dead on, that I would get chills. \\"Stop wearing your wishbone where your back ought to be\\" is definitely a worldwide favorite. Her honesty and no-bones-about-it, transparent writing is touching and makes you feel like she can empathize with you.<br /><br />Don't expect this book to be one that you can't put down because of a gripping plot or engaging mystery. It is in it's own class of self discovery and awareness of one's self. Read it - but read it at the \\"right\\" time.
B001VNVRVQ|5.0|I saw the movie of 'The Kite Runner' and loved it.  I decided to read the authors other book hoping to enjoy it also.  Of course  books are always better and this was a wonderful book.  The descriptions put me in the environment and I became involved with the characters.  It was one of those books you miss once finished.  If you appreciate a look into other cultures and the battles they have to deal with that we as an American take for granted, then you will enjoy this book incredibly.
B00005JNTX|1.0|This was the first movie that I've ever walked out on. I was fooled in to thinking that this was a great movie. I watched about ten minutes and just left. What I didn't like was just the bad acting and the long drawn out boreing begining. I can get over the cartoonish style as I loved 300 but this was just a horrible movie.
B002ZG983M|4.0|I saw this a few hours ago with some friends, and we all thought it was hilarious and incredibly bloody. I wasn't expecting too much, but I was pleasantly surprised. A dorky teen named Dave Lizewski begins wondering why people haven't decided to be real-life superheroes. When he buys a costume on the internet, he goes around and tries to help people and says that his name is 'Kick-Ass' He inspires Big Daddy and Hit-Girl to stop a drug dealer named Frank D'Amico. They soon decide to work with Kick-Ass because they are all on the same team. Will Kick-Ass, Big Daddy, and Hit-Girl be able to take down the powerful drug lord? I highly recommend KICK-ASS!!!
B00371XIP8|5.0|I love this movie! I do admit that I am late to the party because I had never heard of the boondock saints until I saw a preview of the release of boondock saints II on a movie I was watching. It looked like it was going to be good so I immediately ordered boondock saints I and pre-ordered II. I was not sorry. I love these two movies! In fact since my $200.00 dollar a month cable service has nothing on tv these days, that's all I do in my spare time is watch boondock saints one and two. I am in love with those guys! Sign me up for boondock saints III! It would be totally awesome to see where they take the story line next. Hopefully more killing and maybe we might get to see the boys get married and have their sons take over where they left off. I can dream can't I! I am soooo in love!!!
0307266303|5.0|McDougall blends a great story into an even greater message. I did not realize \\"Born to Run\\" would be as inspirational as it is, but now that I'm making the journey, I am so glad I invested in this book. I half expected \\"Born to Run\\" to be not much more than an anthropological study about people whom time forgot, but I was wrong. I'm a runner and I took a class in human evolution in college and all that jazz, so I've held a certain fascination for mankind's roots as runners. \\"Born to Run,\\" to be sure, scratches that itch. And yes, the commentary is woven into a ripping yarn, too.<br /><br />The welcome surprise is the heart for running and runners that McDougall possesses. If you're a George Sheehan fan, if you run for the sake of running, if you can't imagine your life without a morning jaunt around who knows where, then you'll find \\"Born to Run\\" neither a study nor a yarn but rather a book about the joy of running. It is this aspect of \\"Born to Run\\" that I value so much.
B000NA28I4|1.0|This travesty of a film looks like it was written and directed by the studio marketing department. The only things it has going for it are some utterly wasted A-list stars, some cartoonishly executed action sequences and special effects, and the name of a best-selling but apparently unrelated book as its title. The plot is disjointed and paper thin, the production values are wretched, there is no character development, and what plot there is advances almost entirely through poorly acted and ponderous exposition. The abysmal result could have perhaps been improved if the screenplay writers had made more than a token effort to draw on the rich source material available in the book that the movie takes its title from. As it is, the story presented in the movie is all but unrecognizable to those who have read the book. Departing from the source material isn't necessarily problematic when the result can stand on its own merits, but the excellence of the book makes the wretchedness of this at best tenuously related film stand out all the more. After about thirty minutes, I couldn't bear any more. I pulled the DVD out and resigned myself to trying to get back a little of the money I wasted by trading it in at the local movie store.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|The BBC's outstanding natural history track record is blighted in the American version of \\"Life\\" by a woeful narration by Oprah Winfery. The stunning visuals are stiffled by the queen of daytime's insufferable voice over, which sounds more appropriate for a copororate video on company sexual harrassment policy, or a supermarket's instructions on how employees should lift heavy boxes without injuring their backs. Winfery predicatbly elongates vowel sounds so that the fox's \\"long\\"journey home becomes the foxes \\"lo-o-o-ng\\" journey home, reducing what could have truly been a television event to a predictably tame, star driven, and, I hate to say it, dull wildlife program. Attenbougher of course would have lent authority to the narration without trampling all over the visual, even Signourney Weaver's cold delivery is better than Winferey's juvenile, Disney-eque wafflings.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|While I tend to gravitate toward the Tudor dynasty, this rendering of the story of the young Queen Victoria held my interest. The acting was...breathtaking. Simply superb. The scenery and costumes were flawless. I found the attention to Victoria's life before ascending the throne particularly interesting (usually glossed over in movies). Really, you can't go wrong with this one. Having enjoyed Mr. Friend's talents in Pride and Prejudice, I was thrilled to see him in The Young Victoria. He handled the role deftly and with a skilled touch. And Emily Blunt was simply phenomenal!

078513915X|4.0|I never read P&P - hey it's a girl thing you know. Also I never followed any TV serials on this topic either.<br />This comic is really cool. I finally get to discover some of the joys of this literature. Nicely abridged, this comic is quite well done. The front covers convey a very unusual \\"mod\\" look and I was expecting a 20th century dress version of this play. Surprisingly, the same drawings are nicely adapted to fit the social dress code of the 19th Century.<br /><br />The drawings are a little stilted at times and don't necessarily convey the emotions which should go with the dialogue. But overall, an enjoyable comic and certainly up to the usual Marvel standard of their recent Classics revamp comics.
B003405MF6|5.0|Tone. Taste. Touch.     And like I've said before about other more well-known or popular guitar players:    \\"Son, you're good, fast, a fretboard whiz, and hot lick soloist, but you ain't no Jeff Beck!\\"     Long Live Jeff Beck!
B002RT85RW|5.0|I have never found a bad media from TDK; in this case they surpass my expectation because those Blu-rays are able to record ton of data, music, 4 of 5 DVDs movies (all of them in just 1 BD) or a High Def Blu-ray movie. The extra benefit is the possibility of print on them without having to use a label.<br /><br />I order mine from HD CAMCORDERS (Fulfillment by Amazon) and got it in 3 days without paying for shipping (FREE SHIPPING offer by Amazon) that's really cool!!!!!!!!
0385523386|4.0|This book delivers exactly what I wanted to know about life in prison. And despite what the author said, Danbury sounds a bit easier then other places. And easier than I expected. I liked the book but not the author. It was only when she had nothing else to do, did she begin to look at the effect her actions had on others. And I am not talking about her friends & family. I find it hard to believe she never gave a thought prior to her arrest about drugs, poverty and the disadvantage. And I wonder how soon she will forget about them again since she has her freedom now. It is a good read .
0393072231|5.0|Returning to his roots writing about Big Finance, Michael Lewis has probably checked in with his best work to date. With a style more reminiscent of his debut, Liar's Poker, and his first blockbuster, Moneyball, than his softer follow-ups (The Blind Side, Home Game), The Big Short is an eminently readable and captivating picture of the 2007-08 financial crash. Told through the eyes of three of the only investors to to correctly predict and heavily bet on the crash in subprime mortgages, Lewis explains the madness that piled on top of insanity to bring about the greatest financial debacle of modern times. His narrative strands are coherent, if not always dramatic, functioning as the best kind of teaching tools to make the complex financial picture clear to an amateur reader. If there's any weak point, it's that Lewis doesn't find anyone to convincingly explain how Wall Street became so deceived by its own deception. But that's a minor complaint on a work that lays bare the unwitting conspiracy that brought down our economy. Required reading for anyone who owns or rents a home - or ever plans to - invests in any way - or ever plans to - or does any kind of business with a bank of any size. In short: everyone.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|While I thought Avatar was certainly enjoyable as a film, this DVD/BLU-RAY release of Avatar is very poor. The studio has quite deliberately not included any additional features or content, so that they can get people to buy a second \\"special edition\\" Avatar DVD/BLU-RAY at a later date. I recommend skipping this edition of Avatar completely. I may even skip the inevitable \\"special edition\\" because I'm so turned off by the studio's behavior.
B0018SJNZQ|3.0|Ugh.  I know, I know--Little Women is a classic.  I found the first chapters so incredibly dull that I skimmed them just to get to something interesting.  Then there are the sappy eye-roller moments--this is based on Pilgrim's Progress (which I have read), and it is a mix of the didactic and entertainment. So it is frequently preachy. But, to be fair, I just finished Wuthering Heights, which I found a real page turner. The comparison was too much, and I haven't touched LW in more than a week now. Just can't get interested.  On to Conrad or James...may be I'll come back and try it later. Marmie, Marmie, Marmie.  Who calls their mother that anyway? Maybe they all have speech impediments? Yech.
B001OQCV6A|1.0|My wife and I watched this movie and we really didn't care for. I don't know why Hollywood has to remake movie's and totally change the charcater and story .  I guess this movie would appeal to some but it didn't appeal to us.
B001992NUQ|5.0|FIGHT CLUB is one of those rare films that has warranted its huge cult following.  Whatever your opinion of the film  it delivers a wallop of intensity and thought-provoking drama in a way that follows no standard film stereotype of storytelling.  This film is very unique and one that many die-hard fans have been anxiously awaiting to see on blu-ray.  Well, here it is - with superb, unique packaging.  But was it worth the wait?  And is it worth a purchase if you have the dvd?  A resounding yes to both.<br /><br />When blu-ray is used to its fullest potential any film takes on a new life.  That is what happens here.  Everything that was intense intensifies - darks take new form, colors are vibrant.  There are many unique scenes and backdrops in this film.  On blu-ray  you see even more clearly what the director wanted to portray.  The 1080p/AVC-encoded transfer is a huge improvement from the dvd especially when it comes to overall clarity and color depth.  The audio is impeccable.  At times you can hear a pin drop and the expected explosions are so realistic you will be dumbfounded.  And all inbetween brings the film to a bigger reality.<br /><br />Fans rejoice.  Finally FIGHT CLUB can be seen in all its glory.  The impressive cast led by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter is astounding and the lead three give performances so creative, so unique and so intense that they rival the best in their careers.  The same is true for director David Fincher - this is truly his masterpiece.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie in any form but particularly on the superb blu-ray.  This film is so well done it is in no way dated.  One of the best films ever made shown to its greatest potential.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|The West Wing is the TV show where everything aligned to perfection. The performances are all sensational, and while no actor stands out, at the same time they all do. It is a peerless display of ensemble acting.    What tops even that, though, is the writing and in particular the dialogue, which is simply leagues ahead of anything that could even have the nerve to call itself competition. The fact is that The West Wing has no competition other than itself. With most shows we talk of peaks in terms of episodes (\\"episode 5 was the peak of that season\\"). In the case of The West Wing, we talk of peaks in terms of moments within shows. And there are literally hundreds of such moments. Hundreds. It would take another review just to mention a fraction of them.    Ironically, given that America is the land of individuality, the best TV show ever made is very much a team effort. A genius writer (until he left), some world-class actors and a production team who know exactly what they're doing, and the result is very simply a TV show which bears no comparison to any other. It's not just the best TV show ever made, it's the best TV show ever made by a mile.    In all honesty, there should have been an immediate ban on the writing of and production of TV shows the instant The West Wing ended. It is the alpha and omega of television as art and I am almost totally convinced that it will never be bettered.
B003ELOQD4|3.0|To everyone complaining about this being an incomplete show: every bleeding U2 concert is cut, one way or another, so what's the big deal about it? They are disrespectful of the concert going experince as a whole. I had my hopes moderately high about them leaping to Bluray but once again, they've done it.<br /><br />It's never been about media capacity, so I guess it's beacuse song copyrights, but this time they have edited out a U2 song? I would love to hear the reason why.
0545123267|3.0|Edward and Bella are living happily ever after, Stefan and Elena aren't back until next April, and you're looking for something else to fill that fluffy void in your reading life. Try Shiver. Like Twilight, and many of the supernatural teen romance books popping up, it's a quick read with instant gratification. Despite the less than stellar writing, readers will become instantly absorbed with the highly relatable Grace and Sam, and caught up in the twists of their impossible romance. Grace is Everygirl; a little OCD, a little shy, caught up in school and friends and parents until Sam shows up. Sam, of course, is a total hottie- an edgy, sensitive, transfiguring poet/musician. Though the theme of 'supernatural boyfriend will make nothing matter but the all-consuming love you have for each other' is a little worn, the interesting (and sequel-friendly!) subplot keeps the novel from getting too sappy. Though, who am I kidding? We read these books for the sap. Four stars for general giddy feelings post-reading, three for quality of writing.      Synopsis:  Sam is a mysterious teen werewolf whose presence has been haunting Grace since she was young. When Sam is forced into his human form by a bullet in the arm, he finds himself suddenly on Grace's porch and irrevocably in her life. Their mutual attraction is instant, brought on by years of an unspoken bond. But their happiness is short-lived, because Sam must live precariously between heat and cold, between man and wolf. In order to stay together, they must find a way to keep Sam human or he will be lost forever.

B0027BOL4G|4.0|The makers of \\"Food, Inc.\\" explained many of the scientific connections between industrial food and safety threats to consumers. They also illustrated the secrecy surrounding the food industry.     Like \\"The Cove,\\" the film makers exposed a food industry that could not sustain itself without government subsidies. Like \\"The Cove\\" did, \\"Food, Inc.\\" shows how government and industrial animal processors work together to hide the truth and to take away our right to choose safe and wholesome food.    However, the makers of \\"Food, Inc.\\" should have been more graphic in portraying the cruelty to animals. They should have made camouflaged, concealed cameras to make secret videos inside of the slaughterhouses, just like the makers of \\"The Cove\\" did.    Why are we so soft-spoken in criticizing America's brutal and ecologically detrimental beef/pork industry, while we are so aggressive in attacking the Japanese whale meat industry?
B001OQCV2O|2.0|I watch on avaerage over a movie a day, so I've seen a lot and I'm a fan of every genera if done well. This movie's only entertainment value(and the reason I didn't give it one star) is that you are entertained at how bad it is. In every scene they keep repeating the same concept, where the characters are trying to drive or fly away and the road is collapsing just behind them, missing them as buildings are falling in towards them and just missing them. They keep repeating this same concept and you're left thinking; \\"No way they used that again!\\" the whole movie. Then they get on these giant boats and someone says \\"where headed towards the face of Everest and if we don't get the engines started we're going to hit\\". Lol I can't imagine a more cheesy line. Lol Very dumb movie and not based on any actual science at all. It's very hard to suspend disbelief here. Actors were lackluster and pretty dull. This is one to miss unless you are looking for a horrible movie to watch, which admittedly sometimes I do. But once is enough for me on this one! :)

0393062430|3.0|Started reading this book but have yet to finish.  It started out to be very interesting, but about half way through, I started to get a bit bored.  I wasn't keeping my attention like the first chapters.  It is a good read though and I do recommend it to others.  Hope to finish reading the rest of it soon.  I'll update this review if my opinion changes.

B002ZG977Y|3.0|Never mind who stars in this film, never mind the score, the lighting...blah, blah, blah.  The overall journey is just a so-so experience, typical of any movie these days, typically full of fast action and CG everything.  There is no comparison to the original movie, which without a doubt, completely overshadows this remake.    My companion at the movie made the funniest comment towards the end of the film.  Perseus has just spent a long time in the ocean and under water, and in the very next scene, he is STILL covered in grime and dirt.  Nice continuity.  We had a laugh about that one.    Perhaps the brightest spot in the movie immediately turns into the most disappointing occurrence, when Perseus, just before setting out on his journey, picks up a gold owl, yes old Bu-bo from the original film, and the owl gets 3 seconds of fame once again, until Perseus asks, what is this?  He is told \\"leave it.\\"  Perseus sets it aside and we never see the owl again.  Pathetic.    There's a lot of action in this movie, and as a result, the overall story-tell is pretty lame.  I've seen many other reviews on this film, and without a doubt, they all say the same thing...\\"an okay film at best.\\"  Enough said.
B0019K06WM|5.0|It's very difficult to add anything more insightful to the many glowing reviews of this cd. But without hesitation I will say that here is a recording that, to my mind, is the equal to anything else recorded by CSNY collectively or individually.  The songs, the harmonies, the dreamy atmosphere that pervades the tracks combine to create a musical mystique rarely heard on record.  I purchased the cd based on all the positive reviews here on Amazon, so I knew that it had to be good - I just didn't know that it would be this good!  Prior to listening to \\"Graham Nash/David Crosby\\" my favorite side project to the CSNY machine was \\"Wind on the Water\\" but this record is simply a classic.  I can only wonder what it would have been like if Stephen Stills had been a part of it.  Based on the songs he was writing at the time (Manassas) it probably would have been better than Deja Vu.
B003A060K6|5.0|So you say you loved Andorra, but you don't trust Dan Snaith because the sneaker bugger never does the same thing twice? Good call. However, if Dan Snaith is known for anything, it should be for being able to live and breathe whatever musical genre he is currently digging. When he was heavy into dreamy '60s psych pop, we got the brilliance that is Andorra. Now, Snaith has been getting his groove on to dark electro dance music, and true to his craft, he has expertly synthesized what he knows and turned it into a fresh and unique take on the genre. First track \\"Odessa\\" happens to be both my favorite song on the album and simultaneously the most accessible one. I hope this doesn't reflect poorly on my cred. The rest of the album takes a darker, pulsing turn, with stretched out melodies belying very intricate production. With help from guys like Jeremy Greenspan of Junior Boys and Four Tet, you should expect no less. Yet another great album for 2010, hot damn.

0393072231|5.0|Michael Lewis does it again -- he has a clear knack for telling the human side of a story while revealing the inside details on a major issue. I only wish he could capture the personal side of the investment officials who were BUYING these securities, blindly (or not) accepting the rating of S&P and Moodys. I strongly suspect there was a lot of \\"herd instinct\\" buying that many would have preferred to avoid, but couldn't for a variety of reasons.     Personal note -- I was in charge of the investments for a Credit Union (which shall go unnamed) in the 90s when early versions of collateralized mortgage securities were first available. Despite pressure from our Board of Directors and President/CEO to purchase them, I refused. To me, it made no sense to take on the risk I felt they presented for a small bump in yield. End result? I was given a different job and replaced with someone who WOULD purchase them. Wouldn't surprise me if there are dozens of similar situations leading up to the events of 2008.
0312944926|4.0|Based upon how very little I'd heard about Dan Brown's two non-Robert Langdon books, I went into this one with very low expectations. However, Digital Fortress is a fairly well-written and entertaining novel. The main storyline is based upon a hush-hush operation within the NSA to obtain and or destroy the only existing copies of a pass-key that, if made public, could enable the use of an encryption program that would create coded messages that would be entirely unbreakable thereby rendering the NSA obsolete and allowing undecipherable communications between terrorist organizations and crime rings throughout the world. The storyline takes place mainly in two separate locations: the top two members of the encryption team trying to break the program and track down the pass-key from headquarters and in Spain where the search is on for any possible physical pass-key possessed by the recently deceased creator of the program.    This is a pretty fast-paced novel with lots of action on both fronts. As usual with a Dan Brown novel, things get a bit unbelievable at times, but that's what part of what makes them fun. He has created an interesting cast of characters and circumstances that really keep the storyline moving along at his usual break-neck pace. I had fun reading Digital Fortress and would recommend it to fans of Mr. Browns other works and also to those who enjoy thrillers along the lines of James Patterson if you haven't yet read any of Dan Brown's other works.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|Do not buy this version. If you want to watch the series, buy the David Attenborough narrated version from the BBC. David Attenborough has a 40yr long career writing, producing, presenting and narrating this type of documentary. He is a world-renowned expert in the field. I thought that Discovery would have realized their mistake when they used Sigourney Weaver for Planet Earth. Oprah's narration is 10 times worse, her narration makes what would be an amazing series nearly unwatchable.

0316017922|5.0|This book refutes the common belief that \\"hard work\\" is all it takes to succeed.    Time and again, Gladwell reveals how unique OPPORTUNITIES play a major role in the  remarkable success of anyone from a world class soccer player (highly dependent on how  early in the year they are born) to Bill Gates (highly dependent on the year he was born  and unlimited access to a computer terminal at an early age).    In a nutshell -- unique opportunity + hard work = success    The chapter on the impact of one's culture on the nature of the working relationship  between the pilot and first officer on commercial aircraft was fascinating.
0061537969|5.0|I am not sure what made me pick up this book unless it was the unusual cover.  I am NOT an animal lover.  But I was smitten with Enzo from page one!!  The story is about Enzo who is a dog and the narrarator of the story.  He is in poor health when the story opens and he is re-living his life with his master who is a race car driver.  He believes that when he dies, he will be re-born as a human.  He so wants to be a human that although you know it is impossible, you are hoping he will!  as humans.  You get a lot of insight as to how dogs think and see things.      A great read.  Although the ending is a little out there, I HIGHLY recommend this book.
B003B02PF4|5.0|A break from Grisham's familiar southern courtroom setting, The Broker is a mad dash across northern Italy. You will find yourself reading until the wee hours following Joel Backman's, one of Grisham's most intriguing characters, dangerous journey. this book is a pure rush and will leave you yelling for more. In my opinion, it's Grishams finest work
B001NXBRJG|5.0|If you haven't seen The Matrix yet, what world are you living in? This movie is awesome! The computer usage is dated (as are the cell phones) which is a common thing in films relying on technology, but the story, action and special effects hold up very well. Blu Ray is just an amazing format. If you don't have it, what are you waiting for? You can get a good player for a little over $100 (I paid $140 for mine which is a Sony S560, hope I got that right) but the quality is amazing.    With The Matrix you get a great version, almost an ultimate version with this 10th Anniversary. You won't need to buy another version unless if you are a hard-core fan. The extras are spectacular, though a little hard to access. I had problems getting to the main menu, it kept wanting to go to the movie, so there is my only complaint. As for the extras, there are so many features, 4 Commentaries, a feature-length documentary )The Matrix Revisited), Behind The Matrix Documentary Gallery (7 Featurettes!), Take The Red Pill Documentary Gallery (2 Featurettes), Follow The White Rabbit Documentary Gallery (9 Featurettes)The Music Revisited - 41 track audio selection with nearly 3 hours of music, Marilyn Manson Music Video, Theatrical Trailer & TV Spots.    All this and I haven't mentioned the Digi-book and the movie itself (quality-wise). There is some controversy about the Digi-book among geeks. Their complaint is that the book makes the Blu Ray package bigger than the standard Blu Ray size. It's a valid complaint. For those of you who don't know, standard Blu Ray boxes are about an inch smaller than standard DVD boxes, so the Digi-book edition here is about the size of a standard DVD. It sticks out in your Blu Ray storage (Book Shelf or whatever you use to store your Blu Rays). Now that being said, I think it's a bit making a mountain out of a molehill. Yes, it's a minor inconvienence but not worth all the complaint I have read about it.    As for the movie itself, The Matrix has never looked better than this. Never sounded better either. Some scenes to watch for is when they \\"rescue\\" Neo the vibrant colors really stand out. I have noticed that Lightning/electricity comes off really good on Blu Ray. In the original Terminator, the electric crackles in your speakers and seems to pop off your screen. In T2 & T3 the lightning effect is more realistic and thinner. It just looks and sounds so real and great, it's hard to describe. The same happens when Neo is disconnected before being flushed, when he looks around for the first time and sees the \\"real world\\" it is visually breath-taking.    So how do I feel about The Matrix 10th Anniversary Edition Blu Ray? It gets top notch recommendation. If you like Sci-fi, action, special effects, mystery or movies that make you think and gasp in awe of what you see, then this is a must-buy for you!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I have come to expect only the best from Pixar. The best styling, the best sound tracks, and of course, the best stories. From very early into the movie, I was crying freely, and copiously. I think that speaks strongly for the ability to tell a story: that you get drawn in so quickly, and care about the characters in no time flat. I'm going to have to watch it again a few more times to really catch all the hidden gems that Pixar will be sure to have scattered through it.<br /><br />Beautifully rendered art, beautiful story, and one that you can follow closely. Just be prepared with the tissues.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is a terrific movie.  Makes you feel good and cry good!  Once in awhile doing the right thing IS the right thing!  Great motivational movie for the whole family.
B003405MF6|5.0|I am a long time fan of Mr Beck, and apart from a few things on Flash, He has always delivered for me. I didn't know what was coming here, although I heard him in concert in February, and when the string section came out to set up I thought \\" this will be interesting\\". Beck does the utmost to appeal to a wide array of listeners here, from classic rock/blues like \\" you put a spell on me\\". to Puccini's \\" Nessun Dorma\\" He still rocks with the best of them, and for those that can't get enough of that, perhaps he will do an album just for you. But here are some beautiful moments, from \\"there's no other me \\" with  a great vocal from Joss Stone, to \\"Elegy for Dunkirk\\" ( he always includes an emotional end piece, ) variety is first and foremost .Even \\" Somewhere over the rainbow\\" which made me think hmm when I read the cd case, is a great vehicle for a master rock guitarist, He still is the man !
030726999X|5.0|Absolutely wonderful wrap-up to this crime fiction trilogy. The entire trilogy from The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo must be read to enjoy the full effects of this superior storytelling. Unfortunately I did not read the second book, The Girl Who Played with Fire. I am definitely going to read it. I had to assume several things because I missed this critical middle section by not reading the second book. The author does do an excellent job of filling in the back story without taking up too much time.<br />Coming in at 576 pages it is a tightly written, well executed story. Lisbeth Salander is one of the strongest main character portrayals I have read in a long time. It is unfortunate that this is the last book we will see from Larsson as the author is no longer living.<br />Unfortunately rehashing the plot gives away too much of the trilogy, but if you enjoy crime or spy novels, or just enjoy reading a well told story, this is the series for you.

B0035WTE2U|5.0|If they call it a Greatest Hits or Best of cd , then according to most record contracts the record company would then have the right to release their own compilations thus resulting in a compilation release every 2 - 3 years and have their catalogue bastardized much the same way as Aerosmith,Kiss and Iron Maiden's has.Everyone should know what songs are here before buying,if not that would be your own stupidity then.I have no use for this,but someone not owning all AC DC's releases would enjoy this.Compilation releases are aimed at people not owning the whole catalogue.Thank God they didn't ADD the one \\"obligatory\\" new song usually added to compilations trying to get fans with evrything already to by it.
B0012GMVVW|5.0|Not much to say about this album, except that it's great. This is the old Bowie here. 5:15 The Angels Have Gone is quite a good song, but the album is actually really solid throughout, musically very interesting and always assured. It's just a fact that Bowie doesn't inspire the same sort of nostalgia that, say, the Rolling Stones do. The Stones have been making garbage for decades and selling it to Baby Boomers who still remember them as the band that did Exile on Main Street. Bowie's output post-Tin Machine has actually been pretty good, but apparently people aren't noticing. That's just how life works out sometimes. It's a shame.    My point is that Bowie is not some nostalgia act. He's still a great craftsman who is still invested in putting out a good product. Check out the album. You will not be sorry.
0618918248|1.0|Full disclosure: I am LDS (Mormon) and I find all of the answers in my faith that explain the questions that seem to make Dawkins an atheist.    1. Why are there many gods throughout history and various cultures? It is a form of \\"patternism,\\" diffused traditions and archetypes that all point to the same god ultimately. Read the work of Hugh Nibley on Semitic, Egyptian and Hellenistic myth, ritual and history and you will find striking parallels. We are finding this pattern as far away as Hopi Indians in the Western US.    2. The problem of evil (an atheist favorite). Traditional Christians will not provide this answer. Latter-day Saints teach that like matter and energy (E=MC2), human intelligence is eternal and was not created by God. We are as old as God is, just in a less developed state. God does not really create anything. He organizes existing elements. Order from chaos. We are eternal entities. Also, each individual is autonomous and free to choose for itself. The purpose of life here is to give us opportunity to advance in knowledge. The Earth was created by God to give us a type of university where free agency reigns supreme. a place of probation to see if we will do all the things that God commands us in preparation for higher places. People may commit heinous evil and God has given us the gift of not interferring. Those who progress by degree will be compatible for higher states (this teaching is the archaic root of reincarnation, only LDS teach that in all of this we retain our individual identities and consciousness.)     All are free to act as they please, for good or evil. Because our intelligence and root identity was not created by God we are not \\"programmed\\" or \\"designed\\" to behave a certain way. Therefore, God did not will evil into the world. Rather, he permits us to gain further light and knowledge by learning to differentiate the light from the darkness for ourselves. Also, as death is merely am intellectual re-birth into other worlds the insidious view of it is really a limited fear of the unknown from our veiled perspective here. Veiled because any state of testing and probation must be without knowledge of past or future existence to be effective.     The endless cosmos are packed with worlds without end. Hubble deep space field gives us just a slice. As LDS teach, there are many spaces, regions, places, degrees and heavens. Each different. A place for every type of person in the physical universe. Some hold that perhaps God operates in this galaxy only and that there are like beings scattered throughout the cosmos, each with their own progeny and creations. We believe that mankind was created in the literal image and likeness of God. He being our father. The purpose of Earth life is to prepare us to ultimately learn to become like him, learning the methods for controlling matter and energy and creating worlds and progeny. There is much said about this in the early Jewish and Christian apocrypha. For a fascinating look at this ancient literature which has been popping up all over the world, corraborating each other, read this article on LDS, Jewish and early Christian cosmology:    [...]    If this sounds unrealistic I remind you that we are floating on an orb in an immense blackness (blacker than you can imagine) surrounded by more galaxies than there are grains of beach sand on Earth. I submit that Dawkins knows nothing beyond the hopes and fears of a lonely, isolated, quarantined, planet of learning and probation. Just remember that you lived before your came to Earth. You are eternal and Earth is a dot

B0018QQQK8|5.0|I have become a big fan of nicholas Sparks. After reading Dear John and the last song..Now im starting to try and read every book he has written. The lucky one was an excellent read...I just could not wait to pick up this book and carry on reading and had to finish it.. the last few chapters kept me up pretty late as I had to find out how this wonderful story would end.. Nicholas did not dissapoint he is a great writer. The ending was very intense and I must admit I had tears as always when you read a sparks book... But the story line was wonderful getting to know all the characters. Logan, an ex marine who finds a picture of a girl and somehow believes it brings him luck...and goes on a journey to find her after leaving the marines..they are a few twists in the story along Logans journey... some good, some sad... Beth, Nana, Ben and Clayton are all good characters...and Vincent who told him to go look for this girl to thank her for bringing him luck...but the ending had me gripped and after I had finished reading this story, The next day writting this review I am still picturing the last few chapters in my head...Now I can start reading my next Nicholas Sparks book... The Choice..I wonder where this will lead me......
0307454541|4.0|So after the first 100 pages that I found quite \\"wordy\\" I got totally hooked into the whole mystery.  I was going to put it down but right around 100 is where the story begins.  Unfortunately, I found the same to be true of the last 60 pages.  It almost seems like the book won't end.  So from 100 to 550 (i think the book is 600 pages) was EXCELLENT.  The rest is just too long.
0790729393|4.0|\\"Sleepers\\" is a gripping drama of four teenage boys growing up together in Hell's Kitchen, New York.  The beginning of the film is set in 1967 and they are happy-go-lucky, yet somewhat careless and unthinking with some of their pranks.  They are always looking for some excitement and one day their prank changes their lives forever.  When playing games to get free hot dogs, a vendor's cart unexpectedly is set loose down subway stairs and a man is killed.  The boys are given a \\"lenient\\" sentence to serve at the Wilkinson School for Boys, since Father Bobby (Robert De Niro), the neighborhood priest puts in a good word for them.  The home turns out to be a nightmare where they are raped and tortured by four guards.  Noles (Kevin Bacon) is the worst and the ringleader of the group.<br /><br />Fifteen years later, the boys, now men, Shakes (Jason Patrick), Michael (Brad Pitt)l, Tommy (Billy Crudrup), and John (Ron Edard) come together under the same judicial system that was supposed to protect them, but failed.  They are still dealing with the memories and psychological issues surrounding the tortures and sadistic rapes.  Tommy and John are now criminals and they happen to see Noles at a local bar.  Noles is now a security guard eating by himself, so Tommy and John shoot him in front of a few patrons and leave the bar, soon to be arrested and brought to trial.<br /><br />Shakes is now a newspaper reporter and Michael is a lawyer with the district attorneys office.  They want to save their two childhood friends, while keeping the secret of their friendship and times at Wilkerson together.<br /><br />An alcoholic lawyer (Dustin Hoffman) from Hell's Kitchen is hired to prosecute the case.  Father Bobby is entwined in the plot for retribution as the story unfolds.<br /><br />Overall \\"Sleepers\\" is a very powerful and gripping story that gives the victims one last chance to use the judicial system that failed them for revenge.
B00004RF8J|5.0|Who thought a 60s B-film by Roger Corman could be adapted into a successful Broadway musical? And who would have guessed that the said musical would be filmed to make a true `80s cult classic?  Surprisingly, almost everything about this film works. The plant himself looks pretty cool and his movements are realistic. He has several funny one-liners throughout the film, not to mention some memorable singing parts. His rough voice (which is oddly reminiscent of a black soul singer) was provided by Levi Stubbs of the Four Tops.   Whoever did the casting for this film was a true genius-Rick Moranis was born to play the nerdy florist Seymour, and Ellen Greene's lisp and high-pitched voice make her perfect for his romantic interest, Audrey. This film also features Steve Martin as a sadistic dentist and Bill Murray as his all-too willing patient. John Candy is hilarious as the talk show host ''Wink Wilkinson.''  And lest we forget the Greek chorus line which appears in several of the musical numbers-they're good enough to have their own musical. Heck, even the homeless bums who sing during ''Skid Row'' are talented.  The songs, which are all done in the style of earky 60s rock and roll, have catchy melodies and clever lyrics. (Seymour: I have so many strong reservations/Should I go and perform mutilations?) Stand out numbers include the darkly funny ''Dentist!'' and wonderfully over-the-top ''Suddenly, Seymour'' (who knew Rick Moranis could sing?)  I, for one, am glad they gave this film a happy ending (as opposed to the original version.) It somehow makes the rest of the film seem more good-natured and light-hearted.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the movie and from what I've heard most of it is (with some poetic license, I'm sure) very close to true other than that Michael Oher had some football experience prior to meeting the Touhy's.    Well worth watching and owning.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|I always see the t-shirts that say \\"give blood, play rugby\\", so I was aware that the sport was violent. This movie helped me see that there is the potential for leadership within in this sport. This movie does a great job illustrating the manner in which one group of rugby players confronted radical change within their own country and became better individuals for having confronted that change. The movie shows how they responded to the change and why it mattered for all those within South Africa at the time. They were not angles, but men who rose to the challenge put before them. All in all, a very good movie that will challenge your assumptions about the possibility of change among people.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is a story of a Japanese dog that becomes lost at a U.S. train station, and is taken home and adopted by Professor Richard Gere. Hachi walks to the train station every morning with Gere, then goes home and waits for Gere's return at 5:00 P.M. Then Hachi returns to the station and waits for him. Gere unexpectedly dies, and Hachi continues to wait for Gere - every evening for the next nine years while living in a rail yard and getting free food from nearby vendors. The story is an adaptation of a true story that occurred in Japan, where a monument was erected to the dog.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|When this headset works, I'm very happy with it.    But frequently there is sudden, ceaseless crackling and popping that causes me pain.  It's like someone setting off fireworks in the next room.  Not only is it uncomfortable, it's very stressful, and ruins my gaming experience, as it's impossible to be immersed in the game.    I've looked for fixes, there are none.  I can turn off my own wireless router, but I can't do anything about other tenants wireless.  I was able to reduce the frequency of the crackle/popping by turning down the input level on the transmitter.  That helped enough that I held on to the headset longer than I should, giving it another few chances with several replacements of fresh batteries.    I missed my return window by 2 days, as I was not diligent in sending it back to Amazon, unfortunately.  Now I'm stuck with a very expensive paper weight.    I'll still allow the product 3 stars, as I LOVE it when it works.  I love the sound quality, and the dual chat/voice controls.    UPDATE:  I like that Amazon allows you to update the stars if you edit you're review.  Nice feature.    I won't change it to 5 stars, but I managed to solve the continual crackling and popping by placing the wireless router behind my PC, which is somehow shielding some of the RF that was wreaking havoc with my headset.  I can still have wireless internet on the laptop next to me while wearing the headset, so I'm happy.  The quality is just fantastic, and I'd give it 5 stars if I didn't have to hide my router to keep the headset from being completely unusable.

B0031OCY2E|3.0|Lets just get to the review. The movie was funny, not laugh out loud funny, but funny. The main thing I have against the movie is that it just drug on in parts for no real reason. I think it was filmed this way to show how crazy the main character was, but that does not translate into a real sound reason for reflecting such a fact in the movie. The end result was that this thing drug on for too long in a number of spots. So, it was just alright in its filming, and acting. What a disappointment.
0618526412|5.0|I have such a connection to Carson McCullers and her work and it is difficult for me to pick a favorite, but this one just resonates.  I loved \\"Reflections in a Golden Eye\\" and \\"Clock Without Hands\\".  McCullers knows about outsiders because she was one, and used that experience to inform her writing.  Similar to \\"Member of the Wedding\\", this novel has a tomboyish young lady who can't quite articulate her dissatisfaction with life and relationships.  Each character is stricken with an irrepressible desperation and isolation.  Anyone can relate to this novel.  Only wish there were more undiscovered McCullers novels in a trunk somewhere...
B0037W68F4|5.0|I just love MGMT's music and their new album is great. You get a combination of psychadellic, strange and haunting songs that are a nice throwback to the 1960s/70s. I've listened to the album multiple times now and each time I appreciate it more.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|Saying this is an inferior release simply because it doesn't have extra's is kind of stupid.  When's the last time you seriously watched 'out takes' or any of the extra crap that drives up the price of a DVD more than once?  I've seen the 'extra' stuff on various DVD's I own a grand total of:    ONE TIME    So if I can get the movie, that I watched and enjoyed in the theater for 20 bucks, then WHO FREAKING CARES.    And as for 'deleted or extra scenes'  Tell me how many of those, after you see them, did you sit there and go 'Man that should have been in the movie!!'  Most of them are utter garbage and are best served by being on the cutting room floor.      I can guarantee one thing - If James Cameron wanted them in there, he would have left them in there because he has enough clout to have the movie be 6 hours and still release the stinking thing.  It was cut FOR A REASON you simpletons.      And as for someone crying about 3D versions.  Have you seen a 3D tv yet?  They are complete trash.  Like I'm going to sit on my couch like some sort of homotron wearing glasses and straining my eyes whenever I want to watch it.      I'm liking that this blu ray is 20 dollars.  Reasonable price for a reasonable movie.  If you insist on smearing yourself in peanut butter while watching extra footage that was CUT FOR A REASON, then knock yourself out and buy in November.    So enough with the tears and the 'warning the general public'.  I think most of you need to get back to your L.A.R.P. groups, hold hands, then go jump off a cliff.
B002IVLH60|4.0|It's Nice to see PEARL JAM put out two solid back to back albums over the past couple of years.

Long live Pearl Jam.
0767817478|1.0|I'm a huge movie buff. I've seen thousands of films--the good, the bad and the ugly. But I've walked out of only one. This one! The script is drivel and the acting is putrid. It neither believable, nor campy. Just a ridiculous mess. Avoid this like the plague. Just look at the number of one star reviews it's gotten here. And I gave it one because there was no lower rating allowed. It deserves a negative 5! Please don't patronize this crap!

B000002B49|5.0|This absolutely perfect collection of songs turns 15 years old this year. Ah, time passes so quickly. In that time, there has been nothing, absolutely *nothing* that has held a candle to \\"Boheme\\", and it's doubtful that anything like it will ever come along again.    This album is, as I've stated, utter, all-ncompassing PERFECTION. Every song, from beginning to end is flawless.    I've been a fan of Deep Forest since the self-titled debut. That album was insanely brilliant, but when \\"Boheme\\" was released in 1995, my perception of music was altered forever.     The album opens with the moody \\"Anasthasia\\". This song starts the album off in a fairly dark place, but although it acts as somewhat of an intro track to the album, it stands in its own right. The dark mood of \\"Anasthasia\\" breaks, and we hear an almost jubilant hand-clapping as the masterpiece that is \\"Bohemian Ballet\\" begins. This is the song that truly sets the tone for the rest of the album. While the track is very upbeat, it does have tones of the darkness from \\"Anasthasia\\".     Which brings us to \\"Marta's Song\\". This is one of those songs that worms its way into your soul, grabs you and just won't ever let go. The song is mournful, melodic, completely inspired. When the song hits its mid-point, just when you think you can't emotionally handle more of the gorgeous ache that Marta Sebestyen's voice conjures up in you, you are nearly reduced to blubbering tears when the instrumental break happens and out of nowhere, an electric violin bursts through your head, knocks you on the ground and pulls the breath right out of your body. Easily one of my all-time favorite songs.    \\"Gathering\\" continues the emotional journey. We are introduced to a new voice here. It's male (I think), but sounds almost androgynous. This song is another mournful dollup of sonic whipped cream, and is relentless in its beauty.     \\"Lament\\" brings us to nearly the middle of the album, and is a culmination of the sadness that marks the first half of this album. The title of the track explains the song beautifully. The vocalist is again male, but not the same voice we heard in \\"Gathering\\". This one is more dense and literally makes you almost ache with the sadness he is singing about.     \\"Bulgarian Melody\\" is what I would call a more traditional-sounding song, and features a delicate and beautiful piano arrangement backing Marta Sebestyen.     \\"Deep Folk Song\\" is again really traditional-sounding, and features a lively accordion solo. It's short, but acts as a bit of a transitional track, setting the mood for the remainder of the album.     \\"Freedom Cry\\" is jubilant and triumphant. The song features the same distinct male vocalist from \\"Lament\\", but \\"Freedom Cry\\" is in direct contrast to \\"Lament\\". It's one of those songs that just makes you feel warm on the inside. I particularly like the drum loop in this one.    Okay, now we continue the journey into one of the two major standout tracks on the album. \\"Twosome\\" is a duet and it is remarkably beautiful. There is a driving beat behind the exotic vocals and traditional chants. The vocals weave in and out of each other endlessly. This song easily ranks as high as \\"Marta's Song\\".     \\"Cafe Europa\\" is the next track. This song is more uptempo and has more driving club beats behind it. It's probably the album's most fevered pitch and is quick, complex and beautiful.    \\"Katharina\\" is what I would call a 'resting phase' after we come out of \\"Cafe Europa\\". The song is laid back and beautiful and reminds me of mid-spring when the trees begin to bud. There is some melancholy here, but not enough to take away the light mood.    The final track of the album is the title track, \\"Boheme\\". This song encompasses every single element from the previous 11 songs. To me it's almost a mashup of all the songs on the album, and there couldn't possibly have been a better way to close out the journey.     I won't say much more about this because I could gush for hours. AllI'll say is this: If you haven't experienced this record yet, do yourself a favor and get it. That's all.
B001V7R09A|5.0|Years ago I bought three of these LPs.  NO ONE plays the Rachmaninov preludes as well.  I heard a live performance recording by Richter himself of the G mi. prelude, but I simply liked the DGG studio recording better.  Artists insist that they don't play their best for studio recordings, but in this one Richter pulls all stops.  When passages call for thunder, he plays without inhibition.  On the other hand, the D Maj. prelude couldn't be more lyrical.  This 9-CD set is worth the money for these six preludes alone, yet I got 9 new CDs for far less than 9 LPs would have cost decades ago.    I do not find the sound quality poor.  The original recording technology was quite advanced, and the digital transfer is satisfactory at worst.  Disc 9 is of live performances.  Some coughing is inevitable, but this audience must have been suffering from an influenza epidemic.  What a pity, for I have never heard more sensitive, UNpedantic Bach playing.  Fortunately, the couging is minimal during the Rachmaninov G# mi. prelude, and that's the best piece on this CD.    I had already bought two separate CD reissues of Richter's DGG LPs:  concerti by Mozart, Beethoven, Rachmaninov, and Tchaikovsky.  I'll donate them to a school.  To others who may have already bought separate DGG CDs of Richter I recommend doing likewise--donate them and replace them with the complete set.  Youngsters need to be exposed not only to good music, but also to quality interpretations.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|I first heard about this CD on NPR and was intrigued. After listening to both CDs several times through, all  I can say is if Natalie Merchant does not win a Grammy for this work - then I will be extremely disappointed!!  What a project she took on and what results! There is something for everyone on here - from Zydaco to Blues, even Native American. The packaging - with the lyrics to the poems and short biography of each poet is a treasure and no doubt many of us will be doing further research on these poets.  I have always been fascinated with her voice and musical styles - but this outdoes everything!  I have just ordered 2 more copies as gifts for friends.  \\" Leave Your Sleep \\" will be on my top 5 CD list for years to come, I'm sure!

B002VECM4A|3.0|Depressing and upsetting beyond belief but I kept watching hynotized.  Precious was very lucky in that someone found her to help her.  There are millions of girls like Precious suffering through very similar circumstances and very few get that \\"certain someone\\" to pull them through.  Some do it on their own and some need help but most do not get through it.  Society has too little resources to help those suffering; too much of our taxpayer moneys goes to foreign aid (maybe the US should file for foreign aid); two useless wars, corruption and waste in Congress and military to spend the money to look after our children.  This should be a wakeup call to all Americans to fight back at Congress to failing to help and protect the taxpayers.  But the apathy of the American public is even more depressing than this picture.

031606792X|4.0|I have to admit, I did look at the reviews and knew most of the spoilers for the book before I read it.  I read all 4 books in a month.  I could not put them down.  I am a 35 year old mom of 2.  I think you either love Edward or hate him.  I love him because I long for my husband to be just like him, if you are not someone who would long for a marriage like theirs, you won't like him or the book most likely.     I was confused on why Stephanie would add so many characters at the end of book 4.  Why not include them thru the whole series?  30 new vampires in the last 100 pages?  It took me twice as long to read the last 100 pages as it did to read the whole book.  Maybe this is a set up for more books to come. (as she already has one coming out in June for a spin off of Bree Tanner).      All in all, I think people are pretty hard on the author, it keeps people reading, of all ages, and I love that it is a light read.     I will be giving the series to other friends, I think they are worth the read.

B002ZG977Y|2.0|The more I think about the new \\"Clash of the Titans\\", the more ticked off I get. Shortly after it became apparent that \\"Avatar\\" would become a huge success, breaking box office records, Warner Brothers decided to make a change to \\"Clash of the Titans\\", their big budget remake of the 1981 cult favorite. Their new version, starring Sam Worthngton (also in \\"Avatar\\") was scheduled for release over the last weekend of March. But a large reason for the phenomenal success of \\"Avatar\\" is the premium charged for the 3-D screenings. Most theaters charge $5 extra for the glasses at a 3-D screening. A very significant portion of the tickets sold for the James Cameron phenomenon were for 3-D or IMAX screenings, pumping up the box office totals. Warner Brothers decided to 'retrofit' \\"Clash of the Titans\\", a film already completed in 2-D, for 3-D screenings. They found out the bare minimum of time it would take and pushed back their release date one week, so they wouldn't have to compete with Dreamworks' animated \\"How To Train Your Dragon\\", also a big (and better) 3-D release. I was one of the first people to rush to the theaters to see \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" when it was re-released in 3-D, so I figured this retrofit would be acceptable.<br /><br />I figured wrong.<br /><br />\\"Clash of the Titans\\" is never going to be considered a great film, either version. Film enthusiasts remember the 1981 version as a late example of the great Ray Harryhausen's work. Harryhausen was a stop motion animator who created creatures and effects for a number of films like \\"Jason and the Argonauts\\" and \\"The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad\\". The story is too inherently campy, historically inaccurate and the films are filled with too many actors of varying skill trying to play against one another. But this new film would have been a perfectly serviceable popcorn film, fun for a night out, fun to share with friends and then go and have a dinner where you laugh and discuss the antics of the characters and the story.<br /><br />But because it was retrofitted for 3-D, and in a time frame that was apparently rushed, the film looks awful. I read one reviewer who commented that you will feel like you want to take your glasses off throughout the film. This was the problem with the old 3-D process. It wasn't very good and it bothered people with glasses or imperfect eyesight. The new process is a vast improvement, making almost everything look realistic and believable, like we are actually watching real life unfold before us. So why on Earth would we want to take a step backwards? Especially after we have had the opportunity to witness what gifted filmmakers can do in the medium. Films like \\"Avatar\\" and PIXAR's \\"Up\\" both demonstrate what this medium has the potential to achieve.<br /><br />\\"Clash of the Titans\\" is likely to make a lot of people think twice before plunking down the extra money for 3-D again. Throughout the film, it looks like they took two copies of the same characters and placed a slightly enlarged version in back of the actual image. Liam Neeson plays Zeus and he sports a wild mane of black hair cascading over his head and down his back. Frequently, when he turns slightly, it looks like his back is enlarging and he resembles Hagrid, played by Robbie Coltrane in the \\"Harry Potter\\" films. The 3-D process does nothing but make the film look more fake and unbelievable, drawing attention to the fact much of the film is created with computer animation. Because of this, we start paying a lot of scrutiny to everything and very little holds up. Everything begins to appear unrealistic and that is completely the opposite of what 3-D should do.<br /><br />In a later scene, Worthington's Perseus is riding Pegasus to a battle with the Kraken. Clearly, the actor is not riding an actual flying horse, but you have to go into these films willing to suspend a certain amount of belief. So, Worthington is riding a CGI creation and the 3-D process draws our eyes to the wayhis head is moving in direct opposition to his torso and his legs. He looks like an action figure who is being posed for stop motion animation. Only instead of capturing a change every frame, to make it appear more fluid, it looks like they make a change every five, ten or fifteen frames, making it appear jerky.<br /><br />Acting is never the strong point in films like this; the subject matter seems too inherently silly. We aren't there to see great acting, we are there to see what we hope might be a fairly believable adventure story, an adventure story enhanced by the 3-D and computer generated graphics. As discussed, the 3-D and the computer-generated graphics are out, so our eyes and our attention turn to other areas and begin to scrutinize. That other area is the acting. Liam Neeson headlines as Zeus, the God who is disappointed with the human race and enters into a deal with Hades, played by Ralph Fiennes. Hades and Zeus are brothers but Hades has a chip on his shoulder and a grudge to bear because Zeus tricked him. Each is acceptable, but when you also remember both actors were in \\"Schindler's List\\", you have to wonder why they would be interested in this film. Clearly, they had some bills to pay. They look suitably solemn and grave, and otherworldly throughout. In fact, after Hades gives the people an ultimatum, he hovers on a black cloud, moving back towards the door. Why does Hades need to use a door? Honestly, all I could think of was Ursula, the octopus sea witch from the animated classic \\"The Little Mermaid\\".<br /><br />Sam Worthington has been cast in a number of films based on his anointment by James Cameron. He made \\"Terminator Salvation\\" and \\"Clash\\" after \\"Avatar\\". Honestly, he has been kind of dull and forgettable in all of the films.<br /><br />The rest of the gods aren't even identified and only one has a line or two. This \\"Clash\\" is all about Perseus, Zeus and Hades. But Perseus flies into battle because he is protecting Andromeda (Alexa Davalos, \\"The Mist\\", TV's \\"Reunion\\", \\"The Chronicles of Riddick\\"). Davalos never changes her expression throughout the film and looks like she is in pain. Why does he even care about her? She's pretty but he seems to meet her when we do and they never have a conversation let alone an intimate moment, they never seem to bond.<br /><br />Mads Mikkleson (\\"Casino Royale\\"), Pete Postlethwhaite, Elizabeth McGovern, Polly Walker (HBO's \\"Rome\\", TV's \\"Caprica\\") and many others pop up for a few moments and then disappear.<br /><br />A completely forgettable mess made all the more forgettable by bad 3-D.

B0036EBARO|4.0|I've never heard a Goldfrapp album that I didn't like, and \\"Head First\\" is no exception. This album goes back to the group's electro-roots and is much different from their last CD, the much mellower \\"Seventh Tree.\\" \\"Head First\\" contains pulsating, flowy, fantastic songs that almost have an 80's feel to them, for some reason. Every song is great, and my personal favorites are \\"Believer\\" and \\"Voicething,\\" a breathy song without words that is truly, truly, truly outrageous. (Yes, I stole that from Jem. So what?) I guess my only complaints about the CD are that it's so short (only nine songs?!), and although I really like all of the tracks, none of them really stand out the way \\"Train,\\" \\"Ooh La La,\\" and \\"A&E\\" did on their respective albums. Still, \\"Head First\\" really is a work of art.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I'll admit it: I hate exercising. It's boring and there always seems to be something better I could be doing with my time. However, as I get older, I find myself becoming more motivated to get healthy. The fact that I've gained a few extra pounds (well, more than a few) is another motivation. I have never watched \\"The Biggest Loser,\\" but I heard great things about this Jillian Michaels DVD from several of my friends, so I decided to give it a try. I'm very glad I did.<br /><br />First of all, \\"30 Day Shred\\" is perfect for someone like me who just wants to get her workout over with as quickly as possible. Jillian's routines combine strength, cardio, and abs for a fast-paced workout that you can do in less than half an hour. (The main workout itself is only about 20 minutes long, and then there are a few minutes of warm up and cool down exercises.) The idea is to work multiple parts of your body at once and to go through the routines fast without stopping to catch your breath.<br /><br />The DVD contains three different levels of workouts. Level 1 wasn't super challenging, so I moved onto Level 2 after just a couple of days. I must tell you, Level 2 is kicking my you-know-what, so it will probably take a couple of weeks before I am brave enough to try Level 3. The workout is short, but I work up a sweat each time. And it's only about 20 minutes of exercising. You really can't beat that.<br /><br />Along with using this DVD, I also modified my eating habits. I'm not a believer in diets, but I did decide that eating everything that didn't move probably wasn't the best way to get myself in better shape. I cut out soda and removed all the alcohol and sweets from my house (sob!), but I haven't cut myself off from the foods I love entirely. My husband and I go out to dinner once a week and I order whatever I want to eat or drink, but I find that I'm not as hungry as I used to be and rarely finish everything on my plate. I'll still have a (small) piece of cake at a birthday party at work, but just one. It was hard at first (and it still is sometimes, especially since I work in the same building as a Hershey's store...yum!), but I'm getting there.<br /><br />Bottom line: this program is working. Between Jillian's workouts and my new eating habits, I lost almost five pounds in the first week! I'm anxious to see how I look and feel at the end of the 30 days. I'm also eager to try some of Jillian's other DVDs. If you're trying to get back into a regular workout routine, this is a great way to do it.one.

I'm also eager to try some of Jillian's other DVDs. If you're trying to get back into a regular workout routine, this is a great way to do it.
0375429204|3.0|Actually, I bought the book because of its highest rating at Amazon. It seems that there is no good book on TOEFL strategy at all. This one mostly describes the test, it gives some hints, but the proposed strategy doesn't appeal to me. Even having learned it, you still have to guess answers if you do not know a correct one. What they call a strategy can not be compared on real strategy proposed in textbooks for the IELTS. In \\"Cracking\\" they have exercises, what is good, but for speaking they propose as an exercise to WRITE your answers, which is stupid because when you speak and write you use different skills (and different areas of the brain, I guess). Very few exercises on speaking. They have one practice test. However, the CD is just an audio CD with audio tracks. So you have to take a paper-based test for training. And you have to manage your time and to record your speaking answers (and you have to do it while speaking). This ain't fittin.  Besides, there are mistakes, typos and wrongly formulated questions in the book. Here is a piece of their \\"Victorian\\" English: \\"By mastering the skill of active reading, you'll be able to not only find the most important information in a passage but also effectively answer the questions that follow\\". Show the phrase to a good English teacher and you'll understand that if you need a score more then 90, you should avoid the book.    The book volume could be two times smaller since there are a lot of blank pages and blank space on pages.
0810979772|5.0|We finally found the perfect series for our 10 year old son. This book is so disarming that he is doing creative writing and doesn't even know it!  This is what learning should be for a 10 year old!  This book follows the \\"Diary\\" series and allows kids to finish cartoons, write future predictions, and answer questions that every 10 year old boy wants to answer.  Highly recommend.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|When I was up late one night and buying psp games I accidentally bought this. I did not return it since I love Final Fantasy games. I never seen any of the movies until this one arrived and can honestly say I was not disappointed. I love the effects and the story line is great. This movie is definately a keeper and I still watch it every so often.

B001AIRUP4|5.0|I got this for my wife whose favorite director is Tim Burton. I had to wait to get these on Blu Ray though and she waited patiently. She loves the movie and with it being on Blu Ray finally made it even better. She watches it on our PS3 system every so often and won't move till it is over. I highly recommend this and love the movie myself.
B00006G8K0|5.0|In the late 1800's in a young man named Jonathan (John Van Eyssen) gets employment from Count Dracula (Christopher Lee) as he finds out later that the Count is a vampire as later he escapes. However the count has an interest in his fiancee Lucy (Cara Marsh) in London to turn her into one of the undead and possibly her brother's wife Mina (Melissa Stribling) as her life is in danger, only Doctor Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) can be the only one to stop this foul being.<br /><br />One of the best Dracula adaptations this side of Dracula (1931), Nosferatu (1922) and Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992). This is the second best besides 1931's movie, here Lee nails the role just like Bela Lugosi as it portrays Dracula as more real than just a guy with slicked down hair or a east Euro accent but more British. This exciting film established British horror studio Hammer besides \\"Curse of Frankenstein\\" to be one of the top notch horror movie studios in the world and Cushing was born to be Van Helsing. The acting is quite good and the score is just tremondous, this movie does Stoker proud as it shows Dracula being more vicious than Bela's role.<br /><br />This DVD has a good transfer on picture and sound with few extras like Cast and crew index, trailer and summary on the production.

B00005JPUN|4.0|Some years ago, I read a review of this film by Stephen Hunter, the Pulitzer Prize winning film critic of the Washington Post. Hunter, before he retired, was easily the finest film critic in the nation, and he gave the movie a thumbs up. Had a few qualms, if I remember,but generally enjoyed the film. So did I. A very exciting, memorable and suspenseful science fiction film with a great performance by Nicole Kidman with a strong supporting cast. Kidman does not generally get raves for her acting but she makes her role as a psychiatrist believable and role as a mother protecting her child unforgettable. A few flaws but, all in all, a very intelligent film, and that can rarely be said about Hollywood nowadays.
B002ZG983M|2.0|So in what world is it *not* a monstrous notion for a father to train his 11-year-old daughter to be a mass murderer? In the world of \\"Kick-Ass,\\" of course.     I don't shy away from violent movies at all, at least as long as the violence carries some sense of satire, irony, justice or is just flat-out entertaining.     But even in the glossiest, most colorful fiction, I just can't get behind the idea of a child, led by a parent, to kill dozens of others in the blood-thirstiest ways available. Especially when those actions are presented as heroic, noble and occasionally bunny-cute. To add insult to countless injuries, the filmmakers' calculated desire to seem audacious and spark controversy is completely transparent.    That isn't the least of the film's problems, but it's a large one among many. The film also has a dull lead character, seriously sloppy cinematography and too many confused ideas about what it's trying to say. Half the time it wants to subvert the superhero mythology, the rest of the time it exemplifies the genre at its worst.     There's also an eager, trying-way-too-hard masochism to the brutality that reminded me of another recent bad movie, \\"Wanted.\\" Which, coincidentally, was also by comic book writer and artist Mark Millar, and which also casually tossed around the notion that if a geek wants to leave behind the life of a loser, he only has to get a gun and start shooting. Bad idea jeans.    p.s. I'm willing to bet people who drop negative votes on this review either didn't read the whole thing, didn't understand it, haven't seen enough movies, are 12 years old or all of the above.

B002YP4EPG|3.0|What can I add- regarding such a legendary guitarist like Steve Hackett? During his participation at Summer Festival in Lugano in July 2009 -He played with a strong impact and a great feeling along with the Swiss crowd too- and that particular gig let me think of the renewed sessions inside his own Recording Studio!! Instead as usual here you find a traditional style, in the vein of some classic successful rock albums such as \\"Watch the storms\\" or \\"Defector\\" (listen to the opener \\"Fire On The Moon\\"), but without forgetting his new exploration into new music territories (a sort of Spanish and ethnic folk, by thinking of the last track)...Anyway, talking about the first songs and in particular \\"Nomads\\", you can already understand and have a small \\"sampling\\" of his new music direction, which is well supported by Anthony Phillips with a 12-string guitar (obviously in the most \\"sensible\\" and acoustic parts); but his typical style is the main part of the whole work. Instead Chris Squire, regarding the bass guitar and Ferenc Kovacs at the violin represent a remarkable choice (the first one as an important member of Yes and the second one as for his strong presence inside an ensemble of World Music, called Djabe!!)...Moreover his vocalism is usually his unique defect within a few solo albums- while here it's offset by the female vocals by Amanda Lehman, as well as the backing vocals by Jo Lehman, being good...then regard John Hackett at the flute, which is able to keep on maintaining the perfect balance between the acoustic parts and those electric ones, when the electric guitar is not present and- at the end-such an important feature makes the present album well worth checking out at least (even though I don' t like his rock-blues style very much- like inside his previous album, but it's a minor defect)...ok, it's not as much important as for instance \\"Spectral Mornings\\", but a good product to buy after all!!...  Final score: between three and four stars- cause the presentwork is often enriched by means of previous unreleased and already listened to- stuff (already played I mean, during his recent concerts all over Europe).
B000EGF0NW|4.0|Very deep, introspective memoir by the author of \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" detailing the effects and aftermath of her rape when she was just 18 years old. I was highly engaged by this book and think it's amazing that the author was able to detail such an awful event with so much soul.
B000NPXL1C|5.0|I read this book when it came out in the 1970's and it had a profound inpact on my life. My experiences in my search for God had been mostly boring and unbelievable but reading the Bible after reading the book changed the way I understood Him. I knew there had to be more and von Daniken showed me that there was. Since that time, my walk with the Lord has been anytyhing but boring and I feel I know him so well and have reason to be able to give him the respect and love He deserves. Now, 40 years later, I give Erich von Daniken credit for my spiritual walk that has been a rock and a joy. My heartfelt thanks go out to him.
B002XTXG1G|4.0|\\"Bronson\\" opens with a brief narration from Charles Bronson, as played by Tom Hardy, stating how he always wanted to be famous.  Cut to a red lit scene where prison guards approach Bronson's cell, while Bronson is gearing up to fight the guards.  This all done to the tune of Scott Walker's \\"The Electrician.\\"  This sets up the stylistic approach to \\"Bronson,\\" which is funny, alarming, disturbing, and at some points sad.    The film is a biography of \\"Britain's most notorious criminal.\\"  While Bronson is known for his wild antics, the director takes a very stylized approach in telling the story, including often ironic pairings of music and violence, ala A Clockwork Orange, Bronson speaking before an audience in clown makeup as he tells his story, and much a dose of very dark humor.  The approach makes this a fun film to watch.  As to how the viewer perceives Bronson, that's another story.    In the film, Bronson is presented as a curious figure.  He's possibly insane and possibly sociopathic.  The script makes Bronson appear unapologetic, noting that his upbringing was decent enough, and stating how he loved prison.  The only time we get a chance to sympathize is possibly the original sentence, where Bronson stole about 40 dollars and went to jail initially for seven years.  He then states that the prison cell was like a hotel room for him.  He gets in numerous fights, is shuffled from prison to prison and hospital to hospital, where he remains today.  The film primarily focuses on the incidents that kept getting him in trouble.    The film is anchored by the stylized approach and Tom Hardy's performance, which shifts between a subtle insane calmness, to a manic intensity.  Whether it's a straight performance of Bronson or not doesn't matter.  It fits the tone of the film and is funny and scary at the same time.  The film features a very carefully orchestrated soundtrack and unique cuts that keep the story interesting, which is a feat considering how much of Bronson'slife was spent behind bars in solitary confinement.    The film drags a bit toward the end, but it's altogether a fine film.  My one gripe is the intent of this film seems curious.  As a character, Bronson is fascinating to study.  However, it's easy to see how a viewer might feel the director is praising his exploits, or at the very least, take an obscene interest in this man as a celebrity.  He says he always wanted to be famous.  Well, if we're watching the film, then I guess he succeeded.
B000063Y8F|5.0|I have owned this garlic press for almost 7 years (bought right here on Amazon). It has seen continued, regular use over that entire time, and has been washed both by hand and in the dishwasher with the same results! It is perfect and still looks brand new. I love this press! What an investment. The best part is that the price is just about the same today as it was 7 years ago. Buy this press. You will be happy, and the years of use you will get out of it will more than make up for the few extra dollars it costs. Bon Apetite!

I bought this movie based on other reviews which made it appear to be a great movie about the attack on Pearl Harbor.  It's not!  It really is a love story.  The Japanese just happen to attack during this love story.  This movie is crap!  It's not even a good chick flick.    I'm angry that I was duped into spending my time and money on this tripe!  I think I'll use it for target practice!
B00354Y9ZU|2.0|This is one great idea wrapped up in a big pile of fluff and filling.    If you're the kind of person who can't understand a concept unless its explained to you by example 30 or 40 times with the wording slightly changed and different examples provided each time, then you might need to invest a few bucks and few hours of your life in this book.    Otherwise, the great idea of the book is that you should be a linchpin, not a cog.      There, I just saved you a few hours of your life.

0061134007|3.0|The author has gotten some excellent reviews in the U.S. press which I do not understand. The book has a clever, convoluted plot with an historical background of the Norwegians who fought in WW2 in the Nazi Army against Communism. However, none of the characters have any depth to them nor is there any real sense of place. It would make a better television movie as the cinematography could provide the latter. I have no interest in reading more of this author's work.

0543897869|5.0|Il etait une fois... once upon a time, the two essential avenues for advancement for a poor youth in France were the military and the Catholic Church, symbolized by the red of the army uniforms (yes, before the machine guns of World War I made them change their pants) and the black of the clerical gowns. Stendhal, the nom de plume for Henri Beyle, had his classic work published in 1830, just as Louis-Philippe d' Orleans was restored to the throne. The protagonist is Julian Sorel, of - dare I use the word - \\"humble\\" origin, the son of a carpenter, born in Franche-Comt&eacute;, a rugged area of France that borders Switzerland. He was determined to \\"make his way in society,\\" and Stendhal says that Hercules was an inspiration; it was not a question of a choice between vice and virtue, rather it was one between the mediocrity of an assured well-being and all the heroic dreams of youth.<br /><br />Post-Napoleon, Sorel felt that his greatest chances of advancement to a high level of society were in the Catholic Church. Remember, it was a very different time, far away from the empty cathedrals that only tourists visit in France today. And as the novel adequately describes, the sexual hypocrisy of the male clergy was focused on women, and not the alter boys of today. Yet the \\"eternal truths\\" of the novel require only the modest substitution of Wall Street for the Catholic Church, and the rest, the careerism and political opportunism, the cynicism and the hypocrisy remain remarkably the same. Sorel decides to \\"utilize\\" well-placed women in his rise in society, starting with the wife of the mayor, Mme. De Renal, and later, one of his pupils, Mathilde, who will bear his child. Though Stendhal does not use the particular phrase, \\"hell hath no wrath like a woman scorned...\\" he does use the expression, \\"these terrible instruments of the feminine artillery...\\" which in the end exact the ultimate in revenge.<br /><br />As other reviewers of the English language translation have pointed out, this is one of the very first \\"modern\\" French novels. There is the in-depth psychological drama of Sorel's moves as he struggles up the \\"ladder\\" of society, and there is also Stendhal's acerbic comments on the society itself. Anticipating Sinclair Lewis' \\"Main Street\\" by over a hundred years, Stendhal says: \\"The tyranny of opinion, and what opinion! It is as foolish in the little villages of France as in the USA.\\"  Or again, \\"In their eyes, he was convicted of this enormous vice - he thought, he made judgments by himself, in place of blindly following authority and example.\\" Stendhal anticipates the anti-clerical sentiments of the Third Republic with: \\"In the ordinary positions of the life she hardly believed in religion, thought Julien, she loved it as very useful to the interests of her caste.\\" Likewise, \\"My faith, if I find the God of the Christians, I am lost, it is a despot, and as such he is filled with the ideas of vengeance.\\"<br /><br />Wise and insightful of the human condition, consider a few other Stendhal observations: \\"The Russians copy French morals, but always 50 years later. They are now in the century of Lousi XV.\\" Or, \\"My faith, not so foolish; each for himself in this desert of egotism that one calls the life.\\" And foreshadowing his own doom, and rendering a stronger metaphor for that aforementioned feminine artillery: \\"An English traveler retold the tale where he lived with a tiger; he raised it, and caressed it, but always on the table was the loaded pistol.\\"<br /><br />I love well-chosen epigraphs, and Stendhal has them \\"in spades,\\" in three different languages. \\"The Red and the Black\\" was written over 180 years ago, but remains marvelously insightful of the human condition, including all its hubris and petty revenges.

B002ZG98J6|5.0|First off let me just say that I have read all 5 books at least twice through. I am an avid fan of this series. I was looking forward to this movie for quite a while. Of course this takes the course that many book adaptions take. That is, it differs from the book in many ways. Personally, I went to the midnight showing of this film expecting the differences, and went with an open mind to the idea of differences. And you know what? I immensely enjoyed this film! First, let me run down some differences between the book and film.     Unless you've read the book and don't mind finding out what was cut and changed, consider this your SPOILER ALERT!      First and most obviously, the ages of the actors. They are all in their late teens, whereas the kids in the book are 12.     Second, no Ares, Clarisse, or Dionysus. The fight for the Lightning Bolt is with Luke instead of Ares. And Annabeth takes on the role of the warrior girl in the movie.     Third, instead of a quest, Percy Grover and Annabeth just ditch camp to get the lightning bolt and save Percy's mother.     Fourth, NO PROPHECY. No mention of Thalia or the Big Three pact. I hope they mention it in The Sea of Monsters if they make it.     Those are the 4 biggest changes I remember from the movie and biggest complaints from avid fans. Logan Lerman (Percy), Alexandra Daddario (Annabeth), Brandon T Jackson (Grover), and Jake Abel (Luke) are all great actors. I hadn't really heard of them until The Lightning Thief. But they are terrific actors! Brandon is hilarious as Grover, and makes tons of jokes as the comic relief. Some may find his constant cracking of joke irritating, but in the right mood he's hilarious.     Sean Bean, and Kevin Mckidd are great as Zeus and Poseidon respectively. They're not in it very much, but Mr. Mckidd's entrance in the beginning of the film is awesome. I won't reveal more, but he's the first we see in the film.     And lets not forget Uma Thurman as Medusa! She was brilliantly done, and was very spooky and awesome. If you've read the book you know she dies, but I wish they would find a way to bring back Medusa because Uma Thurman was brilliant!    All in all, this was an amazing film, and I look forward to the deleted scenes included with the Blu-Ray release, because only 5 out of 10 scenes are on the DVD release. Plus, the Blu-Ray comes with a DVD and a code for a free copy on iTunes, which is brilliant. So this is a great film for the whole family, and I know I will be headed to the store to get it after it's release. (or, I think I'll just buy from amazon, because they do have really good prices on Blu-Rays)
0380730367|4.0|If you like this book, you may also enjoy the book [[ASIN:0553592149 False Memory]] by Dean Koontz. Both are very well written and I enjoyed the many plot twists and the suspense.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Finally, the greatest science fiction film ever made, the way it was meant to be seen.  Ridley Scott & Co. have gone to great lengths to craft an all-new cut of the film, consistent with Scott's true vision for Blade Runner.  This new \\"Final Cut\\" truly is the definitive version of Blade Runner, and after years of half-hearted acceptance of a so-called \\"Director's Cut\\" made in the director's absence, fans can sit back and enjoy the film that we SHOULD have gotten a quarter century sooner.  Of course, with so much time now past, Scott and his team make use of the new technologies at hand, but never undercut the original FX.  Indeed, the original Visual Effects supervisors were brought in to shepherd and approve the new digital FX, with complete respect for their original work in 1982.  Also of note is the improved color timing of the Final Cut, which serves to enhance the neo-noir style and atmosphere of the film.    Of course, for those who may not share my feelings of complete satisfaction regarding the Final Cut, this set also includes the U.S. and International Theatrical Cuts, the 1992 Director's Cut, and the fabled Workprint from the Denver and Dallas screenings.  While the Director's Cut was one of the very first DVDs on the open market back in 1997, this is the first time the theatrical cuts have been made available since the Criterion laserdisc of the International Cut, and the first chance for fans to own the Workprint.  And though the Workprint is as rough as may be expected, all cuts of the film benefit greatly from the 1080p presentation of Blu-Ray.  The look of Blade Runner on BD is highly cinematic and certainly reference quality.  A fine layer of film grain is present throughout, colors are rich and vibrant, and the detail is astonishing.    If you're not sold yet, there's also a three and a half hour documentary on the making of the film.  And even with its incredible runtime, not a single moment of Dangerous Days is filler.  It's easily the most comprehensive documentary I've ever seen on any film, covering every conceivable topic, from conception to legacy, from every conceivable angle, with a host of interviews.  And if that's not enough, there's a fifth disc with even MORE extras, including a feature on the history of the alternate cuts and the restoration and creation of the Final Cut.  In short, the extras are every bit as definitive as the rest of the package.  You get every cut of the film in HD, and hours upon hours of extras (in standard definition), all for an extremely reasonable price.    If you're even remotely a fan of Blade Runner, you owe it to yourself to own this set, and to see the film in such amazing detail.  I owned the DVD set prior to this, and the quality there was as strong as standard definition would allow.  The Blu-Ray set absolutely trounces it in every way.  The PQ and AQ are a revelation, and any fan should be overjoyed with this brilliant set.
0545123267|5.0|Initially, as I know many were, I found myself attracted to Shiver's beautiful cover.  The screen doesn't do it justice. Holding this book is like receiving a birthday present: it's a real treat.     But Shiver is much more than a pretty picture.    [Slight SPOILERS, Beware]  Werewolf stories are nothing new, but Shiver is. Told in the dual narratives of our two protagonists, Grace and Sam, Shiver is the story of the star-crossed (though perhaps winter-crossed, is more appropriate) lovers, and their fight to stay together against forces far beyond their control. This, to me, was one of the most interesting aspects of the story. There is really no antagonist to this story--perhaps the lycanthropic condition, combined with seasonal change, is the villain, rather than an individual being.  [End of any potential spoilers :)]    Shiver's wolves are a refreshing and unique take on a much loved, but much done, genre. I hate to ruin the surprise myself, because it's such a clever and absorbing moment in the story.  The book is told in easily digestible sections, perfect for short sittings (if you can put it down), but the story flows beautifully, and I personally adored Stiefvater's prose (so smooth, 'flowy' and lyrical).    While one could say Shiver shares a lot in common with a great number of other YA PNR around (werewolves, lonely protagonist, absent parents and love story), it had its own special, unique spark that, months after reading it, keeps it fresh in my mind. It should go down a treat with those who like YA paranormal, but the story is told so tenderly and with such beautiful restraint, I believe it could appeal to non-genre readers.    Gripping, hopeful and heartbreaking, I found the story kept me wondering till the  very last page.  I flat-out adored Shiver.

Saving herself and Peeta set off a spark that is spreading quickly through the other districts. A spark that the girl on fire is not sure she wants to put out.<br /><br />Everything is spinning out of control.<br /><br />Katniss' only hope to protect her loved ones is to convince all of Panem that she was mad with love, not rebellion.

Months after the Games, Katniss still can't unravel her true feelings for Peeta anymore than she can admit that their relationship is an elaborate act for the cameras.<br /><br />It's hard enough traveling from district to district pretending to be madly in love without knowing if any of it is real. But the reaping is approaching and with it the time for Katniss and Peeta to return to the Capitol as mentors for the 75th Hunger Games--a special year for the Games which never means anything good for the districts.<br /><br />Good or bad, the spark has been lit and there's no turning back in Catching Fire (2009) by Suzanne Collins.<br /><br />Being the second book in a trilogy, this one has an understandably slower start than The Hunger Games. Collins spends a fair bit of time recapping plot points and reintroducing characters. Even with those details, readers will be hard pressed to follow Catching Fire without its predecessor (hint: read this trilogy in order).<br /><br />That said, I might actually prefer this one to the first.<br /><br />Readers have already been inside the Hunger Games seeing life in the arena and understanding the spectacle in all of its authoritarian gore. Catching Fire, by contrast, takes readers behind the scenes. Collins spends a lot more time building up the politics of Panem and introducing readers to the other districts. Add to that the fledgling seeds of revolution and you have some of my favorite literary tropes.<br /><br />Catching Fire also adds past victors into the mix along with more of Panem's past. Then there's the whole massive-twist-that-changes-everything in the middle of the story (that some people very irresponsibly add to their booktalks or reviews even though it's totally a spoiler).<br /><br />On top of that, this book spends a lot more time looking at the relationship between Katniss and Peeta. Is it love? Peeta knows what he thinks while Katniss is less certain. She knows  she doesn't want to get married or have children and she isn't sure if that means she also doesn't want to love anyone even though she wants to do everything in her power to keep Peeta safe (my own thoughts: it's love--and I will be so pissed if Collins disagrees with that).<br /><br />If The Hunger Games was a loud, free-spirited book, Catching Fire is its more introverted, creative counterpart. Everything readers love from the first book is here, but at the same time more space is given to character development and world building (two things I always want to see in my dystopian adventure novels).<br /><br />Possible Pairings: In the Time of the Butterflies by Julia Alvarez,  Graceling by Kristin Cashore, City of Ashes by Cassandra Clare, Never Smile at a Monkey: And 17 Other Important Things to Remember by Steve Jenkins, The Bride's Farewell by Meg Rosoff, Pretties by Scott Westerfeldg readers to the other districts.

0439023483|5.0|In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. Ruthless and calculating, the Capitol rules the districts with an iron hand. Especially after what happened to District 13. But people don't talk about that.<br /><br />Inside the Capitol life is a constant celebration filled with beauty and abundance, especially during the Games. Outside the Capitol, in the other districts, people live in poverty struggling to find enough to eat. To remind them, year after year, that they once rebelled and are now conquered, the Capitol has made the Hunger Games an annual spectacle of brutality masked as entertainment.<br /><br />Two tributes are required from each district. One boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen. Whisked from their homes, forced into an arena, the tributes are trained, armed, and ordered to fight to the death. There is one Victor in every Game. But no one ever truly beats the Hunger Games because no one can ever truly beat the Capitol.<br /><br />Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen doesn't care about the Games. She cares her mother and protecting her younger sister Prim. She cares about surviving and finding enough food for her family. For Katniss, underfed and ill-prepared, stepping into the arena promises a quick and gruesome death.<br /><br />Her male counterpart, Peeta Mellark, is unlikely to fare much better.<br /><br />There can only be one Victor. But working together, Katniss and Peeta might just find a way to beat the Games in The Hunger Games (2008) by Suzanne Collins.<br /><br />By now, this book hardly needs a review. Wildly popular, The Hunger Games already flies off the shelves. After reading the book, it's easy to see why.<br /><br />Collins presents a bleak, futuristic world filled with action and the promise of excitement and intrigue. The Hunger Games is not written as a story being told to a reader. Instead Katniss seems to be talking directly to the reader. The immediacy and pathos this adds to the story cannot be overstated. Readers are right there with Katniss as she meets the other tributes--and calculates how best to kill them and the likelihood that they will beat her to it. Katniss could be cold and calculating, indeed she often is, but the dynamic between Katniss and the other characters makes her more than that. It makes her human.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is essentially filled with battles, twists, and suspense. But it is also the story of life in a police state. Even more, it is the story of a girl learning who she is in the most unlikely of settings and understanding that sometimes victory can be about a whole lot more than winning.<br /><br />Possible Pairings: Black Potatoes by Susan Campbell Bartoletti, Graceling by Kristin Cashore, City of Bones by Cassandra Clare, Gregor the Overlander by Suzanne Collins, Incarceron by Catherine Fisher, The Miles Between by Mary E.

B0036EBARO|4.0|I love the fact that with each new Goldfrapp CD, fans get a whole new Goldfrapp! I really like each and every one of their CDs. Seventh Tree is my favorite, and every time I listen to it, I hear something new. Head First is not at all like Seventh Tree, and to me, that's great! Each song has an identifiable beat or riff that can be traced back to a 70s or 80s song and that is one of the most fun things about it. I can listen to Seventh Tree for introspective, moody music, and I can listen to Head First to dance my butt off, have fun, drive fast down the highway...whatever! Long live Goldfrapp!
B003A6C67G|5.0|The sound on this remaster is the best i have ever heard,and i thought the remastered slide and slip were good,the extras are quite sensational too,with bonus tracks,b-sides and a dvd!  The dvd takes you back to those large hair days of the 80s,but lets not remember this album for that,because the songs stand up so well,as the dvd shows the current line up preforming them.  I love the current line up,but it sure would be interesting to see,as time is a great healer,what Mr Coverdale and Mr Sykes could come up with today.  Once again,the price looks steep,but you would pay 12 dollars at least for the dvd alone,and the packaging overall is quite,quite beautiful,and you have an amazing album as well.  what are you waiting for? Go an get it!
B0036SQZ2K|5.0|I am a huge fan of dark comedy. Not everyone understands it. It's sort of like some people might consider Sweeney Todd a gore-fest travesty, but it's not. So while this movie is not a blockbuster success, it is still the sort of film I love. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense and it's not suppose to, though I know our government has funded silly enough projects.  So here's to The Men Who Stare at Goats, the pre-cursors to the Jedi Knights.
B002WY65VU|4.0|Zombie Land is once in a life time contemporary funny zombie movie that any young adult and old timer, who loves spoof movies, will enjoy. Woody Harrison and Bill Murray are excellent perks to this movie.  Grab a beer and take notes, which you'll hopefully never need to use, because this movie is the American version of \\"Shawn of the Dead\\" and is a DVD you'll want to add to your silly zombie collection.
B0015DROBO|4.0|A comment for correction in the electronic format:<br /><br />The word JUDGMENT is misspelled 5 or 6 times in the first 5% of the Kindle version.
0307271862|2.0|Short and sweet.  I have read all the mysteries and think that the translation is superb.  This book was a huge disappointment.  After a quick and interesting start, it bogged down into a long, detailed, and unplausible African venture.  We know that Mankell lives in Africa most of the time.  In my view, this is a book that he uses to write a long essay on Chinese influence in Africa.  Don't buy.  MM
B0015DYIH2|5.0|i love this book espically the whole series. i read all the books so many times and cant wait for the new book to come out
B0030Y11XS|5.0|This movie has to be the most realest thing that I have ever seen! Not the sugar-coated news from CNN, Fox, MSNBC, but this dvd shows how Wall Street and Republicans have damned this great nation to hell!    It shows how Capitalism is tricked into the minds of people, of how it makes people continue to support Capitalism, because of them one day thinking that they will have a chance at the American Dream.    This movie has a couple of 1 star ratings from the \\"right wing\\" conservatives, that have been tricked, manipulated by there party, that one day I will be rich too. Don't pay them any mind.
0152438181|5.0|A classic edition of the wonderful book. A must for any lover of French and childrens' fantasies!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Let me see if I have this correct. Avatar is 19.99 since I have prime I get free shipping. I get a 10.00 off if I buy the upgraded one in the future, making this one 9.99. I can then take this one to the Movie Trading Company and get 3.00 to 5.00 for it if I am lucky but 3.00 is the most likely price. So I am out 6.99 to rent this for 7 months. That is a dollar a month, that is less that a Blockbuster rental, a Redbox rental or my Netflix subscrition. Tell me again why I should not buy this version? I get to watch this  as many times as I want for a dollar or 2 a month. Yes I am getting this and I am going to enjoy it. The ones that want to whine about things missing and waiting for the special edition can wait. I am going to enjoy the movie.
B0009ML238|5.0|First thing is first, these guys are pure progressive metal, but they are NOT Dream Theater clones.  They have their own thing going 100% and quite personally I prefer these guys more.  Dream Theater is more of a \\"musicians band\\" (some non-musicians have a hard time listening to them) while these guys they find are easier to listen to.  This is their first album and it is a real gem.  Everything from the guitar riffs to the vocals are fantastic!  You definitely do not want to miss these guys if you are into progressive metal!
B002RAREAK|1.0|I picked this album up a couple of days ago, and I've listened to it twice already to see if I missed something the first time.  I didn't.  This is probably Usher's weakest effort so far.  There is no flow to the album, and it is loaded with dance tunes that won't get any air play or club play.  He needs to do some real soul searching to find out what kind of artist he really wants to be.  I think his personal life has been a distraction from his craft.  The talent is still there, but he needs to find some producers who can help him \\"stretch out.\\"  I am very disappointed and will be very careful when buying anything else he releases.
B002UNMW7O|4.0|Purchased the movie for my son.  Says it was great.  His favorite movies
B002VECM72|5.0|This movie is a surprise--touching, not 'corny,' idealized in various degrees, yes, but wonderfully effective.  Sandra Bullock's performance is Oscar-worthy--beautifully understated.  The film offers genuine insights into ethnic prejudices, economic and social disparities and University politics in sports programs. Worth repeated viewings.  A good family film for families with kids 10 and older.
1569242739|5.0|I went vegan to try and reduce animal suffering the best way I saw how, not to give up cupcakes. I appreciate the lengthy introduction and the many tips for producing great cupcakes. For someone like me, whose cupcake expertise was limited to how quickly I could pour the contents of a box into a bowl, I think the cooking tips were a perfect addition. I have noticed that the cupcakes taste different than the nonvegan cupcakes I ate before, but to me different doesn't equal bad. I really value this book and I hope more people use it to integrate vegan foods into their life, even if its only for the occasional treat.
B00280LYIC|5.0|One of my kids was reading this whole series and he was really into it.  He's a smart kid and so I decided to check it out.  It's a kids' book, which means it is limited in scope.  You won't find adult relationships in \\"The Lightning Thief\\", and that's a good thing because it's for kids.  The adolescent relationships are well done.  For me as a parent, reading a book like this that has enormous appeal to kids gives insight into how kids think.  Well, my teen was right, and this is a very good book.  The use of mythology, which we all know a little about, works well.  Sure, a story about children of the ancient Greek gods calls for a suspension of disbelief, but the characters ring true.  In fiction, that seems to be what's key.  When characters are true to themselves, even in a strange situation, it works.  This book is good for adults as well as kids.
B001C4AFOY|2.0|This piece of British history is a terrific topic rich with all sorts of potential.  The actors in this new version  are adorable, believable and endearing.  The sets and costumes are accurate and elegant.  I for one am getting a bit tired of the Churchill family making all this money constantly renting Blenheim Palace for every historic epic out there.  I mean good grief I do think many people now recognize that imposing ediface.  If you don't remember it from recent efforts, just think of or view Heath Ledger's \\"The Four Feathers\\" or Kenneth Branagh's production of \\"Hamlet\\" to name two recent films.  There are so many gorgeous palaces in the U.K., and elsewhere in Europe, that I pray film makers will in the future choose a new place to represent the palace/home of some person or family.  But back to the film.  It moves along too fast to give one the feeling one actually knows the story well.  For example, the impact of Victoria's mother and her private secretary was much more severe.  Her relationship with her mother was very complex.  And with her life long companion Lehzen.  As to the assaisination attempt I remember from other films and bios of Victoria that neither she or Albert were hurt.  So I wonder at the license taken herein.  Why?  If you wish to see something more accurate, just as elegantly filmed, with actors just as endearing but with a story line fleshed more and told more truthfully, rent or buy \\"Victoria and Albert\\".  Recently done and frankly much much better story of these two people.  The parting shot at the end of \\"The Young Victoria\\" is odd.  That \\"they\\" ruled the U.K. together.  I think that is something biographers will argue about forever.  I'm with the group that says NO.  She ruled alone with the advice of \\"my Albert\\".
0451169514|5.0|I saw It when I was 5 or 6 years old, when it debuted on tv, and to put it bluntly, it scared the hell out of me. Literally NOTHING ELSE has ever scared me since then, no matter how graphic, suspenseful or gritty a movie or event in my life may have been, nothing compares to seeing that clown do what he did in the movie version. A few months ago, I bought the book after enjoying The Shining, expecting it to be great as well since everyone who read the book and saw the movie for It usually said the book was much better. Sure enough, they were right. This is one of those books that I'll never forget. Every single chapter had me hooked, and even now, a few months after finishing it, I can still remember every character's name, first and last, and give you a brief history over them, and the town of Derry that they lived in. Yeah, I haven't been this into a book since probably Where the Red Fern Grows, and that was all the way back in 1996.    It's hard to really provide a helpful plot summary without giving away any of the plot, of which there's a lot in It. The story is told in 2 and a half sections, with each section mixed up. You have the main characters (The Losers) in the present, as children, and bits and pieces of Derry's history as told by Mike, one of The Losers. 'long story short, a very brutal murder took place in Derry in the present time, and Mike Hanlon goes to contact his friends, who thought they put an end to the menace that caused this murder, and many more, when they were children. It turned out to be a clown, Pennywise, though that's actually just one of many forms it can take. Whatever scared them when they were kids is what they saw, be it a monster from a horror movie, an odd looking statue, a family member, anything. In the past, The Losers were also tormented by the town bullies, led by a very menacing Henry Bowers, who is basically the equivalent of Jack Torrance from The Shining when he snaps, but as a teenager. Maybe even worse. When Mike brings the group back together, they set forth to settle things once and for all, though what It is, is actually more than they could ever imagine.    Again, so much happens in this book that even the plot summary here on Amazon barely covers 1% of it. The history of Derry alone is enough to make up a short novel. I didn't expect a town history segment of a book to be as interesting as it was here, especially since I usually like it when the story progresses and doesn't get put on hold just for the sake of background information. And the characters, these people are so real that after getting even halfway through the book, you'll feel like you knew them in real life. Stephen King fleshes nearly every single one out to the point where I knew some of them better than my own friends when I was that age. How he describes their emotions and the magic of summer as a child really took me back, and as lame as it sounds, I felt like I was there with The Losers. This book is a masterpiece, plain and simple, and it pains me to hold back anything, being vague in my 'you have to read this' mode I'm in right now without really giving you any reasons to do so. If you watched the movie and think you might know a lot of what happens here, you're kind of right. The movie covered the main parts of when The Losers were kids, but it definitely toned things down as far as how bad Henry and his buddies were (I can't stress enough how nuts Henry is in the book), what It really is, Derry's history, and of course the ending to both the past and present portions.    There is one part in the book that doesn't happen until very, very late on (I think the last 50 pages or so), and to be honest, it wasn't anywhere near as graphic or bad as I was expecting based on what others have said. Stephen King handled the situation in a very mature way, didn't describe more than he should've or needed to, and the scene is over quickly. I didn't have any problems with this, and I think only the most uptight people who are quick to call others sick without realizing what he intended will be offended by it. But instead, my only minor complaint is that he didn't use two of the main characters as much as he should have. Poor Stan barely gets any time in either portion, though it's understandable for one of them. But in the other, I often felt like I missed a sentence that said he left or was possibly killed, only to see him show up a few pages later. Young Mike gets the same treatment, but I guess you can't even out the time with a group of kids when, despite them working as a unit, there are really 3 main characters when you get down to it.    Many consider this to be a horror book, but after getting to know the characters and see how much time was spent with them over the creature they were facing, I saw it as more of a coming of age story in some senses. I don't have much more to say about It. This is just one of those books that you have to read for yourself and won't want to put down. There'd be days when I'd rush things at work or at home just so I could get some time in to read another page or two, and I rarely do that. If the length of the book intimidates you like it did me, don't worry- everything goes by very fast, and it never drags on. I wonder if any of King's other books can compare to this now.    Thanks for the trip Mike, Ben, Eddie, Stan, Beverly, Richie and Bill. I'll never forget it.
B001OQCV6A|3.0|I had high expectations for this movie upon heading into the theatre - and was a little let down. But I'm going to address the high points first. I thought that Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr. had some great chemistry together. They really had the relationship between Holmes and Watson that I enjoyed. I had never imagined in my head that Watson and Holmes would be \\"tough guys\\", but they are the Holmes and Watson for the new millennium! Rachel McAdams' character seemed a little pointless. She was there for the pretty factor but really didn't affect much of the plot.<br /><br />Now that we are speaking of the plot - it really left a lot to be desired. There was an aspect of the paranormal that was included, which ended up being explained - but it really didn't fit with my impression of Sherlock Holmes stories. They could have had a perfectly good plotline without the paranormal.<br /><br />I get the feeling that there will definitely be a sequel - based on the way the ending played out.  But if there is, I hope they go back to basics a little more.  I'm not a die hard Holmes fan, but this was more of an action/adventure/paranormal movie and much less mystery.
0805091742|5.0|Seems like an odd thing for a surgeon of international renown to spend his time on: the lowly checklist. But the results speak for themselves. In a controlled trial involving eight hospitals all around the globe (from rural Tanzania, to Amman, Jordan to Seattle, Washington) they observed double-digit reductions in major surgical complications and in deaths. He correctly notes that if there were a pharmaceutical drug or medical device that could produce these results, every newspaper around the world would be blaring the headlines. But, in this case, there's no big payday - only improved outcomes for patients.<br /><br />As it happens, Seattle was one of the first stops in the obligatory book tour that ensues, so I got a chance to meet and speak with him. In his talks, he provides some greater context to the work in the book. For example, the impetus for exploring the approach of using checklists during surgery (his study focuses exclusively on surgery) was engendered by the success of checklists in aviation. It may come as a surprise that there are checklists for pilots even in emergency cases like the plane landing on the Hudson last year.<br /><br />Truth be told, the pioneer of using checklists in medical procedures is Dr. Peter Pronovost of Johns Hopkins. By creating a brief (must take no longer than 90 sec), simple checklist of the most crucial items needed to ensure central line catheters are applied safely, his checklist resulted in Johns Hopkins eliminating (as in reducing to -0-) infections for these procedures. He went on to do a pilot for all the hospitals in Michigan which led to those hospitals becoming the exemplar for patient safety for central line catheterization. But he doesn't write for the New Yorker. Nor did he take on the massive effort of organizing a controlled study in hospitals all over the globe (that's massive) and organize the team to produce the results of those efforts.<br /><br />One additional thing to note about these checklists (in addition to their brevity) is that they need to be very carefully crafted to ensure that only the most critical items that are likely to be missed/overlooked are covered. It's common to think of a checklist as being exhaustive, detailed and cumbersome. Obviously, that wouldn't work in this context. Further, as you can't set foot in the OR unless you know what you're doing, the checklist is not a READ-DO checklist (like a recipe), but a DO-CONFIRM checklist where you're pausing before each critical juncture to confirm that everyone is on the same page and has completed all the crucial activities for the safety of the patient and the increased success of the surgery.<br /><br />One final insight that occurs to me is that this idea could have legs with patients. This is because once this issue becomes common knowledge, it could be one of those things that patients begin demanding of their providers. It's something any patient can easily grok (Do you have a checklist, or don't you?) without having to know anything about the intricacies of care.ity) is that they need to be very carefully crafted to ensure that only the most critical items that are likely to be missed/overlooked are covered.

B002A9IZ9C|3.0|While this flash sounded perfect - just like the Canon 580II but at half the price - it just didn't work out. I actually went through two of these flashes, hoping the first was just a lemon (it arrived DOA). The second one worked for about 2 weeks and then quit firing. Even when it did work, I wasn't very happy with it as it was pretty temperamental, and it never did seem to work properly. Too bad Nissin missed on this one.    ~updated review, 5-29-2011~    Working with the vendor (not Amazon) I ended up trying out one more of these flash units. This one had some upgraded firmware, and that seemed to do the trick. I had purchased this flash primarily for off-camera work, and the new firmware, (as well as updated firmware from Pocket Wizard to help with compatibility) it is now working well. It's not quite as reliable in TTL mode as the Canon 580 EX II, but I am happy with it now. Manual mode works very, very well.     This being said, I am still very hesitant to purchase another Nissin product considering the difficulty and run around I had with this one.
B002VECM6S|1.0|This is a white-friendly, feel good film that will bore you unless you're a football addict.  And even then you may wonder why it came up on the Academy Award radar screen at all.  Except that Bullock is a big money-maker and it serves the industry to praise her.  She hits one note in this film and keeps hitting that note.  Again and again she hits that one single note, and when you've had enough she hits it some more.  Pretty soon she's SO boring.   Ultimately she just wears you down.  Help!  A goose with a good, strong honk could have played that role.  I suppose it's sort of fun to watch rich, privileged white people successfully bulldoze their way to the head of the line while poor non-whites have to wait their turn.  Oh yes, and we're clearly supposed to rejoice that Bullock's character patronizes a big needy black person, and is short tempered with her racist Republican luncheon companions.

1416583408|5.0|This is an elegantly written and engaging account of those beings with whom we share so much. Canine biology is blended effortlessly with a wonder and love of the dogs the author has known. Sometimes the science of `inside of a dog' is stretched to a slightly romantic treatment but I certainly take no offence - a love of the subject has rendered an elegant account of what makes dogs tick. Luath, the canine member of our gang, has been the bemused subject of extensive experimentation while I read the book. His behaviour has not always been `textbook' but I have been guided in exploring and interpreting our relationship. This is a book you will think about for a long time, especially if you have a canine cue in your life.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|It actually took me a while to like this album. It's just such a different sound than anything that's come before it. I don't know if I want to call \\"Oracular Spectacular\\" a revelation or a breakthrough, but it's certainly something close to that. This album has brought psychedelia back, and given it a whole new sound. It took me a couple listens to get into the groove of \\"Oracular Spectacular\\", but when I did, it became one of my favorites. This album is just amazing through and through.
1416583408|3.0|I love dogs so I am always open to reading more about them. I was hoping for some fresh information on that subject but I did not feel that I found it in this book. I guess there are not that many studies done on dogs but it seems like studies that were referenced were rehash of the same old, information. It seems that scientific books on dogs are required to ignore anecdotal evidence that I think could have bolstered the information presented and added interest to the book. I had a hard time getting through it. It was one of those books that I would put down and then had to convince myself that I was looking forward to reading more.
B0037W68F4|5.0|\\"Congratulations\\" takes some of the psychedelic feel from \\"Oracular Spectacular\\" and expands on it.  In doing so, the album strays into somewhat unfamiliar territory, but still produces some amazing songs. To me, they have taken on a bit of a Pink Floyd style, wherein they expound on a common theme throughout the album, i.e. \\"Animals\\"... this sort of technique can be repetitive at times, but the more you listen, the more you understand the flow of the album. So, it's more psychedelic than their first album, but there are still some catchy songs... but nothing like the addictive, chorus-driven ballads on MGMT's first album. The album definitely produces a whole new sound than \\"Oracular Spectacular\\", but they are progressing, which I like to see. I really like what the band has done here, and I feel we will see more great work from them for years to come.
B000002KON|5.0|Wow! Thank you, Ray Davies, for exposing your heart and genius in this new interpretation of your music. Being a fan of many genres of music, I appreciate the Kinks and Ray Davies, but would never be called a Kinks fanatic. However, after seeing Ray in concert on 11/22/09 in Albany, New York and then purchasing The Kinks Choral Collection I am truly a devoted fan.<br />  For me rock music reaches its promise in this album. As with all art the ultimate hope is that the listener be moved in some way. In this new avenue into the music of the Kinks and Ray Davies, the heart and soul of this music is revealed in a way that just wasn't possible in its original form. At the same time the earthiness of the music is preserved by his outstanding band.<br />  Resist the temptation to compare these songs to the originals. You may well miss the point. These songs have evolved. The choir brings a new point of view and a wonderful counterpoint to Ray's distinctive voice and the band. Ray's wit and frustration with the state of the world often hide the human longing, heartbreak, and fervent aspirations for a better world for us all. Cases in point here are: Do You Remember Walter, Village Green, Days, and Waterloo Sunset. Workingman's Cafe from Ray's most recent solo release of the same name beautifully reminds us of the wish of every human being to be noticed, remembered, and cherished.<br /> Although I'm a lover of good rock and roll music, I'm very aware, especially in this album, that rock and roll with its intense sound and rhythm patterns can sometimes minimize or hide the deep emotion and beauty of a song. With the Crouch End Festival Chorus and Ray's top-notch band these elements are beautifully front and center. There isn't a throw away song on this CD.<br /> In short this album is a gift to us all and I'm currently resisting the impulse to \\"wear it out\\" by playing it to death. The Kinks Choral Collection is  a piece of music to be enjoyed again and again. Thank you Ray for your courage and your vision in creating this outstanding musical experience.<br /><br />By John Daubney(Clifton Park, NY)ge and your vision in creating this outstanding musical experience.

0553210246|5.0|The Mayor of Casterbridge is not Thomas Hardy's most famous or acclaimed novel, but in the opinion of this die-hard fan it is his best. The later Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure are generally considered his masterpieces, but while this lacks their epic grandeur and sociopolitical relevance, it is more immediately arresting, has a more conventionally interesting plot, and features one of literature's best tragic heroes. I give it the highest possible recommendation not only for fans but for anyone even remotely alive to literary greatness.<br /><br />Hardy in his day was nearly unique in mixing high literary elements with what would later be called pulp factors. Hard as it is to imagine, he was like William Faulkner and Stephen King in one - a true artist with mass appeal, both critically acclaimed and bestselling. However, his early nineteenth century rural English settings, heavy dialect use, eccentric vocabulary, and other characteristics make many current readers think his books slow going. The Mayor is the obvious exception, beginning almost immediately with one of the most arresting and unforgettable scenes in all literature - nothing less than a drunken man selling his wife and child to a stranger out of anger and disgust. As often with Hardy, it is based on a real incident, but he dramatizes so vividly that we cannot help being enthralled. The drama indeed reaches such a fever pitch in these first few pages that even those normally averse to classic literature can hardly help being pulled in.<br /><br />Such a beginning sets a very high standard, and it is a testament to the book's greatness that it never disappoints - and, indeed, hardly lets up. The popular aspects of Hardy's fiction made him more influential on later writers, especially mainstream ones, than nearly any other classic author; it is almost impossible to exaggerate his impact, which is such that even many who have never read him have been greatly influenced without knowing it. These strengths are present even in his earliest fiction, but The Mayor is the preeminent example. Supremely engrossing and intriguing, it is full of plot twists that will keep even the savviest readers guessing and ends in one of the most spectacularly memorable conclusions ever. One could not expect more from even the most entertaining pulp novel - and The Mayor of course has a wealth of great artistry to boot. To be sure, this Hardy aspect has always had critics bemoaning apparent overreliance on complex plots and melodramatic coincidence, the implication being that Hardy was unable to make a story without them. However, anyone even remotely familiar with him knows that he was intensely interested in coincidence, chance, and fate, using them deliberately to dramatize what dominated his thought. Those aware of this can see how well his writings work out the implications of his bleak impressions:  that humans are near-laughably insignificant on the cosmic scale, that no force sympathetic to humans or generally benevolent controls the universe, and that human life is essentially miserable with little chance of success at love or other happiness. More specifically, his work illustrates what he called the Imminent Will - an unconscious force controlling human action. What seems luck or chance may thus be very much otherwise, though we can do nothing about it. Many have said that he has an almost malevolent attitude toward his characters, plotting so that things work out in the worst possible way and cause them the greatest possible suffering, but this is simply Hardy's view of the human condition. The Mayor's complicated plot is an essential example - perhaps the preeminent. Hardy was later somewhat unsatisfied, thinking that it suffered more from serialization's effects than any of his other novels. He worried that he included too many improbabilities and twists in an effort to include an exciting event in every installment but noted with satisfaction that the eventsarise naturally from the story, and so they do. Those who do not like this feature elsewhere will be unconvinced - or even have their view cemented -, but those for whom Hardy's tragic vision speaks powerfully will be in awe of the masterful execution.<br /><br />There are several keys to its success. Hardy reiterated over and over again that probability of character, not of action, is what matters, and this proves it. The book works mainly because its characters are so believable and often identifiable; we care about them in spite of - or arguably even because of, such is Hardy's skill - the highly-wrought events. It has one of Hardy's largest casts, and the four main characters are some of his most fully realized and memorable. Three are unsurprisingly doomed to near-constant suffering:  the admirably strong-willed and hard-working but fatally impulsive Michael Henchard; Elizabeth-Jane, who has great empathy and love potential but is so passive that others constantly step on her with impunity; and the dignified but overly passionate Lucetta. The fourth, Donald Farfrae, is one of Hardy's most original and interesting. He was not one to champion a creation, but Farfrae is probably his most thoroughly positive and genuinely likable. Other characters are drawn to him almost irresistibly, and so are we; intelligent, industrious, and positively infectious, he is drawn with a good humor almost never seen in Hardy and gives much of the book's appeal. He is also notable as a sympathetic and nuanced Scotch character from an English writer.<br /><br />But this is of course mainly Henchard's story, and what a story! Hardy based his tragic fiction on ancient Greek models, but Henchard is his only true example of the tragic hero central to those works - a character who is in many ways admirable but imbued with a flaw that proves his downfall. \\"Impulsiveness\\" perhaps sums up his and is manifested in various ways; many know such a person, but the far more important thing is that we can see ourselves in him. He is in some ways an Everyman despite obvious flaws and has several admirable qualities, not least how he raised himself from extreme poverty to relative wealth and prominence by sheer force of will. However, his fall is even greater than his rise - in fact, one of the greatest and most affecting ever imagined. It is a true testament to Hardy's artistry that he makes us care for Henchard despite him being in many ways despicable; for him to win our hearts after the opening scene seems not only impossible but perverse to even conceive, yet Hardy pulls it off. There is much to dislike, but he is fully and thus frailly and tragically human. Whether or not we think him redeemed, he is more sinned against than sinning, as even those he has wronged eventually see. Yet he also undeniably caused his own demise; what seems like bad luck or wretched fate is really his bad decisions' delayed consequences. His end is one of the most highly tragic and sympathetic ever written; he dies miserably alone and fully broken, denied even the last ray of light that a guilty conscience and sincere repentance could have potentially given. The scene with his final note - complete with misspellings belying the lack of education and humble background that made his rise more remarkable but that he was in many ways unable to overcome - is one of the most moving I have ever read. It is the culmination of what is a highly emotional work throughout; Hardy runs us through a gamut of feelings as only he can. The pathos is at times almost unbearable, and few readers will not cry at least once. Indeed, aside from Les Mis&eacute;rables, which I believe is unquestionably the greatest creation of all-time, no other book out of the hundreds or thousands I have read has moved me so often or deeply. Other than Victor Hugo, Hardy has no equal at conveying emotion, and this is his supreme example. Later works, particularly Tess, show the tragedy of the human condition on a grander scale, but only Oedipus Rex itself even rivals this as a supremely moving depiction of individual tragedy. Indeed, I can say without hyperbole that nothing else I have ever experienced - artistic or otherwise - has driven home life's profound tragedy with such conviction or force.<br /><br />This alone is of course more than enough reason to read the book, but the work is also notable for other reasons. Chief among these is another perennial Hardy strength - great sense of place. Perhaps no one equals him in making place so vivid that it is essential to the story; setting is never mere background with him. He is of course best-known in this regard for Wessex - the part-real, part-dream country based on his native Southwest England that he made world famous. Setting is not as important here as in some other works, but the Casterbridge focus is particularly noteworthy. Based on the real-life Dorchester, Casterbridge is Wessex's largest town; nearly all Wessex stories and a considerable number of the poems mention it, and many take place there in part. However, this is unique in being almost entirely set there, giving both a fascinating glimpse into Southwest England's early nineteenth-century hub and filling in much of the background to other works. This is invaluable to fans and of considerable interest to historians and others.<br /><br />Relatedly, Hardy's work is well-known for showing modernity's ache, i.e., how technology and other advances were rapidly and drastically changing a society that had been essentially the same for a thousand years. The Mayor in particular portrays its effect on agriculture and other business aspects, depicting all with realism and human interest. Some current readers may think this makes the book drag somewhat, but it will be a big attraction for others, especially those keen on the background to the book and its importance to Hardy's life and thought.<br /><br />I simply cannot praise the novel highly enough; it is one of the all-time greatest artistic achievements, a supreme creation of artistry and, more fundamentally, the human heart. Suffice it to say that anyone sensitive to the unforgettable final two paragraphs, which sum up Hardy's grim but eminently practical view of existence in his fine inimitable style and conclude by calling happiness \\"the occasional episode in a general drama of pain,\\" will not find the sentiments more vividly dramatized anywhere. This is enough - perhaps even all anyone could ask for.<br /><br />As for this edition, it is essentially bare bones, lacking even Hardy's Preface, though it has a bibliography. The dedicated will want something more extensive, but the work more than stands on its own.e is in some ways an Everyman despite obvious flaws and has several admirable qualities, not least how he raised himself from extreme poverty to relative wealth and prominence by sheer force of will.

B001OQCV2E|1.0|President Obama must see this movie \\"2012\\" and this film would teach him a lesson for our critical human survival that make the space colonization so vital.    Famous deaf Russian Konstantin Tsiolkovsky - the grandfather of modern astronautics and the Russian Jules Verne quoted that \\"Earth is the cradle of mankind, but one cannot live in the cradle forever.\\"   Therefore, we cannot live forever on the only human life-support planet Earth.  The NASA space program is truly essential for the survival of American civilization and the world humanity.  We must continue to go beyond our fragile life-support planet Earth to explore in outer space in order to preserve our species of homo-sapiens by spreading out and creating human colonies in the vast universe in order to save our humanity from its extinction. We must speedily up to build a whole fleet of starships to evacuate the people and animals from dying Earth, and leave the planet Earth quickly before the planet Earth will rupture and obliterate our human civilization in 2012.     US government, especially today's President Obama, has a lack of vision in setting priorities for the human space exploration and colonization since early 1970s.  We are to be permanently stuck on Earth in secluded.  Our species of homo-sapiens will be at stake for our planetary survival in the critical crisis.     Why does Obama want us to wait two or three decades to send humans to the planet Mars, and other planets and satellites that support life?  Then it will be too little and too late for America to send humans on planetary exploration and colonization.  Our species of homo-sapiens cannot survive beyond the apocalypse year of 2012.  Thanks to socialist-minded President Obama for delaying NASA manned space program for a few decades and leave us to die wretchedly on doomsday Earth on 2012.

B000127LW2|2.0|Bashing Voyager is pretty much the national pastime as far as Trek is concerned.  People warned me away from this show for years.  My thinking was \\"how bad could it be?  It was on the air for seven seasons without getting cancelled.\\"  After seeing this season, my question is \\"Why didn't it get cancelled?  The writing is some of the worst I've ever seen in my life.  It was almost like they were trying to write a bad plot in every episode.  I don't like too many of the characters that much, except for the Doctor.  Janeway is a worse captain than the Enterprise-B captain from Generations.     Okay, let me start at the beginning.  The new U.S.S. Voyager and a Maquis ship get caught in some kind of nexus-like thing and are transported to the delta quadrant.  They find some guy called the caretaker who transports ships to himself....for some reason.  They find the Caretaker and have the opportunity to use his technology to get back home, but no.  Janeway says they have to destroy the array because they have to keep it from being used by the Kazon.  Which, without question, goes against the prime directive.  You know, that federation law, which says we aren't allowed to interfere in other cultures?  Janeway says that \\"We're already involved\\" and blows the array to bits.  If she absolutely had to destroy the array, why didn't she stay behind and do it herself?  Or make a fuse or something.  But no, Janeway did what she does best.  She took a situation with a fairly obvious solution and instead of going with that solution, she followed the solution that was the most idiotic.  She continues to do that throughout the season.  I'm not a big fan of the thing with Voyager being stranded far from home.  I don't see why this is any different from TOS or TNG where they're out exploring the unknown.  They're doing the exact same thing here, except they are also trying to find a way to get home.  This is supposed to make the series new and exciting, but to me it just made it worse.  Because we're going to have all these \\"will voyager make it home\\" episodes.  And since it isn't the series finale, we know they aren't going to make it home.  Not yet, anyway.  In a way, this almost makes the series depressing, because we know these morons are going to have to spend the next seven years with each other.     Along those lines, let me talk about the characters.  As I said earlier, I love the Doctor.  Picardo steals every scene he is in, with his horrible bedside manner and his sarcasm.  But other than him, there's almost no character I like.  There were some characters I thought were okay.  Kes is supposed to be this sweet, likeable character that everyone likes.  And she is, except when she's annoying about it.  She cares about the doctor, and wants to make him as comfortable as possible.  Why?  He's a hologram, nothing more.  He's not someone who needs to be comforted or cuddled.  Kes is sweet, yes, but moronically so.  Tuvok was okay, I guess.  He's really nothing more than your standard Vulcan.  There really isn't anything about him that makes him any different than Spock.  Except that he's a lot less interesting than Spock.  It was like they had to come up with an idea for a new character, and they were tired so they said \\"Why don't we just throw a Vulcan into the mix?  We haven't had a Vulcan in the last two shows.\\"  The thing is, I think most Vulcans are kind of bland.  All they do is repeat \\"logic\\" and \\"no emotion\\".  What made Spock so interesting was the fact that he is half-human, and strives to constantly keep his human side in check.  But other than him, I don't find most Vulcans very interesting.  And Tuvok is no exception.  Torres is okay, but why is it that almost every Trek series has to have a crew member of a mixed race?  It's been done before.  Except now we get a half-human, half-klingon chick.  She has to struggle to keep her klingon side in check, blah blah blah........like I said, we've seen this before.  It's already been done,and done better.  The last character I didn't hate is Chakotay.  He isn't a great character, to say the least.  And he seems to have a crush on Janeway, since he goes along with every retarded plan she comes up with.  But I found his character to be somewhat interesting.  Although sometimes they get a little bit racist with his animal guide stuff.     I hate Harry Kim and Tom Paris.  I thought Tom's background was kind of interesting, but he is by far the worst actor on this show.  And that's saying something.  Whenever he delivers a well-written line (which isn't often given the writing) it backfires because the guy simply cannot act.  He's horrible.  The guy who plays Harry Kim is not much better, but the problems I have with his character are more the writing than the bad performance.  Harry Kim is the nerd that you knew in high school who always got stuffed in a locker by the jocks.  He's the butt of every joke, and I wish they would just kill him off already and put him out of his misery.  But the two worst characters in this show by far are Janeway and Neelix.  The sad thing is, neither one of these actors are bad.  Both of them are decent actors.  But their characters are written so badly.  Let's start with Neelix.  Neelix is more annoying than Jar Jar Binks and Wesley Crusher combined.  He weasel's his way onto the ship first as a guide, and then as morale officer.  He imposes his authority over everyone, including Janeway.  And you want to know the most infuriating part of all this?  Everyone goes along with it!!  The only one who ever takes a stand against this jerk is Seska, and she's evil.  And since she also hates Janeway for getting them lost in the first place....I might be in love with her.  Along those lines, Janeway is a horrible captain.  She faces any problem, big or small, and does the following.  She searches for the most destructive, painful solution that will probably be the most destructive and cause the biggest loss of life.  And she alwayshas to go out of her way to get all these worthless people onto the ship.  Like when she got Tom Paris out of the penal colony to come with them on the mission, for absolutely no reason.  And why does she integrate the Maquis into the Voyager crew?  Why not do what any sensible captain would do and throw them in the brig?  She puts Chakotay, a renegade, in the first officer position, rather than Tuvok, who has had starfleet training and is the second officer.     Another problem this show has is the lack of effective villians.  The two groups of villians are the Kazon and the Viidians.  The Kazon are a joke.  They are complete and utter morons.  The Viidians are kind of interesting, because they're not necessarily bad.  They're just doing what they have to to survive.  But just like the Kazon, they are not very smart.  The only villian I liked was Seska.  The reason she is so effective is because she's so smart.  Or it could be that she looks smart when compared to the Kazon and the Viidians.  Voyager is a bad show, because both the writing and the characters are horrible.  How this crap ran for seven seasons is beyond me.  But I've said all that to say this:  I actually found myself enjoying this show.  It's one of the worst things I've ever seen, but for some reason I like it.  A lot of the episodes had crappy storylines, but only because they didn't make good use of what they had.  They would have an interesting idea, and then dump bad writing or cliches on top of that.  This was not a good season, but it was at least better than season one of TNG.  Man, that season was the textbook definition of bad Science Fiction.  And TNG eventually did develop into a very good series.  Maybe I'll find the later seasons of Voyager enjoyable too.
B000002G7E|3.0|My life as a Velvet Underground fan up to this point has been a short one. I became interested in the band two months ago and purchased their legendary first album a month later. This month, I managed to find White Light/White Heat, the follow-up to their first album. Given how innovative and, well, astounding, their first album was, the band had a lot to live up to. Was this album good? Yes. Was it as good as the first one? No, but that doesn't mean that it has to be, and with that mindset, I gave this album a listen. The album opens with the title track: a blend of the band's iconic brand of proto-punk and noise rock combined with the peppiness of a 50s rock tune. It's catchy, to say the least, and makes you want to get up and dance for the entire thing. The second track is \\"The Gift\\", which isn't a song, but a sort of monotone narration by bassist John Cale of a short story written by songwriter Lou Reed. The premise of putting spoken words against a musical backdrop isn't anything new but the VU somehow managed to make this \\"song\\" unique with its melodic yet unassuming soundtrack and interesting story. \\"Lady Godiva's Operation\\" is another quirky piece of concept music. The song starts off as extremely mellow with Cale providing some Nico-inspired vocals and guitarist Sterling Morrison strumming in his, what I call, \\"heroin-addicted surf rocker\\" style. It goes into sort of a loop until Reed breaks the cycle and joins Cale in the song's climax. One of the things I love about the VU's music is how visual it can be, and this song proves it. \\"Here She Comes Now\\" acts as more of a segue into the second side (or last two tracks) of the album. It's a nice, relaxing song, albeit forgettable. Tracks five is where things start to pick up, and by \\"pick up\\", I mean prepare you for the beast-of-a-track you need to conquer. Listening to \\"I Heard Her Call My Name\\" was like waiting in line to go on the world's most dangerous roller coaster, only there's noise rock playing as youwait in line. The vocal parts borrow some 50s rock influences like the first track, but the guitar parts teeter on the line between music and noise. Now come the Big One: Sister Ray, a track that clocks in at a whopping 17:27. If you didn't think the last track was heavy enough, you're in for one long ride. The song holds your attention during the first 3 minutes, but drifts off in a sea of droning music. The last five minutes of the song is a prime example of controlled chaos: noisy, primal chaos. If you manage to listen to the entire track, consider yourself a hero.    I would give the album a 3.5/5 if the system on Amazon would let me, but I'll have to settle with 3 stars. For those of you that want to further explore the experimental style of the Velvet Underground, this is a good follow-up to the pervious album...that is, if you're ready.

B002ZTIIXK|5.0|RECOLLECTION<br /><br />It was a snow day, school was closed, I had a steaming cup of hot coffee and the TV on.  Not being able to watch morning shows, I was enjoying one of the many AM programs when k.d. Lang was introduced.  Having never heard much of her music, I didn't pay much attention until ------- until she started to belt out CONSTANT CRAVING.  WOW!  I was enchanted, blown away, stopped in my tracks.  What a voice.<br /><br />I ran up to the computer room and immediately ordered this CD.  I have listened to it every day since then.  This woman can sing.  From soft, light rock, to the stirring and hauntingly beautiful HALLELUJAH, she never disappoints and always evokes emotions.  Another highlight on this CD is CRYING with the late great Roy Orbison.  CRYING has always been a favorite of mine, having Orbison and Lang sing it together is a double treat.<br /><br />I didn't know what I was missing in the music world until I received this CD.  There's not a song on there I don't like, it's a great bargain for a two set CD.  Some of my favorites are CONSTANT CRAVING, MISS CHATELAINE, HALLELUJAH, CRYING, and HELP ME.  The more I listen to this CD, the more I like it.  Lang's jazzy, strong, bluesey, down-to-earth voice can make any song listening pleasure.<br /><br />This is a wonderful CD from a very talented singer.  Treat yourself and get yourself this CD set.  ENJOY.<br /><br />Pam
B00007K02F|4.0|I am a big Jane Eyre fan. I have read the book countless times and seen all the adaptations that are available on DVD and I have to say that I enjoyed this one. It isn't as good as the 2006 one but it is still good. I liked the Adele in this movie better than the 2006 one and the acting by most of the characters in this movie is done very well. I showed this one to my boyfriend to get him acquainted with the story and he actually liked it even though he hates most \\"chick flicks\\". The music in this adaptation is beautiful.
044654146X|5.0|I can't rave enough about this book.  It is well-researched and documents the accounts of Israeli entrepreneurs and how they got to where they are.  It also explains how the United States is so dependent on Israel for technology and why.    It helped me understand how and why Israelis think and act the way they do. The authors did a terrific job of keeping my interest until the end--I wanted the book to go on and on; I simply couldn't put it down! Initially, I borrowed the book from my local library; when I was half-way through the book I ordered it from Amazon and returned my copy to the library.  I want my entire family to read it.  I can't recommend it highly enough for anyone who wants to learn more about Israel.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillians 30 day shred will definitely kick your butt.  The only disadvantage is that it is the same routine so I did some modifying myself so it wouldn't be so boring.
B00383YC2S|5.0|The \\"Une Enfant Du Siecle\\" project was indeed a risky move for Alizee. Collaborating with Chateau Marmont and other prominent electronica genre artists, Alizee produced a musical gem from the first to last track. I think that Alizee was brilliant in her selection of composers and lyricists that hold true to her Edie Sedgewick theme while maintaining a universal interpretive appeal. Though I remain a fan of her previous three studio projects, I favor Une Enfant Du Siecle for its commitment to a single genre, songs that are rich with quality melodies and smart lyrics. A definite triumph...Bravo...Alizee!
0385342039|5.0|I loved this book! I didn't want to put it down.  Sadie was a great character- quirky, fun, daring, a little annoying. I loved the way that Lara's personality grew throughout the story. It was part fun, part romance and part mystery...a light, fun read that you will enjoy!
B0039OGGVQ|4.0|So one night I hear \\"By The Sword\\" on the radio, and find out that it was a track from a new solo album by Slash.  I decided to get some more info about the album, and discovered that Lemmy, Chris Cornell, Dave Grohl and Ozzy (among many others) contributed to the album.  That was enough for me, I just bought it.  I sure wasn't disappointed, this is a great album any hard rock fan will enjoy.
B0000DJZB9|5.0|If you're a GN'R fan like me I think you should definitely consider adding this to your collection.    I love almost every video on it (except for the last one that's some really old cover song).  Also not a fan of \\"Gaden of Eden\\" in which Axl tries to sing as fast as humanly possible for no apparent reason.  Otherwise it's exceptional.    If you're reading this you almost certainly view GN'R as one of the greatest metal bands of all time.  I'd rate Axl as one of my two favorite male singers/performers.  Bruce Dickinson is the only guy I feel can manage to surpass Axl's stunning talent.
B002A4Q652|5.0|And it's hard not to notice that she also has great physical beauty.    I've never considered myself a fan of symphonic metal, though I am impressed by the album.  Charolette is so young and talented that I think she's going to be around for quite some time.    I appreciate her clear vocals.  I can't stand metal in which incoherent screaming is deemed to qualify as \\"singing.\\"  I can scream too -- it doesn't take skill.    This review is from a guy who's been a fan of Iron Maiden & Guns N' Roses for a quarter century.    This music is clearly more upbeat than your standard Maiden tune that is almost always about war and/or death.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have always loved dystopian scifi novels. In the HUNGER GAMES. Katniss a resident of the poor District 12 is chosen to fight on live TV in the hunger games. a contest in which 2 tributes of each of the 12 districts. fight to the death only 1 may survive. The book is action packed suspenseful and quite the drama. Whether you have read other suzanne collins books or have not. you will be struck by the intricate viewings of the effects of war on us kids. The book paints with quite a broad stroke and Panem is quite a horrific place.  Suzanne collins also wrote gregor the overlander.
0575079932|3.0|This is my first Philip Dick Novel, and I must say while I enjoyed it, I somehow expected more. It certainly makes you appreciate our present biodiversity, but while you expect it to be suspenseful and exciting, it fails to deliver and is at times anti-climatic.  Nonetheless, it was interesting.  I'm looking forward to reading his other works.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Hello to everyone who reads this. I have bought from Amazon over 125 Blu-ray titles by now.. and this would be my first ever review on a Blu-ray title if I am not mistaken I think I did one review on \\"Short Circuit \\"  not sure. I still didn't get my \\"Avatar\\" Blu-ray from Amazon, as at the time I am writing this, it is 04-21-2010 12:37PM on PST. I should receive my copy of \\"Avatar\\" Blu-ray tomorrow which is 04-22-2010 on it's official  schedule release on \\"Earth's day\\". Yet I received a copy of it on Blu-ray yesterday from another very well known source to me which  I can't mention  here due to legal street issues date. Firstly I have to let you all know that my friends TV is calibrated and this review is mainly based from what I see on my friends calibrated  TV settings. ( in other words if your TV is not yet been calibrated please don't blame my review after watching \\"Avatar\\" on your none-calibrated TV )  Let me start with just saying this UNBELIEVABLE quality. I have no idea how Mr. Cameron did it. This is the best-ever Blu-ray title  that I have ever witness. Just amazing and mind blowing ( Waiting on Star Wars Blu-ray set and hoping it will have the same quality knowing Mr. G.Lucas )  It took my breath away. ( I think I disturb my friend Gary many times while watching the movie by parsing the quality of it) Mainly I take my hat off to Mr.Cameron for  giving the viewers of \\"Avatar\\" experience by taking off all that Hollywood crap out from the menu which they usually adds... and cheers again  for that Mr.Cameron. Cheers a lot for having respect for viewers. Cheers again  for giving us a such a nice treat we appreciate your art with great respect. My ratings on video quality I gave it a Five Stars, Audio Quality I gave it a Five Stars, Overall Blu-ray quality I gave it a Five Stars,Overall for the movie 'Avatar\\" Five Stars and Two thumbs up.<br /><br />  I do also know that the release on 22nd of \\"Avatar\\" will not have the extra Forty Five minutes. But Mr.Cameron were nice enough to let us know way-ahead about it so we can make our choice of which version to by such as April 22nd release or the late November 'Avatar\\"  Directors Cut release. Therefore we will not have to double dip-it.  ( Not many in Hollywood movie industry does give that early information  of a late \\"Directors Cut\\" release before they release their very first title release, they always grab our money by releasing a late \\"Directors Cut\\" with a surprise )  Also I will not forget to thank the \\"Fox\\" Studio for releasing the Blu-ray for $ 19.99. Where they would have unarguably sold it for very easily over $ 26.99 ( which is considering with the cost of the movie/even though they covered in Two weeks of the opening well as thinking  of other prices of some  not so good new releases ) My hats off to you on that \\"Fox\\" Studio. Still there is one thing that bugs me and I am sad or rather upset about what \\"Fox' Studio did. Which is stated here by me. ( this is only my opinion and does not say I am right here, but it's a strong opinion ) We here in USA produce all the Blockbusters  and still England and Europe gets the best deal and pricing why?. I don't know. It is a Million Dollar question for me. Example \\"Avatar\\" in England gets a choice to buy the Blu-ray/DVD combo pack with a Steel Book and other survival guide book of \\"Avatar\\"  for British Pounds 24.99 which is $38.00 at today's currency exchange rate. Or else they can buy just the Blu-ray at a cheaper price.  It might be expensive for most of us yet the choice would have been give to us in  the USA market too. And most of other titles that are released in England and Europe they always  gets a very good buying options well as good pricing too... mainly Amazon UK. Then-again this is only my opinion like I have mentioned above. What I am trying to say here is.... we the USA make these films and such choice should have been given to us in USA too in-definitely . I have pre-ordered the USA and the UK version of it..the UK version was ordered because I wanted the Steel Book Edition. But if the choice was given to the USA market I would have saved the $38.00 that I have spend on the UK \\"Steel Book Edition' as it would  helped me on the long-run as I am going to buy the \\"Avatar\\" November \\"Directors Cut\\" release too. There-after if they release a 3D version I will not buy it because the movie was not shot on 3D camera. But still it would have help me if we in USA had the choice overall. My European version of \\"Avatar\\" Blu-ray will not go a waist as I will keep the steel book and give the Blu-ray to my nephew who lives in Spain. ( For those who are waiting for a good 3D movie... in 2011 Mr. Michael Bay's \\"Transformer 3 \\" is the best why!!!... he is shooting it in the real way how it is meant to be shot. With 2D and 3D dual lens anamorphic camera. Just a tip for fans.<br /><br />  Overall my anonymous respect goes to Mr. Cameron for taking us into a such a wonderful,unforgettable  excursion in life. Million thanks to you again. And cheers to \\"Fox\\" Studio for keeping the price at $ 19.99 for Blu-ray and DVD combo pack. ( at Amazon )  And thanks for the great production crew of this movie \\"Avatar\\"... well as let us not forget to thank the Geeks who work in it too without them there wouldn't be a \\"Avatar\\" movie. Cheers to all of you. I will not have to write in here asking people to buy it within another week time  if you read [...] I am very sure this will be the ( AVATAR ) most sold Blu-ray title in currant Blu-ray  history. Enjoy your \\"AVATAR\\" copy. Please if you can try  and calibrate  your TV before you watch it,  calibrate your sound system and watch it ON DTS-HD ( UNCOMPRESSED sound ) Those who doesn't have Blu-ray system and 1080P TV with their own good reasons... whenever time permits you please buy it as this is how movies are meant to be watch. I thank you all a lot for reading my review on \\"Avatar\\" Blu-ray. Take care may  Peace Prevail On Earth.

B00003CX5P|2.0|Like a lot of people who love the New Hope and the following films, I was thrilled when George Lucas produced episodes 1-3. I want to like the additions to the Star Wars saga. But they just don't measure up. I'm sure for some fans of Star Wars this movie is rich in plot twists, special effects and very enjoyable. But for me they aren't even in the same league as the original Star Wars movies. For me, a great movie starts with characters you love (or hate) and they are placed on a 2 hour ride the draws you into their world and gives you a vested interest in the characters. This movie doesn't do that for me and although I have seen parts of episodes 1-3 on TV and watched for a little while, I never find enough interest and flip the channel.    I'm sure many people will enjoy Star Wars Episode I, the Phantom Menace. But it just makes me want to watch the original Star Wars and the movie magic that was captured in 6 hours of ground breaking film. This film is like New Coke; it makes me love Classic Coke all the more.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|Maybe this is a preview or an opinion as it hasn't been released yet, and people have already talked about Oprah's narration. But another and just as important point to me - look at the running time. Then look at the Attenborough version. 440 minutes versus 550?    I know which one I'll be getting. I felt ripped off last time - on the American Planet Earth release we did get Attenborough, but got 4 discs instead of 5 on the U.K. version. I knew there was no chance at a refund, but I bought the U.K. one as well anyway when I found out after waiting for a special. Thankfully this time around I won't be caught out.    I don't understand why now that everything's digital and there's no PAL and NTSC any more or different resolutions, why we can't just have the same releases throughout the different territories. And when Americans have no problem with many of the latest blockbusters having an ostensibly all - English (or at least British sounding accents - the Pirates movies, Lord of the Rings, Narnia, Harry Potter and so on) cast why we have this patronising stuff. Back to the days of Mad Max 2/Road Warrior and dubbing Mel Gibson eh?! Different masters can be good though to show us when things break down. I was bitterly disappointed in the Good the Bad and the Ugly quality, especially after seeing how amazing the European version is. And I'm still cranky about no refund on the appalling first release of Gangs of New York on Blu.    So now I'm more wary, and I vote British on this one.
B0034C9CFK|4.0|Alan Jackson's new album, Freight Train, proves he's still the real deal. I have purchased probably eight of his albums in the past, and this one does not disappoint. I hope he keeps pumping them out at least once per year for many years to come.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|This was the greatest Sherlock Holmes movie I have every seen. This is exactly how Sir Doyle would have done this movie if he was alive today. If you are a true Sherlock Holmes buff you will love this movie. And Please do not base this movie with the old Basil Rarthbone ones. That is like comparing apples to oranges.  Robert Downey Jr. is the new Sherlock Holmes. I can wait until they make the next one. I will be the first in line to see it. And you will be right behind me.
6305076995|4.0|I've been a Yes-fan as long as i can remember. This stunning dvd shows Yes at their best. The sound could be better though but it has it's charm at times. It's amazing how musicians like Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman play like they do and the voice of Jon Anderson is<br />flawless. All in all the dvd is a trademark of progressive rock and how it should be played.
0385341008|5.0|I have never been moved to write a review on anything at Amazon - or any other web site for that matter - until I read this book. A friend recommended it to me, and told me I would love it. She had just finished it and insisted I read it. Well, I finished it in 2 sittings in 2 days and I can't tell you how thoroughly I enjoyed it. Wonderful, delightful, lovely. I want so badly to go directly to Guernsey and spend time at Isola's and run in the field with Kit. When I finished it I felt as if I had made 10 new friends in Guernsey (and London, too!). What an absolute treasure - and I don't throw terms like that around that easily. As a single 30-something myself, Juliet is someone to aspire to.<br /><br />I rate it in my top 5 favorite books of all time. If you liked The Notebook, you'll like this.<br /><br />Buy it, forthwith! I will be doing same, for everyone I know. Enjoy this little piece of magic.<br /><br />Betsy

B0031TZ8TU|3.0|The story was interesting, but the editing was pretty poor. There were constant grammatical mistakes, like \\"had got\\" or \\"Rashid looked really shook.\\" Let me know if you need help, Mr. Follett, I'd work cheaply.
0439023491|2.0|While I did like this, it seemed as though this WHOLE book really could have been condensed into the first two or three chapters of a second and final piece rather than this being a trilogy...It was probably an editor (re: publisher) wanting more product at the expense of the art.<br /><br />I will not detail the plot/storyline, the story is one that should be read, but be forewarned, it is in NO WAY nearly as engaging as the first and as I hope the last to be.<br /><br />A necessary book to read as the overall story is a good one, but complete fluff fills the binding...(pretty predictable route the story is taking too...)
0399250395|3.0|As an Eric Carle fan I was excited to order this 'new' version of the old classic. I should have stayed with the tried & true. The pop-up book is much larger than I anticipated & more importantly the pop-ups themselves are too intricate & complicated & leave nothing to the imagination, which is a primary purpose of those wonderful Carle books.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|The \\"Life\\" special is fantastic, and it's so good that I recommend you run out and get a copy now- a proper copy, narrated by Sir David Attenborough. Not this Oprah-narrated atrocity.<br /><br />Simply put, the international and aired version of the \\"Life\\" special is narrated by a man who's dedicated his life to wildlife and conservation. Attenborough is a seasoned veteran in the field, whose years of experience and worldwide known calm voice lend to some of the most amazing narratives that pair with amazing visuals to create perfect viewing experiences.<br /><br />This version, however, is narrated by Oprah. Instead of insightful comments from someone's who's been in the field and participated in the project, you get random comments that have nothing to do with the project from someone who has very little idea what's going on. The script seems like it was written for children, or illiterate adults who can't watch these beautiful images without someone yelling \\"OH NO!\\" to keep them awake.<br /><br />The visuals are still beautiful, but buying and watching this version is saying that you have no problem being told that you are stupid. Marketing execs decided you were too dumb to understand a British accent, and that having Oprah's name on this would sell more copies than having the name of the man most associated with these projects worldwide. Stand up, demand the Attenborough version, and in the process demand that the movie industry treat you as an intelligent being.
B0037W68F4|3.0|I have loved MGMT ever since I heard \\"Kids\\" last year. It was just powerful even though you couldn't make any sense out of it. It's basically the same here with many of the songs. But it's a great album of Sixties-style, psychedelic trippiness. Great album, but MGMT coulda done just a tad better.
B001NESPHC|5.0|My husband bought me this album on LP and I like it so much I am buying it on CD as well. The clarity and tone in Melody's voice is soothing. Very classic jazz sound, but refreshing original scores and lyrics. I highly recommend this album as a great addition to any jazz collection.
B002N1AEN2|4.0|It's great of course in that spacemen 3 kind of way. Dreamy, groovy but after a while begins to sound the same, as if the closing songs are rewrites of the openers--maybe they are, I don't know yet after only two listens. I do like it a LOT but it doesn't knock me out as the best or even one of the best of the year. If you like hypnotic, groovy guitars and sleepy sexy vocals, you can't go wrong.
0312330855|5.0|The book All Creatures Great and Small is a great story by an interesting author, James Herriot. On Amazon, there are almost no legitimate arguments against this great story. The positive reviews love the story because it really gives the reader a sense of what James Herriot is thinking as he tells his own stories. This book is in fact a multi-million copy bestseller, being loved by almost any book critic that has reviewed this great story.<br /><br />As a 14 year old reading this book for school, it is very interesting to read about all of the experiences that James goes through when working as a veterinary surgeon in a small town in England in the early 1900's. He shares all his experiences working with the animals of the many farmers in their town. James is just starting out as an intern at the beginning of the book, and has to face all of the social aspects of farmers not expecting him, the new guy, but expecting his boss, Siegfried Farnon. Farnon is an extremely forgetful man. Often, anything that James messes up, he will forget by the next day. This can become problematic when he gives Herriot advice, but the next day forgets what that advice was and gives Herriot completely new, contradicting advice. The way that James Herriot really exposes  the reader to every aspect of working in his new job is what makes this book such a joy to read. One of my favorite stories is when Farnon's brother, Tristan,  destroys two of Farnon's cars within one day.<br /><br />One of the reasons that James Herriot wrote All Creatures Great and Small is to show the importance of perseverance. James has to perform many unpleasant tasks throughout the story, including getting up at very strange hours for an emergency case, or completing a daunting task that usually takes hours with little reward afterwards. All of this shows that he had to persevere in order to accomplish his dream, and illustrates the lesson: never give up. James Herriot accomplishes this goal amazingly. Every chapter shows his hardships, and that he never gives up throughout the entire story.

B0030BYWKK|4.0|Thought I would love it but I don't. It's pretty cool but very hippie-ish and can't say I'll listen to it a lot.
B001FB5634|4.0|What makes this story so good is that it's as real as it can be.  There are no special effects, no heroes, no computer generated fight scenes.  It's just a film about a man and his son, against what's left of the world and anyone else that has survived in it.  It's not a pretty film; it's not a romantic film, but still it's hauntingly touching and realistic.     The film is dark, and at times, there are a few scenes in the film that are disturbing and hard to stomach.  Overall, the movie did leave a lasting impression on me.  How could it not?  In the midst of a disaster, what's the scariest thing in the world one could be faced with? For me, the answer to this question would be trying to save your child's life, and trying to survive and hold onto your own life for the sake of saving that child's life.    You want action and animated special effects? Don't see this film. If you are looking for something a little more realistic, a little more human (cause let's face it, in real life people die, people don't conveniently find guns laying around when they need it and we all don't posses the ability to flip up in the air and bounce off walls, if we're faced with a life or death situation) then, hey this film could be for you.      Here's a fair warning for those who have children or that are surrounded by children in their lives, this film may depress you and may even make you cry.  It may even give you insight on the lives of homeless people, but that's just my opinion.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|I have to admit that I saw the film three times in 3D at the theater.  Twice was IMAX.  With popcorn and drinks, I spent a lot of money and never had a regret.  My blueray disc was delivered two hours ago and I am watching it as I write.  It is spectacular.  Will I buy the the 3D version when it comes out?  Yup. I wouldn't want to miss all the times I'll get to watch it while I'm waiting.  If you liked the film in the theater, just get it.  Give your old copy as a gift for XMAS and get the new one then.
0545123267|5.0|I gave this book as a gift to my 10 year old neice, and here is what she had to say about it (these are her own words):        \\"I really liked this book a lot.  The characters are real to me and it has plenty of action and romance.  I like Grace and Sam, and I like the way they are meant to be together from the beginning.  Sam saved Grace a couple of years earlier, and has loved her ever since.  How sweet!  Sam won't be a wolf for much longer and he tries to spend all his time with Grace while he can.  He sings to her.  The chapters are short, so I can read a few of them after my homework is done and before dinner, making the time go by faster.  I recommend this book to anyone who likes werewolves!\\"
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Lovely engaging film for little ones and those who love them.  True to the book with  clever adpatation of a challenging concept; an entire civilization on a dust mote.  Great book - great movie!
B0002XH9Z4|4.0|have alot of mj's cds and this is a very good box set with a hard cover book.
B000002LFU|3.0|I realize why I never was interested in REM in the first place.  They exploded in popularity at a time when their musical style became excessively commercial and unappealing.  The first song I ever heard was \\"Stand,\\" and I totally loved it.  Then I heard \\"Losing My Religion,\\" and that's where they totally lost me.  I still kind of like this album as a whole, because it has some superb songs on it which give it a major boost, like Pop Song 89, Get Up, and Stand.  But it's sad and depressing tunes like Orange Crush that make me want to turn the radio off and go to bed.  I have Murmur, which is a great album, but it seems as if everything after this album is just not worth a listen, with the exception of a handful of really upbeat tunes.  I can't say for sure whether or not they sold out, as I don't know their history or intentions, but I would personally stick with only their classic albums.

0375842209|4.0|I am a student in high school, and I found that The Book Thief showed the world how children often have to be mature beyond their years. At a young age, Liesl has already lost her mother and brother, and has to begin with a new family. She is scared and her new home is somewhat frightening to her at first. For the rest of her young life, she has to stay and live and breathe and eat with these new complete strangers by the name of Hans and Rosa Hubermann. She has little education and little left to hold on to. However, she finds joy in the simple act of reading, and although many books were banned under the rule of the Nazis, she found books in one way or another.   Some readers of the book found the point of view of Death to be silly and confusing. I, on the other hand, found that this aspect of the book gave it an interesting and unexpected twist that sets it apart from so many other nonfiction Holocaust books. I found that in this way, the author was able to make `The Book Thief' unique.   Other readers also thought that the German language thrown into the storyline made the story more interesting and original. I agree for the most part, but I also must say that at times this made reading more difficult. I couldn't always understand what was happening in the story because of certain points where German was used too often.    I thought that the greatest aspect of the book was Liesl's and Max Vanderburg's relationship. They were both so alike, and at the same time couldn't be more different. They were both not always accepted by others around them and had lost their original families. The only difference was that Max was a Jew, and therefore an outcast, but the Hubermann family accepted him anyways.   I would recommend this book to anyone in high school and older, because it can give one a different perspective of life, especially when seen through a young, troubled child's eyes.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I'd seen this movie more than a few times when I decided to buy it on blu-ray in order test a new big screen TV.    Regarding the story, it was pretty good and well worth seeing but not as good as \\"Wrath of Khan\\".  If you want a synopsis, sorry, I'm not writing one.  There are too many excellent ones just a quick search away.    As for the movie on blu-ray - WOW!  I've seen it in theaters, in planes, on DVD, etc, but never in high-def.  The detail was simply incredible.  I'm glad I was so familiar with the story because I was focused on all sorts of little viewing details.  The movie was definitely shot in a manner that transferred well to high def.  During the first scenes I was distracted by the actor's complexions.  Amazing.  Just amazing.    In summary, if you haven't seen this movie then you should see it.  If you haven't seen it in high-def, you should do that too.
0307463745|5.0|Great Book,<br /><br />Having built several business and searching for the next big thing in business, I purchased REWORK on a recommendation from Tim Ferris Author of (The Four Hour Work Week). I soon discovered that the next big thing in business was really something that has never gone away. Starting your business on the basic fundamentals tought from this book will lead to great results from real people. Reading this book brought back memories of Tom Cruise in Jerry Mcguire (1996) starting his own sports management company. Buy this book today!
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I had read a challenging question once. If you could have one of the following wishes granted, which would you take? Money, Power or Respect. Walt White has none of these advantages but because he has knowledge, Walt is able to score all three. Walt missed his chance to fulfill his potential a long time ago because of stubbornness. Now he has a lifestyle that is very routine and unchallenging. His in-laws seem to remind him of his inadequacies often. As do his high school students who he fails to reach despite his passion for science versus life. When he finds out that he has lung cancer and has a chance encounter with a former student (that he has nothing in common with)... the stage is set to start earning extra money manufacturing drugs.<br /><br />I was wandering Borders with a 40% coupon and I happened upon Season One of Breaking Bad. I went to Amazon on my phone and discovered the following: About 60 reviews and most of them gave it all 5 stars. Outstanding. In one weekend I watched them all under ideal conditions: I had a cough that wouldn't die. I had empathy for Walter White. The funny thing is, I don't normally like movies about the drug trade. I don't like good people who crash and burn. When that person is reluctant and their decline is spread out over a long period of time, then it's like watching a train wreck in super slow mo. I believe it when it's a process, not a sharp 180 crammed into 46 minutes minus commercials. Also, the way Walt uses his science smarts to turn the tables on his enemies during confrontations makes for the best television I've seen in years. MacGyver insults your intelligence. Walt makes you feel smarter than James Freaking Bond.<br /><br />Season Two: The best thing I can say is that I jumped when someone rang a bell for service when I was in a little retail setting recently. After season two: the sound of the little desktop bell will make you VERY alert. I bought this set for the extras. I don't know that this show has what Icall repeatability. Time will tell. I'm so wrapped up in Season 3 currently that I haven't watched anything twice yet.<br /><br />My favorite movies of all time involve reluctant heroes. Bryan Cranston masterfully plays a dorky high school science teacher who never found his real potential. An underachiever who turns to the dark side when he is faced with mortality. So often in life we take the path of least resistance when forced to partner up in business, romance or gym class. The partnership of Jesse and Walt could not be more volatile and watching their interaction is often hilarious.<br /><br />I'm in Season 3 and finally caught up. The karma resonates as Walt's greed compounds. More characters are introduced; each of them affected negatively by the new player in town. Drugs ruin lives and take down a lot of the people connected to the users, dealers and manufacturers. Walt finds himself close to the edge with increasing frequency and when he acts out, it's a pleasure to watch.
0307266303|5.0|I have loved this book and it has opened running up to a whole new adventure!  I am very impressed w/the author and his research and experience.  If you love to run it is definatly worth reading!!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Bought it, knowing full well that there will be at least one more version coming out later.. I figure around Christmas.  Don't care.  For $24 and some change, I got the movie and it will be played to death on my Blu-Ray until the Special Edition comes out, which I will happily buy and then, oh yeah, play the color off of that as well.  Does it matter that someone is getting rich on all this..?  Hardly.  I hope Cameron is pocketing a ton of money.  Enough to convince him that he should go ahead and make at least one more.  When I think of all the other things I could be throwing my money away on, this little pittance, for the enjoyment it will buy me, is hardly worth mentioning.  The most important thing is that I now have MY OWN COPY of AVATAR!!!
B001FB55L2|5.0|Jake G. Toby M. & Natalie P. are amazing in this film! I love it.  The product came on time as well.<br />Imdb says: Before leaving on his second tour in Afghanistan, Marine Captain Sam Cahill, a leader, an athlete, a good husband and father, welcomes his screw-up brother Tommy home from prison. He'd robbed a bank. In country, Sam's helicopter is shot down and all are presumed dead. Back home, while Sam wastes away as a prisoner in a remote encampment, Tommy tries to take care of the widow and her two children. While imprisoned, Sam experiences horrors unbearable, so when he's rescued and returns home, he's silent, detached, without affect, and he's convinced his wife and brother have slept together. Demons of war possess him; what will silence them?
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen lately. Heartwarming and sometimes a little humorous.  Sandra Bullock and Quinton Aaron make a great but unusal team in this true story. Just a great movie!
6304602944|2.0|Tango & Cash is a movie about two cops (Stallone,Russell) that get framed, and get sent to prision for something they did not do. The interesting thing about Tango & Cash is that it is a comedy/action movie. There is good action in this movie but the comedy is not very good. Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell do a great job together. Stallone looks weird with his big glasses and banker suit, (the years of trying to branch out from Rocky & Rambo)    Jack Palance however, does a good job at playing the vilian role.  Overally Tango & Cash is an average movie and if you like action movies, you will enjoy this movie.
0393072231|4.0|An excellent read even for those who are not familiar with the financial markets.  However, I kind of felt Mr. Lewis could have investigated if  the root cause of the economic meltdown had the beginnings during the Regan administration's focus on deregulation and the betrayal of it's trust in a self-regulated market.

Comming off of the 5th Harry Potter film I was not sure how much life was in the Harry Potter Franchise,however, Harry Potter and the half blood prince definitly brings some more life and inticipation for the big two part ending!!  Any Harry Potter fan or fantasy film fan will enjoy this movie.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|This series was voted one of England's top comedies.  If you like to laugh, buy this.
1416550550|4.0|If you like a story with lots of twists and turns, that travels back and forth through the century with many multi-faceted characters, this is the one.  Just when you think you have it figured out, you don't!  The perfect book if you have a lot of down time on your hands, since it is extremely long.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman star in this 1994 drama   based on Stephen King's novel. A banker framed for murder  and a convict become friends at a New England prison.   This is one of my favorite films and Morgan and Tim   are terrific together. This special edition has nice   picture and sound plus neat extras. I definitely   recommend this.
0071636080|3.0|Here's who I think will want to read this book: you do presentations and are a big fan of Steve Jobs. If that's you, then just get the book.    Now if that's not you, it's probably the \\"big Steve Jobs fan\\" part and that's what gives me very mixed feelings about this book. The author is, apparently, a huge Steve Jobs fan, which is okay, but if Steve has any presentation `secrets' they're not in this book. I could find no information in the book that indicated that Steve had anything to do with the book, except lend his name to the title. Instead what this book contains is a good analysis of Steve's presentation style and what he does that makes Steve an extraordinary example of how to do specific kinds of presentations very, very successfully.    There's nothing wrong with that approach to the topic, but if you have read Scott Berkun's book (Confessions of a Public Speaker), then you don't need this one because Scott's book is better. Scott claims no `secrets,' but his book has a lot of practical advice and lots of little surprising tidbits you can use in any kind of presentation, not just the product introduction, marketing pitch or keynote speech. Gallo's focus is on those presentation types because that's mostly what Steve does. That means Gallo's book has much less to offer to all the rest of us who do conference-room presentations and, especially, technical presentations.     That said, Gallo's book is well researched and well written. He pulls in material from Garr Reynolds, Nancy Duarte and Dr. Medina (Brain Rules) among others. He provides an entertaining and interesting analysis of the factors that make Steve successful. Unfortunately, some of those factors are investing weeks in the preparation and using a many-person staff. Great advice, but my presentation is due three days from now and the staff is me.    If you read Gallo's book you will learn a lot about how Steve Jobs does it and you'll learn some useful things that apply to every presenter and everypresentation. But most of us will learn far more that we can apply by reading others, especially Garr's first book and Berkun's book.     Bottom line: on the plus side it's well written and entertaining, but there are better books out there if you are looking for pragmatic help doing the kinds of presentations most of us do.
B000286RKW|4.0|Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci star<br />in Martin Scorsese's 1990 crime drama based<br />on a true story. Henry Hill reflects becoming<br />a gangster and his life in the mob. This is<br />one of the best crime dramas with a great<br />cast and Joe is hilarious. This dvd set has<br />nice picture and sound plus some neat extras.<br />I recommend this.
B0030BYWKU|4.0|I would have given this CD a 5 star rating but only gave it a 4. The only reason I did not give it a 5 is because it only has 9 songs on it.  Every song is great with a catchy hook. I listen to it over and over. I especially love In My Head, What If, and Blinded.  But all are very good.  The CD would have been so much better if there were more songs. Jason reminds me of a combination of Chris Brown, Neyo and Usher. He is the whole package and wow can he dance too.  The price on Amazon through CD Imports is only $7.99, which is really a great price. I will look forward to Jason's next CD.
B0006J28KU|5.0|Al Pacino and Robert De Niro star in Michael Mann's 1995 crime drama.<br />A cop and a bank robber rival against each other. Al and Robert are<br />finally together since \\"The Godfather Part II\\" and this isn't only one<br />of their best films, but Michael's as well. This 2-disc special edition<br />has nice picture and sound plus neat extras. Get this great film.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|Wow!!!  What can I say but that this installment in the X-men franchise did not disappoint!!<br /><br />I did not read the comics growing up so I have no idea if they took dramatic license on wolverine's background but if the screen writer and director stuck with the comic book, it was great to know the back story of Wolverine.<br /><br />I had no idea he was soooooo old!!!!<br /><br />Anyway, talk about action packed!!!!  From the beginning of the film until the end, your attention is captured.  This flick had some character(s) I would have liked to have seen in the previous X-men movies.  Specifically, Gambit!  I know more than likely others would disagree but I wanted to know more about his background.<br /><br />Wow, I could go on and on and on about how great this movie is so I am going to end this review by saying that I highly recommend it!!!!

B0002KVULG|4.0|Frank Langella, Laurence Olivier, Kate Nelligan and Donald Pleasence  star in John Badham's 1979 horror remake. A seductive vampire bites  his way through London. Frank is amazing as Dracula and Laurence   was great as Van Helsing. John Williams also did great as always  with the music and this dvd has good picture and sound plus a   couple neat extras. I highly recommend this because it's one   of the best versions.
0385737424|5.0|This Newbery winner is the story of Miranda, a pre-teen living in late 1970's NYC. Over the course of several weeks her world is changed by new people and events which challenge her and make her look at the world and what is possible in different ways. I don't mean to be so vague, but giving any piece of the careful construction of this book away takes away from what a pleasure it is to read. Stead is right on the money with her protagonist and first-person writing style, this is really how a girl Miranda's age would think. There is also a very nice homage to A Wrinkle of Time throughout the book, along with a subtle but dense look at temporal physics that I was not expecting, but that added to the book's underlying themes of universality and connection. The mystery throughout the book is never belabored, and even if it does not come to an altogether satisfying conclusion it consistently keeps the story fresh and very fast-moving. This is a sophisticated, very well-written book for any reader, as it is simple enough for a young adult to enjoy but with deeper, more mature lessons about age and responsibility that would resonate with adults.
B000TGJ80S|4.0|Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, Keanu Reeves and Anthony   Hopkins star in Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 horror remake   based on Bram Stoker's book.

Get this good Dracula film.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|Five months after \\"Avatar\\" received its initial big-screen release, we are presented with its first release to the home-video market. Much has been written about the double and triple-dipping. We know this is a bare-bones release, devoid of ANY extras, special features, deleted scenes, commentary, etc. We know the studio is releasing a more complete edition of the film on Blu-ray in November 2010, and a 3D version at some point in the future. We've all heard the complaints from those who think this stripped-down version is merely a cash grab. So now Earth Day has arrived, and \\"Avatar\\" has been released in this bare-bones edition. For those who, like me, love the movie, and want to have something on-hand to enjoy until the more thorough release arrives in the months to come, is this worth it?    In a word, yes.    This Blu-ray is the movie only, with some basic search/bookmarking features and subtitles. There is no commentary, no trailers, no previews, no annoying advertisements that play before the movie starts. It's the movie only, much like the way DVDs presented films back in the early days of that format. You insert the disc (the disc loads and starts playing automatically in my Sony BDP-S570). There will be a moment or two of a blank screen as the disc loads. You'll see a brief message informing you to update your player's firmware if you experience any problems playing the disc. Then you'll see a piracy warning (thankfully it's brief), and then a basic Fox Home Video title screen. Now you come to a nicely animated menu screen, which gives you options to play the film, set up your options or search for a scene or bookmark.    The disc has an advanced feature which allows you to resume playback if you power your player off during the film playback. This option comes on automatically when you turn on the player again, even if you've removed the disc and reinserted it.    The video quality is astonishing, easily besting last month's Toy Story and Toy Story 2 releases from Disney. You have a full 16x9 (1.78:1) picture, which is how I remember the film being presented in RealD and Dolby 3D Digital in theatres. Colors are crisp and bright. No visible artifacts.    Audio is superb, a quite robust mix that will engage fully your 7.1 system.    This is the finest-looking Blu-ray of the year, thus far, and the best way to enjoy the film until the next more complete edition is released in November. Is this stripped-down edition a cash grab? I don't think so. I appreciate having a bare-bones release. It's refreshing to have a disc that is the movie only. Who needs all the junk that we get on most Blu-ray discs? Yes a making-of documentary would be fun, but is there anyone who loves the movie who doesn't already have some idea of the craft that went into making it?    This release is for people who love the movie, end of story. If you love the movie, you'll appreciate having such a wonderful, flawless transfer to enjoy in high definition at home. If you don't love the movie, you will find things to quibble about such as the lack of extras. I, for one, am happy with what we've got now.

6304698682|5.0|After a nine-year hiatus, Eastwood returns to the western genre in perhaps his most unusual western role. He plays a mysterious preacher who rides into town one day and decides to take on the local heavy, a wealthy but corrupt mine owner, and change the balance of power.<br /><br />The preacher is as deadly with an axe handle as with a gun, and there's a very martial-arts like stick fight between the preacher and four of the bad guys at the very beginning of the movie that was a unique touch. After soundly trouncing the townies when they attacked Michael Moriarty's character, Moriarty offers Eastwood a meal and a place to sleep in the tin panner's gold mining camp. After seeing the destruction wrought by the wealthy miner's men during a recent raid, he decides to throw his lot in with the tin panners who are losing the battle to resist the wealthy miner's attempts to drive them off their gold claim and take their land.<br /><br />The last fight scene between the hired \\"sheriff\\" and his deputies in the town is a classic. Eastwood isn't just a fast Old West style gunslinger; in his movies he often wins as much by cleverness and waiting for his opponent to make a mistake as by his blinding speed with a six gun.<br /><br />Eastwood is an underrated actor; he can communicate as much with a look and a glance from his stern visage in this movie as with any bit of dialog. And his recent Gran Torino showed that he really is a superb actor as well. I hope that movie wins best actor or director for Eastwood because it's certainly deserving of it.
0349113912|4.0|As usual, David Sedaris has assembled a hilarious collection of essays spanning his entire life, from the boisterous North Carolina childhood with his numerous sisters to his many (often slightly odd) jobs to his difficulties adjusting to life in France after moving abroad with his partner. Whether he's recalling his obsession with avoiding the usage of certain words in front of his fifth-grade speech therapist (dubbed a \\"secret agent\\" by his ten-year-old mind) or marveling at the difficulty faced by his adult French language classmates in explaining the meaning of Easter to a Muslim woman, Sedaris is guaranteed to make readers laugh, as well as ponder the oddities of the everyday world that most of us never really stop to think about.

B0000000KW|4.0|The real reason I bought this was because of the collaboration Ringo did with Jellyfish and (very little) Brian Wilson. For the bargain bin price I paid for a used CD, the purchase was well worth it. Nothing on here that you will ever hear on the radio, but it is right up my alley, and I do recommend it to any fan of The Beatles, Jellyfish, ELO, etc. I would rate it a solid B.
B000A1ENCU|5.0|Peter Ustinov is the ultimate Nero. His expressivity as an actor is extraordinary and his magnetic personality takes over the screen. I couldn't wait to see him again, even if his singing made me sick, when he was off and we side tracked to the romance which was always a bore because Deborah Kerr has the sex appeal of a side cabinet, although she is a good actress, I believe she must have been the most dressed, covered and modest woman in Rome at any period in the Empire, as a matter of fact she could have moved into a convent at the arrival of the Middle ages without batting an eyelid.    The best scenes in the movie are the huge public displays: The triumph for Marcus Vinicius (Robert Taylor) was stunning, even by today's standards and the view of Rome simply amazing and an extraordinary feat in a world without computers. The christians in the circus being thrown to the lions in the arena was equally compelling, it felt like being there, in a much more real way than the technical tricks of \\"Gladiator\\" for the circus scene, to give a more recent example. But nothing can match the famed fire of Rome. The streets burn form all sides engulfing a screeming, fleeing crowd in panic and it looks more like a documentary, particularly the scenes when the crowds escape through the sewers to the river.The role of Poppaea, Nero's cruel trophy wife was excellently done by Patricia Laffan whom we first see next to her pet cheetahs wearing an extraordinary hairdo and miles of fabric/trailing capes and remains throughout the movie an alter ego of Nero's perversity.She could have made a career playing corporate wives!    This is a movie you can own and enjoy watching over and over again so I suggest buying rather than renting
B000AOEMXM|5.0|As a fan of all things trek, I was impressed with the level of quality of this series.  This was the first Trek series I have watched solely on DVD... which meant my wife and I watched it in about 3 months.  After this we began watching the other series on DVD in order.  This seemed logical but there was one major problem.  The problem is ENTERPRISE starts out so much better then most of the other series.  It made me cry four times (3rd and 4th season)...and I don't cry.  I never had that kind of emotion with the other treks.    It is a show not unlike a lewis and clark  adventure.  Enterprise is by itself going where no man has gone before.  Making friends with some and enemies with more.     Each series grows as you watch it...charters get more depth, stories are written better and so on.  We peeled back our trek fan glasses and watched the original, TNG, deep space 9, and Voyageur.  All of them were weak their first and second seasons.  TNG frist show is a total joke next to Enterprise opener.  Enterprise was more together...more mature.  It seemed to start out as a second or third season show.      The 3rd and 4th seasons are Trek at it's best... right up at the top with other treks best and in some ways better.  The 3rd season is one giant arc... awesome.   Cool twists.  The 4th season has several mini arcs which lead to the federation and explain much of the back history of the later trek series and movies.      The characters are a strength and the actors who play them are very good.  Of my top 10 Trek characters 3 are on this show..  my top 10 in no particular order  kirk  spock  bones  archer  tucker  phox  data  worf  picard  sisko  And Tpol and Reed would make my top 15 along with Odo, Scott, and Quark    The shows only weakness is that it is tooo short...like the original.  Also,  Tpol's hair...  Her looks improve in later seasons as the wigs gets better.     Placing it on Friday night was a mistake... where shows go to die.  It really needed 1 or 2 moreseasons.  Paramount is so stupid.  They should had made it sindicated(sp?) like TNG.  Paramount needs to make another series and they need to understand that they have a huge fan base who will by their stuff.  It might not get ratings like other shows but 10 years after those other shows are off the air no will follow them.  Trek is a long term investment that makes money 40 years later.    Lastly,  Buy the series a season at time...like the other shows.  I understand that there are a lot of cheap Chinese copies of this show as well as the other series floating around out there.
078322947X|5.0|This is a movie about an oil rig blast like the one that just happened off coast of Louisiana. Intensely suspenseful film depicting ex-cons risking their lives delivering explosives via truck through an impossible terrain to stop the fire. Freaky s**t.    You must get the soundtrack by Tangerine Dream. Check out the theme, \\"Betrayal\\".     More on Tangerine Dream later.    See ya.

B0013FSL0C|5.0|As a clinical psychologist, I was pleasantly surprised to find Hollywood presenting an intriguing, more realistic world of psychotherapy than the typical ridiculous stereotypes.  The main character takes a psychodynamic perspective to therapy (I prefer cognitive-behavioral myself) and does so in a quick moving, confident fashion.  He is presented with numerous ethical dilemnas that he attempts to address in responsible fashions.  His clients are very interesting and realistic, as are the relationships between the therapist and clients.  I am looking forward to the second season!
B0035FQ1UU|1.0|Not sure what else to say except this move isn't worth watching even if it was free much less $14.99 to purchase or $3.99 to rent.

0375842209|5.0|Cannot be replicated anywhere....One of a kind novel.  By: John Machalek  Markus Zusak wrote The Book Thief in 2005. Zusak was born in 1975 and has written over thirty books, including I Am the Messenger, Getting the Girl and Fighting Ruben Wolfe. The story was based in Mulching, Germany, a small town that had no major part in World War One or World War Two, but was flattened by bombs by a misfire of enemy planes.        The Book Thief is a story told in the perspective of Death. He really is not the man the world perceives him as. He is not a white shiny skeleton covered in a black robe with a scythe. He is just a spirit and is around us all during our end on this world. Death was called to Germany during the holocaust. Death explains that his life is hard going from continent to continent, country to country, and city to city. He never gets a vacation and witnesses the death of all, bringing sadness upon him. He does not see emotion,he sees colors. Colors are how he communicates and is able to understand the strange lives of humans on Earth. Death sees many colors, but the one that interests him is a girl named Liesel.      Liesel is a young girl who is adopted by the Hubermanns. In actuality she was given by her mother to the Hubermanns for safety and health reasons. Liesel forms a quick relationship with Hans Hubermann, but is hesitant to form one with the reluctant Rosa Hubermann. Han's silver warm eyes show his good intentions. Rudy, Liesel's best friend, was not only a friend, but also a stealing companion, soccer enemy, and Jesse Owens. When Rudy was young he painted himself black with charcoal and ran around a track pretending to be Jesse Owens. Liesel would also meet max, the lonely Jew with nowhere to go. Max was a fighter with the biggest imagination possible. Maybe that is why Liesel was attracted to him. He would end up being Liesel's inspiration for writing The Book Thief. Liesel, of course, is the book thief. She does not only steal books from storeslike others. She steals books from anywhere, including burning buildings and even government houses.      The author wrote this book masterfully. The Book Thief captures the story of a young girl trapped in Nazi Germany. The book explains how Nazi Germany works and how the holocaust affected everyone. Whether it was Jews, Poles or Germans, they all had a hard time during World War Two. Retelling the story in the perspective of Death was genius. Death is neither for nor against any side, therefore he is neutral. The Book Thief teaches all readers more about the harsh life for the Germans inside of Germany. The book makes us all think, \\"why didn't anyone even see what Hitler was planning?\\" Now every Jew around the world is scarred. Even after World War Two there is still a Nazi party, making threats and gestures towards Jews every day. Overall, Zusak wrote a novel that any writer should be proud of.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Great series and great quality - the hype is real on this one.  I was even more impressed than I expected to be.  There isn't much to say that hasn't been said by now - if you are thinking about buying it just do it - it is worth every penny.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|The item arrived shortly after the order had been placed and was in superb condition. A good value from a good seller. It makes my kids very happy and me too.
B0038BZ9JU|5.0|Of course comparisons can be drawn, content-wise, to \\"Precious\\" and \\"An Education,\\" all released 2009, and I'm convinced that because of the successes of those two films this gem got somewhat lost in the shuffle.  \\"Fish Tank\\" deserves to be seen (won the BAFTA for Outstanding British Film, was nominated for the Palm D'or and won the Jury Prize at Cannes) and can fully stand on its own two feet--it is a great film with great performances and cinematography.  There are a couple reviews on here and more on IMDb.com that can do the film more justice than I can.  I would however like to take the opportunity to share my experience with the Blu-Ray version of this film.<br /><br />There is currently no Blu-ray version of \\"Fish Tank\\" available on amazon.com but I did find it available on amazon.co.uk.  The Blu-ray I received was the Artificial Eye release (011BD).  I have had good results with Artificial Eye in the past when I ordered an international version of \\"Hidden\\" (Cach&eacute;)--the difference though, \\"Hidden\\" was region-free, it had A, B & C on the case.  \\"Fish Tank\\" on the other hand is clearly region coded \\"B.\\"  I'll admit I was a bit worried about it working in my Blu-ray player, but I am excited to announce that it did indeed work (I am using a Panasonic DMP-BD55).  Movie played fine and looked great--curiously though in 4:3 (the old standard TV frame rather than the current 16:9 or any other cinematic aspect ratio) which is stated as the Director's Approved Ratio.  Special features on this version include: Andrea Arnold's Oscar winning short film \\"Wasp\\"; trailers for \\"Fish Tank\\" & \\"Red Road\\"; and a photo gallery of Holly Horner's stills from the set of \\"Fish Tank.\\"  Despite the film playing perfectly, a few of the special features did not.  Neither the trailers nor the short film played correctly--no image, I did hear the audio.  I have to attribute this to some sort of post-authoring.  It's safe to say that although this version of \\"Fish Tank\\" originated in the UK they didn't block its playability in other regions.  I am guessing that the short and the trailers were not authored to disc in the same way or from similar source materials that the film was, thus the standard PAL playback issues.  Sad.  After \\"Fish Tank\\" I was very curious to see more of Andrea Arnold's work, especially an early short--I will do some web-searching...  The photo gallery did work.  The final plus to this purchase was that I ended up paying £14.12 (under $22) which included shipping!<br /><br />Be adventurous and track down the films that you miss in the theater.n't block its playability in other regions.

B0002KQNJU|5.0|Once long ago my Granny Greene and I would stay up very, very late. I would stay with her sometimes when my parents wanted privacy.  At night on the week-ends, on local TV, they would have movie marathons and even \\"Shock Theater\\". We shared a love of horror films and watched them often. This movie,\\"The Fearless Vampire Killers\\", caught our attention and took us to a place that few movies go.We would eat fresh buttered pop-corn, candied apples, and real Philly Cheese-Steak sandwiches. Watching scary movies with the light out in my Granny Greene's old house was a real treat that I have never forgotten. Lots of movies pretend to have snow and ice, this one delivers. The classic vampire castle is marvelous and realistic. The costuming is a brilliant work of cinematic art. This was Roman Polanski in the beginning of his career, when he was in love with Sharon Tate. I don't know what he did to anger the Gods, but a curse was laid upon Polanski. Soon thereafter, Sharon Tate, while pregnant with Polanski's baby, was murdered by the Manson Family in their \\"Helter Skelter\\" rampage in the mid-60's. His life has been in ruin ever since. Somehow this curse involves Charles Manson, Sharon Tate, and Roman Polanski. He let loose an evil spirit, looked to closely into the dark, or perhaps he stepped on someone's grave. All people say \\"Beware the Polanski curse!\\" This is a very campy, dated and funny movie. I've looked for it for years. Finally it's in my possession! Special message for movie-buffs, [Please Note: This is the first time in a movie, where you see the vampire's ball. Lots of movies later try to re-create the vampire's ball, but the idea originated here with \\"The Fearless Vampire Killers.\\"] This movie is a must have for any ...creature of the night! P.S. Yes, it's true! There is a Gay Vampire in this movie. I guess that is also a first.

What makes the book special for me is, of course, Lisbeth Salander. Like what the Millineium Trilogy suggests, Salander is a new breed of victim/heroine for the 21st century.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|The collection has been clearly aimed at young women:  the packaging resembles the Barbie doll carrying cases vended in the mid 1960s and the colors and graphics hew closely to the pop images of that decade.

141654917X|2.0|I largely enjoyed reading the book (up to a certain point), although Anna seemed far too mature for her years and conversely many of the adults far too immature for theirs.     The part that really left me feeling disappointed was the ending. The author took the cheap and easy way out and  killed off Anna making her struggles seem pointless, her body nothing more than a ready source of spare parts. It seems the only value she had was to save her sister.    I would like to have seen how the family dealt with the death of the sister and how the family adjusted to the difficult changes her loss would have brought. The end was a litle too \\"Disney\\" for me, life is not like that and solutions are rarely so easily presented, because of that I would have a hard time recommending this book.

I originally ordered this Blu-ray from Netflix.  I immediately ordered it from Amazon because I knew this had to be part of my collection.    Stevie's voice was still strong.  His band was unbelievable.  The production was incredible.  The backup singers were sexy.  LOL.  Though I wish I could have some high quality performance video of Stevie from the 70s, I'm more than pleased with this performance.  They did it just right.  Also, he picked the right location to do this concert because real R and B isn't as appreciated here in The States anymore.      I'm gonna keep it short and say, this is a must have for the hardcore and not so hardcore Stevie fans, alike.

B0006ZE7G2|3.0|The Wall is a great album; the movie, Pink Floyd-The Wall is a striking, moving, frustrating muddle.  The images do not cohere in a unified narrative and at many points they overshadow the movie.  The images are superb; the music is superb, but together they add up to less than the sum of their parts.  This could all be explained away as a psychotic nightmare . . . fair enough, but art brings form to experience and clarifies it.  When art simply reflects experience, with all of its chaos and incoherence (if that is what is happening here), we have a classic case of what Yvor Winters called the 'imitative fallacy'.<br /><br />How do images of rape/asexuality/drug-induced catatonia/fascistic display/the brutality of war/the peaceful tending of field rats cohere?  They don't.  We get it that Roger Waters is psychically riven because of the loss of his father in WWII.  Why are the images here of the trench warfare of WWI?<br /><br />The overall effect of the film is one that suggests a loss of creative control (or a confusion of it).  The center (in my humble opinion) should be the music, but the music is often overshadowed by the imagery, the background sounds and the (excellent) acting of Geldof.  What should have been some of the titanic moments, e.g., Gilmour's soaring guitar solo at the end of Comfortably Numb, are lost amid the other sounds and visuals.<br /><br />This is a powerful film but, simultaneously, a great pity.  We do, however, still have the music, and better still we have the album for which (as some critics said at the time) The Wall was only a prelude: The Final Cut, Waters' masterpiece.

But even with holding back listening to this CD too much, I still find myself involuntarily singing, \\"The laaaaaast tiiiiiime you fallll on me for anything you like.\\"  I can't help it.  I love this music!     Not too long ago, I watched the movie, \\"He's Just Not that into You\\", and was pleased to hear one of Keane's songs, \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" playing in the background.  That's one of my favorite songs, only second to \\"Everybody Changes\\", which I can relate to.

B0006Z2KIY|1.0|** REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS **    This is a movie about infidelity.  It doesn't start out that way, but it does end that way.  When Allie Nelson (Rachel McAdams) and Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) start dating, they're both single at the time.  However, they soon break up and go their separate ways.  Allie gets engaged to be married to another man and Noah uses a woman as a sex toy while he grieves the loss of Allie.  When they later reconnect, instead of breaking up with their other partner's first, they cheat on them instead.      To help purify what they've done, both Allie's fiancé and Noah's sex toy quickly forgive them.  This is so we, the audience, can quickly forgive them, too, and just concentrate on how hot their romance is.  Who cares if it's at the expense of other people?    Well, I care.  It bothers me when infidelity is romanticized in movies, sending the message that cheating is okay just as long as you're really passionate about the person you're cheating with.  But it's not okay.  It's selfish and I saw this couple as selfish, too.    I saw Allie as a very callous and spoiled person.  For example, after promising her fiancé she's going to stay with him instead of Noah, the very next scene, she's back with Noah again.  When Noah acts surprised to see her back, she simply shrugs her shoulders...as if walking out on her loving fiancé is such a minor offense it deserves a simple shrug.    In an earlier scene where she first has sex with Noah, instead of feeling guilty for just cheating on her fiancé, she laughs and tells Noah she wants to have sex with him again.  Later, when her mother stops by and reminds her of her fiancé back home, she accuses her mother of being controlling.  While her mother was controlling, she was also right in setting her daughter straight...something Allie couldn't do herself because she was too self-absorbed.    But it wasn't just the romanticizing of infidelity that bothered me, it was also the romanticizing of a woman angrily hitting a man, too.   There are two scenes where Allie gets so mad at Noah she hits him and in one case, even slaps his face.  This is all portrayed as highly romantic because it signals just how passionate she feels about him.  But what if it was Noah who hit her?  Would that still be considered romantic?  It doesn't matter that a woman isn't as physically strong as a man, unless she's protecting herself from physical harm, a woman doesn't have a right to hit a man.    When a movie that promotes infidelity is heralded as the most romantic movie ever, it tells me that infidelity has become so mainstream that people can no longer recognize how spiritually corrupt it is.  Even the 1-star reviewers are mainly complaining that this movie that promotes infidelity doesn't match the book that promotes infidelity.  But what's the difference?  They're both stories that promote infidelity, so why isn't that considered the most offensive?

0618918248|5.0|When I first read this book, (soon after it was published in paperback), I found it to be a wonderfully written piece. Now not so much. I've been thinning my bookshelves of late and had time to look through the book's pages that I'd read years ago. While I still agree with the author as to his opinions on the god of the Hebrew and Christian bibles - hereafter &#34;THE bible&#34;, I think this book should go through another edition to eliminate the overly rhetorical nature of the subject matter and stress the science rather than the polemic nature of Dawkins' arguments. That he wrote a sequel to this book, is of course NOT brought up in the many reviews that have been posted over the years. The sequel, &#34;The Greatest Show on Earth&#34; was much better at defining the matter of providing Dawkins' scientific proof he alluded to in this volume. The God Delusion has served its purpose as a launching pad for his later work and it did so well enough. Now, however, the book is old as books in paperback often get. The pages have yellowed, the binding is old and the spine cracks a little when I flex the book to leaf through the well-read pages. So, what shall I say about this book that has any meaningful substance? Here goes: The book is polemic in nature. Dawkins vents his spleen and says a lot about his opinions, often in colloquial speech - at the ridiculous nature of god(s) and belief therein but he needed a second book to expand his first and that was a shame as much of the second volume could have been fitted in the first with a little careful editing.  I can no longer recommend this book as I think going straight to the sequel is a better option since doing so would be a better value for the money and a better read than buying the first just to read what Dawkins has to say as he vents at the silly nature of religion and belief in deities or deity invisible.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|DARK CITY is a rare gem and the director's cut elevates it from great to sublime. It precedes the similarly themed MATRIX by a few months and both were overshadowed by TITANIC, so DARK CITY has been unjustly overlooked. I'm glad that Roger Ebert has championed the film and it has developed a following in the last ten years.<br /><br />The video quality is very good. There is some softness occasionally but this rendering is superior to any that have preceded it. I am very pleased with the beautiful transfer and enjoyed noticing several details I had missed on DVD or in the theater. An Edward Hopper painting in motion. Some SFX have been improved for the director's cut. Audio quality is also excellent.<br /><br />This BD has a nice selection of extras though I couldn't play the \\"Director's Cut Fact Track\\" along with audio commentary. This is another barebones disc, without a booklet or scene guide, that deserved some special attention.<br /><br />DARK CITY has my highest recommendation for everyone and this BD is the best way to watch it.
B001BMXFX0|5.0|Alice Sebold is an author full of imaginative, gruesome, and intriguing stories. Her story of the rape and murder of Susie Salmon in The Lovely Bones is unforgettable and a must-read. Despite the stomach-wrenchingly detailed first chapter, the story is filled with themes ranging from love, death, friendship, and betrayal. Sebold's creation of a foreign world is so distant yet realistic enough that one could find themselves daydreaming in such a place.      As Susie's family trucks through the pains and hardships of a lost daughter and sister, they find more about each other every day. For example Mrs. Salmon, though a loving mother, ends up cheating on her husband with the lead detective of her daughter's case. She then leaves her husband and flees the state. Her realization of the person she truly is leads her to find her own mistakes in settling down and having three children. One comes to dislike the mother but this hate seems to be what Sebold intends for the reader.     The continued description of each character throughout the book makes each character more relatable. In contrast to previous reviews, I saw that the ever-changing story line made the tale a page-turner. The so-called slow middle was essential to the feel and flavor of the story. Without all the background information and minor details given in this portion of the book, the plot would have been thrown off.     As far as writing style, Sebold's got it down. The book was simple in terms of language but complex in its themes and ideas. The plot was realistic enough that at times the reader could feel scared in the sense that things like this do happen, and there are people out there like George Harvey, Susie Salmon's killer.     It could be the purpose of this story to warn readers of those not always apparent dangers. However, when put in a delicate and fantasy-like manner, the story becomes much more gentle and tangible. At times one could feel as if they were a part of the story themselves. As for a recommendation to read this book, it should be on everyone's reading list.
B003A060K6|2.0|To be blunt, I'm disappointed with this record. Andorra really showed how unique Caribou was. That record gave me the sense that there wasn't anyone who could match the magical area that Dan Snaith occupied. However, almost all of Swim falls flat to me. It's almost like Dan was hanging out too much with Kieran Hebdan (Fourtet). In fact, Swim sounds like the tracks that didn't make the cut for Kieran's exceptional new Fourtet record. While there are a couple bright spots (I love the track \\"sun\\"), the rest of Swim sounds like someone just experimenting with mediocre house music and overlayering them with aimless samples that don't add anything.  Maybe I hold Caribou to unattainable standards, and maybe Swim will grow on me, but so far no I'm not impressed.

'Year One', 'The Dark Knight Returns', 'The Long Halloween', 'Dark Victory', 'The Killing Joke', 'Arkham Asylum', and on and on.  Batman has been my favorite for years, which makes it a little strange to say that Mark Millar's 'Superman: Red Son' is my favorite graphic novel of all time.    It's always tough to jump into a superhero's mythology so many decades after its beginning.  In that respect, 'Red Son' is perfect for the Supes newcomer; it's a complete story, with a beginning, a middle, and an end.  No multiple backstories to read up on, no origin story to research.    The premise is simple: instead of crash-landing in Smallville, Kal-El's spaceship ends up on a collective farm in the Soviet Union.  We get to see what might've happened if Superman's origin story had gone this way.    To be clear, this Elseworlds story isn't a butterfly effect-type tale.  Millar doesn't simply change the location of Kal-El's crash and then write about how this change alone effects the Superman universe.  Many DC characters pop up with altered roles and origins, including the Green Lantern, Batman, Wonder Woman, Lex Luthor, Bizarro and more.    Therein lies my favorite part of 'Red Son'.  These characters are not brought in just for recognition purposes; they all have a reason for being there, and all of these reasons are heavily influenced by Superman being a communist instead of an American.  I read and re-read Batman's part all the time, not because it's Batman, but because it's a truly amazing scene.    Props must be given to Millar for such tight and all-encompassing storytelling.  He's written a tale that gives us a glimpse of what might happen if the most powerful American superhero of all time wasn't American at all.  Even for fiction, it's a little frightening.  And the ending is absolutely mind-blowing; you must read it to believe it.    Dave Johnson and Kilian Plunkett's art is spot-on, and it's only helped by this definitive hardcover edition.  The cover (as you can see above) is a beautiful piece of faux-propaganda, and it fits the tone of this graphic novel absolutely perfectly.    If you're looking for a fascinating, high-quality story that doesn't require a great deal of past superhero knowledge or research to enjoy and understand, then 'Superman: Red Son' should be a no-brainer, and this new deluxe edition should only seal the deal.
B00009Z576|4.0|Drama is one of Yes' most underrated albums. The absence of Rick Wakeman and Jon Anderson (in particular) would seem too much to overcome, but keyboardist Geoff Downes and vocalist Trevor Horn (both formerly of The Buggles) fill the vacancies surprisingly well considering they came from New Wave and not Prog. Downes displays great facility and imagination on keyboards and Horn (while an annoyingly affected singer at times) sings with conviction. Given the mixed pedigree, this album sounds every bit the transition between the Yes of old and the Top 40 Yes (and Asia) that would come a few years later.     What's great about this album is how Steve Howe, Alan White and Chris Squire's virtuosity is brought into tighter focus to serve what is ostensibly radio-friendly material. Their instrumental chops are on full display, but rarely feel indulgent.     The album's strongest material -- \\"Tempus Fugit,\\" \\"Into the Lens,\\" \\"Run Through the Light\\" and \\"Does It Really Happen?\\" -- deliver prog virtuosity with new wave style.  However, the album's weak spots (the overblown \\"Machine Messiah\\" and under-developed \\"White Car\\") keep it from earning a higher rating.     Nonetheless, I'd take this album over its lackluster predecessor Tormato any day.
B0031N2NFS|5.0|If you liked Trials of Van Occupanther, this is more of the same goosebumpy vocal stuff.  If you're like me, you'll be having a fine time embarrassing yourself trying to sing along with the harmonies.
B001UV4XUQ|4.0|I liked this movie alot. It is far different than any boy meets girl romantic comedy you have seen in the past. Though my wife usually has to tie me down to watch those movies with her, I watched 500 Days of Summer on my own free will... and then I bought it.   The off-beat, sometimes dry humor is what I found appealing. That, and solid delivery by the main cast makes this (if not owning) worth watching.
B00368Q3UY|5.0|Amazing portability which is very important to me when traveling abroad.  No need to carry extra batteries, no need to carry extra speaker.  To charge it I am using Apple USB power adapter/110V-240V/ which works also great with my   SanDisk Sansa Mp3 player.  Works great for me to learn languages without headphones at home or in my car.  SD card or mini SD is very useful to copy various languages or different type of music for quick change.   Headphones, SD card and all cables that you may need are also included.  Works perfect with car audio if youur car stereo is Mp3 capable.  Outstanding sound for this size of speaker.  So far this mini Mp3 player/speaker is the best I have encountered.  The sound clarity is beautiful.The highs clear/ tested Kate Bush- Wuthering Hights/,  lows are not boomy, the bass is realistic with the speaker fully open.  Just fell in love with this toy,but not for so long, because my son \\"borrowed\\"   it forever.Looks like that I have to buy another one.  Before I have been traveling with iMainGo2 portable speaker/very,very, good/,but  this little wonder has it all what you need by yoyr bed in your hotel,  barbecue, beach or on the table when you have your lunch or dinner.  Many hours of playback with 3.5 hrs battery charging time.  Amazing portability,aesthetic quality, good sound of this product has impressed  me.  Can reccomand to anyone who wants to have quality music on the go            .

0307266303|5.0|Born to run has become a bible to me. I run diffenrently than I did before, my motivation is based on different values than before, my shoes are different than before and I have learned a great deal about the human body. And most of all: Why do we run. A very inspiring book, easy to read because the sheer facts are bombined in inspiring cases, stories and you can't wait to find out who wins the greatest race on earth...
B0018RVJWM|5.0|This is a must read! fascinating look at life and religion. It is rare that I find a book that I want to re-read. This is one of the few.
0307454541|3.0|With over 1000 reviews I'm sure most people have an idea of what the book is about.  It's a mystery with a whole bunch of different mysteries wrapped up in it.  What begins as an investigation 30 years later of a missing (presumed dead) girl turns into a whole lot more.  I don't know how I feel about this book.  Overall I liked the book.  I did not understand what was happening in the beginning.  I did not like that after 200 pages I wasn't sure why I was still reading the book.  Then, I guess the story took over and I wanted to know what would happen.  My favorite character was Lisbeth Salander and it was her story that kept me reading mainly because I wanted to see if she made it through the book or not.  I will read the next book.
B0035WTE2U|3.0|Am I a hardcore AC DC fan? Not really but I still like and own most of their albums and find them to a highly enjoyable band and consider them one of the true classic bands. The thing with AC DC is that they made timeless music and each album brings up a few hits and therefore more classics, that's how it's been for quite some time. However no real greatest hits package have ever been released to this day, in fact I don't really consider this soundtrack to the Iron Man 2 movie or even the soundtrack from the \\"Maximum Overdrive\\" movie \\"Who Made Who\\" of 1986 a best of package, they don't cover enough of the band's music. I know that those are just soundtracks and they release songs that were played in the movie but I feel that the band would need a proper greatest hits just for the sake of it and because almost every other band has one or more. I think a 2 disc album (perhaps even 3 discs?) covering the band from beginning would be appropriate and would truly honor the band's legacy, plus I think casual fans who are not really big fans (and there are many!) would definitely want to get it.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 has 3 songs from their best-selling album, 1980's \\"Back In Black\\" (which is often pointed out as the best album made by the band), 2 from \\"Highway To Hell\\"(1979), \\"Let There Be Rock\\"(1977) and \\"The Razor's Edge\\" (1990) , 1 from \\"T.N.T\\"(1975), \\"Powerage\\"(1978), \\"For Those About to Rock\\" (1981), \\"Flick the Switch\\"(1983),\\"Black Ice\\"(2008) and \\"Backtracks\\" (2009) each. Totalling 15 songs from different eras and albums, this soundtrack gives you a fair review of the band and has a pretty solid selection of songs. The soundtrack has certainly many classic songs but it misses others such as \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", \\"It's A Long Way To The Top(if you wanna rock'n'roll) and more recently \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\" and \\"Rock'N'Roll Train\\". Point is there are many great songs that are not included here, perhaps it's because it's a soundtrack but it doesn't change the fact that it's a good enough compilation, I say this and I feel fans will agree with me, if there should be an AC DC compilation it should at least be done properly.<br /><br />The DVD has the video of the Iron Man 2 \\"Shoot to Thrill\\" version it's making of and 7 other live performances of the band over the years. It's a not a bad DVD, it could have been better but at this price there really isn't any reason to complain. The deluxe edition of the soundtrack has a reprinted Iron Man #1 comic book with an AC DC cover, a big hardcover booklet with liner notes and stickers. For the hardcore fan I don't feel like there is much as I thought there would be more, I'd just stick with the regular version of Iron Man 2 but that's just my opinion.<br /><br />I say this is a small taste of the band if you really want the best you have to buy the albums as no greatest hits album quite covers the band as best as possible. Seeing how there are no real AC DC compilation out there this is better than nothing and it does give you a few of the best and classic songs. The DVD is a great addition and it does make this soundtrack/greatest hits package a better value. One thing I command AC DC: Iron Man 2 for is the half-half balance between the Bon Scott era of the band and the Brian Johnson one, I think it brings out good things out of both world and is a fair compilation. I give it 3 stars because of the CD/DVD combo, the even representation of both eras of the band, and a not perfect but good selection of songs.a good enough compilation, I say this and I feel fans will agree with me, if there should be an AC DC compilation it should at least be done properly.

B00275EGWY|1.0|HARDLY worth the acclaim it has received.  The way the camera films this movie will give you a headache.  The story is lame, the acting is adequate at best, and how many times do you have to watch a bomb being diffused?  Another political award that is non-deserving.  Don't waste your time, and surely don't waste your money.
630516889X|5.0|I saw this movie a while ago and I still love it and is the best predator movie. The movie is about a group of soliders that go into a jungle to save some captives from a terriorst group or something.After that they are stalked by a mysterious killer that is killing them all.At the end Dutch (Schwarzenegger)is left to kill it. This is a great action movie and has a good story and an interesting villian.Bottom line another good action movie.
B0034KHFM4|5.0|I remember getting Lady Gaga's The Fame sometime last year, and I thought I made a really good purchase. She's so damn good. I really got into Poker Face and a couple others, and when she announced that a 2nd album was coming out, I couldn't wait. I had no way of getting Bad Romance when it first came (if I had Amazon before then I probably would've had Bad Romance already) When I first the music video I was utterly amazed by the whole thing. And not too long ago Telephone finally came out. And boy was THAT a treasure. I go to her site now and then just to watch the Telephone mini movie/music video. And now with Alejandro out I can't wait to see that music video. Oh, and I do agree with a lot of people that the explicit version is finally out. I bought the The Fame Monster and it was good, but after hearing the word \\"bitch\\" so many times in Bad Romance I thought it sounded off with \\"bit\\" so I went ahead and got the single of Bad Romance. Surprisingly I don't mind Dance In The Dark being edited but I do agree that explicit is better (maybe not to a lot of people)    I'm so stoked on what Lady Gaga will release next (single and album wise) The woman is AMAZING!!!
B0006Z2LP6|5.0|This is my favorite movie and I needed to upgrade to DVD. I couldn't be more pleased.
0439023483|5.0|What a gripping story of what life could be like in the future!  After reading and loving this book, I played the book on CD while our family went on a road trip.  My children all loved it, even the 3 teenagers who usually feel \\"too old\\" to listen to a family book.  It's an amazing story, with an admirable heroine.  We can't wait to see who she ends up with in the 3rd book!
B0030Y11XS|3.0|I have a rather love/hate relationship with Michael Moore and the film's that he produces.  Sometimes they are informational, engaging and full of moments that make then worthy of being watched such as \\"bowling for columbine.\\"    But once in awhile he puts out a film that just does not make that much sense, and unfortunately \\"Capitalism: A Love Story\\" is one such film.  Filled more with deprecated one-way political viewers, and a distinct underlying hatred for most of the content observed the film is more or less a chore to watch.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is the best movie.  My whole family loved it.  We have watches it three times already.  I know that we will enjoy it for a long time to come!!  I would recommend this movie to everyone!!
B002T921AC|3.0|I can write a review for this because it went to my Granddaughter who loves it...
B001UREJWM|5.0|Given that the two tracks the guys wrote for the live Radio City Music Theater album were boring, I didn't have high expectations for this album. I now feel ashamed for underestimating my heroes. This album is fantastic from start to finish. Iommi's tone is awesome and Dio still sounds great (scratchier and a smaller range, but still great). Geezer's bass lines are fantastic; check out his playing on Rock & Roll Angel. Other reviewers suggest this album has a \\"plodding\\" tempo and is boring overall; this is wrong. The tempo is perfect and gives each song great space. Bible Black is transcendental and has Iommi's greatest riff in almost 20 years; that songs is worth the price of the album alone. I listened to this album on repeat for at least three months after I got it and I'm still not tired of it. There is something about how the end of \\"breaking into heaven\\" trails into the beginning of \\"atom and evil\\" that makes this a great album to listen to on repeat. If this were the last album Sabbath ever made, it would be a proud end to the band's journey.

B000066C6Z|4.0|Good, fun spoof of WWII films, and cold war spy thrillers.<br /><br /> Just - for me at least - not quite up to the lunatic genius level of<br />`Airplane!' (which was created by the same team), with more dull patches,<br /> or jokes that don't quite work. But where it's funny, it's very funny. Certainly<br /> worth a look if you've never seen it.
0321543726|3.0|received in good time and condition. bought this book for class. it is very clear in explaining concepts and grammar.
B00005T5YK|5.0|This is one of the best dvd audio discs available, the voice is crystal clear and the guitar is very clean, also the drums, it has enough mid-bass in the 5 channels and not only on the sub-w channel. The price is super high but... they're not going to do more. By the way, if you have an Acura, the guy (Elliot Scheiner) who mixed this album is the same guy who designed the sound system (ELS stands for his name) in your car, so it sounds flawless.
0439023491|4.0|I loved The Hunger Games but I wasn't at all sure that the concept could past the first book. Catching Fire was the rare sequel that is just as good as the original. It was an edge of your seat, can't put it down thriller. Although at first glance it might seem like the plot is a rehash as the main characters return for an All Stars rematch game, the characters all stepped out of their expected roles, surprising me. The world-building continues and it was satisfying to see many more aspects of the culture and politics, many more regions of the country and to begin to see how the economy and government work.<br /><br />Most of all though are all the complex issues that this series takes on: The role of the media in public and private life. The dangers of a totalitarian government that controls and manipulates the media and that uses the media to control the masses, reality television, privacy issues. The ways in which living in a totalitarian regime not only<br />destroys public freedom but even removes the ability of people to live out their most intimate lives, the way it destroys peoples ability to be free even to love who they wish.
B000H3096A|5.0|Bouquet is gorgeous. Perhaps it has been choreographed by Alvin Ailey. If not, it should be. Another favorite is When You Are Near. I have written words for it, and should send them to Bobby Hutcherson. He has so many compositions, that he may not even think of that one. I remember hearing him on an NPR interview back when I was in undergraduate school. It was so beautiful when he spoke about his mother, and how she inspired his playing: that she was ill, and and his playing soothed her. He has certainly inspired me all these years. Even his acting in Round Midnight is commendable.
B00002N9ER|4.0|These were a replacement for a set I had bought years ago and one had broken.    I really like these brackets as they allow me to keep my Mag lite flashlight in a conspicuous spot and allow easy removal when needed.    My only concern is that they do break after a couple of years.  I'd like to see a softer more flexible plastic used in their construction, thus ensuring a longer lasting product.    Of course with the reasonable price I feel they are still a good buy.
B000008JUM|5.0|Every time I play this CD I marvel at the uniqueness all over again. Anyone that comes over and hears it wants it. Awesome, just listen and you'll be a fan.
0446563048|3.0|This book traces Tony Hsieh's rapid progress in the business world, from callow party dweeb with a high IQ to his selling of Zappos to Amazon for north of a billion dollars.  Along the way, we get some ups and downs in business startups, the hunt for money, the hunt for the secret to corporate long-term success, and some input from partners and employees along the way.  Zappos' leadership eventually decided to emphasise sterling customer service as the key to their own corporate culture, and the last third of the book - the part worth reading - covers what this means to the customer, to the employees tasked with turning it into a reality, and to the bottom line.  The idea was to infuse ten larger values (with numerous sub-meanings and applications) into every aspect of every department of the company.  Since Hsieh is now a billionaire or very close to it, one can say that, certainly in this case, it worked.      In general the book is a very light read.  It is destined to be given out to employees for free, and to serve as a sort of corporate diary and the documentation of the corporate mythology.  That's not necessarily bad, just what it is.  The last few pages are a little more thoughtful, where the author tries to relate his business experience to a philosophical discussion of life, the universe and everything.  This stuff might be a bit of a stretch, but it is the kind of expansive view of things one can expect from a businessman in his position and there are few business books by hugely successful authors that can resist this kind of thing.
0810993139|5.0|This book is very funny and shows the everyday life of a boy who gets into the same situations little boys and girls get into.  Characters go from silly, to rude, to sweet, just like the real world.  I know it has a lot of bad reviews saying that it teaches bad manners and bullying and things like that, but I tell those same people: Do you even remember when you were in elementary or middle school?  Your kids live those same situations everyday, they don't learn it from a book, they live it.  Besides, kids learn what you teach them at home.  My daughter is 8 and read 3 books from the series already, she knows when the things in the book are right, wrong or plain silly, she actually tells me so.  Books are not parents, we are, and as long as we talk to our kids and discuss the why/how/when with them, they'll learn to recognize it.  That's how we teach them morals, not by shielding them from eveything that's not ideal or perfect.  This book shows a kid that behaves like a kid, and that's learning throught life.  Yes, the kids in this book lie, cheat and bully, but they also make friends, love and learn.  They fall and they stand back up, and it's all shown with a great sense of humor that appeals to both young and older readers.  I would definitely recommend it!

Habla de las aventuras de un ni&ntilde;o extraterrestre que vive en un peque&ntilde;o planeta y viaja a otros planetas en busca de amistad y de las respuestas de la vida. Es suficientemente simple para ni&ntilde;os, pero suficientemente entrtenido para los adultos.
0307454541|4.0|My only really complaint is that Larsson sometimes went into detail about certain things that had no real value to the story. I'm all for vivid description, but it has to be done in the right dosages with the right subject matter. This book has a wonderful collection of characters and the author does a terrific job with the dialogue which comes across very natural. The story is well-written and the mystery plot is a page turner. I will be buying the next book in the series.
0307269752|3.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was certainly a page turner with some surprising twists that was made more interesting by its setting.  It was not, however, particularly well written or conceived.  The plot rested on some very unlikely premises and contained dialogue that was far from realistic.  So if you are looking for a carefully crafted novel, this is not for you.  If you are looking for a good, quick read (or 3, given this is the first in a trilogy), this would be a good selection.
0316044407|3.0|Just not my cup of tea. I suppose it is well enough written, but it did not grab me. Certainly it may appeal to others, but the premise seems too fanciful for my taste.

0446560065|5.0|I first saw one of the videos on Youtube and became instantly hooked. It shows all of the funny little things that cats do all the time. He perfectly captures them and makes them into these cartoons. They are very funny and down to Earth.  Every cat owner sees these cartoons and relates to the situations. If you have ever owned a cat, you need to watch the videos and should buy this book. I have recommended it to all of my family and friends and highly recommend it to you. I cannot wait for the next one. I will definitely buy it.
B000KITQK2|4.0|I have a 40-year-old Epiphone Texan acoustic guitar that has a great sound -- until I use the old piezo pickup, which always ends up sounding tinny and thin without a pre-amp. The choice is an expensive active pickup with a clean pre-amp, or something with analog emulation that also serves as a DI box. For under $30, the ADI121 is tough to beat. It emulates a tube-driven microphone, so it has a smooth analog sound versus a pristine (and unforgiving) digital sound. It made a huge difference when I play solo, removing the harsh piezo sounds.    Bottom line: This gives you an active pre-amp that significantly improves the sound of piezo pickups, and still gives you the XLR out to plug directly into your board.    For the money, it's tough to beat.
B002XMGGJM|5.0|What can we say Butler, Foxx 2 awesome actors going head to head!  This movie puts a good spin on how messed up our justice system is.  On a side note i believe in the end foxx should of been put away for what he did, if he was a true servant of the justice system.  But no it goes to show you that he is just as corrupt as he was in the beginning.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|DVD shipped in good time and came in great quality!!! Nothing bad to say at all. The only problem I have is my four year old wants to watch it ten times a day now!!!!

0446560065|5.0|I have grown up with cats; my parents have owned AT LEAST one cat at a time since before I was born, and I am in my twenties.<br /><br />This book is the most hilarious depiction of cats' manerisms, and almost ever picture I saw reminded me of one of my cats.  I love it, my best friend loves it, and even her mom cracked up while leafing through it.<br /><br />It is a really thick book, but since there are no words to read, the entire book can be leafed through in a single not-too-long sitting.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who owns, or has owned, a cat.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|DON'T BUY THIS VERSION.. Why do I want a Blu ray/DVD combo? I have blu ray players in my house, why do I need a DVD version? I does not make sence... This is one of the best movies of all time.. this is like the versions with the back up download... it is really stupid... Like the other reviewers, wait for a better version with special features... ONE STAR RATINGS is only for this version of the product, not the movie... the movie is 5 stars....
B00337KM2S|4.0|This movie is essentially making the point for family and marriage versus being single and career driven. It is about the sad solitude for someone who has no roots, someone who travels 300 days a year and has no one to come home to. Naturally, the inevitable conclusion and the lesson the main character (Clooney) learns at the end is that none of the success and mileage accumulating (the big goal is to make it into the 10 million mile club for the heck of it) mean anything, if you dont have anyone to share it with, if you dont have anyone to come home to. In this case, we find out that he is actually in an even worse shape than the people he fires, because they all have someone to go home to, someone who will help them get through it, while Clooney's character - despite all the material privileges and looks - doesnt.     The lesson here then is to try to do everything you can to not be alone, which  - according to this movie - is worth than death.     The movie is entertaining and i must say I appreciated the independent feel of it. It wasnt all fake and glammed up and except for Clooney and Farmiga, none of the actors looked like they had jumped out of some   photoshopped Vogue pages. They were real people (which somehow made Clooney be out of place...but that's another story) who felt and looked real. Overall pretty entertaining and fun - if you are not completely and utterly alone.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This has been a wonderful DVD for me.  It was SO difficult when I first started.  (I couldn't even make it completely through set 1).  But I kept at it and now I can complete Level 1 just fine all the way through.  I can see and feel a difference this has made in my body.    This is the best DVD I have ever purchased for exercise purposes.  I love how it's set up with the 3 different levels and even within those levels you'll find an advanced and beginner option.  I'm moving on to level 2 next time.  :)      I like how Jillian talks you through it all and makes you feel like you CAN do this.  Don't give up on yourself.  I couldn't complete level 1 when I started, but I can now, and I'm confident I can go further.      Great for building stamina, lean muscle, and confidence.  I average a loss of 1 pound each week right now.  I'm sure if I did actually use the DVD each day, I would lose more.  (I use it about once every 1 to 2 weeks).    Good luck to you all.  I promise you this is going to help you reach your goals.

B002UNMW7O|2.0|In the documentary 'Overnight,' fans of 'The Boondock Saints' were shown how writer/director Troy Duffy truly was: an abrasive, insulting jerk with little respect for anyone or anything. Because of his behaviour, he alienated himself with the Weinstein brothers and, even though he was supposed to be the \\"next big thing,\\" he basically destroyed his chance at Hollywood success and fans lost their chance at a sequel to one of the best action flicks of our time. Nine years later, however, the much-awaited sequel was finally given to loyal fans.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it was a total mess.<br /><br />The story starts when a Boston priest's murder is staged to look like the work of the Saints. As expected, the Saints come out of retirement from their sanctuary in Ireland and, with the help of a new friend, head back to Beantown to set the record straight. Meeting with a couple of old acquaintances and making some new ones along the way, the Saints hunt down their copycat and fight some new members of the Yakavetta mafia (including Breakfast Club's Judd Nelson, hilariously enough).<br /><br />What Troy Duffy was thinking as he was making this movie is just beyond me. This sequel seems like a way of slapping the faces of all the fans that have been begging him for a new movie for the past nine years. After seeing his personality in 'Overnight,' it wouldn't be a surprise if this was his actual goal. Just about every single technical element is rotten from the inside out. The first most noticeable fault is the tremendously bad acting. Other than the Saints, just about everyone delivers irritating and hammy performances throughout (even the bigger name actors like Julie Benz from 'Dexter'). The characters' dialogue doesn't help matters much as it seems like Duffy came up with a few random jokes and tried to build the entire script around them instead of just letting the humour flow nicely like he did with the first film's script. Random slapstick is tossed in that is more embarrassing than funny. There was simply just too much humour . Duffy's direction is stale and unimpressive which makes it obvious his long absence from the director's chair was hugely damaging to his talent. What makes all of these elements worse is the fact that there's not enough great Saints action to make up for them. In the first, there were a few minour acting and writing issues and such, but no one could possibly care because the action and direction were so fantastic. Unfortunately, there isn't much here to make the negative elements worth it.<br /><br />Overall, I guess the best thing about this film is that it makes the original that much better by comparison.<br /><br />Final Verdict: 4/10, generous and only for the Saints.<br /><br />-AP3-barrassing than funny.

B000002AGE|5.0|Remember when \\"heavy\\" was common slang used for \\"fantastic\\" or \\"hip\\"?<br />This album is it...<br /><br />As a self-proclaimed prog head coming out of the 70's and appreciating more of the jazz sound in music, fusion groups like Weather Report were a natural fit for me when I discovered this album during the early 80's.  (Hey, it was either fusion or groups like Wham!  -  I made the right decision...  ;-)  \\"Heavy Weather\\" made enough use of synthesizers to soothe my prog yearnings, while I reveled in the jazzy excursions on which these masters took me.  Just fantastic songwriting from all members of the band, and clever execution as true virtuosos on their respective instruments.  My only regret is that it entertains us for a mere 38 minutes!<br /><br />For a bass lover like myself, of course I was additionally drawn to the unique and jaw-dropping craftsmanship displayed by Mr. Pastorius.  With the exception of some of his work with Joni Mitchell, this may have been his best stuff.<br /><br />Others here have already lavished suitable praise in critique of this album.  I wish only to add my voice to the throng  -  not just because this was a great album, or because it was the first album I ever purchased on cd (yes, I remember the moment!);  but since this is the last review that I foresee ever writing here (it is my 150th  -  other shtuff to get to, ya know?...), and I wanted this last review to be of a special cd in my collection.<br /><br />This album is it.  It's heavy, man.<br /><br />I value interesting music that is played and recorded well.  This cd's rating was based on:<br />Music quality = 9.1/10;  Performance = 9.5/10;  Production = 9/10;  CD length = 7/10.<br />Overall score weighted on my proprietary scale = 9.0  (\\"4-1/2 stars\\")

0060527986|4.0|This is one of those little tomes that you can open to any page and find inspiration, if not direction...sort of like the I Ching, though not quite as dense.  It took me awhile to get an English version, having first unconsciously ordered it in Portugeuse.  Now having \\"read\\" it and \\"studied\\" it some, I find it necessary to return to it again, as this is one of those books that can be read  and reflected upon many many times as we come out of the darkness that, I think, many of us have been living in for oh so long.  I can see this little book, if read with intent, contributing to some upheaval in the life of the reader.  Not that there is a dark side to this book...one would do well to remember that Mr. Coehlo is, among other things, an adept magician; and, in my opinion, the process of coming into one's own is likely to be, especially when aided by the \\"magic\\"(energy) of this book, accelerated.  So, if movement is on your agenda, be prepared.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|What's not to love? Snow White, digitally remastered on blu ray. What else can be said. OK. More can be said. There's a bunch of extras too. And a copy of the movie on DVD.<br /><br />I sat down and watched this with the kids. There was the unfortunate interminable set of previews that all Disney disks seem to sport these days. But once you get through them, it was a great experience. My kids are slightly old for Snow White, but they loved it anyway. It's so beautiful, with the rotoscoping, and the colors are so rich with this new print on blu ray... it's almost impossible not to enjoy this.<br /><br />As for the extra's, the games were kind of like most games on blu ray & dvd... silly & weak. But the documentaries were simply amazing. All that information about the making of the film, the history of Disney, amazing, interesting and entertaining stuff.<br /><br />It's worth picking this up if you have young kids. They're going to love it. You'll probably enjoy it too and then you can watch the documentaries and get more out of the purchase.

B0029QRA1U|5.0|If you're looking for an all-in-one, satisfying, affordable turntable solution, this guy is pretty much your best bet. It feels like it could be sturdier, but it doesn't feel flimsy or particularly cheap. It's actually quite satisfying to use.<br /><br />I got this so I could integrate it into my Home Theater PC setup, and it works wonderfully. There are a couple caveats, though:<br />1) The RCA cables come hardwired into the unit, and they are RIDICULOUSLY short. Like, 2 feet. If you're planning on using the RCA output, I'd recommend picking up some extension cables or something.<br />2) I don't know exactly how the software does the automatic track separation thing, but on more than one occasion the automatic track separation has failed; it'll rip two or more tracks as a single track. Doesn't happen all the time, but be prepared to have to prepare tracks manually on occasion.<br /><br />Overall, though, I'm happier with this purchase with every day that goes by. Also, a plus, it comes with the large RCA 45 spindle adapter, with its own mounting slot in the turntable platform. So if you have any 45s with the super-large RCA spindle, you're good to go, and it stores away neatly when you're not using it.

B001U5V03U|5.0|\\"DON GIOVANNI\\" is one of my two all-time favorite opera's, (the other is \\"La Traviata\\").  This dvd is one of 7 Don Giovanni's in my dvd collection, and as I  watched it last night, I knew within minutes it would become one of my favorites.  Simon Keenlyside is a brilliant stage actor, as well as a magnificent voice in opera.  He plays this Don Giovanni with a marvelous flair, and is a believable  seducer.  His voice is a joy to listen to.  Miah Persson is probably the best Zerlina I have seen.  Joyce Didonato was a passionate Donna Elvira.  The Spanish Madonna on the stage for much of the opera was a nice touch.  I also appreciate how the director brought forward the bonding of the women characters in  this production~ when Don Giovanni is exposed at the end of ACT I, the women   hold one knife together in their hands and point it at him.  Keenlyside's intensity  is riveting as his character escapes at the end of the scene.  I thought the singer portraying Leporello was fabulous also~ great energy, great voice, and definitely looks like the Leporello one imagines.  Ramon Vargas~ what a voice!  He is a gift to the opera world.  I loved this production, and as I said, of my 7 versions of this opera, this will be the one I return to most often.  My other fav is one with Carlos Alvarez and Ildebrando D'Arcangelo.   Simon Keenlyside brings Don Giovanni to life!  Beautifully!
B002FRNCG0|3.0|Paramore takes a very small and average leap in their new album Brand New Eyes. As usual, their songs are filled with lyrics of revenge and dealing with the aftermath of being backstabbed or other such tragedies that their teenage fanbase can relate to. As always, Hayley Williams has some extraordinary vocals. But let's face it, she shouldn't ever be compared to such female rockstar material as, to name a few, Amanda Palmer of the Dresden Dolls, Karen Oh of the Yeah Yeah Yeah, and especially not Lacey Mosley of Flyleaf.  Paramore has been the same for years, ever since their debut release of All We Know Is Falling. They prove this time around that they always sound the same. Always. Now, usually this works for a lot of bands. For example, Three Days Grace has never changed their sound, but at least their songs don't all seem to be exactly the same. Paramore, however, somehow manages to make one song sound exactly like another from previous albums.   I'm not saying Brand New Eyes was horrible, but it was definitely nothing exceptional. It's a good collection to add to my iPod, but let's face it. Their song Ignorance could easily be four minutes they forgot to add to Misery Business, and Brick By Boring Brick was just another rendition of CrushCrushCrush.  One thing that was good about it was the guitar work. As usual, Paramore proves quite superior with their layers of guitar work and clever riffs. Hayley Williams, as stated above, has very good vocals that fit the type of songs they're working with. Nevertheless, Brand New Eyes was nothing but substantially average work. I got sick of this CD within a week of its purchase. There were about four good songs, which is what I recommend for downloading. But don't waste your time with the whole album, I found myself severely disappointed.

Anyways I really luv this new CD alot!  I've been bumpin it non-stop after I got into the groove of it.  Right now my #1 favorite REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT song is \\"There Goes My Baby\\" buuut I love all the songs.  The only one that I could skip is \\"Papers\\" other than that I say GET THIS CD, Usher's doin the dang thing!
B002VPE1AW|1.0|To be clear, the movie's awesome & the 1-star rating pertains entirely to this money-grabbing scheme no doubt concocted by the 'powers-to-be' at the studios.

0446563048|5.0|\\"Delivering Happiness\\" provides a wealth of insight through business and personal stories.  In a way, it's a non-fiction business thriller.  The last chapter on the science of happiness should be read by everyone, and especially every college student before they choose a major.  Tony provides an if-you-love-them-set-them-free (my impression, anyway) kind of way to run a business.  What I mean is open and honest and supportive and trusting environment.  This very well could be the future of how businesses are run.    The beginning provides insights on Tony as a child and influences prior to Zappos.  (I hope to see some similar early signs of such business genius in my daughter.)  The majority of the book discusses the story of Tony and Zappos, providing the personal and business insights he gained along the way.  The end of the book, and a real gem, discusses how many people misunderstand what will give lasting happiness and how to better your aim.    This is much more than an academic book.  If someone asks \\"How'd you do it\\", \\"Delivering Happiness\\" gives the answer, and more.  Well done!
1584282584|5.0|I found this through a review on RonMart's photography blog. There are a few key techniques in this book that are critical for on-camera flash use:  * How to adjust exposure settings on camera to acheive proper exposure in challenging situations  * How to use swivel-head flash units to acheive the best lighting  * How to use simple (and cheap!) flash modifiers to get the results you want  * How to make your flash blend into the ambient light to avoid the \\"people pasted onto the background\\" look    Before reading this book, I had all but given up on using my Nikon SB600 on-camera - the results I was seeing were flat and washed out, even when I tried to bounce. With the techniques in this book, though, I can take much better photos with softer directional light without getting the flash directly into my daughter's eyes. I'm happier with my photos and my daughter's much more willing to have her photo taken.    Equipment I use: Nikon D80 with SB-600 swivel-head flash unit.    Note that this won't be useful for you if you just have a point-and-shoot or are using the builtin flash on a DSLR.
B00127RAJY|2.0|My opinion may be completely biased, as I'm pretty loyal to The Firm series, but I ordered this DVD just to switch things up a bit.  I'm at an intermediate/advanced fitness level (I work out 5-6 days/week) so I jumped right to the Level 2 workout.  I could definitely feel the moves working and I was sweating by the time my 20 minutes were up but it was exactly what people dread when they work out.  It was not fun AT ALL.  Just work.  Some people may enjoy that (and there's nothing wrong with that!!) but in order for me to stay motivated, I need to enjoy the movements I'm doing.  If I were just trying to get a workout program going and this was the first video I attempted....I would probably run for the hills and write off exercise forever.    So.....not only did I not enjoy the routine.....Jillian drove me crazy.  She did each of the movements for about 5 seconds, then hovered around the other two girls.  Her attempts to joke around with them just fizzled and the \\"clarifications\\" she gave didn't add anything for me.     Lastly - the girls themselves were not moving at the same pace.  This became problematic when I would begin w/ Jillian, continue when the camera panned to girl #1 (who, typically, was still working at the same rhythm), then switched views to girl #2...who NEVER seemed to be moving at the same pace and always threw me off.  So overall I think my point is clear.  I'm sure this video will give you results if the things I've described won't be bothersome to you.  Certainly not my thing!
B000EWBKK8|4.0|What's the difference between, let's say a 'country' sending military 'aid' to other governments that oppress their own people and sometimes attack, invade or occupy their neighbors and private arm dealers buying (usually small) arms from wherever they can and selling them for a profit to whomever can afford them? There are differences of scale. As Yuri Orlov notes toward the end of the movie, right before the credits begin to roll, the president of the United States sells more weapons in one day than he (Yuri) does in a full year. Then there's the issue of legality. Since it's the governments who decide what's legal and what's not, small fish like Orlov are known as 'gun runners' and they are to be viewed as evil or irresponsible. Unlike governments who usually 'spread freedom', provide 'aid' or help the nicer dictators, autocrats and internationally recognized oppressors fight 'extremism' or 'anarchy'. Unless the governments want to 'help' certain extremely vile states or 'movements', in which case they covertly use the little gun runners to funnel their support. 'Lord of War' ends with an interesting observation - nothing new or unexpected, a fact known to most of us but, somehow, hidden almost out of existence someplace rarely visited inside our mind: world's largest arms dealers are the 5, armed to the teeth,  permanent members of the Security Council: the United States, Russia, France, Great Britain, China.<br /><br />'Lord of War' is the story of Yuri Orlov, a small fish, private gun runner who makes a living for himself and his family by doing, illegally, a little bit of what legitimate governments do officially. People die while Yuri, most convincingly portrayed by Nicolas Cage, gets rich. And, while they are killing each other, it's worth noting that some of the weapons used by one side or sometimes both sides were provided by Yuri, often at great personal risk. Being small and a private individual, Yuri is constantly chased and harassed by agent Valentine of the Interpol and his life is a constant, dangerous and risky struggle of surviving his business dealings usually involving bloody dictators or drug dealers, keeping his marriage from falling apart and keeping Vitaly, his kid brother, from completely destroying himself by means of mass quantities of drugs consumption.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage acting is superb and so is Jared Leto's as Vitaly Orlov, Yuri's brother. All others are playing their parts well but this is mainly the story of Yuri and both the part and the actor easily eclipse the rest into 'supporting' parts. Besides Cage's acting, the effort to provide authenticity is remarkable - 100 tanks that Yuri is about to buy were real, not props, and they were indeed for sale and so are some of the behaviors attributed to some of the characters such as the Liberian president.<br /><br />'Lord of War' is a commendable effort at providing an inside view into the world of weapons commerce but, in the end, it misses the mark and even the movie's makers seem to be aware of it. Yes, it's true that private arms dealers sell arms but it's also true that their contribution to global mayhem is small to insignificant when compared to what the real market leaders, the world's big 'powers' can provide. It just may be that the problem is not that, as Yuri observes, one in twelve people owns a gun but that eleven out of twelve don't and they are often at the mercy of those who do. Far from being a lord of war, Yuri's character fulfills a need and, human nature being what it is, it's quite likely that someone else would step in the moment Yuri turned pacifist and, as history teaches us, people are quite capable of killing each other by the millions, with or without fire arms. Watching 'Lord of War' was not time wasted. The movie does have its moments but the impression it leaves is that... maybe movie makers wished they aimed a little higher or closer to the root causes of state instigated or state inflicted violence.<br /><br/>--<br />>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;/>--<br />>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! <<
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|When I first heard about this film from my daughter-in-law and knew it won the Academy Award I was definately interested in seeing it. Although the Title \\"Up\\" left me clueless I borrowed her copy to watch and figure out why they named it \\"Up\\". When I was a small girl (which was nearly a 100 years ago) the theme for movies like Disney made were pretty standard old childhood stories filmed like cartoons and later animated.  However, \\"Up\\" with all of its lively characters was delightful to watch as they all took on their original roles and played them out to perfection.  The sound, color, story and animation drew me into the film very easily and kept me there.  What was interesting also. was the fact that this story was more true to life then most.  Stuff happened, danger was present, competition was obvious, strong emotions, and goals (good and not so good) were ever present driving the characters foward. And in the end each character came away with many lessons learned. I have seen this movie twice now and plan on seeing it again soon. What was my favorite lines in this movie?  When Ellie says - \\"South America...its like North America just south and Cross your heart!\\" Do buy your own copy it's sweet and awesome with much to draw from. And the clue to what &Uuml;p\\" means is \\"Whatever you want it to mean!\\"  Catherine

As earlier reviews have noted, in the main this is actually a quite faithful representation of Holmes and Watson in light of the original stories (which I've read and, indeed, taught a number of times). At the same time, it's an excellent stylization of late Victorian England, and I think that's how it should be understood: at once a faithful interpretation that brings out all the pleasures of the original and a commentary on Victorian society as it transitioned into the twentieth century (which is, I'd hold, exactly what Doyle's stories were--a commentary on the modern). To quote from another well-known and frequently-adapted Victorian novel, it's \\"nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance.\\"    The structure of the story itself could well be one of Doyle's original stories. It especially reminds me of \\"The Adventure of the Speckled Band,\\" in which an apparently supernatural series of events turns out to have a logical explanation. This is what surprised me the most when I saw the movie for the first time: that it engaged Doyle's narrative strategies in film form. In fact, this engagement is incredibly detailed. For instance, the scenes early in the movie where Irene Adler visits Holmes at home exploit Doyle's typical doubleness: at first we get a strung-together series of events whose chain of cause and effect are unexplained. Then, later, we get a recap in which Holmes explains that chain in detail, supposedly to Watson but really to the viewing audience. This particular set of scenes is, I think, one of the most admirable in the movie. It works as an exploration of narrative (which was always Doyle's point anyway--see the numerous stories in which Holmes chides Watson for transcribing their \\"adventures\\" as, exactly, adventures, as opposed to scientific processes of reasoning), and it works so brilliantly because of the intelligence behind it. Even the soundtrack (by Hans Zimmer of Gladiator fame) underscores the narrative structure here: the first time the events are portrayed, they're given a particular musical theme, and when they're re-portrayed by Holmes they're given a theme that's the musical inverse of the original. It's an example of all the various elements of film-making coming together in a subtle and fascinating way to demonstrate a point.    This attention to detail, not to mention stylishness, is present in the entire movie. It has nary a narrative hole (with, I think, one slight exception, which I won't detail so as not to produce any plot spoilers) and its overall structure is admirable taut. In fact, the movie is littered with strikingly subtle details that remain unexplained (e.g. the recurrence of \\"V.R.\\", an abbreviation of \\"Victoria Regina,\\" or \\"Queen Victoria\\") by Holmes's narrative explications--the sheer quantity of detail in the movie points to the fascination with, precisely, detail that fascinates Holmes. (To cite just one more example: when Watson hands a newspaper to Holmes early in the movie, it features an ad for \\"Fry's Chocolates,\\" which was the family business that gave Roger Fry, one of the members of the Bloomsbury Group whose most famous member is Virgina Woolf, his fortune.)    The movie does take liberties with its source material, signally with the representation of Irene Adler. But it acknowledges that it's doing so in a number of clever, apparently offhand details. At one point, Watson notes that Adler has outsmarted Holmes \\"twice,\\" which indicates that the movie is adding on to the canon of Holmes stories--in Doyle's corpus, Adler appears exactly once (in \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\"), so Guy Ritchie openly acknowledges the extrapolations he's made in this movie. In short, the movie notes explicitly that it's an adaptation as part of its adaptation.    All of this works brilliantly because the actors are brilliant: Robert Downey Jr. displays his usual genius (shown in another recent action movie), Jude Law presents the kind of Watson that other adaptations have eschewed (an intelligent ladies' man quite in tune with Doyle's character), and Rachel McAdams represents Adler as a clever and daunting adversary, which is quite in keeping with Doyle's character. McAdams may be especially worth noting, as Adler is one of the most significant as well as mysterious characters in the Holmes universe--her character is probably the biggest departure from the original in the movie, and McAdams carries it well. The cinematography is stylish and the soundtrack is excellent and really catchy. There are a couple of faults--some obvious day-for-night shooting and some clear CG--but I'm willing to indulge these because of the movie's overall excellence.    Basically, this movie is exactly what Hollywood used to produce and what it wishes it could achieve now: an intelligent, entertaining, and subtle movie that invites some effort on the viewer's part but also entertains enormously.    I'm looking forward to the sequel!
B000AMPZF8|5.0|The music on this album is fantastic. It is darker and wilder compared to their newer albums, which is probably a result from them being younger at the time. They have definitely grown with their music. As for the accusations against them for \\"copying\\" other styles, that is completely unfounded. Give me one example of someone who has not, at one time or another, \\"borrowed\\" off of someone else. The wonderful thing about growth is that you look at and experiment on what others have done, and you EXPAND upon it and make it your own. Muse has developed their own style, and it has taken time. Greatness does not always come out of the blue. It needs to be worked hard for, and these gentlemen have done that quite well.

Watched all four episodes in one sitting..very very good!
B002X9GX4S|5.0|I'm really excited that this band was able to breach that usual sophomore drop-out and successfully complete a third album. I would like to note that this third album has been a blast! It is a little different from their previous CDs, but I think it's way better! Alesana has not only made a third album, but one that improved a lot! Not to say that I disliked the other albums, because I thought they were quite enjoyable, but the concept album is out of this world. The storyline receives top marks, and the music itself is full and haunting. No fillers here which is amazing for a concept album, (If you don't know, most bands can't pull that off, even veterans that have been at the art for a lot longer). This is a must buy!
0061537969|2.0|The concept is neat but the execution is flawed.  The book has several childish black and white moralistic rants which took away from the concept for me.  Not that I disagree with the content of the rants, it just wasn't sophisticated writing.  The best scene of the book was when the owner takes his dog out on the track. The rest... Let's just say that I finished the book because I paid $9 bucks for it.

B0001XAPY2|5.0|While this film of course has its share of silly, slapstick comedy a child may enjoy; the theme itself has a 1950s Bogart quality to it.  You can throw in this movie and Casablanca and see where I'm going at.  I enjoyed the movie not just as a beautifully animated feature, but a wonderful story that could be retold as an Oscar-worthy live action feature film.  I would highly recommend this to fans of Studio Ghibli, Bogart classics, romance, action, and suspense.

Bottom line...If you want to read a chronicle of how dangerous and ridiculous Wall Street has become read this book.

B000UNYJV8|5.0|This Is England is most definitely one of the very best British films of the twenty-first century and ranking as Shane Meadows most outstanding to date. Meadows draws on his own personal experiences as a skin head during the early 1980's. This Is England is set during the summer months of 1983 at the time of \\"Thatcher's Britain\\" and indeed the era of the skinheads, punk, racism and facism.    Shaun (Thomas Turgoose) is a lonely 11 year old kid growing up on a rough council estate in the North Of England. He is grieving the sudden loss of his father after he was killed in the horrific Falklands War. Encountering incessant bullying at school, Shaun meets a gang of friendly, multi-racial, dope-smoking skin heads, headed by Woody (Joseph Gilgunn) who immediately are drawn to his sadness and confusion and subsequently take the boy under their wing. However when one of the gang's old members Combo, (Stephen Graham) a vicious, racist thug and bully, is released from prison, Shaun is manipulated by Combo's way of thinking and racist attitude and turns into a thug himself, convinced he would be making his late Dad proud. After Combo brutally beats up Shaun's friend Milky (Andrew Shim) and exposes his own deep vulnreability and unbalanced mental state, Shaun comes back down to earth (and his senses), realising the lifestyle he'd been leading was not really for him, nor would it have made his Dad proud.    Though the first half of This Is England is touchingly funny, drawing on the allure and fun of being in a gang, the second half soon makes way for a much darker, raw and gritty nature, with many violent episodes and highlighting the brutally stark racism that existed at the time (and still does unfortunately!). Shane Meadows shrewdly evokes the total working-class despair of \\"Thatcher's Britain\\", capturing the era impeccably well and impressively authentic in detail.    Like every other of Shane Meadows absolutely superb films, the acting and dialogue is astutely naturalistic, drawing you in from the opening scene. Most outstanding of all is the immensely talented youngster Thomas Turgoose who's almost stark performance never once shrinks from being anything but utterly powerful and beleavable. Indeed the cast are all thoroughly excellent that includes another notably powerful turn from the ever-brilliant Stephen Graham as Combo; Joseph Gilgunn as the loveable, kindly rogue Woody who is the leader of the gang that Shaun first joins and who also refuses to be brainwashed by Combo's unhinged way of thinking and racial hatred; Jo Hartley as Shaun's mum Cynth who upon meeting the gang headed by Woody becomes charmed by them herself it seems, after having had serious reservations when first seeing her young son with a shaved head; Andrew Shim as the friendly Milky; Vicky McClure as the more sensible, level-headed Lol and Rosamund Hanson as the eccentric but likeable Smell.    Extra features on this DVD edition is endearing audio commentary to the film by writer and director Shane Meadows, producer Mark Herbert and the greatly talented young lead actor Thomas Turgoose.    Truly an out and out masterpiece, This Is England is an often funny, often shocking and often deeply moving portrait of a moment in British cultural history.    Ian Phillips  April 2010
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Epic in its scope, sweeping in its unhidden philosophical implications, this movie is a call to arms for everyone fed up with corporatism-militarism and profiteering at all costs that is endemic to our body politic and culture.<br /><br />There are those who will go through all sorts of rationalizations to deny this, to tell us that it is JUST a movie and that it has no meaning, no implications, no significance whatever beyond mindless entertainment.<br /><br />But there is a prompt and overwhelming refutation of that point of view to be had immediately - WATCH THE MOVIE.<br /><br />A MAGNIFICENT achievement at all levels.  Many thanks to James Cameron and the thousands of people and long hours of work involved in producing this blockbuster!<br /><br />Also, I have not yet checked, having just seen it, but I hope their will be a novelization of this great film ... with the idealogical parts included!<br /><br />And if there are more complete versions of it coming out later in the year, I'll be happily getting those too!<br /><br />Thanks again!
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki, the master filmmaker from the Academy Award-winning, \\"Spirited Away\\", really outdid himself in his first true feature length film with Studio Ghibli.  Nausicaa is filled with heart, hope, and gives an unprecedented perspective on the natural world and the humanitarian role with it.  I can watch this movie over and over again and still see it for the first time.  It is exciting and suspenseful; with scenery hand-painted so beautifully that no computer-animated film could match.  I would recommend this movie to everyone, both young and small.

0439023483|5.0|It's a good thing I knew there was a Book 2 when I picked up \\"The Hunger Games\\" to read. As librarian in a PK-8 Catholic school, I like to keep current with what middle schoolers, at least, are reading. After one of the girls asked for \\"Catching Fire,\\" Book 2 in the series, I dug out my copy of \\"The Hunger Games,\\" with knowledge, then, that I was getting into a series.<br /><br />And oh, what a story! Initially, the title was misleading (to me). \\"More vampire stuff,\\" methought. Not at all! It's a post-apocalyptic theme, a dystopian setting, and Big Brother and associates all enveloped into a young adult novel with a clever female protagonist pitting wits against the Establishment (in each case only because she is forced into situations requiring such actions).<br /><br />Katniss lives in Zone 12 (out of 13 in the newly formed country after war destroyed the old one.) Zone 1 is the ruling province and strictly runs a Big Brother kind of operation. At the end of each year one boy and one girl, between ages 12 and 18, are chosen via food gain/lottery to fight--literally--for gains for the coming year for their families and residual effects for the zone. There can be only one winner and 25 dead competitors.<br /><br />So, Kat joins the competition after an initial substitution halt. Then there's back story to join the reader with the current situation concerning Peeta, the boy who will also represent Zone 12. In fact, one of the advisers plants a relationship between Peeta and Kat to add a love interest to the contest. Without going into any detail, I'll just say that this love interest works far beyond expectations and for unexpected reasons.<br /><br />As with any young adult novel, hard decisions are made, alliances are formed and broken, and outcome is questionable. Cameras are ubiquitous. If action ceases for too long, BB stirs it up again with awful means. Tricks are rife. There, I've summarized the story without a single spoiler and you, dear reader, won't know what happens unless you read the book.<br /><br />I will note: There's a nice twist at the end, which leads directly into Book 2. So far, this is an excellent series. How do I know? Because I can't wait to read Book 2 and learn the meaning of the title. Where can the story go from the end of Book 1?

B000MTFFZY|4.0|Thank you Mr.Joss reviewer. I bought this CD as a result of your own detailed review. At first I was quite disappointed and then found myself wanting to listen to it more often. Though others have compared this artist to pop (I did so myself at first, probably because I was listening to lot of Tristania during that week), I have become to realize that this is actually a complex band, with a lot of maturity if considering they have only been together few years. They are exciting and willing to experiment. Vocals are finally clean enough where one can enjoy, have fun with(and understand) them, yet there is the right touch of grunts and harsh male vocals as well when needed. I have over 50 CDs now of symphonic and goth metal music(female fronted) and from having listened to those and hundreds more of tracks and videos on youtube and lastfm, it is my opinion that this is not a \\"wanna be\\" imitation of a band. I believe that one must stop using Nightwish or Epica or WT as the rule by which all are judged. There are many talented bands (other than those giants that initially, most likely, introduced many of us to this genre - and Evanescence being one of them, sorry but I had to give them tribute) working to develop their unique sound, and this band is one of them. It may require \\"a few listen\\" to fully appreciate the complexity of the harmonics/vocals, but I am going to give it another shot and buy the next CD as well. If they can pull it through without going the electro/pop/techno route, then they should be able to find their place in the ever so crowded Dutch and Scandinavian music scene. And there is nothing wrong in having one or two CDs that on the surface may appear less intense, is there? Being a big fan of lyrics, I can say that this album has some beautiful ones and that some bands that may profess to be much \\"doomier\\" have much less gothic rhymes. Screams and growls a goth doth not make. To be further assessed after purchase of the April Rain CD. Greetings.
0061914177|3.0|I personally find Gary Vaynerchuk incredibly annoying.  But, he's like Rachel Ray -- yappy and annoying, but there's some wisdom in there if you can stand to sit through it.  If you like Vaynerchuk already, and have any aspirations at all do get a better job or start your own business, you'll love this book.      I think the worst part of the book is that when I read it I can hear him yelling it all at me, which is why I can't tolerate his podcasts.  But, he's got some wisdom.  I got this book because I'm planning to start a business, and I know I need to use modern marketing techniques.  This guy knows what's what for today's businesses, and I definitely got some good, useful information out of the book.  But, I did cruise through it pretty quickly, like flipping through a TV show on Tivo -- hopefully I didn't miss any little nuggets of wisdom, because I don't think I can stand to peruse through the book again.
B003IHN90K|5.0|I am not a Madonna fan.  However, GLEE could have used ANY entertainer it wanted to use if the end result was for me to see at long last Sue perform musically.  She was fantastic. Sue gets into Madonna costuming and then sings and dances beautifully. In fact, Sue dominates this whole episode from start to finish as she is the one to declare the school an all Madonna all the time facility, her music blaring at top volume from the PA into all classrooms. Sue, seen in a Madonna pointed black bra over her tracksuit in the principal's office, will remain with me forever as a visual image.  I've never seen this actress before, Jane Lynch, but as far as I'm concerned, she can headline her own show, she is so good. The rest of show was more romantic angst among all the other players which was ok but in my book Sue stole the show right out from underneath them this week.

B00005JKJA|5.0|I don't think I am going out on a limb in saying David Lynch is one strange fellow.  You only have to watch \\"Eraserhead\\" to confirm my belief.<br /><br />\\"Mulholland Drive\\" is the best of Lynch's strange movie making efforts. However the viewer must give this work their full attention from opening to end.  It is one of the few movies I ever watched that demanded an immediate second viewing, as I did not understand it fully until the very end which was, for me, a Eureka moment.<br /><br />I consider this movie \\"great\\" because it has all the elements that in my opinion make it worth watching.  It grabs ones attention at the very beginning and holds it throughout. Mr. Lynch never talks down to his audience, on the contrary he assumes the viewer is a bright, intelligent, inquisitive person and he constructs his entertainment in such a manner as to tax that intelligence and reward the curiosity. Additionally this movie is simply great fun.  In trying to figure out what's going on and why, the viewing time of 2-hours and 27-minutes, passes like the speed of light.  I don't think I changed my body position once the entire time.<br /><br />I can understand why so many either love or hate this movie.  If your entertainment time consists of mostly situation comedies on TV it would be best to avoid David Lynch. If on the other hand, heh, heh... you are in for the consummate movie going treat.

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I first read P&P in college and some years later was thrilled to see the wonderful adaptation starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth.  It was so good and followed the book so well that I wondered what was the purpose of remaking this story and in such an inferior way. I do not believe that I am being nitpicking when I say that at the time of the story, women would never have been seen with such messy hair and clothing.  Even the poorer class ones (which the Bennets most certainly were NOT) would never have lived and dressed the way they are depicted in this ridiculous film.  Pigs in the yard and such dirty surroundings!  Really!  It looked more like Tobacco Road than the home of British gentry!  The characters also were badly interpreted especially Mr. Bingley who was a real wuss and one wonders what did Jane see in him besides his money.  Did screen writers or director even crack the book? They certainly did not study the history and social customs of the time. I thought this movie might at least be passable, but I found it abysmal and stupid!
1594488843|5.0|Daniel Pink has hit this one out of the park, again! Finally, someone has connected the dots on motivation, and why our system doesn't work. We've been starring at those dots for decades. Pink point out that, for all practical purposes, management hasn't changed in a 100 years. Leaders and managers cannot motivate employees; not really. People motivate themselves, it's internal. Leaders and managers can only inspire people and provide an environment that allows them the full range of intrinsic motivation wherever possible.<br /><br />Pink organized this excellent book on motivation into three parts: A New Operating System, The three elements and the Type I toolkit. He also provided an excellent summary of the whole new system model at the end titled \\"Drive: The Recap\\" beginning on page 203. I found this summary to be immensely useful and I expect it will be going forward as I refer back to Drive in the future.<br /><br />I found the reports on experiments with primates by Harry Harlow, professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin, to be particularly enlightening. Based on the results, Harlow offered a novel theory--what amounted to a third drive: \\"The performance of the task,\\" he said, \\"provided intrinsic reward.\\" The primates, in this case monkeys, solved the puzzles simply because the found it gratifying to solve puzzles. They enjoyed it. The joy of the task was its own reward. The first drives are the lower stages on Maslow's hierarchy of needs - food, shelter, procreation, etc. The second drive is what we are used to, the extrinsic, carrot and stick kinds of motivation we typically employ in business - bonuses, commissions, etc. The experiments did not provide either of the first two motivations for these monkeys. The simply wanted to solve the puzzle for the joy of it. This vignette sets the tone and foundation for the rest of the book.<br /><br />The next piece in this motivation puzzle are the experiments conducted and reported by Edward Deci (Carnegie Mellon University). In short, what Deci found was that \\"When money is used as an external reward for some activity, the subjects lose intrinsic interest for the activity.\\" Rewards can deliver a short-term boost--just as a jolt of caffeine can keep you cranking for a few more hours. But the effect wears off--and, worse, can reduce a person's longer term motivation to continue the project.<br />Pink refers to Motivation 1.0 as that early time in our evolution when we needed to survive. That is the time of living in the Fight, Flight, Food or Procreate stage of development of our species. Motivation 2.0 came in with the advent of the industrial age, time studies and piece work (my summary, not his). But now, we must move to Motivation 3.0 and that is what Drive is all about. Why? Because while Motivation 2.0 (carrot & stick stuff) works some of the time for prescriptive tasks, it isn't reliable even for those tasks and certainly doesn't work well for the more creative work we have in front of us now. \\"The consulting firm McKinsey & Co. estimates that in the United States, only 30 percent of job growth now comes from algorithmic work, while 70 percent comes from heuristic work.\\"  In my opinion, this all lines up with the trend toward what Pink wrote about years ago in Free Agent Nation. America alone has more than 18 million \\"non-employer businesses\\" - businesses without any paid employees.<br /><br />It's fascinating to me that we have all seen the data that points to the fact that what Pink refers to as Motivation 2.0 simply isn't reliable and in the more creative, free-thinking projects we believe will \\"save our country's economy,\\" and yet we haven't made the changes necessary. Personally, I believe a lot has to do with the fact that when we first join the workforce, we often times assume that what we learned in the academic environment is either wrong or out of date. I clearly remember leaving engineering school and thinking that the education I got, while certainly useful, did not prepare me for what was really going on in the \\"real world.\\" Similarly, when I finished my MBA course, I thought, wow, this stuff is interesting but it isn't the way we run things at the company at all. And that included the system we have in place for rewarding \\"good behavior,\\" and punishing \\"bad behavior.\\" I know for a fact that this system doesn't work, and I suspect that you feel the same way.

This movie is hilarious!  It's even funnier than the Return Of The Living Dead movies because in the first Return, they basically played the whole thing straight, they just put in a few jokes.  Then in the second Return, well, that one was just dumb, and third Return was so idiotic we could barely watch it.  Shaun Of The Dead is smart and clever.  The heros are sort of boners but in a Monty Python sarcastic way.  The gore is awesome!  Love tether ball pole!  Whap!  Whap!  Stab!!!  This movie is great fun any zombie lover.
0812550706|4.0|I've seen this book in libraries, on best-of lists, and pretty much everywhere. But I've always dismissed it because of the cover and the premise which just seemed corny and something meant for 14-yr-old StarWars fans. So I was surprised when I saw my math teacher reading it. My math teacher is pretty, in her early 20's, and a conservative Bible-thumper, so I was curious to what she saw in it. Once I see somebody with a book in their hands, I become very nosy. Her rave review convinced me to read it.<br /><br />What can I say about this book is that it's very fun and entertaining. I read it in one day. The sci-fi itself was pretty basic, and the most interesting part for me was Ender's trials at Battle School. Even though I had trouble following the null gravity battles. I did not understand Ender's explanation at all. It seems I would not be fit for Battle School :(<br /><br />The most unbelievable part for me was the age of these kids. They were very young, yet talked like your average adult. I understand they were supposed to be genius's and everyone was chosen as the best in something, but the only I saw that in Ender. I wish I could have known the other characters more.<br /><br />The \\"twist\\" ending didn't surprise me as much as the final chapter did. It just seemed so completely different from the rest of the book. I'm not sure whether or like it or not. This book definitely made me think in places.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend it to sci-fi and non sci-fi fans alike. I'm interested to read the sequels to see what happens to their universe afterward, if I can find them at the library. The library has a nasty habit of only carrying some books in a series- and never the ones I want.
1416955070|5.0|What can i say, i'm reading this book for the 4th time and i still love it. The plot, the characters, I love them all, but i must admit that I love anime & manga and this book is like a manga made novel, so don't be so harsh with Cassandra because she made a wonderful history, a mix, if you want to see it like that...    I have the three books and they are my treasures ;)      **sorry for my english...I can read it but i can't write it...
B002VECM6S|5.0|I absolutely loved the movie.  In a day where you are almost forced to hear profanity and see unnecessary nudity, it is great to see a movie with a true theme and decency.  We need more.
B000RJO578|5.0|We bought this movie because of Shaun Of The Dead and Simon Pegg doesn't disappoint!!!  The writing in these two movies is snappy, smart, sinister, and rock 'em sock'em full of surprises!  There's even good acting!  A big part of this movie doesn't have any action at all, just people dealing with relationships, but it's quirky and fun and surprisingly real, you know?  They make you think about what it's all about.  Life.  Men and women.  Wow!  Anyway, when the poop finally hits the fan, the fan is going at high speed if you know what I mean.  Some of the gunfight sequences are absolutely AWESOME!!!!  These guys are as cool as cool can be, but always with that dry British gently sarcastic smile.  I love it!!!!  Hot Fuzz is full of twists and turns and good heroes you really want to root for, sweet on the inside, tough on the outside.  Ten stars!!!
B002VPE1B6|2.0|I'll start off by saying that yes the special effects are something to behold, but in this day and age i just wish some directors would go back old school, ditch the super CGI effects and make a great film with a great story. There is no substance here, it lacks any \\"real\\" plot other than the corruption(again like Aliens and Terminator) of a coporate greedy company who wants to scathe the land for its own profit regardless of the outcome. They are on the planet to collect a rock called Unubtainium, i mean come on is that the best you get from James Camerons mind? As in unubtainable get it huh? huh? The movie starts as a very adult kind of film right out of the box with the gds and other four letter expletives, then once they start to move into the Avatar bodies its like a Disney adventure with strange looking creatures and horrible kidish dialogue. To me the Navu' look silly and i just couldnt take the movie seriously or even with a grain of salt for that matter. It just seemed like Aliens meets Pochahontus and seemed more for kids than adults, remove the adult language and thats basically what you would have had. I was pretty siked when it first came out, it just looked like an awesome spectical for the eyes which is \\"all\\" it turned out to be. I was also excited to see the return of Seagorney Weaver after all these years but her dialogue seemed as though she was being forced to play Ellen Ripley(Aliens movies) and not herself, especially when  she first gets out of the cryostasis chamber and rants \\"Where my God D cigarette\\". Sam Worthington did a pretty noble job and carried the movie from an actors perspective very well, much like with Clash Of The Titans, i look forward to him in some more down to earth drama type rolls in the future. So this movie is basically just a puffed up CGI fest for people to watch on there Plasma and LCD tvs, nothing more nothing less. I personally would by the Lovely Bones on Blu ray before this, and i just may, at least Peter Jackson is laying of the super special effects for awhile, so come on James make another epic Titanic or even a last Terminator, or Aliens movie, thats what people want believe me i know.
B0015DROBO|1.0|An awful book.  I was disappointed in so much about this book, but mostly that I bought it because it had such high reviews from so many.  It is main-stream, pop-culture writing and I realize that this is not my favorite genre.  I don't think it's even worth much as an \\"escape\\" or \\"beach read\\" book.  I was disappointed in the writing style and content.  At times the images and content's graphic nature is disturbing.  Wish I could unread this.

1400052173|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Wrtten well for a scientist or a lay person to understand. All of us have benefited from Henerietta Lacks contribution yet she has been virtually unknown until now.  The contrast between the life and perspective of the doctors and scientists and the Lacks family is astounding.  The author did an amazing job of presenting both sides of the story without making judgements.

B000P0J024|5.0|This is a magical collection of songs delivered by a very rare collaboration of music legends.  The tiny little window of chance, opportunity, and circumstance that opened for this event to even happen is immeasurable. These artists did not let greed, vanity, or ego stand in the way of friendship and admiration.  The collection combines super talent with super songs and sprinkles it all with wit and humor. The results of this blend of profound talent, the likes of which the world will never see again, is a must have.
B00003XACV|5.0|After re-watching American Beauty, I realized that the dreamy music IS the movie, that and Mena Suvartii's dream sequences. Similar to the way Twin Peaks wouldn't have seemed nearly as good without it's soundtrack. This is not the American Beauty soundtrack; this is the Original Motion Picture Score. The hypnotic Xylophone Music that plays during Kevin Spacy's monologues and visions of Mena Suvartii in a bed of roses.
B002L9N4EM|5.0|This was the first time that I had ever ordered anything on-line and I was a little bit nervous about the whole process.

The delivery was really fast and I would use it again.    Tina Smith

B003405MF6|1.0|Yes, Jeff is the Master, but I think JB has been spending way too much time with Corporate blues sell out, Eric Clapton.  No fire, not even good background music. Don't waste your money on this dog. Buy 'Live at Ronnie Scotts' if you want to hear Beck wail!
B000WCBPOG|2.0|I purchased this thinking it was all the music from the film.  Our favorite song, I Want You, is NOT ON THIS CD SET!  The other music is okay, but I have it all already, but sung by the beatles or other artists.  The Song I WANT YOU as sung in the movie is NOT on this product.  Be Aware!
0385341008|5.0|What a precious book! Written in letter format, it may help to write down a few facts about each character for a few chapters, but once they come alive with distinctive personalities, they never fail the reader. I found myself laughing out loud at times and shed a tear or two.  It is the perfect read for someone who enjoys Jan Karon books. No cursing or skin, but the horrors and heartaches of WWII on the Channel Islands are vividly remembered.  When I closed the book I felt as if I had left the island and my friends. What fun.
B0036SSZIC|1.0|I have seen other Michael Moore films that subvert the truth to support his opinion.  He is a most dishonest man making very dishonest movies.  In this movie, capitalism is a name of a system that causes unfair things to happen to people.  These unfair things are not a result of capitalism but rather because life in general is not fair.  Capitalism is a method of allocating resources based upon their best economic value and return.  Another way of saying this is that capitalism places money where it is most efficiently and beneficially used.  It is not perfect because nature is not perfect, nor is man.  Capitalism and its market based system of resource allocation is indifferent to whether an individual is wealthy or poor.  It is economically blind as it relates to you or me.  However, capitalism, as a free market system, does need to be regulated to assure that it is generally performing reasonably well as a system.  Our capitalist system requires continued monitoring to assure its viability.  Without regulation it does not work in everyone's best interest and with over-regulation, the same unfavorable result can occur.<br /><br />All societies require laws to protect one person from another.  Such laws are generally very clear when they deal with physical harms caused by a person to another.  But our laws are not clear when dealing with economic equality because they cannot alter the charater or talents of an individual when compared to another.  Some people are going to be richer and some poorer.  There is no way to guarantee equality, nor should there be, unless we will be satisfied with no competition, no growth, no new ideas, no technolgical advancement or no improvements in medical care, among many other advancements that are caused by people who are smarter or work harder than others.  Our tax laws compensate substantially for economic differences among people and their ability or willingness to improve our overall well being, but there can never be an assurance of economic equality so long as one person is smarter or works harder than another.  Our tax laws actually limit the proclivity of such virtues.  It seems that Michael Moore would like to criminalize differences among people.  How can you say to a young person that he or she better not be too smart or work too hard becaused it may result in another person having less, or feeling inferior to you.  Mr. Moore's films are very critical but never suggest answers to what he says are problems.  If you are critical but have no alternatives to offer, then you are part of the problem.<br /><br />What Michael Moore is suggesting is that our system is bad because it does not confer the same level of economic security to all people.  I do not know how much Mr. Moore makes from his films taking advantage of our inequality, but I suspect his message of inequality does not apply to him.  Mr. Moore makes his money by making others disatisfied with their lives and gives them an excuse to be disatisfied.  For this, I believe his film making does a tremendous disservice to our society.  If I had to choose a word to describe him, it would be \\"liar\\" for not telling the whole truth.  His films are lies for the same reason.ance of economic equality so long as one person is smarter or works harder than another.  Our tax laws actually limit the proclivity of such virtues.

B001HN6940|5.0|Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland is a great movie! All of the actors did a great job. This is a good movie for the whole family.<br />It tells the story of what happens when Alice returns to Underland, but she doesn't remember anything about it. Johny Depp was great as the Mad Hatter. It is a funny movie with a good plot and story. My family and I saw it in 3D twice and we can't wait to buy the Blu-ray combo pack.<br />Definitely see this movie!
B001993Y2C|5.0|THREE WORDS: AWESOME TV SERIES  The blu-ray edition is outstanding...   The bad side: the packaging is terrible.
B00337KMAA|5.0|When I first heard about this movie, all I knew was that George Clooney plays a character who spends most of his time traveling. Consequently, I couldn't imagine why it got so much critical acclaim. After seeing it, I agree completely with the acclaim and highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a great and interesting drama/comedy. The acting is wonderful, the writing is engaging and witty, and the story is a little unusual.    Ryan Bingham (Clooney) works for a company whose business is informing people they've been fired by their employers. Personally, I didn't know such a business existed, but I can see how some bosses might actually hire other people to do their firing for them. Ryan clearly has been doing his job for many years and while he doesn't enjoy firing people, he knows how to handle it well. The part of his job he actually enjoys is the constant travel; he's only in his own apartment for a few days a year. Then along comes Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) who's almost fresh from college and sells the company on the idea of firing people remotely instead of traveling to do it in person. Ryan and Natalie end up traveling together to allow Natalie to see how things are currently done and to test the new system. Natalie developed this new idea without ever being involved personally with firing someone before.    Relationships - and the avoidance of them - are integral to the story. Ryan makes additional money doing speeches on how not to weigh yourself down, an idea which includes keeping some distance from others. He meets Alex, who seems to be his female counterpart in many ways, while traveling and they begin a casual relationship. On the opposite side of the spectrum, Natalie has a boyfriend and cannot understand Ryan's approach to life. It's clear Ryan even keeps his family at a distance when his sister's wedding comes up. Still, he does care for his family and even begins to connect more with Alex, so he asks her along as his guest.    With astory quite unlike his previous success \\"Juno\\", Jason Reitman has again done a superb job balancing drama and comedy. It even includes a couple of unexpected twists which will leave you thinking. The theme of layoffs is naturally especially relevant today, but the story doesn't get so bogged down as to become too depressing.
1439153663|4.0|I'm torn in reviewing this book. There are a lot of readers who will eat this book up like molasses candy. Others, who want more from a book...original characters, say, and a plot that doesn't telegraph itself from ten miles away, are going to be disappointed.  The plot has been outlined in other reviews. Little Lavinia's parents, while fleeing the Irish potato famine, die aboard one of Captain Pyke's ships. Since they were to work off their passage, he takes their 5 year old daughter as his indentured slave instead.<br /><br />Fortunately, she is to be a house slave and is allowed to stay in the kitchen house, where she is taken under the wing of the wise and loving housekeeper(Hello Mammy...didn't I meet you at Tara?)and protected by the sultry, beautiful and enigmatic Belle (secretly the daughter of Captain Pyke, whoa nelly, whoda thunk it).<br /><br />Lavinia is better off with the slaves. Mrs. Pyke is insane and opium addicted. Mr. Pyke is incompetent, uncaring and so disengaged from his family, he must have been on crack.  Their son is evil, dissolute, alcoholic and insane. The overseer is 100% pure evil, a rapist and possible pedophile, as well as incompetent and dishonest. The farmers in the area are evil, sadistic and murderous. Come on...even Sodom wasn't this bad.<br /><br />The Kitchen House has rapes, murder, incest, child molestation, beatings, whippings and burnings galore. Not one stereotype is left unturned. the plot is a retread of every Southern Gothic ever written--but it's not a really terrible book. It's at least one step up from those novels where the impoverished but wellborn governess meets the strangely aloof lord of the manner, rough, passionate kisses are exchanged, and something weird may be living in the attic. Since The Kitchen House does not have a particularly happy endings, to some readers, it may even pass as sophisticated. It wasn't my cup of tea; Even so, I had to give it 4 stars.  Fans of the genre will adore it, and that's for whom the author intended her work.er work.

1442300051|5.0|fascinating reading, helps explain the current GoldmanSachs/ Paulson controversy.  Complicated CDO's and Credit default swaps explained in entertaining style.  Highly recommended.
0345350499|4.0|This book is a great book.  Although it is a tough read, and trying to keep the characters straight is hard, the story line is great!  You must be prepared for a lenghtly read, it will take you awhile to get through it all.  The first part of the book is just OK but once you get into Part 2-4, it really picks up.  If you like reading about King Arthur era, you'll love this book.
0393072231|1.0|Mr. Lewis clearly hates Wall Street and seems to me to be a full-on Socialist.  And, although I am sure he will resent the label, I use the term descriptively, not simply in a pejorative sense.  He was gleeful on Charlie Rose on April 20 (2010) over the SEC lawsuit against Goldman Sachs and completely dismissive of the legal merits of the case.  The focus of his literary/intellectual efforts all seem to be directed at finding every opportunity to smear the profit motive.  Thus, whether the buy-side participant in the Abacus transaction was a sophisticated investor who should be able to stand on its own two feet and make a judgment as to the investment it was making is irrelevant to Mr. Lewis; something to be glossed over and dismissed.  Many people share his view that financial markets are corrupt and want their suspicions reinforced, so the book will likely do very well.  Again, Mr. Lewis will likely not appreciate the Socialist label, but this is a subtlety some readers may miss.  Thus, I share this more plain spoken assessment so that those who might otherwise have missed his message can subsidize their confederate.    Houston, TX  April 21,2010
030745455X|5.0|Larsson's second book, The Girl Who Played with Fire, adds many more layers to Lisbeth's character by revealing her past trauma which has defined her strengths. So often we are quick to judge and think we know who people are. It is easy for human nature to misjudge Lisbeth as weird or strange, because she's untrusting, constantly \\"on guard\\" and reclusive, when, in reality, she is brilliant. Larsson has created a truly incredible character in Lisbeth Salander who will stay in your memory for years to come. In taking the time to understand Lisbeth, the seemingly stand-offish introvert, it is possible to gain greater understanding of ourselves. Larsson does a terrific job creating sympathy and admiration for her. Her violent behavior sometimes makes it hard to differentiate her from the criminals who are tracking her. The reading moves quickly because of the intrigue, despite the book's length, and the author's gradual revelations about Lisbeth's background add to the suspense and make her actions totally unpredictable.<br /> The writing is excellent, the story is exciting; there's a lot of high drama and the characters are unforgettable. Salander and Blomkvist make a great team with the finest and most unique partnership. What more can a reader ask for?
B000FA5TTW|4.0|The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold is both haunting and intriguing.  It is the type of book that will stay with you after you've read the last page.  The books starts with Susie Salmon recounting her murder when she 14.  What follows is a beautiful account that is a sort of coming of age story.  I was touched by Susie's version of heaven and her neutrality in the aftermath of her murder.  There were so many \\"missed memories\\" for Susie throughout the years spanning the book yet she was never bitter.  It is a bittersweet recounting of loss and mourning of a young girl.  The writing style was magnificent.  I thought the prose was amazing and I found several passages quite touching.    Although I felt the book lost a bit of its momentum near the end, I was satisfied with the conclusion.  I feel that the ending made sense and came full circle.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|Blu-ray play needs to have storage space or it will not load. Thankfully mine accepts a usb drive, but there really should be away to skip the extra content and go directly to the movie.
B001C4AFOY|3.0|As others have mentioned, the costumes and scenery alone are worth watching the movie for. The acting is wonderful, Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend are passionate and emotive.<br /><br />The problem stems from messy, unresolved plot holes. A lot of relationships are left undeveloped, and as a result I found it hard to emotionally connect to any minor characters enough to care about their plot threads. When you have such an amazing ensemble cast (Miranda Richardson, Mark Strong, Paul Bettany, Jim Broadbent, etc.) not making the most of them seems almost shocking. Their parts came and went without much ado.<br /><br />I would have liked to see a bit more development in the romance between Victoria and Albert; the film did a great job showing their correspondence and how excited each was when receiving a letter from the other, but failed to include more than one or two little moments together before expecting the audience to believe in their grounded love for one another.<br /><br />The driving conflict seems to be Victoria finding her footing despite ill advice, youth, and inexperience; her and Albert's common desire to help the disenfranchised is a great strength, but is never mentioned again after Victoria and Albert are married. They are never seen to do the work that seemingly brought them together.<br /><br />With just a few little moments added, a few strings tied, a few characters given proper send-offs, it COULD have been utterly moving...but I suspect many of the scenes that would have made this film great rather than good are hiding on the cutting room floor. I can only hope for a Director's Cut at some point!
B002VECM6S|5.0|Excellent movie based upon true story.  Wealthy family takes in a homeless boy and how everyone invovled have their lives changed
0684824906|5.0|As an infrequent student of American History, I embarked on this reading as entry into a pool too cold. While I dipped in my toes they were seized by the Poseidonal strength of narrative that Goodwin has created. I have had my head-down in furious absorption of the brilliant portrayal of a collection of figures that now seem to have no rivals in my experience or mind. My life, heart, and compassion feels enlarged as it was by those who  knew and worked with Lincoln in his day. The departing of my dear friend this morning, as I concluded this work, offered no sweet sorrow, but sorrow alone as I am in an age where I have met no Lincoln.

B002YICN74|5.0|It is sooooo clear after listening to this nugget that the ridiculous talent of Nick Jonas was held back by the Disney star machine. Much like Randy Jackson was the driving force behind the Jackson five and Gary Fencik was the cog that made the Chicago Bears Shufflin Crew run, Nick is the true star. He really gets to shine on this release. He is surrounded by other great artists in what becomes a hootenanny of musical genius.     How ironic that a guy that played drums for Rob Thomas would have the last name Bland?    This thing is very similiar to Ronnie James Dio's early work in that it takes music, kicks it in the Jimmy and sends it to it's room. It's a rockin vibe from a rockin guy. Nick Jonas has the guts to lay out Conspiracy Theories, but still have a song called Stronger. One would assume that it's a cover of the Britney Spears anthem \\"Stronger\\", but it's totally not. It's a different song! Take that Disney says Nick Jonas. He's out of control! He also has a song called \\"in the end\\". Is it a cover of the Linkin Park song? No Way! He does his own song with that title too. Can you stop this kid with a poorly built fence? Heck no you can't!! He's coming at you like a bulldozer with a microphone!! Get the heck out of his way, it's Nick Jonas!! His brothers are terrified of him now as he has morphed into an uncontrollable super monster truck of musical craziness. He's like Bigfoot without all of the hair.     Don't try to stop this release, it's the best album I've heard this year!!!

0553382152|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book, however, when I read for a while, I found it a chore to finish it.  Then I read how the Author is a hypnotherapist, which explained why I had trouble reading it.  I would not have bought the book if I'd known this.
074325144X|5.0|I like this book.  The author did a good job explaining the relation between chi and the physical format of the body in running.  It teaches you how to sense your posture and apply gravity to move you forward.  Implementing chirunning principals, now I can run longer, faster, and injury free.  I love this style.
030745455X|2.0|The story took too long to get going (over 150 pages) which is much too long for any book. It was a slow moving, plodding account of what could have been a good premise. And then, suddenly it is over. One did not care for the characters so one did not become engrossed. I will not get into any of the story as everyone else has done that in their reviews, but none of the characters were fleshed out.<br />I have been unable to finish but three books in my life and this one was close to becoming number four.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|Once again Michael Moore has made another truly amazing documentary.  The movie isn't about politics, but about the corruption in our economy and how fat cats just keep finding ways to fatten their wallets while others are forced to be the bag holders.  This film is highly recommended.

B002VPE1B6|1.0|I fell for it... but they aren't gonna get me twice.  I was excited to get the movie so I pre-ordered it well over a month ago expecting it to be like most blu-ray releases (special features, etc...).  Obviously I was wrong.  They aren't gonna get me a 2nd time though... I'm not gonna re-purchase it when they try and rape my wallet with a new release with special features.  I should have just waited (like you all should).  Don't fall for the double-dipping that these studios are doing now... let 'em know you won't stand for it!  I sure won't!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|For $20, it's not a bad price for two DVD's. Even without the special features, you got one heck of a deal. It's beats not spending $25 or more on the same DVD combo if you were to buy it from Walmart, Target or Best Buy. For Amazon, that's not a bad price.
B002VECM72|4.0|This is a really good movie for Sandra Bullock fans and my wife likes it, too.  Finding a movie that we both can enjoy is unusual.  I generally like something with a high body count or more aliens (of the outer space kind) and she actually makes me fast-forward over the scenes in \\"The Blind Side\\" were Michael goes to visit his old neighborhood associates and they get to shooting at one another.  Actually that part of the story could have been left out entirely.  We know that Michael comes from a neighborhood with gangs and poverty.  No need to demonstrate it.  \\"Gangland\\" on TV is a waste of bandwidth and has no social value either for that matter.  Instead of blocking the faces, those criminals should be arrested on the spot.    Anyway, \\"The Blind Side\\" is a great movie and well worth the price to see Sandra in her Oscar winning role, especially when it is a true story.    One problem with pre-ordering a movie on Amazon, however.  You don't actually save any money and the movie is in the stores three days before your order hits your mailbox.  If pre-ordering got you the movie a week before it was at the stores, that would be worth the trouble.  Now if my \\"Avatar\\" would only show up.
B002X6DQV4|5.0|Very good product. I use it to charge my cell phone while riding my motorcycle.
B0035V35P8|4.0|If I remember well, all fight sequences in Bruce Lee films were well lighted. There was a good reason for this, as Bruce was aware that his audience wanted to see his techniques. Also, when Bruce directed a movie, he avoided what director Robert Clouse did in \\"Enter the Dragon,\\" namely film many of the fights in close-up. Good lighting and full view of the fights were the brand of a Bruce Lee movie.    \\"Ninja Assassin\\" was filmed in the dark. Therefore the best action scenes go unnoticed. I can't possible imagine what could motivate filmmakers to commit such an atrocity. This movie is probably one of the best ever made, unfortunately ruined by poor lighting. Too bad.
0385504225|4.0|The Lost Symbol delivers and is not disappointing or a let down after The DaVinci Code and Angel's.  Dan Brown does the research for you.  It's an \\"everything you wanted to know about DC Symbology but didn't know who to ask\\".  The plot is believeable and plausible, the villian is one of the cruelest and genuine black heart's, as I've seen.  There is just the right amount of tension in the story to keep it a page turner.  I am confused about the placement of Director Inoue Sato of the Office of Security.  Her antics are not believable, just brass and crude. I haven't finished reading the book so maybe Sato's story will come together later. I would enjoy seeing how Brown understands the pending appocalpse of 2012.  Any plans to visit Mexico?

It seems like those giving bad reviews for this care more about extra features then the actual movie and quality. Personally I could careless about dvd/blu-ray extras. I rarely ever mess with them. But seeing as this movie is almost 3 hours long, looks great and you get a dvd copy with it, then its worth the $20.     Movie it-self:     This is the first time I seen it. Did not watch it in theaters or in 3D so I waited for the blu-ray release. Though the whole story and movie itself I think was a little over rated being as its a simple, known story that is every where dont in a simple way, it still was done well. Its very unoriginal and preachy but anyone with common sense or isn't heartless would agree with the message that everyone already knows.     3 out of 5    Picture quality:    This is where the movie shines. This easily the best picture quality on blu-ray yet. Crisp, clean, vibrant. Think of the Imax scenes from The Dark Knight and how good they looked. Avatar is the Imax version throughout the while film but looks even better. This is mainly due to most of the movie being computer generated images thus the clean and vibrant look. This is the movie you use to show off your High def entertainment system. The picture and sound quality alone warrants the purchase. Most people will be amazed by the quality.    6 out 5    Sound Quality:    To most the sound quality will seem like its just as good as many other movies on blu-ray but if you have a good quality sound system, you'll be immersed in the environment sounds and the chanting. The battle scenes rival that of other big action movies without over using the sub woofer. The only bad part is some of the in door dialogue sounds either echos really bad to where it sounds like their are repeating themselves making it hard to understand certain things they sayor the opposite where in some scenes the voices sound muffled. Out door dialogue is great though.     4.7 out 5    Extras :    true there is no real extras but you do get a dvd copy of the movie with it. While stores are selling the dvd version for near $20 or more, you're getting both the blu-ray and dvd version for that price. As I stated earlier, I don't really care about dvd/blu-ray extras since I find most of them to be boring and pointless unless you care about how movies are made.    3 out of 5

B002E2M5IC|3.0|\\"A Serious Man\\"  is an original.  Directed by Joel and Ethan Coen (\\"No Country for Old Men\\"), the film focuses on an Everyman named Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg), a physics professor at a Midwestern university where he will soon learn if he will receive tenure.  The year is 1967, and Larry is in for some unexpected troubles.  His wife (Sari Lennick) is leaving him for best friend Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed).   His unemployed brother (Richard Kind) is becoming more and more of a burden.  His son, Danny (Aaron Wolff), is secretly listening to rock music at Hebrew school rather than learning the Torah.  The alluring woman next door sunbathes nude.  Larry elicits sympathy because he is a decent guy bombarded by a series of incidents that lead him to wonder why God has singled him out for \\"tsouris.\\"  Distraught, he consults three different rabbis, who lead him on a convoluted journey as he struggles to make sense of it all.    There are many Coen trademarks here:  emphasis on the grotesque, dry humor, ominous low-angle cinematography, situations bordering on the surreal, and bizarre dream/nightmare sequences.  The Coens tell their story episodically, offering perhaps a few too many tangential subplots.  When we think we've latched onto the main thread, focus shifts, and then shifts again.  The film is like a homemade chicken soup where the individual ingredients haven't quite blended.      Performances are uniformly low-key as characters create comedy in subtle ways.  There are no jokes, but we laugh at the earnest characters, the absurd situations, and the skewering of established religion.  \\"A Serious Man\\" is the anti-sitcom.  It showcases a family with its warts and flaws right out front.  Ozzie and Harriet never worried about the meaning of life or why a dark cloud settled over the family.  The Coens revel in dissecting Larry's angst as we watch his awkward, humorous missteps through life, relationships, and morality.  The ending is rather abrupt, and might requirea replay to understand how everything comes together.    Blu-ray and DVD extras include the featurettes \\"Becoming Serious,\\" which explores the creative vision behind \\"A Serious Man;\\" \\"Creating 1967,\\" a tour of the Minneapolis neighborhoods used in the movie; and \\"Hebrew and Yiddish for Goys,\\" a guide through the mysteries of the Hebrew and Yiddish languages.
0316044938|3.0|This book had great potential to be one of the best books of our time. However, it fell far short with its many lagging parts. I think it could have held the reader in suspense throughout the book, but I kept finding myself getting bored. It was bearable and ok until the end. The end of this book is such a great disappointment in how it just seemed to drop off like the author ran out of ideas. I think the concept of the book was excellent, but the author could not pull it off.
B001B51B9M|5.0|Hollywood is notorious for remaking Broadway hits with \\"more commercial\\" stars and bypassing the stage actors who originated the roles.  Julie Andrews lost \\"My Fair Lady\\" to Audrey Hepburn,  Lucille Ball was chosen over Angela Lansbury for \\"Mame,\\" and Rosalind Russell got the role of Mama Rose in \\"Gypsy\\" instead of powerhouse Ethel Merman.  Occasionally, however, studio executives make intelligent casting choices when adapting a Broadway musical, as in \\"The Music Man.\\"    \\"The Music Man\\" stars Robert Preston, from the original Broadway production, as con man Harold Hill.  \\"Professor\\" Hill sweeps into River City, Iowa, to form a boys' band, to the disapproval and later delight of the town librarian, Marian (Shirley Jones).  Preston created his signature role of the charming stranger who stirs up a sleepy town.  He transforms town skeptics into enthusiastic cheerleaders when he talk/sings \\"Ya Got Trouble,\\" noting the evils of ragtime, slang, and young men frittering away their time playing pool.      Composer Meredith Willson based \\"The Music Man\\" on his own small-town Midwestern boyhood, around 1912.  The score includes the standards \\"76 Trombones,\\" \\"Till There Was You,\\" \\"My White Night,\\" and \\"Goodnight, My Someone.\\"  The cast includes Buddy Hackett, Hermione Gingold, Paul Ford, and seven-year-old Ronnie Howard, who lisps his way through the tune, \\"Gary, Indiana.\\"    Opening on Broadway during its Golden Age of Musicals, \\"The Music Man\\" is an old-fashioned show, rich with comedy and melody, touching lightly on social commentary.  Preston makes his charlatan charismatic with fast talk, razzmatazz, \\"think system\\" of music education, and ability to make stodgy skeptics believe in the boys band.  Hill is larger than life -- a lovable scoundrel who is ultimately tamed by the lovely spinster Marian.  The movie is an enjoyable record of Preston's fiery, funny interpretation of musical comedy's foremost con man.  Blu-ray extras include a making-of featurette, an introductionby Shirley Jones, and a theatrical trailer.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|If you enjoy the classic version of the film and don't have time to muck around with all the extras, features, commentary, blah blah blah...Then this is the right DVD for you. It is good value for a Blu-ray edition.    Yes yes, we all know there will be an enhanced verion with extra content, 3D (for those of you with 4 pairs of expensive glasses and TVs) and features just in time for the holiday rush. There always is a premium cost involved, so expect a two and or three disc version later at 25-30% premium.    For those of you who *just* want to enjoy the movie the way you paid for it on the big screen, then enjoy the Blu-ray for yourself and lend out disc two, the DVD standard resolution to a friend.    A good movie all-in-all...I agree, not an Oscar award-winner, but worth the watch for you fantasy and sci-fi folks.
B002T9H2LA|4.0|Ok, I thought this would be a great movie, I mean really who does not want to kill Nazis? But this was too graphic and too violent for even a Nazi hater like myself (this was my grandpa's doing because he told me they were bad people, but can you blame him after fighting them in WW2). The acting was really enjoyable, but after some point another killing just becomes boring no matter how graphic is depicted. Pitt was great, as was the German actor. But the mashing of brains was just boring. I mean what can Tarantino do to shock anyone any more? More violence cannot get the job done, so this is a legit question, but this movie proves more is not better. Skip it and do some better with your time.

B002VECMAE|1.0|I do not wish any animal to suffer harm, but goats are tasty when they are dead and smell when they are alive. So a dead goat can have some thing going for it. A dead goat would also avoid the horrid fate of being included in this, the worst movie I have seen. This movie was so slow and not funny that any self-respecting goat would rather be a kabob then be in this. It was simply that bad. It was pointless and just rambled. In addition, the acting was among the worst I have seen from this collection of actors. Skip this movie and retain two hours of your life you could never get back if you watched this awful movie.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Just ordered my copy of the best movie of all time. I saw this multiple times in the theater and loved it each and every time. I'll be getting the expanded edition when it comes out, but there is no way I'm waiting until then to watch this magical film again. Thank you James Cameron for creating this masterpiece.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I saw this film on a whim and am very glad I did.  I hadn't read anything about Victoria before and knew nothing of her early life.  This film seems to capture the basic outlines in a responsible and dramatically interesting fashion.  The costumes, acting, etc are excellent.  The script is fine.  Some liberties were taken with history for dramatic effect.  For example, Lord Melbourne is played as someone in his 30s, when in fact he was in his late 50s when Victoria became queen.  There is a strong dramatic element of implied sexual competition between Melbourne and the king that I suspect was absent in real life.  No real disappointments here.  If you think you may like it, you won't be disappointed.
B002A9OJ0Q|2.0|[[ASIN:B002A9OJ0Q Foot of the Mountain]]  Because of being A-Ha one of my favorite bands of the 80s and the 5 stars reviews I bought this album without listening to it. And I don't like it, I try and try and try but I still don't like it. I have not done a very deep analysis of the songs; the music I was expecting from the guys is not there.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|My 3 year old daughter could literally watch this movie all day! It's funny and teaches a good lesson about \\"it don't matter what you look like\\"! One note of caution, the shadow people can be kind of scary but we told our daughter that they were just mean people dressed in costumes and she wasn't afraid of them anymore.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Since I am not a big fan of kids' movies and I don't have kids around, I skipped over Monsters, Inc. when it came out on cable. One evening there was nothing else to watch so I picked this for background noise. After a few minutes I found myself watching the movie and laughing. This has to be one of the best animated features out there. Monsters, Inc. boasts a stellar cast:  John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, Jennifer Tilly, and James Coburn! Imagine that kind of talent creating the  monsters' personalities, woven together by an extremely clever story line, brought to life by award winning animation and you get a film that you can watch again and again.  It is funny, touching, and a great reason to bring your friends together for movie night. This is one tickles the inner child in us all.
B002T9H2LK|5.0|The story begins in Nazi-occupied France, early in the war.  SS-Standartenfuhrer Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) arrives at an isolated dairy farm in the French countryside to very thoroughly do his job of hunting Jews.  (He has, thus far, done his job so well that he has earned the nickname \\"The Jew Hunter\\"; he considers it a term of endearment, mentally counting the numbers who know him.)  Landa, in his cunning, skillful thinking he so prides himself in possessing suspects that the French landowner is sheltering Jews on his premises.  Actually, after a point, Landa considers himself, quite obviously and arrogantly, to know because, as he says, he thinks like those he hunts.  What a good Nazi he is!        The slow buildup of tension in the above scene is so perfect that I cannot imagine it being done better.  In just twenty minutes of mostly dialogue alone, Tarantino is able to build a sense of nail-biting suspense that few other directors could do after loads of superficial, frenetic action so typical in Hollywood.  (Christoph Waltz certainly deserves the Oscar he received for his performance as the SS officer, just within those first twenty minutes.)  To back up a bit, the tension begins as a car slowly winds its way up a country road toward its destination.  We know, as well as the landowner, that something bad is about to happen, not because we know the SS is coming, but because of the look and behavior of the landowner and his family.  It's real, it's developed, and nothing is left up to mere stereotypes.  (You would feel the dread, even if you knew nothing of the SS.)  SS-Standartenfuhrer Landa begins his visit to the French landowner very cordially and politely, speaking the most perfect French, and rivaling the most cultured aristocrat in his demeanor.  However, it's a thin façade that wears away, with calculation and charm, ending in a perfect boldness of wit and cruel sarcasm.  (In other words, he's actually a perfect Nazi!)  There's a scene with a pipe that places humor, most effectively, at a most ironic time, somehow making the suspense all the more suspenseful, after the laughing stops.  You'll know what I mean when you see it.  The pipe really can't be missed.    After a bloodbath at the dairy farm, a young Jewish woman named Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent) flees into the woods, thus ending Chapter One.  Shosanna forges a new life for herself in occupied Paris, and, of course, dispenses some much-deserved revenge in a later chapter.  Speaking of chapters, that's how this movie tells its story.  As one chapter ends, there is a black screen which neatly informs us of the next chapter beginning.  What a novel idea!    Chapter Two introduces us to \\"The Basterds\\" led by Brad Pitt, as Lt. Aldo Raine.  They are a group of ten men seriously set on killing \\"Nazis\\" (the a being pronounced as a short vowel, as in cat) Yes, Lt. Aldo Raine speaks with a strong Tennessee accent and battle-hardened slang, making an effective caricature of himself throughout the movie.  He tells his group of assassins that he expects no less than \\"100 Nazi scalps\\" from everyone, and he means it!  With the exception of Lt. Raine, the rest of the Basterds are Jewish, making all the revenge, regardless of how violent, all the more appropriate.  In order to exact their revenge and do their part in the war, the Basterds are parachuted behind enemy lines, surrounded by numerous, soon-to-be hairless \\"Natzi\\" victims.  Let's also say that the camera never shies away from scenes of basterd revenge.  So be prepared, since, as they say, \\"A basterd's work is never done!\\"      In the following chapters (I think there are six in all), everyone links up, sooner or later, whether they know it or not, for a first or second time, with suspenseful déjà-vu where appropriate.  (You don't want the people who tried to kill you earlier to recognize you later!)  What's also powerful is how Tarantino makes each of the characters in the film a perfect icon of whom orwhat they represent--again, Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine, the quintessential hero, and Christoph Waltz as the arch-nemesis Nazi.  Tarantino also does this most efficiently with the sultry, sexy heroine (Melanie Laurent) and a smoldering French actress/femme fatale (Diane Kruger).  The camera loves these women, and Tarantino gives us all the reasons to know why.  The lens glides over their curves, from one scene to the next, no matter how tense the moment, teasing the viewer with only just the right amount of information.              I could go on and on with this, but if I did I'd tell too much of a story that's better off seen than read about.  Other stars include the usual suspects--Hermann Goering, Joseph Goebbels, Martin Bormann, and yes, Adolf Hitler himself!  (If the real Hitler hadn't already done so well making a caricature of himself, I'd give the actor an Oscar for doing it for him.)  One great thing about this movie is that it rather faux-seriously depicts an alternate ending to the war unlike anything you might otherwise imagine.  So, in other words, the ending is not predictably as it really was, from what we already know, as is the case with most other such movies.  (As exciting and excellent as Valkyrie was, we already knew how it would end.)  The finale of Inglourious Basterds gives a much deserved comeuppance to everyone exactly as we all wish they had received it.  It's nearly over-the-top but believable retribution and overkill (literally) at Tarantino's finest!  Another great thing about Basterds lies in Tarantino's ability to push things as far as possible, without going over the edge of realism.  As over-the-top as it nearly gets at times, we never really think it couldn't have actually happened.        This is a war movie that isn't really about war.  It's a Nazi movie that's more about anti-Nazism than it is about anti-Semitism.  Depending on how sensitive you are, there are numerous things which could be offensive.  There is death, murder,war, torture, execution, copious amounts of blood, violence, and even a final fatally-attracted, autograph-singing German war hero/sniper.  Oh yes!  Did I mention that there is real humor, as well?  (Wait till you see the three basterds incognito as non-Italian-speaking Italian film critics!)  Of course, this is a Tarantino film!  What do you expect?      Again, as for the offensive things in this movie, relax.  They are really no more offensive than anything else you've seen before about a group of inglourious Nazi-scalping basterds who, more than coincidentally, happen to be Jewish.  So, set aside your hang-ups, morals, ethics, political correctness, and overblown virtues for a couple of hours, at least, and enjoy the story that never was, about a group of basterds that never were.  If you're like me, you'll even happily feel like a basterd in the end.

1400079276|4.0|One of the reasons many fans of science fiction favor Star Wars over Star Trek is the overt spirituality found in the story.  There is the force, which holds a mysterious presence over all the jedi do, and manages to hold the audience in rapture as its sages explain its workings.  Obi Wan teaches Luke how to use a light saber, and as an example of the force, tells him to lower the blast shield so he can't see his opponent and must feel his way in the fight.<br /><br />Since humanity began telling stories, the world of fairies, genii, gods, and otherworldly heroes have walked with us to impress and leave in their wake mystery and awe over what they take for granted as everyday life.  I've found that in South American and Asian literature the world of fairies and creatures we can only imagine what strange creatures the characters describes are, and amazingly show themselves in stories that would otherwise seem ordinary.  Visions of the future in dreams, visits from dead relatives, crossing the boundary between the living and the dead, all are examples these authors seem comfortable telling.  This is one of them.<br /><br />Murakami tells the story of Kafka, the fifteen year old who never knew his sister or mother and despises his father, forcing him to leave home with a hefty bit of cash and go in search of something he couldn't identify at the time.  He goes to an anonymous town, meets a girl a few years older than himself, has a sexual encounter with her, and leaves to find himself living at a library owned by an older mysterious woman he is later attracted to.  The story is charged with human sexuality and in places becomes nearly gratuitous in the description of what happens.<br />If it sounds a lot like the story of Oedipus, then you are right.  It is the story of Oedipus told in modern day Japan with an overlay of Japanese culture and a fluid transition between what is real and unreal, life and death, and what is natural and supernatural.  Like much of the animation coming from Japan, two worlds mix and the reader floats back and forth until  each is indistinguishable.  Anime seems obsessed with the relationship of the spiritual world to the digital one and how they two relate to each other in a way that can make sense with what came before.<br /><br />What Murakami does well is his telling of the world of spirits where time stops and people are at the mercy of those who are familiar with the otherwise unfamiliar.  He incorporates mystery into his story where it is obvious that a door to another world has been opened, and all the reader can do is stand and wonder along with the characters.  The explanations of this other world are lacking, which works in the story to make it even more appealing and interesting.  The story moves nicely, and each chapter ends with the reader wanting to know what happens next.  Wonderful pairings occur.  One is reminiscent of  the pair in the movie \\"Rainman\\" where one is dependent on the other to survive in the world and seems to belong to another place, yet has so much to teach the person who seems wise to all around.  Characters are strong and vivid in the story, and when they meet it is a task to imagine what the two would say to one another.<br /><br />The story, however, lacks in contrast to what happens with Kafka and conclusions the story comes to in the end.  The dialogue in the more dramatic parts is overly sentimental and predictable, which doesn't fit well with the wonderfully vivid and interesting descriptions of what happens to its characters.<br /><br />Overall, it is a compelling read with interesting characters that are easily known.  Certain conversations serve as an entrance to the mysterious world created, while others seem to serve as filler where characters can't seem to transcend the ordinariness of everyday interaction.  He does well with showing the extraordinary in the extraordinary, but the extraordinary in the ordinary is still a mystery.rom Japan, two worlds mix and the reader floats back and forth until  each is indistinguishable.

B0036XN2L2|5.0|I've been a Scorpions fan since the 1970's. Their music has always been amazing and finally by the mid 80's when \\"hair metal\\" was big, so were the Scorpions. They've given us touching ballads as well as hard rockin songs.  This is their last album as they will retire after their final world tour. This album is as good as all their albums. They've stuck with the same formula and it works! I love this cd. It has a mixture of beautiful ballads and rockin rock songs.  I hope that the Scorpions make a stop in Dallas, because that would be the icing on the cake for me.  If you're a Scorpions fan I highly recommend this cd for you. It's an amazing tribute to why they've been around for so long.
B003A6C67G|5.0|Its about time this great CD has come out remastered and in deluxe edition.It really is a shame that THAT lineup didnt keep going.I mean John Sykes is a KILLER guitarist and very under rated.Not to mention Ansley Dunbar on drums.By the time this CD caught on and really took off and became a monster hit, we see this big hair metal band and two guitarist trying to take Sykes place. I heard that getting Sykes and Coverdale back together would have been a big coup for John Kolodner, but sadly its never happened.I dont see it happening, because God love 'em, they both have big egos.I have several of Sykes' Cds, that you can seem to only be able to pick up as imports, and he plays alot of this Cd in his shows.If you have never listened to or purchaced this CD back in the day, than this would be the perfect time to get it in this deluxe edition....CRANK IT!!!
0446563048|4.0|When Tim Ferriss recommended this book on his video podcast, I knew I had to read it. Everyone in marketing talks about Zappo's like they are the gods of customer service, setting all of us poor schmucks up for failure if we try to replicate the over-the-top great service Zappo's provides (I certainly don't want my landscaping clients calling me at 3AM asking the number for a pizza delivery service!)<br /><br />So I was keen to get an inside look into the mind behind the legendary Zappo's, and it was a fun read! Tony is an engaging writer and has a self-deprecating sense of humor that makes you feel like you're friends with him (if you were friends with billionaires who went to Harvard).<br /><br />The problem was that I was hoping for a book that would provide insights into my own small landscaping business. Many books that discuss larger businesses give good information that is useful to every business owner. This book, by contrast, might provide some buried gems to people in a larger business, but as a landscaper with two employees, I wasn't able to extract anything useful from my time with this book. I enjoyed it, yes - but if I am going to read a book merely for enjoyment, it probably wouldn't be a business book.<br /><br />That said, it's an interesting look into the mind of an amusing and personable businessman, and if you enjoy that kind of reading or have a special interest in Zappo's, you'll probably enjoy it a lot. It's a fun read, but it's more about Tony and Zappo's than about what they can teach us.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|This is BY FAR the best looking and sounding blu ray disc I have ever seen.      PICTURE QUALITY  The picture quality is beyond description and is so clear that it is like looking through a window.  The colors are vibrant beyond belief.  Every detail of every image is sharp and exquisite.  I've never seen anything like it for a home theatre system before. The image had more detail than I noticed during the 3D presentation I saw in the theatre and the colors were even more vivid.  Many scenes on this disc look as though they are in 3D, there is that much depth to the images.  I'm beyond words to describe how incredible this disc looks.     AUDIO QUALITY  For english language this disc offers DTS 5.1 HD audio and DOLBY 5.1.  I listened to the DTS. The sound is equal to the image.  Every speaker in your system will be busy with this one.  Rear speakers are in constant use with all sorts of immersive sound effects and the subwoofer will shake your house.  This is spectacular entertainment and unprecedented in home video history.    PACKAGE AND FUNCTIONALITY  The 2 disc set comes in a striking reflective slip case.  The discs are housed in a standard sized two disc keep case with the left side containing the DVD and the right side holding the blu ray disc.  The disc menus are gorgeous and very easy to navigate.  Pop up menu is quick and easy to read.  There are NO FORCED TRAILERS or advertisements before the menu pops up but there are the usual warning screens.  Although my player is usually fast loading, this disc took a bit more time to load than most (about one minute).      EXTRAS  There are none unless you count the DVD as an extra.  There are however two inserts.  One is a $25 off certificate toward the purchase of a Panasonic Blu ray player.  The other insert contains an access code to the website which allows you to watch bonus material/sneek preview stuff.    FINAL THOUGHTS  It isn't expensive. It is well worth the money (at least to me) as I found it to be themost impressive home video release (in terms of picture and sound quality) that I have ever seen.  Buy it!

I could care less about 3D, but I do think it is generally predatory to the consumer to not offer both options initially at the same time. I mean, its not like the version released today is all of the sudden going to be $10 when the \\"ultimate\\" edition comes out. I would venture to say, that come November, the DVD/Blu-Ray combo will still be somewhere around $30 (as per normal pricing for a new release combo pack) and the \\"ultimate\\" edition will be around $40-50 (also a combo pack i hope, and loaded with special features much like the aforementioned LOTR Special Extended Edition DVDs). If that is the case, I'll gladly fork over the couple extra bucks for the \\"ultimate\\" edition, but that by no means states that I endorse the sales practices of Mr. Cameron and FOX in any manner.    Frankly, I'll buy the movie in November, when some retailer is practically giving the movie away during the peak of holiday shopping season.
140191716X|5.0|I have read many of Doreen Virtue books and all are inspiring, but this book, the gift edition is stunning!  It is very uplifting and would make a perfect gift for anyone who believes in Angels or who is a Doreen Virtue fan.  Buy it for yourself, too!
B000SMWUPS|4.0|This is a holder that works well. It adjusts to the weight of the cup well so there is no spilling when putting in fountain drinks. It stays put well also with the velcro straps. Pleased with the product and would reccomend.
0618918248|5.0|This is a great book that scientifically explains the improbability of a god.  This book will only \\"work\\" for people who are able to understand the science he uses, though.<br /><br />I noticed the editorial review from Publishers Weekly is blatantly biased against atheism.<br />Blatantly biased reviews should be provided by the individual people, not Amazon, in my opinion.

B0039UTDFG|1.0|While neither version have been released yet David Attenborough did a superb job on Planet Earth and numerous other productions. Without hesitation I will be buying the David Attenborough version. The numbers will tell the truth...just watch the sales position of both versions when they are released on June1, 2010.
1400052173|5.0|I recommend this book as a good read and for fascinating new facts.  It was well researched and very well written.  Amazing the new things there are to learn about ordinary subjects.
B001CTDH76|5.0|Love it! This is such a different slant on the \\"cops\\" themed series - it is so lighthearted and Simon Baker makes his character both likeable and annoying at the same time. I find it a really refreshing change to the intensity of shows like CSI and Law and Order (both of which I also enjoy) I look forward to the next series    Pam conrads
B00127RAJY|5.0|I think this is a fantastic exercise exercise video! The only exercise I have done previous to this is walking 4-6 miles a day. But I wanted to do more without joining a gym, so I bought this video. I am 64 years old and the exercises are definitely challenging, but not too hard for me. It's only 20 to 30 minutes long and in 2-3 weeks doing it every other day, I lost my big stomach! Fantastic results. If an exercise hurts or is too difficult for me, I tone it down slightly. But for the most part I try to do everything she says. Otherwise it wouldn't be effective. I highly recommend it. Just use common sense and listen to what she says. Jillian knows what she's talking about.\\"
1416550550|4.0|This book was definitely hard to put down. I was hooked by the story and I was eager to solve the mystery of Nell. The jumps in time were not confusing and seemed to lead to answer in an unconventional and surprisingly direct manner. I could recommend this book to anyone. Enjoy.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Some American readers have complained about the rather detailed introduction that involves Swedish law. But I find international stories to be compelling. In addition, Larson's crime drama/thriller has been criticized for its level of violence. I have to say, if your stomach is too weak for some violence and blood (don't forget, this is a book!), then by all means, find a more gentle harbor!<br /><br />However, if you enjoy intelligent, engrossing novels by a master storyteller, then \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" is for you!<br /><br />Of course, you don't need me to tell you this. Just look at the success of the book, and the movie. Clearly, millions enjoyed it.<br /><br />Recommended.
0375831002|5.0|This book is written in the most expressive manner.  According to the publisher it is for young adults, but it keeps any reader attentive from the start.  It is written by death but don't let that scare you, this only makes the story richer.  Although the main character is just ten or eleven years old, the characters of all ages are so warmly depicted you feel drawn to them, especially to a young Jewish man caught in the Nazi web. The action takes place during World War II just outside of Munich,Germany giving the reader a totally different perspective of history. Although the book is 400 pages or more, I didn't want to see the end coming up.
B0030DHPGQ|4.0|I liked the book.  I thought the selection of the rider, elephant, and path were a little goofy; however, somewhat effective to get Heath's point across.    Change and change management are hard stuff.  I've yet to run across someone that has the silver bullet.  So, if you are looking for a silver bullet, this is not it.  But, it is a good one to have in your bag of tricks.      One approach to discussing change is to focus on the mechanics.  You need a plan like this, you need to communicate this, you need to plot this, etc.  You get the drift.  It is tool focused and creates a story that if you follow the methodology and tools, then success is imminent.  Which there are no pied pipers of change that have a magical flute, so we know that is not the full story.    Heath goes the other direction and really focuses on the human side of change which is the hardest and most variable.  This is where I think it has a place in the bag of tricks.  It is easy to get focused on tools and methodology and ignore the people.  Heath lays out a plan to guide you to focusing on the people and is less on using specific tools.  While he does provide some guidelines, they are far from tools that you will find in other change management books.    Bottomline:  Worth the read?  Yes.  Worth a place in the library?  Yes.  A silver bullet?  No.
1416572287|5.0|The author of this book teaches physics at the college level. He tries to make some arcane topics approachable through the humorous touch of presenting ideas to his dog, Emma. I really enjoyed Emma's interview when she was first adopted: I an just imagine a black lab interrogating a future owner. I also enjoyed the numor when Emma says, \\"Getting rid of cats is a good idea\\" and the idea of multiplying treats.<br /><br />However, make no mistake. This book may be light-hearted but it's not light. I continue to re-read the chapters very slowly. It's not quite like studying from a text, but you do have to pay attention as you read. I found it helpful to take notes.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone who wants to learn physics painlessly, with the caveat that you do have to invest some effort in understanding. However, the author does make the material more accessible than just about every other book I've read (or tried to read) on the subject. He does a particularly good job of discussing the disconnect between the quantum world and the visible world.
B002MUAJ2A|2.0|I picked this up on a whim based on a high ranking in sales and in rating.  Before picking this up, I just finished Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion.  Here's how the two tie together.    I committed the folly of social proof (explained in Influence) to come to the conclusion that this would be worth my $9.99.  Which means that if the sales are high and the ratings are high, then it must be good.  By taking this shortcut, I increased the wealth of Jason Fried, but don't think I really got much from it.  Yea for Jason!    This book would be like going to a comedy club expecting to hear a comedian that is a good story teller and the guy gets on stage and zips one-liners all night.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  All I know is that there are a couple of hours gone that I won't get back.  Oh wait, that was one of Mr. Fried's points.  If there is something else more productive that you could be doing, then you should do that.  On that note, my take is that there is something more productive that you could do with your time than plow through this.    And to bring it back to Influence, Mr. Cialdini says the best defense to being lured into something by a weapon of influence, you should sound the alarm so others know.  Ougah!  Ougah!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|It is an awesome TV series.  I have given both the first and second season to my teen age grandchildren, they talk about it all the time and never miss the show on TV.  Problem is they have doubled the price for season three!!!  If you have recorder record it because when a show get good they raise the prices.  Cost the same to produce but how can the big CEO's get larger raises if they don't charge us for the real good stuff!
B001KOFH2G|5.0|this movie was very enjoyable, particularly on blu ray. The picture and sound are excellent. I had never seen an episode of firefly or even heard of it for that matter, but this movie made me a fan. Strongly recommend it.
B000002ARV|4.0|When I started delving into Johnny's back catalog, this was the record which found itself on my turntable more than any other. Johnny's not frequently a songwriter, so maybe it helped that he filled it up with other people's songs -- it makes for great variety, and (typical of Johnny) he does most of it pretty well. \\"Silver Train\\" was reportedly written for him anyway, and \\"Ain't Nothing to Me\\" sounds so unlike his usual output that I wondered if it was even him singing.<br /><br />But that's getting ahead: \\"Rock Me Baby\\" features the most kick-ass JW guitar solo I can recall and I've heard 'em all: it's like taking \\"Fast Life Rider\\" and reducing it to two blues choruses. Really, it's hard to take anyone else's version seriously after hearing this one, so that's just about worth the buying price alone. From the first song, Johnny's given us notice. You can complain about quantity, but the quality's there if you're up to hearing it. \\"Still Alive And Well\\" is a powerhouse bluesy rocker, as is \\"Can You Feel It\\" -- if a few of the others sound a little like typical early 70s rock music, well -- they are: Johnny was the biggest influence going on bluesy rock trios, and this was smack in the midst of it. Spin this, and you're hearing it right where it's at.<br /><br />The main issue: is it a good record, one you'd listen to over and over? Well, I already did, so there ya go. Now it's your turn, so go ahead -- you won't be sorry. Oh yeah: the bonus tracks are OK too. :)
0792843584|5.0|This is without doubt the best movie I have ever seen, and I have seen them all. I would rate this as better than Gone With The Wind. JT

B001J1O83E|5.0|This film holds a level of excellence that is all too frequently absent in current action movies.  However, what's up with someone selling it on here for TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS??  Good.  God.  That's just plain stupid.
B002I9Z8DK|5.0|I'm a Sci Fi geek.  I've seen nearly all of what Star Trek has to offer.  Some of it great, and some of it is hard to watch.  Star Trek: the Undiscovered Country is the best piece of ST story, even considering Wrath of Khan.  This is of course my opinion, and I know lots of fans will disagree with me.  But this movie (ST:tUC) is far more engrossing for me.  The set up, the character interactions, and the wonderful commentaries that apply to normal life... I just got more out of this movie than I did any other star trek story.  Though I will admit, I love Wrath of Khan, and there are a lot of next generation episodes that really make you think.  I guess I'm trying to say that I don't make this review lightly.  There's a lot of Star Trek I love.  This one is just at the top of my list.<br /><br />One last thing... even if you're not a fan of Sci Fi, and you don't know much about Star Trek, this movie may very likely be worth watching.  The important stuff in the movie doesn't depend on the Sci Fi... it's just a vehicle for conveying the excellent story.

B002VPE1AW|1.0|it is greatly appreciated that the reviewers share so much with us; i definitely will NOT purchase this barebones release, but will wait until the one with the special features we are supposed to get with these release is available later in the year.
B001EOQWEO|4.0|This film is really two films.  The first half of the film has our beloved Wall E stranded on a planet, trying desperately to clean up the planet.  Then a spaceship arrives, and Wall E falls in love with a female robot.  He then becomes a stowaway on their ship, and arrives in a world with lots (and lots) of lazy, overweight humans.<br /><br />The first half of this film is astonishing.  It's told mostly through visuals, and the little dialogue is \\"robot\\" talk.  As usual with Pixar, it's amazing to look at.  And you feel the vast and empty wasteland that Wall E is having to deal with.  The addition of the female robot is sweet and touching.  I was totally mesmerized during the first half.  Unfortunately, the 2nd half of the film is preachy with its usual \\"humans are stupid and killing the planet\\" theme that's been done a lot and it's really done here in an obvious, ponderous, heavy handed way.  We see a ship with humans who are indulging in overeating, no exercise, watching bad TV shows, etc., etc..  It's a rather obvious metaphor for current humans.  It doesn't completely ruin the film, but the 2nd half should have been better.  Its \\"message\\" is so heavy handed you feel at times like you're being lectured to.  The animation is still great, though, but we've come to expect that from Pixar.<br /><br />Wall E is still worth seeing for its phenomenal first half and the astonishing visuals througout the film.
031606792X|2.0|I really enjoy the basic story but I had to skip a lot of it because I got bored and frustrated with the descriptions and thoughts.  Every single boring thought is listed and then repeated when questions were asked.  Also \\"Ice cold stone\\" doesn't sound attractive and everytime Edward touched Bella, it wasn't simply a touch, it had to be descriptive.      I think I would enjoyed the series so much more if it was less wordy.  I am so glad that the movies cut out so much of the descriptions and thoughts out of the screenplay.
B002436WFI|5.0|This was a great movie adaptation from the discworld book series. The Choice of actors was spot on and followed the books very well. Can't say that most of the time.  looking forward to seeing more of them done.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I decided to purchase this headset after watching the product video and reading the reviews.  I haven't had very good luck with headsets in the past, so I was hoping that this wasn't a $80 mistake.    Setup is a snap.  I am using this with my PS3, and I had them up and working within a minute.    The cable is nice and long.  I was worried that cable might be short and the weight of the cable would be pulling on the headset.  I sit about 8ft from my tv/ps3 and there's plenty of slack.    The sound is awesome.  I have a nice set of Bose surround sound speakers set up with my receiver, but after 10pm, I need to turn down the volume of the surround sound because the base alone would keep my wife awake.  With this headset, you can have your surround sound without waking the neighbors.  The separate volume control for chat and game play is very nice.    I do not hear the hissing that other people wrote about, but I didn't try to listen for it.  So it wasn't obvious if it was present.    Con:  I wish the mute button was a push button mute.  With a wife and dogs, I am pretty sure my teammates don't want to hear the old lady yelling at me because I am playing too long.  This is my only problem with the headset, which isn't that big of a deal.

B000026FJ6|3.0|Ok this Modern and \\"New Age\\" version of \\"Tubular Bells\\" represented a kind of compromise- being obviously not equal to his most famous jewel, but it was so pleasant after all!!   Well actually it could have been his first occasion to \\"update\\" the style of his album \\"Incantations\\" for instance (in a sort of \\"minimalist-format\\" but with symphonic elements inside); instead Mike Oldfield kept on using the style of the \\"New Age music\\", which could have been also more commercial in comparison to his old works, so the Discographic Label of course preferred this latter choice, above all for the sale reports...but coming back to the present \\"The songs...\\", it was in the vein of his previous \\"Space\\" and \\"New Age\\" works, in the most polished manner, but without the versatility of \\"Ommadawn\\" for example (otherwise this latter lacking of the quality compositions which characterized his early albums) as well as his cleverness in the use of the electronic effects, like within the modern \\"AMAROK\\"...nevertheless you can find a lot of simple music phrases, floating everything away, both the listener and the soft (but never suspenseful) guitar textures too, which made \\"The songs of Distant Earth\\" closer to the normal listener and a bit distant from the intelligent crossover prog genre, still now!    It's not completely essential, being anyway worth checking out at least, especially for your pretty and sometimes beautiful moments of \\"soul tranquillity\\"...so if you're into this specific sensation, you could either add an half star or definitively refuse it as a boring music product...however, more or less extremist in your music preferences inside the prog world I suppose, make your own choice!!
B00005UW7V|3.0|I don't really need a robot Pinocchio parody to understand or explore human nature. Childhood attachment and imprinting were undoubtedly apparent to most people long before the development of enlightened civilizations with colleges full of social scientists. More specifically, William Hurt's character, Professor Hobby, is poorly drawn. He seems almost robotic himself like his android creations. I also thought that the family dynamics between David (the android), his new parents, and their biological son, Martin, are not played out very well. The abandonment in the forest was meant to be... what exactly... a tear jerker, a case of mixed emotions, or just clunky plot development. Although necessary for the storyline, it comes off as fairly abrupt and rather stiff. Then there's the Flesh Fair, a backlash against androids. It's basically an evangelical demolition variety show for rednecks. This part of the film was probably intended to drive home some of our innate humanity, but it comes off as too contrived and somewhat hokey. The first part of the movie is important because it sets up the second part, but I didn't think it was very good (2 or 3 stars). The philosophical aspects and subtle pairings of real life and its artificial imitations are just ok.<br /><br />The movie really gets going with the trip to Rouge City and subsequently Manhattan. (The movie was released in June 2001, so the Twin Towers are still standing.) David, the robot boy, really is on Pinocchio's quest to be a real boy so that he can receive the genuine love of his adoptive mother. He's accompanied along his journey by Teddy, the supertoy, and Gigolo Joe, a rather savvy android played by Jude Law (there's some 5 star stuff here). First the robot fellowship finds Professor Hobby, David's creator, in his well maintained facility above a partially submerged Manhattan. Here the movie also reveals the unfortunate circumstances behind the creation of David the mecha. Then, just like Pinocchio, David actually finds the Blue Fairy. She's beautiful, but not quite as helpful as he would like. This could have been the end of the movie, but there's another chapter. It's set in the future after the extinction of human beings. A narrator provides the background information, and the story slows down with the arrival of alien anthropologists. In part, they fulfill David's quest, relieve his pain, and, at least for one day, make him abundantly happy. 2,000 years is a long time to be without your mom.nds the Blue Fairy.

After being crushed by her last boyfriend Penny swears off the opposite sex and quietly starts the The Lonely Hearts Club (the name is of course inspired by her fav band)...when other girls notice her new lease on life they decide join too...I mean who needs all the heartache and drama associated with high school dating? Of course fate has other plans for Penny and she meets Ryan....then the school principal threatens to shut down the club when the poor boys in her class find themselves dateless :) Overall a very cute story with a lot of Beatlemania infused through out.

Though this is true when I read it I realized just how good a book it was. I think that Siddhartha's path on his search for Nirvana was very interesting and I was drawn into this book. The way Siddhartha's many challenges, human desires, and obstacles that prevented him from reaching his inner peace are presented made me excited to read more.
159514188X|4.0|Thirteen Reasons Why Book Review    Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher is a novel about Hannah baker, a normal teenage girl who recently committed suicide. Before she dies, Hannah makes audiotapes explaining why she killed herself. There are thirteen reasons and thirteen people to blame for the death of Hannah. All of whom get the audiotapes one after another. The book follows Clay Jensen, who has had a crush on Hannah ever since she has moved to his town several years ago. He gets the audiotapes from Hannah and at first doesn't know what to do. He decides it would be best to listen to them to understand why a girl like Hannah would kill herself. From there the book spirals from place to place while Hannah narrates her story.    When I first heard about this book I thought it had a very interesting idea and I couldn't wait to read it.  I still feel that it is a very unique book and the plot was very good. However I don't really agree with all the reason for Hannah to kill herself. It seemed all the reasons she stated were reasons to get upset but not to kill herself. I understand that all the reasons were to build up to the ultimate decision to kill herself but from an outsiders perspective her decision seemed very rash.   I believe the authors purpose was to show how a story can be told just through words and how alive Hannah felt even though it was just her voice seeing that she was dead.  Like I said it is a very cool concept for the book especially because I could completely visualize everything that Hannah was telling Clay through the tapes and the reader definitely gets a sense of Hannah's personality.  Jay Asher did a really great job and I    can't       wait   to          read        more       from him.                                                                                     Overall I would recommend this book to people of all ages. Being a high school student I feel the book is directed towards teenagers, but I think anyone could enjoy this novel. It really shows a perspective of how those who want to kill themselves feel. Also how such little actions can really affect someone in a way people wouldn't realize. Even though it's not my favorite, Thirteen Reasons Why is a wonderful read.
B00003CX5A|5.0|Johnny Depp is in fine form in this Tim Burton reworking of the classic Sleepy Hollow Fable. Instead of the bumbling country boy Ichabod of the original story Depp plays a bumbling New York City detective sent to investigate the murders taking place in the Hollow. His scientific methods using strange tools and powders of of his own invention are useless in solving the case because as he finally realizes he is dealing with the supernatural in the form of the Headless Horseman played by a very creepy Christopher Walken. Christina Ricci is  beautiful as Katrina Van Tassel and a perfect foil for Depp to play against.The supporting cast is also outstanding making the film a delight to watch.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|Album took a very long time to arrive for a 3-5 day delivery, however, the album rocks! The cd was in great condition as was the case and insert. Thank you. Just... speed that shipping up, that's what took the longest was for the company to actually ship the product after the order. I made a seperate purchase the following week of making this purchase, and recieved that item before I recieved the album. I probably wouldn't say anything except it was a birthday gift that did in fact arrive late, but oh well, no harm done. Thank you.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|The video footage for the series is great, but as many others have added, the narration is TERRIBLE!  I have no idea why we get the versions of this without Attenborough, but I hope they realize the mistake and this is the last series.  Oprah is reading this as if it were for little children, and some of the things she says are just flat out wrong.  I'm not sure if that's on her or Discovery, but either way, wait for the BBC version!
B000XA5K48|4.0|This movie was awesome.  Constant nonstop action.  Very good!! Rented it, loved it and had to have it for my collection.  Could watch it over and over again.

0061122416|1.0|I would give this book NO stars, but that's not a selection. I would never have finished it, except my book club selected it. Actually, I wouldn't have even opened it after reading the book jacket--flowery fables of realizing your dreams are not my cup of tea.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Man, I wish I had been around to see this when it was originally released to theaters.  I was born in 1989, twelve years too late for that.  I had to settle for seeing it in 1997 with new improved special effects.  This movie set the standard for what makes a good Science Fiction movie, and it was, at the time, the first movie in a few years that wasn't depressing and unpleasant to watch (this was the seventies after all).  Everything about this movie was perfect, from the plot (which at the time wasn't generic, we've had so many inferior remakes of this storyline, from Eragon to Legend of the Seeker) to the characters, to the classic alien battle scenes.     The characters were all amazing.  Luke Skywalker is the youthful protagonist who embarks on a quest to become a Jedi Knight and follow in his father's footsteps.  We get to follow the journey Luke makes from boy to man over the course of these three films.    Luke is a very good protagonist because he's not infallible.  He slips up and makes mistakes, even in Return of the Jedi when he's become a lot more mature.  Princess Leia is the quick-witted damsel-in-distress.  Artoo and Threepio provide great comic relief, and Obi-Wan is the wise old warrior/mentor/father figure.  But my two favorite characters in this series, and definitely two of the best characters in movie history are Darth Vader and Han Solo.  Darth Vader is one of the best villians in movie history.  We don't see a whole lot of him in this movie, unfortunately.  It wasn't until Empire Strikes Back that we really see how great a villian he is.  Han Solo is a wise-cracking mercenary smuggler who eventually realizes he can do more than just make money for himself, he can help the Rebel Alliance.  His journey is arguably just as interesting as Luke's.  His jokes and nicknames are hilarious.     The plot of this movie is very good.  Many people argue that this is a good romp, nothing more.  This was not a generic storyline at the time of its original release.  It is true that Lucas pulled many different ideas from different stories, but it is only because so many different people have tried to rip this off that many people consider it to be generic.  There really isn't a lot to say about this movie.  I love it, ever since I was a kid.  I don't really like any Sci-fi that was made before this (for instance Lost in Space and the original Star Trek series).  This is a great movie, and if you haven't seen it then go rent it.
B00005JLKN|5.0|Chronologically the second entry in the Hannibal Lecter saga, \\"Red Dragon\\" delivers everything, with an all-star cast, a fine screenplay, and haunting music from Danny Elfman. Sir Anthony returns for his curtain call to the role that launched him into Hollywood immortality. With some fancy computer work, Sir Anthony both looks and acts younger as the chilling Dr. Lecter, oozing menace and charm all in one. Edward Norton is appropriately tortured and duty-bound as Will Graham, the ex-FBI agent who caught Lecter (this is done in a chilling pre-credits sequence). Ralph Fiennes is evil and tormented as The Tooth Fairy, and Emily Watson is simply sublime as the woman who tames the beast. I felt that Mary Louise-Parker and the actor who played her son were under-used, but it doesn't detract from a great story. thrilling appetizer to \\"Silence Of The Lambs,\\" which is the prelude to the even more delicious \\"Hannibal.\\" the film should have been rated PG-13.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|I saw this movie when I was a kid....I'm now 55. It is STILL one of the most frightening movies about a possible nuclear holocaust. Even though it is dated in the time period it represents, it's a very graphic look at what could happen to everyday people in the US after the event. Scary. And I'm a teacher and I intend to show my students so that they will hopefully never let it happen. I highly recommend a look....
B000T06172|5.0|The quality of this re-master is excellent. Apparently, for this set, 'Wouldn't It Be Nice' has a new re-master (from the 1996 re-master). I can't tell a difference between the 1996 re-master and the 2000 re-master but this is because I haven't really compared them. No this version does not come with 'hang on to your ego' but notice the reduced price of this version compared to the mono+stereo CD version...you get what you pay for - and keep in mind you are getting Rolling Stone's #2 album-of-all-time pick for only $7.99. About 15 seconds after the train chugs away after the ending of 'Caroline, No' the listener will be surprised with a stunning a cappella from 'Wouldn't It Be Nice'<br /><br />If you are considering getting this version I'd say just go ahead and get the mono+stereo version: [[ASIN:B00005ASHM Pet Sounds]] - only two dollars more and you get the mono tracks plus 'Hang On To Your Ego'.<br /><br />However, if you just want to enjoy a phenomenal album at a reduced price, go ahead and get this.<br /><br />5/5
B002VPE1B6|5.0|ill just comment on the blu-ray, super sharp all the way thru, played it on a PS3, every ray of light, on every leaf, in the jungle was super sharp, very good definition of detail. as far as blu-rays go, its a buy. this one had some minor grain, but barely noticeable, i mean barely. and i wonder if its my 60 hz tv., overall 1080p pixel to pixel super-sharp hd throughout. i believe its the new king. nice.    ive seen it in imax 3D(digital-shutter glasses), digital widescreen 3D(polarized), and now on blu-ray, i gotta say digital wide 3D was the best. the aspect ratio was full wide(imax crops it), and the quality of the 3d seemed better. imax was HUGE and in my face, and awesome, but simple polarized 3D in full screen let me see the full frames, as they were meant to be seen. until i get a 240hz tv, the blu-ray is the way to go. the dark knight was my favorite blu-ray for detail up until tonight.  cons-  sadly, no scene where we see jake tame his big ride (imax only?)  no 3D. you do catch alot of detail, now that yer brain isnt working out the perspective, but those 3D flight scenes for me were like spiritual head.  no bonus materials, i know its only 20 bucks right now, but, jeez.  overall super-sharp blu-ray, its worth every penny.

I am a huge Sex and the City fan and this completed all that I wanted.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|After seeing him in Miami earlier this month, I had to have this one and it is great.  Two CDs and the concert DVD... terrific value and love the selections.

1934451320|4.0|Although I have not completed this book as it is set up as a weekly learning schedule by chapter, I find the information to be of great value in developing habits and thought processes that drive us forward into more positive creation on all levels of our human experience. This book teaches us the valuable insights into why we experience lack or abundance, health or disease, positive relationships or destructive,etc. and how to change negative habits and thinking patterns into ones that bring us closer to our dreams and well being. It is said that this is the book that the movie \\"The Secret\\" is based on, and these are the insights and processes that will bring us into harmony with the lives we wish to live.<br /><br />The down side of this book for me, is that is was written in the language of the turn of the century,(1912?) which I find the dialog of that time to be more complex and wordy than need be, and on occasion takes some concentration and time to decipher the true meaning. Yes the concepts can be deep, but one does not need to fully comprehend them to make the exercises work for oneself. Each week there is an exercise that so far seem to be attainable by the every day person. The only requirement is a commitment to doing the work to achieve the results.<br /><br />I understand that there is a more contemporary version of this work available, and I may try to find that copy as well.<br /><br />This book or its contemporary version is a great asset to anyone learning how to create more positive in their lives.
0756405890|5.0|Ahhh...  Just as I had begun to think all the good books had already been written.    I've just read the last word of The Name of the Wind, the echo of the first chapter is still faint in the last, and I am deeply satisfied.    Exquisitely crafted from the first chapter to the last.  Rothfuss weaves a rich tapestry of brilliantly written characters, wonderful dialogue, and a world so evocatively drawn I can very nearly tumble into it.  A beautifully paced tale, unravelled with so much care and artistry it felt like a seamless dream.    From the first word to the last, Rothfuss manages to sustain an unwavering consistency of excellence.  Not a moment of inattention, no condescension, no over-explaining, no overreaching, no self-indulgent spouting of the pen...  Just poetry and humor and passion in the midst of darkness and light.    Flawless.  This one goes on my \\"exalted\\" shelf, next to Zelazny, Tolkien, and Diana Wynne Jones.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Read the reviews of this version, knew already there would be three releases, hate the price gouging but not gonna wait until November to get a better version, which I will also purchase, so big business may win this one. But they have hundreds of other movies I haven't purchased, which I often watch once from Netflix and I am usually done. Overall I think I am ahead! ;-)    Amazon does rock, I love that I got this by 10 A.M. PST and didn't have to go to a store!    Not gonna review Avatar, enough of that already, obviously I overall love it, in spite of the derivative plot.    Live long and prosper!

B002C6A6N6|5.0|Jane Seymour is outstanding and very beautiful, If only Doctors realy cared about their patients the way Dr. Mike does it would be such a wonderful world. There are many things to marvel about in this series besides the great acting: the great horseback riding abilities of the entire cast, Jane Seymour on a trapeze, the beautiful scenery, The jump off the cliff (not sure if Jane actually did this). The 42 DVD's in this set are a bargain price at less than $2.00 per DVD, that's over 100 hours to spend with Jane and she's worth every penny!

3551354014|5.0|Several years ago I lived in Switzerland where I learned to speak German. Since then,  I have lost some of my ability to speak German, so I bought this book hoping it would be at an 'easy' read. It took a few pages to get into the right mindset to read in German, but now I am reading it a lot easier. I occasionally use my English version to help me understand the meanings of some words better. If I am understanding the words right, this German translation does capture much of the same feeling and mystery that is in the English version.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|Fahrenheit 9/11 is my favorite of Michael Moore's documentaries. Although Capitalism: A Love Story doesn't rise to the level of intensity of 9/11, it is still worthy of a full five stars. Packed with information and delivered in the way only Michael Moore can - with humor and heartbreak, wit and wisdom all rolled into one - this is the story of our American national god. It is the story of how we are willing to do anything, anything at all for money. I found the section about \\"dead peasant\\" life insurance policies taken out by huge corporations on the lives of their employees very eye-opening. We have certainly moved from being a government of the people, by the people and for the people to being a government of the corporations, by the corporations and for the corporations. A great documentary and a cautionary tale at the same time. Highly recommended.
1428101136|5.0|Far from the caricatured, cartoonish Frankenstein that appears every Halloween, Mary Shelley's monster is  a creature of refined human feelings, longing for love and acceptance, who turns to murder only after being repeatedly rejected by every human he encounters because of his hideous appearance.  It is his creator who is truly despicable because he regards his own creature as a demon and an enemy, never once admitting or accepting his own guilt for rejecting the creature who needed love and acceptance from him most of all.<br /><br />Shelley's classic leaves plenty of room for speculation -- just what message was she trying to send, what allegory was she trying to make, etc.?  However, one can set all these aside as I did, and simply enjoy this as a well-written book.  It is old-fashioned in style and language, but that makes it even more obvious what a truly phenomenal and ground-breaking book this must have been at the time it was published.<br /><br />George Guidall's narration is excellent and adds much to this classic novel.
B0035WTE2U|5.0|Hey, a soundtrack with nothing but AC/DC songs... how can you go wrong? 5/5    Now to those saying this is a greatest hits album... it's not. If it where a greatest hits album, it would include \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", \\"Long Way To The Top\\", \\"High Voltage\\", \\"The Jack\\" just to name a few of 550 other songs that would be on a greatest hits album if AC/DC where to release one.     If you pay attention to the album title, it says \\"Iron Man 2\\" ... Iron Man is a movie... get it? so therefor, this album is a SOUNDTRACK... not a GREATEST HITS.    Edit: I actually kind of want to lower my rating of this album now that I have seen the movie. As much as AC/DC is my all time favorite band... I just don't get this album? Only two AC/DC songs where used in the movie, \\"shoot to thrill\\" & \\"Highway To Hell\\"... I was really looking forward to hearing all these songs in the movie, and it turns out it is just an odd compilation of songs for what you would think is a soundtrack. So imagine my surprise when waiting for nothing but a score and AC/DC songs to rock on during the movie, and all of a sudden a song by \\"Big Audio Dynamite\\" starts playing :S    However the disc does come with a bonus disc of AC/DC videos with a couple of new video clips added to it. Shoot To Thrill and Highway To Hell, however the Highway To Hell in the movie is the original 1979 Bon Scott recording, and the new video for it is a 2010 live Brian Johnson recording.... which is cool I guess, but would have been even cooler if it was used in the movie and not just as a promotional tool.    So does this mean there will be another soundtrack released later with the songs from the actual movie? I dunno, this is just kinda odd. For AC/DC fans who just wanna buy an album with the bands logo printed on the front of an Iron Man 2 image with 95% of the songs not appearing in the movie, then it might be something worth checking out, however for me, already owning all AC/DC albums, I don't really see any point in buying it.
0783226063|4.0|Dune (1984) can be cheesy at times (with over the top acting by some), but it holds up in the viewers eye, as long as you read the book first. If you don't read the book first, there's a good chance you'll be lost, as the Dune universe can get pretty complicated fast. This movie is far from perfect, with an untested David Lynch (who isn't a big fan of science fiction) directing a movie based on a book he had never read. Unbelievably, his vision resonates fairly well. When first viewing this movie, I immediately saw the similarity with Eraserhead (his first movie) in terms of the industrial look and feel of that movie, with steam and a general dread tone. Does this work in the year 10191? To me, not really, but it's a Lynch thing; a sort of stamp or symbol. This movie (in contrast to the Syfy miniseries from 2000) has an edginess to it (hence, the industrial look, and the villains are nastier). In the 2000 miniseries, the tone is softer and more intellectual. I actually like the Syfy miniseries a tad more, but I still embrace this movie, which gives me the luxury of seeing two contrasting visions of Dune. There's great debate as to which adaptation is better, with the results usually being split. I can tell you that the soundtrack in this movie (courtesy of Toto) doesn't stack up to the superior Graeme Revell soundtrack from the miniseries. Still, Toto does a commendable job. As for the acting, it's hard to get used to the cast in this movie. Paul Atreides isn't portrayed as 'deeply' in this movie, compared to the 2000 miniseries; his aura is lighter-toned and somewhat goofy. Sting is believable in his role, and makes the Harkonnen cast a somewhat humorous bunch (but in a good way). Even David Lynch is in this movie with a cameo that had an oddness to it. Love it or hate it, Dune certainly has interesting characters, and like I said, it's highly recommended that you read the book before embarking on this wild journey. I will admit that it took 5 years and several viewings to really get on board with Dune. I think that the critics got it wrong in 1984, and unfairly panned this film, having not read the book first. The special features aren't much, with just a trailer, production notes, cast and filmmakers, and language selection (English and French).wings to really get on board with Dune.

B002GY9F9K|5.0|Being a Terry Goodkind follower of the sword of truth series, I can honestly say I was impressed beyond words when I watched the DVD set.    It makes an impression right off the bat and all I'll say to the ladies is \\"shirtless\\"...O...my...God!  Gulp...drool...drool...    The series provides breathtakingly beautiful vistas and after the first two episodes of a (very few) corny scenes between the two main characters it kicked into high gear with some excellently choreographed fight scenes.  With interesting side stories in each episode which expectedly deviates from the original written story, strangely compliments the characters and creates a well balanced and very enjoyable story which is engaging and fun to watch.     The creators of this Season of the Legend of the Seeker chose their actors, story line and director exceedingly well.  This DVD set has succeeded where others have failed before (e.g. The Dresden files - Jim butcher remake to DVD).  They have created a piece not unlike a big budget feature film.     The biggest complement I can give to all associated with the making of this extraordinary delight is that even with the book running in the background of my brain; I still noted and liked the revised story as shown on the DVD set. The DVD's added to the books of Terry Goodkind and did not confuse or irritate.    What is also a really lovely touch is the 3D see-through images on the DVD Discs, which is classically beautiful and adds some magic even before you start watching the series.    All round, you really can't go wrong with adding this one to your collection!

0486236951|1.0|This book, a great disappointment, is part of the Dover \\"reproduction\\" series (ca. 1978).  It would be of interest to the needleworker who is interested in late Victorian designs, as they come from a collection published ca. 1900 (\\"The Chief Pattern Book of Embroidery Patterns for the Improvement of Artistic Embroidery on Linens and the Promotion of Good Handicrafts,\\" Nuremberg, Germany:  Johann Merkenthaler).<br /><br />As such, there is little instructional material for those who wish to learn these techniques (principally cutwork with satin stitch and \\"bridges\\" & line work with stem/backstitch).  There are diagrams, perhaps from the first edition, but they have no numbers to indicate where component stitches begin and end, although with the basic nature of them, the needleworker with a little experience will be able to figure them out.<br /><br />Stitches include stem stitch, backstitch, straight stitch (i.e., satin stitch), lazy daisy, running, long & short (long & short satin), seed (short satin), padded satin (guess what?), buttonhole/overcast, feather, star (Smyrna cross with arms of different lengths), herringbone, couching, and a few others.<br /><br />Instruction pages include a brief history, how to transfer the patterns (air- and water-disappearing markers; tailor's chalk; embossing; BUT pouncing - the historical technique - is not mentioned!), and thread/fabric/hoops.  Not a lot, folks, and certainly no step-by-step or how to incorporate the designs into modern work (such as table or bed linen).  The \\"188 designs\\" are there but no \\"techniques\\".<br /><br />If you are looking for instruction in whitework/cutwork techniques, this book is useless.<br /><br />In place of this book, I recommend Th&eacute;r&egrave;se deDillmont's \\"Encyclopedia of Needlework\\" (ca. 1884).  It is now titled \\"The Complete DMC Encyclopedia of Needlework,\\" Running Press, various years, incl. 1978).  This historic book has many how-to and in-progress diagrams of the techniques, plusalphabets and other design elements.  If you purchase Houck's book, consider it an adjunct to the deDillmont and containing patterns without instruction.  (The deDillmont covers a multiplicity of different techniques, not just whitework.)  mb

B0013ND30W|4.0|This movie came out the year after I was born, but if I remember correctly, the last time I saw it was in the movie theatres when I was a child.  Although it's great family fare, it's not as good as other Disney classic animated films.  Along with the blu-ray disc I also received a regular DVD version in a cardboard slip case.  It would have been nice if the plastic case held all three DVDs inside.  Now, I have to be concerned with losing the DVD that is just held on the front cover of the plastic case with a bit of glue.  The second blu-ray disc that comes with the movie has some fun games to play.  In fact, to me that was the best part of this package.  One of the games where you have to follow along with the forest animal's dance steps is not easy.  The one where the wicked queen tries to read your mind is indeed a mind blower.  It definitely figured out what I was thinking.  Probably the only difficulty I had with the games was with my remote.  A child would definitely have to be told how to get from one place to the next using the blu-ray disc player remote.

0553381687|4.0|While technically classified as a fantasy series, I would push for a classification of a form of historical fantasy.  The world that the story takes place in is fictional and there are some supernatural elements - but the lifestyle is very much like that of medieval Europe.  There are kings and queens, castles, tourneys, and wars, politics and intrigue.  This book (and the rest of the series) would fit right in for a historical fiction reader.  While reading you almost forget that this does not take place in Europe.  The descriptions are so detailed that the world and its people absolutely come alive.<br /><br />The book is structured where each chapter is narrated by a different character - mostly the Stark family with a few others thrown in for good measure.  This layout allows the reader to get into the minds of each of these characters and really develop a strong feeling for them - positive or negative, you will definitely have your favorites.  As the story progresses, these characters spread out over the vast world and through the shifting narrators you get to see what is going on all over Westeros.<br /><br />This is the first book in a series of seven - with four having been published so far.  If you look at the whole series as one book - book one serves as an introduction and exposition.  You learn who all of the key players are, their back stories, whose side they are on, where their loyalties lie, among other things.  These will become very important in the following books.  While this serves as an introduction to the characters, so much happens in their lives in this book, you will not be bored.<br /><br />The other books in this series are: Book 2 - A Clash of Kings, Book 3 - A Storm of Swords, Book 4 - A Feast for Crows, and upcoming Book 5 - A Dance with Dragons.  There is to be a series made from these books on HBO likely to premiere in Spring 2011.  A card and board game has been made from these books as well - I have played a little, but always lose terribly to my boyfriend!<br /><br />A definite worth-while read.<br /><br />4.5 out of 5 stars.end!

B000E6EGZ0|3.0|Has anyone else noticed how coarse and screechy this new mastering is?  Some improvement.  It's so overbright I have to turn the treble all the way down.  Furthermore, the peak overmodulation distortion is atrocious and frequent.  The earlier DoubleDecca issue ([[ASIN:B0000042FF Puccini: Tosca]]) was much smoother.  These 96mH remasterings by Decca have certainly been a mixed bag; many make these older recordings virtually unlistenable, so agressive and and ugly the sound. It's like the inverse of what EMI is doing to all their recordings by filtering and smoothing them into oblivion.  Decca's tear your eardrums up.<br /><br />I don't see what the negative fuss over Di Stefano, to my ears, he sings just fine.  Lovely colorations, and I hear true mezza voce in alt, NOT falsetto.  We should all sing so well when presumably \\"past our prime\\".  He is especially splendid in Act 3.  This is precisely where Price falls down on the job, sounding like an overparted lyric soprano.  Taddei blusters away; he was much better around the same time (1962) live from Buenos Aires with Crespin -- more nuanced, subtler, revealing the great singing actor he was.  And why couldn't Karajan get the shepherd urchin to sing in tune?  Was this supposed to be a \\"naturalistic\\" effect?  Children can sound like plain peasants and still sing in tune; I do not think this \\"effect\\" works.  Overall, I would give the performance a solid B.

B0030Y11XS|5.0|This latest production by Michael Moore is satire as only he can do it: a good laugh with a hard kick to those who preach outlandish, outdated notions. His only rival in our times is Jon Stewart. His whole body of work is almost as good as Candide, the work of perhaps the greatest satirist of Western litterature.
0385737424|3.0|I got this in the hopes that it would be a great book for my kids one day. Newberry Award and influenced by Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time, it seemed like a pretty good bet, but I was disappointed. The story is interesting for the most part but it is simply not developed enough. It was a little hard to follow and the characters were not really that likable. And then there is the single mother...The book brings up the fact that the father is not there but does not explain why.  And I don't see why it was necessary to make the mother some kind of kleptomaniac at work. The way she presents it is a bit funny as an adult but do I really want my children reading this and getting the idea that stealing from work is okay? And they spend so much time developing the whole game show thing but in the end it just doesn't add very much to the story. In the end, I think I will end up giving away the book. It isn't something I want to keep in my library.

B001GKYBXA|5.0|I am 55 years old and came of age listening to The Beatles. They not only changed my young view of music and life but in retrospect changed the world view. Truly amazing shift politically, socially, fashion, and well just changed everything.<br /><br />I've always favored John Lennon for his take no prisoners approach. A true artist by any definition. Paul was the guy who made him palatable to the masses but I digress.<br /><br />This recording is what I imagine The Beatles would be doing if they survived intact today. This is a remarkable record!!!<br /><br />Its void of commercial concerns and just a great artist doing what he does best... creating art from the soul.<br /><br />Why have I not heard this before??<br /><br />To the detractors I offer that Strawberry Fields was not well received when it came out but has proven to be a visionary piece of work. I do not suggest that this is on the same level but it comes close. We need more of this from Paul.<br /><br />This is good stuff.
0451530837|5.0|In Jane Austen's time, young women were taught that it was practically their duty to \\"marry well\\" -- someone of at least equal social/financial standing.<br /><br />But if a woman turned down a suitor for being poor, she ran the risk of losing the man she loved. That's the problem for Anne Elliott, the heroine of Jane Austen's final novel \\"Persuasion\\" -- a delicate romance that takes place AFTER the romance, rejection and heartrending sorrow. There's some slight roughness around the edges, but the story and the characters are simply brilliant.<br /><br />Eight years ago, Anne Elliott was engaged to the handsome, intelligent and impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to dump him by the family friend Lady Russell.<br /><br />Now she's twenty-seven (ancient by the time's standards), and her vain father Sir Walter is facing financial ruin. So he decides to relocate to Bath and rent out the vast family estate -- and it turns out that the new tenant is Frederick's brother-in-law. Of course, Anne still loves Frederick, but he doesn't seem to feel the same, especially since he's rumored to be interested in some younger, flirtier girls.<br /><br />And Anne's worries increase when she joins her family in Bath, where her father is attempting to live the lifestyle he feels he deserves (since he's a baronet). His heir, William Elliott, recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne. But Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives... even if she doesn't realize how Frederick truly feels about her.<br /><br />It's pretty obvious that Jane Austen wrote \\"Persuasion\\" late in her life -- not only is Anne Elliott older than her other heroines, but she seems to have been more sympathetic to women who bowed to society's \\"persuasions.\\" This was the last book that Austen wrote before her untimely death, and it was only published posthumously.<br /><br />As a result, the book can be a little rough and the story is rather simple.

0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games is one of the best books I've read in a while. Well-paced action, excellent character development, and clear prose make this novel stand out. Best of all, the sixteen year-old female protagonist is believable and as a character, she is peerless in this genre.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This BluRay of Avatar is simply stunning..!! It is by far the best BluRay transfer I've ever seen. Both audio and video are flawless. As one who preferred the non-3D version, this is the perfect buy.<br /><br />I am not going to review the movie as I'm sure most of us knows it pretty well by now.<br /><br />I can highly recommend it.
B002ZIAC26|5.0|As a lover of all kinds of music, I sample a lot of stuff. Over the years (I'm 37) I've listened to a lot of artists that might get awkwardly categorized with Beach House. Velvet Underground, Belle and Sebastian, Sigur Ros, perhaps some shoegaze bands, or maybe even some female mid-seventies singer-songwriters are used in efforts to discribe this music. But nothing I can think of at the moment comes to mind when trying to express the beauty of album. Dreamy without being sleepy, emotional without being dramatic, impressive without being virtuoso, and somehow pop without being cheeze. I haven't purchased anything in a long time that I wish to hear over and over as I find myself doing with Teen Dream. The DVD of videos (of each song on the album) that comes with the CD is very good as well. Beck did this same sort of thing a couple of years ago but the videos here are much more interesting as each one is made/directed by a different person and very well done. This is one to buy.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|This may just be the best comedy I have seen in years. If you like Betty White you will love this movie!
B002VECM72|5.0|This is one of my favorites by far, Great story thrown in with some sports and you have a can't miss. Truly an inspiration to others from both sides of the story. Would strongly recommend!
0823023494|3.0|Ok, I will start off by saying that I have only perused through this book. I will admit there is some usefulness to this book, like basic shapes and what not, which is why I ranked it 3 stars. However, if you value your money, if you value cartoons at all, if you value quality, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!    You will instead order: Cartoon Animation by Preston Blair. Preston Blair was a former Disney animator as well. In the 30s. And he animated some of the most famous parts of Fantasia. Then he went on to work for MGM on Tex Avery's shorts. He's good, knows his stuff, and his book is often found in animation courses.    This Tom Guy has no respect at all. His own character design is an eye sore, which doesn't surprise me as he mistakenly devoted a whole page to comparing early Mickey Mouse to Hello Kitty?!? Early Mickey Mouse is WAY more expressive and complex than Hello Kitty, so how could we expect him to do anything right? Sure, 1920-1930s animation was usually quite \\"simplistic\\" in its structure, it not being until around the 1940s when things really start to get hip with the WB crowd, with the 50s ushering in the complex UPA style (angular and designy) but my GOD! To just totally dismiss it, comparing it to HELLO KITTY, good ol' fingerless straight up \\"Fisher Price Little People\\" like Hello-Kitty. WOW. WOW. And even then, Hello Kitty should be offended as well by his depiction! Has he ever even seen a black and white cartoon before? Hell, even the early 1920s Felix the cat cartoons (which were practically like animated coloring books as they lacked shading) are still quite complex, and dynamic in their movements and expressions. Early animators and cartoonists alike usually came from fine art backgrounds, mostly classically trained, or learned the ropes of animation under those who had.    Seriously, this book is just arrogant hogwash. Like I said, BUY THE PRESTON BLAIR BOOK! LEARN FROM A MASTER! Sure, you could say, \\"but isn't preston blair an old dude involved in the early days?\\"  Well, very well then, weren't the Renaissance masters just some old dudes involved in some early realistic painting style movement?    Watch old cartoons. And read the blog of John K (the SPUMCO/ren&stimpy guy for those of you not in the know): johnkstuff dot blogspot dot com. He's always posting lessons on there, FOR FREE, and pointing out people you could truly learn a thing or two from. Just watch old cartoons, study their forms, sit there going frame by frame.    JUST WOWOWOW. This book is OK as a beginner's book, as it does point out some basics, and talk about hierarchy and such. But seriously, if you're real serious about this stuff, GET THE PRESTON BLAIR BOOK, do as I said above.    I say this book is POISON because it just reeks of the \\"new school\\" CAL ARTS/corporate animation attitude that's actually ruined animation in the last 30 years. It's like \\"uhhh really. He's going to tell us how to add personality to our own characters, when uhhhh his characters actually seem to lack personality and fluid behaviour.\\" Seriously, don't believe me? Turn on Disney or CN during the day. Then go watch some of these \\"emotionless\\" Mickey Mouse cartoons. By the way, those cartoons were created by and mostly animated by Ub Irwerks, another FAMOUS animator, who although failed to make popular cartoons on his own after leaving Disney, still managed to vastly influence animators and cartoonists the world over - even those like Osamu Tezuka (creator of ASTROBOY.)
0307454541|4.0|I really thought about giving this book 5 stars, but just can't because of the beginning of the book.  I give it 4 1/2 stars.  I almost returned this book to the library after the first 150 pages.  If you do read this book, be prepared for the beginning to be slow and boring!<br /><br />That being said all I have to say is WOW!  This book really gets you thinking!  It is about a man that is hired in Sweeden to uncover the truth about a girl that disappeared years ago.  This story will take you for a ride...a rollercoaster ride!  I loved Salander's character...she was my favorite character in the book.<br /><br />If you like the show Criminal Minds then you should love this book.  It does have a few disturbing scenes in it, but they are important and necessary to the story in my opinion.  Also, it really irritates me when I read reviews on here that complain that they read this book because of all the great reviews, but didn't like the book because of the disturbing scenes...did you not read the reviews people?  Most of the reviews say something about violence in this book...did you think they were lying and you would read the book anyway?  Come on people really?  If you can't handle disturbing or violent scenes then don't read the book!<br /><br />I hated the beginning of this book, but loved it by the end!  I can't wait to read The Girl Who Played With Fire (Millennium #2)<br /><br />Also, I just found out that the movie comes out in July!  I can't wait to see it!
B0037XPP7U|5.0|This is one of my favoite films. From the amazing music, acting, story line, and art direction, it all culminates into a full experience where your suspention of disbelief brings you into Elizabeth's world.
B000AP04MO|1.0|During my viewing, I hung in there with `Two for the Road' for what seemed like hours. It couldn't have gone on nearly as long as it felt: the DVD jacket promises a merciful `finita' after one hundred and eleven minutes. Waiting for it, I couldn't remember time hanging that b-o-r-i-n-g-l-y heavy since my high school sixth period Latin class. I refused to give up on it, entertaining the notion there would emerge some semblance of a plot...... like `it simply can't go on and on and on like this without something happening sooner of later.......\\" Well, it did and it does. How the most photogenic and stunningly beautiful actress on earth (Audrey Hepburn) couldn't manage a film possessing a plot is incomprehensible.     It is, however, a film of distinction. It is the first I have had that found it's way into a garbage can immediately upon its initial viewing.
0792838068|2.0|This movie is terrible. Its only redeeming quality is the committed (and Oscar-winning) performance of Nicolas Cage. The fact that Elisabeth Shue was nominated for an Oscar for her performance is a crime. She's awful. She has two facial expressions. She isn't even able to muster up one tear. It's a horrible, horrible, horrible performance.    The movie has no plot. Everything about it is gratuitous. The cinema verite feel that writer/director Mike Figgis went for is a joke; the movie isn't even vaguely realistic. There's almost zero backstory, and the characters are completely one-dimensional. It's impossible to relate to these characters. In what universe does this film take place?    The screenplay is chock-full of cheesy lines. Avoid at all costs. Two stars for Cage; zero for everyone else.
B001OQCV6K|3.0|Beyond the issues of being forced to watch trailers and other material after inserting this disc, and being all the more frustrated in having stopped watching the movie half-way through and then not being able to use any chapter selection or resume feature to pick up my viewing where myself and my daughter had left off at (this might be a failing in my Blu-ray player, but it seems to be more a failing in the disc authoring by the studio), there's the question of just how good this movie is.<br /><br />Should I leave a bunch of clues and have you, the readers, decipher those clues in your own Holmes-ian manner?  Nah, let me dispense with the suspense there and quickly summarize.  For much of this film I (and my daughter with me) was under the impression that I was watching a Harry Potter film.  The dark arts and such that are featured in much of the film seem to be ripped straight out of some of the more recent Potter films.  Given the amount of money those films have made, it's not that surprising that someone would try to cash in on the popularity of that style and genre, but I'm not so certain that I like Sherlock Holmes in Harry Potter style myself.<br /><br />Realistically, I admit that I grew up much more a fan of other famous detectives and never quite got into reading that much of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's creation, but still, I expect mystery and intrique in a Sherlock Holmes story and not quite what we got in this Guy Ritchie vision of Holmes.  Robert Downey, Jr.'s portrayal of Holmes was fine, and Jude Law was also fine in the Watson role, but the story itself rather bored me (and my daughter for that matter) and left me thinking this just isn't the kind of film that I'd want to make a purchase of.<br /><br />Rent first if possible (on demand rules!).  You'll be glad you did.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|The makers of Avatar have figured out how to milk its fans. This copy does not come with the extended 40 minutes. And it doesnt have a 3d option. So basically they want you to buy this twice. Expect this to be the future of movies. There excuse for no 3d option is that the technology hasn't reach the public yet. And yet I own Coraline on 3d and its all on 1 cd. Boooooooo to your way of thinking.
B00007FOMP|5.0|I am really impressed with the sound quality. However, the album data is not there. I'm use to seeing CD info pop up when I insert CD's. Well is is all about the music.     The CD artwork was another alluring factor. But, I soon discovered that I could only appreciate the graphics on the cover. That really took me back to the 70's. I'm not so sure I like that experience. I'm an avid iTunes user :-)

0385333846|4.0|\\"Billy Pilgrim has become unhinged in time.\\" It's the classic line that starts off the classic story of what is considered to be Kurt Vonnegut's opus, Slaughterhouse Five. For those who didn't have to read this seminal tale in their college literature classes, Slaughterhouse Five is considered by many to be the ultimate anti-war satire, a story that scolds the meaning of all war (via examining the fire bombing of Dresden during WWII) through fairly anti-jingo themes and a bumbling optometrist (Billy Pilgrim) who claims to have learned the meaning (or rather, meaninglessness) of life from a troupe of extraterrestrials that locked him in an intergalactic zoo towards the end of his time-traveling adventures.<br /><br />Re-reading that last sentence will give you a fair idea of the nature of Slaughterhouse Five: it conveys it's painfully serious message through absurd and hilarious means--a text-book technique in the world of satire and a more basic tenant of sarcasm. Slaughterhouse Five--which most likely gained much of its prominence as an anti-war tome released on the cusp of the Vietnam Era--offers the reader a narrative that periodically sets up check points that challenge the reader into looking beneath the surface of the prose and to figure out the inherent symbolism Vonnegut is trying so desperately to display. And on that level, the book succeeds. We're constantly introduced to a cadre of oddball avatars that could represent just about any solider involved in any war in a foreign land, and we immediately learn how they die before we learn how the war effected them, how they in turn effected the war, and the indelible mark they've left on the world by being just another individual in the never-ending line of individuals that make up human existence. It's in this message--that even the most random and common life matters, no matter how inconsequential and expendable it may seem--that the book soars. Unfortunately, it's in its relevance where the book sinks.<br /><br />While the book is exceptionally well written, with Vonnegut providing innocent yet lush descriptions and verbiage, Slaughterhouse Five will easily collapse under its own \\"classic\\" status for some readers. Despite what the late Vonnegut (and, most likely, your college professor) probably wanted, this book won't resonate with everyone. There's the obvious risk that some just wont get the message of the book--whether it's the message conveyed above or another, maybe more personal, message entirely--and take it's lofty tale too seriously, while those who will get the subtext just won't care. However, that's the unfortunate price that comes from being considered a classic work of art. That said, the book is regarded as a classic for a reason, and active readers would be doing themselves a favor to find out why.<br /><br />Michael P.

0385523386|5.0|This book is a must read for any book club. Not only is it well written and captivating; but this is the type of book you absolutely NEED to talk to people about once you finish reading it. This is not the kind of book you finish and think, \\"hmmm...that was nice.\\" You are emotional! Outraged by a prison system so clearly broken and corrupt. Horrified by Piper's description of lecherous guards \\"patting her down\\" only to cop a feel and make lewd comments. How powerless the prisoners are in the face of such inappropriate behavior and other injustices faced on a daily basis. As a mother, the description of toddlers being dragged, screaming and crying, out of their mother's arms at the end of visiting hours was beyond heart breaking. The idea that a pregnant woman in prison would give birth, only to have their newborn taken away from them by a family member immediately following the delivery, was like a punch to the gut. And most of these women were behind bars for minor drug infractions. Families ripped apart for nothing.<br /><br />There were many times that I had to remind myself that these characters were real people and not just fictional beings. Each and every woman to whom we are introduced captivates us. There needs to be a sequel so that we can find out what has become of Pop, Natalie, Yoga Janet and the rest of the gang. Of course, we hope for the best; but as Piper illustrates, the chance of success on \\"the outside\\" for most of these women is slim.<br /><br />I thank Piper for having the courage to share her story with the world. Hopefully this will shine a spotlight on a system that desperately needs a massive overhaul.
B0024FADAQ|5.0|This was ordered as a treat for my grandchildren. My son, their dad, loved this movie when he was growing up, so when I saw the anniversary edition...I thought it would be a good idea to show it to his sons. They loved it, too. I wish more of the older fantasy and science fiction movies would follow in these footsteps with re-releases or anniversary editions. The color is better and the sound is improved from the original.
0312360266|1.0|I was really looking forward to reading this series after getting addicted to other vamp series but unfortunatley, my addiction was short-lived.  I actually threw the book in the garbage after chapter 14.  Why is it in today's society do authors feel like they have to use vulgor language and sex to sell books?  I may have loved this series if it weren't for that.  I try to raise my children (16,14,12) to be good productive citizens with standards and morals higher than most and apparently they are higher than the author's.  The language was distasteful and the oral sex scene was completely appalling.  Neither of them made the book better.  In fact, it drew away from it.  Too bad the Ms. Casts don't understand the concept of PG or even PG13 when writing a young adult series!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Enough with the complaining it's not the special edition. I have disliked the special edition of almost every single film I've seen. They mostly have scenes that are redundant and not needed to telling the story, or scenes that are just plain bad and were excised for good reason. Fellowship of the Ring is the only film in that trilogy that on the whole I think benefitted, although there are things they added that I dislike. Avatar looks amazing on blu-ray and is well worth 20 measley bucks. I wouldn't bee surprised if the special edition looks worse since it will have a longer running time and more special features, meaning a lower bit rate.
B0036B8MXC|5.0|When \\"Spartacus - Blood and Sand\\" first appeared on Starz I was hoping for at the very least a minor \\"Rome\\" rip-off. So enamored of the HBO series I was hungry for more drama, intrigue, sex and blood in the Republican era of ancient Rome that I reluctantly decided to give \\"Spartacus\\" a chance.<br /><br />  The first episode was for me a bit of a snooze and heavily influenced by \\"300\\" in it's dark visual style. But I did find the performances arresting enough to give episode two a go. That is when \\"Spartacus\\" takes off and soars to bloody glory. The story grabs you by the gut leading you on into a world of high drama, sex, murder, lust, greed, sadism, that is both thrilling and mind-blowing. If you ever wondered if you could actually watch a gladiatorial contest, this is the test for you! Visceral, bloody splendor unfolds in the arena of Capua. If you have a weak stomach then you are in for some cinematic cgi shocks! I found the whole thing thrilling but many times I had to shut my eyes to the on screen gore. Long gone are the days of showing just the top of Pompey's severed head as in \\"Cleopatra\\" (1963) in an olive amphora. Now the severed heads go flying though the air spurting gallons of blood.<br /><br />  But the real treasure in Spartacus is found in the interesting writing that challenges and often elevates the story to a poetic, moving and often comedic brilliance. Sharp witty, repartee in a pseudo kind of Latin meets Shakespeare shows how varied and multi leveled our English language can be.<br /><br />Then there are the performances by the cast. Andy Whitfield as the hero of the slave rebellion is magnificent. A real find for the show and brings a sexy gravitas to the proceedings. John Hannah as Batiatus takes the bull by the horns and holds nothing back in his bold and fun portrait of the owner of the Lunista. Gladiatorial nemesis and blood brother to Spartacus is Crixus played by Manu Bennett. A hunk who can act the hell out of this part. He is a joy to watch as he battles for his forbidden love entangled in the midst of a demanding mistress' lust. As the spoilt Ilithyia wife to the man who brought Spartacus to his fate as a gladiator the marvelous Viva Bianca is immensely wicked and immensely fun to watch. Then there is the best surprise of the entire show, Lucy Lawless as Lucretia wife of Batiatus and domina of the Lunista. This cunning, conniving, depraved, wicked, intelligent woman of the first century B.C. is the roll of a lifetime for Miss Lawless. She is magnificent, and splendoriforus in the part. A real treat that is the cherry on the top of the Roman feast that is \\"Spartacus - Blood and Sand\\".for his forbidden love entangled in the midst of a demanding mistress' lust. As the spoilt Ilithyia wife to the man who brought Spartacus to his fate as a gladiator the marvelous Viva Bianca is immensely wicked and immensely fun to watch.

0307341569|5.0|In a sea of mediocre thriller and crime novels, wow does this book stand out.  She didn't create a clich&eacute;d step-by-step plot like so many do (and I'm a crime novel junkie).  Flynn didn't toss the characters to the side like afterthoughts.  Further - there was no predictability.  Dark Places compared to most other crime/thriller books would be like an Oscar winning film compared to a made-for-TV movie with bad acting.<br /><br />What she did do is write about very complex characters in a way that you felt emotional attachment.  The poverty that Ben, the brother convicted of the murder, endured growing up because he was old enough to understand and feel ashamed.  The despair of Patty trying to raise children on an unproductive farm with no income. The coldness of Libby and how detached from life she is; truly emotionally disturbed.  The details that make Runner, Libby's father, so low on the totem pole of human character.  And Diondra, the wild girlfriend of Ben that has had no parenting, too much money, and too much time in rural Kansas.<br /><br />Aside from the impeccable story line and the attention to detail and character, the plot itself is one that will have you reading way past your bedtime.  Just when you might get sleepy, you'll turn the page and there will be another flashback to give you the adrenaline to carry on and read just a little more.<br /><br />I read the author's 1st book, Sharp Objects, and Dark Places is miles beyond it in character and plot development and even just the writing quality.  So - if you read Sharp Objects and didn't love it, give this one a shot.  It won't disappoint.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I purchased this DVD used and it came exactly as was promised.

I was wary of purchasing a used DVD but it was in perfect condition and played flawlessly. Thanks!

B001PPGAIA|5.0|This was a birthday buy for my sister who had never seen this movie. This movie is romance wrapped around a very startling piece of Australian history. Everyone should see it!
B001QOGYBI|5.0|Provided you like off beat, \\"quirky\\" movies. This movie is definitely a bit on the weird side, and that's not a bad thing! Too many movies these days are carbon copies of each other, the same tired formulas, and uninspired actors. But every once in a while a movie comes along that is a breath of fresh air, and beats to it's own drum. The Fantastic Mr Fox is that movie. When you begin the opening scene, the Ballad of Davey Crockett is playing, and that alone lets you know this is not going to be an ordinary movie. At first I thought that the movie could have used a little more color, but after viewing this movie again and again (and again) I started to appreciate the subtle colors of the landscapes, buildings and even the animals. Not too much, not too little.     The soundtrack has an off-beat feel to it, which gives this film even more life and adds to the rich texture of the movie. The stop animation may take a while to get used to. But give it a chance, it is very well done. The facial expressions of the characters are hilarious, and the film doesn't rely on crude jokes to make you laugh out loud, or gross you out. The voicing was done beautifully, William DeFoe steals the scenes he's in playing the rat, and I can't think of anyone better to cast as Mr and Mrs Fox. George Clooney and Meryl Streep are wonderful, and their son Ash voiced by Jason Schwartzman struggles as their son desperately trying to prove he is an athlete.     As the movie progresses, we see that the world of Mr Fox is more than it seems, as he steals from the meanest farmers alive (Boggis Bunce and Bean) and has to work fevereshly to stay one step ahead of the farmers who want to \\"blow the cuss to smithereens.\\" Mr Fox will go through many obstacles to prove he is the \\"Fantastic Mr Fox\\" and the rest of the animals are along for the ride. And just when it seems all is well, an unexpected occurance happens and things are back to square one all over again.     This film, as another reviewer said, is full of intelligence. I couldn't agree more. This is not a fast paced movie, nor is it one where things blow up or gunshots ring out every ten minutes. Don't expect to watch this movie expecting lots of action, nor for something to grab you the first scene and not let go. There is no dramatic climax to speak of, and the end of the movie may end in ways that people don't want. (How many movies end with animals dancing?) I think that ending is perfect, as it adds to the quirkiness of the movie. Overall, this movie is a breath of fresh air, something to be enjoyed again and again. Perfect Sunday afternoon viewing, or after a long stressful day. Highly recommended.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Every now and then, real life comes along in a story that both warms your heart, makes you laugh and challenges the way people should treat one another. In this great piece of movie making Sandra Bullock bravely earns her Oscar with a brilliant performance of a strong Southern woman whose gutsy attitude makes all the difference to a young man who needed it. This is a must see, one that you will want to keep and watch many times.
B000002U9W|3.0|Wow-This album is a trip. It seems like an entire instrumental but quickly changes around from funk to psychedelic and back again. This was just the tip of the ice-berg for what was to come later from Pink Floyd. 1970 was a new decade and Floyd fully embraces the new ways (at that time)to fool around with sound and rythyms.  What really is a standout on this album is 'Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast' which  follows this bloke around his kitchen as he fries eggs, bacon, pours coffee, slurps it down,etc. It's as if they stuck a mic into the cereal bowl itself to trip you out as you listen. Very interesting stuff. A must have for the Floyd fan.
B0000CE9VW|5.0|Great CD if you do not feeling like buying Pantera whole collection. The music is top notch straight forward rock that assults your senses. This band would have grabed it all if the could of held it toghter after Dimebags death. The DVD is really good early concert footage and to be that is the best because it is raw.
B000PFFXOS|2.0|did they have to mess up a great thing.  As the previous reviewers stated, this is NOT a CD version of the original.  It's getting nearly impossible to find \\"original\\" vinyl recordings on CD anymore.  \\"They\\" have to add bonus tracks, re-mix, etc, etc.  Too bad that those that never had the opportunity to hear the originals will never experience how great they were (unless they can find a copy on vinyl).
0307454541|2.0|Wading through Stieg Larsson's Girl With the Dragon Tattoo was one tough slog.  Early in the book, he threw too many characters at me, all with the same last name, most of whom didn't matter much.  This fit his narrative style -- telling rather than showing --  since much of the telling didn't matter either.  The hero went to his cottage and made himself two liver sausage and pickle sandwiches. Yippee!<br /><br />This is a best seller?<br /><br />I realize The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a translated novel, but the sheer drudgery of the tale was no fault of the translator.  The book started out at a crawl, got somewhat interesting in the middle, but tailed off badly after the hero solved the mystery of what happened to a victim in the 60's (which I had figured out by about page thirty).  Lisbeth Salandar, the heroine, was one of my biggest disappointments.  Many reviewers liked her.  I wanted to feel empathy for the woman, given her terrible childhood, but I just couldn't get past her selfish, mean-spirited personality.  Also, in a story about the evils of rape, why is the heroine making a living hacking into peoples' computers and stealing their most intimate secrets?<br /><br />Two stars, and that's a stretch.<br /><br />Joe
B001SMC91M|4.0|I don't like a lot of the newer music today... I'm sort of a retro music fan.  I love classic R&B, Soul, and Funk.  I got this CD without knowing anything about Black Joe Lewis &  The Honeybears... honestly, I liked the name of the group so I thought I'd give it a try!  I lucked out - because this is a fun, dance-along, high-energy CD that feels like the older music I love.    Black Joe Lewis reminds me of James Brown, and the sound is sort of bluesy...but up-tempo.  I love the horns, I love the beat, I love the vocals... I would love to see this group live.    There are only 10 tracks and they really fly by way too fast.  But it's great fun for driving with the windows down, or dancing, or (okay, I know, I'm middle-aged) cleaning the house to.
B00008PW3Q|2.0|\\"Peacekeeper\\" and the title cut are very good productions that should make future compilations (or maybe they have already).  Otherwise, this is mostly a mix of Buckingham solo stuff, Nicks solo stuff with John & Mick backing them up which makes it Fleetwood Mac proper. Well, no it doesn't because Christine is no longer in the band and she is very much missed here.  18 songs was far too many, time to hang it up Big Mac and do the occasional nostalgia tour.

B00368Q3UY|5.0|Every year I get my boyfriend a new mp3 player and this seemed like more of a novelty than a true player, but for what it does he has no complaints and finds new uses for it every day - in particular, scaring the **** out of people who hold it while he turns it on. This thing is LOUD. Takes a while to get used to the jog wheel, and of course there is no playlist, but for the price, portability and performance, it's a must have for any music lover.
096798467X|4.0|I have always wanted an outdoor oven.  I love to cook, bake, and hate the (cooking - oven) heat during the summer.  When I came across this book a few years ago I wasn't quite ready, but kept thinking about it.  Then I started going to different web sites and exploring what other people are doing with outdoor bake ovens (WOW! - People are talented!).  When I decided to actually tackle an outdoor bake oven for myself I came back to this book and purchased it.<br /><br />The author makes you realize that you can do it yourself.  It is empowering.  My outdoor bake oven isn't exactly like his, but that is the beauty of this book.  He doesn't recommend you make it 'just like his', you can make it as you like still using the same or similar techniques.<br /><br />If you want a bake oven for yourself, read this book.  You can do it.  Mine cost me a total of $325.00 - and that was on the high end.  You can do it for a lot less.  I would not have had the courage to even start this project without the book, but if kids can make an oven (under his direction), I KNEW I could!  And the recipes are great too!<br /><br />And now that I'm actually baking in my oven... WOW it is AWESOME!  The food is great.  Great pizzas, bread, roasts, casseroles, and whatever you can think of to cook.  We love it!
0307454541|4.0|There is probably not much more to be said about this book, that has not been said already. From my own point of view, I thought the first 150 - 200 pages were a bit slow moving, and although it held my interest, I was beginning to wonder what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />However, once the two main protagonists, journalist, Mikael Blomkvist, the girl with the dragon tattoo, herself, Lisbeth Salander, start to really investigate the disapperance, in the 1960s of Harriet Vanger that I found myself hooked. I wont say too much more, as I do not want to give away any of the plot, but overall, I thought that this is a thriller that is a cut above most of the rest, with great characters and a good, thought provoking, storyline.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|2009 update<br />Spectacular - I wish the 9/9/09 Beatles remaster were this well recorded.<br /><br />Elektra has re-released all the Doors CDs. They uploaded the master tapes to 24 bit/96khz (nearly SACD quality) and then remapped it back to regular CD format (16bit/44khz). The result is much more dynamic and accurate. If your copy doesn't say 24bit, throw it out and get the new ones. The biggest sonic improvement since the creation of the CD!<br /><br />There are also some new words missing from previous releases<br /><br />*****************************************<br /><br />The most perfectly realized debut album in Rock history.<br /><br />I remember it as if it were yesterday. I saw him at Merriweather Post, we thought he was great, but few others did. The concert opened, the band was on stage tuning up without Morrison. After a half hour, the audience was restless and clapping to get Jim out. Suddenly Morrison appeared at the back, shirtless with leather pants and boots. He ran down the hundreds of steps. He hit the stage at full gallop and fell flat on his face. He moaned \\"ooooh\\". He moaned more. The other Doors tuned up while he moaned for minutes. A girl in the audience yelled \\"Why doesn't somebody help him??\\" Ray  Manzarek, the organist, put a microphone down near the groaning Morrison. The band  played a \\"da da da da da da DA\\" rhythm. Jim laid there, mouth open and moaned \\"oooooh\\". Suddenly the Lizard King shot up ten feet straight up in the air and screamed \\"Ohhhhh Yeah, I'm a Backdoor Man\\" while the band played that song...<br /><br /> We thought this one and Strange Days were the best albums ever done. Surprisingly enough, The Doors were NOT popular in their time. They had a few hits, Light my Fire, but they did not really achieve the status of Rock Gods until a decade or more after Morrison's death. Most kids thought they were too dark. Too negative.<br /><br />\\"What could we but perceived if the Doors of Perception were cleansed?\\" In the sixties a Rock song writer was not afraid to be literate. He had read Aldous Huxleys book on lysergic acid. He had also read William Blake's description of children in London at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution \\"Some are born to sweet delight, and some are born to the endless night\\". He listened to Kurt Weill/Bertold Brecht \\"Alabama Song\\" which, among other songs, got them kicked out of Nazi/Weimar Germany for being writing \\"degenerate\\" music in the 1930's. Jim Morrison, a product of Alexandria (Virginia's) George Washington High School, was nothing if not literate. (He wrote the lyrics for \\"Horse Latitudes\\", about the Spanish conquestadors ship captains tossing out horses to lighten the load when becalmed, as a junior in that High school, or so the story goes. His teacher was not impressed.)<br /><br />Yeah it's dark. It's visionary, like Baudelaire, I guess that's why the French like him so much they allowed him to be buried in Pere-Lechaise in Paris not that far from Oscar Wilde.<br /><br />Morrison was a poet, a visionary, a showman. He drank. He had many bad habits, but satanism was not one of them, he would be quite amused to hear that one! He loved the blues and has probably the best version of Willie Dixon's Back Door Man ever done, certainly the most sinister. But that was Morrison, he loved theater, he did things for effect.<br /><br />I think the Crystal Ship was probably closest to his heart. \\"The Crystal Ship is being filled, a thousand girls and thousand thrills, a million ways to spend your time...\\" Music full of nineteenth century, Romantic, Wagnerian Love-Death. Jim just wanted to float away on that Crystal Ship.<br /><br />I program out his theatrical over-the-top, acting-out, version of Oedipus Rex at \\"The End\\". You have some of the finest Rock music of all time. Listening to \\"The End\\" on a quality hifi will reveal there is a loud inarticulate scream, but later, in the newest release, there is some, umm, bad language bordering on the incestuous.He had read Aldous Huxleys book on lysergic acid.

0393072231|4.0|Michael Lewis' writing style may irritate some, but he is straightforward. One knows where he is coming from. He also can explain the complex financial deals based on, as he puts it, \\"crappy\\" mortgages, coming from home buyers who could not possibly continue their payments once those payments leave the \\"teaser rate.\\" On the one hand, this is a book about the disastrous economic disaster that started with the mortgage crisis. On the other hand, it is also a quirky examination of a handful of (often idiosyncratic) analysts who saw the train wreck coming.<br /><br />First, he details the complex financial instruments created by innovative experts. In essence, they took subprime mortgages, created bonds out of them, and ended up seeing these risky instruments rated (in quite a few cases) as very solid by Moody's and Standard and Poor. Thus, they became attractive for investors, given stellar ratings and the promise of good returns on the investment.<br /><br />Second, he notes a key problem? If the housing market didn't continue to see prices of housing increase, trouble would ensue. In addition, if those with mortgages could no longer make their payments, the house of cards would begin collapsing. The investment vehicles developed by large companies like UBS, Deutsch Bank, Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, and so on could become time bombs, waiting to explode.<br /><br />Third, there were those who, through their analysis, began to see the downside of this booming industry. Some of those coming to see the problems: Greg Lippman, Steve Eisman, Vincent Daniels, Charlie Ledley, Jamie Mai, Michael Burry, Danny Moses. . . .  Indeed, some analysts within the organizations selling the exotic instruments came to the same conclusion. In one case, one of these organizations' sales people were making lots of money selling the instruments--while an analyst elsewhere was \\"selling short\\" (betting that these instruments would collapse and generate large revenue upon their failure). This, of course, is the case with Goldman Sachs, which is in the news now precisely because of what looks like a company playing it both ways (although the likelihood is that Goldman probably didn't even understand this).<br /><br />Lewis' closing points make hard reading. He notes that the heads of the corporations that lost a fortune and helped tilt the US economy into a deep recession didn't understand the instruments and were largely unaware of the dangers ended up making a lot of money through golden parachutes, etc. The rating agencies were clueless, having underprepared analysts trying to rate instruments that they did not understand. Lewis does have an attitude here that can irritate some readers. But if you want a readable examination of what precipitated the economic meltdown, this is not a bad starting point., is the case with Goldman Sachs, which is in the news now precisely because of what looks like a company playing it both ways (although the likelihood is that Goldman probably didn't even understand this).

B00386EZJU|5.0|I loved the movie so much that I saw it twice, and the second time, especially, the music just got to me. It so beautifully accompanied this magical story of a boy and his dragon, two misfits, finding strength and courage through an unlikely friendship.    The music is GORGEOUS! Composer John Powell weaves such a spell with this CD, taking us from the wilds of a Viking village to the soaring heights of flying through the skies on a dragon's back.    Such delight! I cannot recommend it enough! Sure to thrill adventure-seekers of all ages!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|What a bunch of whiny babies. The absence of extra's on the Blu-ray is because the Bit-rate is so high that it took up all of the memory. This is as close to perfect Blu-ray as you can get. Sure there will be many versions down the line.<br />This one is just fine for what it is. \\"AVATAR\\" the movie. It was never intended to be a special edition. It's $19 which is well worth having this beautiful albiet plane version, to watch and enjoy. The rest of you get in line with the cry babies waiting for the \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" Special editions.

B002T9H2LK|5.0|If you haven't seen \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" you really don't know what you're missing. It is as humorous and tongue in cheek as Tarantino can be and is a very insteresting retelling (a very inventive one, by the way) of the end of the second world war.    The photography in this picture is probably my favorite of all Tarantino movies to date, the colors and the sensations they give are simply wonderful. The same goes for the score. And to all this you could also add the fact that the performances in this piece are genius, specially for our friend Cristoph Waltz who plays the Col. Hans Landa, and for which he won an Oscar.    The Special Edition has many goods to be worth the extra money you're paying for it. It also gives you the chance to have a digital copy (at least before december 31st of 2010) free of charge (15$ value).

B002ZFQD04|2.0|I have always liked Madonna-- and I recall her first \\"Like A Virgin\\" performance-- on TV- which, at that time, was a bit shocking.  She always gives 100% and she seems to here.  BUT- this DVD performance is so damn raw that the sensuality is lost.  The CD is pretty good because you don't see her with her legs splayed.  Not that there's anything wrong with that. (remember the line from a Seinfeld episode?)

B00337KM2S|4.0|First of all- my comment about this movie being a \\"Rorschach\\" test is in jest: top level, I found it very entertaining and enjoyable.    However, this movie can be a good conversation piece: discussing it with several folks, I was amazed by the diversity of their take on it and some of the unque interpretations. Like a multi-faceted diamond, folks can view it in many ways, and hence, perhaps reflect their own inner state of being.    One thing to highlight: some reviewers pointed out that they saw the \\"catch\\" coming a mile away and anyone who did not see it must be a PT BARNUM victim (i.e. \\"sucker born every minute\\"). I sincerely did not see it, and when I asked a handful of colleagues who also saw the emovie, they too admitted not seeing the twist coming.      Hmmm....like I said - this movie a \\"Rorschach\\" test.
B002UNMWAG|5.0|You can't really go wrong with the MacManus brothers. After waiting patiently so many years for the release of the 2nd film, I was almost in tears at the first death. Sean and Norman jumped back in their roles with ease and Billy Connolly was just the right element as ususal. Julie Benz was fabulous as the new detective in their lives. While nothing could beat the sure genius and intensity of the first film, I think this one comes as close as you can!! It leaves it open for a third, and I would be hopping and skipping to the theatre for it if it happens...I just hope we don't have to wait another 10 years! :)
0307271862|5.0|Henning Mankell's \\"The Man From Beijing\\" is a great mystery that should be studied in book-writing programs.      The story covers horrible murders in a remote Swedish village, history regarding the use of slave-labor to build the East-West Railroad in the American West, plans by the current Chinese government to colonize Zimbabwe and Mozambique, a trip by Chinese officials to said African countries, murders in Colorado and a Swedish trial judge hiding from an assassin in London.  The book covers a lot of territory and it does it very well.    This book goes at a fast clip and you run right along with it -- out of breath and wanting to find out what happens around the next bend.    Enjoy.
B002SF9YUM|5.0|I thought this film did an excellent job delving into the possibilities and mysteries of Dali's life and adventures. It was romantic and heart-breaking. Robert Pattinson did such an excellent job that after a few minutes I forgot all about \\"Edward\\". Javier Beltran was simply amazing and when the two are on screen together, their chemistry and portrayals completely wrap you up in their tale. If you're a Dali fan - I think you'll like it (if you care about life stories and not just looking at his work).

B00005OWEG|5.0|The Redux version with its 49 minutes of additional material is valuable as a further meditation by Coppola and Murch on their original work.  Both it and the original are great films, so there is no need to be picky.  In my judgment, the French plantation and Playboy Bunny scenes do not add a great deal to the original and the redux version is very, very long at 197 minutes.  Quibbles aside, AN remains an absolute stunner, worth the price of admission (or of the DVD) for Duvall's performance alone.  Or for the sound, which is monumental.
0553582038|1.0|i first came upon these books sometime in 2003. in 2006 i read 'feast for crows'. then waiting forever for 'a dance of dragons' ...    if readers knew that this series which started in 1997, would be prolonged forever, how many of them would have even started reading this series - paying money for them?     don't authors have a responsibility towards their readers?    to write three great books and then keep readers waiting forever (while the author pens other books) is dishonest in the extreme. there should a law against such chicanery.     publishing houses learning from robert jordan and george rr martin, should desist from publishing incomplete books. they should start publishing a series only when the author hands in the complete set.    and public should sue these authors and their publishing companies for making a fool of them.

B0039UTDFG|1.0|I agree completely with most of the other 1-star reviewers. However, let me emphasize that my single star is for the narration, not the photography. Like Planet Earth, the photography is breathtaking and some of the best HDTV material you will ever find.    I'm disgusted that the Discovery Channel has wasted money in re-narrating this Life series, just as they did with the Planet Earth series. And they must have wasted quite a bit of money to get Oprah Winfrey. They paid for \\"one of the most influential voices of our time\\", but actually got an inferior narration track for their money. And I'm not just talking about the tone of Oprah's voice or the odd rhythm of her sentences. The narration is Americanized and \\"dumbed down\\" so that as some reviewers noted, it seems like it is aimed at children. The children they are targeting would be much better off listening to Attenborough and stretching their vocabulary a bit. Actually, about the only slightly unfamiliar terms in the British version are those of the metric system, which is part of the language of science; all of us Americans would do well to finally become familiar with metric terms, and if you want to be a scientist or understand science, you must.    I also agree with others that the Discovery Channel's re-narration is an insult to Sir Attenborough who personifies this genre. It is difficult to put my finger on exactly what is so good about his narration, but it adds another dimension to the experience, while Oprah's distracts. And there is also the matter of the authenticity of the narrator: compare Sir Attenborough's 50+ years of experience as a naturalist to Oprah's shameless promotion of the paranormal, psychics, spiritualism, quack celebrity diets, past life regression and the poppycock of \\"The Secret\\".    I must say that while the photography of this new Life series is wonderful, I do prefer the organization and flow of the Planet Earth series. Furthermore, the Life series relies too much on slow motion photography; many scenes are shot ONLY in slow motion, so the viewer really has no idea what the behavior looks like in real time. In many cases it would be better to show a real-time sequence followed by a slow motion one in order to fully appreciate what the slo-mo shot reveals.      Still, I can't get enough of this type of material and have not been able to resist WATCHING it on the Discovery Channel. I suggest you do what I'm doing: turn down Oprah, put on \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", and enjoy the Life visuals now. Then, watch it all again when the BBC version is released; it won't hurt you a bit to watch this stuff twice. If you don't get the Discovery Channel, by all means wait and purchase the BBC blu-ray version.

Not only is the sound fantastic, but the original album is accompanied by pretty much EVERY single remix, b-side and rare track recorded by Astley around the time of his first album. Since Stock Aitken Waterman club mixes have been so hard to find on CD, this massive reissuing of both this album and the follow-up \\"Hold Me in Your Arms\\" is huge, because you get all the 12\\" remixes of all the singles.

B000K1P66W|5.0|The Four Agreements are a must have for anyone wanting a better perspective on themselves and other people.  It is all about what you process in your mind and how you react to what other people say or do.  The points outlined are so simple but make so much sense.  Of all the things that life is made up of, I am convinced there is nothing more important than our relationships.  This book is a very powerful tool.
B002ZG9968|2.0|\\"The Back-Up Plan\\" is an unbelievably bad movie, an over-the-top and hopelessly strained effort that's about as artificial as the method employed to impregnate Jennifer Lopez's character. Like so many that have come before it, including the cheerless \\"Baby Mama,\\" it takes a sincere and engaging idea, strips it of anything meaningful, and then jam-packs it with shrill comedy routines, some verbal, some slapstick, all of them completely unnecessary. This isn't to say that it couldn't be made funny, but it does need some degree of truth in it. There isn't a character, a situation, a location, or even a single line of dialogue that feels genuine - the plot is little more than an extended episode of a sitcom, one so hokey and manufactured that, at the end of its thirty-minute timeslot, all has miraculously been resolved.    The plot: Lopez plays Zoe, a New York City pet shop owner who, after years of not finding Mr. Right and starting a family, decides to take matters into her own hands and get herself artificially inseminated. Her simple plan becomes complicated after meeting Stan (Alex O'Loughlin), a handsome dairy farmer who sells his own homemade goat cheeses at farmers markets; the two instantly fall in love, although she has yet to tell him that she has been trying to get pregnant. Once she finally does become pregnant, it takes her even longer to admit it to him. Needless to say, he's more than a little shocked when the truth is finally revealed. Up until now, he had never thought beyond meeting someone and forming a relationship.    The rest of the film is spent on Stan trying to cope with imminent fatherhood, Zoe getting past her deep-seeded trust issues, and both fretting over an uncertain future. In this sense, \\"The Back-Up Plan\\" is no better than the plethora of romantic comedies released annually, going for all the obvious jokes that have absolutely no basis in reality. Consider a moment early in the film, when Zoe arrives at Stan's farm; as she drives along, she notices that he's helming a tractor without a shirt on, and this distracts her so badly that she plows into a tree. Never mind the fact that we know she's pregnant at this point - for the filmmakers, it's only about the humor in losing control and damaging a car. Perhaps it was one of those situations where it was so funny that I forgot to laugh.    We're also treated to a number of tired, unoriginal pregnancy jokes, which cover everything from spontaneous vomiting to constant food cravings to weight gain to that fateful moment when the water breaks and everyone within range slips and falls. We're also given a few unexpected jokes, such as the sight of blood on the gloved hand of Robert Kline, whose character frequently examines Zoe. Did I miss something here? Is this funny just by virtue of the fact that it's blood? Or is it because, soon after seeing the doctor's hand, Stan dramatically collapses in yet another display of overused pregnancy humor? A scene like this is a deep mystery, begging the question of what audience is expected to find it entertaining.    And then there the women of a single moms club, which Zoe is nearly voted out of simply because Stan has entered her life. They're all little more than broad comic caricatures, displaying not the slightest hint of authenticity, believability, or subtlety. They take part in a waterlogged birthing scene that truly does reach a new level of sheer comic desperation - as the leader bangs on a drum and chants, the mother-to-be sloshes around a plastic swimming pool, moaning as if she were channeling both an orca and a sheep, screaming at Zoe to stay where she is because she's her focal point, ordering Stan to fetch her a mirror so that she can see the baby's head emerging. This is probably the least funny scene of any movie released this year. Or last year. Or the year before that.    I'm still shaking my head in amazement. What were the filmmakers thinking? What were the actors thinking? Who believed that making this was a good idea? \\"The Back-Up Plan\\" is a movie of astonishingly little depth, plausibility, insight, and humor, although I suspect it might have been halfway amusing as a five-minute variety-show skit. Alas, it's just over 100 minutes, which is to say that every joke is either needlessly stretched out or terribly out of place. The former includes a cameo appearance by Anthony Anderson as a worn out, wisecracking playground dad, who both frightens and inspires Stan, and who doesn't know what to make of the substance his son dug out of the sandbox. The latter includes Zoe's dog, which lost the use of its hind legs and now uses a doggie wheelchair to pull itself along. This might have worked had the poor thing not been a tool for a series of shallow I-want-to-eat-people-food-and-chew-on-your-pregnancy-test gags. The only back-up plan this movie should have followed was not getting made.
B0033G9OFA|1.0|The Doors have spent years finding new ways to re-package and re-sell the same basic songs from their six studio albums. Now they have a new excuse for yet another release, a documentary about the history of the band which of course opens the door for a \\"soundtrack.\\"<br /><br />The album for \\"When You're Strange\\" is basically the same recordings a Doors fanatic or casual classic rock listener probably already has in earlier releases, such as the much superior \\"The Very Best Of The Doors\\" and of course, the albums themselves. For die hard members of the Jim Morrison cult the only noteworthy new material here are the poetry readings by actor Johnny Depp (who narrates the film), most of them only last a few seconds, but does that matter to Morrison's disciples? It is a shame though, how short the poetry tracks are, because Depp's voice adds a nice, dark atmosphere to the words, like a fellow literary rebel reciting strange visions and ideas.<br /><br />The other \\"new\\" material here are \\"live tracks\\" basically lifted from TV performances such as the notorious \\"Light My Fire\\" performance from the Ed Sullivan Show and a scorching \\"When The Music's Over\\" from European TV. But the quality of these tracks is so scratchy and fuzzy that you're better off with the actual performance footage found in Doors DVD releases which have much cleaner audio. The Doors fanatic will no doubt want to get them just for the sake of having them but the casual listener will find little reason for adding the recordings to their iPods. The same goes for the \\"interview clips\\" featuring the band, short clips which, again, are simply lifted from video sources most fans purchased long ago.<br /><br />The music of The Doors is of course classic, powerful and timeless. Songs like \\"Moonlight Drive\\" and \\"People Are Strane\\" retain their dark, poetic power while \\"Break On Through\\" and \\"Soul Kitchen\\" are exciting numbers with killer rhythms. The beautiful \\"The Crystal Ship\\" is here as well with its wonderous visions and lush melodies and \\"The End\\" remains the band's epic masterpiece. But of course anyone who loves The Doors already knows all this. And those who loved 2007's remixed albums will find the original recordings which of course, they probably already own.<br /><br />Some are saying that criticisms of this release are unfounded because hey, it is a SOUNDTRACK to a film after all. True, but reviewed as a product, it has little to offer Doors fans and for the newly initiated, they are better off getting the band's albums which are the true testament of any musical group. Wouldn't a new fan prefer the actual studio versions of \\"Light My Fire\\" and \\"When The Music's Over\\" anyway? \\"When You're Strange\\" is no doubt a fascinating film, but as a soundtrack, it's just more recycled product which you probably already have sitting somewhere in your CD collection or downloaded into your iPod.odies and \\"The End\\" remains the band's epic masterpiece.

0140311254|3.0|Although this script tells a shortened version of Dahl's great classic it has become too simple. I bought this script with the intentions of using it for a Secondary School production using pupils aged 11-16. After reading it through I realised the script was far more suited to younger children. Its clear though that it has been adapted to suit a cast of about 20+ (Including Oompa Loompas) by allowing extra parents to accompany the ticket holders into the factory.    Personally I'm going to use small sections of the script alongside some sections of the film. (The first version, as I preferred it and it is available online if you google it) I'll also probably adapt some sections from the book.    I would however commend the writer for providing scenery, prop and costume advice in a section at the back of this book.    If you want an easy production with young children then go ahead and buy this script. I would especially reccomend this option to anyone who would need the extra advice in the back about staging and scenery. If you want something a little closer to the book you might be better off adapting your own. A lot of extra work I know, but far more worth it... cheaper.. and you wouldn't have to worry so much about paying for the rights etc to put it on.
0446563048|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book for the following reasons (I have too many to list them all):<br /><br />. The Business Sandbox: Growing up, Tony started all kinds of businesses. He learned to deal with setbacks early in his career. I get the impression that Tony was playing business in a big sandbox (although he does not use this metaphor) which allowed him to be very creative and to experiment. I think some of the skills he learned in the experimental sandbox of business prepared him well for managing an internet business with no pre set rules. I learned quite a bit about how he went about it. It also highlights the importance for kids to create and experiment.<br /><br />. I enjoyed reading about how he used creativity to make money.<br /><br />. The book is filled with business wisdoms such as these ones: \\"If you don't know what to do, at least know what not to do\\" and that one \\"If you don't care what the outcome is, you are in a better negotiating position\\". And many more.<br /><br />. Tony emphasizes the importance of chasing your passion and not so much so the money. I got the feeling that Tony transitionned more towards passion and happiness as he matured as a businessman.<br /><br />. Tony says \\"Looking back, a lot of our growth happened that way. We'd just throw ideas against the wall to see if they's stick, improvise and make it happens\\". That is how the internet works. If you are into the hard rules business books, you might be disappointed with this one. If not, you will enjoy his work.<br /><br />. The first sentence in the section - Incubator - is a keeper.<br /><br />. I learned a ton about culture and better ways to achieve employee motivation.<br /><br />. I thought Tony entered into the Amazon.com transaction because he had made plenty of $ and it was time for him to get out. Nothing could be further from the truth. Great story!<br /><br />. About Happiness? I don't want to spoil this. All I can say is that I am joining Tony's movement.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|Natalie Merchant is a master at adapting children's poetry to music.  She transforms poems that are great in their own right and adds her vision and style to it, she adds different styles of music in the album, songs that'll make you shake your shoulders and songs of solace.  I highly recommend this album.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|The BD/DVD showed up this morning. Wasn't overly impressed with the packaging but not too bad either. Popped the Bluray disc in my PS3 which took some surprisingly extra time to start. Once the movie began, the picture and sound just blew the socks off. The rumbling of the planes, waterfall, and Pandora are all phenomenal. The picture is life like. Don't trust the critics. If you want to enjoy a good movie this weekend, you can't go wrong with a movie of this caliber for 20 bucks.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Avatar is simply a masterpiece, superb in all departments: storyline, photography, acting, special effects, message, you name it. This is a work of science fiction stepping a bit in fantasy and mysticism, developed in the tradition of the good old sci-fi masters. As for the SFX, instantly became a landmark in SFX, impressive the way Cameron improved CGI technology to reflect the real actor facial expressions in the CGI characters, and also the seamless interaction of CGI characters with real actors. The beauty and quality of the landscapes is spectacular. Avatar really took CGI to the next level.<br /><br />Other key highlight of the movie is how Cameron managed to smoothly deliver an environmental message that effectively raises public awareness in a universal way. Here you might think of the Spaniards discovering and exploiting the Americas, or European countries colonizing African countries, or the U.S. army fighting the Indian tribes, or ...<br /><br />Despite their completely opposite approaches, Avatar and [[ASIN:B002SJIO5E District 9 ]] are strong candidates to become the two best science fiction films of the abundant 2009 crop.
B001UJ6IJC|3.0|This is one of my all time favorite novels in my collection. The audiobook, not so much.<br /><br />I've read the novel version of \\"World War Z\\" and found it to be much better than the audiobook version. While the voice acting is good (especially the oratories by Mark Hamill and Rob Reiner) the audio version lacks so much from the book that sometimes leaves the listener/reader stumped. In the interview with character Joe Muhammad, a wheelchair bound man and part of a civil patrol unit, he mentions the drug PHALANX which was a big part of the original African Rabies scare in the early part of the war. Another narrative mentions the death of a heart surgeon, a very important part of the book, and it's missing! Without all the various stories, some more compelling than the ones listed in the audiobook, you miss out on the 'big picture' the 'whole story'.<br /><br />All in all, WWZ is a good audiobook for the money. However if you want the whole story and don't want to miss out on the far better content not mentioned, get the book. Or in my case, get both!
0440243688|3.0|I read one of the Reacher books, I think the first one, a long time ago. I don't remember anything about it, beyond that I wasn't really impressed with the character or the plot. However, I saw this in a supermarket, 40% off, and the guy seems popular, so I picked it up. I can't say I expected much, so I wasn't really disappointed. At times it's not a bad book, and if nothing else the author keeps things moving right along, but it's also not particularly well-thought-out, plot-wise, and parts of it are just dumb.    So our hero, Jack Reacher, is riding a subway car in New York City. Reacher's the sort of hero I hadn't heard of in the past. He's the ultimate loner, no friends, acquaintances, or living relatives. No home, car, luggage, or accouterments other than an ATM card. He seemingly doesn't even own a pocket knife. We're never told why he's so rootless; there's no discussion (at least in this book) of how he came to live like this. He just wanders in from stage left and starts intervening in the situation. He sees a woman acting strangely, decides she's a menace because, back when he worked as an MP in the U.S. Army, he was trained in how to spot suicide bombers, and she's acting like one. Now it's the wrong time for a suicide bomber to make an attack (the middle of the night) so Reacher decides to just intervene and see if he can talk her out of it. Instead, it turns out she has a gun rather than a bomb, and after talking with him briefly, she shoots herself.    Naturally, Reacher decides he needs to investigate and figure out why she did this. And naturally, there's a lot more to it than just a depressed woman committing suicide because her life is drab. I won't ruin the plot for you by recounting all of the plot twists to you; that would be telling. But I will say that at times it's very improbable. There are characters masquerading as people for whom it's improbable they could pass for. At one point, someone, a professional tough guy, gives Reacher a gun with which he's supposed to shoot beaucoup bad guys, we're talking a dozen and a half. So the tough guy gives him a submachinegun (which makes sense) and *one* magazine of ammunition! Who does that? If you're going to give him that small amount of ammunition, you should just give him a pistol and a couple mags, it's much less bulky, and perfectly legal. The only reason to have a submachinegun would be so you could fire bursts---and that empties the magazine quickly. It's easy enough to change the magazine, and you can carry several...but the guy only gives Reacher one, and chides him later for burning up all the ammunition firing bursts.    Not the worst suspense novel I ever read, but certainly not the best either. If you like the series, you can perhaps judge from what I wrote above whether it's in line with the rest of what he's written. If not, well, look over my other reviews. There are a lot of books I've enjoyed more.
0451203933|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  Great writing + great story = a book you can't put down.    On top of all of that, it's non-fiction.  You actually learn someting while being thoroughly entertained.
B002NXSRVG|2.0|I had very high expectations for this movie, especially since it was highly recommended by my younger brother. I have to say, it did not meet my expectations and it was a poorly excuted movie to be honest.  the biggest problem with it, was the poor character development, they really failed to build up solid characters. and i felt lost between all those characters whom i know nothing about and eventually not caring about any.  the plot was simple. but nothing special.  the other problem was the dialogue, this movie had one of the worst dialogues ever, was really boring and not intersting at all.  having said that, i must admit that the action scenes and special effects were stunning at times, i especially enjoyed the street chase scene in Paris. but once the action stopped, the movie dragged and seemed boring and slow.  I can see why some might give this 5 stars or find it entertaining, but in summary, i found it boring and worth only 2 stars for the mighty action scenes alone. a poorly excuted movie.
B000GCFO08|5.0|Very faithful to the series even goes as far as using the music from the game by the same music producer. Original characters made for the movie that are similar to the characters in the game without having to be repetitive. Good plot overall and very terrifying moments where you can sympathize with the main characters and also has an ending that will leave you with an empty feeling in your stomach.    Silent Hill the movie rocks and is til this day one of my fav horror movies.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Great movie, have watched it two times now, and plan on watching it again, and again.  Would really like to meet this woman that did all of this, just fantastic. And Sandra Bullock was just wonderful, one of her best.
0385504225|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this latest Dan Brown book. Even though the \\"formula\\" is the same as his previous two thrillers, I found the exploration of the Freemasons and D.C. setting intriguing. The characters are complex and kept me guessing \\"who REALLY done it\\". Probing into the God/human relationship was enlightening as well as the the study of Noetic Science. I say READ IT!
B002ZCDR88|2.0|i am a pretty big natalie merchant fan (i like her songs), although i've never seen her live and i don't keep up with her life outside of her music. so, i had no idea that she was working on this project for so long. i thought she had just retired or something, and that was why she hadn't made any new music in so long. anyway, this album came as a surprise to me, and i was very eager to hear it - especially after reading all of the 5 star reviews here on amazon. needless to say, i was disappointed with what i heard.<br /><br />having read the reviews, it seems that she did a lot of research and put a lot of time into making this album and some accompanying 80 page booklet. i downloaded the album, so i didn't get the booklet and i must say that it is just fine for me to not read it. frankly, i don't think that good music should require an 80 page accompanying booklet to explain the behind-the-scenes labor. in fact, i can say that considering the amount of time that went into \\"research\\" and booklet making in producing this album, the whole thing sounds more like a thesis for a musicology program rather than an album by natalie merchant. another reviewer mentioned the word \\"contrived\\" as a way of describing the sound of this album, and was excoriated by zealous fans in the comments section. i can see what the reviewer means, though: the music on this album lacks passion. her voice is beautiful, of course, but to my ears, she fails to make the songs hers. the search for just the right poems to accompany just the right songs laced with elements of music from different regions of the world seems to have robbed ms. merchant of the raw power of passionate art. the singing is formulaic and boring. it's like she is parodying how she is supposed to sound. of course, it is not easy to put ones finger on exactly what it is that one does not like about technically proficient music, which this certainly is. so, i don't begrudge anyone the right to enjoy this album. but for me, a long-time admirer and fan of natalie merchant, this music seems to lack soul and spontaneous artistic power, which is something i appreciate in music, in favor of a deliberate attempt to portray worldliness? learnedness? i dont know... to that end, i agree with the 1 star reviewer who said the music sounds contrived. i would add to that, though, and say that it also sounds kind of cheesy, like something i would be embarrassed to recommend to a friend.e admirer and fan of natalie merchant, this music seems to lack soul and spontaneous artistic power, which is something i appreciate in music, in favor of a deliberate attempt to portray worldliness? learnedness? i dont know... to that end, i agree with the 1 star reviewer who said the music sounds contrived. i would add to that, though, and say that it also sounds kind of cheesy, like something i would be embarrassed to recommend to a friend.
B0037AGASG|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2Y3WWUZ37DQ34]]This video is the review of Justin Bieber's latest album, My World 2.0. The album is a remarkable effort by a 16 year old.

So please feel free to check out this video!
B00005JLCI|4.0|I purchased this to help my son who has significant learning disablities comprehend this English assignment.  It helps his comprehension to have a visual aid.  We also used SparkNotes \\"No Fear Shakespeare\\" and their srudy guide.  The combination of the three made this comprehensable for him.  The movie alone without the other two would have been difficult to understand with the Shakespearean language.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|This is an interesting movie.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|I never watch at iMAX (3-D), I almost certainly it is a hyped-up movie, since they spent so much money in making, I was right.  Decided to wait until it was released on Blu-Ray/DVD, just got my copy delivered late by UPS last night just before 8PM via Amazon, watch the entire movie on Blu-Ray.  I have a feeling they release it too quickly that means the movie isn't that great only 4 Months since the theater. \\"Titanic\\" was longer before they released and I think way better than this movie.  Like a lot Sci-Fi, but this movie didn't impresses me much. Pretty confusing a disabled vet went into this soul transformation into an Avatar body or actually get to another planet with this suit?  The computer graphics is not too realistic, obviously can tell it is computer generates, compare to this week's release \\"The Lovely Bones\\" have much beautier computer graphics animation, I think cost less to make and better. Borrow from a family, friend, to see if you like first, before buying, there's two additional version of this movie to release.
B002VPE1AW|4.0|Avatar may be the best movie I have ever seen in my life. I don't even mind the somewhat derivative plot---in fact, I actually like stories about underdogs fighting imperialist bullies. Make the underdogs exotic tribal warriors, the bullies space marines, add a bunch of prehistoric-looking animals, and set it in a gorgeous jungle setting, and you have an awesome movie.    What prevents me from giving this DVD 5 stars is the special features---or rather, the complete lack of them. Other than basic setup stuff and the movie itself, this DVD has nothing on it. I would have at least appreciated a director's commentary.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|After reading the negative reviews of this movie, I felt compelled to re-list my own review. Obviously people aren't getting the message. This movie is reminiscent - obviously - of what we Cherokee endured. I actually wept many times while watching it, knowing the parallels hidden within, perhaps overlooked by those not \\"Native American\\". The action, CG, technical effects and acting - all have depth and subtle, underlying meaning - especially in the scientific and military crews. If you're a CG appreciator, go for it - purchase this movie. There's more to it though, but the effects are astonishing. So now, risking cyber-throttling for my diatribe to come, here goes. Just take into consideration that people have different reasons for enjoying movies, and their consequent value. Not only is this an important movie, it may awaken all who see it - including some Human Beings - so many whom have slept in apparent complacency - for so long, side by side with those who attempted to slaughter us all not too long ago - and for the same reasons depicted in this remarkable movie. Resources. Land. Greed. Should this happen? Should we awaken? It is inevitable. Just as the travelers experienced a long sleep prior to reaching their destination, this analogy was not lost on me. I've noticed a few comment mentions indicating \\"Native American\\" likenesses, but decided to expand the obvious nature I perceived - as well as many friends. We saw it clearly from the beginning. So, in order to assist understanding from this viewpoint, here goes. Our oldest Cherokee authenticated \\"city\\" has been dated at over 5,000 years. This was a major trading center, there were many more. We have learned to be patient, and learned it well, most recently by the terrible things done to us - truly genocide. In order for Euros to own land, resources and people - we learned the reality of who is empowered here - then and now. Impossible not to recognize in this film, this correlation. At the least the earth would be protected once again if Cherokee and all our Native Nations had the opportunity for legitimate governmental input - this movie merely condenses the action, bringing to fore the tranquil previous lives on Pandora - and like us, thanking wildlife for giving their lives in order to sustain ours. Could something \\"real\\" like this happen here? Yep. It could. However, knowing what we do for sustenance in this would require research and time....something people don't have these days, in this economy, with required two income households, ninety+ hour work weeks, etc. I suppose one must truly want to learn how to feed their families if there weren't grocery stores, but there is nothing available in these stores able to surpass the nectar of ripe blackberries picked from a wild bush or the satisfaction of eating a personally tended tomato while standing in your own garden, its juices running down your arm. The Indiginous beings inhabiting Pandora were working with their unique planet, relishing its fruits - so well depicted by Jake's Avatar - and something we Cherokee still enjoy right now, right here, today. That's how Native cultures survived here for centuries. Yes, it would be difficult to the extreme for most to live that way; the required change in lifestyles. Not for us, however. At the worst? People will not exist here in the US from whence we \\"Native Americans\\" came - and continue to come, albeit with quite different lifestyles for most, yet I believe Human Beings would flourish once again if we were forced to return to the old ways. Well, not so very old. In this movie? The indiginous humanoids were knowledgable, working with and enjoying the bounty of their planet. They are Human Beings in this film. Only \\"Native American\\" readers will understand what I mean. We will continue to survive, for we know how. I realize this may be perceived as nonsense by many readers. Know this and make no mistake: we teach Our Own our way, and the crucial importance of balancewithin the earth wherever we live, (it would surprise you all) however we may appear - the blond guy with blue eyes and an Irish name in the next cubicle may be Indian. Yes, I said Indian. This politically correct nonsense makes little sense to my clan. Indian = indiginous, shortened to Indian all over the world. We frequently recognize Our Own, just as depicted by the female shaman in this movie. The Earth is the main thing to protect as was Pandora...protect it, and it shall feed and protect us who continue living; understand the sad truth that we, here, not only in the US but globally, are on the edge of the abyss. This is the most profound depiction in movie form I have seen reflecting this fact to date, CG, special effects, well fleshed-out characters and all. I have watched many movies, and noticed their changes along with the times. These are strange days. Recently, movies began to reflect current horrors - real horrors, not only to us Indians, but to us all - and in incredibly intelligent formats. I wonder who will live? I wonder who will flourish? Watch the movie. Our journey, again, is much the same, regardless of the format amd plot. Awaken. This movie, when watched in this manner may open your eyes...allowing folks to become much more cognizant here in the US especially - and those who haven't, to wake up. This I hope. This we hope. This we shall work toward, for it is the only way. We lived, we endured, in spite of the odds. We learned. Just as the Avatars did. All Cherokee didn't see the humor in relocation and the consequent Trail of Tears. And registration? Further removal of our freedom by shedding our blood via lies in hope of killing us off completely? Schools which included nothing of our own history? Incomprehensible. Unacceptable. We did not all go. We, of my clan did not go. Research what I write. You may learn something amazing. Try the keyword Yahoo Falls, see the last recognized atrocity - certainly, there have been many, many others - this, a minor one in Euro eyes, and then weep yourselves. Heart-breaking, it is forever remembered by us, passed down to our children - who made up the majority of lives taken at Yahoo Falls on their journey to safety, so they thought. Killing children. This is not our way. However, it is the way accomplished in so many fashions by Big Corporation - the true government - here and globally - as well as on Pandora. This is an important addition to anyone and everyone's film library, should be protected, and utilized as an unique learning tool. It is worthy. Let us not revisit the past, but learn from it by whatever means grace us all - i.e., this movie, any genius medium which brings history and possibility to light, research on the 'net - however you can learn about the reality of these strange days. History repeats itself. Perhaps this was an intentional attempt by Cameron to enlighten folks...who knows what motivation pushes some? We who were here before shall continue our attempts to live peacefully on and of these lands. Should peace be an impossibility? We shall do exactly what we did in WW II, and that was the right thing at that time. But, let's not get into these war and nuclear issues - we hope there will never be another bomb. Anywhere. If only a single pair of eyes open via the effects on folks from this incredible movie, that's a wonderful thing. Like the indigenous inhabitants of Pandora, we hope for the best - and handle the worst. Here and now, we hope those in government positions cease to speak out of the side of their mouths. Money and greed? They have no home. We Indians shall live on, for Human Beings are graced with a Home, an eternal one - we hope - Earth. Pandora's Human Beings lived that way. And they fought well, with Honor. Enough about our reality. See this film, and try to learn from it in ways more than how impressive its CG effects are or the entertainment value, or what tiny mistakes there may be - if any. I don't see any - but some viewersdo. Regardless, this is worth the investment - purchase the DVD or Blu-ray. See it on Video on Demand. You will not regret it. As far as waiting for the additional releases? Heck, I'll purchase them all. Thanks for reading my lengthy comment. I welcome any replies. Anyone who doesn't understand the parallel between the \\"blue people\\" and us Indians? I will happily describe the historical likenesses in great detail. Be well - everyone., a minor one in Euro eyes, and then weep yourselves. Heart-breaking, it is forever remembered by us, passed down to our children - who made up the majority of lives taken at Yahoo Falls on their journey to safety, so they thought. Killing children.

I don't see any - but some viewersdo. Regardless, this is worth the investment - purchase the DVD or Blu-ray. See it on Video on Demand. You will not regret it. As far as waiting for the additional releases? Heck, I'll purchase them all. Thanks for reading my lengthy comment. I welcome any replies. Anyone who doesn't understand the parallel between the \\"blue people\\" and us Indians? I will happily describe the historical likenesses in great detail. Be well - everyone.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|You can look at other reviews for info about themovie since so many have already.    I loved the movie and seen it many times in theaters. However, when my friend bought this movie and we wtched it on DVD we were shocked. Not only are there no extras, there were MISSING SCENES. There were some scenes in the movie that were not on the dvd version. I heard that another version will come out that will include new scenes and footage and the extras and the 3D version, but you ave to wait till the end of the year to even 2011.     Now i dont really care about having it in 3D or not but i want the extras and not have missing scenes. and i hate how these movie companies are releasing a crappy version first then a special later just to get your money. just do it like they used to and have all versions out t the same time. im waiting to buy this movie because im not going to pay for it twice.    I suggest that if you havnt bought it yet that you wait for the real versions. If you already bought it well hope you can return it or sell it and get the better version.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|Great movie, great price on Amazon. It's $20 - $40 less than I paid to see it in IMAX 3d with my family. Believe it or not, there's a lot of people who don't give a lick about 'extra features' though I did knock it down 1 star due to a lack of features, but not 4! Fantastic sound, flawless BR production. This makes Star Trek look like VHS! Between now and Christmas, I'm pretty sure I can get another $40 up for Ultimate. Until then, I'll watch this a few times and enjoy every second of it. So should you.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|I am extremely disappointed James Cameron and the studio decided to release this movie with NO SPECIAL FEATURES AT ALL!!!!!  There isn't even any previews of other movies.  JUST the movie.  When I pre-ordered this Blu-Ray I was excited to be able to see it again.  I had a lot of mixed emotions when I saw it in the theater (in Imax-3D).  The 3D technology was incredible. I enjoyed the movie from an entertainment stand point but was a little put off by the 'way to easy' references to the Green movement and the plight of the American Indians.  Not that he referenced these points, but by how obvious and sometimes cheesy these references were... 'Unobtainium'? Well the more I thought about the movie later the more I liked it in my mind.  So I was looking forward to getting it on Blu-Ray and especially to see the extras.  I was VERY eagerly waiting to see a making of documentary since Cameron basically took the relatively new technology of motion capture to the N'th degree and beyond.   But, alas, NOTHING.  I was very upset when I got home, put it in the Blu-Ray player and found no special features listed.  Then I came to Amazon and read some reviews and found out they are releasing a new edition in November with all the features I think everyone was expecting.  Too bad James Cameron didn't seem to make enough money two of the highest grossing films of all time that he had to dupe us into buying this nearly worthless edition by not letting it be known ahead of time that there would be a second edition.  Now, if I am not too mad still in November, I will have to buy the NEW edition to see the making of I have been waiting for.  Besides if he was so conscious of the environmental impact, he would realize that he is going to create a lot of plastic cases that may end up in the landfills. Because, let's face it, who will want this edition when the new one comes out?
B002C1BHJ8|5.0|The cable seems to be of high quality materials, the price was about half of what I would pay in a store and it definitely works well.
B002VPE1AW|2.0|I put in this dvd,and WOW!!! what cool effects,cool colors,well cool everything.After the movie was over,my first reaction was anger.After thinking about it,I was just plain sad.Once again Hollywood took what could have been a cool concept,great ideas,and a pretty good story,and turned it into...The evil corperation,the horrable armed forces.All headed up by the worst thing to ever exist,not only on the face of the earth,but the whole solar system.The dreaded white male.This movie went even further than 2012 with the writers liberal views.Hollywood!WHY? can you not make a really cool product,entertain us,and leave your personel hate for a little over 50% of Americans out of it.A movie I could have enjoyed several times,Trashed.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I've read the other reviews saying avoid this title because another version is on the way...in November.  Well do that and you are missing out on the finest blue ray disc ever made.  The color and detail are stunning and this will truly show off the power of your BD player and HDTV.  This is one to show off to your friends for sure.  I've never seen a blue ray look even close to this good.  I own over a 100 BD's myself, and have rented dozens more.  The closest I can think of is Speed Racer.  Also the audio is phenomenal!  Have you seen Iron Man or Rambo on BD?  This is better than both of those.  The only disc that I've seen with better audio is probably the LOTR collection.  But seriously, do yourself a favor and BUY THIS NOW!  You will not be disappointed.  Plus, if you are a true fan you'll probably go out and get the Ultimate Edition and the 3D version when they come out.  But for now, pick this up, pop it in your player, turn up the volume and be blown away.
0393072231|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone who has been involved with the mortgage business or the MBS business over the last decade.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I read everyone's review about how this blu-ray version doesn't include all the bells & whistles of most new releases especially the 3D version. But i decided to buy it anyway. Let me tell you that you won't be disappointed. If you have a true high def TV (decent size) then it is all worth it. The colors are amazing & the clarity is just unbelievable. I didn't get to see this in theaters so maybe that adds a little more to my viewing experience on my 52\\" TV. In my opinion, the 3D version would be too much. My eyeballs were constantly moving trying to capture everything on my screen. As for the extras that are not included in this (menu goes straight to movie menu where there are not many options), who really watches those anyway. I know out of all the movies I own maybe a handful have I actually watched any of those extras & they usually aren't anything special. Buy this version & you won't be disappointed!!!
B002QGUFWE|1.0|This CD is a complete waste of plastic, and has about as much value.  The songs are the same sort of banal pop junk heard by all the 15-minutes-of-fame media-hyped no-talent media queens.  I wish I'd never bought this garbage; so many musicians with talent deserve the money.  Please learn from my mistake, preview these songs and don't buy the hype that is gaga; support talented musicians instead of this trash.
B001PPLIEG|2.0|Although Quantum of Solace starts where Casino Royale left off, this Bond film does not hold its own with the earlier movie.  Daniel Craig is back as Bond, and if it weren't for him and Judi Dench as M, this movie would have been a complete waste.<br /><br />In this film, Bond is out of control and angry because of what happened in Casino Royale.  M is deeply worried about his behavior and whether she can trust him as an agent.  As Bond pursues the connections behind an assassination attempt on M, he uncovers Dominic Greene, a weaselly entrepreneur who seems on the surface to be a protector of the environment when, really, he has more devious plans.  The violence here seems too set up, as though the screenwriters wanted to dispense entirely with real plot and instead string together some really cool explosions and chase scenes.  Let's fact it:  those action scenes are only exciting when you care about what is happening.  Or you can tell what's happening.  If Casino Royale lost focus for ten minutes or so near the end, this one has hardly any focus at all.  It seems as though it ended several times over.<br /><br />That's not to say that the film is terrible.  Lackluster would be a better word.  Bond aficionados should see it just to complete the viewing experience, especially since the current rights holders seem determined to build more of a Bond history, one film after the next.  Daniel Craig remains one of my favorite Bonds -- gritty and flawed and whip-smart.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I'm another one of the guys who was driving his wife crazy with loud video game volume, plus I've begun to play more online co-op type games that require mics to communicate with other players, so I decided it was time to find a good quality headset. I was surprised to find so few options outside the bluetooth mono ear piece things - and when I came across the P21 headset I was turned off after reading so many complaints about the \\"hissing\\" sound. But then Turtle Beach announced the new PX21 model, which is strangely posted on the same Amazon web page as the previous model - even retaining the feedback specifically relating to the older model...? Anyway, I read that there were some sound improvements on the new model and I assumed the first sound fix would be the \\"hissing\\" sound so I ordered a pair. Well, to cut to the chase, the hissing sound is still present in the new model - but I have to say, after using them now for several weeks, the hissing sound is not a problem. I only hear it when there is no other sounds coming through, like when the game is loading... Once the action starts - the hissing is gone completely and all I hear are the game sounds. For those of you old enough to remember cassette tape players - the hissing sound reminds me of the noise you used to hear when a tape played and there was a silent spot - once the music starts the hissing was gone and all you heard was the sound of music. Speaking of sound - I am happy to report the sound quality is outstanding, granted I'm no audiophile - but I do have 2 perfectly functioning ears with 36 years of hearing experience. The mic works great too - people can hear me loud and clear and I hear others in BOTH ears - no annoying static filled mono bluetooth ear piece that you have to charge every hour. Also another great feature with the mic is that you can mute the volume - which is awesome when there is some annoying person who won't shut up. And muting the mic doesn't affect the game volume which you still hear in full effect. Regarding installing the headset to your PS3, I found a very easy solution that I was surprised to not see anyone else suggest. There are two simple cords that extend out of the headset - one is the USB that plugs directly into the PS3 - and the second is a mini 3.5 mm stereo cable - which I simply inserted into a 6.3mm stereo plug adapter ($3.65 on Amazon) and plugged that into my stereo receiver's 6.3mm stereo headphone out jack, and done - no need to mess with piggy-back RCA audio cables, etc. This worked for me because my PS3, TV, and Cable box are all connected thru my receiver and so the sound is already set to go out the headphone out jack. Obviously if you don't have a receiver and just connect your PS3 directly to your TV you will have to use the more complicated set-up procedure as outlined in the instructions. Regarding the comfort - these are ok - there is plenty of padding around the ear muffs, my only complaint is that the muffs aren't very deep - only like 1/4 of an inch - so my ears literally get pressed against the inner part of the headphones. This isn't terrible since there is a lot of cushioning in this area too - but after a while (1-2 hours in my case) the pressure on my ears starts to become noticeable and feels uncomfortable. But not so much so that I feel the need to remove them - just a little irritating... In conclusion, I would rate these a 4 out of 5 stars - they are not perfect - but very capable and acceptable for PS3 gaming.
B002VECM6S|4.0|I'm not a fan of sappy, feel-good movies, but everyone kept telling me that I had to see The Blind Side.  So I did, and I was prepared to hate it.  To my surprise, director John Lee Hancock manages, for the most part, to skirt sentimentality for a (relatively) no-nonsense story of a homeless African-American teenager who is adopted by a fireball of a Southern woman and her family.  Yes, there are the obligatory teary moments, but fortunately, most of the film marches on as Leigh Anne Tuohy herself does, with purpose and determination and not much time to linger over emotions.<br /><br />First, the plot:  this is the story of NFL left tackle Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) as told through the point-of-view of his adoptive mother, Leigh Anne Tuohy, a Southern belle with grits.  Young Oher, the abandoned child of a crack addict from the projects, ends up at the private Wingate Christian School through the fluke of happening to temporarily live with the school's janitor who wants his own son admitted.  Oher, who has neither the educational background nor the support to attend, is admitted purely because of his size and the guilt-inducing speech by the coach to the admissions committee.  By another strike of fate, he ends up in the home of the Tuohys with tough-as-nails Leigh Anne finding a soft spot for the reticent, hulking teenager.  The story is not as much about Oher and football as one might think; instead, it is more about Leigh Anne and her love for Michael, which just happens to play an important part in the life of Michael Oher, the football player. The refusal to linger on most revealing moments is both a strength and a weakness, however, since the viewer ends up with only a superficial idea of the dynamics of the situation and little solid idea of the real Oher, other than the gentle giant type.  It rankles a little that this story is more about how a white family made a African-American football player than how a football player made himself, but the story is what it is.  One told from Oher's point-of-view would have been entirely different, and perhaps even more sentimental given the circumstances of his background.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock is excellent as Leigh Anne; she plays her character as with both toughness and class. Aaron is good, though not great, as Oher; he is best when all his emotions are reflected in his eyes and the corners of his mouth.  He does play Oher a little too dumb at times; in the NCAA scenes at the end, he transforms from confused idiot to articulate young man overnight.  Tim McGraw plays a likable, albeit passive, Sean Tuohy.  Lily Collins as Collins Tuohy is the only cast member who demonstrates conflicted emotions.  Jae Head as S.J. Tuohy borders on the obnoxious, although his scene whipping Michael into football shape is fun to watch, even though it does smack of Disney-esque montages.<br /><br />Although The Blind Side offers no challenges, it is an enjoyable, polished film.  The clips seen in trailers come across as much more muted in the context of the scenes themselves.  Parts of the film are surprisingly realistic -- not in the true-life-story way (I can't comment on that, not having read Oher's book) but in the believability of how the scenes unfold.  I recommend The Blind Side for viewers who like mainstream and feel-good films as well as for those who want to be entertained for a couple of hours.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmannis.

B00004XMTJ|5.0|I bought this as a replacement for a worn out vhs copy. My daughter has enjoyed watching this musical over and over again since she was about 3. When our VCR stopped working I knew I had to search out a copy on DVD and I am glad I did. This musical is wonderful just to sit down watch and get lost in.
B000MRA5NS|4.0|Without a doubt, this would have been a five-star action movie for me if it didn't lose focus briefly at the beginning of the final act, but it remains one of the finer Bond films.  Craig's Bond is grittier than that of his predecessors, with some unresolved issues that make him dangerous, even to himself.  Perhaps because this film is set at the beginning of Bond's career, he is neither as suave nor as at ease as the other Bonds, although he is every bit as likable.<br /><br />The storyline is straightforward, at least in overview:  in tracking down a bombmaker, Bond uncovers a broader terrorist presence that leads to a French financier, Le Chiffre, who literally weeps blood and who promises off-shore safe haven for terrorist funds.  What the terrorists don't know is that Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) is using their funds for his own enrichment  When Bond thwarts Le Chiffre's plan, all bets are off except at the casino, where Le Chiffre attempts to win back the sum before the terrorists get to him.  As usual, Bond has no intention of letting Le Chiffre succeed.  And also as usual, there is a Bond girl, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green).<br /><br />All the actors, including Judi Dench as the authoritative M, fit their roles admirably.  But since most people watch the Bond movies for the blow-'em-up, adrendaline-saturated scenes, the real question is whether it is an exciting movie.  The answer is yes, except for the flabbiness mentioned in the first paragraph.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B000IFQLKU|5.0|This seller sent very quickly. It was in perfect condition. Would use this seller again
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Simply put, this is the most stunning Blu Ray I've seen. The colors, the detail are simply remarkable. YES it is a double dip - as Fox and Cameron HAVE ALWAYS ADMITTED a more elaborate edition is on the way. It is NO SECRET. So, if you don't want to buy a strict movie only edition, don't buy it. I'm not sure why people are upset as clearly there is a choice offered. The movie is only 4 months old, there's no time to assemble alternate cuts and the no doubt in-depth supplements we'll see later. So every official announcement stated plainly this was a movie only edition with a loaded version to follow. Giving you a choice. Buy, rent, or wait. So it's really not clear how people are being ripped off?<br /><br />The movie itself plays much better in 2Dd as opposed to 3D. The story, while simple and told many times before, works well. My girlfriend was even drawn into the film and liked the \\"love story\\" elements. The movie is epic, no doubt, sweeping and grandiose. Entertaining and exciting.<br /><br />The gorgeous Blu Ray presentation earns the highest rating. This will be the movie people show their friends and family to show off their HD TV's.
B000000WFZ|5.0|The film The Mission is a full blown experiance in itself.  This soundtrack can stand alone without the film.  However although I find the first 13 tracks fantastic, for me the remaining 7 are not so good.   The eariler pieces are mostly upbeat and glorious in their presentation.  The latter are not much fun and while I realise the film takes a tradgic turn, there is a small element of hope right at the end which this soundtrack has missed.  To conclude I recommend the film very highly and then the aforementioned highlights.
B002AT4K9G|3.0|Fast and Furious was a good movie the DVD work well on my DVD player and PS2. The cool part of the movie two of the hottest Hip Hop Reggaeton artists Don Omar Y Tego Calderon .
B002VPE1AW|1.0|Several reviewers are talking about the lack of special features, bonus footage, etc.  That's all fine and good, but I would gladly buy just the movie for now, then \\"double dip\\" and buy a version loaded with extras at a later date.  But this release, though \\"widescreen\\" to a degree, is not presented in the theatrical CinemaScope aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  I expect that they are using the IMAX version, which has a squarer screen than typical movie theaters.  I purposefully didn't go see the movie in an IMAX theater because I enjoy the wide-widescreen of regular CinemaScope presentations... even if the screen isn't as gargantuan as IMAX.    I'm disappointed because I love the movie, but I will wait for Fox to get their act together and release this movie the way I want to see it.  It will probably sell like hotcakes, but I secretly hope it doesn't until they release a better version.
B0006B2A42|5.0|Excellent movie, lots of action, lots of mystery, look back into the Cold War and see the tension that was the time.   Six out of five stars.
B000683VI4|5.0|The Notebook is an absolute MUST see for ANYBODY with a heart, or even just a bit of romanticism in their bones. I joined Netflix and ordered it first, and watched it 5 times in 5 days before returning it. Then decided I HAD to have a copy of my own, so I purchased one on here (Amazon). The acting is superb, the storyline is even better, and it just brings a warm, fuzzy feeling to your entire body. I even cried each time, at the end. I couldn't understand all the \\"hoopla\\" that was abound when the movie first came out, but now I know. I'm a 51 yr. old, \\"tough guy\\", ex-athlete... and I LOVED it. So forget the \\"chick-flick\\" barrier guys, you've GOT to see this movie. I'd now put this in my Top 3 of all time movies.
0307454541|4.0|I had heard a lot of acclaim for this book, but mysteries aren't really my bag. Most of the detectives seem to be the same (another ex-cop with a drinking problem? yawn). But when I heard that the \\"detective\\" team was an older journalist and a young punk hacker, I thought I'd give it a try. I, too, figured out the pretense mystery right away, but didn't see the main mystery coming. The young Lisbeth may not be a likable character to some, but I'm totally fine with that as long as I feel she is genuine, which I did. The crux of her character is that her upbringing which is only hinted at, makes her the awkward person that she is in the book. Whereas I roll my eyes when I see an older man paired with a younger women, it really made sense in this book.<br /><br />I also agree with some reviewers who say that Larsson spent lots of time on seemingly insignificant things such as what was made for dinner or the exact business dealings of one character. He could have trimmed it down a bit. A few times I wanted to skim ahead, but took a breath and continued on. This is no formulaic romance novel or standard mystery where every single word is meant to drive the plot. Once I settled in, I enjoyed it.<br /><br />On thing that I must admit is that the film came out before I had finished the book. I read before bed, so I only get 20 or so pages a night. So, I went & saw the film anyway. It didn't distract me from continuing the book as there are several aspects to it that are not covered in the well-done film.<br /><br />This book changed my impression of mystery/thrillers and I will read the remaining books.
0060934913|5.0|awesome book really get's in depth about what it is like to be a chef
B0000029LG|4.0|So basically I agree with most people, there are already so many Michael Jackson collections with more songs to offer, and I feel this was just a last minute decesion to cash in on some extra money including these new songs with a collection disc one. I feel they are missing many songs like Smooth Criminal, Leave me Alone, P.Y.T., that could have easily been included on a second disc, and they could have released a separate album for the new songs on disc two for cheaper. Aside from this, disc two offers pretty high quality song and the deeper meanings behind many of these have a lot of feeling behind them, like the Earth song is about people harming the environment and the pain nature goes through becuase of carelessness, They really don't care about us is about the governments of impoverished countries ignoring its people and letting them starve and keeping them under strict control, and History is a nice mix with historical radio/T.V. broadcastings included. This album doesn't offer anything groundbreaking like Thriller or Bad, but it does a nice job and I feel this album does better than Dangerous at returning more to Michael Jackson's original pop roots than trying to modernize. Some of these songs offer really nice beats, as well as have a lot of feeling put into them, which makes it worth checking out. If you are a big fan, you probably will already have all the albums for the first disc songs, so you might just want to rent this and download the second disc on your computer. Again, it might not be anything revolutionary but it does a fine job, and offers a lot more songs than his typical albums.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I showed this video to my students and they also really liked it. I could tell because they watched instead of talked.
0143039431|5.0|I remember reading this last year in high school, and everyone felt it was so boring that they couldn't even continue reading, but this was one of the few books I could actually stomach and continue to read on with. I have a natural interest with American history, and my main interest is in the early 20th century during the 20s-40s. This book does a wonderful job at portraying that time period, as well as realizing what life was like for your average working man during our countries worst economic decade. People were fired and lost their land, people traveled across the country to find minimum wage jobs to support their families, people dies and lost family memebers on the way, people broke the law and commited suicide to cope, and people were miserable on top of all this. The characters aren't too boring, and go through some of the depressions worst moments. This book also shows the brutality of the government and how they would force people out of nice camps and jail them just for voicing their opinions. In the end, nothing changes, and everyone is as bad off as when they started off, if not worse. They are without a home, job, or decent meals, and this is all shown very clearly throughout the novel, as well as how Americans worked together to support each other with humane acts to hopefully make it out of the depression and regain their homes and jobs.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|Just like the 2 million different versions of Star Wars and LOTR DVDs, James Cameron is going to milk fans with a release with NO extras, only to release a special edition later in the year.  Save your money and wait for the special edition to come out in November 2010.

B000BTGY1O|5.0|I came accross this movie while I was reading a book about 500 of the best films ever made in Hollywood. I was looking up Marilyn Monroe in the index, and this was one of the movies she was listed in. I read what the book said about Breakfast At Tiffanys, and it said Marilyn Monroe was the idea for the star role, but she was in the process of changing her image, and Audrey got the role. I remember reading something like that. I rented the movie, and I loved it. My first Audrey Hepburn picture ever, and she played the role beautifully. I Love this move, and the theme  song \\"Moon River\\". This is one of my #1 favorite movies. I highly recomend it!
B002XMGGK6|1.0|Its great... till the end.  That's really all there is to it.  Don't buy it.  Watch it once, that's all you'll need.
159562015X|4.0|I am big fan of Strength Finders and the insight it provides. It provides good information for personal development as well as the opportunity to appreciate, understand and accept the strengths of others.  The only reason I cannot give this product a 5 star rating is because, it forces you to buy a new book each time you want to take the assessment.  It would be great if Gallup would provide a discount on the code especially for families with multiple folks who want to take the test and for those who want to re-do the test.  Same thing for the child's tests.  Let us buy the material once and have access to more codes at a discounted price.  Strength Finders is a good tool and should be kept in perspective as we all have many strengths.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I really enjoyed Avatar in the theaters and watched it three times in three different locations, with two IMAX 3-D and one real 3-D.    I must say this 2-D Blu-ray is absolutely stunning, beautiful, and more vivid and vibrant than watching it in the theaters. It's like watching a different version of the movie.  [I'm viewing this through my Panasonic 42\\" 1080P plasma TV (it has been color calibrated) from 8' away.]  I find, I enjoy the crispness of this 2-D Blu-ray version more than the 3-D (in the theaters), because some of the background is a bit hazy in order to enhance the 3-D effect in the foreground, thus scarficing some of the clarity.  Everything is hyper clear with this version, it's really unbelievable.    Avatar on Blu-ray is absolutely worth buying and does not disappoint.
B002GY9F9K|1.0|This Series does a poor job at recreating the Story, if you want a \\"Richard\\", Kahlan, and Zed in an alternate reality. Ok. It hardly follows the Story Line. I have only seen the first episode, but it decimated the storyline. Think \\"The Count of Montecristo\\" the Movie vs. \\"The Count of Montecristo\\" the Series. The Count of Montecristo Series was so much better than the movie that it was a disappointment to watch the Movie. That's how I feel with watching the Legend of the Seeker Series after having read the books. The Count of Montecristo Series did a fairly good job at following the book's storyline. The Legend of the Seeker does a very poor job at creating a Series that follows the books. Definitely not a \\"Lord of the Rings\\" or \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (The good one with Collin Firth.).
B002MFU9BG|5.0|Wow! Just Wow! I listen to a lot of music, and buy a lot of Amazon's daily deals. Every once in a while (I can probably count the times on a single hand) a band comes along that hits my top 5. Something so stunningly good you wonder how you've never heard of them and can't imagine them not changing your playlist forever. The Heavy - The House That Dirt Built is definitely one of these moments. I don't know what it is, but this album just works for me on so many levels. There are a number of songs that rock and a few that are beautiful as well. These guys are authentic rockers who remind me how manufactured most of the stuff I listen to actually is. I'd say more but I'm off to go find more albums by The Heavy.
B00007BH5C|5.0|I really do like this lotr ttt soundtrack alot. There is 19 tracks total. And i do have to say they are all wonderful. Tracks on there like Evenstar(which is my fav one)are very relaxing. So if i were you i would get it!!
B0000257O9|4.0|I bought the CD because I wanted one song on it because it was such a favorite of my great-grand-son.  I must admit I liked that song very much also.  I really enjoyed reading the booklet in the cover.  It was very informative.
031606792X|5.0|I have all four books - one by one they seem to find their way to one of my daughter's home and I immediately re-order the missing book!  What a well written series, so sensitive and obviously romantic.  I think that everyone wishes that they could live with their mate for 100s of years and remain the \\"same\\", without old age, illness or death. I know I would. Great escape.  I wish that Stephenie Meyers would write a 5th (not the novella coming out in June), but about Renesmee and Jake.  We would have to have the entire Cullen family, especially Edward and Bella, her dad, etc.  The books would be sold faster than they could be printed! Love it and love buying from Amazon.com.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|By now, there is an expectation that there will be bonus materials of some sort on a Bluray disk, but in the case of this Avatar release there isn't a single shred of additional material to warrant a full price bluray disk.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I am one of the people that saw Avatar multiple times in theaters and loved it.  The CGI , as well as the 3D technology infused, were by far the best I have ever seen.  James Cameron and all of the people who participated in the making of this movie did a tremendous job.  Weta workshop is taking its place at the top of the mountain, as far as visual effects companies go.  Watching this movie was like being transported to a different universe.  I was completely immersed throughout the almost three hours I was in the theater.<br /><br />As for the story and acting for the film, I am probably in the minority on most of these reviews.  The story for me, while predictable and reminiscent of other movies I'd seen previously (What movie isn't nowadays?), was extremely enjoyable.  Watching this made me feel young again.  It made me forget about all the worries that an adult life brings, and just enjoy myself in the moment.  Many people argue that the acting in this movie was subpar.  These people say that the portrayals of the characters were downright cartoonish.  I would argue strongly against that.  For the type of movie that this is, the good versus evil portrayals given by the actors works in the movie's  favor.  Sam Worthington especially does well.  If you haven't seen him in Terminator: Salvation, do so.  He made the movie worth watching.<br /><br />Now, to get to the actual product at hand.  I ordered the Blu Ray / DVD combo pack from Amazon.  From the moment the menu came onto my screen, I knew this was going to be something special.  When I pressed play, there was no turning back.  Over the next three hours, my senses were completely assaulted and my mind was dumbstruck.  Simply put, James Cameron's Avatar on the Blu Ray format is the best picture and audio we have seen or heard to date.  I have a feeling it will be years before anything better is brought to the table.  Watching the visuals was more stimulating than looking at a real life forest.  Every detail could be seen from far and away.  The walls of my house shook, and I just hope the neighbors did hear.  I would tell them to buy the movie themselves and experience it.<br /><br />With this release comes certain issues.  While I don't have any of them myself, I will still talk about them as it would be uninformative of me to not.  This release of Avatar is not in 3D.  Many people complain about this, and a large percentage of those people do not even have the right equipment to properly experience 3D yet.  The technology for home theater 3D is very new and very pricey.  Next year, after all the quirks have been worked out, is when we will likely see Avatar in a home release 3D format.  Another gripe is the complete lack of special features.  This again has a good reason.  In the Special Edition coming later this year, there will be scenes incorporated into the movie not even visually completed yet.  Documentaries in high definition have to be put together.  A commentary track needs to be recorded.  No one is being forced to buy this \\"stripped\\" edition, however. I am one of the people who will knowingly double or triple dip on this.  The reason for that is because I love it so much.<br /><br />Now to the biggest complaint.  During the initial release, many people were complaining that Avatar would not play in their Blu Ray players.  The reason for that seems to be some new copy protection put on the disc.  While I was not one of the people with this problem, I can certainly sympathize with those who did.  A new firmware update is all it will take to fix the issue.  My PS3, which serves as my Blu Ray player, had a firmware update ready for me before I watched the movie.<br /><br />So if you are one of the millions who loved Avatar when you saw it in theaters, or one of the people who didn't get around to seeing it, now is your time.  Pick this movie up right away without hesitation.  Keep an open mind, and let yourself become immersed.  You do not want to miss what many people believe is one of the top movies of all time.e believe is one of the top movies of all time.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|If all that interests you is neato visual-effects technology, then \\"Avatar\\" was made for you.  If, however, you care about little things like story, character, and originality, don't waste your time.  The plot is nothing more than a ripoff of \\"Dances With Wolves\\" (relocated to another planet) and represents the latest example of the long, endless, and boring Hollywood attack on corporate America.  It's intriguing how the left-wing end of corporate America has nothing original to say, endlessly resorting to bashing a system in which it plays a major role.  Let's face it: If it weren't for corporate America, James Cameron would be jobless and homeless.  This movie is yet another hypocritical hunk of garbage.
1416585710|5.0|I found Lisey's Story to be one of Stephen King's more beautiful works, a love story rich in imagery that takes you away to another world, where adventures in the dark forest reach an unprecedented peak.<br /><br />This other world felt, to me, like a brilliant projection of the subconsious mind--an analogy to the way a creative person might experience the muse or the mysterious source of art.<br /><br />Its a book to read for pure pleasure, and to cherish the feeling of what real and tender romantic love between two people can be.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|This is still a great movie but I do wish I had read these reviews before purchasing it. Really looked forward to the extras and commentaries only to find them missing and will have to buy it again.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|I was excited about the impending release of Avatar. Saw it in Imax 3D. Yes, I realize that I can't see it at home in 3D, and realistically won't for a few years.  I'm not about to invest several thousand on new hardware, only to have to replace it again once the standard is finalized past the \\"Minimum\\" - remember the first milti-media PC's?  The standards changed every few months and were finally simi-finalized a couple of years later. The same will happen for 3D.<br /><br />Way too many companies screw-over the public by re-re-re-releasing movies.  Remember \\"Stargate\\" - ?  The original release, limited edition release, anniversary release, director's cut, limited edition director's release and so on. Literally. Same with LOTR.  What, four different versions on DVD, with and without little statues?  Now the same thing with LOTR on BluRay. Same with Resident Evil. Now Avatar.  I'll bet we'll see five versions over the next year or so. This release, the Director's Cut, the cinema 3D version, Director's cut 3D version, then we'll see a special extended (we found missing footage!!!) super duper cut. Probably followed by the \\"Official extended director's cut with a look back on the social impact of Avatar.\\"<br /><br />Just look at all the versions of Army of Darkness.  This will be even worse.  I was going to purchase this, but decided to jump off the little hamster wheel.  I'll wait several months and then pick from the myriad releases.<br /><br />I did rent it.  Guess what? It was not that great. Without 3D it's nothing special.  I lost count of how many ideas were ripped off from better movies.
0735619670|2.0|I've read this book cover to cover and found myself quite annoyed of it most of the time.  Contrary to the stated intended audience, a professional programmer with real industry experience of more than a couple of years will find most of the advice here shallow, boring and obvious.  This book could have easily been cut by 50% without any loss of real content by avoiding repetitions, useless information and self references.    This book is heavily grounded in practices of C++ and Java and contains almost nothing for programmers of other languages like Python, Perl, Ruby, Javascript, lisp, PHP etc'. It contains no word about the functional programming paradigm and acts as if OOP is the only way to go. This goes to an extreme in a hilariously absurd section about recursion which states that \\"Recursion isn't useful often\\" and that it should be considered only for \\"a small set of problems\\".   The best programming advice I have ever received and which I pass along to the author is to learn another language. Preferably one that is widely different from what you're used to.    A few other annoyances I found throughout the book:  - The template \\"A study performed at [COMPANY X] in [19XX] found that [SUPPORT CURRENT CLAIM]\\". These kind of statements are meaningless to me as a reader. I don't care who did the study and when it was. I do care about how that claim was validated and how the method is still relevant in present days. That bit of information is almost always missing.    - The chapter about code tuning contains a lot of number and comparisons of different techniques but lacks any real credibility since it fails to state the conditions in which the techniques were tested. Some of the things described are highly processor and compiler dependent. Some depend heavily of the amount of cache and memory and the data being used. The author does excuse himself by saying that before you do any tuning you must first profile and look for hot-spots but that doesn't excuse him from basic scientific method and academic decency.    - Almost every chapter starts with something like \\"If you're not interested in Y and are interested in X you can skip to section Z\\". This is what the index is for.     - All of the side bar notes titled \\"cross reference\\" and \\"further reading\\" are superfluous. It almost seems like the author did a text search to find where the current subject is also mentioned in the book and linked there. Again, this is what the index is for.    - Repetition. some of the advice and anecdotes appear again and again and again. By the end of the book it felt like I've read the sentence \\"Use boolean functions to clarify boolean tests\\" atleast a dozen times. Another extreme example was a section of about 4 pages with some 20 bullets on some subject which is followed by a page and a half \\"check list\\" section which contains a summary of those 20 bullets.     - Contrived examples. When the author wants to make the point that something is bad you can be sure that he'll come up with the most stupidly contrived example to make that point. A more interesting approach would be to look at something that an actual, non-brain-dead, programmer would actually consider writing, explore the reasons why he would write that and explain what is wrong with his reasoning.    If you're a professional not just fresh out of CS studies and you keep yourself informed on blogs like \\"Joel on software\\" and \\"Coding horror\\" (which borrows its logo from this book) you can safely skip this one.
0446563048|4.0|Great companies are made by great people. This book takes us in a wonderful journey that shows us the building of one of those companies. But the company itself is just a small part of this book because in it I found a whole new mindset that can be applied to virtually any business - I suspect with revolutionary results.<br /><br />Everyone with a small business (like myself) should read this book and be blown away by such a new perspective on management.
0060594896|5.0|I actually started out with the book in hardcover.  Then I ended up taking Jack's coaching class (basically followed the book# and took it further to the next level.  The course came with the soft cover book, which I enjoyed more that the hardcover as it was ligter and easier to read while in bed.  The book has something for everyone.  I was amazed to find out that I was really looking at things from a no win perspective.  This book has changed my life. Truly, I would say, it inspired me to take chances and go for joy instead of status quo.  I was an Occupational Therapist stuck in the same old job...working in a nursing home.  With the information #inspiration) in this book, I left that job and started a travel OT job in a hospital 60 miles away.  With this experience I was able to land a hospital job closer to home.  I can honestly say from the heart, I love my job!  Basically, I never would have even thought to do the travel job or hospital work before reading The Success Principles.  Since then, I am also releasing a children's book called \\"Aunt Tami's Strawberry Farm\\".  Another dream!  I recommend this book as a gift to all new grads all the way to 90 years olds.  Dreams are always a possibility if you believe.  This book will help you do that.  Terri Ward
0340952385|4.0|Unlike most of Stephen Kings novels where there are monsters and ghosts that scare, what makes this story terrifying is the idea of being lost and alone in the Maine woods.  Throwing in a 9 year old girl as the main character makes the story even more frightening.<br /><br />Trisha is hiking in the woods with her mom and older brother.  Neither pay any attention to her as they are too busy fighting.  Trisha stops to go to the bathroom, and before she realizes it, she is lost.  Instead of staying in one spot, she walks and heads toward the river.  Following the river until, after a few days, she is 30 miles from where she originally started.<br /><br />Near the end, Trisha is starving, growing sick with fever and at her breaking point for exhaustion.  Is it really a monster that is chasing her or just an animal in nature hungry for a meal?  My favorite quote is from the author that sums up Trisha's ordeal:  \\"Sometimes you eat the bear . . . and sometimes it eats you\\".
B002VPE1B6|1.0|Please note this review is about the product, not the movie.    There are zero special features on these two discs (blu-ray & dvd).  I was shocked to get this in the mail today only to find no special features.  Then I find out James Cameron has already confirmed a special edition due out in November with 20-40 extra minutes of additional footage and most likely special features.  Let me get this straight, we (the average consumer) made Avatar the number one grossing movie of all time and this is how you repay us?  By giving us the short end of the stick?    If you consider that this release has no special features, this makes Avatar the most over priced Blu-Ray disc I've purchased yet.  First Lord of the Rings, now Avatar.  We need to send a clear message to the distributors and movie producers that we will not put up with this kind of service.  I love this movie and have been eagerly anticipating it's release on Blu-Ray only to find it the worst released title to this format.    Shame on 20th Century Fox for this sub-par release, and shame on James Cameron for not sticking up for what is right.  He managed to make a fantastic movie be overshadowed by a home release that is unacceptable by screwing over the very people that made his movie number 1.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|After some commercial flops and disappointments, and a period of personal retrenchment for Canadian screen star Rachel McAdams, she comes back in a big box office smash--but will it help her career?  Does anyone in fact know that she's in it?  Though she's amusing and maybe sexier than she's been in previous parts, McAdams is given short shrift as Irene Adler--for Holmes, she would always be \\"The Woman,\\" and a lot of painful allusions to her sexual life proved one of the more embarrassing updates to the old Holmes canon.  She seems embarrassed herself at some of the twists her character is doomed to lurch through--though she always looks good in the elaborate period costumes of the late Victorian era.  Or is it the Edwardian Age?  The character Mark Strong is playing, based obviously on Aleister Crowley, is playing him as the \\"wickedest man in England,\\" a reputation Crowley didn't achieve until 1910 or so, and the establishment of the O.T.O.  You have to give the screenwriters some props for inventing puzzles for Holmes to solve that are actually cleverer than the ones he dealt with in the books, though Guy Ritchie's super sped-up flashbacks and retreads aren't very helpful at underscoring this.  We saw this movie on a Jet Blue flight to NY during which every ounce of free TV had been wiped out due to technical difficulties, so the pilots relented and let us watch all the pay movies for free.  Might not have seen it otherwise, and that would have been a mistake.  Wonder what seeing it in the theater was like.  I don't think it was meant for one of those five inch screens not much bigger than my IPhone.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|I just watched this one last night and it was an enjoyable ninety-plus minutes.  LAKE HOUSE reunites Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves, who were so much fun in Speed.  Bullock plays a workaholic doctor living in 2006, while Reeves is an architect trying to decide what he wants to do with his life two years earlier.  Through the intervention of a 'magic mailbox' the two begin to correspond, and eventually fall in love.    Throughout the course of the film Keanu slowly starts to interact with Sandra's earlier self, until he finally catches up with her in 2006.  Fans of time paradox films like the BACK TO THE FUTURE series will likely enjoy this love story.  Its not nearly as twisted up as the Christopher Reeve/Jane Seymour outing SOMEWHERE IN TIME, but has some similar elements.  Was it perfect ?  No...  But it might make for a good date night film combining some sci-fi elements for the guys and an enjoyable romance for the ladies.    For the record, the end left me wondering if they had tested the film one way and ended up with a different ending.  That said, Bullock and Reeves manage to pull off an intriguing and fun flick one more time.
1410423786|5.0|Alexandra Horowitz, the author of this book, has a PhD in cognitive science and studied cognition in rhinos, bonobos and dogs. As the order indicates, she came to dogs last as objects of scientific study and in this her career mirrors the efforts of cognitive scientists generally who (as she notes in her book) have only turned seriously to dogs in the last twenty-five or so years, perhaps because the nearly omnipresent dog was mistakenly thought to be a simple and uncomplicated creature. As most dog owners will tell you, nothing could be more wrongheaded than to think of dogs as simpletons of the animal kingdom.    Using the findings of many dog studies, mostly from the last thirty years, Horowitz shows that dogs are marvelously complex creatures whose senses and brains are exquisitely attuned to their environment, a large part of which is humans. Dogs know their world well, and humans intimately. Part of this comes from the intense focus that dogs bring to bear on us and part from the array of extraordinary sensory equipment that they use to focus. Dogs' sense of smell, for example, is (practically speaking) infinitely better than ours and easily able to detect chemical \\"tells\\" about our emotions, state of mind, and past and present activities.    Horowitz takes us on a grand tour of dogs' sensory apparatus and how it compares to the human equivalent. She explores what is known of their social behavior, including the many signs and signals they use in dealing with one another and with us; and she discusses their emotions and psychological processes, including cognition and the possibility of canine self-awareness.     Horowitz's overriding purpose is to let the reader share something of how a dog actually perceives, interacts with, and communicates with the world and other creatures. She repeatedly points out that we do a disservice to the complexity and uniqueness of dogs when we either anthropomorphize them (see them as limited humans) or treat them as insensatecreatures which exist merely for our convenience.    Horowitz does all this in a direct and interesting style that neither over complicates things nor talks down to the general audience for which it is intended. She gives many clear factual examples to illustrate her points (providing factoids for those inclined to amaze their friends). With her main narrative she also mixes frequent mini-essays talking about her personal relationship with her obviously much loved dog Pumpernickel (usually called \\"Pump\\"), revealing herself as a dog lover as well as a dog scientist. She also provides simplified notes for those who may wish to explore her sources.     This is an excellent, well-written and delightful book.

B002HWUU2C|5.0|As a huge fan of Once (the film and the soundtrack), I was so pleased to find out that Glen Hansard has a band that has been releasing cds for a while now.  I heard one tune on a local radio station and was hooked before I even knew the artist.  I love this cd and dvd compilation!  Such a treat!
B003C5FMEE|5.0|If you have ever heard Trombone Shorty and Orleans Ave live then you will not be disappointed with this performance. This album opens up with a strong performance of \\"Hurricane Season\\" to lay the foundation. It eases back with \\"On your way down\\".  You can hear Lenny Kravitz (background vocals and guitar) on \\"Something Beautiful\\". One of my favorite tracks is Suburbia it has a great feeling to it.     It is hard to pin Trombone Shorty to a genre, this is what makes it great.  This album is a refreshing look at Funk/Jazz/Rock.  You definitely hear the Jazz heritage coming through strong, but with some great fusion with rock and funk. By the way if he comes to your town go and see him, you will be very happy you did and you can thank me later
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is the only TV I have ever seen that is as good as Terminator: the Sarah Connor Chronicles.  it's better than TSCC because B of B has the advantage of being historical.      You won't be able to stop watching it.  The first one or two episodes might be a little draggy but, once the soldiers get out of boot camp, wow!  I watched the entire series breathlessly on TV...and I still bought the CD. What does that tell you? I also bought Sarah Connor.  These two are the only tv shows I have *ever* bought so I could enjoy rewatching them.  They are the only shows I have ever rewatched.        This will appeal especically to people who like historical shows.  And if you have children old enough to watch war movies you should make sure they see this. Then they will understand exactly what America did in 1941-45, what an achievement it was and how it came about that Western Civilization earned the freedom we have now.
0312330529|1.0|Have you watched a season of Survivor that involved Coach?  The pathological liar, both tormented and buoyed by his obsession with \\"honor\\"?  The self-named \\"Dragon Slayer\\"?  I swear he wrote this book.  From page 2 on, I was amused and amazed to have found a book written by The Dragon Slayer.  It is hard not to giggle and chuckle when he refers to himself as an \\"artist\\", an \\"intellectual\\", a \\"philosopher\\".  By his own valuation he is at once a perfect judge of character, a master in (ALL)the arts of combat, and an expert in just about any skill for which a need arises.  Then, I turned the book over and read the author's bio, and there is a picture of Coach!  Or maybe his fraternal twin.  What is it about honor-obsessed pathological liars that makes them grow a long, thin ponytail and decide to get really into karate?  Strangely, for all the people calling this \\"the best book ever\\", which \\"changed the way they look at life forever\\", the people I spoke to directly were uniformly unable to make it past 200 pages.  I only made it through by adopting a \\"one, two, skip a few, three, four, skip some more\\" strategy.  The author describes an entire scene (skip paragraphs that begin with \\"The sea was like.....,  Boats floated on its surface like..., The ash from the fire floated through the air like....\\" \\"Her eyes were like...\\").  Then he tells what happened (read or skim this part).  Then he tells us what it meant: \\"Love is a trickle of water off the nose of a beast of burden that.....\\"  \\"Jealousy is a caged animal that lives in your heart and....\\"  \\"Obedience is a ninja's sword that....\\"  SERIOUSLY.    And now for your moment of Zen:  \\"Night, that tunnel of lights joining promise to prayer...\\"    \\"I leaned toward her, looking behind her to the left and then to the right.   'What is it?' she asked.  'I am looking for your wings.  You are my guardian angel, aren't you?\\"    \\"Her eyes were large and spectacularly green.... It was the green that the sea would be, if the sea wereperfect.\\"    \\"Every movement was a satin skin cascade.\\"    \\"Our lips made thoughts, somehow, without words: the kind of thoughts that feelings have.  Our tongues writhed, and slithered in their caves of pleasure.\\"

0060825219|1.0|Title says it all I guess, I read decides to die and eleven minutes and enjoyed them very much. I picked up Zahir expecting it to be just as good.    But it is so self-involved, egotistical, and rambling. I came to strongly dislike the main character- and  since this is supposedly a highly autobiographical work- the author. The weird philosophy/ worldview about love held no attraction for me at all.     The most disturbing part about it all was that the things that I liked about the previous two books were here in The Zahir- but were amplified to the point of being cloying and obnoxious. I felt I was being bashed over the head with a hammer by the same things I had been gently nudged by in the other works.     By the end, I was utterly Coelho-d out. I wish I had read The Alchemist first, since that is the one people seem to really like, but to be honest I don't think I can pick up another one of his books for a very long time, if ever.
B000NVT0RU|4.0|I \\"discovered\\" \\"Days of Glory\\" as a nominee for the Best Foreign Language Oscar of 2006.  I understood that I was going to discover a hidden secret from the liner notes and I guess I did.  The movie focusses on the French Army's recruitment of volunteers from their African territories during WWII and the service that those recruits experienced.  The movie's point was that the African soldiers experienced a lot more that they had expected because of France's discrimination of them.  There was little or no promotional potential for them and we view numerous scenes where things are available to the French soldiers but not the African soldiers.  The reactions that we witness are a compelling part of the film.  Another compelling part of the film were the combat sequences; especially the final battle we watch.  Actually, the FINAL battle is the culmination of the discrimination we've already watched.  There is a closing account of modern-day issues concerning French war veterans who came from countries that later broke away from the French \\"Empire\\".  After what we had seen, this information was pretty unsettling.    I could only recall three other WWII films that had French African soldiers in the cast and they were all briefly depicted.  I'm giving credit to \\"Casablanca\\" but I don't have any strong images of the local soldiers.  In another Bogart movie, \\"Sahara\\" there was a soldier from (I think) Cameroon who was a part of the ragtag crew associated with Bogart's tank.  However, it was \\"Two Women\\" (with Sophia Loren) that left a lasting impression on me.  It was, to me, an odd scene in which a jeep full of Algerian soldiers came across the title characters.  Things happen in war but I was bothered somewhat that the realization that there were Algerian French soldiers in WWII was immediately followed their evil act and quick disappearance.  I couldn't help but notice in \\"Days of Glory\\" that the soldier's orientation included the admonition to \\"stay away from the women\\".Anyhow, I appreciated the more positive impression to go along with the negative one I had seen before.
B003B02OOG|2.0|I love all of John Grisham's books.  They usually are enthralling to me.  This book of short stories should have been made shorter by not publishing them.  They could have been written by a third grader.  He hit on nothing.  He said nothing.  He bored me to tears.  I kept thinking the next story would be better.  Nope.  I would not recommend buying this book.
B002ZG4QB6|5.0|Cliff Richard and The Shadows first came together in 1958,spending the next 10 years racking up aton of hits.<br />Upon the 50th anniversary of their formation, they re-recorded 20 or so songs as well as 3 new cuts.<br />The album was performed in it's entirety, along with several Shadows hits and Cliff solo hits, for a 42-song blockbuster show of which their London performance was filmed.<br /><br />Cliff's voice is as strong as it ever was, and from rockers like \\"Move It\\", \\"Nine Times Out Of Ten\\" \\"Please Don't Tease\\" & \\"Gee Whiz, It's You\\", to ballads like \\"The Next Time\\" and \\"Visions\\" and pop fare like \\"Livin' Doll\\", \\"Travellin' Light\\" & \\"I Love You\\", Cliff can still nail them down.<br /><br />The Shadows are so musically tight, the words are unspoken, but understood. Bruce Welch is as solid a rhythm guitarist as you'll find, as well as a supreme vocal harmonist; drummer Brian Bennett is one of the all-time greats and can play in any style;<br />Brian's son Warren and Keith Hayman add wonderful keyboard textures; bassist Mark Griffiths has tenured longer than any Shadows bassist, and is the best since John Rostill.<br /><br />The Shadows' true musical voice is of course lead guitarist Hank Marvin who not only graces the Shadows songs, but adds spice to Cliff's songs as well.<br />His trusty Stratocaster is the musical centerpiece of the show, and he even pulled the Burns electric 12-string out for \\"Don't Talk To Him\\" & \\"On The Beach\\".<br /><br />The Shadows' songs include: \\"Apache\\" \\"Shadoogie\\" \\"Wonderful Land\\" \\"Atlantis\\" and more.<br /><br />Great playing and singing, great audio and video.<br /><br />If this is indeed Cliff & The Shadows' final reunion, they're going out in style. 5 stars.

B00004XONN|5.0|You've got to thank Radiohead for changing it's style; they started a new chapter in their career.  How can you blame them, it's natural of bands to run out of idea's, especially when you produce albums that sound similar (I'm not saying that is bad, in many ways it's good).  The album scared me a lot.  It's not the theme of the album that scared me.  It was the brilliance of the band, the album is filled with classic tunes like, \\"Optimistic,\\" \\"Kid A,\\" \\"Everthing in the Right Place,\\" and the, \\"National Anthem.\\"  But, I'm not the type of guy that picks and chooses which songs I like and don't like, and skip around.  Album's are meant to be listened to as a whole.  Therefore, unlike most people, I listened to the album a series of times with no skipping.  You can judge an album by listening to it once, album's like this are too rich.  Every time I listen to the album, there is something new.  That says one thing; this album is a classic.    Anyway, if you haven't purchased the album, get it.  It's too good to sell only a million in the U.S, it should have sold a zillion (more then Thriller).
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I watched The Jackson 5 when I was around 8 or 9 on TV. I recently became interested in his life.(After his death) I felt a lot like he did. Without all the details of my life, I really,really wanted to see this DVD,This Is It. I received the 2 disc version for my birthday. I am now 42 and I was totally taken aback with how honest,loving and just plain brilliant Michael was. I also purchased MOONWALK,with the new foreword and afterword. Loved that too.        I ordered a few more things about him and was actually sad that I never got a chance to see him on one of his tours. Truthfully, I am not the type to ever think about any sort of a star in any capacity other than to comment on their work. So, I was stunned that I didn't watch anything about him.          I really, really hope that everyone that liked or loved Michael Jackson buys This Is It and just watch all of the work that went into his shows. It trully is breathtaking!! Lynn
B0031S4K5E|5.0|I bought this for my daughter and she loves it!  The movie is fabulous!  The price was good!  And the little stuffed Ponyo was much bigger than I thought that it would be.
B003GJSUIQ|5.0|six new tracks are added to the deluxe edition and are really great and a joy to listen to, as when i listen to them i can picture the movie in my mind. the digital booklet is not worth it if you bought the regular cd as it is the same thing about james horner talking about how cool it was to work with jim. just wish it wasnt in album only because i already have the cd and would have just boughten the new tracks and it would have possibly saved me money but i decided i wanted to hear the new music so much i decided to just buy the album again. great music great buy.<br /><br />This may be a cliche but in my opinion James Horner is the best composer that there is today. although avatar is truly a magnificent piece by  him,also his other movie soundtracks which include: Apocalypto, the boy in the stripped pajamas, Radio, Troy, perfect storm, windtalkers, apollo 13, titanic and braveheart just to name a few of his truly great works as a composer.
1400052173|4.0|This book took me on a journey that I have found to be soul searching.  I thank the author for doing her research on the history of the HeLa cells and the personal insights of Henrietta Lacks and her family. I believe as Henrietta's daughter believed, that her mother needed and wanted her story told.
0810982862|5.0|it really is epic and this book excatly describes how everything was created and produced. great pictures, great explanations, this book really describes the art of an amazing film, goes from conception stages from the thinking of the filom a nd also shows all the different kinds of art that avatar has. great buy from the casual fan of avatar to the ultimate fan of avatar. this book has it all, everything about the arts.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|They did a wonderful job on the subtitles. I like watching movies with the subtitles on. Yes I can hear fine. Unfortunately the only downside to the movie is the blue chicks annoying throaty voice when she gets emotional.   When I popped the disc in and it actually worked on my Sony Blu-ray (which hasn't had a firmware update in over a year) I was overjoyed. I did get one glitch in chapter 16 but it was OK when I re-powered. I will update the firmware. The fluorescent colors are the best I've ever seen on a movie.   Some similarities to Dances with Wolves:  1.War scarred soldier goes to far away territory.  2.Meets girl with bad hairdo.  3.Writes diary.  4.The rest would be spoilers. So buy it and watch it.  What a great job they did to convince you that you are watching actual people, or creatures. It's not till after that you might think,,,hey did I just watch a cartoon? Naw, they were real!  So people are complaining about the lack of extra features. Well Cameron has been a very busy man lately. It's gonna take a little more time to get some good features and commentaries together. I was happy to pay the $19.99 as is.  More...  Just updated my firmware to 5.1 Sony BDP-S500  After downloading file, double click the file to extract it then save to desktop.  Next double click the icon and copy as an image to a CD-r disc. Pop it in your player \\"DISC DWLD\\" will show on your display. about 15 minutes later \\"DL OK\\" will display. If the disc doesn't play then you may have made a DATA disc instead of an IMAGE disk. Best to follow the instructions at esupport.sony.com.
B002VECM6S|5.0|WOW... Not only did I Enjoy this movie,  but a discount for early purchase.
0896898288|5.0|The 42 thoughtful letters written by farmers' wives in 26 states, from New Hampshire to California, are interesting and fun to read. These letters were all written in 1922 but the personal, familial and cultural issues are barely different from today's. This is a great bedside or coffee table book because it is just as enjoyable as a sampler, to read one or two letters at a time, as it would be to spend an evening reading them all. Laurie Hird's quilt is beautiful and inspiring and it was a brilliant idea to combine these letters and quilt blocks into one wonderful book.
B0030IIZ56|5.0|Ok, everyone knows the film itself is amazing. I mean, c'mon, it's PIXAR! They haven't done a single thing wrong since 1995, for chrissakes! I rarely take the time to write a review of a movie that has been upgraded to the Blu-ray format. But Toy Story 2 blew my mind. The first opening sequence, with the video game simulation of Buzz and Emperor Zurg, literally explodes out of the gate with window-pane shattering bass and crystal-clear clarity. I actually jumped at one point the sound is so well-rounded and defined. The entire soundtrack will most definitely give even the latest, greatest home theaters a true and genuine workout. Once your ears adjust to the insane awesomeness of the audio, your eyes will pop with the extreme detail, depth, and vividness of the picture. Watching with my friend, we began to laugh at each other once we realized just how often we would sit up and exclaim, \\"I never saw that before!\\" For instance, who knew Stinky Pete had pickaxes on his overall buttons? I sure didn't! Pick this up now, immediately, this very second! If you're one of the few who have not yet converted to Blu-ray, this is your reason too! A++ for a stellar product Pixar!
B0020MKTOS|3.0|All I Can Say Is, So I Don't Give Away What The Movie is About Is That I Did Not Like The Ending.
B00004STPT|5.0|I like the album quite well; just be aware that some of the tracks are corrupted (truncated or otherwise have \\"garbage\\" in the digital version).  I've contacted Amazon about this and have gotten no response whatsoever.  I tried downloading a single track a second time to a separate location on my computer to see if the problem was on my end, and the resulting track was identical, so the damage has to be on their end.  They need to get it fixed.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|I felt this gimmick of a movie was a joke.  Let's get the mean developers invading the \\"Alien\\" planet for the \\"gasoline\\".  Sure, the effects were well done.  But, the story was nothing new.
B00280LYIC|4.0|the lightning thief is not my favorite. it is too predictable and by the end of this book nothing truly horrible happens to percy.
B0035WTE2U|5.0|**UPDATE**  When I wrote this review, the movie had not opened yet.  I assumed like everyone else, that this was the soundtrack for the movie.  As it turned out, there was probably only TWO ACDC songs from this compilation in the whole movie.  Therefore, this CD is NOT the soundtrack for movie.  It is selected ACDC music inspired for the movie Iron Man 2.  I mean I thought it would have been perfect to have \\"War Machine\\" playing when we actually saw War Machine in the movie.  Favreau blew it.  I mean IM2 was still a good movie but I PERSONALLY feel it would have KICKED-A$$ had the movie \\"backgrounded\\" more of the Young brothers' vocals/licks.  WHO MADE WHO is still the best ACDC Soundtrack (the movie blows, though) ***<br /><br />First of all, this is not a greatest hits collection that other reviewers are saying.  It's the (selected) music (inspired) for Iron Man 2.  So keep that in mind.<br /><br />Second, AC/DC rocks no matter what.  No need to review their music.<br /><br />Third, this package is a steal!  Get it cheap while you can.  You get the CD, DVD, hardback cover with band, movie liner notes.  The version I have has movie cash.<br /><br />I look forward to watching the movie with this soundtrack in mind.  I'm already psyched just based on the music alone.  Jon Favreau, you are the comic movie god.<br /><br />As for the compilation, it is a good mix of Bon and Brian with, of course, the backbone of Angus, Malcolm, Cliff.  I bought the Who Made Who soundtrack.  It wasn't greatest hits collection either but it put AC/DC on the silverscreen map.  Their music along with what-looks-to-be-another-great Iron Man will make them immortal.  So, yeah, I like how this collection spans from the 70's to the 2000's like a greatest hits collection, but we all know, EVERY AC/DC album rocks.<br /><br />Add this one to your collection.
B002VECM72|5.0|That movie was wonderful, well written, divinely performed and sent such a great message.    Sandra Bullock deserved the Oscar she received.  This movie proved that there are people in this country willing to help and color doesn't matter.  Of course being a bit wealthy, makes it easier to help others, but they did and that is what counts.  Prejudice wasn't allowed in their home, too bad the remainder of the country doesn't think that way.
030726999X|5.0|Gah!  I feel bereft.  I know all good things must end, but Wow!  I will miss having more of these books to look forward too.<br /><br />Every one I read, I thought it's the best of the trilogy.  And maybe this one was.  For me, it seemed a bit less flawed than \\"Fire\\", but \\"Fire\\" had so much more Salander, so I'll stick with \\"Fire\\" as my favorite, but this one was great, too.<br /><br />The characters are fascinating, the story-telling is top notch, the detail is interesting and relevant.  As this book unfolded, I felt even more impressed with the story telling, because it was very clear that the whole trilogy had been conceived from the start.  It was so well-plotted.<br /><br />Another thing I really liked about this series was to gain insight into another culture.  In this book there was a court proceeding, and it's impossible as a US citizen not to have a preconceived idea of a court proceeding.  This was very different, and I kept saying to myself \\"well, that's ridiculous, that wouldn't happen that way in court\\", and then I'd remind myself ... Maybe it does happen that way in Sweden.  It's just fascinating.  I'd love to observe a Swedish trial just to observe the differences.<br /><br />I didn't feel it mattered all that much if you read \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" before \\"Fire\\", but having read this book I'd say you definitely want to read the first two first.<br /><br />Even if this isn't your normal genre, I highly recommend the series.<br /><br />Stieg - I'm so sorry you didn't get to enjoy your success.  But Bravo!
B003EVWDR0|1.0|I was just about to buy this to put into \\"My Library\\" to watch on my roku, but it will not be available after 10/25 unless I download on my computer.  That pretty much defeats the purpose of video on demand for me.  Granted, they say - at some \\"unknown time\\" we will get access again - when? After your Nov release?  When? Give me details so I can make an informed purchase.    People talk about how CEO's of corporations make too much money. Spare me... Remember Star Wars - trilogy on VHS and then Lucas added his CGI and came out with another version.  Then of course on DVD and then all six, etc. etc.  It is endless the versions they come out with, but hey, why not - people keep buying it.      So, no for me on Avatar.  The visuals were good.  The storyline was cliche'.  I just wanted to see it on my home theater.  I'll buy something else.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|Crappy movie, stupid tree hugging, hippie underlying message from another smug Hollywood jackass. The last good movie Cameron made as T2. Why don't he retire already? His stories are lame and are always ripped off of something else. Of course, that would be decribing Hollywood in general. Cameron sucks and his overhyped movie sucks too. Don't waste the time watching this, your time is too valuable.....even if you like to stare at inanimate objects for hours on end.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|This movies is excellent. It tells a true story about devotion and love and does a good job of doing so. The animals are incredible, and the story is amazing. I recommend this to anyone who loves animals and understands just how smart and dedicated they can be.   I have a an Akita Inu, and the difference from every other dog breed I have owned is beyond explanation. This is the only dog I have had that dug her way back into my yard after inadvertantly getting locked out by an unsuspecting family member, so when you see this movie, you will see a story of an an animal that is hard to describe as just a dog. Her mannerisms are far separated from any other breed of dog I have have the good fortune to witness.   A story of an animal that devotes itself in a way that is uncommon, and not seen in the average dog. When you see this movie, it is a picture of a breed that cannot be described in terms of any other. The inteligence, mindset, and characteristics of the Japanese bred (not the American) Akita is far from anything most people experience in a dog breed. The movie captures only a small piece of the kind of animal that was carefully bred over many centuries, and because of a few owners who have no idea what they had is misunderstood in society.   Yes, the movie will make you cry, perhaps some will think it sad and feel badly for the dog, but in understanding this breed and this spectactular animal you will see that Hatchi was doing exactly what made him desire to exist. We as people can take a lesson from the story if we could only devote ourselves to our mates the same way.   My \\"Hatchi\\" Akita literally picked me when I went to get her as a puppy, I did not choose her. Too many people think they can choose a Japanese Akita, only to find they are not matched as they could be. As in the story, the the dog chooses their companion. This fact will be missed by many who watch this, but hopefully many more will see what transpires here. The story is told in such a way as to capture some of the great characteristics of a breed that was almost driven to extinction, and those of us who have experienced one first hand are grateful they are still with us and can relate to this wonderful story.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I did not see the movie in the theaters.For two reason, one I seldom make it through a move with needing a rest room break Old Age. I enjoy the movies more at home. I watch the movie in Blue Ray then none HD. There is a world of difference in the picture quality.The none HD  the colors are flat, simply put it is not the same movie. This movie realy show what HD can and should do. So many movies say they are HD but really are not. My over all view of the move is very good. There are a few times when what they did breaks the laws of physic but this a movie and they do it all the time. It is a movie that I amm happy that I have added to my collectin.
B0015HOFZI|3.0|Eventually got this working OK, but only because I later bought a preamp to amplify the signal from the turntable to the PC.  Without this preamp, the sound that the PC received from the turntable was like a waterfall of noise with a little bit of the music coming through, and that is unacceptable. USB plug-in alternative was just the same-terrible waterfall sound.    So, be sure to (a) buy a preamp (another $60 or so), (b) then set output switch on back of turntable to Phono instead of Line, (c) set Windows 7 input to Recording-Line In, and plug the line-in cord in appropriately, and (d) then record.       I do need to explain what I mean by a \\"waterfall\\" sound.  It's my own word for lots of distortion, lots of over-the-top noise, a little bit of your music coming through to tantalize you that \\"oh there's SOMETHING\\" working, and a lot of quavering/distortion in what you do hear.  You are never going to be satisfied with that noise.    When you get this to work with a preamp, etc., it works fine to download all your LPs.  You'll get the scratches and so on that are on the LPs, but of course there is no way ever around that.      So, I did get this to work very well on inputting vinyl LPs, but you gotta mess around with the inputs/connections and separately buy a preamp.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I bought the first two seasons of \\"Big Bang Theory\\" because my kids asked me too.  I must say its not only them that have seen it.... we've all enjoyed it!!
B002M9WW30|4.0|THIS IS A MUST FOR ROCKY & STALLION FANS. QUALITY IS VERY OK, FEATURE IS OK, THE REALLY WEAKNEST IS NO COMMENTARY BY STALLION FOR ROCKY 1, SO DO NOT GIVE AWAY YOUR OLD 2 DISC DVD COLLECTION. STALLION IS BEST IN COMMENTARY, JUST LISTEN TO ROCKY & ROCKY BALBO HOW HE TALK US THROUGH THE MOVIE END. TEARS MAKER.
B0033G9OFA|2.0|The mastering is just plain bad and that is surprising given that Rhino and the remaining Doors  put their stamp on this product BUT have only recently Remastered the entire catalogue with Superb Sound (Purists, sorry but the 40th Anniversary remixes WOULD make Jimbo proud...they are interesting to listen to, tastefully done, and have much greater depth and separation of sound...) Heck, there were Doors cds out 10 years ago that sounded better than this. Also enjoy Johnny Depp as an actor, but really if the point is to have the movie be \\"The Doors Tell Their Story in Their Words\\" then mix in Jim in full stereo reciting his poetry. I DO have high hopes for the movie!
B002HR1W1K|4.0|VERY GOOD PICTURE & SOUND QUALITY, GOOD MOVIE. IF U LIKE HOT FUZZ, DO NOT MISS SHAUN OF THE DEAD
0446563048|4.0|There is no doubt in my mind that this man is a genius, and the best part is that he has focused his genius on the power of HAPPY and GOOD - what a RARE commodity in the business world!    This is a powerful story of following your heart and manifesting it in the real world.    I am not a business person, but this inspires me to consider starting my own business.    This was a very inspiring and \\"happy ending\\" book based in the real world!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|^^^Ok, gave it a 5! Before I get flamers coming after me, I will explain my 5.    My 5 rating was more heavily based on the movie itself and not really the other stuff (u know, the whole special features thing).    Movie:     I really liked/loved this movie. Interestingly enough, I have never seen Pocahauntus nor Dances With Wolves, and I hear people complaing how Avatar is just an exploitation of these movies. The basic features of the story may be copied, but the whole experience is magnificently new. Believe me when I say this, many of the movies that we love are \\"copies\\", or are similar to previous works done. Just think of the story of Romeo & Juliet by Shakespeare, it is a very good story, and undoubteldy a copied one which we have seen used numerous times in moves as the main theme. Before you go on about how the story is unoriginal though, realzie that the elements and environment used to tell the story is very different and provides such an enriching experience. Before you judge it too harshly just ask yourself what you want out of a movie, chances are it is unreasonable. A \\"good\\" movie is one that can embue you with a wide range of emotions and make the movie real in your mind. I have never seen a movie that made me hate humanity so much (but note that not all humanity is destructive and ruthless, just some here and there). As far as movies go, Avatar (in my opinion) is one of the best of all time. Thus, 5 stars.    Special Features:  This is a big one; probably the main reason why Avatar has 3 1/2 stars. I agree with the negative remarks. It is unfair and downright greedy for Fox to try and milk us like this. Releasing the normal version now only to relase the bigger and better version later is a very good tactic that they use to get almost twice as much money out of Avatar. You got to admit those rich (*edit*) are smart; and their smarts/greed are just going to make them even richer/greedier!  However, just think about it like this, if YOU do not want togive the fat cats twice the money for this movie, then dont. If you feel that buying this movie twice is not going to put you out on the street, then who cares! Buy it again, go for it!! Them being the rich milkers-of-the-people and us being the economically average(/\\"the milked\\") is just the way it is. The quality of the movie should not be based on whos getting paid bank and whos buying what twice or three times. It is up to you (the customer) to decide if you want to buy this product or not. If you can afford to buy this movie several times, then you shouldnt be complaining. If you can't afford to buy this movie multiple times, then it is up to you about which version you want to buy (if you want to buy it at all) and how long you are willing to wait for it. Its that simple. Theres no need to make things harder than they actually are.    I just wanted to add my opinion, because I feel that the rating system used on Amazon is a very useful tool when shopping online. And rating should really just be about the quality of the product itself and not about how companies are screwing us over. That kind of stuff belongs somewhere else on a blog or something. But I mean no offense to anybody, and of course this is just my opinion. Thank you for reading.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I had read some negative reviews on Amazon about this Blur-ray disc for not being in 3D and not having extras, but since I had enjoyed the Avatar in theaters so much, I went ahead and purchased the Blue-ray disc this afternoon. After watching the movie on my Panasonic High Definition Plasma TV, I was totally blown by quality of the picture and the fantastic DTS True-HD surround sound on this disc. Even though Avatar on Blue-ray is not in 3D,it is the next best thing to watching it in theaters. If you have a good HD video and audio equipment, this Blue-ray will show case your system the best. By the way, my Sony model BDP S-560 player had no problem playing back this disc.   I have to say that Avatar by far is the best Blue-ray disc that I have watched and I Highly recommend it.
B000JIHP88|5.0|I love the music and the sound level! the night light is great too. My daugther loved going to sleep with this. and to save on batteries you can just do the music and light without the mobile going at night.or just the music. It was easy to put together too.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|The relationships are unusual and the plot is very good. Been watching season 2 and it hasn't disappointed.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|I just bought this movie today, popped it in the Blu-ray player for the family and found out I need a @#$%ing firmware update from Sony to play it. I went to their website to download the update only to find there is only a windows version. So now I have to wait a week for Sony to send me a CD. Thanks James a heads up on your new security software would have been nice.     As most of you know this movie has no extras, but it does come with a fantastic DVD version. Why anyone would want an extra copy of this movie on DVD when they bought the Blu-ray version is beyond me. Maybe James could have included the security update in lieu of his less superior version of the movie.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Some of the segments make you disgusted, but it is very enlightening. Worth the watch!

B002LE8EFQ|3.0|It was okay.  Bought it because she has a great voice but really not overjoyed with the CD.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|I HATE this album - because I can't stop listening to it. (This is a subsequent review after I've had the record for a week.  My original review is in the paragraphs below) I've listened to it from beginning to end at least twice a day for the past week.  That's over three hours a day!  Every time I listen to it I find more nuances.  It's just mesmorizing how much thinking and hard work went into making it.  The worst part is that it makes everything else I listen to sound insubstantial, frivolous, and vapid.  I keep thinking 'Natalie could have made this better'.  C'mon Neil (Young), you can do better.  Cowboy Junkies, try harder!  John, Paul, George and Ringo, what were we paying you for?  I have to find a twelve step program for this. The album is that good.    Wow - I love this album.  I could never have imagined a record like this would be made in this day and age.  I'm not going to describe the music, you can read about that in the description and the many reviews.  All I can say is that when I listen to the album it reminds me of the first time I entered into one of those really old well built houses with the big timbers and the fine details.  Everything just oozes with quality and fine craftmanship.  You know nothing like this would be made today.  You're not even sure how it was made at the time it was built. Maybe it's a poor analogy, but great music is like great architecture.  You don't see great architecture or hear great music.  You feel it.     - On a side note, I'm disapointed with Amazon.  I pre-ordered this album before its release and ended up paying $19.00 for the album (well worth it), but then within a few days after it was released the price dropped to $14.99 plus you get a free song download. I thought by pre-ordering I would receive the album on the release date, but instead it was delivered three days later.  So I ended up paying more and getting the album later than had I bought the album at Target.  Is this any way to treat your pre-ordercustomers?  Shouldn't there be some benefit to pre-ordering?
B002ONC9NC|2.0|Okay, let me see if I have this straight....    spoilers below.....                      Teenage girl hooks up with older guy very quickly.  Her parents are okay with it.  Her teacher and headmistress object.  She thinks she has life all figured out.  She travels with this guy and his rude, theft-prone friends and believes she is becoming worldly.  She thinks she is above it all and drops out of school.  Then she finds out the guy is married and suddenly realizes what a stupid mistake she made.   She manages to get into Oxford anyway.    I could not get into this.  I didn't care about these people and did not find the story very compelling or believable.  And if you're going to have Emma Thompson show up in a movie, why not give her more than five minutes of screen time?  Stunt casting does not help a weak script.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|The documentary is distracted by the horrible narration of Oprah, to the point that I could only focus on her instead of the imagery on the screen. Her script and tone are almost insulting to the listener.  The series is worth purchasing but buy the BBC version instead.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|My grand nieces were heartbroken when they had to give up Pocahontas to a rental store. So, I went to Amazon and ordered one for them along with II. They are so thilled. They watch them over and over. I had this copy in my hands within days after I ordered it. Thank you.
0385523386|5.0|I read about this book on a bloggers web site and had to have it. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. The author did a great job humanizing all the women she was locked up with. Most importantly, she gave female prisoners a voice, one which is often ignored. You will not be disappointed with this book!
B00004R99U|5.0|My little grand nieces cried when they had to give up the rented copy of Pocohantas. So I ordered it and Pocahontas II. I received this one first within days of ordering. They watch it over and over.I am very happy that they are happy. I am thrilled at how fast it was shipped so soon.

B001VNB54A|5.0|I have seen the first 6 episodes of the Pacific and it is always quite tempting to compare it to Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan. Judge it on its own merit. Like most of us, we have been attracted to the European Theater because Hitler and the Nazi's make such classic Hollywood bad guys. The Pacific Theater seems to of faded away beyond Pearl Harbor and Midway. \\"The Pacific\\" is s startling relevation of war at its worst. It not only depicts the savage cruelity war inflicts on the physical being but the mental damage that also incures. No one really ponders the fact that these men had to live with their memories the rest of their lives. These citizen soldiers were ordered to witness and commit terrible acts upon their fellow human beings. When the war was over, \\"Just go home and pick up your former life and act like nothing happened\\" seemed to be what society expected of them AND they did it. Never complaining. The Pacific really shows the aweful mental side of World War II. It challenges the sanitized perception of the so called \\"good war\\".  Civil War General William T Sherman said that \\"War is Hell\\". He never could of imagined what our Marines in WWII had to endure.     Thanks to these men, I have the luxury to sit in my comfortable recliner (now made in Mexico), watching my Japanese manufactered Samsung flat screen TV <---(How sad). WWI soldiers in both theaters of war (and the female homefront heros), gave us the freedoms we enjoy to this day. We who NEVER had to experience the hell and sacrifice that they experienced, owe them more then what we have allowed our society (and world) to have degenerated in to. They fought and died for our nation because they felt America was a nation worth dying for.  We should do no less. To me The Pacific has given me a great Nationalistic feeling of pride in not only honoring our European Band of Brothers but now honoring those Pacific Band of Brothers as well. Thank you WWII veterans for allowing me to grow up and livein a free society. I will not forget you.    PS. Thank you ALSO: Korean and Vietnam vets. Your sacrificies were NOT in vein! You too are honored patriots and heros.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|I was at Walmart earlier today and the Blu-Ray alone was $25. The standard DVD was $20. If all you want is a great movie on both formats, this is a bargain.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|I purchased the Ear Force X41 after doing a lot of research.  My research paid off.  I like the sound that comes out of these headphones, like other reviewers have mentioned there is a little hiss that can be heard at higher volume levels, but I really can't hear it at the volume level I use.  The sound quality is superb, I really like the surround sound when playing an FPS or watching a movie.  They seem a little tight on my head but I should get used to that after some regular use.  I have not experienced any of the popping noises that some complain about.  Being a wireless engineer, my suggestion for those that have the popping issues is; Move your x41 base station and headphones as far away from any 2.4GHz wireless devices as possible, the greater the distance the better.  Also, if your access point supports lowering the transmit power, try doing that if you don't need the maximum possible range.  Overall I'm happy with my purchase and recommend it to others looking for a good gaming headset.
0030565812|5.0|One of the most influential and interesting biography i've ever read so far. Can you imagine yourself being thrown in jail for 27.5 years/10,000 Days/a quarter-century ? I don't know how Mandela did it but he finished his journey with dignity. \\"There is no easy way to freedom w/o going to the valley of death\\" He went down to the valley but didn't stay there. He fought the evil of racism and brought the nation together. Freedom was inevitable because this man walked a righteous walk! Today people of South Africa live in harmony because of the self sacrifice of this honorable man! He's one of the absolute greatest world leaders who ever lived! I RAISE MY HAT AND SALUTE YOU Mr. Nelson Mandela.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|If you have an older Pioneer Blu-ray Model BDP-05FD/BDP-51FD you'll need what some blogs around the net are calling the \\"Avatar\\" firmware update. I'm not sure about other types of players. Just go to the Pioneer USA site and get it, it's the version 1.65, be prepared for some long download times, but it works. Make sure you follow Pioneer's update directions to the letter so you don't have any problems with your player.<br /><br />If you do regular firmware updates for your older Pioneer Blu-ray you may already have it, however if you are like most folks you don't really think about doing firmware updates unless a disc will not play or you get the screen of frustration when you put a disc in.<br /><br />The disc. The Blu-ray looks amazing, and while you won't get that blow your mind immersion like the theater 3D or IMAX 3D it works well on the home screen and is a good demo disc for your home theater.
B000UX6OHK|5.0|I had seen this watch in a Swatch store for $118 and bought it for my sister. I really liked it and dint actually feel like giving it to my sister...anyways i did give it to her coz I knew she will love it. After a few days I looked for it in Amazon and found it for a lesser rate with free shipping. Bought it and now I am glad i did. It's a sleek and elegant watch. Perfect gift. Service was promt. No issues. Some might have to adjust the strap in watch store..but its worth it. Go ahead and buy it if you like it.
B001OQCV6A|1.0|Where to start?!  If you compare this to some of the great hits, it comes out way on the bottom.  The plot is weak, the script is corny.  The over the top violence (which seems to be a \\"necessary\\" filler in every movie nowadays) is stupid. The phony English accents are hard to understand - we missed a lot of the dialog.  There are too many dark scenes.  Once you figure out where the plot is going (not so easy since it is distracting) you figure out the end and wonder if you want to struggle through.   Downey is a good actor I guess, but he plays a totally unlikeable and not very interesting loser with slapstick thrown in just for good measure.  The movie is nothing like anything Arthur Conan Doyal wrote and he would roll over in his grave to know how much license was taken to destroy his books and especially Holmes character.  Of the 4 of us, one left in the first 1/2 hour, one went to bed halfway through and two us us slept through the last 10 minutes.  So typical of most movies, lotta \\"wizzbang violence, darkness, noises but little substance or depth.  Basically, it is a waste of time.  Amazon should screen reviews - the ones that drooled all over themselves at how great it was - obviously written by someone involved in the film production - maybe the script writer, producer, etc.
B0010YSD7M|2.0|I'm a fan of Stargate, and a HUGE fan of seasons 9 and 10.  Obviously I had high expectations for this, but unfortunately they weren't met at ALL.  The writing was just terrible.  I mean it would be okay for a decent action movie, but by Stargate standards it was garbage.      Everything was stilted, things (like the Ori, the Priors, the Orisi) that were scary as hell in the series were kind of boring and/or goofy seeming in this.  The wonderful chemistry between the cast felt completely absent.  Vala and Sam barely have a part-Sam's reduced to a handful of tech lines, Vala has to spew a few paragraphs of boring exposition (she's an amazing actor...but how do you strike the write tone for that character while reading...paragraphs of boring exposition?)  The only one who really gets a decent amount of screen time is Cam.    We have a generic, unbelievable bureaucrat, like they're saying \\"hey, remember those awful bureaucrats we've seen on Stargate?  He's like them!\\"  We have a shift of loyalties that comes out of the blue, and doesn't seem to have any connection at all to how the character was ALWAYS portrayed.      Heck, even the 'dialing the gate' scene was done 1000x better at the end of \\"Unending\\".    I'm really not sure how to rate this.  I didn't hate it, but it's a huge disappointment, and doesn't do the series justice at all.  To the people who seem to have only watched this movie and are judging the series by that-start at the beginning, or at the beginning of season 9.  I don't regret seeing it, and any fan of the series like me is going to have to...but wow...I'd love to know what went wrong.
0375826742|4.0|Yes, the book is very long and there are many unneccesary parts, but you have to appreciate his creativity. It is very descriptive and well written. Plus, he obviously has done a heck of a lot of research, so he should get credit there too!   And, I'm so interested in how Eragon is going to pull off winning it all. It's intense!  AND, I nearly cried when I found out who his father was.    This book is very, very good...BUT...THE SUSPENSE IS KILLING ME!!!  WHERE IS THE FOURTH BOOK?  Honestly, this is taking forever!  You can only appreciate the creativity and intense plot for so long before you forget the entire series even existed- unless the fourth book finally gets out and you have an impressive, exciting ending to remember.   Christopher Paolini, PLEASE HURRY UP!!!
B000AMJC2K|2.0|I bought this arm extension to be able to adjust the monitor in a proper position and to move it out of my way if I don't need it. The device is made out of solid metal and looks nice. However if you are planing to have an arm extension that allows you to move the monitor around, this is not for you. I think it is intend to be in a fixed position and then it is fine.    For me it is not working. After a half week of using this extension moving the monitor in and out my way several times the day the screws are getting more and more loose and it's just a matter of time till this thing falls apart.    Also one of the plastic cable fixer broke the very first day. Regarding the extension height, I had set it to max to adjust it properly to my height. I mounted this device on my desk.
0446567337|4.0|I have always been skeptical about romance novels and must confess I was never a fan of The Notebook or A Walk to Remember.  However, throughout the years I have become noticeably more interested in Nicholas Sparks novels. Dear John is an addiction and I couldn't put it down. I admire Sparks' ability to create real characters and prove to his readers that happy endings do not always occur the way we would like. Its not as good as The Last Song, but it is a novel you dont want to miss.

1439148953|4.0|Not much really happens in this book that isn't mundane and ordinary, yet I couldn't put it down.  It is simply an immigrant's story, yet you can see the possibilities.  I can imagine today that Eilis's children are grown up and prosperous on Long Island, with children of their own.<br /><br />The writing reminds me of Alice McDermott's - this book evoked one of my favorites, At Weddings and Wakes - what I consider to be McDermott's finest novel.  Just a story of an every day person living an ordinary life, yet somehow so compelling.  I highly recommend this book.
B00328G4V6|4.0|The bad news first: for the most part, Hendrix fans aren't going to find much here that they haven't already heard.  The title track is the only real song with lyrics and such that you might be hearing here for the first time if you're a fairly serious Hendrix fan, and though its a cool song, it sounds very unfinished to me.  I think Hendrix would have added a lot more guitar tracks and polish to it if he'd had time to finish it properly. The rest of the stuff you've probably heard in one form or another before, just not these particular takes.  That said, if you are a hardcore Hendrix fan, there is still a lot to love.  The sound quality is phenomenal on most of these tracks, as they were mostly recorded in studio, yet a lot of them have the energy and excitement of live performances, making for some real stand-out performances.  The version of Lover Man, for instance, is the best I've heard, with all sorts of firey guitar playing with the loose ferocity of a live performance but the pristine sound quality of the studio.  Hear My Train A'Comin is phenomenal as well.  The instrumental of Sunshine of Your Love is pretty loose, but has some fantastic moments too.  So far, though, the show-stopper for me is Jimi's cover of Elmore James' Bleeding Heart.  Upon my first listening or two, I kind of dismissed it, but now I'm hooked on it.  Just a fantastic, raw, incendiary and loose performance, but with the perfect sonic polish of the studio.  This isn't a great place to start if you're just getting into Hendrix, but if you're a Hendrix fan who is dying for more, this is definitely worth getting.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|James Cameron, my hats off to you for this brilliant achievement that absolutely deserved to win best picture. The academy awards hold far less weight for me now and I trust the Golden Globes more. But I really want the maximum length of this film. I first saw Avatar, the 2:55 version, then it was reduced to the 2:30, but I hear there is a 3:14 and this is my preference. I will hold off on any purchase of the DVD until then.
B003FSTN52|5.0|Margolis gives a fascinating, very sympathetic performance as a smart, accomplished woman, a more-than-competent lawyer, loving mother, accomodating daughter-in-law, and betrayed but tenuously hopeful wife. She is a model of self-restraint, self-respect, and compassion.  You cannot help but watch her face every second she is on the screen. Noth is the ambitious, attractive, self-indulgent, man-of-the-people politician who wants to come back home after a very public number of sexual and possibly ethical missteps have landed him in jail and alienated his family.  More than that, he desperately wants to regain the trust and love of all the people he betrayed. The writing is superb!  I can't wait to see what will happen every Tuesday.  The private investigator is indeed a riveting character:  whose side is she on?  has SHE had her own affair with Noth?  is she loyal to the good wife? what's up with those 6 inch heeled thigh high leather boots?  The only problem I've had with the show is the frequent mid-season replays. But if this helps them keep up their excellent writing, I'll be patient. If you couldn't already tell, I highly recommend this!
B002VECM6S|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised after I saw this film. I had low expectations (Tim McGraw is in it for crying out loud) and have never been a stellar Sandra Bullock fan. However, this movie is breathtaking and really makes you appreciate what you have in life.  Although Bullock won an Oscar for her role (which I feel should have went to Meryl Streep), I feel that the academy overlooked Quinton Aaron's performance as Michael. Aaron's performance as a soft spoken and gentle boy, who has had to overcome many obstacles in life, is what makes this movie. Bullock plays a Southern Belle who struts around in high heels and tight outfits- hardly a stretch for anyone to play. Yet it is not Bullock's character that makes this film- it is how the kindness of strangers can go a long way and make such a difference. This movie has heart.  People will be reminded that everyone needs a helping hand, regardless of what predicament they are in.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|For starters I would just like say that I am amazed at how many people believed this release would be in 3D. Apparently these ignorant people could care less to investigate what the Blu-Ray release would contain before the release or how the film was made, let alone read the Amazon page that specifically states it `IS NOT IN 3D'. The 3D used for Avatar is new technology and not some gimmicky \\"popping-out-at-you\\" crap that is normally associated with 3D movies. As a result, Fox cannot do what Spy Kids 3D did and include cheap cardboard-frame, blue and red lens glasses. Avatar 3D will require more memory the blu-ray disk, a new 3D television (which is not even released commercially yet) that will cost thousands of dollars along with a new 3D Blu-ray player. Which brings me to my next point; there are no extras contained in this release and for good reason, to provide the best picture and audio quality possible and many have already commented that the Blu-ray version's quality is one of the best out of any film to be released in that format. I would prefer to have excellent film quality then a bunch of extras that I would watch of all of once, if that. Besides, many of the extras that would be included are of similar style to the ones already on Youtube. This version was obviously for those who don't have money to burn to purchase another television and blu-ray player. And for heads up, the release in November will not contain 3D either. Just a low quality version with tons of pointless extras that will inevitably make it costs more money. I don't understand some people. Purchase this version and then hold out for the 3D version which will also have extras when you have the money to get all the new hardware that is necessary to actually watch it in 3D. Anyways here is my brief summary of the story:<br /><br />Avatar is a wonderful film about an indigenous species (Na'vi) that is being forcibly removed from its home by Humans for a precious material, Unobtainium (a real term) which is contained underneath. Jake Sully, a former marine, sustained a major injury in Venezuela which has left him paralyzed without the resources to afford surgery. He is contacted by the Resources Development Administration about the murder of his twin brother Thomas. Jake is informed that his twin brother was working on the Avatar Program, assigned with the task of creating remotely controlled bodies that are a hybrid of a designated human operator and Na'vi DNA. The only person who is able to control the late Thomas's avatar is Jake himself because of his DNA match. Thus, Sully is persuaded by RDA agents to take an almost 6 year cryogenic travel to Pandora where he is introduced to his avatar and the Na'vi people. Once there, Sully is confronted with the task of assisting RDA in extracting Unobtainium by whatever means deemed necessary. However, he discovers the beauty of the world of Pandora and its indigenous organisms and encounters conflict with what is expected of him and what he knows to be ethical. The film follows this journey of conflict and James Cameron and his team creates a highly detail world that causes you to care for the characters and the world that is Pandora--finding yourself actually rooting against your own species.which is contained underneath.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|I don,t know how Hurt Locker won best picture over Avatar. Four stars , 2 thumbs up!Who cares about special effects, The movie is spectacular enough. People today are spoiled . Most deleted scenes are deleted for a reason, mostly they are boring, do not fit right in the movie.This is one of the best movies in my collection. If you went to see it in the theaters you would get no special effects. Get over it!!!! I didn,t see it in 3D, and really don,t care if I ever do. A movie as good as this doesn,t really need to be 3D.
B002UD56I6|5.0|This DVD clearly shows what a tragic loss the world experienced with the death of Michael Jackson.  One can only marvel when comparing his talent at 50 against the \\"talent\\" on American Idol or guest performances by other performers and this DVD is excellent in showing his incredible gifts.  I was not much of a fan before I viewed this film but now I'm a believer.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|This was one of my favorite books when I was little, and now it is a favorite of my daughter's as well.  We all love this movie because of that connection, but also because it's not a page-for-page rehash of the book. The storyline starts with the book but expands on it (the book plot is just too short to make an entire movie).  Even so, we think it captures the flavor of Roald Dahl perfectly.  The animation is quirky and fun in how retro-looking it is. The scenes of the characters digging was so funny because 1) it's not very realistic and 2) if you look at the pictures in the book, that's just what they look like.  I highly recommend this movie!
B001OQCV6A|1.0|Robert Downey Jr has made quite the name for himself over the years. However, I find myself disliking his performance in Sherlock Holmes. He was not as eccentric as I hoped he would be.  I went into this film with overly high expectations and came out feeling extremely disappointed.  I even saw this film twice just to make sure I wasn't having a bad day when I saw it the first time. Maybe its Guy Ritchie's vision, but this was not at all what I was expecting Sherlock Holmes to be. I found the casting of this film to be a bit peculiar. I didn't feel that Downey and Jude Law really had any chemistry and Rachel McAdams felt more like an annoying little sister rather then a former love of Holmes. The story line is hardly anything to rave about it and I felt bored throughout the entire movie. It's extremely predictable and the twist is nothing that surprising. Of course, I am extremely picky with movies and hardly seem to like anything.
B002S0OBN2|5.0|We are all so familiar with the Phantom of the Opera score, it was going to be a hard sell to equal it. If ALW did not equal his original he got very close with LND. The melody and lyrics in the major numbers are soaring and memorable. Some of the minor numbers are a bit long and possibly repetitive, my guess is they will change some of that with the rewrites the London show is undergoing. I enjoy listening to it and will in the future as was the case with the original. It is a quality recording with talented cast members. I did enjoy the included DVD, \\"the story so far\\" always interesting and included at a minimal cost, actually no extra charge if you considered it met the criteria for free shipping if that was your choice. I would recommend it to all the \\"Phans\\" out there without reservation.
0393320928|5.0|I've enjoyed this book immensely. The style is light and easy to read.  Feynman and his antics have inspired me to look at the world with curiosity and not to take myself too seriously. This is a book of life experiences, not technical science, so any reader can appreciate it.
1401203078|2.0|I really enjoy Alan Moores work normally. the LofEG is an excellent original series. But this book is just ramblings of an old mad sex crazed man. I'm sorry i read this book, i feel it has ruined my opinion of his work.

B002ONC9NC|5.0|WOW! This is truly one impressive film that deserves recognition and is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. I am not a Nick Hornby fan by any means, but I was truly in awe of this story he created. I hope he continues to write more scripts like this! Carey Mulligan, who plays Jenny, is a captivating actress and is going to make quite the name for herself someday. She is not just a pretty face- she has a talent too!  Originally, what allured me to watch this film was because Peter Sarsgaard, who plays David, was in it. Sarsgaard is one of the better actors in Hollywood and never gets the recognition he deserves. However, that might be a good thing considering how he always seems to amaze me in his roles (except for The Orphan- honestly, I don't know why he did that film). He is brilliant, deceptive, and extremely polished in this role as the love interest of Jenny, the 16 year old Oxford bound student who wants nothing more than to wear black, smoke cigarettes, and speak French.  The fact that this movie made me speechless is quite remarkable. It is a coming of age story that reminds us that no matter what the cost, life is truly an education and we cannot plan it out no matter how hard we try.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|This movie had been recommended over and over at Netflix due to other movies I had watched but I kept passing it buy not feeling very drawn in by the summary. Finally, I gave in (but read a few reviews first, just to get a better feel). I admit I'm disappointed I didn't give this a chance sooner because it's so wonderful I could have watched it five times by now. Like the other reviewers as I said I passed it by and like those reviewers I'm glad I finally gave it a chance. I had been so disappointed with other period pieces lately that I didn't want to be so again. I was very much the opposite. Mr. Thornton rivals Mr. Darcy from Pride & Prejudice for my affections. The character was so scary at first but as you get to know him from a new point of view you respect and admire him for his determination and honesty. His faults only serve to make him human which makes him all the more wonderful. The chemistry with Margaret was undeniable. Every meeting was charged with an electricity I'd not seen in some time. You can't help but love them both and their follies. As other's have said, if you loved Pride & Prejudice (preferably with Colin Firth) then you will love North & South (2004). I only wish I could buy a copy of the DVD this moment.
1579128149|5.0|I think it's just interesting to look at all the elements out there. Most of the time the closest student (myself included) simply do book problems and never get an idea of what certain elements look like. This book gives individuals a chance to learn about some of the not so common elements out there. This is not an extremely deep book but it sure is entertaining.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|500 Days of Summer is truly stunning! What I appreciate about  it is the fact that it is not your typical love story and engages the audience through Tom's (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) emotional roller coaster love affair with Summer (Zooey Deschanel). It's charming, charismatic, and has a killer sound track. But do not expect it to be a LOVE STORY. It showcases the complications of romances and examines the aspect of what a soul mate may or may not be. Levitt is casted perfectly and I feel that he is an actor that has done a remarkable job of overcoming the child star status and is making a name for himself. The audience will truly connect to his character and find him to be a vulnerable and sincere. Zooey Deschanel does a sensational job of playing Summer and her style reminds me of something you would find in an Anthropologie store- vintage, chic, and authentic. She glows and I didnt think I would like her in this role as much as I did.
0385504225|2.0|I didn't mind reading the book, but afterwards I had the following reactions:     1) The book is stuffed with unnecessary scenes and conversations; you could argue that about 1\2 of the book could be edited out.     2) Lousy characters:  Only the atagonist, Mal'akh, holds some interest as someone who has turned to the dark side.  The other characters are only place-holders, characters who exist to play a role in the story, but no one you'd like to meet, talk to, or ever see again.  Key point:  Director Sato, a sterotypical Japanese no-nonsense cigarette-smoking interrogator.  By the end of the long story, we know nothing new about her.  The same goes for Bellany, the Solomon siblings, and the rest of the characters.    3) Failed premise:  There is a secret word that holds the power of all wisdom buried somewhere, and everyone is trying to find it before Mal'akh does and becomes all powerful.  The conclusion shows the 'secret word' to be something so benign and common-place that there is no way it could be seen as earth-shattering to anyone. Even if it could be argued that the 'secret word' could help mankind, the fact is this 'word' has been studied and followed by billions of people for thousands of years, hardly anything lost or symbolic about it.  That the American Masons of the mid-19th century would create a labyrinth of encrypted clues to hide something so obvious strains belief (and disappoints the reader at the end of the book.)      4) Better movie than book:  Actually, I think the book will make a better movie than it does a read.  By slicing and dicing the story and eliminating the ponderous language and repetition that taints the book, the movie might be sharper, even though the end will no doubt be weak.  Bringing Mal'akh to life in all his tattooed, murderous glory should work well on screen.      In short, if you're a fan of Dan Brown, go ahead and read this book.  You might find part of it intriguing.  Otherwise, be prepared for a long, mostly 'filler' story that might just disappoint you.
B001GCUO5W|4.0|I'm not as huge a fan as most movie critics are of Martin Scorcese, but I do enjoy his films and was excited when I viewed the trailer for [[ASIN:0061703257 Shutter Island]], based on the novel by Dennis Lehane ([[ASIN:0060584750 Mystic River]]). And while I'm not the biggest Leonardo DiCaprio fan, I still consider him a good, serious actor.  And when I viewed the film, I was taken aback by Scorcese's cool visuals accompanied by a ridiculous score, which Scorcese and musician Robbie Robertson attempted to pull a \\"Tarantino\\" by mixing various style scores/compositions into scenes.  Unlike Quentin Tarantino's talent at this style, I found Scorcese and Robertson's picks to be completely out of place.  Whereas Tarantino scrounges every possible genre of music, this selection was still limited to music that had that cheesy 1950s horror film feel to it.  And I get why the filmmakers chose this music since the film does take place in 1954. However, the music becomes more of a distraction rather than a seamless, blending, artful, expressionistic character for filmmaking - the effect that any score should have on a film.<br /><br />All music aside, the film was good. The ending in no way lived up to the \\"twist-you'll-never-see-coming\\" status it was given by most movie critics and audiences, but it still was worthy of any mystery fan's money.  The acting is all spot-on with a great cast including Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Williams, Max von Sydow, Jackie Earle Haley, Patricia Clarkson, Emily Mortimer, Ted Levine, John Carroll Lynch, and Elias Koteas.  All of them great actors with very pivotal parts, yet, in my opinion, sadly, not used enough in the film. DiCaprio acts well enough but there is something slightly missing from this film, preventing it from being one of the year's best.<br /><br />I wish I could put my finger on what exactly is missing, but it's difficult to identify.  Scorcese pulls out all the stops and the filmmaking is sufficient, however, the story itself on celluloid is too outlandish and too pretentious.  The ending was open to interpretation but that's not what put me off - in fact, I liked the ending.  What put a bad taste in my mouth was the lack of explanation into how the entire surprising twist of a plotline could have been executed in the first place. For the sake of surprising the audience at the end, the filmmakers don't show or explain how our protagonist is placed in the position at the beginning other than simply alluding to a fact that the audience has to assume.  This may not sound like much to make the movie \\"so-so\\" but it is a big deal in terms of the story's progression, and should be treated as such. Also, being a father, I wasn't too crazy about the flashback scene involving kids.<br /><br />Nevertheless, \\"Shutter Island\\" does take a Hitchcockian twist and turns out a decent story. I am a fan of the novel's author, Dennis Lehane, because his stories are so cinematic and I love his attempt to mix film noir mystery with a period piece. And there are some movies based on books that although not as great as their literary companion are still great adaptations and worth watching (i.e., [[ASIN:B000F4LPJ6 Battle Royale: Director's Cut (Collector's Edition)]], [[ASIN:B002IYEQR4 Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:0785134352 Kick-Ass]], [[ASIN:B002CLBJV4 High Fidelity]], [[ASIN:B001MYIXAW Let the Right One In [Blu-ray]]]). However, this film unfortunately doesn't quite make that cut. If you've read the book, the movie will be somewhat of a disappointment only because the book (when it first came out and I read it) was so surprising and great. But, maybe that's the rub; if you read the book, there's almost no need to see this film 'cause most of the book was put on screen.  The movie's \\"Good\\" status -- rather than \\"Great\\" -- is not because of the acting or directing, which are both satisfactory - it's simply the adaptation.  Acting and directing: satisfactory; story structure: mediocre.<br /><br />Scorcese has always had an artistic take on film and moviemaking, whether he's shooting the grimy, grainy black-and-white world of a boxing ring, or the flashy, colorful casinos of the Vegas mob. He's an icon in the truest sense of the word. His take on Dennis Lehane's 1950s-set thriller is a new territory for him and he shoots it well. The story is a must for any noir mystery thriller fiction fan, but viewing the movie should only come after experiencing the ultimate \\"director's cut\\" -- the book.s had an artistic take on film and moviemaking, whether he's shooting the grimy, grainy black-and-white world of a boxing ring, or the flashy, colorful casinos of the Vegas mob.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|I don't know why everyone's complaining; I'm spending $20 for a Blu-Ray (and DVD I guess) that I'll watch multiple times.  As opposed to  paying $60+ (or whatever they jack the price to) for the same movie, 20 minutes of scenes that weren't deemed good enough for the original cut, and special features I might watch once... oh, and a pretty case...  Seems like an easy decision to me.
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|It's Disney....it's cute, there's songs and it's fun!  In my opinion it is a bit too dark and scary for little ones.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|This release is the movie only, no special features, no extras, no nothing. Absolute waste of your money unless you don't care about special features.
B001HN69AY|5.0|The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is a very clever critique of the Catholic Church. I am a little surprised that nobody has noticed this.    First, we have to remember that Terry Gilliam, along with Monty Python, has always made fun of the Catholic faith (Life of Brian, Monty Python and the Holy Grail), so it is not strange that he comes back to that theme again.     Of course, the devil is in the picture, but so is God (Dr. Parnassus). Tony is the \\"corporate\\" Jesus that \\"changes the business\\" from a simple carnival attraction to a bigger enterprise (his Foundation) that goes after rich ladies. Valentina's character portrays humankind, tempted by the Devil and Jesus at the same time.    All the metaphors are there in plain sight (even the crucifixion, with Tony's hanging and self induced resurrection). But Gilliam leaves room for an honest Jesus: Anton (I think it is not casual that Tony and Anton names are variations of Anthony).     SPOILER ALERT: The fact that Valentina finally choses Anton is Gilliam's total rejection of what Catholic Church has become. (The movie even has Colin Farrell's Tony hitting a kid for telling the truth!).    Finally, Gilliam has God becoming a puppeteer, in another not so hidden metaphor.    Another clever movie from Terry Gilliam.
0679882820|5.0|My daughter is about 6 months old, and this is by far her favorite book. Although my parents read me a great deal of Dr. Seuss when I was growing up, I had never heard of or seen this book until I found it as a bright and early board book at Toys'R'Us. I'm very glad that I decided to buy it, because Mr. Brown Can Moo has quickly become my daughter's favorite book. A lot of the other books will easily lose her attention, but because of all the fun sounds that are in this book she stays interested from beginning to end. I highly recommend this for parents of very young children. This book is also likely to get a small child/baby laughing, which is always nice to hear. :) I'm planning on buying copies for all of my friends who are having babies as a birth present.
0307473465|4.0|I listened to Campbell Scott read this to me; funny since the main charachter spends much of his time reading aloud.  This is a short, bittersweet love story which posed an intriguing moral question.  I am glad I had the opportunity to listen to this book and will see the movie soon.
0545140315|5.0|The \\"Lonely Hearts Club\\" is a cute story played by a bunch of nice girls and boys you might have happened to know in your life, maybe at high school. I noticed how amazing it has been to find behaviours and characters I've been experiencing in my life. From my point of view (I am a boy), reading this book is not only about going back to my high school years, but also about unwinding the thread that has led me to know something about girls and their mind. Yes, since this novel is not simply a teenagers' story or other things you can read in other reviews, but basically a funny manual about what's behind the behaviours of women, about the code women use to have themselves understood by us men. Well, of course it's not always that kind of easy and the numerous amusing situations and misunderstandings in the novel can show it.  I loved every character in the story having both a positive and a negative role. I suggest you should focus on everyone, since there's a lot to learn and understand from every character: starting from Penny Lane, the main protagonist, so true about what women behave, guess and can be, getting through Nate, Penny's self-absorbed first boyfriend, and then through Todd, a kind of funny primitive guy who is scared by girls thinking with their own mind; but I would like to make a special mention to Diane and Ryan, the two guys who remain best friends after breaking up. If you are interested in knowing better what friendship and gratitude mean, read about and learn from Diane: she makes Penny Lane overcome her suffering and makes her give her best to the Club; she is the person who remains close to Ryan after a break-up as a friend and manages to make him ... ok, I don't say anything else about it, otherwise I'll tell you the whole story. But let me finally mention Ryan, so perfect and flawless outside and so suffering inside; the kind of guy everyone could guess he is absolutely happy but who suffers terribly from the lack of true love from his father. I have been looking up to Ryan throughout the story, resisting all the worst that a scared and in love Penny Lane pours on him, revealing the flaws and the weaknesses he does have because of his love for Penny: \\"...that Ryan...great guy,uh?\\" says Dr.Bloom and I cannot say anything else but quite agree with him!   Please, read this book and know the other characters: they are amusing and very close to reality and don't hesitate to read it again if you don't focus well on some of them. You will feel positive and get satisfied!
B000002O51|5.0|How considerate of them to make their first three albums their best.  This greatly simplifies selecting albums for your collection.  Unlike many other groups (and, no, I won't mention the Stones,) Tom and Brad had the decency to realize that they could say what they had to say in their first few albums.  Boston's subsequent albums are simply a waste of your money.  Anyway, their debut album is definitely the best, followed by \\"Third Stage\\" and then \\"Don't Look Back.\\"  While DLB included the excellent title song, the album as a whole sounded like a rush job.  (Tom often confirmed that this was actually the case.)  While we do indeed have Boston to blame for the excesses of Foreigner, Styx, Journey, REO Speedwagon, Kansas, and others, I can't hold that against them.  \\"Third Stage\\" remains an excellent album, with at least four of their most memorable songs.  The only real problem with this CD is that, for a variety of reasons, it has never been remastered by Tom as it ought to have been. (For those familiar with the story of this album, they will understand.  It sounds to me like the source material may not be that much better than what was used for the original album and CD.)  If you don't own this album, you should.
0061537969|5.0|This story is told by a dog, Enzo, and is wonderful; it really makes you believe a pet might perceive the world as Enzo tells it.    I received for my brithday from my Aunt and enjoyed it so much I hardly put down.  I am getting ready to order Garth Stein's other books to see if I love as much.    Don't have to be an animal liker or lover to enjoy the story line.
0307454886|4.0|Best line in the book:<br /><br />Living in a country like ours, whose key documents are all about emancipation, all directed at guaranteeing individual liberty, living in a free system that is basically indifferent to how you behave as long as the behavior is lawful, the misery that comes your way is most likely to be self-generated!
B000W91RUG|5.0|Love the show and love the DVD. Wish there were more out takes on the DVD, but the commentary by the actors is excellent. When I was growing up there was a difference between a geek and a nerd. Both were mostly socially unacceptable, but the nerd was smart and the geek was not. These days they are pretty much interchangeable. These characters are truly the nerds of nerds. Yet, even these alpha nerds have other nerds that they look up to. I always thought it interesting that nerds were mostly avoided in High School, but they were sought out in College. And like the show, the nerd got the pretty and smart girl.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|There are a lot of people on here who have gone out their way to complain about this movie. Whatever your opinion is on the story, the visuals are revolutionary. While it's true this is a very bare disc, which only contains the film. The transfer is pristine and they really did utilize nearly the entire capacity of the BD format for video and audio fidelity. I've seen nothing better on the format. The bitrate on this blu-ray peaks near 50Mbps at times, average is around 30. Most other very good BD movies are in the 22Mbs range, so you're seeing something special here. The DTS-HD audio track can provide the volume and punch that I recall in the IMAX theater.    I enjoy the movie a lot. I don't think it's story is a classic but the presentation is and I think it's worth having in your collection. Especially if you're a picky about the technical qualities of your media :) It would be nice if we could have an extras disc with HD content instead of a \\"DVD\\" copy of the film, which is a nice throw in, but certainly not what a blu-ray enthusiast would prefer. Fox has a very valuable franchise here, so I don't blame them for milking it, but it does get a bit excessive. I'll probably just rent the next release to check out the extras. I doubt we'll see a better transfer of the 2D version of this film so I'm pleased with this blu-ray. I'm glad I got see this movie in 3D a couple of times. It transfers well to the home experience on a standard 2D set.
0375842209|5.0|I read this for my young adult literature class. It was fast paced and has a very important (and different) narrator. The book talks about Nazi Germany but also about the growth of a young girl. And what book lover doesn't want to know more about the book thief?
