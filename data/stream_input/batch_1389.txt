B005FITILO|5.0|Mavis Gary is the ghostwriter for a fading series of Y.A. novels.  Aware of the depression she is sinking into (but not exactly of how far into it she's already gone), Mavis thinks of the happiest time of her life: when she was in high school, dating the popular boy, Buddy Slade.  Despite the fact that Buddy has a wife and new child, Mavis heads back to the small town of Mercury to reclaim the lost days of her youth.<br /><br />It's a basic, even boring premise, yet Jason Reitman's YOUNG ADULT captures the complexities of depression/self-discovery perfectly, ripe with all the awkward moments, self-loathing, and even humor that goes along with it.  To call YOUNG ADULT a comedy would be doing it a disservice, as it is far more than that: it's an intricate, layered character study, anchored by Charlize Theron's lead performance.  That Theron wasn't even nominated for a Best Actress Oscar is almost a tragedy; the same can be said for Patton Oswalt, who goes from stand-up comedic to dramatic actor as the flip-side of Mavis: a kid who was largely ignored, even picked on, with tragic results.  Theron and Oswalt give deep, mesmerizing performances; also strong are Patrick Wilson (a grossly-underused actor) as Buddy, and Elizabeth Reaser as his wife.  Reitman, as usual, handles his actors perfectly, working from another solid script by Diablo Cody.  This is the team that brought you JUNO, yes, but this is definitely a film for adults--for only adults can know the pain of discovering that who you see when you look in the mirror is only a glimmer of who you are.  Uncomfortable at times, hilarious at others, YOUNG ADULT is not a film to be missed, under any circumstances.
006197806X|5.0|In Lauren Oliver's sequel to Delirium, Pandemonium was full of surprises and anticipation that it will want you to read the next one! I loved how the story went from Now and Then because we got to see Lena start to be stronger and why she went to New York. Alex is not in this book unfortunately. I loved Alex! Through staying with the Wilds she develops herself and becomes and even smarter/stronger character because living outlawed is hard because you have to live and survive the winter. I cried during this book through one scene because it was soo heartbreaking with that certain storyline.<br /><br />Pandemonium also introduces us to some new characters like Raven who is the leader of the group who takes in Lena and transforms her into a strong character, into a NEW Lena. Along with Raven and many more very interesting characters! The sequel really was fantastic because it showed a new side to Lena we never saw before. With her sudden loss and was thinking Alex was dead after what happened in Delirium. I even started to like Julian (another love interest) he was one of those people with good looks and personality. Lauren Oliver has a way with words because I really loved the book! It was a whirlwind of  emotions and action that could not be contained!!<br /><br />The ending was OMG OMG when does the next book (Requiem) come out!! Like any Lauren Oliver ending it was a cliffhanger.... but this is going to be a LONG wait until we read the last book in this amazing trilogy. I loved everything about this book, the writing, action and even the romance. If you haven't started this series, start it today!! Its one of those books you cannot put down! I was soo addicted it only took me 1 day. Be sure to pick up Pandemonium at your store because it was Amazing!!

B0015F1VY8|5.0|Honestly I am shocked that this only has a 3.5 star rating. I think it was beautifully filmed, with tasteful and moving music. It seemed to focus on the light side of Elizabeth, and showed her sense of humor, strength, and deep loving side. It also refrained from multiple gruesome torture / execution scenes you usually get in films from this time period. Cate Blanchet is incredible in the role, and made me put QE1 on my list of people I wish I could meet.

1612130607|1.0|When you two are done having sex which is about 23 hours of the day, and if Ana can still walk, please seek professional help. And remember to leave all of the kinky toys and bondage at home. You two have too many weird mood changes to be normal. Christian, you are so hot, and so rich, that a majority of the reviewers just love you, and are willing to put up with anything you want to dish out. They consider you an Alpha Male and think it's cool that you like your women submissive. And to them, Ana is so sweet because she has no spine, and would do whatever dear hot Christian wants. Ana is the epitome of submissiveness! Poor Christian who had a terrible childhood needs a lot of TLC, so if he tells you to lay down and roll over, you do it because he is hot and rich! Oh, and if you decide to seek help you are going to have to learn words other than - Oh my, blushes, smirks, jeez, laters babe, my inner goddess, the 3 or more Holy's, mutters, whispers and all the rest, including HOT or they may want to commit you to a mental institution. And please don't constantly widen your eyes, roll your eyes, or bite your lip while you are there or it might annoy the person who is trying to help you.<br /><br />As for the writing, I shudder to think of the grades I would have gotten from my English teachers/professors had I turned in papers with so many repetitive words. On the other hand, someone like Christian would have probably gotten away with it because he is so HOT! Had I not wasted enough money on these books (my fault for listening to the hot air publicity), I would have used it and bought a Thesaurus for both the woman who wrote the book and the publishing company. Unlike Ana, sex didn't leave me without a brain. And unlike the people who sold the books, reading all the sex scenes that were written did not damage my eyesight, therefore I was still able to see the words that were used way too many times.

B0034G4P4Y|3.0|I don't know if it's just me, but in all fairness, I found Tintin to be like a big, greasy burger from McDonalds. Sure it has the power to tempt you with its big lettuce and cheese and tomatoes and it's juicy patty... But even despite the yumminess of the burger, it's a dull experience overall as you've devoured nothing of actual substance.<br /><br />I'll admit, for the first thirty minutes of Tintin, I was hooked. I hadn't read a single comic book, watched a single cartoon or even encounter a piece of literature that bore the name \\"Tintin\\" as a child, so this was all new experience to me. Unfortunately, the fun only lasted for thirty minutes. About two hours later, I left the cinema not only feeling dazed from all the 3D effects and always moving camera shots, but also wondering why they even bothered to try to make CG animated film out of something that clearly looked as if it wasn't meant to be a film.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong guys. I don't mean any disrespect to Stevie S, as he is a fantastic filmmaker and has made dozens of fantastic films throughout his career. But frankly, Tintin was just... Boring.<br /><br />I think the biggest problem lies in its protagonist. Tintin is a very empty character and almost a Gary Stu. Everything seems to go exactly as planned for him and he seems to have no weaknesses or defaults. I'll remind you yet again that I didn't know anything about Tintin before going in, so I'm not sure if I missed the point of anything but really... He was just a dull character, and not interesting enough to warrant an entire movie based around him.<br /><br />It really is a shame because Haddock, his partner was a fun and quirky character, and kept me watching. And the spine tingling chillingness of Daniel Craig's Saccharine was just mesmerizing, gorgeous to watch even and how he played the evil character nicely. So... Couldn't the movie's own damned protagonist do anything to show he's worthy of a movie?<br /><br />I also don't know of this is just me, but I could tell the writers were trying to force too many eggs into one basket. I have no idea what stories this takes inspiration from but I just feel like this was just a bunch of stories mashed together with no cohesion.<br /><br />However, at least it looked pretty. At least it gave me something to look at when I wasn't trying to wrap my head around the not very interesting story, or how many of those there were. Alas, this is a film I could see myself putting on at parties as a background type thing, you know? But if I were to try and sit through the film again, I'd have a headache from it all. So I guess my review should be a 3/10... But it did look pretty, so I'll give it a 5. For one it could have been a lot worse.<br /><br />Hey, for one, we could have gotten another \\"Immortals\\" with this one. At least we didn't.

0425221806|3.0|The premise of this book is that two creatures break loose from a top secret research genetic testing lab. One is a golden retriever as smart as a person (for govt use in spying) and the other a misfired attempt at a super killing animal for the military, which is like a cross between a baboon and a wolf. The Outsider, as the killer animal is known, is pretty smart too, but also out-of-control and so insanely jealous of the favored golden retriever that it vows to hunt it down and kill it. The animals are somehow synched geographically in an unclear psychic bond that lets them sense when the other is near. While on the hunt for the retriever, the Outsider occasionally performs gruesome murders and mocks officials with scary tricks. Sound hoky enough yet?<br />Wait there's more. The person who finds the golden retriever is lonely and depressed, but the incredible dog revives his zest for life. Then he falls for a beautiful young woman who has almost never left her house her whole life because of her recently deceased overly protective aunt. The man and woman fall for each other, at the fervent encouragement of the dog, amid incredibly cheesy dialogue. The dog explains his situation and fear of being taken back to the lab or caught by the Outsider, so they go on the run. Meanwhile the Feds and a street smart but insane hit man are hot on their trail.<br />So there you have it. When you explain the plot of this book, you realize how strange, nonsensical, unrealistic and contrived it is, but the funny thing is the storyline still managed to keep me interested and reading to the end. Koontz's writing is somewhat stilted and robotic at times, but he basically keeps things moving along and fun. If you can suspend your disbelief for awhile, this book can be a decent yarn. Bonus points for dog lovers.
B004UXUX7S|2.0|Look guys, I did get the movie...it's just, I didn't like it. Alright, I'm not sure if I'm putting it the right way. I liked lots about it, but I also disliked lots about it.<br /><br />Actually, I'm not sure if \\"lots\\" is the right word either. This is one maddening film.<br /><br />First off, I am more then familiar than Alex Payne. After all he did do my favourite movie of 2005, Sideways. However I absolutely hated About Schmidt. I thought it was boring tripe, but I decided to put that aside and watch it on the strength of Sideways alone. And boy, was I dead wrong.<br /><br />The film follows a real estate agent in Hawaii, Matt King, whose wife has ended up in a bad accident that has thrust her into a near death state. With the tragedy affecting his already broken family, he reunites with his bitchy teenage daughter, who spends the movie with some douchebag I couldn't for the life of me care about. She reveals that his wife had an affair with a rival agent of his, which leads him to seek him out to confront him face to face, and seal the deal on a piece of land he owns.<br /><br />First off, I liked Clooney. He was the film, and without him I would have been bored outright. He's the one thing keeping it watchable. Oh, and it was shot beautifully too.<br /><br />But... The film just bored me.<br /><br />First off, it's SO PREDICTABLE. I predicted the whole thing with the land and how Matt would decide he wanted to keep the land instead of selling it. I predicted how he'd fall for Speer's wife. I predicted that Speer had a wife and kids too. Seriously, how did you not see it coming?<br /><br />The characters were boring as hell. The only memorable one was Beau Bridges and he was only in the film for 6 minutes. Speer was so clich&eacute;d in terms of development.<br /><br />Oh, and worst of all- it was so full of clich&eacute;s. You can tell how it's going to end from the opening scene, and you can essentially think to yourself \\"I think this is going to happen\\" and -gasp- it does!<br /><br />But, it is prettily shot. I guess that's all that's needed to constitute Oscar bait nowadays. This isn't a bad film but it has every right to be, and the fact that it is up against The Artist for best picture is just laughable, because The Artist really does deserve the award. Don't kid yourself. This film is really forgettable.s!<br /><br />But, it is prettily shot. I guess that's all that's needed to constitute Oscar bait nowadays.

B001PPLJJ0|5.0|The Reader is set in Germany and the opening scene takes place in 1958. Michael Berg (Kross) is 15 years old and becomes ill on his way home from school. He's helped by Hanna Schmitz (Winslet), who cleans up his mess and ensures that he makes it home. Three months later, he's well enough to go and thank her, and they begin a brief, but intense affair.<br /><br />Hanna appears moody and is quick to anger, but it doesn't usually last for long. There are some fairly graphic sex scenes, although the behavior does fit the characters well. Hanna loves having Michael read to her and it becomes part of his visits. She insists that he read before they have sex.<br /><br />After a while, the affair ends and Michael isn't sure why Hanna left. We see him moving on with his life and studying law in college. Part of his course involves a trip to see a real trial and Michael is stunned to see Hanna among a group of six women who are being charged with war crimes. I only mention this because it's revealed in the trailer. The Reader is not a war film, it's a character study of the effects war can have on people throughout their lives.<br /><br />Imagine being in that situation. Your first experience of sex is something you never forget. It's a very intense memory because it's tied to strong emotions. Michael has a dilemma because he has a piece of information which would help Hanna's case. The problem is, she hasn't volunteered the information herself. Should he allow her to make that decision, or should he present the evidence to ensure that justice is done?<br /><br />The story frequently jumps from 1958 and 1966 to 1995, where Michael (Fiennes plays the older version) is now a successful lawyer. We see how his experience as a child has affected his life. He's unwilling to allow people to get close to him, whether it's a sexual partner or his own daughter.<br /><br />I'm not going to reveal any more of the story because it would ruin the experience if you're watching it for the first time.<br /><br />The acting is superb throughout. Winslet won the Oscar for her performance which spanned 30 years of Hanna's life. It can't have been an easy part to play with the frequent nudity and the strong subject matter. I don't think I have seen a better Winslet performance. Fiennes and Kross are also convincing as Michael Berg. Michael's college professor is played by the always excellent Bruno Ganz, and I loved his subtle performance.<br /><br />If you enjoy good writing and emotional drama with fully-developed characters, The Reader is worth your time.rst time.<br /><br />The acting is superb throughout.

B003CSV7TK|5.0|[[ASIN:B000HT3PPG Miracle on 34th Street (Special Edition)]] This movie is the best one to watch with children that are questioning the reality of Santa, since it gives a foundation to the fact that we can believe in what we want. As they get older, children seem to lean toward the belief that there is no Santa, thus removing the \\"fun\\" of the holiday. The idea that a big man with a white beard and a jolly laugh will bring you gifts if you are good is a long-time belief that keeps kids wondering, as they try to \\"be good\\" so they'll get their just rewards. When that belief is gone, the holiday joy is also gone. This movie shows just this.<br /><br />The little girl in the movie is not a believer to begin with, but the arrival of Kris Kringle and events that transpire during the movie have her changing her belief by the end of the movie. The movie plot is enjoyable every year, no matter how many times it's shown on TV. Owning the movie means you won't have to wait until one of the stations decide to show it - you can make that decision yourself!<br /><br />We hope you can have the same enjoyment from this movie that our family has had.

B003ASLJMW|5.0|Set in the midst of the Cold War, we have the troubled Vietnam Vet being 'conscripted' by an ungrateful US government to steal a prized USSR stealth war plane. Simple, uncomplicated plot, with the baddies (the Russians) being trumped yet again by the goodies (the good old USA). Apart from the steely acting by Eastwood, who looked so wound up that if he sneezed he would shatter, the balance of the main characters were British! And very good they were too, with the eccentric boffin superb played by Freddie Jones, and the Jewish scientist played by Nigel Hawthorne. Perhaps one might argue that that sometimes the acting tended more towards the ham than Hamlet, but overall it kept me on the edge of the proverbial seat, even after watching it many times before. And nary a sex scene to be seen, nor a swear word to be heard! What a pleasure when compared with today's efforts with the hero jumping from bed to bed, etc etc. To misquote Freddie, 'A damn good show!'

B004J4RQIM|5.0|I am a huge fan of David Foster and I originally bought the first Hit Man on DVD.  I enjoyed the show so much that I had to have the Blu Ray version for archiving purposes and gave the DVD to my parents.  As soon as I found out that a second concert Blu Ray was available,(Hit Man Returns) I purchased it immediately.  I have since watched it twice now and each time I am blown away at how wonderful this concert is.  The biggests highlights for me were watching Natalie Cole perform, she brought old hollywood class to the show, Ne-Yo, whom I have a newfound admiration for, Charice blew me away and lastly, Donna Summer who sounds AMAZING.  Do not hesitate to buy this disc and share your viewing experience with your friends.  We were actually clapping after some of the performances.  Oh yeah, Kenny Loggins is HOT for being an older guy and still sounds great.

After reading the first installment, I was hooked! I went out and bought volumes 2-15 in one shot. Yep, it's that good!<br /><br />The character development is phenomenal. You truly begin to empathize with many of the characters and their situations. When one of them is lost to the undead ghouls, you mourn right along with the others.<br /><br />In short, this is a fantastic series!

B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|They did a superb job in filling the female lead for this movie, she plays the part well. On the other hand she didn't have a lot script to work with, most of the story doesn't start (present time) till the middle of the movie. The first half is just filler and back story. I really liked it, and it seems they may try to make a sequel with the way the movie ended.

0316056863|3.0|hmmm... Where do I start?<br /><br />I should preface this review by saying that maybe the reason I did not fall in love with this book was because SOOO many people had hyped it up. Seriously, every one that talked about this book to me said, \\"Oh man, so funny I almost peed my pants every chapter.\\"<br /><br />So I quickly put my name on a wait list at the library and eagerly awaited the 2 months (yes, 2 months) for this book to arrive. (In an attempt to save money, I made the resolution to ONLY get books at the library this year).<br /><br />The only thing that came up in my mind as I moved from chapter to chapter was REALLY? THIS is what I waited all those months for? Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of light \\"ha\\" moments and even one in the early chapters where I could not stop laughing.<br /><br />To be fair, this is not the book's fault, rather my friends' inflated opinion of it (NOTE: now I know not to trust their opinions as to what will make you pee your pants). The book does have it's moments, enough so to give it the 3 stars that Amazon deems it being \\"OK\\".<br /><br />One thing I will complain about is Fey's constant reference to her scar. In early chapters she explicitly says that she DOES NOT like talking about it and won't give you any details about it. Yet, it literally comes up 3 or 4 more times throughout the book. Sorry, but that is something that really irritates me; when someone says they don't want to talk about something and yet it seems it's all they can talk about.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|If you want to enjoy this book and not whine and complain like every other review, then I want you to completely disregard the Summary.

B0068TL23G|5.0|This is my favorite puzzle game on Android! It can be very difficult. When you finally figure out the puzzle you feel like a genius!
B000063WDH|4.0|This is just my opinion. BK equals Fuzzy guitar with very very catchy intro riffs...but that's it. After the first verse and the chorus you would feel like something is definitely missing. These are 30 second songs with intro, verse and chorus repeated 4 times to make a 2-3 minute long song. It always feels like something is missing. My perfect description of the BK sound is Hendrix warming up for 2 minutes and then he fell asleep with a mix of CCR kinda type of intro licks but more fuzzy that quite never made it to the lead guitar part and the refrain part. I like my sludge blues/mississippi blues to have at least some lead guitar parts. They do have some leads but they often sound more of an adlib to the intro or verse riff. Maybe it's just me unable to appreciate change. One thing good BK always makes sure that they lay down some really nice and sludgy/thick grooves which for me will be a perfect groove to do some extended emotional, blistering, and melodic leads. .but there's none. Maybe a formula they are following or maybe they just need a real lead guitar player. Listen to CCR's Pagan Baby or Suzy Q for some quick example and to understand what I am saying. The singing part is a perfect fit for their sound. Still 3.5 t0 4 stars for honoring great music before them.

B00127RAJY|5.0|My husband and I were determined to get back in shape and change our eating habits, and of course I got on my usual kick of buying a bunch of workout gear and nutritious foods to get us started.  For the first time ever, I ordered this workout DVD from Jillian, and was so excited to try it out!  We have a 1-year old at home, so getting us both out to the gym has been difficult, so I figured this was more convenient.  My husband thought this was initially silly, until I was halfway through the first day, Level 1.  He disappeared upstairs, and as I was cooling down (I was DRENCHED!  And I thought I was in excellent shape, just got finished running a half marathon for crying out loud!) he came down all decked out in his workout clothes, wanting to try the workout.  We are now hooked.<br />I have moved to Level 2 (did so after 10 days, as most of the reviews have recommended) and already am looking forward to Level 3.  I initially thought Level 2 wasn't as hard, and while half of the exercises are \\"easier\\", the other half are still kicking my butt, and I'm only 6 days into Level 2.  My husband has reluctantly moved into Level 2, which targets more static poses while working out the upper body.  THIS IS NOT EASY!<br />We have both lost 14 pounds each.  In two weeks.  Now granted, we have been dieting pretty heavily (we're big South Beach fans, but that zaps your energy level during the first two weeks so this has been a struggle), but our strength, balance, and tone are visible.  She's not kidding on the DVD when she says \\"those of you on day 5 or 6 should be seeing the results.\\"  I promise you...YOU WILL!!<br />My friends are all now doing her workout as well, and I just ordered a couple more for when I'm done with the 30 Day Shred.<br />Thanks, Jillian!  I'm sold.  You are awesome, thank you so much for the inspiration and constant *ss-kicking!!
0142000655|5.0|Most people will never read \\"East of Eden\\". If they want to find out why John Steinbeck is celebrated as an American icon of the literary world they'll usually pick up something a little less daunting like \\"The Pearl\\", \\"Tortilla Flat\\" or one of his other smaller books. Even if they are willing to spend time on one of his more epic works, they usually turn to \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\". That is a shame, not because his other works are great; they certainly are that, but because \\"East of Eden\\" is a masterpiece that tackles the age old issue of the dual nature of man in a manner that we can all related to.<br />Where books like \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" and \\"Crime and Punishment\\", tackling the same issue, are weighty and hard to navigate (Don't get me wrong, they are worth the effort), \\"East of Eden\\" is engrossing and captivating. Using the story of Cain and Abel in Genesis not only as part of the story but as the basis for his characters Aaron and Caleb (Their father's name is Adam), Steinbeck explores the balance between wanting to do good and doing evil as well as the motivations behind them redefining them to make us look at both in a new light.<br />Cain, in the Bible, takes on a new life and I found myself able to understand better why he did what he did and oddly enough, relating to him. While I've never killed my brother (There are certainly times I wanted to!), I can understand the feelings of rejection he had that brought him to that place and, after all, I think that this is part of the reason it's in the Bible, not so that we can set ourselves above him but rather understand that the nature of Cain is in all of us and that God loves us in spite of it (Cain, after all, was protected by God. The \\"mark of Cain\\" wasn't to brand him a killer but rather to mark him as a man protected by God).<br />Steinbeck does, at times, ramble; the book is, granted, a daunting one but it is also a classic for a reason. Someone once said \\"We read to know that we are not alone\\" and Icouldn't agree more. There is a quote that I had stenciled on the wall of my study where my 3,000 volumes (and growing)reside which reads \\"The man who does not read good books has no advantage over the man who can't read them.\\" It is attributed to Mark Twain but it's questionable whether it came from him or not. Either way, it's true. If you are not illiterate (you wouldn't be able to read this if you were) than count yourself one of the blessed and fortunate, then, go one step further and pick up \\"East of Eden\\" and read a book that is not only a \\"good book\\" but a true masterpiece.
B002ZG983M|4.0|Personally I love this movie. It is a good guy bad guy comical (excuse the pun as this movie is about super heros based on \\"comic\\" book characters) real time hero escapdes with some strange twists mixed in. This may not suit everyone however I feel that most people will appreciate this kind of guandra being it is funny and entertaining. For this reason (if you are not into super heros and comic books) I gave it a 4 rating.

0385736002|5.0|I love this book. It is a good idea if you or the person you are sending it to as a gift is over 12. (like it says in the description)Not because it is a gory book or has bad words, it doesn't, because you will get much more out of the book if you have some knowledge of mythology.I have seen tons of characters and creatures pop up in different stories because they are all referenced in mythology. If you like the Harry Potter series, books by Rick Riordan, and/or the Artemis Fowl series, this will be a good book for you.

B003L16FAE|5.0|(EDIT) 12/19/2013. Now that Predator 3D has been released, I thought a brief update to this review might be useful.<br /><br />I was surprised at the quality of the 3D conversion, given that it used the automated JVC Fox workstation that was used for Jumper 3D and I, Robot 3D. The process costs about a third of what a typical catalog 3D conversion costs and can be done with about 3 people in 3 months. In contrast, Titanic took hundreds of people over a year to convert.<br /><br />The slow rate of adoption of 3D has been attributed, in part, to the lack of available content. Fox Home Entertainment with JVC developed a business model using automated equipment that allowed the 3D conversion of catalog movies profitably.<br />I was doubtful that they would be successful in this after watching 3D clips of I, Robot shortly after it was released. I changed my mind after purchasing and watching Predator 3D.<br /><br />The only caveat is that the extras are provided via a Disk two DVD. (Disk one is the 3D/2D disk which has no extras). It would have been better to include the Ultimate Hunter Edition Blu-ray as Disk two as they did for the European release, since it has several more extras, some of them in High Definition. (END EDIT)<br /><br />So, you have recently upgraded your home theater for blu-ray and want to replace your old Predator DVD. Should you buy the 2008 release or the 2010 (UHE) release? Perhaps I can help you decide.<br />When the 2008 edition was released, blu-ray disks were purchased primarily by film purists who believed nothing in the original film should be altered. Today, blu-ray is mainstream and the film purists represent only 4% of the market . Fox, in 2010 was intent on providing a release, Ultimate Hunter Edition, that catered to the tastes of the majority of consumers. The film purist minority is unhappy with that release as well.<br />I saw the movie in the theater when it was released in 1987. The graininess of the image was disturbing. After some research, I found that the film was shot with a film stock that, in low light conditions created an excessively grainy image and that it was not the filmmaker's intent to do that for artistic reasons.<br />I own both the 2008 and the UHE blu-rays and have compared them exhaustively. In my opinion, The UHE is the superior disk in terms of color accuracy and detail.<br />The last word from Fox on the Predator UHE blu-ray comes from Vincent Marcais, Sr. V.P. for International Sales in a taped interview.  \\"The film stock (source for the transfer) was poor. The criticism is unfair. The filmmaker's were consulted, which we always do while they are alive. The UHE is how the filmmaker's wanted it to look\\"<br />Lets put aside the fact that the UHE has 5 hours of supplemental information and the 2008 version has none; and the fact that the UHE uses a modern video codec (AVC MPEG 4 vs VC-1 for 2008) and has a higher bit rate, resulting in more potential detail.<br />Your choice if you consider yourself a film purist is the 2008 release. If you want to enjoy the movie as the director and cinematographer intended, your choice is the Ultimate Hunter Edition. If you are still conflicted, buy both.<br />In conclusion. I own both, but I only watch the Ultimate Hunter Editon.<br /><br />I would caution you about visiting other forums to help you make a purchasing decision. The people on those forums represent only 4% of those that purchase blu-ray disks today and most are biased in favor of the film purists view.<br /><br />Edit. 5/19/2012. I thought it might be interesting to some of you to read some technical details about the difficulty with the source used for the BD and the issue of director's intent:<br /><br />Perhaps this will put to rest any uncertainty about the director's intent regarding grain/grittiness.<br /><br />\\"As I think much has been said online seemingly `authoritatively' about the Director's intent and the use of the film \\"stock\\" to make Predator intentionally look gritty or grainy. Well, that's pretty much inaccurate speculation according to someone I recently spoke with intimately involved in the production.<br />The DP chose the Eastman Kodak stocks he did for the simple fact of capturing \\"usable\\" images on film under relatively low lighting conditions in the jungle...'grit' or `intentional' graininess was never intended in any artistic sense for `atmosphere'. If anything, it was an undesirable side effect of the acquisition because it caused \\"murkiness\\" esp. in the greys and blacks of dark jungle sequences and didn't allow the filmmakers the opportunity to cut the different stocks together in the same scene, which would have been nice to have had that flexibility. To give you an idea of the challenge, they were apparently restricted to shooting at a max. of only T2 in anything but high noon and the middle of the day.<br /><br />Don McAlpine shot the film with 35mm Kodak 5247 and 5294, depending on the lighting conditions available, with or without the aid of artificial light illumination. The '94 (400T) was used for really low lit conditions (like those night sequences in the ravine at the end which apparently were only getting 7 or 8 footcandles down there, with only 4 or 5 footcandles after the smoke starting flowing during the action) and the '47 (125T) stock was used for the set-ups involving wide clearances which had more natural light and as well, could be more easily illuminated with artificial light, when justified. You see, once you add artificial light in the deep jungle, all it accomplishes is lighting the foreground to such an excessive degree that it looks obvious and fake to audiences. Lighting considerations were where the real photographic `artistry\\", if you will, of the captured imagery took place, not in any consideration of grain being used for a `gritty' look.\\"<br /><br />Vincent Marcais Senior V.P. International Marketing, was asked about the policy when remastering catalog titles and specifically about Predator. The Fox executive acknowledges that they got a lot of criticism, \\"but I don't think it was deserved,\\" he countered, because the movie was shot on a film stock that wasn't good enough, and the Blu-ray version \\"represents what the filmmaker wanted it to look like.\\" He said that Fox discusses the issue of \\"removing grain or not\\" with the filmmakers, \\"as long as they are alive\\".<br /><br />Corporate Execs at this level are very careful about the statements they make for publication. There will be no remaster or new transfer of Predator in the foreseeable future based on his comment.

1933952806|3.0|Everything is covered in extreme detail. A good reference - glitzy - 75% of topics covered not generally used. Too much technology, but that's the way cameras are going. Just compare the adjustments offered on the D7000 to the Leica film cameras. In my view, the manual that comes with the camera is more than sufficient.
B007BLCGNU|2.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this movie but it ended up putting me right to sleep. The gay aspect is hardly in the movie at all ( unless I was asleep for it).

B0061P64VW|5.0|I don't own the deluxe edition so I can't comment on it compared to this SHM SACD release except to say that If you want the best sounding version of this classic album sans bonus tracks then you need to hear this. I don't pretend to know the science behind SHM or even SACD technology, nor do I care, all I know is what my ears tell my brain & they tell my brain that the SACD sounds superb. Three dimensional sound that reveals new detail I never thought possible, its like listening to the album & gaining a new perspective. No its not like hearing a remix, more like having the music really come to life, revealing more musical details previously buried deep in the mix & better separation between instruments. I won't go into a track by track analysis, suffice to say that this is a classic from beginning to end, maybe the Stones at their 70's peak & THIS is the version to own IMHO. 5 stars for music & 5 stars for sound. Check out other great Stones releases on SHM SACD as well, Tattoo You is excellent!! P.S Don't pay $85 for this title, it is available from CDJapan, HMV Japan or Amazon.co.jp for considerably less, as are almost all of the SHM SACD releases.

B004VSTP4Y|3.0|There is some mystery at the very end of the book. It's clear that Grace and Sam are together. Graces parents accept him as much as they can.  Their relationship seems all wrapped up in a nice little bow except for one thing.  Obviously during this book Grace was a wolf off and on for a lot of the book.  After hearing several times about Cole's theory of how the \\"wolf\\" works in the body, we are lead to believe that the cure they thought up might work.  In the end, we know that Grace will take the cure as a wolf in the winter in hopes to become human forever and suppress the wolf like Sam did.  We're left to assume what we want. It could really go either way.  Personally, how bubble gum the end was, I'll assume it worked and they lived happily ever after.  Did I just give away the end? Whoops.  LOL  You were warned.  Personally, since the ending was headed in the direction of roses and candy already, I would have preferred the author to go one step further and actually give us a solid ended.<br /><br />Bottom line, I liked it, but there wasn't much depth there.

B0025UHKNS|4.0|Would like to say that I am really enjoying this watch.  Without getting into too much detail - I had some issues with the first watch I received being able to connect to the ANT Adapter.  Amazon sent me a new watch right away and it was able to connect without any issues at all.  I would like to add here that Garmin's Customer Service and Technical Support were extremely helpful with troubleshooting the issue and determining that either the watch or the adapter were defective.  Amazon's customer service policy is a little better than Garmin's - They paid for the cost of shipping the defective watch back to them (Garmin wanted me to pay).<br />Now that I have a working watch, I am very pleased.  I haven't learned all of the functions but I know how to start the training mode and to upload my run's to the Garmin Connect website.  I still have not attempted to use the heart monitor.<br />I let my 12-year old run with the watch yesterday and she found it to be too sensitive (it kept changing modes, ect).  I haven't had that issue much (not sure what she was up to).<br />I would be happy to update this review once I learn more.<br />Thanks for asking.

0307387178|5.0|In \\"Into the Wild,\\" author Jon Krakauer has done a masterful job of plumbing the possible personality that might be moved to behaviors that on the surface appear to many of us as acts of suicidal insanity.  He does this by drawing parallels between his own younger days and Chris McCandless's as well as by looking at a few other examples from history.  Writing with a sympathetic view toward his subject that few writers can match, Krakauer manages to shed light on the motives of McCandless without either lionizing or vilifying the man for what he did.<br /><br />I thought Krakauer was very clear in his approach and in what he was trying to do - shed light on what seems a dark mystery to many people.  But a lot of reviewers feel the need to moralize; they cannot resist \\"taking sides\\" for or against  McCandless (or Jon Krakauer, for that matter) in some kind of assumed debate concerning the right or wrong, the sane or crazy, regarding Alex's final adventure.  And this is puzzling to me.  It's hardly a secret that we live in an age of widespread moral relativism.  To some of us it seems that nothing is commonly held as sacred any more.  Certainly the choice to divorce one's spouse is hardly frowned upon by society today.  But if a man can choose to divorce and remarry and even live a double life why is he forgiven while his (much less mature) son cannot be extended similar forgiveness for \\"divorcing\\" his parents because his \\"entire childhood seem[ed] like a fiction\\" due to the marital deception practiced by his parents?  The quotes are Chris McCandless's own words to his sister.  It seems to me we should try to forgive in both cases, but apparently many readers aren't willing to do that or likely don't even see the inequity here.  Or maybe some feel a need to slap a psychological diagnosis on McCandless or to otherwise conveniently categorize or label him lest we find we indeed have much in common with him; the practice of dividing into \\"us\\" and \\"them\\" camps has a certain way of conferring a sense of security.<br /><br />I find it rather easy to sympathize with McCandless without for one moment agreeing with what he did - but I never found reason to blame my parents for what I, too, often saw as a less-than-real world.  It seems to me that McCandless' rejection of society was just an extension of his inability to forgive his father, who, after all, represents the entirety of the world at large to a young impressionable male.  Of course that's throwing the baby out with the bathwater, but young people find it difficult to make such distinctions.  And really, so do a good many older adults - for example, how many of us vote Democrat or Republican not because we \\"believe\\" in the party platform but because we hate more what the Other Party stands for?  Is such an act not at core one of rebellion?<br /><br />Anyway, that's how I read Alex's character.  He refused thing like a decent map, adequate preparation, etc. because that was all part of the \\"fiction\\" of the world that belonged to the \\"fictional\\" existence embodied by his parents.  Maybe the abandoned bus appealed to him because it, like he, was an \\"outcast\\" from that world.  I think he might have felt the need to find just how little he could do with - because then he could be certain that such a basic need was \\"real\\" and not merely part of the \\"fiction\\" against which he was rebelling.  It's sad that he felt this way, if indeed he did, because such a person is just about impossible to reach.  But judging from my recollection of my own mindset of earlier years, I'd say there are many of us that, broadly speaking, either agree or at least sympathize with him now or at some time in our past.<br /><br />Although some reviewers have taken Krakauer to task for the insertion of his own story in the book, it certainly sheds much light on the person of Alex.  If we can wave off Chris McCandless without so much as a second thought, we certainly cannot do the same to Krakauer, if only because he has succeeded in the world in which McCandless/Alex could not get himself to fit.  I find especially illuminating Krakauer's statement that \\"The danger bathed the world in a halogen glow .....  [t]he world was made real\\" regarding his own climbing escapades.  Perhaps McCandless felt like that; one cannot be sure.  But there is surely something about going to extremes that turns one's perceptions up a notch or two.  Or perhaps the immediacy of living of his tramping life let Alex forget what he considered the \\"fiction\\" of his life.  However he saw it, it seems to me that this \\"fiction\\" was in some way in his mind connected to his references of \\"killing the false beast within\\" that he penned while staying on the bus.  And I think it's pretty clear that McCandless thought of his adventures as a way of trying to purge whatever it was that was gnawing at him.  Except for the extreme nature of his adventure, that's hardly foreign to more \\"normal\\" human experiences.  The practice of fasting and other forms of asceticism have a long tradition, and are often rooted in in the context of religious or other spiritual exercises.<br /><br />But the above is my own reading and opinion of the character of Chris/Alex; Krakauer didn't try to force his interpretation on the reader.  Kudos to him for writing in a way that avoids the temptation of excessive diagnostic reporting.  Kudos too for his efforts to make parallels with his own life.  I very much appreciate his references to his own struggles with his father while avoiding baring his soul more than necessary; he refers to \\"long-held family secrets\\" while sparing us the details.  Many another writer could not have resisted telling all; but Krakauer recognized that it was enough to make his point that whatever the secrets were, they affected him deeply and moved him to rage against his father, something that he held in common with Alex, something to which he assumed many of his readers could also relate that might make the main character in some way more accessible.<br /><br />For such a difficult subject matter, I can't see how any author could have done a better job.  Working with only the thinnest amount of source material, Krakauer managed to write a book that seems faithful to its subject.  Several reviewers have complained that the author's use of other examples, including his own, are mere \\"filler\\" to bring the book up to a minimum number of pages, but I don't see it that way at all - the side stories are absolutely essential to shed light on the central subject.  Besides, the narrative portion of the story would have been pretty dull anyway, because the book was hardly about whether Alex/Chris \\"made it\\" or how he otherwise might have, but rather about what internal dynamics drove him.  No matter how much material Chris left, any such an \\"objective\\" rendering of the story, which some seem to want, would never have amounted to shedding any light on the \\"why\\" of it all, which is of course exactly that for which such a story simply begs.<br /><br />I believe I'll give this book five stars, because I sincerely believe it could hardly have been done better - it is as close to perfect as possible.  Thank you, Mr. Krakauer.e he has succeeded in the world in which McCandless/Alex could not get himself to fit.  I find especially illuminating Krakauer's statement that \\"The danger bathed the world in a halogen glow .....  [t]he world was made real\\" regarding his own climbing escapades.  Perhaps McCandless felt like that; one cannot be sure.  But there is surely something about going to extremes that turns one's perceptions up a notch or two.  Or perhaps the immediacy of living of his tramping life let Alex forget what he considered the \\"fiction\\" of his life.  However he saw it, it seems to me that this \\"fiction\\" was in some way in his mind connected to his references of \\"killing the false beast within\\" that he penned while staying on the bus.  And I think it's pretty clear that McCandless thought of his adventures as a way of trying to purge whatever it was that was gnawing at him.  Except for the extreme nature of his adventure, that's hardly foreign to more \\"normal\\" human experiences.  The practice of fasting and other forms of asceticism have a long tradition, and are often rooted in in the context of religious or other spiritual exercises.<br /><br />But the above is my own reading and opinion of the character of Chris/Alex; Krakauer didn't try to force his interpretation on the reader.  Kudos to him for writing in a way that avoids the temptation of excessive diagnostic reporting.  Kudos too for his efforts to make parallels with his own life.  I very much appreciate his references to his own struggles with his father while avoiding baring his soul more than necessary; he refers to \\"long-held family secrets\\" while sparing us the details.  Many another writer could not have resisted telling all; but Krakauer recognized that it was enough to make his point that whatever the secrets were, they affected him deeply and moved him to rage against his father, something that he held in common with Alex, something to which he assumed many of his readers could also relate that might make the main character in some way more accessible.<br /><br />For such a difficult subject matter, I can't see how any author could have done a better job.  Working with only the thinnest amount of source material, Krakauer managed to write a book that seems faithful to its subject.  Several reviewers have complained that the author's use of other examples, including his own, are mere \\"filler\\" to bring the book up to a minimum number of pages, but I don't see it that way at all - the side stories are absolutely essential to shed light on the central subject.  Besides, the narrative portion of the story would have been pretty dull anyway, because the book was hardly about whether Alex/Chris \\"made it\\" or how he otherwise might have, but rather about what internal dynamics drove him.  No matter how much material Chris left, any such an \\"objective\\" rendering of the story, which some seem to want, would never have amounted to shedding any light on the \\"why\\" of it all, which is of course exactly that for which such a story simply begs.<br /><br />I believe I'll give this book five stars, because I sincerely believe it could hardly have been done better - it is as close to perfect as possible.  Thank you, Mr. Krakauer.
B0060ZJ7BC|1.0|Found this movie to be boring, I didn't realize it was all about baseball.  Brad Pitt staring in it was the only reason I bought it.  Must be more careful in the future.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|wonderful game that gets better with every level of games opened :) anyone can play and everyone will enjoy it!
B003Y5H5HO|3.0|A Hollywood remake of a Swedish movie made just two years ago, is the first part of the best selling trilogy Millennium, by the late Swedish author (and journalist) Stieg Larsson. The plot is mostly about how investigative journalist Michael Blomkvist (clearly an alter ego of Larsson) is asked by Henrik Vanger, an aging captain of industry to solve the murder of his favorite niece forty years ago. By some strange circumstances, he will be helped in the investigation by the pierced, troubled hacker Lisbeth Salander, with whom professional cooperation will soon turn into the personal as they discover the very dark secrets running under the very successful Vanger family. The Hollywood version is also set in Sweden, though here all the characters speak in English.<br /><br />As much as I like the original movie (I haven't read the books) I must admit that its view of the world is a bit naive, equivalent to an earnest teenager shouting that the whole world is corrupt. In the US version, Blomkvist is played by Daniel Craig (a fine actor who has made a career playing macho guys) as a stronger and more attractive man than in the Swedish movie (where he was played by the older and somewhat chubby Michael Nyqvist). On the other hand, the Lisbeth Salander character is played in the remake by Rooney Mara as a weaker woman than in the original (she might be a fine actress, but she doesn't show it here, despite critical acclaim for her performance). Noomi Rapace made a far stronger impression as Lisbeth in the Swedish movie.<br /><br />Though there are not major changes in the movie plot, the Hollywood version does make small variations, which I think are generally for the worse. For instance, when Craig tries to understand the meaning of certain numbers that might be a clue to the murder, his daughter, who is a fervent catholic going to a religious camp, alerts him that they are a biblical reference. This scene is unlikely, since there are very few Catholics in Sweden, or very religious people for that matter, as it is a very secular country. In the original version, the character of the daughter does not appear, and is Lisbeth, by surfing in the net, that finds the religious connections.<br /><br />The director is David Fincher. He has occasionally made fine movies (for instance, Zodiac) but most of the time his work tend to the flashy and empty (Seven, Fight Club), the overrated (The Social Network) if not to the directly mediocre (Benjamin Button). This movie is not totally worthless, but it is disappointing, and it is considerably weaker than the original version.

B003L77GRO|5.0|I have all the seasons of Dexter and this just adds to the collection.  Always get the best prices on Amazon and this was no exception.  For those who don't know of \\"Dexter\\" he is a serial killer by night and a blood spatter specialist for the Miami PD by day.  Twists and turns makes you wonder if and when he will ever be caught. Michael C. Hall is a great actor.  Loved him in Six Feet Under too.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It is insulting to compare the book \\"Fifty shades of Grey\\" to the Twilight saga, not only insulting to Stephanie Meyers, but also to all of us who loved Stephanie's books. Call me old fashioned, but this \\"fifty shades of porn\\" does not fit into the same class with Twilight. I managed to read through the first quarter of the first \\"F-Shades of Grey\\" book and get through the so called vanilla sex, but this domineering soft porn sounds more like a twisted man's fantasy than any normal woman's would ever be and there is no way I want to experience reading the S&M sex that is promised to follow later on. I believe Miss James has misjudged her target audience and needless to say I would NOT recommend this book. I deleted this from my Kindle and hope to never think of it again.
B007BDK3SS|3.0|Great graphics<br />Fun gameplay<br />Tilt controls don't work on tablet (Acer Iconia A500)<br />Game performance poor on Samsung Galaxy (Captivate)<br />Hopefully they fix at least the tilt controls soon.

B006ZT47O0|5.0|This is a solid album from a band that know what they want to sound like, and know how to make that sound.  This work picks up where their last left off, and since it is in that familiar style, a fan of the band will like it immediately.<br /><br />Some people seem to be concerned that there is too much growling in this music, but I believe that there is no more here than in Design Your Universe.  It was just the right amount for my taste.  Indeed, that is one thing that sets Epica apart in my mind from many other gothic and symphonic metal bands: they use the cookie monster voice to its best effect, and in the right quantities.  Here, it usually occurs as a foil to a particularly interesting guitar part or other instrumental complexity, or as a simple contrast to Simons' soaring voice.  It works very well.<br /><br />Epica are a symphonic metal band, and they take both words in that appellation seriously.  What I have always liked best about Epica, beyond Simons' voice, is the sophisticated instrumental treatments.  Those are present in abundance here.  While it is instantly enjoyable, there is enough attention to detail in this music that it will stay near the top of my listening rotation for quite some time.<br /><br />If you have never heard Epica but enjoy symphonic metal, then you should try this.  I think this is the archetype of the genre.  If you have enjoyed past work from Epica, then you should listen to this right now.  Now.
B000YMJA7I|5.0|Ii don't usually use the words \\"best i have ever heard\\". However, this time is totally different. I was amazed by the sound of Axl's voice, the sheer brilliance of the band, and just the overall effort to give as full and quality an album as anyone from Rolling Stones to Springsteen. GNR are such a respected band. I like the hardeness of Welcome to the Jungle, especially the intro. I also love the innovative sounds of Paradice City (my favorite), Sweet Child O' Mine, You could be mine. So rad. If your a heavy metal fan, dont buy it but if you love hard rock from the 80's this is a must have.

You cannot store your digital copy on any computer, you have to have an internet connection and an account to watch you digital movie, no internet, no movie and slow internet, no enjoyment.

B000089RV6|4.0|This is an amazing album! Back In Black (the song not album) actually really annoys the hell out of me, because I hear it so many times probably. Even with that, every song is awesome on this album. What I don't like is when people don't like AC/DC just because they hear the same songs over and over on the radio...you have to get into their other not-SO-popular music too to really get to like them sometimes. And this album, is definitely one of their best, not JUST because of the song Back In Black, but because of EVERY song on it.

It has a great deal of information on different ways to start and end rounds, how to read written patterns and charts, how to weave in ends and even help on choosing colors. There are hints on how to keep motifs flat, how to accentuate or minimize corners, and even many different ways to join. There is way more than I bargained for here. I'm so glad to have this book. I know I'll be using it a lot. The copy I purchased was also spiral bound. I highly recommend this so that while you're working the book can lay open flat.
B0052VUNHC|2.0|Innocent 19-year old girl falls for the campus tough who solves all his problems with violence. After the appropriate number of adolescent ups and downs they get married and seal the deal with tattoos. If rednecks had their own fairy tales, this would be their Beauty and the Beast.<br /><br />Like fairy tales, this story ends at Happily Ever After, leaving us free to imagine this couple's life after the glory years of college. Travis commits some horrific act of violence every five minutes, which in the real world would get him suspended if not incarcerated, but there are no adults around to notice. (There's a history teacher and a lunch lady; otherwise this is Lord of the Flies University, complete with underground fight clubs.) Abby is the only one who can soothe the savage beast, which is supposed to be romantic but reads like creepy codependency. (The one sane character, nice preppy Parker, actually points this out, to no avail.) Every time Abby goes running back to her sociopath boyfriend, your inner grown-up shakes her head and sighs. But after awhile, she's so awful to Parker that you end up hoping Travis gives her a black eye.<br /><br />This book isn't badly written, but I can't say I enjoyed it.

B006Y9BVRM|4.0|The good:<br />great looking, great lume, solar power-no battery changes, quartz accuracy, not too heavy on the wrist, smooth bezel operation<br />The not so good:<br />Strap is rather narrow for the size of the watch and the rubber is a little stiff for comfort, the screw down crowns for the chronograph don't always seem to tighten properly- they just seem too easy to unscrew to make me feel confident about water resistance though I haven't gotten it wet yet to check<br /><br />The rest of the story:<br />The watch has a separate dial with 24 hour marks on it but it can not be set independently-seems kinda pointless- there are easier ways to incorporate military time and that complication would have been great for tracking a second time zone. It probably could have been done by the factory with minimal added expense( I would have been happy to give another $20-$40 to get it ). The main second hand doesn't move unless you are in stopwatch mode. Seconds are tracked on one of the smal dials. Not really a bad thing just kinda weird<br /><br />This is my first chronograph so maybe these functions are normal but they do seem strange to me. Otherwise I like this watch quite a bit and I'm sure it will get lots of wear. No complaints with amazon. Watch arrived quickly and as described but note that seiko sells a few other \\"SSC\\" models in assorted color and bracelet configurations. All have the same movement. Some others are marked as\\"GMT\\" which I would take to mean able to track another time zone which it does not.
B004I744AS|4.0|well, this app is great 'n all, but really? it doesn't let you type in a definition of a word where you don't know THE word. Ya know? well, other than that tidbit, this a good free app. This one is one of the few higher end free ape there is.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Fifty Shades will be loved by any woman who loved Twilight.  No character development, the girl keeps making the same mistakes over and over again and never learns, and for an unknown reason the male character is willing to change his whole life and who he is to win her over.<br />It is never going to will a Pulitzer, but if you need a book for the beach it is perfect.
B003Z4JQM6|5.0|These sandals never left my feet during a trip to Maui.  Used them everywhere from walking the storefronts in Lahaina, to walking in the surf, to hiking up to Waimoku falls in a muddy downpour- every situation they performed excellently.  Being such an enclosed sandal, don't expect them to be as airy as a conventional sandal, but they are a good compromise between foot support, water sport and foot comfort.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|Yes, there are bloodier, gorier movies out there. But there is nothing that will tear your heart up like this movie. It is disturbing on a level that perhaps a handfull of movies ever made have reached. It is an unforgettable horror masterpiece like no other.
0545128285|5.0|I love this book so much!!! It's fun, entertaining, and just all-together Harry Potter perfect! I love how Rowling includes the commentary by Albus Dumbledore. Definitely a book I will read to my kids someday!!!
0439023513|2.0|First off, let start by saying that LOVED book one and two. I couldn't put them down and was so pumped to read the third. I wish I hadn't. I wish I would have stopped at number two and made up my own ending in my head. What was Collins thinking? Using the podium she created for herself to spout of anti-war agendas? To say that all the world is hopeless? That most people are despicable human beings? We get it-- War is Hell, but is there no hope left in the world? No hope left in regaining any joy or redemption?<br /><br />I think it was almost terrible to gear up your readers with the love triangle plot only to spend-- at the most-- a couple of paragraphs to the pathetic, unemotional ending of who Katniss ends up with. (Collins gives more emotional insight to Katniss reuniting with the cat then with Peeta. Ridiculous) And how Katniss whole \\"I will kill Snow\\" plot to bring down the capital never really happens. These two plots were essential in book one and two and everyone was gearing up to their epic conclusions in book three, only to be left unfulfilled and feeling miserable and terribly cheated. What a waste.<br /><br />This book was not about Katniss, Peeta, Gale, the Hunger Games or anything or anybody else you have grown attached to. It is about Suzanne Collins and her views and opinions about war.<br /><br />Save yourself the aggravation, read these next SPOILER sentences and I promise it will be more fulfilling than reading the book.<br /><br />************SPOILERS************<br /><br />--The Capitol falls because of the rebel invasion from District 13.<br />--President Coin was just as corrupt as President Snow, so Katniss assassinates Coin at the end instead of Snow. Snow dies from choking on his own blood or a stampede. We don't know.<br />--Prim dies. Finnick dies. Annie has a baby.<br />--Katniss' mom ends up being a nurse in another district.<br />--Gale gets a fancy job in District 2 and leaves Katniss behind with no reason of why. But Katniss thinkshe is busy kissing other girls in his new district.<br />--Katniss is released from custody after assassinating Coin for being mental insane. She is barricaded to her home in District 12. Which is being rebuilt or salvaged.<br />--Peeta joins her in District 12. They are both physically burned and mentally unstable. They have a boy and a girl.<br />--Katniss ends up with Buttercup. (the only part in the whole book that will tug on your heartstrings)<br /><br />I gave the book two stars on the basis that Peeta and Katniss ended up together. At least that was consistent and somewhat satisfying.

B0051HNMTI|5.0|For a five minute workout this app rocks! You get to chose your routine or have the app pick a random one for you. It gives you time to change positions and rest and it has a tutorial to show you and tell you how to do each exercise. It also works great on the Kindle Fire.

B006P0FICE|4.0|I have seen all of the three musketeers movies out there.  I read the book when I was 9 years old and I have been a fan ever since.  I enjoyed watching this movie.  The airship is a little far fetched but so what.  I was thoroughly entertained.  I saw the movie in 3D when it first came out.  Actually, I was so excited about it when I talked to the movie employees that the manager from the theatre gave me the musketeer poster.<br /><br />The movie was filmed in Germany - in and around Munich and other Southern German towns, at several different estates and at the King Ludwig II castle on the Mens' Island (Herreninsel).  There are no cars allowed on this island.  This castle is an exact copy of Versailles.  The film makers probably could not get permission to film in Versailles.  King Ludwig of Bavaria was a huge fan of the Sun King, Louis 16th and he dedicated several rooms to him which are inside this castle.  Almost every year I visit the castle there and take a round trip by boat with my family.  Even if you don't like the movie all that much, than at least enjoy the scenery.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I'm in love with this app. I have it on my aneroid phone, my kindle fire, and my macbook. its incredible and easy to use. I can literally save any kind of file, picture, url, note, ANYTHING. And I can view it anywhere I go! its helped me a lot with getting things more organized. much better than a simple note keeper.
B005E7AOHI|5.0|I admit I am biased as a long time fan,Its more brilliant music from one of the best Bass players and writers in the world,Lar is great on the guitar,Very underrated he is..\But then again Primus has always been! Buy it and play it,you will love it or hate it!

B006MQRLSA|5.0|Great movie and done very well and good feed to Roku, would watch again for the fun and emjoyment- That's ALL
0446573019|3.0|Intelligently written and fast-moving, Zero Day provides exactly the entertainment value that Baldacci intended. In the end, close the cover and move on to the next book. This is a franchise writer with good ideas who tells a tale without getting bogged down in exposition, taking the time to give his characters some depth, and bringing his outline home in time to meet his publisher's deadline. In short, a smart and professional book, written with more intellect than heart.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Love this completely  I had to buy the whole series ,it was so worth it. would also recommend Gods of the arena
B005G4TJI4|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE THE PERSON WHO I BOUGHT IT FOR JUST LOVED IT LIKE I SAID THE PERSON I BOUGHT THE TRANSFOMERS:DARK SIDE OF THE MOON IT IS BY FAR THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE THE MOVIE  WAS 2DISC BLUE RAY /DVD COMBO + DIGITAL COPY GENE
B002RVCD6O|5.0|Needed this movie to complete my collection, Amazon was the most resonable.  Have VCR tape, but wanted DVD. Grandkids got me hooked on Harry Potter.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|All the teenagers in the family had read this and loved it so I thought I would see what it was all about.  This book certainly has a fast moving storyline and I enjoyed it so much I had to get the final two books of this series
B0070Z4M4I|2.0|Not very good.  Kind of boring. Just a rehash of previous makes of The Thing. The Kurt Russell version is the best!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|cool game but the games cost a lot and are sometimes hard to earn. if they lowered their price maybe it would be more efficient.
B004ZJZPWA|5.0|I purchased this disc to replace my DVD version. The upconverted DVD (via my Oppo BDP-93) is not as detailed as the Blu-ray version. In addition, the high-def sound has more impact than the DVD version. The picture detail, especially in the dark scenes is outstanding.
0307887960|5.0|Easy to buy, fast postage, great book, im 2 weeks into the diet and i have lost 9kg, so im very very pleased with the book,its a great read and a great way to lose that unwanted weigth.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I got this book because Robin Roberts on GMA mentioned this book and referred to it as \\"erotic\\" and they went on to report about how women everywhere were all hot and bothered about this book.  I am a sucker for steamy romance novels and thought, \\"hey, if Robin likes it...\\"<br /><br />Oh my goodness I should have read the reviews here, for I had no idea this involved S&M.  That is NOT my thing.<br /><br />I agree with one reviewer here about the way the story is narrated.  It is to \\"mechanical\\" at times. But, all in all the story IS good so far (I am still reading it) and I am still glued to this book, intrigued by what might be coming next.<br /><br />Anastasia is sweet, innocent and daring, Christian is dark, lost and HOT. Theirs is a love story and worth reading it.
B00005JLEU|5.0|In my opinion,this is still Miyazaki's best work.No matter if you are all grown up or still a child, this film will enchant you.If your a fan like me,you might find this interesting.[[ASIN:B004T3FODW Exploring Miyazaki's Spirited Away]]
B000W7JWUA|5.0|At first I thought it would be a really nerdy game because my boyfriend is a huge nerd. I refused to play it for the longest time. But he begged so much that I broke down and played. It is the best game ever! It is so much fun and it makes people who love it really competitive. We played it everyday for multiple hours of spring break and then got the expansion pack for 5-6 players, which is fast-paced and so much fun!
B004ZISVWC|3.0|Kudos to the crew that made this film for utilizing the \\"Blair Witch\\" hand-held cam technique without the nausea-inducing jostling. I like the idea of exploring Scandinavian myth through a monster movie, but I've got to say that in this case, the monsters just aren't that scary. The trolls, when you see them, are more like giant muppets than terrifying creatures of legend. From what I've read, it seems that the film is very true to its source, citing different tribes of trolls and the various herbs and natural phenomenon that repel them. However, despite being well-researched and earnest, large swaths of the film come off as simply campy. If you are the sort of person who is charmed by campy monster movies, or fascinated by authentic (i.e. gory and spooky) fairy tales, this is a film for you. If you want to be scared, look elsewhere.
B004S699HC|1.0|This is one Blu-ray disc I should not have purchased. There is no improvement in picture/sound quality and the story line is not as good as the original.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Such a fun and entertaining read.  Bourdain makes you feel like you have a true glimpse of what happens behind the scenes!
B0071CBBKS|3.0|Scars & Stories is probably my least favorite of The Fray's albums. But it's still good enough to listen to. My biggest complaint is the mixing, all I hear through most every song is snare drum. Apart from that, there are some really good songs (Heartbeat, Run for Your Life, Be Still), and there are some really bad songs (Turn Me On is one of my leave favorite songs ever), and everything else is somewhere in between.
B005FITIK0|5.0|Mavis Gary is a mess.  She is permanently sixteen.  She drinks herself to sleep while watching the Kardashian empire grow and she walks around oblivious to her own obscurity by convincing herself that she's somehow important.  She escaped small down life by moving to the Mini-Apple and she's never looked back once.  She writes a `dead in the water' YA series that is rounding the corner of completion and she thinks anything that isn't manufactured by media propaganda is `gross'.  She leans on her own crutch, a crutch created by a self-loathing she won't confront and enabled by those who loath themselves and will admit it (the little people are obsessed with her).  Like I said, she's a mess.<br /><br />In `Young Adult', former stripper and Oscar winner Diablo Cody crafts a sharply focused dissection of a woman who refused to grow up and who insists that she's above everyone else.<br /><br />`Young Adult' is a simple prose.  Mavis finds out that her high school sweetheart has become a new father just as she is being hit with her deadline for her final book.  Suffering from severe writer's block she heads to her home town to see the new baby and hopefully steal her ex back from his wife.  In the process she reconnects with an equally lost soul who becomes a voice of reason to the misguided Mavis.<br /><br />If only she'd listen.<br /><br />There is no fat here.  This film is sharp and to the point and just `gets it'.  Charlize is hilarious yet with a purpose.  You can see the dramatic weight of her past life haunting her current motives.  She nails this performance; possibly the best of her career.  Comedian Patton Oswalt is also flawless here.  The way that he embodies his character, Matt, with the right amount of self-pity is brilliantly colored.  He's believable; sad and lonely yet seemingly stable.  Yet again, Patrick Wilson is nothing more than a pretty prop (does NO ONE IN HOLLYWOOD RESPECT HIS OBVIOUS TALENT?????) but it doesn't fault the film since he needed to be that in order for this to work.<br /><br />Great film, great central performances; I'm ashamed that the Academy didn't bite!be that in order for this to work.<br /><br />Great film, great central performances; I'm ashamed that the Academy didn't bite!

B0050BPIB0|5.0|I bought this CD from Amazon because in my country I couldn't find it....Pablo is just an excelent artist his voice has made me fall in love with him in each song...you should buy a copy of this CD  because I'm pretty sure his career will last lots of time!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game for laid-back casual fun. It kind of reminds me of Unblock Me with more obstacles. Well worth the money!
B004QMYKSG|5.0|This is such a wonderfully fun CD. I was thoroughly surprised at how much I loved it, but it's easily one of my favorite albums of 2011.
B0013D8LOK|3.0|There are some major plusses to Tim Burton's `Sweeney Todd', and then there are some major lulls.  Balancing out the two in the attempt to write a well-rounded and non-bias review is difficult.  One leans towards a particular viewpoint.  You either dwell on the lows or you dwell on the highs.<br /><br />Considering my current estimation of both Depp's and Burton's worth, I tend to focus on those lows.<br /><br />`Sweeney Todd' tells the story of a barber, envied for his lovely wife by a corrupt judge.  That judge trumps up a false charge against the barber and has him locked away so that he can advance upon his wife.  Years later, this barber is back in London seeking revenge under a new name, Sweeney Todd.  With the help of a downtrodden baker (who's pies are the worst around), Todd sets up his shop of massacre, targeting the men responsible for his emotional demise and the apparent suicide of his wife.  His plans are desperate, especially when he hears of plans made by the judge to marry the daughter bore to Todd before his imprisonment.<br /><br />The construction of this musical is VERY good.  I love the way that Burton was able to capture the real decadence of the stage while maintaining his signature style of whimsical macabre.  The darkness envelopes each scene in a way that defies current perception of `the musical'.  I loved the way that this felt to stage-like; like I was really in the Opera House.  It is such a richly textured film.  The costumes, the set pieces; they are flawless.<br /><br />That said; the film is flawed.<br /><br />The main batch of performances are lackluster, with one exception (Alan Rickman).  The two leads (Depp and Bonham Carter) are horrible singers who drag down their scenes with lackluster vocals.  The internal flow of the film is stilted in moments (parts truly drag themselves out) and the young star-crossed lovers are terrible acts, despite being marginally better singers than the leads.  Oh, and I loathe that Sacha Baron Cohen has been reduced to a flamboyant `accent' in every film he's in now.  I mean, he's so much more than that!  Sadly, the musical itself is a hard one to sing with conviction and emotional relevance.  The hooks are tricky and don't swell in areas that are enveloping like more recognizable musicals.  Because of that, the lack of vocal ability really takes center stage here.<br /><br />At least that little boy can sing his butt off.<br /><br />See this for the goth/sheek fashions and Alan Rickman's brilliantly crafted performance (so subtle yet invested in his sincere `evil').n has been reduced to a flamboyant `accent' in every film he's in now.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I read this book last November/December on my iPhone, and despite the massive migraine I got from staring at the little backlit screen for a few hours every day, I couldn't stop.  The book was the most amazing I've read - EVER.  I haven't read any of King's other work (though I just downloaded It) and I was/am still so happy this was my first.  I'm now reading it for a 2nd time on my Kindle (christmas gift) and I can't put it down, even though I know what's going to happen!  The story is so rich and I find myself feeling, when I finally put it down, like I'm in that weird between sleep and awake place where everything is fuzzy and I'm confused as to who I am and whether I'm reading or dreaming or living the story myself.  I know I'll laugh and cry and bite my lip in anticipation again - actually I already have been - and I'm looking forward to it.  I don't think this story could ever get old to me!  I heard a rumor about a movie and I hope they do make it into a miniseries a la The Stand!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Hunger Games was recommended to me by Kindle Shop after I purchased the Girl with the Dragon Tatoo series.  Well thanks to that I completed that trilogy and thoroughly enjoyed each one. I had never really touched on futuristic fiction but after reading this series am open to more. Suzanne Collins is a masterful story teller!
B004EPYZPS|5.0|Super 8 is a really fun and exciting movie to watch.  Probably what sells the movie so well is the incredible acting by the kids in the movie.  The girl in the movie did such a great job as well as the boy, so the movie just sucks you in. I give it a thumbs up and is really worth a watch. Oh, it is a Sci-Fi movie so just know it is a little bit of a monster movie.<br />Check it out.
B000TERLEK|4.0|This is where I believe that Coldplay kind of decided who they were, musically.  It is a really good album, with some of their best songs.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|so far, this has been an inexpensive way to pass time; this is a solitaire game, which I did not realize when I first downloaded.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love it<br />great game gets hard to un lock games eventually tho.takes. allot of money<br />but fun to play none the less
B002H3F7F6|1.0|I couldn't even get through sampling the tracks. What is that affected, unnatural vocal style he is employing? It's embarrassing. It sounds like a bad parody of a schlocky lounge singer. I'm guessing he's trying to compensate for the raspy-ness of his aging vocal chords. Sting has always sounded best, and often spectacular, in higher ranges. Please stick with what you're good at, Sting.  I must confess I haven't listened to anything he's done after \\"Ten Summoners Tales\\" - I still regard his first four LPs as timeless classics and still listen to them regularly. Just an added note: Sting's transformation from a quasi-punk rebel in the late '70s to polished rock star in the '80s to masterful, penetrating lyricist and composer in the late '80s/early '90s was a thing of beauty to behold.  He is now an uber-rich, upper crust English Country Gentleman more preoccupied with fine wines and lustrous lifestyle than much else. We'll always have his exquisite early work, thankfully. \\"If On A Winter's Night\\" reminds me of a 50-year old former heavyweight champion coming out of retirement for a final bout from which he emerges battered and deflated.

B006O5XYWG|3.0|Computer animation is still not up to doing believable humanoid characters--not even chimps.  The monkey Caesar suffers from the crucible of problems virtually every CGI character in movies suffers from: he overacts (constant rubber-face), he's over-rendered, and he moves way too fast.<br /><br />If these were technical limitations, it'd be one thing.  But they're not. They're the result of show-offy decisions. The apes are especially unconvincing when clothed.  All in all, Roddy McDowell in a mask was more convincing.  At least he could act.<br /><br />And while we're on that subject, James Franco is cast here playing...a brilliant scientist.  The poor kid can't read a line without sounding like a whiny, lisping teenager. Good sound design.
B006UKC566|5.0|I don't understand why people dislike this movie so much. I loved it, but then again I did not go to the theaters to see a deep emotional or psychological movie portrayed by Shakespearian actors . I simply went to see a take on Greek mythology that is a  great action flick with some fantastic graphics, and that is exactly what I got. Highly recommended! Ignore anyone telling you otherwise.
B00004ST9Q|1.0|I am very dissatisfied, I could not get this CD to play on any player in my home.<br />It appears to me that this CD was burnt. I'm sure this seller made a one time killing  on this product, however. I would never do business with this person again.

I feel like I'm going to puke right now, I just finished the book about a minute ago. Third book, please come out faster... </3<br />Anyways, this book was a LOT different from the first book. I'd say the first one was better but this book was still very good.
1594488843|4.0|Coming to this topic with no background in psychology, I greatly enjoyed Daniel Pink's book on the key motivating factors in how people make decisions. He makes a compelling argument for his case which basically shows that people are motivated by being given more control, being allowed to get better at what they do, while feeling that they are working on something bigger that has permanent purpose.<br /><br />The last part of the book is a toolkit for individuals and companies, showing how of these ideas can be put into effect in the real world. In many respects this was the most useful part of the book, since after being convinced by the first section the reader is otherwise left with questions about how to implement these ideas. By the way, for a summary of the main topics, Daniel Pink gave an excellent TED presentation that's well worth viewing on their website.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|In a nutshell this DVD  is even better than Eagles \\"Hel freezes over\\"  the quality of audio and visual both are of exceptionally high standard. The song selection by the group is also extremely good, with two DVD's in the pack no doubt offers real good value for money.  Anyone who wishes to buy this should not have any doubts and will never ever regret for buying it.

B006LEHOL2|5.0|This album is simply stunning. I've been cynical of Sinead O'Connor for years, but not any more.<br />The song \\"Back Where You Belong\\" is a beautifully crafted tour de force which speaks volumes of the times we live in.<br />Thanks Sinead, you're a gem!
B007BDK3SS|2.0|This game is a total let down from trialx the first game. Buttons are small, tilt doesnt work. Gameplay is awful. Looks decent and there are starting line chicks +1 star

0385121679|5.0|Wonderfully constructed psychological analysis of a descent into madness with a little help from 'the other side'!<br />Stephen King said,when asked about the Stanley Kubrick adaptation of his book,it was one I \\"...remember hating\\". Read this book and you will realize that Stephen was being overly kind! The movie was an absolute travesty and totally miscast.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game because I like all of the games on it because I had all of those games on my DS.

B004LWZW8S|3.0|This movie does not live up to the hype. Since when can a god be killed? How exactly does that work? The unrealism was too much and did not match the level of violence. The premise was good, but awful execution.
B004E3VLZW|5.0|sure its very expensive but this remastered shm-cd offers far better audio quality compared to the previous cd. I'm glad the amazing tracks on this album finally got the treatment it needed for customers to enjoy.
B005CMSDLE|5.0|Hanna is a young girl raised by her ex-CIA father to be almost a wolf-child.  They live in the snowy wastes of Finland, she kills reindeer with an arrow, she learns Ninja moves and multiple languages.<br /><br />She is a survivalist in the forest and also in civilization.<br /><br />At her own request, she is rudely transported to \\"civilization\\"--the deserts of Morocco, underground prisons, the dregs of Berlin, all to kill a woman who has killed her mother and who will kill her if she can (played by Cate Blanchett).<br /><br />Her father, meanwhile, goes on the same quest separately.<br /><br />The real heart of the movie, however, is Hanna's process of becoming human.  She learns, awkwardly and painfully, to let some other people into her life (a roving family of hippies).<br /><br />All of this is plausible and even beautiful.<br /><br />Saoirse Ronan is wonderful as Hanna.  She can switch from innocent to terrifying in a moment, yet always retains her fey ethereality.  Eric Bana is also good.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett is good in the role, but, amazingly, has an atrocious accent.  Blanchett is one of the best actors in the world, and her accents are usually perfect (see \\"Aviator\\"), but here the accent is awful.  She is trying for Southern U.S., but it slides around and clanks and never really hits it.<br /><br />But that's a small defect.<br /><br />The not-so-subtle subtext of the movie is: Big Brother is evil, no matter which country he is from.  The CIA is hardly different from the Gestapo.  Hanna, of course, is an experiment, and her pale Nordic looks push home the point.
0307352145|1.0|I came across the ad for this book while riding the train and it got me intrigued. For a large part I do consider myself to be an introvert so it was natural for me to reach for this book. After going through the last page I reflected on its content and sadly I was left in a grey, mixed-feeling kind of zone. Somehow, I am not sure the author did full justice to the topic she intended to cover.<br /><br />The start was great when the author lists the `successful' introverts. Her message was to embrace it and make the best of your being an introvert - that you can be successful even if you are not the outgoing kind. All well and good.<br /><br />Then she moves to the physiological part and quotes from a lot of studies and data. This bogged me down quite a bit. I felt it was good to know why we are what we are from a scientific point of view but after a point I found the studies and data pages to be overwhelming. The author seemed to underline her point that  if you are an introvert, data overwhelmingly says you are what you are and can simply not avoid being what you are - an introvert.<br /><br />Then the author moves onto compare Asian children to America children and delves on their approach to education and life in general. Asian kids are found to be the introverted kind whereas the Americans more outgoing. I am not sure whether I agree with this. I found the author stepping (or confusing herself) from cultural to introvert a little too conveniently. What she deems as being introvert I would label it more of a cultural issue where a people and society \\"consciously\\" place a large amount of emphasis to excel in the field of education whereas in the American/Western approach we are  more holistic stressing on the overall development of the child therefore the exposure to sports, arts and extra-curricular activities in general that can appear extroverted.<br /><br />I also took exception to the Asian and American proverbs used in order to compare introverts and extroverts. The author misses the point that the Asian proverbs have a foundation of deep \\"conscious\\" cultural and philosophical thought behind them. It is a mark of a culture and the \\"choice\\" of a people to the dedication of deep thought and spiritual curiosity not a state of being an introvert. If the author had delved a little more deeply in Asian/Indian studies she would have found that emphasis of education is not restricted to the introverted types but as a foundation for all (community, society) to excel in life. Though the idea of a \\"good education = good job\\" is largely western and the driving force in today's world, for generations Asians and Indians pursued knowledge for a whole lot more than its pragmatic offerings.<br /><br />In continuation of the above thought I wish the author would have researched on the aim and benefits of Yoga and compared them to introverts. It would provide an interesting topic of research.  If I like practicing Yoga, to acquire a state of calm and balance in life, a life totally calm and focused inward, does that make me an introvert? It has been proven that yoga for a large part changes a person's physiological and psychological state from an active person (extrovert) to somebody calmer (introvert?). How does this compare to the physiological state of an introvert?<br /><br />Dedicating a chapter to the Recession of 2008 was a little too tacky for me. To blame extroverted people as a cause for the Great Recession, Enron etc seemed too simplistic. At what point does moral accountability, responsible leadership or a sense of empathy come in the picture? To say that if introverts were in charge of the economy that things would be different is a little stretched for me. One counter point that comes to mind is, who devised the intricate products, ABCP, Risky derivatives? I doubt it was an extrovert.<br /><br />I was not too comfortable on the advice to introverts to pretend to be extroverts because successful introverts have done them. Without weighing in on the moral implications I found it too easy of an advice and generally self-defeating. Somehow it sent the message you really cannot make a living being an introvert.<br /><br />Lastly, I wish the book would have a chapter on the deeper problems that introverts face - depression, doubt etc. The book highlights on mostly the outward aspect - public speaking, being more aggressive in communicating etc but being an introvert, living in one's own world has its own set of demons. How does an introvert fight the self-doubts regardless of outward situations. How does an introvert cope with the struggle to act or not to act? Do introverts get more depressed than extroverts? I wish the author would not have been `Quiet' on these issues?<br /><br />I seriously think the book could be far more deep than in its current version. The inner world is a mystery that only now has seriously begun piquing peoples' interest. A lot needs to be done and explored. Personally, I would have me think as an introvert but there are people who laugh at me when I say that. I justify that comment as I have found myself shut in a room for hours on end working quietly on a project but at the same time I can totally unwind and be part of the sales group at the local bar. I spend time writing, thinking deeply and am naturally attracted to topics considered deep but yet I have little problem connecting with people on mundane issues. I would conclude that one side does not fit all. And to reiterate if the author ever wants to write a sequel I would advise her to study Eastern Philosophy. A lot of insights can be gained on the evolution of human consciousness in its various states. She would see that Introversion = Eastern and Extroversion = Western would have a totally different meaning.
B007BDK3SS|1.0|I loved the first Trial Xtreme, and have played a few levels of the Trial Xtreme 2 Winter edition on my Xoom, but this version does not work.  The tilt controls are not recognized, so the only way to control is with the onscreen buttons, which is not effective on a tablet.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll change my review once it's repaired, but for now the game is unplayable.
0515123447|4.0|I haven't finished the book, but I like the hero (I'm learning a lot about how to end a fight quickly and really hurt somebody) and the plot moves ahead, though in fits and starts.  Way too much talk about what they had for breakfast.<br /><br />I am SO glad that others noticed the truly annoying repetition of the word \\"shrugged.\\"  This is simply careless editing. There are many ways a writer can express confusion or bewilderment.  I thought the profusion of shrugs was obvious to me because I'm a linguist, but others noticed it too.  It is bad enough to be a distraction, so now I'm counting the shrugs (20 in one 100-page excerpt) as I follow the plot.  I blame his editor, David Highfill, for a truly amateurish oversight.

0385523912|5.0|By interviewing North Korean defectors and focusing on a few who have settled in South Korea, Demick has managed to give readers a look into one of the world's most totalitarian and secretive regimes. She does this by retracing the stories of six defectors, reconstructing their journeys through extensive interviews and substantiating their claims with original reporting and research. The result is an engaging, immensely readable work that lays bare the horrors of the North Korean regime.<br /><br />In the end, Demick's work makes you realize that North Koreans, despite having been brainwashed by their government all their lives, are a very intelligent and resilient people. More likely than not, they no longer believe the propaganda forced on them. Those gutsy enough to escape are doing so, and the rest are simply waiting around for the day when the regime collapses -- hoping they'll survive until then.<br /><br />Highly recommended for those curious about the last Communist dictatorship on earth.

1451648537|5.0|Great read, full of interesting little known facts about this genius mogul.  A book that will certainly be shared with friends.
0465011047|4.0|Kang Chol-hwan has written a gripping account of his ten years imprisoned in a North Korean labor camp, much of that while he was just a child. The details he provides give a glimpse into both the horrors of the regime and the depths of unimaginable suffering that humans are capable of inflicting upon one another, especially in a system where those being tortured are viewed as little more than cockroaches. What's most shocking is that within 150 years of socialism's conception its principles have been perverted into yet another means of justifying oppression against people who are perceived as being \\"different\\".<br /><br />Although a strong narrative overall, I had some concerns with the book. One is that, as translated from the French, the prose can seem somewhat stilted and awkward. Some vocabulary errors seem to also have escaped the proofreader's eye; for example, in English, taking attendance is \\"roll call\\", not \\"role call\\". \\"Role call\\" would make no sense, because the attendance register is the \\"roll\\". Secondly, because the account is a first-person narrative, told to French journalist Pierre Rigoulot, the book sometimes lacks the detail and rigor that would come from research & reporting. As such, Demick's [[ASIN:0385523912 Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea]] is a much richer account of life inside North Korea, although, of course, she could have nothing to say about the inner workings of a prison camp. The lack of detail is also hampered by the fact that Kang was very young when first confined to the camp, and who among us remembers specific details about our lives as nine-year-olds?<br /><br />Overall, I'm hesitant to recommend this book, unless you are very interested at the specific conditions inside a North Korean labor camp.
0743408187|5.0|The cover of my book looks different.<br />I would recommend to anyone interested in reading this book that they do a bit of research. There is only one edition that I know of which is approved by the Murphy foundation.<br />The way in which I came to learn about Dr. Murphy and this book is an amazing example of fate at work.<br />I love this book and I keep re-reading it and have even underlined key passages.<br />This book has had a profound impact on my life and on my person.<br />It is very important that one read this with a truly open mind.<br />Only then can it have a positive impact.<br />Any person who comes at this with a negative mindset will only walk away with that same negative mindset.<br />It all begins within.<br />I wish that all who will benefit from this book shall find it.<br />;)
0765326353|5.0|Sanderson's writing excels at creativity.  The world is well thought out, the cultures, the weather, fauna, flora, religions, etc.<br /><br />The dialogues are good.  The plot is amble paced and builds up towards the end.  You never lose interest because his writing style is the epitome of clarity.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson also is good at character development.  One character knows how to lead men and build their support.  And the deliberate plot shows you in detail how he does this, there is no skipping, with the very real setbacks and doubt that real people have despite being overall successful.  Rarely is this done with such minutiae that you feel you are being trained in how to do this yourself.  That said, he hasn't the command of 3D characters that some writers have.  His character's dialogue is neither over-long nor inconsistent or true to human realness.  It's just good enough.  This is about the only area I can imagine this author working on to still perfect.<br /><br />Sanderson has been compared to R.R. Martin.  Martin's world is more known.  Think Medieval with Dragons and Zombies.  Cool, right?  Martin is a modern cable TV writer:  Raw sex, raw death, intrigue that blurs the moral lines between good and bad, and doesn't hesitate to kill your favorite character.  However, Martin's Septology is something you might not want your 10 year old reading.<br /><br />Sanderson is more like Tolkien in his PG rating.  You could read his book to a Church group and not be worried.  His writing is more Classical.  This is creative Sci Fi Fantasy rendered with such clarity it's like a cool glass of water on a hot day.  He has turned the Sea onto the Land, but with so much thought out history and just enough complexity to not be overwhelming, but be credible.  His world creation is number one.  Tolkien took from myths.  Martin from history and myths.  But Sanderson seems to forego borrowing and create his own myths, own landscape, own cultures.  Perhaps there is some montage, but it's interrelated nature is something you have never imagined before, but immediately understand due to his ability to clearly describe.<br /><br />One thing that I really liked was how related every part of the book is.  Every quote has an ultimate context that isn't known to you for most of the book.  Thoroughly thought out, none of it is \\"filler\\" to waste space, but is part of the world and what is to come and what has already been.<br /><br />Having read his other books, this is an Author you can, like Martin, depend on for future quality.  I look forward to his other 9 books of this Hubbard-like Dekology!e montage, but it's interrelated nature is something you have never imagined before, but immediately understand due to his ability to clearly describe.<br /><br />One thing that I really liked was how related every part of the book is.

B002VHI8T0|3.0|I really enjoyed this book as I read it, there were scenes that we're so emotive for many reasons and I really felt for the author.. HOWEVER, on finishing the book, I looked up James Fray and it turns out the story was a lie, he made the entire story up..<br />On face value, it is a good read; but I felt cheated out of the reality I expected it to be..

B000002AT6|1.0|This sound track is horrible. The same repetitive theme over and over again. I want to hear music, but Horner uses over the top, special affects instead of  musical creativity, so that the listener will think that it's so new, dramatic, meaningful. Are you kidding me? Music for the dumb! The sound track is as bad as the soap opera, weakly developed movie. I will give this CD away to a friend who loves the film!
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Saw it in a theater, and had heard all the news stories about bad line delivery and bad acting, and on and on.<br /><br />Having worked with professional men like this in the past, from various branches, all I saw was real men talking like men talk.  I didn't see stuttering or off character delivery of lines, etc.  So, I have no idea what bet wetters were so concerned about the dialogue. I think some people in Hollywood, or somewhere, must have been concerned about the idea that actors weren't necessary, and in fact, would have made it not so great a picture. (IMHO) It was good to see the real deal, and see them get some credit for what they do, while we sleep peacefully in our beds at night.<br /><br />As for other critics who said it was a video game, well, you just have no clue.  Where do you think FPS video games get their ideas from, watching reruns of Gilligan's Island?  They get it from someone, somewhere who had it going on.  So, pardon me if it looked like a video game to you, but it looked like what SEALs do, and in some cases, what other elite forces do. If its a video game to you, so be it.<br /><br />I was proud to see the real men doing the job, even though the plot was fictional, it was cool to know these men really do stuff like this, so it was a good movie all around.  I'd like to see more like this!<br /><br />The ending, I thought the transition from the end into the credits was a good move back to reality, painful, but good.<br /><br />'Nuff said.<br /><br />BZ guys!
B0038BBA4I|4.0|Mumford is one of those bands that takes more than one listen to really understand and enjoy. The more you listen the more you will like them. I'm not a huge fan of every song they have but there are some really solid gems on this album. I love the imperfections and cracks in the lead vocalists voice as well as the sincerity that shines through. He has one of those voices that makes you feel and believe every word. The instrumentation is top notch. I remember watching their Grammy performance last year and being pretty floored with how amazing they sounded. The passion was palpable. You really can't go wrong with this album.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I made the mistake of buying Book 1 of the \\"Wool\\" series first. What I should have done is just bought the entire \\"omnibus\\" series right off the bat. WOW! What a great story this is. Very unique concept and best of all -- it involves NO vampires or werewolves or witches, which are all the rage these days. (I've had it up to *here* with vampires, werewolves and witches. Blech.)<br /><br />So do yourself a favor and just buy the entire set. You won't regret it! And you'll save some money. My only regret is that I gobbled up these stories like a hungry stray dog and now... I got nothin'. (Boo.) I hope there are more books to come in this series!
B005MMY534|5.0|This was a great series!  I was quite disappointed  to find that after watching the first season that they did not make a second season.  It was very well done, acting was great and the the casting was great.  It sure left me wanting more, again I was very disappointed to find out that I was not going to see a second season.

B004EPZ0AC|5.0|To all those writing false negative reviews (yes, all 250+ one-star reviews here are fake, orchestrated by a conspiracy blogger named Mike Mozart), get your facts straight. The film was not produced by the MPAA or Warner. It's an Australian production that happens to be distributed by Warner. If you want to slam the MPAA, please do so elsewhere. Don't slam an otherwise highly enjoyable kids flick that, ironically enough, is about the balance of nature and the enduring strength of a few.

On some levels it does, sometimes the old growl is there, but other times it just gets way too confused with the backing vocals.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I purchased this book on March 6th because I heard about it on the news.  Very interesting book and I am now reading book 2.  However, after I finished the book, I tried to lend it to a friend and could not.  Apparently, the books popularity increased and Amazon, the Publisher, whoever, decided to remove it as a lendable book and then increased the price by $3.00, all in a weeks time.  I have a hard time accepting this.  At the least, people who purchased the book under the pretense that it could be loaned, should be grand-fathered in.  Not cool Amazon!<br /><br />Aside from that, the book is very intense and eye-opening.  For me it was very hard to put down and I'm already into Chapter 2 of the second book.
B004AHNIGM|3.0|I was expecting a lot from this album and Gregg, I'm not too sure if I see what it is all about. Too many Lows to outdo the good on this album. I really struggle to listen to it, each time I pick up something new, but...I dont know, I just found it a bit disappointing.
630469654X|3.0|One of the unique characteristics of the fantasy genre is that the tales typically have a timeless quality about them.  However, if you decide to interpolate cheesy synth-pop into said story in order that it might be appealing to contemporary audiences it makes your movie forever \\"dated\\" (i.e. the 80's) and furthermore undermines the fantasy atmosphere.  Seriously, imagine if Lucas had decided to go with disco music for Star Wars or if Jackson had went with hip-hop for the LOTR movies.  Of course I'm not suggesting for a moment that Ladyhawke is even close to these movies as far as scale, rather I'm presenting these analogies to demonstrate that with another musical score this would possibly be an entirely different film.<br /><br />What's good:  epic story; i.e. jealous cleric dooms a vow of love by cursing the pair to a life of being together but never really being together because one is a wolf by night while the other is a hawk by day until the balance is tipped by a lowly thief (solid fantasy or even romance plot).  Rutger Hauer (Captain Etienne) was made for the role of a fantasy hero, Matthew Broderick (The Mouse) plays a quintessential, witty rogue with a soft heart most excellently and Michelle Pfeiffer (Isabeau) is just...  well beautiful (that's what she's supposed to be for this story to work).<br /><br />What's bad:  The music!  That's it in a nutshell, if you can get past that then it's a great movie but if you're like me and you just can't ignore it then you should probably save your money and hope eventually Warner Brothers will re-score this otherwise imaginative and visually attractive fantasy flick.<br /><br />[Update: 2/21/13] Amazon has actually included this in their Instant Video library and free to Prime members and I STILL couldn't bring myself to sit through the terrible music. Lol, am I all alone in this opinion?!?!

144472293X|1.0|This is not a review that I would expect anyone to use as a base for their reason to read/not read this book. I have not actually read it all the way through myself.<br />I did read Delirium and thought it was a fantastic novel and was very believable. I appreciated all the characters and although the ending was heart breaking, I thought it fit in well with the concept behind the story. That said, over the last year I have held on to the hope that Alex would be alive in this novel.<br />*Spoiler Warning*<br />I saw the summary for this book over on Goodreads and didn't like the mention of her potentially falling in love again. Yes I know that it happens, but after the love she shared with Alex I didn't believe that it would be right for her to move on so quickly and not to attempt to at least find out if he really was dead. I began reading it and skipped to the end as I had a pretty good feeling that he would be alive and that she would be in love with someone else... And alas I was right. Typical YA author attempting the tacky love triangle scenario. Personally, I think it's really unnecessary. What happened to old fashioned one guy one girl?<br />Not happy at all.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|I just went and saw the best movie I have seen since Star Wars came out in the early 1977.  In fact this story by Edgar Rice Burroughs called a Princess of Mars was the main source of many ideas that Lucas used to make Star Wars.  The movie is called John Carter, whom is the main charter of a Princess of Mars and many other Mars stories by Burroughs.  The movie is simply great!  Very close to the book, there are a few changes from the book, but Disney Studios did a much better job of being like the book than most movies do.  You can see this movie in either 2D or 3D, and I assume that will be true of the DVD as well when it comes out.  We went to the 2D and are going back to see the 3D this weekend.  Just though I would pass this on.

B003ZMF26W|5.0|The Cooler Master Storm Inferno isn't just any mouse, it's the perfect mouse (for me at least). From its sleek design to its performance, this mouse is amazing. I have gone through many mice, and this one definitely is the one. Lets talk about the looks. It has a black glossy finish with nice red LED lights on the front, mouse wheel, and on the palm rest. Everything feels of high quality, the mouse wheel is wide and flat making it easy to press, and the macro buttons are where they should be and aren't all over the place. I usually like simplistic mouses with few buttons, but this one has just the right amount. The box it came with was very nice although inside it had no manual or terms and conditions, in fact it was just the mouse and the software CD. The software is easy to use and looks great. This mouse does not require software running to execute all commands which is nice. If I were to buy another mouse, it would be a replacement. This mouse is the best 10/10.
B006ZT47O0|5.0|A lot has been said of this album, both good and bad. Personally I don't see how anybody could hear anything in this but brilliance and beautiful music. Simone's voice is above and beyond any expectation I could have possibly dream of. The instrumentals are sublime. Mark's grunts are less than DYU and over all the album is very remanicent of Divine Conspiracy, which I thought was previously their best work.<br /><br />I have nothing but glowing praise for this album. The songs are catchier than ever, Simone's voice is more beautiful than ever and the music is exquisite. I would reccomend this album to anybody who is at all interested in metal.<br /><br />Is it as heavy as Design Your Universe? No, but it's far more beautiful than that album and a brilliant step forward for a brilliant band!
B005F3XV7Q|4.0|If you can get past the silliness of the plot,<br />there are many funny scenes and dialogue. It is<br />more of a romantic comedy, but the talking animals<br />will appeal to children, though much of the humor<br />would be over their heads. Best for teens? ?
B004QXJZXA|5.0|The Blu-ray DVD version of this classic Steve McQueen movie was light years ahead of both the tap and DVD versions I've seen.  Both the sound and the Picture quality were as good as seeing it in the theaters in 1972!  I also appreciated the extra tap on the making of the movie and the interview with Steve's son Chad about his experience with Steve's 911 that was used in the movie and the 917.

B0034G4P4O|5.0|I've read the Tintin comic books (have all the hardcover sets they sell here on Amazon), and have seen the Nelvana cartoon series (which is pretty much completely lifted from the comic books).  Love them all!  So many times I have been disappointed when Hollywood takes something I love, adapts it to the big screen, and completely ruins it so that any resemblance between the movie and the original is pure coincidence.  With Spielberg and Jackson at the helm, I expected a high quality production, but what about the actual story?<br /><br />This movie takes elements from three Tintin books - \\"The Crab with the Golden Claws\\", \\"The Secret of the Unicorn\\", and \\"Red Rackham's Treasure\\".  Most of \\"The Crab...\\" that's in the movie is about how Tintin and Captain Haddock met.  In \\"Unicorn\\", the flea market scenes actually took place AFTER Tintin and Haddock met, as Tintin had bought the model ship as a gift for his friend.  But in the movie, he bought the ship before he met Haddock.<br /><br />But unless you are that much of a stickler for details, this shouldn't matter.  With the exception of these few details, the story was very true to the books and the Nelvana animated series.  What was even better was how the characters were written; I am sure Herge would have approved, as they were just as he intended them to be.  All the personality quirks of Tintin, Snowy, Captain Haddock, Thomson & Thompson, etc - all there as we remember them.  I thought they did a great job with the casting, as well.<br /><br />I was afraid they'd ruin this movie by doing something dumb like bringing on a love interest for Tintin (something that never happened in the books, but Hollywood often can't leave stuff alone).  This is an adventure story, not a romance, and it was wise of Spielberg/Jackson to treat it as such.<br /><br />The ending of the movie left me begging for a sequel.  I hope they do make one, and it's to the same standards as this one.  This Tintin fan loved it!
0385534639|4.0|I read this book after my wife recommended it to me.  I had some trepidation of it being a \\"chick lit\\" novel based on a Twilight-style love triangle, which is definitely not my usual cup of tea.<br /><br />However, I was pleasantly surprised as the imagery and vivid world of the Circus definitely took center stage, which is far and away the strength of the novel.  It makes you wish for a movie to be made with amazing visual scenes to match what your imagination has invoked reading the descriptions of the various tents of the Circus.  The descriptions of the Circus alone make the novel worth reading.<br /><br />The characters were handled pretty well and were consistent, but I felt like none of them had their personality fleshed out enough for them to feel real or for me to love or hate any of them.  I feel like there should have been a lot more dialogue between the main characters as their actual face-to-face interactions were never the main focus of the book, and instead most of the book takes place inside their heads and their actual interactions dealt with briefly or indirectly.  Most of the characters played their roles and fit into the storyline for the most part, although some seemed to exist as nothing more than a plot device (e.g. Tsusiko).<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the book and loved the world of the Night Circus, but the wonderful imagery and descriptions of the tents and time-jumping which are the best parts of the book also leave you feeling the characters got pushed to the side somewhat.
B007BDK3SS|1.0|The only good thing about this game is the graphics, it is impossible. If you aren't perfect at everything you cannot play this game. The controls suck and are way too sensitive.
B004BLTNJI|5.0|Fabulous story and very immersive 3d! Spooky. One of the better 3d produced movies in my collection.<br />I highly recommend you add this one to your stable.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The accuweather app is great. It's simple, informative and free. It will be one of those apps that you use daily. It also runs great on the kindle fire!
B004HO6I4W|1.0|We recently purchased a 3D tv and were anxious to add 3D movies to our collection.  We purchased Rio 3D and did NOT enjoy the quality of the 3D.  Within the first 10 minutes of the movie, everyone had a headache (have watched other 3D movies without a problem), and switched it back to 2D setting.<br /><br />Quality of the 3D:  HORRIBLE<br /><br />Movie rating:  5 stars!  Excellent film (just horrible in home 3D)
0316098329|5.0|The novel ROOM captivated me from the first sentence as it is exceptional writing from the first words to the last!! Written from the perspective of a five year old, one would think it may be juvenile but it deals with a subject that is adult and horrific.  But the reader can easily handle the subject as the eloquent prose leave you wanting more and thinking about ROOM long after that last word!
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|My 3 y/o daughter loves this movie so much more than the Tinkerbell and the Lost Treasure.  She really loves Vidia and Rosetta and Clank and Bobble and they just weren't in the last movie enough.  This one really dives more into everyone's personalities more and having Tink interact with a human girl is relate-able for little kids.  The Blu-Ray version is beautiful and the DVD gets used too in the portable DVD player on trips.  If your kids already love the other movies do yourself a favor and add this one to your collection.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Quite a lot better than most of this genra.  Longer than usual also. Some of the mini games are all to easy, while the astral board mini games can be frustrating. All in all, I enjoyed playing this one!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Simply the best movie-making on cable. Acting, writing, cinematography are all first-rate.  Watch it from the beginning and give yourself plenty of time to watch right on through.
B0064NTZJO|4.0|A well done movie.  Has class.  Good soundtrack applied well.  Not too much talk.  Plenty of silence in between communication.  No special effects.  A real love story here makes this movie a very good movie.  Affection between Ryan and boy really works.  Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan are great.  All actors are very good in this movie.  Took some time to get used to Albert Brooks as a gangster, but it worked for me by the third viewing.<br /><br />Some fun car chases.  Some fun cars.  Classy to choose a 1975 Malibu (modified with a great engine I'm sure) as Ryan's car.<br /><br />Are there any holes in this movie?  Sure.  And it has some rather violent, bloody moments.  Also, no way a car can crash into another car at high speed and the headlights still work.  A few other holes but not looking for perfection here.<br /><br />In Ryan Gosling you get a driver for armed robbers, film stunt man, mechanic, all around great and loving father figure and boyfriend, and a killer.  His love for Carey wins out.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I like this game. It keeps you entertained in a fun way. It has to be one of the best games right next to &quot;Paranormal Agency&quot;.

B0018QQQK8|4.0|Do you believe in luck? Or better yet, love at first sight? In The Lucky One, Nicholas Sparks uses his classic ways of telling this story about Logan, a marine, and Elizabeth, a teacher. It begins in Iraq, Logan Thibault sees a photograph of a beautiful woman laying in the hot sand of the Middle East. He just excepted that another marine had dropped it, so he posts in on the bulletin board so that some one could claim it. When that doesn't happen, Logan retrieves the photo and carries it with him on his three tours. Some how managing to dodge bullets and car bombs left and right, along with winning a poker game or two. Once Logan's time in the marines was over, after some thinking and help from a friend he decides to track down the woman in the picture. After walking across the country for about five months or so, he finds her. Their story together takes some wild twists and turns along the way. Including the fellow marine who really owned the picture and a psychotic ex-husband.<br /><br />The characters in this novel where great and just how you would imagine. A marine who is quiet, yet strong and powerful and full of talent. An ex-husband, Keith, whom I hated right off the bat. He really got under my skin and I just wanted Logan to beat him up! The son, Ben, whom I adored! He was so sweet and you just want hug him when you hear his story. Elizabeth, she was something else. She second thinks a lot of things, but what mother doesn't?And Nana, she was so lovable and hard headed at the same time.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this one, but who doesn't enjoy Nicholas Sparks? It was a bit more simple than some of the other ones he has written. The ending was a little shocking and kinda throws you through a loop, but still good. I am not sure it this is a good thing or not, but I did not get emotional over this one. With Message in A Bottle, I cried for like ten minute. I can't wait to see the film adaptation of this novel. It doesn't hurt that hottie Zac Efron is playing Logan. :)<br /><br />I would recommend this to my friends of course.playing Logan. :)<br /><br />I would recommend this to my friends of course.
B007BDK3SS|2.0|Frustrating controls implemented in an interesting game. I like the idea, but the execution leaves much to be desired.<br /><br />The controls are just to finicky for me to enjoy myself and I feel like I am constantly fighting the controls when I just want to enjoy myself.
1439152756|5.0|This book was a page turner!  I didn't realize the trials and tribulations of these poor people who have to go through the struggle of losing their memory.  Not only do they forget things but they also have hallucinations that are terrifying.  This book helped me to be more compassionate to older people struggling with this disease.  It scared me to thinking that I have the beginning of this terrible disease!
B006OAB3ME|5.0|As always, I still love Paul McCarteny and any of the music he preforms and writes!!

B006ZT47O0|2.0|Simply, this album is a disappointment. There is not one song on it that stands out, not one moment that really made me take notice of what I was listening to. I think Epica may have peaked with the Divine Conspiracy and Design Your Universe (easily the two masterpiece albums from this band's career so far). I felt like I was listening to the most bland product that Epica could have put out. All the elements are there - the choir, Simone's vocals, Mark's growling, the thick-themed lyrics, and so on - but it's nothing special at all. Where's my \\"Tides of Time\\"? Where is my \\"Fools of Damnation?\\" I get chills when I hear each one of those songs. On RFtI, nothing stands out; in addition, the production is so-so...the volume could have been raised a tad, keeping with their last couple albums.<br /><br />On another note, the song \\"Serenade of Self-Destruction,\\" despite having the manufacturer error of having no Mark/Simone vocal lines, it works well as an instrumental all by itself.<br /><br />So yeah, being a humongous Epica fan, I am sorely disappointed by this new release. Better luck next time!
B00479SVBU|5.0|Bought this little gadget a few months ago for my car.  I considered a new stereo with an AUX input but didn't want to spend a lot of dough.  I looked in to this one and as far as FM transmitters go I was impressed.  It doesn't have super clear quality like an AUX input or CD player but it comes pretty close, plus the simplicity and convenience pay dividends.  Lots of options too; remote control, AUX input/output, and SD card slot.  The signal it transmits is respectable as well.  I've had no issues with it, just plug it in your cigarette lighter, toss in your media and go.

B004132HZS|5.0|Typically when classic stories are adapted to modern times, they are adapted to modern values as well. The story often suffers as a vehicle for promoting modern values. The focus in this adaptation was character development and storyline. The attention given to the characters and connecting to the essence and substance of Conan Doyle's original work was very refreshing. I suppose it's a good thing it came from the BBC rather than Hollywood.
B0053KWDES|2.0|I wish I had read more on the internet before buying the E11, which I ended up returning.  Although some comments about the sound quality are positive there are some negative ones as well in forum threads.  Look especially on head-fi and headfonia, especially the shoot-out of sub $100 amps.  Overall the E11 did not significantly improve the overall sound quality I got from a 4xx series Sony Walkman with the included Sony phones, the Soul SL49s, or the MeElectronics A151s.  As others have noted the similarly priced JDSLabs cMoyBB sounds much better.
B002R5QPRI|5.0|When Whitney Houston died, I told my kids about her movie, The Bodyguard.  I wanted them to see it and was delighted to see how easy it was to rent it on Amazon.  Thank you for an enjoyable afternoon at a reasonable cost.
B0019N8P2W|4.0|The only reason I didn't give this a 5/5 is that the DVD box was pretty much broken by the time I got it. I'm planning on buying something else to hold them in, as I can't actually CLOSE the box (or at least, not without 5 minutes of rearranging everything first!).<br /><br />However, the quality is pretty much perfect, even if some of the songs are changed (I didn't actually notice much, to be honest) and for the price I paid, I'm super happy with this purchase!!<br /><br />Already recommended it to friends!
B00002SWEM|5.0|The Buena Vista Social Club contains true Cuban music, primarily from the 1940's and 50's.  It is played by a band put together from artists who knew their greatest popularity in those eras, and it's a charmer.  I have fallen in love with all those old dudes ( plus one timeless lady).  Anyone enjoying the cd should also get the video about making the recording and their tour, ending in Carnegie Hall.  It is such a thrill so see those old folks really enjoying themselves in New York.  I recommend that you get both the cd and video; in addition, the lead artists each made individual recordings that are also wonderful to listen to.
B001TK8TJO|5.0|This book is awesome for ANYONE. Not just people getting prepared for marriage, or in a marriage, but anyone who has any kind of relationship-- which is everyone! This book gives great insight to our relationship goals and makes our differences known, which if known, can avoid some hard conflicts that could arise. It's a valid point to know your friends and loved ones love language becuase you will have a lot of awareness of certain behaviors. This book was a condition for a family friend to marry my fiance and I and it's the best recommendation anyone could have given us!

B00005JKHP|1.0|For years this was one of the two Star Trek Movies I did not own. But the reviews saying the directors cut was like a whole new movie, and the way it should have been done in the first place intreged me, so I thought I would give it another chance. But after watching it I am telling you it does not matter what you do to the visual effects, or what scenes you add or delete, this is still a really bad movie. In an episode of the Big Bang theory the characters are arguing which is the worst Star Trek Movie. Sheldon says \\"Star Trek V has specific problems in writing and direction. Star Trek I has mistakes across the board: writing, art direction, costumes, editing.\\" He is spot on, this movie has so many issues. The biggest problem for me is my beloved characters are just so stiff and wooden. They tried to recreate the magic of the show, but it comes accross forced. And a some of the dialogue they removed, such as Kirk stating he hopes there is a life form in the cloud that reasons the way we do, made no sense. The only good thing about this set is the second disc has a nice feature on how working on a second TV show turned into this project. In summary this movie was bad when it came out and still is. Dont waste your money
0345522478|4.0|Loved this one!  The mixture of the different Celtic gods with the other religions mentioned was very interesting. Atticus was like a male Kate Daniels (that's a good thing since I love Kate).  He had a good mix of old world thinking and new school attitude. There was a lot of humor without being over the top. Oberon was a great character and his thought processes were believably \\"doggy.\\" I can't wait to pick up the next books in this series!

0307593312|5.0|Aomame and Tengo grow apart as they grow up. The story is about whether they will ever grow together; or whether something(s) will keep that from happening. We spend the book with them as they grow old enough to cause an ending to actually take place; or, perhaps, another beginning.<br /><br />With a limited number of characters (just enough to work, but not so many as to get in the way), the author weaves his own brand of magic into their lives. Not surprisingly, the readers are allowed to join in on the magic. We get to sense what they do. We get to believe what they do. Or not believe it at all. Regardless, we get to go on a lengthy journey of thoughts and dreams.<br /><br />Are their events ones that remind us of the world of a little more than a quarter of a century ago? Are their events ones that remind us of today? Yes. And, yes. But, which events are they and do they apply to us in any way similar to the ways they affected Aomame and Tengo? It will probably take longer to answer that for myself than it took me to read the book.<br /><br />I don't always understand Haruke Murakami. But, it may be that he wants us to take from each of his books that which we want. Though I always hope for more insight into what he means, I keep reading them because they always give my brain a wonderful sort of exercise. This was well worth the effort.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|If you like this app I highly suggest you get &quot;Spawn 3D&quot;, they are both quite similar, but Spawn seems slightly better. This game is quite good at keeping me entertained though.
0385341008|5.0|The format of this book was a very interesting approach to story telling. While the letters seemed very whimsical the story itself was anything but that. By telling the story of WWII occupation of the Island in this manner, it put a very human face on the terrible times. It is a book I have recommended many times and continue to do so.
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|There's not much really to not like about \\"Wrecking Ball.\\" Unless it is that this doesn't sound much like a Bruce Springsteen anyone has ever heard before. Or Bruce is getting too political. He tries a lot of new things out. Thank God. Artists have their nuances. If anyone fails to listen to \\"Wrecking Ball\\" out of political mixed feelings or a sense they have philosophical axes to grind with Springsteen, however, they're missing out on a nice bunch of Springsteen songs.<br /><br />The record is more about breaking new ground than it is about taking sides. If he has a comfort zone, Springsteen isn't enjoying it on this album. There has been very little mention of \\"This Depression\\" in most reviews I've read. I think it's because the song is so lacking a familiar Springsteen point of reference. There's nothing Boss-related in \\"This Depression,\\" which features beautiful siren-sounds welling up beneath a confession of despair and plea for help.<br /><br />The first few songs on \\"Wrecking Ball\\"-- \\"We Take Care of Our Own,\\" \\"Easy Money,\\" and \\"Quartered and Drawn\\"-- stick to areas that people relate to when they think about the Boss. There he goes, stirring up depression-era rivalries and partisan working-man politics, defending the downtrodden, going after the privileged. Catching an earful of the political-sounding blast of \\"Wrecking Ball\\"s opening numbers, some listeners may feel it's an angry left-wing protest album, and resolve to pass it by.<br /><br />\\"We Take Care of Our Own,\\" \\"Death to My Hometown,\\" and \\"Jack of All Trades,\\" it is true, appear to march off to battle against the fat cats and Wall Street scoundrels who laid waste to America.  \\"Easy Money\\" ridicules the alluring pipe dreams that came true for a few. But \\"Rocky Ground\\" speaks to everyone in whom something is entrusted, no matter their rung of life, as it cautions, \\"Tend to your flock or they will stray, we'll be called for our service come Judgement Day, Before we cross that river wide, blood on our hands will come back on us twice.\\" Immediately after the word \\"twice\\" a beautiful horn arrangement makes good on the proclamation earlier on in the song of \\"angels singing 'Glory Hallelujah.'\\" The \\"I'm a Soldier\\" refrain in this song gets a little old for my liking, but it's kind of cool the first couple of times. One of the finest works of Springsteen's imagination. Thus far.<br /><br />\\"We Take Care of our Own\\" sounds a little bit ironic, sarcastic even, for Springsteen. Some may wonder, have we come this far only to end up in .  .  . in Randy Newman territory?<br /><br />Maybe not. Who does takes care of their own? Bruce Springsteen and the E. Street Band? Street Gangs? The Cosa Nostra? (It is an Army motto.)<br /><br />\\"Jack of All Trades\\" is a snapshot of a  guy who is out of work and now must turn to the humblest of tasks in order to provide for his family. Luckily he's good at them. It's notable how many words he is given to sing without saying anything. Trying to turn lemons into lemonade he goes on and on, verse after verse, muttering feel-good platitudes and mixed up pieties (Jesus didn't mention \\"might\\"). It's as if our man senses if he ever stopped talking his real feelings might pop out and he and everyone else would know. When finally he does gets around to saying what is really on his mind, he does so in the measured tones of a stoic handy man capable of handling his circumstances. The soaring, weeping guitar that immediately follows his confession conveys that there is a more passionate story to tell.<br /><br />The best numbers on \\"Wrecking Ball\\" for getting up and getting down are, oddly enough, \\"Quartered and Drawn\\" and \\"Death to my Home Town.\\"<br /><br />\\"Land of Hopes and Dreams\\" is a number with a familiar feel to it. The sonic centerpiece and emotional high point of \\"Wrecking Ball,\\" it harks back to another time and place. A time when Clarence Clemons was alive. (And so was his home town.)<br /><br />A few days ago, I was looking at a video of \\"Land of Hopes and Dreams.\\" It was from a Springsteen/E. Street Band concert about a decade ago. It was a far different song from the version on \\"Wrecking Ball.\\" The blissed-out E-Streeter strummers behind Bruce were jumping around, banging away happily at the silly-sounding guitar-trills that dressed up the song. More innocent times .  .  . That's gone here, in favor of a big time, pull out all the stops production. It's assured that Clarence Clemons gets a fitting spotlight on the record.<br /><br />The closing song, \\"We Are Alive,\\" is on its own musically (while lyrically it stakes out a spot a bit to the other end of the universe from Bankers' Hill).<br /><br />At first hearing, I thought that \\"We are Alive\\" was a bit too lightweight & goofy, especially to be the final song. Is \\"Wrecking Ball\\" going to go out with a whimper and not a bang?  On second thought, my memory drifted to the song \\"Good Night\\"  at the end of the Beatles' \\"White Album.\\"<br /><br />In \\"We Are Alive\\" bygone beings who are weary of the same old graveyard garb confess a longing to stop being alone in the dark every night with worms crawling in and out of them. Taking matters into their own bones, they end this record by putting on a dusty old 45 and rocking around the tombstones to the tune of spaghetti western music  seasoned with Johnny Cash. It is an interesting song. Listen closely and you'll hear Don Quijote, singing at the top of his voice, \\"Bring on Your Wrecking Ball.\\"
B0052UZIFA|1.0|The game looks terrible. It also freezes after a short time and has to be closed down to stop the music from playing. Skip it until it gets some support.
0375704027|3.0|I really don't understand why this became a bestseller...The main characters (Toru and Naoko) were weak. Nagasawa and Midori were much more lively and interesting.<br />It seemed that this story had a pattern: pretty girls (Naoko, Hatsumi, etc) were screwed up. The women were needy (every single one of them, even Midori) and even though Naoko was borderline schizophrenic and extremely uninteresting, Toru believed he was in love.<br /><br />My take on this story is that he felt that Naoko was his responsability because of his deceased friend, believed he had to care for her and mistakenly believed that what he felt for Naoko was love. In the end, Midori didn't want him back and that's why he started the book so sad, lost in his memories. He lost a lot in 4 years; his best friend, couldn't help his friend's girlfriend and lost a girl who would have died for him.

1401937519|5.0|WOW Anita!  I could end there and that would be enough.  You are such a beautiful and courageous Soul.  Thank you for reminding me of what is true about myself and helping me to eliminate all the falsehoods.  Your book reads like poetry as you take me on a journey from a lost Soul to one who finally sees and allows their magnificence.<br /><br />I'm glad that you reminded me that there was nothing that I had to do to be magnificent.  I'm glad that you reminded me that I Am \\"all that is\\" and I only have to decide which part of \\"all that is\\" that I wanted to experience and then allow that energy to flow through me effortlessly.<br /><br />I'm glad that you told me one of the most important things that I could do in life is to live fearlessly and to laugh often (especially at myself).  I'm glad that you reminded me that when I'm happy then the whole world experiences that happiness because we are all one.<br /><br />I'm glad that you reminded me that the way that I see myself will be reflected my outer world and not the other way around.  In truth you reminded me that there is no \\"out there...out there\\" and there is only an \\"in here...in here. This encourages me always be wiling to go within when I'm seeking answers.  You reminded me that I was born with the answers to all of my questions and they lie within.  You freed me from ever having to seek another guru, religion, dogma, book, or coach and that when I go within that I may be led to one of these sources to help point the way but they are definitely not a necessity.<br /><br />I found you at a time in my life when I \\"needed\\" you the most.  I see in myself how much I've lived in fear for so many years and how that has manifested in the world that I now see.  I have equated things that I have done in life to who I am and the results have been devastating. Before buying and reading the book I watched an interview with you and the thing I noticed the most is how much you smiled and laughed which is so rare in the world today. I'm now encouraged to take life more light-heartedly and to laugh more.<br /><br />I appreciate you so much for sharing your story.  I thank Dr. Dyer (one of my favorite authors) for helping to bring your story to the world. I felt your unconditional love for humanity burst off the pages of this book.  I'm delighted you didn't give me 7 steps, 25 rules, more guidelines, more religion or more dogma to adhere to.  I'm delighted that you encouraged me to just be myself and allow myself to be guided in a way that feels most natural to me.  Your story allows me to tailor a plan that is specifically made for personal journey.  Its been a while since I sat down and read a book from cover to cover but your book was definitely worth every second that I dedicated to reading it.<br /><br />I promise that I will not just let this book be another one that collects dust on a shelf.  I promise that I will use your story and words of encouragement to live my life more courageously and on purpose.  I promise that I will remind myself of my magnificence even on the days when things are not going according to my plans.  I promise that I will let go and let the infinity of who I am flow through and guide me to a wondrous life on planet earth.  I Love You.d today. I'm now encouraged to take life more light-heartedly and to laugh more.<br /><br />I appreciate you so much for sharing your story.

I'm delighted that you encouraged me to just be myself and allow myself to be guided in a way that feels most natural to me.  Your story allows me to tailor a plan that is specifically made for personal journey.  Its been a while since I sat down and read a book from cover to cover but your book was definitely worth every second that I dedicated to reading it.<br /><br />I promise that I will not just let this book be another one that collects dust on a shelf.  I promise that I will use your story and words of encouragement to live my life more courageously and on purpose.  I promise that I will remind myself of my magnificence even on the days when things are not going according to my plans.  I promise that I will let go and let the infinity of who I am flow through and guide me to a wondrous life on planet earth.  I Love You.
B005HSG3U6|3.0|Handy design and you'll need such a product if you purchase a kindle or kindle fire, but the quality here is less than desirable.  Bends easily so doesn't shut tight after a few uses.  Elastic wears quickly and loses strength.  Needs better materials but keep design.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Short and sweet....read all three books in the series.  Initially, I was a little nervous about the subject, however the author made both characters human and believable.  The question of Christian and how he became the man we initially meet is what keeps him human throughout the series. The love that grows between these two people is human, at times upsetting, but in the end it gives hope.  You have to read these books and keep going through all three books.
0439023521|1.0|Intrigued by the marketing of the title and the movie I decided to read the book.  Boring, hard to get through, had to stop.  You have to buy into the fantasy to have any motivation to continue, and this reader couldn't suspend reality necessary to become engaged with the plot or characters.  It may appeal to teen readers, Harry Potter types.
B0048JEEH4|5.0|This is one of the best albums I have ever heard.  The musical arrangements, lyrics, and Adele's voice are just phenominal. This album allows the listener to enjoy several different musical genre; and, one is as enjoyable as the next. The lyrics of Rolling in the Deep pull at our heartstrings as we remember our first lost love too; but, oh how dramatic that music is with that drum!  Everything about this album is wonderful.  I thank God for the marvelous talent He has given this young woman.  And I thank Adele for sharing that talent with us!<br /><br />Bevy

B000002NZO|2.0|If you were farsighted enough to acquire this album when it was first released you are a visionary.  If you are a true fan of Genesis, by all means check this out.  I am a died in the wool progressive rock fan.  Yes, Moody Blues, Jethro Tull, ELP, King Crimson, Genesis; I owned nearly every bit of vinyl they released.  If you are a Genesis fan and already have Foxtrot, Lamb Lies Down, Trick of the Tail, Duke and you want to understand where the band came from and you don't have From Genesis To Revelation, buy it before this one.  If you have almost the entire collection, and this is the last piece of the puzzle, it's not bad.  If you're not steeped in Genesis, there are better places to spend your dime.  I really enjoy Genesis but this is not the most interesting music they ever produced.  When this album was released it was very much ahead of it's time; however IMO the creativity in some of their later albums exceedes the Trespass album.

B00005N6KG|5.0|I needed to replace an older pair of Sony headphones. I like this particular style and they are hard to find. They are very lightweight and seem to be made of all plastic. I only use them at night while listening to certain cassette tapes before falling asleep so these headphones will work out just fine. They sound well, clear on either very low or high volume. I'm happy with the price,quality and overall purchase :)

0547424779|5.0|This story presents a world that is so wonderful it's terrifying. The book is well-written, short, easy to read and understand, but, in my opinion, that does not make it a kid's book. I think children lack the past-present-future perspective necessary to successfully experience this story. Even adults can get lost in its depth and miss the true meaning of the circumstances and choices made by the characters and the consequences of these choices. In any case, if you enjoy dystopian fiction, you should not miss this book.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I have been using it for sometime now.... And I must say it not only fits the bill but also a great value. I keep a camera body, 17-40 lens, 70-300 lens, 50 mm fixed with body, 2 point and shoot camera and also one canon vixia camcorder... Enough room to carry everything you need... 3 other pockets are awesome and easy to access... I highly recommend it ...
B003Y5HWMW|3.0|It is a puzzle to me why the vocal, liberated women of the 21st century do not seem to be overly concerned about how shows like this exploit and objectify them. Every other scene in episode one of Game of Thrones had a naked woman in it and a mostly clothed man mounting her like a dog. I've read the books, and I know that this is consistent with Martin's writing, but this kind of information can be implied. The graphic visual is not crucial to the story. In fact, it grinds the story to a halt every time, to the point where it becomes comical.<br /><br />The greatest films leave so much to the imagination, but the cable networks like HBO and Showtime seem to have a fascination with dragging their shows to the borderline of pornography. I suppose the execs at these networks are trying to cash in on a piece of that multi billion dollar industry. I also suspect that many of these execs have sons and daughters. I wonder how proud they would be to see their own children disrobing and simulating (?) graphic sex acts on film for the whole world to see? People are classifying this as an adult fantasy, but I couldn't help imagining the production team of Game of Thrones as a group of pubescent junior high boys sitting around the monitors and giggling about all the naked women in the show.<br /><br />Alternately, The Lord of the Rings is a truly adult fantasy that draws concepts like honor, sacrifice and beauty in much sharper relief. And the irony is that the Lord of the Rings has an even stronger sex appeal than Game of Thrones could ever hope to have because Tolkien was able to employ the art of subtext and the power of suggestion to a greater effect. I for one would love to see the Game of Thrones production team focus next season more on the truly adult themes of this great story like loyalty, friendship and justice, and stop insulting our intelligence with porn.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I bought the first book on Wednesday and by Friday, I have read all three.  This genre is not my normal type, I prefer Historical Romances, but when I heard kelly Ripa mention it, I had to see what all the hubbub was about.  Holy Hell in a handbasket....this was an amazing story.  Not necessarily the BDSM (I too had to look up that acronym), but it makes sense with the story.  His pathological need for control, her alarming innocence.  I have read thousands upon thousands of books, and some have moved me emotionally, but the ending of Book one literally had me in tears.  I felt her pain, her sadness, her isolation.  His heartbreak was just as bad, though so emotionally controlled, it explained a lot.<br /><br />To me it was less about the BDSM world and more about a tortured soul needing an escape from his own pain.  In walks (or falls) this beautiful innocent and he is lost, confused, and enamored.  She see's his pain from the beginning and is willing to help him heal.  It's a long hard road for both of them and the true test is not whether she can become part of his world, but will he let her into his heart.<br /><br />I fell in love with Ana and Christian and I hope I can visit them again.
B000005JA8|5.0|Beefheart was sheer genius.<br /><br />  I believe TROUT MASK REPLICA released in June 1969 was a pre-parody of EXILE ON MAIN STREET by The Rolling Stones.<br /><br />  On his earlier STRICTLY PERSONAL Album he had already composed a song--Beatle Bones 'N' Smokin' Stones, poking fun at The Beatles and The Stones.<br /><br />  But get this. TROUT MASK REPLICA of 1969 was not a glimpse ahead to the initial 1972 release of EXILE, it looked far ahead to the May 2010 re-release of EXILE which included 10 new songs bringing the song total of the EXILE CD to 28, the same number of songs on TROUT.<br /><br />  Think about it.

B001UV4XIS|1.0|I went for the Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital copy version because my previous experience with digital copies (all via iTunes) just worked.  Dealing with Apple and iTunes is generally a streamlined, professional experience.  To get an ultraviolet digital copy, you have to create two accounts and hope (in my case, vainly) that the web sites you deal with actually work.  And don't expect that the web address that flixter gives you for support with your digital copy actually knows _anything_ about the movie you are dealing with.  Overall, the only way I could assume that the flixter/ultraviolet system is a success is if the (secret) intent is simply to exasperate their customers rather than actually provide the product allegedly sold to the consumer.<br /><br />The movie itself was good.<br /><br />It's just the studio's (poor) attempt to keep more control and profit does not seem to be up to scratch.  It makes me think that the studios figured they could keep even more money from the digital movie sales if they skimped on the supporting infrastructure.<br /><br />I'm thinking the astute consumer will, in the future, exercise patience and wait until the cost of the used blu-ray media drops enough that they can afford to buy the blu-ray, burn the ultraviolet digital copy paper, and buy a copy of the movie from iTunes if they want a digital copy.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|I wasn't really that interested to see this movie when I first saw the trailers for it, and so I never saw it in theaters.  I ended up getting it for my husband for Valentine's Day because he mentioned it, and we both loved it! I had heard positive reviews, but thought it would be something that only really serious X-Men fans would like (like people who read the comic books and such, because I am a fan of the other X-Men movies and super heroes in general, but I've never been seriously into the X-Men).  I actually think this is the best of all the X-Men films.
1609611543|5.0|Usually, I'm not this personal when I review a book, but this book requires more of a firsthand, first person review.<br /><br />I'm like everyone else, I suppose. I've been on every diet there is. High carb. Low carb. High protein. No fat. Low fat. First fat makes you fat, then carbs make you fat. It's confusing and overwhelming. Then I heard about this [[ASIN:B00571F26Y Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back To Health]] book. I gave myself a couple of weeks to read the book, digest the information, and then made the important decision not to digest wheat. Cold turkey. The first three days were difficult, but then (and I know you've heard this before), it's like the fog lifted. I felt better, started losing weight, and had more energy. The pervasive soreness I've dealt with for the past few years has abated, and for that, I'm very thankful.<br /><br />Trying to find wheat-free foods, especially while eating out, is difficult, but not impossible. I find myself using the recipes in the Wheat Belly book and eating home more. And when I start to think that perhaps it's not really giving up wheat that made the difference, I go back to the research in the book - and there is plenty. I purchased the Kindle edition and I've highlighted all the way through so that I have quick and handy references. The research is a bit overwhelming, and this is not strictly a 'how-to' diet book, but it's more of a primer on why you should give up wheat and a launching pad of sorts with the recipes in the back.<br /><br />I started a blog a while back called \\"Sick and Tired Woman.\\" I have now changed the title to \\"Sick and Tired No More!\\" So, can giving up wheat really make a difference? In a word, yes. At least it did for me. Everyone's metabolism is different, but for me, this book has been a godsend. Highly recommended!

076790592X|4.0|I have read almost everyone of Mitch Albom's books that are heartfelt.  I think this was his first was this book and  while this one isn't my favorite or as memorable as say One More Day or Have A Little Faith. These honest books get to the heart of matters and always make me cry at some point.<br /><br />This is a quick read not because it is just simply written but because I eagerly wanted to learn what was next.  I love that the author always meets such interesting people to write about and they are such regular people, people you want to know.
6302797535|2.0|Murder By Death, 1976 film<br /><br />A man sends invitations to famous detectives (from fiction) to visit his mansion. [No mention of fees, so you know this isn't real.] Lionel Twain lives on an island. A rickety bridge connects to this island. The detectives arrive and are shown to their rooms. The new cook cannot speak, hear, or read English. The butler can't see. They try to communicate. Sam Diamond arrives with his secretary Tess. Next Dick and Dora Charleston. Inspector Wang arrives with his son Willy. Inspector Perrier arrives with his chauffeur Marcel. Is Wang wrong? Miss Jessica Marbles arrives with her nurse. Why five detectives? Perrier explains the test with Wang. Blind people have a keen sense of smell. \\"Tacky?\\" The blind butler talks to the deaf cook. The lights go dead. \\"Franks and beans?\\" Then Lionel Twain appears. [No joke here.] \\"You look like number two.\\"<br /><br />Can the five greatest detectives solve a murder in a locked mansion? Two million cash plus film rights? Charades? The cook draws their attention. \\"This man is dead.\\" \\"Where is everyone?\\" A voice speaks to them. \\"Say your pronouns.\\" They find the butler again. Then the dining room is empty again. [A cheap trick?] \\"Two dining rooms.\\" The cook disappeared. Midnight passes. They find a body, as predicted. \\"Nobody move!\\" Dick Charleston offers a solution, but Inspector Wang trumps him (and exposes a character). \\"I'm a Belgie!\\" There are more exposures and confessions from the others. [Believable?] There are threats for the occupants of each bedroom. [More silliness here.] Sidney Wang solves the crime! Who did it? A plastic body. Others have their solution. \\"How did you know?\\" There is a final surprise! When the show is over the detectives all leave. There is a final unmasking to end this story. Believable?<br /><br />This is a parody of Agatha Christie's famous murder mystery \\"Ten Little Indians\\". Those who write parodies are usually less talented than the original writer, as shown by thisstory. If you don't know of the other fictional detectives you will miss the point of this story. A parody is limited to the original story. The ending with the switching of identities damages this story, as if they don't know when to end this joke.<br />Dashiell created \\"Nick and Nora Charles\\" and \\"Sam Spade\\"(\\"The Thin Man\\", \\"The Maltese Falcon\\"). \\"Mr Wong\\" was a copy of \\"Charlie Chan\\". Agatha Christie created \\"Hercule Poirot\\" and \\"Miss Marple\\" for many mystery novels.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book in Kindle version after hearing the dramatic hype surrounding it - what an error! Wasted 10 bucks for nothing. I should have read all the 1 star reviews first, but instead I was telling my hubby all those hundreds of 5 star reviews couldn't be wrong. He said well, they could. I didn't believe him and instead bought it on impulse to satisfy my irresistible curiosity. Actually, I wasn't hooked when I read the first 3 sneak chapters, but I was thinking maybe the story will get better or the writing will improve. And also to find out if the sex scenes were really that scorching as what some of the readers were proclaiming. Well, well, well --- SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />The story never got engaging. It was boring to say the least. And the setting of the story was quite juvenile for me. Not to mention the writing was too kiddy.<br />Lack of sophistication and a polished style that I usually favor. It was like one of those novels I read back in high school. Nice college girl fell for a rich bad boy who has a BDSM side. He opened her eyes to this lifestyle and she was fascinated/scared but couldn't help herself as she wanted to build a relationship with him. Predictably, she freaked out in the end. The in-between sex scenes were so-so. I had read many other books with much more erotic/stimulating scenes from romance writers like Susan Johnson, Bertrice Small, Shayla Black.<br /><br />I cannot tell why so many readers gave 5 stars for this book. Maybe it's a matter of taste and preference. This is definitely too immature for me and my level.<br />I'd not spend 10 bucks on another book like that again without listening to my instinct. And yes, those hundreds of 5 star reviews could be wrong! Got the I-told-you-so look from my hubby after I finished the book. Well, what do I know. Don't make the same mistake that I did!!! Save your money for a better, more worthy of your time book.

I am currently on the third book, \\"Mocking Jay. If you are looking for a book, I would defiantly recommend this.

0439023521|4.0|As a newbie novelist, I have read several books on novel construction. And I also have a keen interest in reading low ratings of novels (one or two stars) to harness some insight on what didn't work for an author's particular book.<br /><br />After reading through all the one star reviews of The Hunger Games, there are two main points that I would like to address. I'm hoping my thoughts will give a better understanding of this novel's construction and why it was written in such a form. However, as stated in the title of my review, this does NOT pertain to those readers who are offended by the novel's main premise - children between the ages of 12 to 18 who are forced to kill each other - for which, as a parent, I can completely understand.<br /><br />Also, to make certain my hunch of this novel's writing was correct, I downloaded the first chapter of The Hunger Games. I read through most of the first chapter (and I found it quite compelling, pulling me right in to Katniss' life and description of her world), and plan on reading more.<br /><br />1. To all those one star reviewers who claim this novel has horrible writing (no great prose or \\"poorly written\\", lack of a use of sophisticated words, words and phrases repeated many times, etc.) - this story is written in the first person point of view, i.e. Katniss' point of view. Katniss is a teenage girl, of (I'm going to assume, since I haven't read the entire book yet) average to above average intelligence. And since it is from HER point of view, we, as readers, need to realize this. She will describe her world in her words, NOT Suzanne Collins words. What this means - The Hunger Games is not a novel which displays Suzanne Collins' artsy, advanced (or however you want to describe it) writing ability! Suzanne is telling this story through Katniss, and whatever writing ability, speaking ability, and general personality characteristics Katniss possesses - these will create the prose you read in this novel. And, similarly,this applies to Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series novels - Bella is speaking her mind, in her own words, and living her life in her own words (although, to be fair, I haven't read more than a few chapters of these books, so I don't know for certain if this was Stephenie's guiding template).<br /><br />Trust me, the moment an author intrudes upon a character, placing gracious, flowing prose, and large, advanced words, just to show \\"hey, look at me, am I not a super-intelligent and magnificent writer?\\", when the actual character would never use such words, neither in thoughts nor in speech, this is the moment a reader will feel a destructive distance and unease from the story and the character(s). We, as authors, need to keep it real!<br /><br />2. To all those one star reviewers who claim this novel was a rip-off of Battle Royale...oh boy, this is quite annoying. Do I believe Suzanne Collins copied parts of Battle Royale? Well, I can't say for certain, but, as a writer, I will tell you my feelings - the last thing I would ever want to do is copy another author's work! Blaahh!!! I would never want to write again if I had to do that! If an author cannot create a story from scratch, that is meaningful and somewhat precious to the author, in one means or another, then all may be lost. We all want to be original, don't we???<br /><br />BUT, that said, here is the catch-22. From several of my online readings on novel construction, one thing I learned very early is there are no truly original stories left anymore. Why? Simply because human beings' thoughts and dreams overlap. Yes, we all want to be original, but with so many billions of people upon this planet, the luck of the draw predicts your original story will most likely be similar to a story written before. And I truly believe, though I can't say with absolute certainty, this is the case of the similarities between The Hunger Games and Battle Royale. Suzanne wrote a story, from her own thoughts and from her own viewand interpretations of real-life situations. And, unfortunately (at least for many of the one star reviewers - some readers actually enjoy when stories are similar), the two stories are quite alike.<br /><br />So, one star reviewers, I hope this will enlighten, and maybe change, your disgruntled thoughts on The Hunger Games, only if, as I mentioned earlier, you are simply unhappy with the story because of \\"poor writing\\" or its similarity to Battle Royale. If you are unhappy with the story's main plot, young people fighting to the death with only one remaining, then you need to find stories that fit your comfort zone.

1612130283|1.0|Being a fan of erotica, I was looking forward to reading this, considering how much publicity and praise it has received. Wow, was I disappointed. The writing of the book, along with the dialogue, is absolutely awful. I can handle that, as long as the actual sex is hot, but I felt those scenes left much to be desired, with the exception of the first one. The actual BSDM, is tame compared to other erotica I have read. Erotica is fiction, but when the characters are put into a modern, everyday setting, I find it incredibly hard to believe a college graduate has never even masturbated.  The notion of it is so distracting, it completely took me out of the story. Ana's conflicted feelings and tears over a BSDM relationship is what bothered me the most and left me unable to enjoy the story. Ana wants to have a traditional relationship without the BSDM aspect, but seems to go along with it because she has fallen in love with Christian. That type of relationship, whether it is onlymwritten in books or in real life, is based off of a mutual want of that type of relationship. How Christian pushes Ana into it doesn't float my boat. The way he dominates her outside of the sexual aspect is something I didn't enjoy. Women who are sexually submissive, does not mean they enjoy being submissive in other aspects of their life, even to the person they are submitting to sexually. Perhaps if this had not been in modern times, I would have liked it more, due to suspension of belief being greater.<br />Fifty Shades of Grey is completely the Twilight of erotica. It is poorly written, over-hyped,and is only enjoyed by people who rarely read erotica, or read in general. Like Twilight, it also features a heroine who had no self-esteem until she meets the hero, who also believes it okay to stalk her. For anyone who enjoys erotica, skip this one.
B005LA3Z9M|5.0|Wow, what a story. Super writing, intertwining two stories of the central character at different stages of her life. A friend had told me about this book and I was worried that it may be aimed at a female audience but i found it compelling and appealing. At times you will be frustrated but, in the end, the fact that the characters are all flawed makes it more believable and interesting. Treat yourself and buy this book, settle down, relax and enjoy. You won't regret it.
B004XWLN20|5.0|Very excellent show!  It is a must-see for anyone interested in comics or Superman.  It is great from the beginning and only gets better with each successive season.
B001FB4W0W|1.0|I have read ALL of the Sookie Stackhouse books. I really ENJOYED them. I literally CAN NOT read them fast enough! There is a good balance of action, comedy, love, tradgedy, suspense and the characters are really developed throughout the series. You grow to love them all in there own way. I enjoyed the books so much, I got True Blood! I started to watched the first season on DVD (with my teen...SO NOT FOR KIDS/TEENS)and I did no going into it that ANY HBO show, would have more sex, violence and \\"strong language\\". BUT OMG OMG OMG this just goes WAY beyond anything. I could NOT believe all the sex! Not nice sex, BUT porn sex...like really BAD PORN SEX! My kid DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT and I didn't either. I RETURNED IT! If I had watched this show on HBO, I would NEVER have purchased IT OR ANY OF THE BOOKS AT ALL!! I do realize that movies and shows are NEVER the same. BUT usually they are at least likeable and kinda like there books. HBO has managed to turn really awesome books, into really cheap daytime porn! And the acting couldn't be any worse if they tried!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I read the book summary, I wasn't sure if this book was really for me. It sounded a bit too science fiction for my normal tastes. I decided to give it a try anyway and was completely blown away. I couldn't put it down, and when I absolutely had to stop reading (life does intrude on precious reading time) I couldn't stop thinking about my new character friends. I was completely drawn into this new world created and couldn't wait to get back to it. I devoured it in no time, and immediatly started to second.<br />Katniss is a real heroine, and her struggle draws you in completely as you take every step with her and fight to keep her alive in the games. I found myself shouting out loud at the characters as events turned and the suspense heightened. I flew through the pages and felt an adrenaline rush through all the twists and turns of every challenge that Katniss endured. I cheered with every victory and was nearly in tears with every loss. (My Husband was very puzzled and thought I had lost my mind).<br />I was completely sucked into a world where 12 districts most on the brink of starvation, were forced to sacrifice their children year after year for the entertainment of the capital. Like fights between the gladiators in ancient Rome, 24 contestants all under than age of 18 and forced to fight to the death until only one tribute remains. The viewers from the capital watch anxiously awaiting each bloodbath relishing in the violence of each kill, completely desensitized to the fact that these are real children dying. Most of these kids have never weilded a weapon, and instead have spent their entire lives working to provide foods and goods for the capital. And now they have to fight for survival all with the hope that if they indeed win, the will be able to provide food for their starving district for a year. Katniss is not your normal damsel in distress just waiting for the hot boy to fall in love with her then come save her. She is strong and talented and actually does much of the saving herself. She is opinionated, and stands up for herself in a world where such definace is completely forbidden. She is the kind of character you love and want to relate to. You want her to succeed, although it is obvious that her chances of that are impossible.<br />This book combines love, heartbreak, action, suspense, and surprises around every page. It is a story unlike any other out there. It turned all of my preconcieved notions about YA books completely upside down. I was addicted from the very beginning, and my addiction did not stop until I had finished the trilogy!  Absolutely amazing.ly does much of the saving herself.

B0072GPQNG|5.0|Steven Spielberg is a grade above most contemporary directors because he keeps his priorities right, on the story and relationships. I hardly ever see movies in theaters today because most of them are crass and confusingly edited. This movie's cinematography (by Janusz Kaminski) is rich and creative, and close-ups are used effectively to help you bond with the characters. John Williams' music is once again enriching. It is a movie about the adventures of a horse in World War I, but it's even more about the struggle to adapt and maintain stable relationships in war. The horse is, for some of the characters, their closest companion. Kind of like \\"Sarah, Plain and Tall: Winter's End\\", War Horse's theme is about the need to build relationships as the fragility of life is impressed upon us. In fact, at one point, the horse brings together the opposing sides in friendship in the \\"no man's land\\" between the trenches, reminiscent of the widespread real-life Christmas Truce which occurred in 1914. Another thing that impresses me is the way it shows violence. There's no blood on the whole movie that I saw, and powerful emotions of fear and relief are created through making you feel attached to the characters, not through graphic violence. As a John Ford aficionado, I could see Ford's influence in Spielberg's storytelling, with the camera angle and position sometimes depicting an emotional closeness with the land and an ending told without words, like the end of Ford's movie The Searchers. It left me with a wonderful feeling at the end of satisfaction and peace. Way to go, Steven Spielberg!

B001SGEUNI|3.0|I'll cut right to the chase : band and lyrics sound like every other \\"modern rock\\" band today, aside from a passable sounding hot female singer. Anybody remember the 80's? Lita Ford was the best female metal artist because she had no competition. Same thing here. Put 40 pounds on her and let's see what happens. I know the little girls feel empowered listening to a female rock singer, but Pat Benatar LZZY is NOT!!! Deal with it kids, there's a reason the bands you liked 2 summers ago are long gone!

B005KELW26|1.0|Buyer beware. While it looked nice, this case is an overpriced piece of junk. It offers no  protection.  My Kindle was in the fully closed case when it slipped of a low coffee table and landed on a carpeted floor. The screen shattered from only a height of about 2 feet. This case is a worthless piece of junk. And due to it's poor design and lack of protection (and the Kindles flimsy construction), now too is my Kindle.<br /><br />Two of the Kindle's corners remain fully exposed to impact damage. Another serious design flaw, it's straps partially cover the Kindle Fire's speakers, deadening the sound. Not that that matters now... my Kindle isn't making any sounds.<br /><br />Extremely disappointed with this worthless case.<br /><br />So I payed $44 for this useless piece of junk. And now I have to pay another $100 to replace my Kindle. And another $40 for someone else's case that actually works to protect. So I'm out $487 and should have just bought an iPad which is far more durable and functional in the first place.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I didn't finish it as, well frankly, I couldn't.  I'll break it down easy for you from a guys point of view.<br /><br />Some good point:<br />  -  It's like reading a porno.<br /><br />Some bad points:<br /> - Poor paragraph formating makes it hard to distinguish who's saying what at times.<br /> - Ana becomes dominate because it's seems convenient for the author, as their is no reason or precedent for it (I thought this was supposed to be MALE-dom).  From \\"You want to?  Ok, sure!\\" to \\"I want romance.  Give it to me.\\"<br /> - Mr. Grey's dominance and manliness changes like a hamster in a ball.<br /> - Everything was dictated \\"He did this, I did that, it made me do that, which made him do that.\\"  Seriously, where's the emotion, the passion.<br /> - The book didn't hold any stable ground; sometimes like an erotica and other times like a chick flick.  Nothing wrong with chick flicks, but pick a direction and stick to it.<br /><br />So anyway, to sum it up - great porno, lame plot.

B001974DG0|4.0|Please note that this review is specifically about the Kindle edition, and not other editions.  This is pretty important because some of the problems that exist in the Kindle edition are irrelevant to print editions.<br /><br />This is a book that I read ages ago, loved a great deal, and was eager to buy again in electronic form after my paperback copy inexplicably disappeared.  In terms of its writing, it is every bit as excellent as I remember, and still an enjoyable read.  It IS a little bit dated at this point; written in 1987 at the end of the Cold War, it features a number of references to that and to Soviet espionage that might not elicit quite the same responses in contemporary readers as were intended at the time.  Some of the speculations about technology, genetic engineering, and its impact on human society are dated as well, since the last 25 years have actually demonstrated how such things would or wouldn't play out in the real world.  However, these are things that are easy to get around, and may actually add some interesting dimensions for new readers of the book since their inclusion can give those readers a glimpse into the dreams and anxieties of a previous generation.  The heart of the story is still as strong as ever, and still very moving.<br /><br />The Kindle edition, however, needs some work.  The most egregious problem with it is the lack of the advertised cover, which is nowhere on the edition when you open it up!  As it's a really lovely cover, I was looking forward to seeing it on the virtual \\"bookshelf\\" and its lack is very annoying.  Don't show it if you're not selling it, Amazon!  There are also several typos that make it pretty clear that whoever proofread the edition fell asleep at the wheel a few times.  Most of them, weirdly enough, are run-together words (almost always italicized) that ought to have been caught and corrected by even the most rudimentary spell-check program, so I have no idea why they weren't.  (If you think the word \\"loided\\" is a typo, however, you would be wrong.)  Hopefully publishers will start taking eBook editions seriously in the future, and actually put more care into producing them, and these kinds of mistakes will stop.  But as long as you don't mind the drab, crappy cover in place of the pretty one that was advertised, and aren't yanked out of the narrative by the occasional inept typesetting, you'll be just fine.rd \\"loided\\" is a typo, however, you would be wrong.)

B0007TKNII|3.0|I had seen this movie a while back, and wasn't crazy about it.  After watching the 25th anniversary production, I thought I'd give it another chance.  Not the best choice.  The look is spectacular, sets and costumes are great, but I wish that they had done a better job in casting.  The Phantom, Christine, and Rauol had good voices, but definitely not great, and these rolls call for Great Voices.  Couldn't they have chosen any one of the many actors and actresses who have played the roles on stage?  And I just didn't get the huge fascination that the Phantom and Rauol have for Christine - very little chemistry between any of them.  Emmy Rossum is lovely to look at, but I'm pretty sure that they had to do a new camera shot every time she had to change emotions or expressions (half of which seemed to involve her mouth hanging open like a fish, expecially in Past the Point of No Return).  The Phantom's makeup just wasn't frightening at all, no where near the really horrific makeup in the musical.  And why, after both of his eyes being dark for most of the movie, did his right eye turn pale blue after Christine ripped his mask off?<br />The supporting cast did a great job (Minnie Driver was a bit over the top, but she was a diva, after all).  But they did a disservice to the musical by not casting the three principals better (and hey, I actually do like Patrick Wilson, just not in this role).
1250006341|5.0|Lovely book; full of pictures and explanations of Edwardian life on an estate.  Very helpful if there's a detail or two someone missed while watching the series.
B007JRUCGO|3.0|This movie has a STELLAR voice cast that kind of fell short.  It reminds me of the disaster movies o the 80's that always had the all-star cast and yet always seemed to fall drastically short.  My daughter who is 3, LOVES penguins and she adored the first movie, but this one wouldn't hold her attention for more than 5 minutes the whole way through.  I wasn't altogether impressed with it myself, but to be fair, I wasn't altogether impressed with the first one either.  I will say this however: The human animation was really good, especially when they are on the deck playing the guitar to Lovelace.  As a matter of fact, I really had no problem with any of the animation.<br />I was mildly annoyed at the fact that Mumble is still sporting his half baby fluff, even though he is a father now.  That is both lame and in very poor taste because the message is either that he has Peter Pan syndrome and is refusing to grow up, or that he is still an adolescent that is now a parent... neither of which is a message I like for kids.<br />I'm also not thrilled with the deception of the Puffin and there being no consequences for the lying and manipulation other than his self-imposed momentary isolation.<br />Then the elephant seal, who goes from being an honorable and loving father to one who seems as treacherous as the sea lion.  Moodiness and crankiness is one thing, but that was a complete personality shift.<br />The only really fun thing was the journey of self-discovery by the krill... and the possibly gay overtones therein were mildly amusing.<br />The talent involved in this deserved a well-written script and not this one.  It felt a little like a last-minute paper, written by a frat boy after a beer bust.
0385512104|4.0|I just finished reading The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. It's a novel written from the perspective of a 15 year old autistic (the book never mentions his exact disability, though) boy, Christopher. The book takes it's title from a Sherlock Holmes quote and begins with Christopher trying to investigate the killing of a neighbor's dog. It's exceedingly easy to read since Christopher speaks in short declarative sentences. It's also very short.<br /><br />The two most interesting aspects of the book, and why I would recommend it are: one, halfway through, the novel takes a much more somber tone while confronting relatively commonplace issues. It's interesting being a reader able to understand the emotional aspects of the events of the book, but following the perspective of a kid who's unable to emotionally connect with most of what's happening. Second, I generally think a book is a much better medium to tell a story about the mentally disabled since you're able to get more information about a person's subconscious thought (unless a film is willing to rely upon heavy narration, blegh). But, unlike say Flowers for Algernon, this book isn't so much about mental illness as this particular family, their problems, and how Christopher relates to it.

0691142165|4.0|I've just finished reading This Time Is Different. I should say I `finished' reading about two thirds of the book as I skimmed or skipped the most technical portions. The book, as per its subtitle: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly, bills itself as comprehensive look at sixty six countries and their financial crises over almost all of the last millennia. Either due to its marketing or my presumptions, I thought the book would be a narrative of pithy coverage of financial crises. Rather, the book is quite technical with numerous charts, graphs, and economic analysis; the first 50 pages are devoted solely to setting up the financial rubric the book will use to analyze its data points. As such, I don't recommend the book for anyone looking for a financial history, or something like The Big Short or The Lords of Finance (as I was). If you're looking for a technical, yet mostly approachable from a lay perspective, analysis of financial crises and how they relate to today, it's great.<br /><br />Despite my misgivings, I do think the most valuable portion of the book (for me) was the last section which accumulated the information from past experience and applied it to the Great Recession. The book came out in 2009, so it doesn't have a great deal of information about how the late-2000s crisis turned out. Yet, the book does have a good deal of information about other major banking crises and how they ended. Obviously, this type of information is quite timely. And on this account, the current situation doesn't seem so bad, and there are signs for optimism. Major banking crises, apparently, typically raise unemployment by 7% and unemployment grows for 4.8 years, on average. The US unemployment rate (U1) rose from around 4% to 10%, about average, but unemployment has grown for only around two years. Much of this is probably due to systemic causes, but it does undercut almost all of the standard Republican-party economic voodoo, and the deranged `expansionary austerity' that has hurt much of Europe. There's a lot of analysis like this, and with a lot of the recent good economic news, it's interesting to see how that stacks up compared with past crises.<br /><br />The book's most valuable message conveys is broader than just a technical comparison of the present with the past, but is apparent from the book's title: the past does repeat itself, and did so in 2007. The Great Recession was unique in certain ways, but followed a very particular pattern and carried numerous warning signs. Yet, as with many historical crises, the people in positions of power, contrary to a lot of the demonizing rhetoric heaped upon banks, regulators, politicians, etc., seem to have disregarded this history, took up the kool-aid, and really believed that this time was different.  Yet, this time wasn't different, and it's folly to expect that in the future, that time will be anything but the same.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I really enjoyed this Emma. The music, especially, is spectacular. We'd love to get the sheet music for this.<br /><br />I appreciated the little extras the movie shows from the childhoods of the three children. They added some extra insight into the lives of the three. We also get more of a feeling of Mr. Knightly schooling Emma than other renditions.<br /><br />This was a delightful rendition, although my daughters think Mr. Knightly is too short and young-looking. I love how he's portrayed. And Romola Gerai does a smashing job as Emma.

Sure, Dave loosing his voice, sure the harmonies are missing Mike, sure Eddie is repeating himself (arguably that has been the case for years). None that means this album is bad, it is actually quite good, with some great songs and riffs on it.

B004DI7HZ6|2.0|This book starts out great, it is smartly written and the main female protagonist seems like she would be compelling. However, as soon as she meets the character that is clearly going to be her romantic counter part(sexy vampire Matthew Clairmont), it quickly dissolves into what can only be described as a predictable, repetitive romance novel. The main female character loses all sense of herself, and it only becomes about her relationship with the vampire. I was so disappointed in this book because it started with so much potential. When it got to be the 6th chapter straight of simply the main character and the vampire's relationship (he takes her home and they \\"get to know each other\\" for about 100 pages) I gave up and couldn't even finish. Romance novels are fine if they are advertised as such, but the book starts off making the readers think that the book will revolve around adventure, discovery and super natural creatures with cool powers. Not to mention a smart and capable main female character whose passion is her career, not a relationship. All of that quickly dissolves by the 5th chapter. Again, I couldn't finish so maybe the end salvages itself, but there are too many good books out there to waste time on this one (unless you are looking for a romance novel, in which case, have at it!)

0385720920|4.0|Choke is an interesting (if slightly derivative) take on addiction, art, and heros.  There are many similar elements to Fight Club, but you get the other side of Fight Club's philosophy.  Choke delves into the very basics of human desire, the want to be loved, to be remembered, to be a hero.<br /><br />One of the things that draws me to Mr. P's work, time and time again, is the fact that at some point in the novel, you get these little gems of insight on society, or philosophy at large.  One of my favorites in this novel is this: \\"The unreal is more powerful than the real. Because nothing is as perfect as you can imagine it. Because it's only intangibles, ideas, concepts, beliefs, fantasies that last. Stone crumbles. Wood rots. People, well, they die. But things as fragile as a thought, a dream, a legend, they can go on and on. If you can change the way people think. The way they see themselves. The way they see the world. You can change the way people live their lives. That's the only lasting thing you can create.\\"<br /><br />If you ask a fan of Chuck Palahniuk's work what his or her favorite book is by Mr. P, Choke will often be at the top of the list (or near the top).  I agree that it should be close to the top, but, in my opinion, it is not his best work.  (Although 'Choke' is representative of the period in Mr. P's work, where the writing is still fairly cohesive and the originality is in the substance, rather than the execution.)

B005GVF95O|4.0|My 2-year-old loves this app! She really enjoys the cute animals. Since the variety is quite limited, it's great for her now when she doesn't mind doing the same puzzles over and over again, but she'll probably start getting tired of it when she's a little older. My 5-year-old did a couple of puzzles and decided that he wasn't interested anymore because it's too easy.<br /><br />At $1.99, this app is too expensive for the limited time it will be used and for the limited amount of puzzles (reason for the 4 stars instead of 5). Since I got it as the FAotD, though, I think it's great. If you have a very young child (probably 1 1/2 to 3 years old) and if they drop the price to 99 cents or add more puzzles then I would recommend buying this app.<br /><br />The app works without any problems on my Samsung Galaxy Spica.

But Cinder, is so not your classic fairytale. I love how Meyer reinvents the story Cinderella with such wonderful twists! She takes all the main points that everyone knows and tweaks them into a fabulous new story - which for our day and age is a million times better. It is still a fairytale in my mind - but so much more. It's drama, it's sci-fi, it's paranormal!!<br /><br />Cinder isn't just a young girl enslaved by a hateful stepmother and her two daughters. She is also a cyborg. A member of a minority of people who have had parts of their body replaced with cyber engineered parts. She suffered an accident when she was very young and was saved by these advanced in medical technology. Unfortunately, this minority is treated rather harshly by the rest of the populace. This is a futuristic Earth, based on the year in the book, at least over a hundred years into the future. The world has warred, changed, Nations have been combined and some cease to exist. Technology has advanced such that we have hover cars, AI robots and a lot more. So with that we are given a sci-fi aspect to the story.<br /><br />Cinder lives in the Eastern Commonwealth which appears to be the bulk of all the former Asian countries combined. There are still politicians and nobility, doubt the world will ever get away from that - Plus we needed our prince now didn't we? So perhaps there will be a bit of romantic feelings developed? I'm not telling - but the interactions and acquaintance formed between Cinder and Prince Kai (Prince of the Eastern Commonwealth) - are interesting. Both Cinder and Prince Kai's characters were fleshed out so well that I didn't feel like there were any wasted pages what so ever. Often, I find that supporting lead characters are never done quite so well as the main protagonist. Not so here.<br /><br />The descriptions in this book are perfectly executed in my mind. Particularly, I enjoyed the description of the market. I could feel the masses of people going about their business, hawking their wares, rushing here and there. I still got that sense of a busy street market like we have today in Asian countries, but also filled with a lot of technology. Meyer really made it a point to add nuances of several different Asian cultures into the Eastern Commonwealth and I thought she blended them so nicely.<br /><br />Now to add some more drama to he mix - there happens to be a very nasty plague that has been afflicting the inhabitants of Earth for some number of years. Her adopted father was stricken with this illness right after she was taken in some 10 or so years ago. Others close to her, (who shall remain nameless - no spoilers allowed) are also afflicted. The incubation of the illness and subsequent death of the patient is very short - usually a matter of days. Currently, there is no vaccine or cure. This to me is the gritty realism needed in a great tale.<br /><br />Lastly, where does she get that title for the series? - The Lunar Chronicles? Why because there are people that live on the moon! Descendants of Earth that colonized the Moon long ago and who have evolved to have unique paranormal abilities. I won't go into it too much here - but they are a very key element to this tale.<br /><br />And don't worry folks, we still have the pumpkin, glass slipper and godmother - you'll really enjoy their interpretations. So order it - it is so worth it! I've been foaming at the mouth to get my hands on the next book when I wasn't even halfway through this one.er and Prince Kai's characters were fleshed out so well that I didn't feel like there were any wasted pages what so ever.

B004L07KWQ|5.0|While it's fun to play around with for a few minutes for adults, this program is amazing for young kids. The simplicity would probably make it less interesting for anyone over 5 years old, but my 2-year-old loves to draw on this.<br /><br />My favorite feature of the program is the ability to take a picture of what your kid drew. Those make for great wallpapers/screensavers and they're great to show off your kids budding talent. :)<br /><br />The program has no problems at all on my Samsung Galaxy Spica.
B0014DQSG2|5.0|Excellent movie!  First time seeing movie starring Amanda Bynes. I really enjoyed her role. Loved Colin Firth's role. It was an excellent family movie.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|I enjoy tower defense games in general, but this game is my favorite. The gameplay is fun. The difficulty is challenging but not impossible (it's also variable). The graphics are nice. Each weapon (and there are quite a few) actually does have different advantages and disadvantages (some tower defense games have weapons with different names that are nearly identical in practical use or they just don't have many weapons at all).<br /><br />I'm using it on a Samsung Galaxy Spica and it works great! I can't wait to get a tablet to take better advantage of the HD graphics.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|Given the price of this item, I had my doubts but I ordered it based on the positive reviews here. I'm impressed! Tested with several pair of my high-end headphones from Sennheiser, Grado, and AKG, it drove them all to perfectly acceptable volume levels without discernible distortion. There is no detectable noise from this amplifier at all!<br /><br />For those who were disappointed that it didn't improve \\"sound quality,\\" you're expecting the impossible. This is an analog amplifier -- what comes out cannot possibly be of higher quality than what goes in. What's important, though, is that to my trained ear (I am an audio engineer) there is no detectable degradation.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Tons of games! Even though most of the games in this pack are too short/easy, there are enough of them that are challenging or that have a lot of replay value to make it worth downloading. The way the game is setup so that you have to score points to unlock new games keeps you playing just so you can see what the next game is. Though there are a few repeats (same basic game, but different theme), I was surprised at the variety that's included.<br /><br />The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that 101 games is not entirely true because of the repeats I mentioned above. Also, the point requirements are a little too high once you get past the first screen of games. You end up having to replay games too much just so you can unlock the next game.<br /><br />I have a Samsung Galaxy Spica and this works great on it.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|I loved this movie! I'm really glad it finally got made. I had low expectations, but John Carter was quite fun and honored the books and ERB. I'm hoping for a sequel.
B0064BCNA4|3.0|My phone (Samsung Galaxy Spica) isn't a fast phone by any means and that's probably why the sound lags quite a bit behind the key presses. I also couldn't get any chords to work even though my phone supports at least 2 point multi-touch in other apps.<br /><br />Luckily for me, I never thought that I would actually play the piano on my small cell phone screen. I got the app for two reasons: 1) It was the FAotD and 2) I like being able to look at printed music and play a couple of notes just to get the tune in my head. At church I often forget the tune of songs that aren't sung much, so I can look in the hymnbook, play the first few notes, and get on track before the congregation starts singing instead of catching up a couple measures into the song.<br /><br />Hopefully when I get a new phone, the lag and multi-touch issues will disappear. Other than that, it would also be nice to get an actual tablet version of this app with more keys.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|This is one of the greatest concerts ever!  Frusciante is in his element during the show. Backing vocals and guitar solos are spectacular! RHCP has a ton of energy for this show and you can tell they are having a great time. Every song on this dvd is awesome!
B005J0VPNC|4.0|This app is more of a novelty than anything else. I'm glad I got it as the FAotD a while back since I definitely would not have paid $1.99 for it. But then that's just me. I'm sure that there are lots of people that would use this app all the time. I think the effects that this app applies to photos are pretty cool, but my whole reason for taking photos is to record memories. Because of that, I prefer regular photos or less invasive effects.<br /><br />It was definitely fun to play around with for a few minutes and for what it's trying to do, it does it quite well. I see no need to drastically mark down a good app just because it's not my favorite.<br /><br />The basic features (not including video recording, of course) work fine on my older Samsung Galaxy Spica.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I am and continue to be a fan of the original game, but the port is definitely lackluster. Experiencing freezes, game failures, and save issues on my Galaxy Nexus with ICS. The gameplay is relatively identical to the original...or at least it might be. Won't know until I can actually finish a level without an issue.
B0058VW36U|5.0|After hearing all the hype about this game, I was ready to be disappointed, but it really is as good as everyone says! It's simple to pick up (even my 2-year-old can get the basics down), but after a few levels it starts getting more difficult. Once you think you've mastered the game, they introduce a new twist and you have to start over with failing a level a few times before getting the hang of it again. Keeps it interesting!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this game to anyone.<br /><br />Working great on a Samsung Galaxy Spica.
B00005QATY|3.0|I ordered this thinking it was DVD I did not take time to notice this.  I did get it fast it was in great shape.  Although I do not have a VHS anymore I will keep it and let other watch it.
B000FBJAOG|4.0|Pretty good book on all things zombie related. To the uninitiated,it may seem farsical,but both FEMA and the CDC acknowledge zombies are indeed a real threat.The historical accounts of zombie phenomena are particularly interesting.
B007BDK3SS|1.0|I clicked download app and it said downloading but wasn't filling up with green so I am not able to get this app which is unfortunate thank you
B0052UZIFA|1.0|you can't play it on a galaxy nexus! it freezes almost instantly and the only way to clear it up is to force stop it in apps. ridiculous for a game that I paid for!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Awesome game, very polished. The puzzles are challenging and rewarding.  One of my favorites. I only wish the yo was slightly.more.polished in regards to navigating the levels
086571701X|3.0|Below is my original review. Based on the author's comment that I overlooked the step by step info I read the book more thoroughly.<br />I did learn more, but I feel comfortable that my rating and review are reflect my experience with the book. I learned more diligently reading out of guilt since I offended the author than I did the first time trying to pinpoint topics that interested me using the table of contents and index. In part, my review of the book may be because I am living in a small space, I have a budget, I have no hydroponic nor aquaponic experience and little gardening experience, and my interest in not for a hobby but to see if I can actually create healthy food sustainably. My beginner's level and tight budget made this book feel like a poor match for me.<br /><br />The book should be titled \\"An introduction to the wonderful world of Aquaponics\\"<br />What the book does do:<br /><br />Share lots of tidbits, anecdotes, enthusiasm, and resources/people from the online and international aquaponics community<br /><br />Help guide a committed aquaponics individual through a host of philosophical decisions about space, aethestics, types of systems, types of lighting. Often these are explained well so that you understand why the recommendation is being made. But there are no samples, photos, lists, cost and time estimates, nor step by step instructions for aquiring, installing, etc.<br />For example: the author suggests one possible container to use is called an IBC tote (pg 80) and then advises one to \\"be sure to test your tote grow beds for leaks before adding media, and seal any problem areas with marine-grade silicone.\\"<br />(but at this stage in teh reading I still didn't know what media was and sealing with silicone didn't connect at all to what I know currently about gardening so I assumed if I wanted to do this I would need to search the internet for a STEP BY STEP guide)<br /><br />Describe choices of media well.<br /><br />Describe basic variationsof systems well.<br /><br />Describe thoroughly what the author terms the \\"rules of Thumb\\" for aquaponics.<br />These general guidelines are explained so you understand why you should heed the advice.<br /><br />WHAT THIS BOOK DOES NOT DO:<br />Give any estimates on time or expense. I came away from most of my reading, despite the authors encouragement, feeling that this was for someone who had a lot of time to commit to this, was interested as a well-loved hobby (though she points out ways to decrease unpleasant chores and make things run smoothly on their own), and someone with a lot of money to invest (my ballpark after reading and having never owned a large aquarium was 5-10grand easy if you actually want it to work well), and someone who didn't care if the system paid for itself within a few years.<br /><br />Give any checklists, shopping lists, \\"questions to ask your supplier\\" lists, etc.<br />In traditional gardening books I find this info often and it is usually quite handy<br /><br />Give any step by step photos<br />MOst photos show elaborate set ups and about 1/3 show close ups of nature that could be from any gardening book<br /><br />Give step by step installation instructions:<br />I was imagining instructions like one might find in a cook book or repair manual with each step laid out for getting me started, but the steps in this book are more \\"rules of thumb\\" that help you navigate the decision making process. There is little example nor practical details shared that help me build something over a weekend to try out the idea. If the author were to assume that some readers philosophical answer would be \\"I want the cheapest easiest system so I can start a project and be rolling by the end of a long weekend\\" I think a step by step guide on how to govern that project would be extremely helpful.<br /><br />After reading, I found more info of the sort I was seeking from the internet. I can see that the book has some helpful info if you chose a media systemvs. the other types (which are explained somewhat in the book), and if you are willing to do the cost/supply/how to research yourself and use this book to help you organize your endeavor.<br />I don't find this book is helpful if you are trying to find a small simple way to get started and you want detailed step by step instructions (like one might find in a cookbook), some guidance on costs, yields, and a collection of specific examples in photos or text that help you envision how people on budgets/small spaces made this work for them.<br />So should you buy this book? Well, as the author says on p.55 in her conclusion of the \\"The Plan\\"<br />\\"Can you afford a greenhouse?\\"<br />-----------------------<br />My original review below:<br /><br />I overlooked the typos on the first page of the introduction and read the first chapter. Skimming the book, I felt like I was listening in on the inside jokes from Aqua-zealots at a convention. The writing is sometimes well worded and personable. I found little info in the chapters I read that helped me understand concretely what it means to BEGIN setting up a system like this. The author claims a criticism from a newbie that he needed \\" a clear way to begin\\" was why she wrote the book. It's why I bought the book, but I'm sending it back.<br /><br />I flipped to the pictures pages to get a handle on what is possible, there are only 4 color phots pages in the book, so why have so many pics been used to show the author and her dog and close-ups of a pepper plant. Next I tried the table of contents to hone in on some specifics. The section on \\"harvesting fish\\" didn't have any info that let me know how often you could harvest, nor what type of financial investment would lead to what sort of yield. INstead it is one single paragraph that says the author might not kill her fish after all and if you do you can use ice water to shock them dead. This is far from a Step by Step guide. It's more an elaborate magazine article full of cameos, shout-outs from and to the Aquaponic devout.<br /><br />It might be a resource I would use once I was established, I can't judge that since I'm not established. I suspect, however, that with a good deal of experience this book would become unneccessary. But without Aquaponics experience, this book lacks background info, organization, enough images, and (despite the title) step by step instructions to be helpful for someone considering or beginning to try this form of gardening. Too bad. I wanted to love this book.
0439023521|5.0|SEMI-SPOILERS CONTAINED HEREIN! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!<br /><br />This is the story of Katniss Everdeen. She lives in a new world called Panem that was created from the ashes of the former continent of North America. Due to a rebellion that once happened in Panem, the country's government has decided to punish the people by forcing the 12 remaining districts to offer up \\"tribute\\" one male and female between the ages of 12 and 18 for the annual \\"Hunger Games\\" which is an arena battle to the death. The boy tribute from District 12 is Peeta Mellark.<br /><br />At the very beginning of the story, Katniss was not supposed to be tribute. Her sister, who is in the drawing for the first time, with only one slip in there gets picked. Katniss, who cannot bear to see her sister go, volunteers as tribute. The rest of the story follows the journey to the Hunger Games, and the Hunger Games themselves.<br /><br />A romance seems to begin to blossom between Peeta and Katniss, and the Gamemakers even announce that a new rule was introduced, and that if the male and female pair from any give district is still in the games, they will both be able to be crowned Victors. At the end however, the Gamemakers renounce this rule, hoping for a massively amazing ending. Katniss comes up with a plan to thwart them however, and therefore she and Peeta are both named Victor.<br /><br />Now there is massive danger for Katniss and Peeta since the government is not happy with this fit of rebellion. Katniss is going to have to start watching her every move and thought and word in hopes that she does not provoke the government into taking action against her. This is where book one leaves off, and I almost screamed in frustration. I will not be able to get book two for a little while, and I'm itching to read it.<br /><br />All in all this book is amazing. It was super hard to put down, and I hung on to every word. It's packed with action, and a little bit of romance, and it's just an all around amazing book. I think that everyone needs to read this book at least once in their lives, and it will in truth teach you a little bit about yourself that you may have not known.g book.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The hunger games is a book that will keep you up all night either reading or thinking about it. It is a good book for many different reading likes. It has a touch of romance but not sappy at all. The plot is a future country of modern day America in major poverty except the capitol and of course there favorite districts 1 2 and 4.In order to keep all the districts in line they have to participate in the hunger games which is when every district has to send 1 boy and 1 girl into an arena where there is a fight to the death to win anyway possible but it isn't for all readers if you don't like gory things.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|Thank you so much for this app.  It is the best! What a steal for $0.99!! It is very helpful and doesn't take much time to load.  I would recommend this app to anyone who wants to be more knowledgeable.

B006OCM0G0|4.0|Great fun.  Frequent updates.  Worth a try for &quot;story&quot; and &quot;ville&quot; fans.  The only downside is the cost of in-game items.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I think I need to play it more to be sure that I review<br />the game correctly.  I would like something a little more<br />challenging.
B0055SWM08|5.0|lovely graphics and relaxing music go well with the challenging puzzles of this game. I love it! ibwould recommend this to anyone.

B0041D843M|5.0|I'll preface this by saying I am an oncology nurse and also had a quadruple bypass at the age of 43 when I was slim and appeared healthy. It is very sad that so many of our worst diseases are preventable. This book should be required reading at every nursing and medical school.Unfortunately our focus and health dollars are directed towards \\"curing\\" or treating people with disease rather than working to prevent it in the first place. It is analogous to the old Fram oil filter commercials. You can pay me now or you can pay me later. So much cheaper to prevent rather than repair. And so much less painful for the patient, their families and friends.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for anyone concerned about their and their families health. It requires lifestyle change but is quite easy to accomplish. It will both enhance your life and save you money. Just be willing to change old habits.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|if you're looking for a time waster then this is your game. you have to earn points to unlock new games and sometimes that gets annoying but overall not bad. fun to play.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I give it 4 stars only because it was so short.  The time I spent playing was great entertainment and very challenging.
B0072X2NUS|5.0|While many modern electronic dj's attempt to jump to dubsteb, Vince and Martin team up to bring the electronic world a fresh look at the trance roots. Instead of slapping you with a wall of sound and cloned loops, Vince's genius with the synth's brings you complex yet clean and clear trance music.<br /><br />As a coder, I've found that if you just put this in a gapless playback, and a loop, it'll get you through a day of deep coding well.<br /><br />Most excited to see what remixes come from this. Great material for samples for sure.

B005U3V7MC|3.0|P.D. James tried and largely failed to capture the essence of Jane Austen in Death Comes to Pemberley. The names are the same, the location is the same, but the insight into character, the dialogue and the plot development fail to hit the mark. You may enjoy the book anyway because of some of the staging and details, but the Austen spirit isn't there.<br /><br />The only death that's come to Pemberley is the idea that someone else can write like Jane Austen.

B000000YG5|5.0|During the mid 1950's the jazz genre was entering into a very different place. Not too long ago America's most popular music,it lost some of that public gained in the transition from swing to be-bop. There was brilliant music made. But not everyone wanted to hear it. With all the creative energy in the music splitting off in different directions after WW2,jazz wasn't just jazz anymore. There were all these new and different styles of the music:swing,be-bop,Dixieland,modal. And as time passed many many more. So it seemed any new musician who came along would be required to do something extremely daring and extremely original to \\"stay fresh\\". Coming straight from the be-bop era and playing with Miles Davis's early bands Sonny Rollins didn't seem incredibly worried about any of this. As a person whose interest in playing seemed to be more significant sometimes than his ego Sonny didn't seem as concerned on this album about any of that. Just about good playing.<br /><br />  Perhaps it had something to do with Sonny's mild distrust of the recording studio belief that jazz came off more fully in live performance that one of the things that makes this album so interest is how much Sonny holds back from hogging major solo space. Also he's not a flamboyant improviser either. Of course this album is known by a lot of people by it's opener \\"St.Thomas\\",one of the most memorable melodies in jazz at the time with it's shuffling salsa rhythms and Sonny's clever invention of melody. \\"Strode Rode\\" is one of the few numbers on here where Sonny also solos a lot. On the final two numbers something very different happens. \\"Moritat\\" (more commonly known as \\"Mack The Knife\\") and at this time commonly associated with Louis Armstrong  has Rollins really only playing the melody while he pretty much lets Max Roach's flamboyant drum soloing and pianist Tommy Flanagan hold the floor the majority of the time. And why not? They are of course tremendous players. The same thing happens on the slower blues based numbers \\"You Don't Know What Love Is\\" and \\"Blue Seven\\".<br /><br />  So in the end does this album open up any major new artistic territory for jazz?No it really doesn't. What it does do is find a quartet of some of jazz's most talented players of the time in Rollins,Flanagan,Max Roach and Doug Watkins on bass just doing basically the sort of musical set they might do while in performance. So in a way this could be seen more as an in the studio concert rather than a strictly studio based session. Of course almost all jazz at this time was recording this way with no overdubbing. And even though this is by no means a live album,something about the way the sound was captured really put a lot of emphasis on the the way Sonny Rollins presented his music. Sometimes a musicians approach to their sound,as opposed to the WAY they play is the most significant aspect of their talents. And I would have to say that about Sonny Rollins. He plays wonderfully,melodically and crisply with a great sense of bounce and swing to his sound as well. And that to me might be why this album is so beloved by so many jazz fans from all over.r blues based numbers \\"You Don't Know What Love Is\\" and \\"Blue Seven\\".<br /><br />  So in the end does this album open up any major new artistic territory for jazz?No it really doesn't.

I know it is not an issue with the seller, I have nothing against them in fact the were great in handling the issue it is a problem with the mass produced copies in my opinion.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|All I can say about this book is...hmm....where do I start?  There have to be an awful lot of women out there who have led very sheltered lives to think that THIS book is \\"too much.\\"  Christian mentions \\"vanilla sex\\"--this whole BOOK is vanilla sex!  I can't imagine how people are thinking this book is risque!  And Christian I could deal with, but Ana??  If she said \\"Oh my\\" one more time, I think I would have screamed.  As it was, I came close--and NOT from reading about the \\"sex\\".  How annoying!!  And to think she went from being a virgin to a sex maniac in a couple of weeks--that just doesn't fly. Also, I'm sure there are tons of women out there who now believe they should be having six orgasms every time they have sex.  Too funny. Needless to say, I will not be reading the second two books.  I'm sure this author is laughing all the way to the bank, but come on!  If you want to write something in this genre, at least make the heroine likable!!  And make it a little hotter, please!

They don't test their hybred wheat, no wonder Americans are dying of cancer, obesity, and multiple health issues. No more PB&Js for my kids! It may explain why our teenagers are having learning and behavioral problems.
B005HEKM20|3.0|This episode basically delves yet again into the classic storytelling premise of \\"if this one person weren't here, what would happen.\\" Unfortunately, we already know this, because they used it repeatedly in the silly time traveling episodes in season 1 and 2 with Daniels that Archer is super important to pretty much everything.<br /><br />This episode didn't really do much except drive another nail into that particular story point's coffin.

0439023513|2.0|On the one hand, the book is a pretty realistic portrayal of what war is like, and of the trauma suffered by someone who has been responsible for the death of hundreds if not thousands of people. For anyone who has ever been in the military or had family members in the military, this was probably a pretty powerful novel.<br /><br />However, need a book always be entirely realistic to be good? Certainly that does not hold true for video games; if one were to make a \\"realistic\\" war game, most of the time the player would be sitting in bunkers or in stakeouts. Nothing remotely enjoyable about that. Does Mockingjay really need to portray the hours and hours of characters sitting around doing nothing, waiting for news? I want to be entertained when I read a novel; having to read about a character pace a room for a whole chapter does nothing for me. I can understand that being necessary depending on the scene, and book, but I felt that in this case, the novel was robbed of too much action.<br /><br />Then there is the ending. The confusing, thrilling, and ultimately pathetic ending. One of my biggest issues is the death of Coin. Katniss' assasination of her is a very interesting twist in the story, and I quite liked it. But for a novel that strives to be so realistic, why does it fail to acknowledge just how destabilizing Coin's death would have been? How is that Katniss can kill the woman who led her people to freedom is allowed to get off on a mere \\"insanity\\" charge? If someone were to have murdered Toussaint L'Overture immediately following his conquest of Haiti, do you think people would have allowed for a lengthy trial and ultimate acquittal? It seems incredibly far-fetched to me.<br /><br />Then, there is Peeta, and the all-too-easy finale. So he suffers weeks and weeks of intense torture, and just magically improves and gets away with a few nightmares every now and then? I don't think Katniss should have ended up with him at all. Throughout the whole novel, Peeta was dedicated to protecting Katniss. He WANTED to die for her. His final act should have been to kill himself rather than let his madness consume him at some vital point in the story; that would have been a realistic, poignant ending to the story. But Collins wanted to give us a storybook ending.<br /><br />Last but not least; Katniss. Katniss who really doesn't change at all from the rest of the series, suddenly camera perfect and strong when she needs to be, weak whenever it suits the plot. And just as naive and hypocrital about death as always. The death of a civilian is intolerable, but squadrons of Peacekeepers having their heads ripped off is treated with no more respect than a rodent being run over by a car. The Peacekeepers are treated and described as being inhuman throughout the novel. Collins purposefully chooses to ignore the humanity of the soldiers, when they are just human as any of the civilians burned to death in District 12. They all have families too, sons, daughters, wives. They are no different than Katniss' dad yet they are slaughtered wholesale without a second thought. And yet Collins has the audacity to bemoan the civilian casualites of war.<br /><br />One of the things that irked me the most about the theme of war in Mockingjay is that Collins discredits everyone in the novel who made the rebellion possible. Were it not for the mercilessness of President Coin, and the discompassionate death traps of Gale and Beetee, they would not have won. As Gale said, they are playing by the same rule book as Snow; and it is for THAT REASON that they are able to defeat Snow. If Katniss had been allowed to lead the rebellion they would have all been squashed right from the beginning. And Coin is the one that helped 13 survive and make the revolution possible. Yet somehow she ends up the true villain.<br /><br />Collins makes a valid point in that war takes a heavy emotional toll. However, she still preaches a pathetic, hopeless idealism that revolution canbe achieved without innocent casualities, and to the desired effect. She tries to realistically portray war, but fails to grasp the notion that to win a war you HAVE to be willing to be as merciless as Gale. Unfortunately, Gale is used by Collins as a metaphor for war-mongerels, and is exiled into a vague, uninteresting ending. Collins makes no attempt to rationalize his behaviour, only calling it \\"rage\\" and \\"fire\\" and leaving it at that.<br /><br />Yet he cared for Katniss just as much as Peeta or anyone else. He endured months of watching her embrace Peeta and yet still did everything he could for her. Peeta tried to kill himself repeatedly for her, knowing full well that Katniss would probably live out the rest of her life miserable and insane. Is that really kindness on his part, or a selfish desire to go out a martyr? After reading the novels, Peeta comes off as more and more immature and selfish, constantly begging for death and wallowing in the hopeless idealism of defying the capitol. Gale is the one that truly helps Katniss. He saves over 900 lives from District 12, including Prim and Katniss' mother. He is constantly on the front lines, fighting for the revolution so all Katniss has to do is appear in the propos. He takes bullets and bits to the neck for her. Sure, Peeta saves her life in the Games, but even then, he still tries to kill himself every moment possible rather then do something useful, like actually protect Katniss.<br /><br />Ultimately, Mockingjay attempts to reach new heights in young adult literature, but fails to truly grasp its own themes and leaves its characters to die in pathetic write-offs.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. As an advertising graduate, I think traditional media outlets are overrated. That's just me of course, but I prefer someone who wants to engage with me, not just sell me something. I believe in the power of word-of-mouth, especially when it comes to books- so I suppose I was predisposed to like his use of social networking and blogging. It may seem like simple advice and it is- but the problem is, is that no one does it. They don't try and brand them self, they don't try to make sure their content is interesting to their fans, they don't use twitter and social networking to their advantage.<br /><br />Of course it's not for everyone and it's not for every book. However, having read quite a few books on marketing your book, it is a fresh perspective and therefore, in my opinion, worth a read. Best of all, it's short, concise and to the point. He doesn't ramble and he shows you exactly how his system worked for him.<br /><br />Unless you hire a professional, no one will be doing this for you- so don't just think because you read it your work is done. It's his success story, not yours. You have to take the nuggets of knowledge and make them your own.

0307454568|5.0|When last we saw Lisbeth she was buried alive with three bullets lodged in her body, one of which was in her brain.  Now she is recuperating in a hospital, but she has no electronic links with the outside world.  Her wounded father lies in a nearby bed, just a few steps from hers and he is planning to finish the job on her.  Her psychotic, feels-no-pain brother is still at large and he would like some payback.  The secret section within Sapo is plotting to isolate her in a mental institution (or worse), while Blomkvist seeks to save Lisbeth, tell her full story, bring the secret section to justice and balance his personal life.  His sister is defending Lisbeth, but she has little trial experience and is working to secure Lisbeth's trust.<br /><br />Bottom line: The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest begins with an extremely broad canvas and manages a large number of intertwined plots and subplots as it moves, inexorably to its end.  Larsson is having his way with us.  He knows that we want Lisbeth out and about.  He knows that we want to see justice done (make that bloody justice with a capital J).  He also knows that we know that we are very likely to be satisfied, but he is determined to make us wait.<br /><br />The third novel in the Millennium trilogy (or, as I would term it, the Salander Saga) does offer the gratification that we have been hungry for over the course of 1500+ pages of text.  At the same time it delays that gratification so as it render it more sweet, more exquisite, more perfect.<br /><br />Some have complained that there is too little of Lisbeth in the third novel.  However, the claustrophobic setting and situation present her with challenges that make her actions all the more satisfying.  This is a novel built on slowly-building rhythms that will end in a final crescendo, with Lisbeth getting her day in court and her final moments with her horrific brother.  The film version is the finest of the three, in my opinion, remembering that it is a courtroom drama and not, e.g. a locked-room (locked-island) mystery like the first installment.  I believe that I also prefer the third novel, though the first two have wonderful moments and the overall conception is richly imagined and fully realized.<br /><br />There is enough exposition in the last novel to make it a standalone, but all readers should read all three, in sequence.  This is very fine stuff, but it is a different kind of novel than its predecessors and each should be judged on its own terms.  I would warn my writing students not to try to do what Larsson has done here--in effect written 655 pages which build to the equivalent of about 30 pages or less.  Larsson pulls it off, I believe, but most could not.<br /><br />Highly recommended.urtroom drama and not, e.g. a locked-room (locked-island) mystery like the first installment.

0553381695|5.0|I am currently re-reading A Clash of Kings to refresh my memory for season 2 of the HBO series, and I couldn't put it down even though I remember most of the major events of the book. The characters and plotlines are just so well done. I absolutely love the description and the dialogue of the story, even so that the dialogue is in some ways even better than the Hollywood action one might find towards the end of book 2 and in book 3.<br /><br />I started yesterday and today I am on page 350. It is perfectly structured, with characters and chapters most interesting such as Tyrion and Arya appearing most. All the other POV characters that survived the first book return, and there are also 2 new POV Characters to detail the 2 new kings in the War of Five Kings. Theon Greyjoy, a minor character of the first book, is upgraded to a major character with this installment and his story details his moral battle.<br /><br />For 10 years he was raised by the Starks, and now that he is back home he must prove to his father that he actually is in fact still a Greyjoy and not a Stark, and doing that in some ways requires him to challenge his loyalty to the Starks.<br /><br />Another new POV character is a brand new character not seen in the first book, Davos. Davos serves King Robert's older brother Stannis, who was mentioned quite a bit in the first book but not seen. Davos has to deal with Stannis and his grab for power as he enters the war, and also try and cope with the mysterious 'Red Woman' also known as Melisandre, who brings her mysterious religion to Stannis and his people, causing many to question their loyalty to Stannis.<br /><br />Jon Snow and Dany (Can't remember for the life of me how to spell her full first name) don't have as many chapters here as they did in the first book. In the 350 pages I have read, Jon has had 2 chapters and Dany only 1. Jon's chapters are about The Night's Watch venturing north of the wall to try and look for Benjin Stark, who went missing in the first book, and Dany's chapters are about the aftermath of Khal Drogo's death and the birth of the dragons.<br /><br />So far every chapter has been interesting, especially Arya's and Tyrion's, and to those saying that this book doesn't pick up until the mid-point, I agreed with that until I re-read it. If you are finding a chapter without much action, try and picture the scenery that GRRM describes so wonderfully and imagine the dialogue in your head as if it was a movie. Truly the dialogue in this book is masterful. I almost feel as if I was watching a movie because the dialogue is so fluid in my head.<br /><br />I highly reccomend this series as a whole, and the second book is no exception. It takes everything started in the first book and makes it even better. Absolutely amazing acomplishment.

1612130283|4.0|This review is from: Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy (Kindle Edition)<br />Everyone had been raving about this book -- and I thought what the heck I need something new to read. So as far as the quality of writing it's on the same level as Laurel K Hamilton or Stephanie Meyer - it's clearly not Wuthering Heights quality.<br /><br />The focus of course is on the BDSM that's in the book. You need to side step that. I mean really. Take out the BDSM, (there's always something in erotica), and what you have left is a complex love story. Twenty-one year old college girl, virginal college girl, introverted is noticed and pursued by a powerful billionaire -- think really hot Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, or Donald Trump, with a super duper dark side, a kinky side. And while the book makes this guy out to be an Alpha male, dominate, he's really just a guy who doesn't like to be touched, has his own issues, and is probably on the spectrum somewhere.<br /><br />And while it may take a bit to cut through all the monotonous sex stuff (I mean there's only so many ways to read BDSM, or power exchange stuff) in the middle of all of that is indeed a very lovely story that has many layers to it, and I think if this author is smart he or she will explore further and show more of his vulnerable side.<br /><br />The reason it got four stars instead of three was the storyline itself was good, however, the way it was written, I agree with some of the other reviews, you can only say Holy you know what, or flushing so many times before you want to gouge your eyes out.

Unlike many other King novels I've read there was not the scary suspense, the kind where your not sure if you really want to turn the page, just the right amount of suspense.  The premise of the book is a little out there but as you read, and go through the motions with the charecters I'm sure you'll love it to.

Turns out I was somewhat correct, as I later learned, a large chunk of these tunes had been kicking around for years in some form or another.<br /><br />To be fair, there's some good to great stuff on here - \\"Sudden Death\\" was great in Guitar Hero and is a great opener, \\"We The People\\" and \\"New World Order\\" have a great rhythm and catchy chorus, \\"Never Dead\\" is a nice and lean little rocker, and \\"Wrecker\\" has some really cool stuff going on.<br /><br />The rest of the tracks are, at best, a mixed bag. At worst, we get drivel like \\"Fast Lane\\" (seriously don't trust Dave behind the wheel after \\"502\\" and this doesn't help) \\"Guns, Drugs, and Money\\" and \\"Deadly Nightshade\\" which are just all sorts of poor. Lame riffs, stupid lyrics, lazy arrangement.<br /><br />All in all, it's not the worst record they've done (I give that \\"honor\\" to \\"The System Has Failed\\") but it's a HUGE decline in quality from the fantastic \\"Endgame.\\"

0062082353|4.0|American Sniper was an enjoyable read, but most striking is Kyle's ability to write in a completely truthful introspective way, even when it's not always flattering towards him. It takes a certain type of confidence in yourself and what you've accomplished to write such a book.<br /><br />I'd guess that some readers will be jarred to read that Kyle enjoyed killing the enemy. It's a feeling that is obviously shared among most of the SEALs, Marines, and soldiers; but one that seems strangely brutal to a civilian. Along with that, Kyle conveys a stark reality that there are times where the solution is simple - killing lots of the enemy.
B0069SG4W0|2.0|Just a note to anyone purchasing this set: The 4th side does NOT contain an etching of the original 'electric woman' cover art.  It simply contains an etching of the lyrics to all the songs in a circle.  Apparently RHINO could not figure out how to get a usable image onto the wax and didn't feel the need to inform any potential buyers.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|As a former Marine, I was totally taken back at the conditions our WWII vets had to endure.  An excellent read and an eye opener.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was such an emotional ride. I was rooting for all 3 main characters the whole way. It was so hard to come to the end of the book, but I have to agree with the way Suzanne Collins ended the trilogy. With the condition that Katniss was in because of the Hunger Games I think that was the best way to end the story. That said I was still sad with how it ended. It was a happy ending for the way things happened, but at the same time so sad. It felt like something that would really happen if Hunger Games existed and caused the psychological toll that it did on the characters. I don't want to say more and ruin the story for anyone else. If you read the trilogy you will understand what I mean.<br /><br />I'm really glad I read this trilogy. It absorbed my imagination that even when I wasn't reading it I was thinking about it. Even now, that I have finished it I'm still thinking about the whole story and why it ended the way it did. Of course, the more I think about it the more I see exactly why it had to end the way it did. I'm glad I read it and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to read about some action with some major emotional pull. The wording was great and I wasn't lost at any point in the story line. I read it in about 5 days though so I think after I get some time to recooperate (even though I wasn't in the Hunger Games) I think I will read it again. I will just need some time to adjust to the happy, but still very sad ending....<br /><br />If you have any small interest in reading this book you won't be disappointed. There is a reason why so many people have given this book 5 stars. It's because it truly deserves the rating.

0061914177|2.0|I bought this book based on the average rating and the number of people that rated it. The description sounded good and I thought that maybe I would learn something.<br /><br />First off, I'd like to give the author credit for having passion and energy but unfortunately that's all this book has.<br /><br />The author begins by telling his audience what they'll learn throughout the book. Then he gives a brief bio. So far so good.<br /><br />After the 15th anecdote about how  business with billion dollar marketing budgets will just spontaneously find you if your provide a good product, I realized that I've been fooled.<br /><br />I know that the rating system at amazon has been going down hill, but I didn't realize that someone could keep such a high rating by an inordinately high amount of reviewers with this steaming heap.<br /><br />Anyway, the outline showed promise and if the author would have stuck to his formula about providing actual valuable information this would truly be a hit. Unfortunately it's just another case of someone making another hustle.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|I def. recommend this cd to any Rihanna superfan like me........the cd is just mad awesome and she really outdid herself from her last cd although all her cds rock anywayz. So, please order this cd if you really wanna dance and have mad fun listening to Rihanna, it's we'll worth it!
B005RUUUAI|2.0|TWD started out very good, but has since become a show that revolves completely around 1 character-- Rick Grimes. Now I know this is based on the comics, but the problem for me is he isn't all that exciting or interesting. So if you happen to like anybody else, then don't bother with the show since they will eventually be killed-off. Rick's family is a bunch of bumbling idiots and the other characters are merely slaves beholden to what King Rick wants. The only other person to stand-up to Rick was Shane and he is dead now along with Dale. T-Dogg might as well be dead since he justs sits in the corner and says 1 sentence every 2-3 shows. Lori(Ricks wife) is a very unlikeable woman who thinks the world revolves around her. Their son Carl is a doofus who wanders around alone all the time creating mayhem for the rest. Andrea is the best female in the group(her sister was already killed-off), but she doesn't seem to fit in with the rest and has no connections to anyone else. Glenn is a somewhat amicable Asian dude, but the others treat him like crap and he is rather meek. Daryl is a redneck kinda guy with a crossbow who is a loner and survivalist type, but again given no personality since he must follow Rick's every wish like a beaten old dog. Carol -whose daughter Sophia is already dead- is totally useless, kinda like a lifeless prop on a stage. It's pretty funny that Rick constantly makes decisions for the whole group that have repeatedly gotten people killed by his poor decisions, yet the others blindly tag along much like the mindless zombies all around. And speaking of the zombies, they too are props, since this story is really about diferent surviving groups fighting it out--and not a zombie series per se. So in conclusion if you want a show that's really about 1 man(Rick) and his bumbling misadventures that slowly but surely get everyone else in the group killed-off, you'll enjoy TWD.

B005V2EVBQ|3.0|I purchased this product for my folks for Christmas because I had heard such great reviews.  They took it to several different locations in order to try and get someone to help them download books.  They are still not understanding how to do it, plus the 75.00 Amazon gift card is still sitting on top of it, as they have not yet purchased any ebooks.  It is probably easier than they are making it out to be, but as of this moment I am feeling I should not have purchased this product.
0385342063|5.0|I couldn't wait to dive into Sophie Kinsella's latest novel, I've Got Your Number. I'm not sure who sent it to me, but it showed up in my mailbox one day and I squealed in excitement when I opened the package. And can you believe it - I'm giving it a five star review! Shocking, right? I just love Kinsella and her stories, and this one was right up there. You know when you read a book and it just keeps making you laugh out loud? And then every once in a while you snort with laughter? That was me all the way.<br /><br />The story follows Poppy Wyatt, whose world gets flipped upside down when she loses her engagement ring. Shortly after her ring goes missing, she loses her cell phone - her lifeline! She finds a cell phone in a trash can and decides to claim it as her own. It was in a trash can - clearly the owner had given it up. But she finds out the phone actually belonged to the assistant of Sam Roxton, a very busy and angry businessman, and he wants it back! Poppy eventually convinces Sam to let her keep the phone for a while longer, at least until she hears back about her lost engagement ring. Poppy finds herself a bit bored, and starts reading through some of the text and emails that she is forwarding to Sam. Before she knows it, she is practically playing assistant to Sam, and finds herself immersed in some of his personal business. Poppy thinks a spark might be happening between her and Sam - but how could that be? She is set to marry her ideal man. Sure, they don't have much in common and his family seems less than impressed with her but still - she knows this marriage is the right thing to do. Right?<br /><br />I whipped through this story, cracking up along the way. One scene I'll point out - and you'll only get if you read the story - was the gift Poppy tried on that was meant for her fianc&eacute;'s mother. I was red in the face from laughing so hard. Wait, one more I want to point out. When Poppy is buying a fake engagement ring to play off as the real one. That scene with the jewelry sales girl was AMAZING. All I can say - read this book! You won't be disappointed.t scene with the jewelry sales girl was AMAZING. All I can say - read this book! You won't be disappointed.

This is truly a blueprint on how to build a Silicon Valley style scalable startup.
B004EPZ0AC|2.0|Pr-ordered the DVD, was very excited because my daughter and I really loved the the 1st Happy Feet. The sequel was lacking the very thing that made the 1st one wonderful, the singing and dancing. There were about half the singing and dancing than the 1st one, loved the baby chicks but it should have been so much more. This was a let down :(

B007H7XJD4|4.0|I really liked this movie, from beginning to end.  I was a little worried by the number of negative reviews it got, and had to push myself to make the leap to rent it, but now I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The movie's color scheme and tinting were on the dark side as some have noted, but I didn't have any trouble viewing any of the movie, including a 20 minute segment I watched on my Nexus One AMOLED screen while I was waiting for some code to build.  I thought the color scheme and tinting actually gave it a very dreamlike quality that lent itself well to a story from ancient times.  The scenes and sets were visually stunning in their detail without going overboard, and the action was awesome; reminding me of fight scenes from Spartacus (but without the Kill Bill style blood and whatnot.)  I also thought the acting from the entire cast was very good.  The only long monologues were carried out by the veteran actors like John Hurt and Mickey Rourke, but I thought that the rest of the cast did a great job on their parts as well.<br /><br />The story only very loosely fallows the Theseus tales, and the gods are cast in a VERY humane light (though that isn't completely unheard of in Greek mythos), but I still liked how the story was structured and molded together along with all the action.  All in all, it's a recasting of an ancient myth, but given that I've heard multiple versions of this myth, it worked fine for me.  If any are curious to see what the movie is like, you can always go to YouTube and watch what people have uploaded there.  I noticed some of the uploads are slightly edited, but at least you can see if it's something you're interested in.
B0053O89WY|5.0|You either like the Big Bang Theory or you don't; much like back in the day either one liked Cheers and/or Seinfeld or they didn't.  To be honest I wasn't expecting much out of the program when it first aired; but my son who is a Physics major wanted to watch it.  He enjoys the nerdiness of the show; I on the other hand I am at times intrigued with the flip flopping and social dynamics between the nerds and the supposed \\"socially normal\\" characters.  In the first seasons they focused more on introducing physics theories in a back door way to the general public.  For me the earlier episodes were the best ones, but as with any series, there has to be evolution, both good and bad or the series goes stale and shrivels up.  If you have never seen this program, watch it a few times in order to get to know the characters and their dynamics, before passing judgement on the show itself.

B00005NGAK|5.0|This was Michael Flatley's masterpiece.  The man was told as a child he was too old to learn Irish step dancing.  He fooled them.  He had a dream and went on to win the Irish National Dance Championship.  The program is well choreographed.  The staging is beautiful.  The plot is clever and the dancers are very talented.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone interested in any kind of percussive dance.  Michael Flatley got his start in Video in a film called Riverdance.  It also is a lovely DVD as are any of Flatley's dance video's.  Yes, I'm a fan.  I'm a flamenco dancer myself and enjoyed very much watching Maria Pages in Riverdance do a flamenco number.  She has very beautiful arm and upper body movements.  She is known as \\"Maria of the Endless Arms.\\"  She is a very accomplished Flamenco dancer.

B001HN694K|5.0|This film is a marvel of a mix of technology and live acting.  Some of the characters, for instance the Bandersnach, are totally computer generated characters.  The actors worked in green screen for much of the film  Their bodies were electonically wired to grasp their movements then their costumes and real faces were added later.  I love the alice in wonderland story.  I've read the original.  I've read the annotated Alice where Twas Brillig is translated into understandable English.  A wonderful story and a wonderful movie.  Johnny Depp is great as the mad hatter.  The casting was excellent as was the costuming.  I kept checking it out of the library until I finally decided to buy my copy from Amazon.

It is by far the best book I've read this year.<br /><br />Wonder follows 10 year-old Auggie, who has a severe deformity of the face, on his first year, as a 5th grader, in public school. Because of all the surgeries he's had over the years he had been home-schooled by his mom and has never been to public school.  The story is told through several characters so you get several perspectives of Auggie and how he touches their lives.<br /><br />I was surprised at how much Wonder touched me. I found myself tearing up quite often. It was not something I expected from a book for middle readers.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|just make sure when you install it that all the male mounting screws easily line up with the receiving female bracket. when i installed mine the first time, i didnt line everything up properly, and i really forced the screws into their position and overtightened the fan to the cpu, with disastrous results. when i tried again, after having to get a new motherboard, i took my time to line everything up, and the screws all fell into place nicely with no force involved. lesson learned.

0061777250|5.0|This is a well written academic study of near death experiences.  It provides some excellent arguments on whether these experiences were actual memories or whether they were hallucinations, drug side effects, pain induced reactions, psychological whims, or just pure human imaginations of death.  The change in people's attitude toward life and death is something every reader should ponder.  The discussions about our current knowledge of memory, thoughts and consciousness reveal that we make too many assumptions about our minds.
0756405890|5.0|I've read a lot of fantasy books. A LOT, but it's rare to come across something so fresh, witty and unique in the genre... and this is all three, without question.<br />It's almost as if George RR Martin and Stephen Fry had a love child (as unthinkably bizarre as that may seem), and the fruit of this unlikely and no doubt awkward coupling? Pat Rothfuss.<br /><br />I'm absolutely ACHING for the third installment and only Stephen King's The Dark Tower series had that effect on me in the past.<br />Excellent characters (which is the backbone of any good yarn), a magic system that's actually believable (if that makes sense) and well... a GREAT love story as well. While not a particularly fast paced book, you have the feeling that there's no word out of place, no unnecessary padding which you tends to happen frequently in fantasy books.<br /><br />Can't really say more except: Buy the bugger! You won't be disappointed.
B0042EJD5I|5.0|One important caveat: if you for any reason don't like \\"progressive rock\\" of the late 1960's, do not buy this LP.<br /><br />Otherwise I'd suggest that you do, and here is why:<br /><br />I believe that many previous pressings of the 'Court' had been made from the copies of the original tapes, whereas this particular version was mastered from the originals by Steven Wilson and was approved by Robert Fripp. Both these gentlemen are fairly well versed in making rather good records.<br /><br />There is an on-going argument whether the heavy weight vinyl sounds somewhat better - caeteris paribus - than the \\"standard\\" vinyl. I wouldn't bet my life on it, but one thing is for sure: this 200 gram LP certainly does FEEL great. Not going to warp, sag and flop in your hands under its own weight like a tortilla - which, unfortunately, some of the thinner LP's tend to do.<br /><br />The envelope quality is impeccable, and even the inner sleeve is of my favorite 'polymer inside, paper outside' type, with cleverly trimmed corners for easy inserting.<br /><br />The LP is modestly priced; also, mine came with the mp3 download code @ 320K bits/sec, which means I didn't have to rip the LP for the car.

886293713X|5.0|I give this every year to my non-tech, computer adverse girlfriend to help her keep track of her to dos that she keeps forgetting about. She loves everything about this little red book. Part of it was also showing her how to manage her time, prioritizing her tasks. She even started giving it to her friends. The format is perfect for scheduling her many tasks. The pocket in the back of the book (it took her a year to discover it) also helps her organize notes and to hold the address book that she moves from each calendar year to the next calendar year's book. For me? I love the gridded small notebook that I can draw and take notes in when something strikes my interest and I don't want it lost in my phone notes. Love you Moleskin!
B0074JODP8|5.0|Joe Bonamassa once more sets the blues/rock world on fire with the release of his new 'live' DVD... Joe Bonamassa: Beacon Theatre - Live From New York.  Recorded at the historic Beacon Theatre in New York during his current world tour, Tal Bergman is on Drums, Carmine Rojas plays Bass & Rick Melick is at the Keyboards with very special guest appearances by Beth Hart, John Hiatt & Paul Rodgers!  Kevin \\"Caveman\\" Shirley who also produced Dust Bowl is again credited for the astounding sound mix that must be heard to be believed, and indeed everyone involved in the production of this sensational DVD should take a bow!<br /><br />Joe Bonamassa continues to fascinate his audience with his gifted guitar and passionate vocals, and whilst extending his own repertoire, he also makes sure he pays tribute to all the people who inspired him along the way.  Like all great musicians Joe Bonamassa knows it's not just what you play that's important, but how you feel and deliver it that matters... and this guy certainly knows how to do just that!<br /><br />Disc 1 (Feature) starts with an interesting opening sequence showing Joe Bonamassa busking '72nd St. Subway Blues' at the same location in New York.  He then joins his band at the Beacon Theatre to open the show with his pulsating 'Slow Train' followed by 'Cradle Rock', 'When The Fire Hits The Sea', 'Midnight Blues', 'Dust Bowl' and 'The River'.  Next enter one of the most powerful female blues/rock singers to emerge since Janis Joplin... Beth Hart joins Joe onstage, having worked together on Dust Bowl before making their stunning hit collaboration album Don't Explain.  Bonamassa's guitar once again provides the perfect foil for Hart's soulful vocals as she beautifully delivers Brook Benton's 'I'll Take Care Of You' (worth the entry fee alone) and then pleads for mercy on 'Sinner's Prayer', probably just as Ray Charles imagined when he wrote it... simply breathtaking!<br /><br />Worthwhile renditions of 'You Better Watch Yourself'' and 'Steal Your Heart Away' precede a heartfelt cover of Leonard Cohen's 'Bird On A Wire'.  American songwriter/musician John Hiatt then makes his entrance with 'Down Around My Place' off his excellent Dirty Jeans And Mudslide Hymns album and 'I Know A Place' that nearly brings the house down, and rightly so as this storyteller is way overdue the recognition he truly deserves!  After being treated to 'Blue and Evil' off his Black Rock album, rock royalty takes centre stage with Paul Rodgers (Free/Bad Co/Queen) singing the first song he ever wrote 'Walk In My Shadow', prior to strutting out another Free classic 'Fire And Water' aptly fuelled by Bonamassa with Kossoff inspired guitar riffs... totally spellbinding!  And just as you thought this concert couldn't get any better, you get blown away with a monumental version of 'Mountain Time' before 'Young Man Blues' ends this memorable set.<br /><br />Disc 2 (Bonus Disc) boasts another couple of fine tracks from the gig... 'If Heartaches Were Nickels' and his acoustic extravaganza 'Woke Up Dreaming'.  Other special features include 'A Friend Drops By' that reveals amazing footage of Joe discussing chord structures with Byrds/CSNY legend David Crosby!  Finally 'A Busker's Tale' explains the making of '72nd St. Subway Blues' that opened proceedings followed by some memorable photos & credits... end!<br /><br />For those of you who couldn't make it...

It is indeed remarkable that this bright young man excelled at a world class level in two very different disciplines. He says, \\"I've come to realize that what I am best at is not Tai Chi, and it is not chess. What I am best at is the art of learning.\\"<br /><br />Early in the book, he describes how some developmental psychologists distinguish theories of intelligence--between entity and incremental theories. Simply put, \\"children who are entity theorists, that is, kids who have been influenced by their parents and teachers to think in this manner--are prone to use language like 'I am smart at this' and to attribute their success or failure to an ingrained and unalterable level of ability...Incremental theorists, who have picked up a different modality of learning...are more prone to describe their results with sentences like `I got it because I worked very hard at it' or `I should have tried harder.' A child with a learning theory of intelligence tends to sense that with hard work, difficult material can be grasped--step by step, incrementally, the novice can become a master.\\" The author describes how fragile the entity theorists can be under pressure, even though gifted, compared to the incremental theorists. \\"The key to pursuing excellence is to embrace an organic, long-term learning process, and not to live in a shell of static, safe mediocrity. Usually growth comes at the expense of previous comfort or safety.\\"<br /><br />Waitzkin addresses the caveat about being process oriented to the point of not caring about results--that winning or losing doesn't matter. It does matter and losing hurts, but it can also be a valuable learning experience. \\"While a fixation on results is certainly unhealthy, short-term goals can be useful developmental tools if they are balanced within a nurturing long-term philosophy. Too much sheltering from results can be stunting. The road to success is not easy or else everyone would be the greatest at what they do.\\"<br /><br />He discusses the problem of distractions, the random unexpected events, the \\"mini-earthquakes that afflict all of our days\\" and the need to \\"flow with whatever comes\\" and \\"to use whatever comes to our advantage.\\" To actually accomplish this, one has \\"to attain what sports psychologists call The Soft Zone.\\" A good way to explain it is to define The Hard Zone, a state of mind that \\"demands a cooperative world for you to function.\\" But the world is not always so cooperative. The Soft Zone is quiet, intensely focused, relaxed: \\"You flow with whatever comes, integrating every ripple of life into your creative moment. This Soft Zone is resilient, like a flexible blade of grass that can move with and survive hurricane-force winds.\\" One has to learn to deal with bad conditions. Brian learned how to achieve this state by playing in bars for fifteen years --he concentrated on the playing, not the obnoxious drunks, the fights, the noise, or other distractions of the environment. One learns to tune it out; and it is a learned discipline. Most people cannot just will it, including the author. Waitzkin says, \\"Mental resilience is arguably the most critical trait of a world-class performer, and it should be nurtured continuously...I am always looking for ways to become more and more psychologically impregnable.\\"<br /><br />Waitzkin tells the story of how he ultimately became frustrated with chess. I won't go into the details but he says, \\"I believe that one of the most critical factors in the transition to becoming a conscious high performer is the degree to whichyour relationship to your pursuit stays in harmony with your unique disposition...it is critical to integrate...new information in a manner that does not violate who we are,\\" which gives a hint of why he moved on to other things. Later, finishing up on the last years of his chess career, he says, \\"To my mind, the fields of learning and performance are an exploration of grayness--of the in-between. There is the careful balance of pushing yourself relentlessly, but not so hard that you melt down...A competitor needs to be process-oriented...but it is also important to keep on winning enough to maintain confidence...Vibrant, creative idealism needs to be tempered by a practical, technical awareness.\\" In other words, it is a tricky balancing act requiring self-awareness.<br /><br />As he explains the genesis of his martial arts career, Waitzkin gives some insight to his thinking by giving kudos to Jack Kerouac's On the Road and The Dharma Bums, which probably influenced his dabbling in Zen Buddhism. My book review of The Dharma Bums gives a slightly different perspective than Waitzkin (on both books), but I won't dwell on this aspect of his book. I just found it interesting that he gives credit to Kerouac's influence.<br /><br />In a chapter called, Making Smaller Circles, the author delves into the theme of \\"depth over breadth.\\" He says, \\"The learning principle is to plunge into the detailed mystery of the micro in order to understand what makes the macro tick. Our obstacle is that we live in an attention-deficit culture\\" bombarded with a \\"constant supply of stimulus\\" which has a devastating effect on our learning...unless we can keep our focus on working on the micro fundamentals of our endeavor, incrementally refining the simplest of movements and thought. This is a key point stressed by my guitar teacher--get this one simple movement perfected, then this one, then add them, then another, and build a pattern of sound that is built on these small perfected technical movements. The author writes of \\"subtle internalization and refinement\\" as being more important than trying to learn everything...It is rarely a mysterious technique that drives us to the top, but rather a profound mastery of what may well be a basic skill set. Depth beats breadth...because it opens a channel for the intangible, unconscious, creative components of our hidden potential.\\"<br /><br />In the chapter, Using Adversity, Waitzkin delves further into performance psychology and says there are three steps in a \\"resilient performer' s evolving relationship to chaotic situations.\\" (1) \\"First, we have to learn to be at peace with imperfection.\\" (2) \\"We learn to use that imperfection to our advantage.\\" (3) We need \\"to learn to create ripples in our consciousness...to spur us along, so we are constantly inspired whether or not external conditions are inspiring.\\"<br /><br />The author debates the question of intuition and whether it exists, concluding that it \\"is our most valuable compass in this world.\\" He gives a summary: \\"For much of this book I have described my vision of the road to mastery--you start with the fundamentals, get a solid foundation fueled by understanding the principles of your discipline, then you expand and refine your repertoire, guided by your predispositions, while keeping in touch, however abstractly, with what you feel to be the essential core of the art. What results is a network of deeply internalized, interconnected knowledge that expands from a central, personal locus point. The question of intuition relates to how that network is navigated and used as fuel for creative insight.\\" He refers to chunking which \\"relates to the mind's ability to assimilate large amounts of information into a cluster that is bound together by certain patterns or principles...\\" As one evolves in their endeavor, he or she discovers organizing principles of information and \\"new patterns of movement. This new information gets systematized into a network of chunksthat\\" can be accessed with increasing ease as one's \\"navigational function improves.\\" He further says, \\"Everyone at a high level has a huge amount of understanding, and much of what separates the great from the very good is deep presence, relaxation of the conscious mind, which allows the unconscious to flow unhindered... the idea is to shift the primary role from the conscious to the unconscious without blissing out and losing the precision the conscious can provide.\\" Brian considers the great jazz guitarist, Joe Pass, a good example of someone utilizing this process; he has boiled down playing music to its simplest forms--into chunks of basic approaches that are filled with huge amounts of information learned over the years but are buried within his mind; not lost, but known to him as bits of critical information that have been put together in such a way that allows him to see much more with less conscious thought. The author would say,\\" So he is looking at very little and seeing quite a lot.\\" And guess what? \\"The key, of course, is practice.\\" Indeed.<br /><br />He writes about presence, and the critical nature of it in \\"solitary pursuits, such as writing, painting, scholarly thinking, or learning\\" where \\"we must be our own monitor, and quality of presence is often our best gauge. We cannot expect to touch excellence if 'going through the motions' is the norm of our lives...Those who excel are those who maximize each moment's creative potential...The more present we are at practice, the more present we will be in competition, in the boardroom, at the exam, the operating table, the big stage...Presence must be like breathing.\\"<br /><br />There is also great value in understanding the sport's psychologist's concept of Stress and Recovery--a player's ability to completely relax in brief moments of inactivity. The best I ever saw able to do this--up close and personal--was tennis great Pete Sampras, a remarkable athlete that the author mentions. There are many more in the sports world who learned this and learned it well--those who have become completely attuned to the qualitative functions of their thought processes because they fully understand what it means to their performance. Also, on a personal level, from my marathoning days, back in the 1980's, I knew full well the value of stress and recovery in my training, both the physical and the mental, i.e. it is not a foreign concept. (I was clearly an amateur. In my forties then, my best time was 3:13:30 or 7:23 per mile in the San Francisco Marathon, 1987.) The author, however, suggests that one should incorporate \\"the rhythm of stress and recovery into all aspects of...life.\\" In other words, apply interval training approaches to everything we do, making it a habit, so we can become \\"a resilient dependable pressure player...To have success at crunch time, you need to integrate certain healthy patterns into your day-to-day life so that they are completely natural to you when the pressure is on. The real power of incremental growth comes to bear when we truly are like water, steadily carving stone. We just keep flowing when everything is one the line.\\"<br /><br />The author discusses channeling anger and mentions unethical chess players, like the guy who kicked him under the table repeatedly during critical moments, or the few dirty Tai Chi Chuan competitors. It isn't about denying one's passion at such moments; it is about channeling the anger to achievement rather than self-destructing behavior. I remember one of his examples well because I watched it many times on television: Huge New York Knick's fan and movie director Spike Lee would sit on the sidelines and taunt the Indiana Pacer's Reggie Miller unmercifully during NBA games at Madison Square Garden. Reggie responding by draining shot after shot; he fed off of it. It didn't bug him; it inspired him! The best thing Lee could have done was shut up. \\"The lesson learned--don't piss off Reggie.\\"<br /><br />To bring this to conclusion, Waitzkin says, \\"When I think about creativity, it is always in relation to a foundation. We have our knowledge. It becomes deeply internalized until we can access it without thinking about it. Then we have a leap that uses what we know to go one or two steps further. We make a discovery... There is a connection between that discovery and what you know--or else you wouldn't have discovered it--and you can find that connection if you try.\\" One has to \\"figure out what makes the 'magic' tick\\" on his own--to take our \\"pyramid of knowledge up\\" to another level, solidifying a \\"higher foundation from new leaps.\\"<br /><br />Like many have said before: \\"Practice, man, practice.\\" Or as coach Vince Lombardi once said: \\"Practice does not make perfect. Only perfect practice makes perfect.\\"that\\" can be accessed with increasing ease as one's \\"navigational function improves.\\" He further says, \\"Everyone at a high level has a huge amount of understanding, and much of what separates the great from the very good is deep presence, relaxation of the conscious mind, which allows the unconscious to flow unhindered... the idea is to shift the primary role from the conscious to the unconscious without blissing out and losing the precision the conscious can provide.\\" Brian considers the great jazz guitarist, Joe Pass, a good example of someone utilizing this process; he has boiled down playing music to its simplest forms--into chunks of basic approaches that are filled with huge amounts of information learned over the years but are buried within his mind; not lost, but known to him as bits of critical information that have been put together in such a way that allows him to see much more with less conscious thought.

1451683405|2.0|My enthusiasm with this essay (not really a book, it's too short) decreased as the reading progressed, and it has not stopped doing so.<br /><br />Harris makes it look as if he has neatly packed and solved a central and very old problem.  Methinks not - not with the kind of reasoning he puts forward, anyway.<br /><br />The central argument that is iterated (over and over) is:<br />\\"I may be able to choose, but I cannot choose what I choose\\"<br /><br />I cannot imagine an entity that is given free will in a sense that complies with the above objection. Because of that, I am lead to think that either the objection is self-satisfying (and therefore not very helpful, sort of saying \\"black is black\\" when asked to define black) or the idea of free will is intrinsically meaningless (like the \\"height of sweetness\\"), or - finally - that the underlying definition of free will is so bad that we need to go back to the drawing board and lay a few more foundations before going on.<br /><br />I will have to get a different book though, because this one is extremely wanting on all this.
B001AQTWF2|4.0|I love the CD - took too long to receive it. Don't know if it is because it was shipped from overseas or not.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|It is a pleasure reading about the master detective Mr. Sherlock Holmes. The short stories in this book are very good.
B0035JRVR8|5.0|I adore Roman Holiday. This is a beautiful movie that I have loved for many years and was my guidebook to Rome when I finally got to go in person. The movie shipped quickly, and I was able to sit down and relish in all the sights that I had seen as well. A great chick-flick that never fails to please.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Love all the different challenges. Great game, works well on Samsung Galaxy. Good for kids and adults of all ages.
1400069289|4.0|One definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. So if you are wanting a  different result you have to change what you are doing. Or else there is that whole insanity thing staring you in the face.<br /><br />In the Power of Habit the author Charles Duhigg links to the insanity (se above) of people expecting to change an outcome without changing the input or process. In the book these three points in the process are called Cue - Routine - Reward.<br /><br />Simple,  yet complex. As in any endeavour to deconstruct or reverse engineer anything to do with humans, the devil is in the details. What looks like something simple upon first observation, becomes increasingly complex as you peel away the layers. Humans are emotional and non linear. Plus just to make life interesting, and it does, we all sing along to a different playbook. One that is created by who you are, who your relatives are, who you run into in life, karma (had to throw that one in), your education  and how you use all this to problem solve.<br /><br />The Cue, Routine, Reward trilogy is an attempt to simplify the process and it works. The author gives us examples where changes to the routine can have sometimes dramatic changes. Sometimes the changes to the routine are small and sometimes they are large.<br /><br />The author goes further in that he starts with humans and then moves onto organizations and societies using the same trilogy of cue, routine, and reward.<br /><br />For anyone who wants at least a small chance of understanding why we do what we do, why organizations and society acts as it does this book will be insightful and instructive.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|loved it! could not put it down and the second and now third book! Best trilogy i have EVER read :)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It took me less than 2 weeks to read.  I caught on to the foreshadowing fast so that wasn't great but the end of the trilogy did surprise me so I guess that makes up for it.  I can't wait for the movie next week!! YAY!
B000I3PERS|5.0|Braveheart has to be one of the best movies ever made.  The streaming from Amazon worked just fine too, there was only one brief moment where it paused, but that could've been my bad internet connection.  I'd recommend this service/movie to anyone.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Excellent film in all respects and very true to the era. Having grown up in the South, I can attest to the utter disdain of many whites who thought nothing of exploiting the black people whenever they got the chance. The actors in this film were true to form in their portrayal of the characters so movingly written about. Another plus, the Southern accents were authentic and not over exaggerated. An all-round fine movie. I was disappointed, however, that Viola Davis didn't get the Academy Award for her performance. She deserved more than a pat on the back.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|The CD is awesome, and Stephen Schwartz is a genius. There's no doubt whatsoever that the music from 'Wicked' is delightful to listen, and that Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth rock.<br />I was very pleased to receive the product completely scratchless, in less time than estimated.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I go to work and play, I play it during class, I play it when I should be asleep, and I just cant get enough!
B003ASLJO0|5.0|(spoilers in this review)Gran Torino is a movie about a racist Korean War veteran named Walt Kowalski played by Clint Eastwood. In movie opens and closes with a funeral. The first one being Walt's wife's, where we learn that the members of his family are spoiled and selfish. Walt is living in the fifties, although his neighborhood is very different from what it was back then. Hmong people have moved in all around him. And being that he is racist he doesn't really like this not only because they are Hmong but also because they can't seem to keep up their yards or houses. One night someone tries to steal his prized Gran Torino that he helped build in the ford factory. Walt comes after them with his other prized possession his rifle. Later he find out it was his neighbor Thao's gang initiation, after spending a considerable amount of time with Thao and his family. By the end of the movie Walt becomes close with Thao, his sister Su and the rest of the family except Grandma. And because of Walt trying to protect them from the Hmong gang the family suffers the repercussions. Thao wants revenge for the gang hurting his family but Walt will not allow this. Walt sacrifices his life in order to give Thao and Su a chance in life. Because with the gang in the neighborhood Walt believed they had no chance.<br /> I would give this movie five stars, I loved it. I think the movie did a great job in painting Walt's family in a negative way. I know their portrayal made me hate them in the first few minutes, which helped me understand some of the reason why Walt was miserable. I think audiences will appreciate the humor although it's very vulgar, and will be touched by the act of love and selflessness that is Walt's sacrifice for Thao and Su.
0985081821|5.0|This book had me hooked from the first page. The characters were totally likeable. I found it easy to just let the story take me wherever it was going, and there were definitely some surprise twists in there.  Started and finished in 24 hours - didn't want to put it down!<br /><br />Looking forward to the next book in the series!
B006P3HXZG|5.0|Now the Shrek movies were hilarious good fun, but this spin off, man o man, its non stop laughs.<br /><br />Might not be appropriate for the smallest kids, but nothing too suggestive or whatnot (nobody dies and everyone thats naked is an animal without anatomy showing) for most folks.<br /><br />And the 3d was quite nicely done, Im using a ps3 with a high speed 3d capable hdmi cable, a panasonic 50 inch 3d plasma, and shutter glasses and it was fantastic.
B000E1JOSE|5.0|great singer.  It has two instrumentals that are great beat and guitar playing. I saw this cd in action on public televison and knew right away I had to have a copy

B005SFS4ZU|4.0|I'm a grown man, brought to tears song and song again. I'm not a die hard Phantom fan, but grew up with it, so it will always have a soft spot in my heart. After buying this DVD, I now understand the story better than ever before. I've seen the Phantom of the Opera in person (in California) and was left wanting more. This DVD captures what is hard to see in person. Multiple -decisive- camera angles, exaggerated and beautifully crafted, elaborate costumes. All in top notch, Blu-ray crisp quality. And of course, top notch actors working with one of Webber's finest scripts. You will never see this kind of production live, not even if you were one of the few lucky individuals present in Albert Hall that evening. The shots and scenes portrayed here could only be seen if you flew around the auditorium on a Jet-pack. I look forward to watching this DVD many times, sometimes just for the music alone, other times for the spectacle.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|SOOOOOO good!! Adele has an awesome voice.....Good listening music!<br />Received the CD in just a couple of days. Excellent service.
0736092269|4.0|I compared with other anatomy book but I like this book better.<br />Because of easier to understand and clear images and good information.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty good, I like that u have to win the games to buy more. it makes it more of a challenge. some of the games are dumb, but its a good time killer.

B0028DRGDQ|4.0|Handheld POV horror from Spain, in which a small, unwitting television crew tails a pair of firemen into the mouth of madness. The Blair Witch / Paranormal Activity thing has been done a dozen times over by now, with varying degrees of believability and success, but this is one of the better examples of what the format can do. Starting slow with a series of missed cues and tame vignettes for the camera that introduce the primary characters, (a cute minor TV personality and the two generic firemen who allow her to tag along for the evening) it slowly, deliberately adds new faces and developments, building tension until everything finally boils over in a geyser of chaos and terror. Working wonders with a small cast of unknowns, it wrings every bit of potential out of an admirably simple concept without stretching beyond its means. The storyline is equal parts quiet suspense and startling horror, masking its budgetary shortcomings with a temperamental light source and a set of large-lunged ladies. I'm not often one to take the bait and jump during this kind of flick, but even I have to admit it caught me once or twice. A solid, entertaining ball of dread that reaches and surpasses the limits of its overplayed genre, it's great material for a dark, windy night at home.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|points are needed to get other games. its a fun incentive. they give an option to buy points, but you have to be strong enough to resist.

B005IU1OMA|3.0|This wasn't a very personal film at all.  It was more about the terrain and the successful runs over the terrain.  The film could have been a little deeper if it went through the daily grind that the riders endured through travel, practice runs, and hanging together.  Towards the end of the film it started to develop some \\"characters.\\"  I am all for watching some of the most beautiful cinematography ever shot of the human spirit conquering their fears and going literally where no man has gone before.  However, I think the film would have been better served by having the riders talk about themselves a little more in order for the audience to have a connection with them and their brilliant endeavors.  At the end it comes out like, \\"Red Bull gave us a lot of money. Let's film getting the best shots as fast as we can.  Screw building up our riders.  Screw showing anything emotional or captivating events outside of the runs.\\" The runs are only half the story and unfortunately the other half was never even considered.  It's worth watching once, but you will not find yourself coming back to it and to me that is the measure of a good film.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I honestly don't understand the few poor reviews that this book has received. Collins is able provoke deep thinking through her action packed story telling, keeping the reader engaged from start to finish. Granted, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone younger than I am (I'm 13), due to certain violent and disturbing situations that Katniss is forced in to, but overall it was a very enticing read.
B005SYLKT8|4.0|this cd is classic meshell. saw her at hiro last year. have seen her live 14 times. get this cd. she is an incredibly imaginative artist in constant change :)
B005SDDB9Q|5.0|This just may be the best rock-n-roll album that I have ever heard. These recordings were made a few months before I born.  I can't think of a better 38 years belated birthday present.  It contains most everything I like about music: poetry, humor, jazzy elements, jangly guitars, goose bump inducing crescendos, and lot's of heart. After just one listen, it is safe to say that this album has improved my quality of life.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|game gets boring sometimes but is great to pass time when your bored and don't have much else to do :)

B005K17RU0|4.0|i like the app when its working to give me a quick look at the temp and check the forcast i just wish since i have the wiget installed that it didnt keep sending me alerts and maybe changed the color of either the text or the background on the wiget to alert me to a change in the weather since the last time i saw it instead of killing my battery with all the alerts that keep popping up
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun to play, lots of levels.  Even the grandkids play it.  No instructions needed to start but do need to figure out the different functions the birds can do.
1603429999|5.0|I just received this as a gift,and still can't get over the beauty and thoroughness of it!  The photography is outstanding, and Ms. Radcliffe takes you step by step through everything....e.g. an adorable child's vest with explanations of how to adapt and modify the neckline or other parts. Don't be fooled by the title:  even though circular needles are used and explained for all the projects, one could easily adapt the patterns to their own needle preference! Who knew there were so many ways to kitchner....clear and concise, and a must have for your library.
B004LWZW7O|3.0|In Time is a science fiction thriller about a future world where scientists have managed to turn off the aging gene making everyone unaging, to avoid massive over population a system is put into place where everyone is born with a timer on their right arm, once a person turn 25 years old they stop aging and the timer start counting down one year, one the timer runs out the person dies. Now in this world time is currency, the lower class is working to earn another day of life, everything is paid for with hours and minutes, and then you have a rich upper class who live in luxury and literary have all the time in the world making them immortal. The main character is a poor man named Will Salas who after a chance encounter with a suicidal but rich man end up with over 100 years of life and a knowledge of how corrupt the whole system realty is. Will off course soon meet a beautiful woman, the rich man's daughter Sylvia who share his idea on the unfairness of the system. The rest of the movie is part a modern time Robin Hood story and part social commentary about social inequality.<br /><br />In Time have a great concept. In many ways the story is very similar to the Jack Vance novel To Live Forever, the idea of s dystopian future where people's lives are used as currency is interesting and draw you into the story. I love the way time is transferred between people as they only need to touch one another's arms, this create a distance between people as everyone is always afraid of having their time stolen. I also like the world building, how we get a good look at what life must be like in this society, Science Fiction is all about asking what if, what if this technology where part of human society, how would it change us? In time both asks that question and then explores it well. The time as currency aspect is well developed and presented in a credible and detailed way.<br /><br />One problem with the movie however is that the world of In Time looks exactly like ours, I mean this film is set a couple of hundred years into the future. Now I do not expect them to have flying cars and robots, but you would suspect technology had developed some at least. Now I get it, the people in a position to develop new technologies are immortal so it would probably be some slowdown as no one would be in a hurry to get something done, but there have to have been some changes in 200+ years, even fashion is mostly the same. This was something which made it hard for me to suspend disbelief that this future would where exactly like our own except for people not aging and buying and selling time to live. Another thing I found unrealistic was the time zones, basically you have several cities with roadblocks between them to keep the rich and the poor separated, the problem is that there is 12 or so timezones and each zone seam to be the size of a city or so, ok but where is the rest of America, not to mention the rest of the world? Do they use the same system? Do they age, have they stopped aging and just let people live forever if they want? Do they use another system? None of this is even addressed in the movie. The would of In Time is completely limited to the 12 or so time zones and outside of that everything is a complete blank, something which is a little hard to buy.<br /><br />The acting in In Time is passable, you will find nothing fantastic here, the emotional scenes can seam a bit lacking which make it hard to care about the character, but for the action segment the actors get the job done. The music in this movie works to set the mood for the scenes it is in but it is forgettable. The camera work is quite ok. The characters in this movie is rather good, yes they are stereotypes, but they are well crafted versions of the stereotypes they are based on.<br /><br />I enjoyed In Time, it was an entertaining movie. At times the phasing is terrible and the movie feel a bit cluttered, it sort of make the story needlessly complicated which just leaves themovie feel rushed, but all in all this is a good movie. Now In Time will never be a cult classic, but if you like science fiction, and especially dystopian future stories then this flick might be worth checking out. There are always allot of okey movies between every time there is a great movie and this is a solid okey movie.movie feel rushed, but all in all this is a good movie.

0739383280|5.0|Didn't think it would ever be possible, but I think I love Poppy Wyatt even more than Rebecca Bloomwood. Yes, it's true. This character just wrapped herself around my heart and I'm totally taken. Such a cute story. And listening to the CD read by Jayne Entwistle only added to the charm of Poppy.<br />So many other people have told you about the story line, so I don't really need to repeat it again.... I just want to say that I think this may be my favorite Sophie Kinsella story... and I've read them all. I laughed and I loved it..... and I could not put this story down. When it was finished, well... my biggest hopes are for a sequel.<br />I highly recommend this story to you. I give it a big five stars!<br />JMHO  //(*_*)\\

B000FCKGPC|5.0|Fantastic continuation of the series. New plots, old plots, new characters, old characters. Love how the author usually drops an exciting tidbit at the end of each chapter. His writing is concise, and easy to follow, as usual. Looking forward to book 5 in the series.
0307957934|3.0|I will keep this short. I sat on the fence of getting this book. Then I went on vacation and I said, \\"Let me get this book as an easy, fun read.\\"<br /><br />I was expecting it to be about the hedge fund and then  for the solution to be a caper. But the book, without giving anything away, is about the fund. And if you work in any level of finance, the ending becomes kind of obvious early. That creates the problem that there is no twist.<br /><br />So you are left wanting to get a caper. How is he going to solve the problem? The solution isn't very exciting. Frankly the roll out of what is happening is kind of average.<br /><br />Nothing really happens ,and the guy who is the main character isn't likeable. No one is really likeable.<br /><br />While the author gets details about hedge funds fairly right, it was kind of pushing the boundries of turning into a sci-fi novel. and it chooses not to do that. but when it doesn't, he doesn't choose anything.<br /><br />Like I said, if you wanted to read this as a quick vacation read on the beach, do it. It reads fast and it reads like a movie. If you want it to be a great novel, it's not that.
0385333846|5.0|Like with Margaret Atwood's books, there's really nothing I can add to the torrents of praise for Kurt Vonnegut's work, including his seminal, funny, wry, unsparing, wicked, tragic, moral tale \\"Slaughterhouse 5.\\" [I read it a million years ago and thought I should reread it.]<br /><br />\\"Yo, yo,\\" said one, nodding dreamily. \\"Yo, yo.\\"<br /><br />The narrative keeps circling towards the firebombing of Dresden, in between visits to the alien planet of Tralfamadore, the last harrowing days of World War II, and suburban living in the years following.<br /><br />\\"They were catatonic with disgust.\\"<br /><br />We see most of these events through the eyes of the hapless and wretched Billy Pilgrim, a man as foolish as he is utterly human.<br /><br />\\"I hope that we'll meet again in a world of peace and freedom in the taxi cab if the accident will.\\"<br /><br />Mr. Vonnegut's unpitying prose is often luminous, always lancing. I'll leave you with this fabulous line:<br /><br />\\"Well, here we are, Mr. Pilgrim, trapped in the amber of this moment. There is no why.\\"
B00338QENI|5.0|Intriguing read that brought \\"inanimate\\" objects (cells) to life.  Author was able to weave a story that personalized the cells, and the reader felt the connection between cells and the person they came from.  Really good book.  Makes you think about medical ethics.
B005LAIGW8|5.0|Yes, this movie did cost less to make than the first, but you wouldn't know it if you saw it.  Most of the expenses of the first film were in the development of the cgi which was simply still being worked after already delaying the first film as long as they could.  This final tweaking of the cgi has made a huge difference and those who found themselves surprised at any disapointment they had over how boring such a realistic human skull could still be would probably enjoy another look.  The final tweaking one might sense was missing before looks to be there now.<br /><br />I've been a fan of this character as long as Nicolas Cage has been and I knew next to nothing about the actor or his other works til I learned he was going to play my favorite comicbook character.  So I'm able able to take his appeareace in this movie at face value.  (So to speak.)<br /><br />While I never cared whether whoever would play the role would actually look like Johnny Blaze I could only hope whether he had any idea what it was that made the character and story of the original comicbook work, as least for me.  When I heard he wanted to do a story with a DaVinci Code theme I wanted to dance around the room, especially since I had already just seen his work in \\"National Treasure\\", which impressed me even more than \\"Face Off\\"<br /><br />While the story in the movie is being protrayed more quickly and concisely then in the comicbook and therefore has some unaviodable changes, I believe I can still see tbe same basic plot elements I enjoyed so much in the orignal version, and if I'm not mistaken this is only the beginning of a rip-snorting, dares-you-to-think-outside-the-box tale, and what many people aren't saying is that this script was almost the one they went with the first time, *and* more in keeping with the original comic, much as I enjoyed the first film for looking like it otherwise still had those same basic plot elements.<br /><br />If most of what you know about religions in general and the history behind them is what you learned from the Media, past and present, and are smart enough to know it, then I recommend you buy this dvd so you can watch it again and again in the detail in which it was meant meant to be seen.  You might even notice some clues that could be hiding in plain sight.  At least I like to think so.  And if I'm wrong, I know I'm going to still have a lot of fun trying to guess what may happen next, cause it's that kind of film folks, and it's been way too long since I enjoyed paying to see any film over again while it was still in the theaters.<br /><br />My credentials?  Well, I've been around long enough to remember when the word \\"sequel\\" mean't \\"sequel\\", and you can take that for whatever it's worth to you.
0061122416|3.0|This short novel is a long parable. I finished reading it in 9 hours. Reading the reviews I found that there were considerable reviewers who found it to be profound and other reviewers who found it to be simplistic. But how do we explain that 65 million folks have read this small novel? The novel appeals to the idealism and expectations of youth. It does have a simple and explicit message that one must follow their heart and dreams, discovering their destiny on their unique life journey. Whereas this isn't exactly rocket science, this message must have had incredible appeal to the 65 million people who read this book and endorsed it so that others would read it. It is a product of our popular culture and the longings built into our modern existence. I found I understood all the many reviews I read. Those that were inspired by the book found something meaningful and those that hated the book often compared it to more sophisticated literature. The book is not for everyone but I am happy for those who had a personal insight due to reading the book. If I had read this book when I was 17 years old it would have floored me. At age 60 I found it sweet and simple. People search for guidance and insight and whereas I found none, that doesn't mean that it does not exist, especially for the 65 million folks that love this book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It is good but it does not yell you how to play. It does also have some fun games in it.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|I'll make this short and sweet. I fondly remember the Muppets from my own childhood, and after reading some of the many stellar reviews for this new version, I brought my 6 year old daughter to see it. Not that she wanted to...seeing as how she had no clue who this motley collection of puppets were, I wasn't surprised. In line to get tickets, I overheard other kids, with a familiar sounding whine, \\"But i dont wanna see the Muppets! I wanna see the Chipmunks...\\"<br />My daughter is one of those who HATES admitting when she was wrong about something, anything. But after this film ended, she had a new love. And as the days passed, the memories of the film grew stronger. I purchased the soundtrack on CD, and she was addicted. It was highly gratifying to see her demonstrate such wonderful taste! This is one of those rare 'childrens' films that plays just as well to adults, without talking down to kids. It's a fantastic film, and one of the year's best, kids or adults.

B006470HZ6|5.0|I hear a lot of complaints about the second season having turned into boring soap opera and not enough zombie actions.  It is true to some extent that the start of the second season may seem slow and yes, in the first a few episodes, we only got to see a few zombies get whacked for \\"shock values\\".  While I do agree there were fewer zombies than I hoped to see, this lacking in zombie actions in the first half of the second season are well made up for in the second half of the season.  So do wait for it; you will get lots of zombies.  Now about the show being boring because there is just bitching and moaning amongst survivors, I have to disagree.  Although I did want to see more zombies, the conversations and dialogues did keep me enticed. They were not just bitching and moaning.  They are studies into characters and their relationships which I find intriguing and captivating.  The reason is that I do like and do relate to them and that makes me care about them.  I think that in that sense, the show has done a good job, to have made me care enough to want to keep watching, because I want them to survive and keep surviving. Without the zombies physically appearing all the time, there are plenty of crises that will throw the survival of the group into jeopardy.  For example, what if Hershel really tries to have all of them thrown out the farm?  How will Rick handle the situation with wife, son, and unborn child's survival dependent on staying? It doesn't take much imagination the effect of unstable and explosive Shane thrown into the mix.  The situation is still tense and tittering on disaster which is of course compounded by zombies laying siege.  I am sure that even for those who are more about watching mindless whacking of zombies (eg Zombieland), if it wasn't for the survival of the characters, there would be no reason to watch the show.<br />In closing then, yes you will get more zombies later on but in the meantime, do have some patience to learn more about the characters; the wait will be worth it when real (I mean really real) crisis hit them on episode 12.

B004TRKH9O|3.0|I was disappointed with this CD - found it dull and boring.  Not up to the usual Tangerine Dream standards.  A bit mechanical and repetitive.  Skip this one and buy some of their other CD's.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|While the general \\"boy goes to magic school\\" plot carries unavoidable comparisons to Harry Potter, this is a much darker, gloomier book. It's well written, the descriptions really make the world come to life and the setting itself is nicely imagined and developed. Characters are interesting and fleshed out. Some parts are slower than others, but overall I would definitely suggest this to anyone who is into fantasy.
B003TNM2K6|4.0|I read \\"The Mist\\" in one of Stephen King's short story collections some years ago, and watched this film adaptation for the first time last year. The movie stays very true to the book, which means that it's a gut-punching horror. The monsters in the mist are only part of the problem as the viewer gets to witness the degradation of human psyche and civilization. That is the true horror here. Frank Darabont, one of my favorite directors, does a wonderful job here in eliciting such emotion from his actors, and this is a film that you will sit through the credits, mouth agape.

B000I2J6K0|1.0|When I first found out we were pregnant I was preparing to train for my first half marathon, had canceled by gym membership since I wasn't using it and was overall pretty active.  My goal was to keep up with this my entire pregnancy and to help me do so I decided to purchase a few prenatal DVD's to do at home workouts.  After looking over reviews of a number of prenatal fitness and yoga DVD's on Amazon I finally settled on three- one yoga and two fitness.  One of the fitness DVD's I chose was Prenatal Fitness Fix with Erin O'Brien which received 4.5 stars and 134 reviews on Amazon, making you think that it was a a great workout DVD.<br /><br />Well boy was I surprised when I first turned it on and it was nothing like what you would expect from the reviews or the cover.  The DVD is first of so out dated.  I felt like I was watching an old 80's workout DVD with awful music.  The picture quality was awful, the set up was dim and looked like it had been tapped in her living room one afternoon.  I also felt like the whole workout was something similar to what my mom used to do in our living room when I was a child.<br /><br />Well I did the workout a few times and just couldn't get into it at all, it was pretty awful.  Having apparently not learned my lesson this week I decided to try one more time but this time do the partner workout with my husband.  Well let me tell you it was worse than the regular workout.  Calling it a \\"partner workout\\" is stretching it a bit or at least it wasn't what my husband and I were expecting.  We were both expecting to get a workout, but instead the partner part of it was basically me using him as support or resistance while I worked out.  Honestly my husband was just about as thrilled to participate as her husband seemed to be in the DVD.  The partner workout really could have been done on your own using bands and a table or chair for needed assistance; it was actually more awkward to have my husband help me than anything.<br /><br />Overall this receives a 0 star rating for me.  I would not recommend this to anyone.all this receives a 0 star rating for me.  I would not recommend this to anyone.

B006OV7RQ4|4.0|Basically this is a movie about a young woman who runs away from a cult to go live with a sister who she hasn't talked to in years and her sister's husband.  It seems that Martha is genuinely terrified by the cult and has painful memories that fuel her paranoia.  Once with her sister, Martha seems to behave in ways that would have been acceptable for the cult but are just whacked out to the average person.  For instance, in one scene Martha curls up in bed with her sister and her sister's husband while they are having sex.  When they freak out, Martha replies that the bed was big and they were on the other side so she didn't think it was a big deal.  Martha's sister and brother-in-law take notice of Martha's increasingly odd behavior and are very concerned.  The brother-in-law and sister both seem to become annoyed with Martha, but her sister seems to feel some sort of obligation to her little sis.  Martha reveals nothing to either of them - she just drops hints of how she understands there are different ways of living, etc. but she never comes out and tells them of the sexual abuse she's suffered or the brainwashing.  Her flashbacks of life in the cult are vivid and the leader is extremely creepy, manipulative and sadistic in a matter-of-fact way.  Martha's paranoia eats her alive as she starts to believe the cult is looking for her.  It seems she has some sort of guilt associated with the fact that she has participated in leading other girls into the cult, drugging them, etc.  It also appears at times as if she's not quite sure what has happened concretely, as if reality has blurred into something that she's not sure is a memory or a bad dream.  She's so out of sorts that her traumatic past bursts through the surface ending in her sister and brother and law committing her to a mental institution.  Elizabeth Olsen is fantastic and plays the role of Martha with intelligence, cynicism, wit and beauty.  She's so believable if you didn't know this was a movie, you would think that she had actually lived through this.  There's no great surprise ending or dumb plot where the cult kidnaps her, but this is a very dramatic realist take on what could possibly happen to someone put in this situation.  Her mental breakdown is practically unavoidable, but you aren't certain if she even views it as such.  This movie was done well, but if you don't like artsy, cerebral dramas you probably won't enjoy it.  I'm glad I watched it and I hope to see Elizabeth Olsen in more - she has excellent potential.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As with the two previous books in this trilogy, I simply could not put it down.  In fact, I read the complete trilogy in three days and suffered a little eyestrain, but it was definitely worth it!  Readying Katniss, the protagonist, to be the face and voice of, as well as a soldier against, the corrupt government is exciting and suspenseful, with many twists and turns.  The unexpected ending shocked me, but I can truthfully say that all three books left me with a variety of emotions, and I thought about this finale a lot after I had finished it.  After my reflections, however, I am left with an intense feeling of satisfaction and cannot wait to read more by Suzanne Collins and also to see the movie!

B003O86FMW|5.0|I disagree with the reviewer whose opinion is that second books in a trilogy are \\"like treading water.\\"  This middle book is necessary to set the stage for the finale.  Like the first one, I could not put it down.  Katniss, the protagonist, is groomed to be the face of the revolution, whether she wants to be or not, by being coerced directly into another version of the Hunger Games, where she is once more fighting for survival with no hope of a good outcome.  This middle book has a lot of twists and turns.

B005K0HDGE|2.0|King had me through the first third of the book.  I thought he had finally won me over, but that didn't last.

B005FITIK0|3.0|From other reviews of the movie I thought it would be great. No doubt Theron is a fine actor and the rest of the cast was excellent, but I found the movie slow and a bit boring. Her attempts to seduce the guy she was after took a bit too long and I found myself fast forwarding to move the plot along faster. The saving grace was the crippled guy who was her confident; without him the movie would have been a real bore. I did like the symbolism at the end: her car with the front end smashed in representing the wreck of her scheme to seduce her High School beau.
B0021L8UPS|2.0|Sometimes a film will impress the heck out of me upon a first viewing, but then when I view it again later, it seems to fall flat and I find myself questioning what ever made me like it in the first place.<br /><br />I just rewatched this last night, and I must say that I am so surprised that I ever liked it. Ok, sure, it is well acted, well lit, and well shot, but the story is so preposterous it isn't even funny. Plus, it's edited very poorly, and has an entirely wrong feel for the story that is being told here.<br /><br />Yes, everything good about it, like the good lighting, color schemes, acting, etc etc, all work against the mere simplistic evil child storyline here. And nothing is ever really established as to any of the main character's motives. Yes, it shows that the mother suffered a miscarriage (in the over the top gory opening scene), but that doesn't really explain to me why they would want to adopt a child (who is almost fully grown, mind you), when they already have children. ?<br /><br />I could understand if they were childless, but they already have two children. Plus, if they really wanted another child, why not adopt a newborn baby? ? Anyways, enough about that lapse in logic.<br /><br />And, as for things not ever been really clearly established, well, that also goes for a lot of other scenes in the film. Namely, it is never explained (or fully explored) why the children react the way they do around Esther at school. Plus, the early scenes of little orphan Esther at school had me rooting for her, because it was the other children that came across as the bad seeds, and she was just some innocent outsider. And the whole scene in the playground, I found myself way too distracted wondering why the little girl was so afraid of the orphan girl, that it robbed the film of any form of suspense that it was trying to build in the moment.<br /><br />And the entire \\"bad seed\\" plot is kind of well forgotten by the third act, because the tone of the entire picture has shifted so dramatically that it in no way no longer really resembles what it was when it started. Plus, this was such a confused story. I don't mean confusing, but confused, in that it didn't really know what it wanted to be: Was it a thriller, or a horror movie, or was it an erotic thriller that happened to have the \\"good child is really evil\\" subplot? (Oh, yes, did I mention that this had way too many over-the-top erotic scenes in it that served absolutely no purpose what-so-ever.)<br /><br />And the entire thing was so way way way over the top it isn't even funny. Ok, well, maybe it is, but not in the way the filmmaker would want it to be. I found myself laughing at the movie so many times I lost count. And I was laughing at them, not with them!<br /><br />Everything is handled in such a heavy handed way, it robs the film of any genuine thrills it should have. There were some scenes that were shot so well, and so well lit, I could watch them over and over, if they were in another film. This may have been better serviced if maybe shot on a lower budget. ? But, as it is, there are way too many well crafted shots wasted on this kind of story.<br /><br />And don't even get me started on the father in this. He is possibly the most irritatingly stupidest character in all horror film history. And especially when he actually broke down and cried in front of the orphan girl, LMAO, how pathetic was that! I wanted to kill him myself!<br /><br />And that leads me to yet another problem I have with this movie (matter of fact, I had this problem the first time I saw it): The extremely over-the-top, gory, gruesome murder of his character. The way it was filmed made me feel like I was inside a snuff film, because it was just too gritty, and again, completely out of tone with the rest of the film.<br /><br />Plus, I almost felt like by that time in the movie, no more characters really needed to be killed off. It was such a blatantly bad decision in plotting in my opinion. And, then, this leads me to the extremely bad, over the top (notice a theme here, lol) ending. Wow, could \\"Halloween's\\" ending be ripped off anymore??? You know, the thing that would not die, no matter what you do to it, you know, like, stab it, set it on fire, stab it some more, shoot it, drown it, stab it some more, and IT STILL KEEPS COMING BACK FOR MORE!<br /><br />This is definitely a \\"shut your brain off at the start\\" kind of movie, and even kind of good for a first time viewing, if all you're out for is some kind of cheap, dumbed down quick thrill, but if you're like me, and like your movies to be a little bit more cerebral and challenging, then you may wanna skip this one. I sure wish I did! Thank you. :>). And, then, this leads me to the extremely bad, over the top (notice a theme here, lol) ending. Wow, could \\"Halloween's\\" ending be ripped off anymore???

B0063IH60K|5.0|I have always enjoyed playing this game. It is easy to play and download. I like being able to play by myself. This game is recommended by me!
B006PHD0RW|4.0|\\"Bag it!\\" is simply addictive, even though it gets really hard at times. The way that there are so many variations of \\"prizes\\" (3 stars and 2 awards) keeps me playing. Very highly recommended!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is one of my favorite mobile games.  Graphics are great on my kindle fire.  There is hours and hours of play time, and tons of replay appeal.  Each new world you unlock has a new innovative concept.  I love it and I'm 26 years old,  and my little cousin who is 5 spent an hour playing during dinner and i had to pry the kindle from her hands.  Wonderful game for a wonderful price.
B00005LC1H|5.0|A very funny, witty series.  John Cleese was hilarious! My sister told me about it and said that it was my kind of humor. She was right!
098478280X|5.0|Bought this book 3 weeks before interview. Read the book twice with careful hand-writing practice on each question. Got Amazon offer. The interview had 4 questions and one was in the book. The other 3 were not in the book. This book will not prevent you from getting new questions during interviews. But it does cover most of the common areas that interviewers are interested in. Once you are familiar with the solutions, you have the skills and confidence to solve new questions during interviews.

B006MOW98E|3.0|I picked this book because I was looking for something to read...<br />and then it started snowing I read this book in 2010 when it was really snowing here in MA and I was just loving the characters and the way that all the stories became one big one. I loved it. I still read it just because it's snowing outside... :)
0920236162|1.0|I purchased this on good reviews for a friend's birthday. I was shocked to read this. Bad behavior, characters poorly expressing themselves, social and environmental irresponsibility, and yes with elements of a dragon and a paper bag there should be some suspension of belief, but this was scientifically  implausible. In short, I didn't see any useful lesson or impact it would make on a small child. I didn't give it to the 4 year old for her birthday, instead after an attempt to return, forwarded it to a psychologist friend to get his insight.  I would not recommend.
B006X8GFBQ|3.0|This book describes great adventurers in the early days of space exploration, and their thrilling exploits -- How The West Was Won, or rather how the Solar System was won.<br /><br />Actually, it only hints at them. It's set 60 years after those great adventurers have packed up shop. The book leaves us to follow their grandchildren -- boring unadventurous folk, who lash out all too readily with pointless insults, who don't care for adventure or anything outside their small lives, and who get buffeted by fate like petals on a river. And almost nothing happened for the first 2/3rds of the book apart from long introspections and relationship dramas. I couldn't empathize with the characters, and don't know why anyone would write an entire book about them.<br /><br />I gave this book 3/5 stars. That's because the quality of writing is very good, and the sci-fi imagination of the author is top notch. He describes a near future with near-future computer and space technologies that are plausible yet astonishing, and he describes an exciting vision of space travel as we can imagine humanity doing it with limited resources.
1595827684|4.0|This is a must have for fans that have played through the entire Mass Effect series and loved every bit of it.<br /><br />The book is big and sturdy, with a thick hardcover, and durable, gloss finish pages that won't smudge or wrinkle.  For the Mass Effect 2 section, almost every squad member gets a full page artist's rendering that would be amazing as a 24 x 36 poster on a wall, but is still awesome to see as is.  The artist sketches typically cover brainstorming and development drawings, and even occasionally include comedic captions or side notes on what people were thinking.<br /><br />The book is a must have, and I don't regret the purchase one bit.  HOWEVER, that being said, I gave the book only 4/5 stars because, while lengthy, the entire Mass Effect universe is MASSIVE, and covers a lot of characters, aliens, locations, events, and ideas.  The book at least touches on most of them, but in a lot of cases, that's all it does (and for some reason, the Batarians aren't so much as MENTIONED in this book; big disappointment).  For those looking to find detailed developer thoughts behind the concept of various characters, aliens, or locations, you won't find much here; most captions and descriptive elements aren't much more than a paragraph or three in length.  This left me desiring a more information and background to much of what is shown.<br /><br />Still, this is an awesome book that shows a lot of early concepts of familiar races, locations, or vehicles in the Mass Effect universe; you'll see a lot of stuff that (sometimes, thankfully!) didn't make it into the game, including an enemy from Mass Effect 3 that got cut.  And some of the Mass Effect 1 information provided gives valuable insight into what inspired the look and ideals of the alien races.
145162445X|5.0|I wanted to buy this book, but unfortunately I had nothing, rather than something, in my pocket. But then I got the heads-up from Krauss that nothing is actually something. So what the hay, I put the book in my cart, but for some reason, Amazon wanted something rather than nothing. Long story short, I'm not sure I believe in Krauss anymore. What's necessary about believing in Krauss? What the Krauss am I talking about?
B004H1V5RU|5.0|If you love puzzles, have some patience, and are fairly dexterous, this is a great game! I would recommend starting with the original perplexus as it starts out at a pretty easy level and progressively gets harder. The Epic starts at fairly hard and just keeps getting harder!<br /><br />This probably took me 6-8 hours to beat each of the individual obstacles, and i've never beaten it all the way through in one go!<br /><br />A great game.

B004LWZW88|5.0|Watched this with the kids, I enjoyed it thoroughly, and the kids were glued to the screen as well. What i liked the most about it, is that it appeals for both adults and young ones, it was executed in a very professional manner, and was balanced just right to be suitable for both the old and the young.<br /><br />the movie is basically a tale of Puss' start, how he came to be, and the story behind his character, adding to it lots of action and adventure, and the movie never drags, with the right amount of pace.<br /><br />new loveable characters were added here, Kitty voiced by the charming Salma Hayek was an attractive and interesting love interest for Puss, but she is not your regular female cat as she has some very exceptional skills as well, think a Bond type if girl.<br /><br />Visually, it was spectacular, everthing was done so perfectly it appears so real, one of the best visually imoressive CGI films i have seen, the texture, the colors and characters, all done so professionaly, Bravo to the animators and people behind it.<br /><br />moebardi.blogspot.com

B007J4T2G8|5.0|It has been a while to read a book that I could not put it down for a few minutes and stayed up to read until the early next morning.<br /><br />It's erotic.  But, on top of that, that mysterious Christian Grey and the longing-for-love Anastasia Steele really made you want to know how their relationship would be.  Two people came from 2 completely different worlds.<br /><br />I can't wait to read Part II and Part III.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Quite a book. I have never read anything like this before. It was a page-turner and at was great because it was so different. It was erotic, sad and disturbing. I got invested in both characters and had to finish so I could know what evolved with them. He was complicated and I wanted to know what happened to him to make him like he was and she was a life-force, and turned out to be quite a strong character. Loved, Loved the e-mail exchanges. Made it quite relavent to today's world. I know this must happen in real life. We, women, do like to nurture and believe we can fix someone with our love. Will continue reading the next book in the series. EL James is a wonderful writer.

B000MDHJFE|5.0|One of the great pictures from the late 1950's. A magnificent performance by Jimmy Stewart and a story with no easy answers and a lot to think about. One of the many things I love about this film is that the Judge was played by Joseph Welch, the man responsible for bringing down the insane Senator Joe McCarthy (America's Hitler) a few years earlier. Just a great and stimulating movie. Eve Arden and Arthur O'Connell and of course Gazarra and the beautiful Lee Remick shine. They don't make 'em like this any more.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Easy to use with good page and graphics layout.  Use it all the time especially when headed on trips as it covers locations all over the world.
B004ZISVWC|4.0|What a cool movie...! Well Done! Obvious with other reviews, but I also thought 'Blair Witch' meets 'Cloverfield'.  That said, I would give those two movies a combined 2 star rating. (no disrepect, without those movies you could not make this one) Troll Hunter delivered where BW and CF fell way short IMO.  It didn't take long for the story to take shape and I was not dissappointed when things started gettin' interesting. Pretty well written and fairly original story.  A little violence here but it adds to the realism and is not just for shock value. The film also remains dramatic (not Rocky drama, but some drama) and very comedic at times. The characters were believeable and well cast.  The Trolls are so well done and were used to help the movie not dominate it. Scenery is way cool and hats off to the entire crew from this film! If any part of making this movie would have fallen short it would would not work at all, but it's just one of those films in which they all come together seemlessly.
1568363931|5.0|One reviewer said that you could get all these recipes on Ms. Itoh's web site. That's true, but I love writing in my cook books, making notes of what worked or what I'd do differently. Also, I loved the way she organized this book. The bento is presented box by box, or what we would think of as menu by menu. Then, she's provided variations of those recipes as if she was helping me by making her own notes of what she's done differently. Love the book and love the recipes!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really like this game, it keep you busy and its a great past time you don't even realize how long you've been playing.

B004I8WD7S|4.0|I bought this case a few months ago and have been very happy with it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Looks good in my opinion. It allows the industrial design of the iPhone to show through.<br />- Improves your grip on the phone. Just the right feel to make it easy to hold on to without being difficult to slide in and out of your pocket.<br />- Protects the front glass with a border. I don't have to worry about placing the phone face down.<br />- Excellent protection. I accidentally dropped my phone onto concrete from about four feet, the phone bounced a couple of times but came through completely unscathed, and so did the case. Not even a scratch.<br />- All the buttons are easily accessible.<br />- Price.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- There are some sharp edges from the molding. It would be nice if these were smoothed out.<br />- It's not very easy to remove or reinstall, so if you need to use your phone with a dock that won't handle the case you might want to look for another case.<br /><br />I can't comment on the screen protector. I tend not to use them, and when I attempted to apply the protector I ended up with a bit of schmutz between the protector and the screen, so I tossed it out. Not the protector's fault.

1600597963|5.0|I should have bought this book months ago. It would have saved me time trying to figure out how to do the beautiful stitching that I see on other pieces. Examples of the Jewelry pieces are high quality and the instructions with diagrams are easy to follow. I love the color pallets used in the designs. Some of the more intrique stitching techniques may be confusing for a beginning beader but for someone wanting to improve on their quality of work, this book is a Must Have!<br />Sherry W.<br />Euharlee, GA

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved this book, have recommended the series to several friends already! I can not wait for the film adaptation! - T C
B002XTXG1G|3.0|This movie is an arthouse masterpiece. It has the color, feel, intensity and show of high performance art but as a movie it just somehow misses the mark. Don't get me wrong the acting, directing and photography are here in epic and stylish proportions but any sense of actual storyline is swallowed up by quick film edits and theater.<br />  Tom Hardy is amazing and takes the role of the real life BRONSON, Michael Peterson, into the top tier of acting talent. He's that good. Peterson/aka Charles Bronson is Britain's most violent prisoner, which the film easily demonstrates but I'd rather have seen more of the actual dark journey involved than quick snippets and high art.<br />  I actually think that I liked the extras and commentary on the DVD more than I liked the film.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I bought this product a few months ago and it has made such a difference in my pictures. By angling the lighting, which you can rotate from 0-90 degrees, makes people look more soft. Plus the flash is very cheap compared to others. I am not a photographer so I just wanted a flash that I could angle that was not ridiculously expensive and this was perfect!

B004LWZW7Y|5.0|There was a time where I did not enjoy Animated movies. This has changed. Puss in boots humor throughout the movie kept me laughing from the start. Although there was a little bit of innuendo, the movie will be shared with the younger generation in my family... :-)

B0062NAX1U|5.0|I'm the type of mom who will 'lure' her family into watching something wholesome and good, otherwise they would all resist my good intentions.  I watched this movie with my husband first, who actually tear'd up towards the end - wow, never saw that coming!  I watched again with my 16 year old daughter, and she loved it, and then again with my 18 year old daughter, the one I had to coerce the most to watch it.  Luckily, the opening scene completely sucks you in, after that, the movie easily keeps you engaged.  LOTS of great messages in here, my goodness.  If only every home around the globe could watch this.  An excellent message, fitting for our times of dual-income homes and busy schedules.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The Star Wars set was a gift my son begged for but didn't think he would get. He was truly delighted with the great quality of the blu-ray edition. It was worth every penny to see the look on his face.
1932100660|5.0|This book came very quickly and the price was reasonable.  It was in perfect condition as well. It has great information and everyone should read it and decide if they want to continue the lifestyle they have or improve it dramatically.

1423140591|4.0|In many ways, this book is akin to its predecessors--if you've read the Percy Jackson series, then you know what I mean: gods, demigods, a titanic enemy, and a handful of otherworldly locations--but the story and its characters return with a renewed sense of adventure and a freshness that many tales, especially those written after a volume spanning five books, would envy. Percy is back and Riordan has found a way to keep his fans interested, involved, and, as always, praising the gods.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said by everyone else. This was just beautiful, brutal, awe-inspiring, and will put you into the stages of loss after it's over. It's a really important work that I can't wait to let my kids read (kids I haven't even had yet). This was so good that I'm still stuck in a post Hunger Games funk where nothing else compares. Sigh.
B006J420UE|5.0|This is great CPU, way better than expected.<br />Memory speed does matter a LOT. Between DDR3-1333 (10666) and 1600 is a huge difference.<br />Windows 7 x64 WEI is 7.3, 7.4, 5.9, 6.6 (!!!), 7.9 (Motherboard ASUS F1A75-M PRO, Kingston HyperX 1600 8GB).<br />I didn't buy 1833 because didn't want to deal with extra heat: maybe I was wrong. 1600 is practically cold no matter what you do.
0062112430|4.0|I didn't really get into the novel until Lena fell in love because only then did you really start to see her honest appraisal of this flawed society. Only then did you really understand that she was drowning already before she even realized it. The writing was excellent, though it took a while for me to get into it. By the end though, I was pretty invested.
B006ON41FC|5.0|it is a very fun game got get those nuts in yo mouth or else you wont get hit with the wood
006197806X|5.0|This was amazing! A lot of people did not like the back and forth between past and present, but I felt like it really balanced out the novel. It was a smart move by the writer, because had it been chronological, we would have been complaining that the first half was slow and not much action and the second half was rushed with romance. I enjoyed reading the present scenes of course, but in retrospect, the past scenes in the Wild were the bones of the novel. We must see how Lena is dealing with her grief to fully appreciate her growth, vulnerabilty, and true strength. It's how we come to love Lena.<br />The writing was beautiful, unsurprisingly. The author really excels in writing those last chapter sentences that give you closure and make you go, \\"Oh.\\"  SPOILER!!! Oh and when Blue died, that was sooooooooooo heartbreaking and beautiful. I love the line where Lena says that Raven left her heart with a small set of bones by the frozen river bank (something like that). Talk about ripping my heart out! SPOILER END!!!!<br />As for the romance, this is the first love triangle book I've read where I didn't know where my allegiance lies. Amazing follow-up, better than the first, can't wait for the third!

B000127LW2|4.0|If you're reading this, you probably already know what Voyager is all about, and whether or not you like it. Season 1, as with first seasons of most TV shows, finds the producers, writers and cast seeking their footing with the concept and the characters. Thus, it's one of the weaker seasons of the series. I'm OK with that -- they had to start somewhere. Four stars for the content.<br /><br />I take issue with the price. This season aired 17 years ago. It's only 15 episodes (all subsequent seasons featured 26 episodes, I think) on five DVDs. Why is it currently priced at more than $51 (a figure that randomly jumps to more than $60)? That's more than $3.40 per episode at the current price.<br /><br />In addition, the DVD packaging of the Voyager series is disgraceful and insulting to the legacy of the series. It's packaged as if the product was meant to be temporary and disposable, which makes the pricing even more frustrating and unfathomable.<br /><br />One would think that the first season would be most likely of all the seasons to be \\"value\\" priced in order to hook consumers into starting -- and continuing -- a collection of the complete series. Sadly, not the case here. A frustrating side-effect of this greedy pricing model is that Voyager box sets are one of the most bootlegged DVD sets you can find. Just try to buy new or used, supposedly legit copies on auction sites and you'll see what I mean. You'll probably spend about $20-$35, but there's no telling what you'll get for your money. If the price was reasonable for the official product, maybe there would be less of a market for bootlegs.<br /><br />Paramount should do right by the fans of Voyager and the Star Trek franchise, a franchise which fans have made one of the most lucrative in the history of entertainment media.
0439023521|5.0|I put off reading these books because I did not think it was much of a plot from the cover BUT I happened upon a clip of the movie and became interested!<br />Putting this book down was not an option at ALL. It took me less then two days(just finished) to read and I was impressed with how well it kept your attention as well as how plausable the whole story is to me.<br />A country broken and dominated by socialist types that use their power to keep segments of the population living hand to mouth, uneducated, and un armed to have better control. The mixing of technology and 3rd world living conditions ...it all made sense.<br />I am really looking forward to reading the next two books and watching the movies as well! I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of 14....but not younger. This story has A LOT of death and violence (that comes with that kind of government structure) as well as kids killing each other for the entertainment of the government, that I don't feel I would want my kids reading about any younger then 14.<br /><br />Well worth reading!

It provided ample topics for classroom discussion and introduced the students to personal and emotional issues they might not have considered without the stimulus of this novel. Many of the students found the novel's ending unsatisfactory even disappointing. Some said they felt the main issues were left unresolved.

B0045JEPXU|3.0|I really enjoy a lot of the modern electronic music, but I'm out of the loop as to what is good and what is not. As such, I rely a lot on the Amazon computer to analyze what I've purchased and viewed and to make suggestions to me. I never listen to the little \\"sound bites\\" they provide so almost every CD that I buy turns out to be something of a big surprise. That may seem haphazard, but I've found some really excellent music in this way. One of the latest Amazon computer suggestions was the \\"Planet Pit\\" CD by Pitbull. I'd never heard of Pitbull or this particular CD. That's okay, I can listen to and enjoy unknowns.<br /><br />One of my concerns about any CD, particularly in the field of electronic music. would be the quality of the recorded sound. Some electronic music has outstanding sound and some is atrocious. As a standard for sound quality, I listen to a few tracks on my \\"Random Album Title\\" CD by deadmau5 to adjust my hearing intake and my stereo system. I play it fairly loud and adjust the sound to come out crisp and clear. Then I put the Pitbull CD on. The \\"Planet Pit\\" sound comes across as fairly good, but not equal or ideal. It's a little too loud, for one thing. I like loud music, I might add, and I played the Pitbull CD at the same volume as the \\"Random Album Title\\" CD, but the Pitbull sound came across as uncomfortably loud. Evidently, the producers intend it to be that way, but I had to turn it down a notch for comfortable listening. Also, a lot of the sounds on the Pitbull CD are so blended together they come across as a pulsating sonic mush rather than distinctive and independent sound lines.<br /><br />I'm surprised at how hip-hop oriented the music is. Also, the East Indies influence surprises me, but I'm just not that familiar with Pitbull. That doesn't bother me any, it's excellent dance music and would be good stuff to play at a party. The vocals seem somewhat overwhelming. I should add that I prefer electronic music with a minimum of vocals. This recording has way too many for my particular tastes, and I don't particularly care for the involved lyrics, if I can understand them. Also, I don't particularly like the way the vocals are blended together as if everything is coming from one or two vocalists, which may well be the case.<br /><br />\\"Planet Pit\\" is not a bad CD at all. I can easily understand it's popularity. It's just not a good fit for my listening and musical tastes (more toward things like deadmau5 or Daft Punk), but that doesn't mean it's a bad record. I have problems with the production qualities of the CD, however, and it effects my listening pleasure in the negative.<br /><br />Gary Petersonhis recording has way too many for my particular tastes, and I don't particularly care for the involved lyrics, if I can understand them.

B004UXUX4Q|4.0|Yes, the story is worth telling (from a book by Kaui Hart Hemmings) and the study of contemporary family life with all its flaws is commendable, and yes, George Clooney submerges himself in a role that is anything but his usual romance hero roles, but it seems that the ideas presented could have been condensed into an hour long movie for television instead of spread over 2 hours of interminable Hawaiian music backed vistas of the islands. The film appeals to a lot of people and that is satisfying to note that movie goers care enough about end of life issues and flawed parenting skills to support the ideas buried in this extravaganza.<br /><br />Matt King (George Clooney though looking unkempt and sloppy is solid in a an introspective and subdued performance) is a real estate attorney who happens to be the controlling descendant in a family whose ancestors date back to the days of Hawaiian kings: the family owns a large parcel of land they plan to sell to become instantly wealthy, a move the Hawaiians find disturbing as the influx of commercialism would destroy the native beauty of their island. Matt's wife Elizabeth is critically injured in a boating accident and is in a coma, not only affecting Matt emotionally but also pointing up the fact that he must assume full parental duties in coping with his two rather outrageous daughters - Alexandra (Shailene Woodley in a career making brilliant role) and chubby troublesome Scottie (Amara Miller). He brings Alex home from the boarding school she has been attending in an attempt to make her less sociopathic (she has fought seriously with her mother, drinks to excess and behaves badly) but she come with her loopy friend Sid (Nick Krause, another fine performance) who ends up being not unlike Matt.  Alex tells Matt the Elizabeth was having an affair, a note that shocks Matt and sets him on a quest to discover who gained his wife's attention. When he discovers the boyfriend was a married real estate broker Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard) whose wife Julie (Judy Greer) Matt meets on the beach the attempt to bring closure to this portion of Matt's life, as Elizabeth is taken off life support machines, opens windows of communication between Matt and his daughters, with Sid who isn't as loopy as Matt perceived, with Elizabeth's parents (Robert Forster and Barbara L. Southern who embodies Alzheimer's Disease well), and most of all with himself. He gains courage to respect his heritage of Hawaiian land, dismisses his family's greed (from which Brian Speer would have benefited), and becomes an enlightened and emotionally more mature man.<br /><br />THE DESCENDANTS is a worthy film with a few good performances and a star turn for Clooney and Woodley, but oh, turn off that interminable Hawaiian music that drowns the story like a tsunami!

B0044RUSZM|4.0|I ordered the Griffin Laptop stand to elevate my 15\\" MacBook Pro next to my external monitor. It makes it significantly easier to do video editing on two screens when they're actually side by side. Considering the price, I was a little nervous about what the quality of the stand might be. Surprisingly, it's a very high quality stand in my opinion. It's made out of quality material, it is very sturdy, and it has guards on the end to secure the laptop a little more. It fits my 15\\" very nicely, it might be a little small for 17\\", and it matches the style of the Macbook wonderfully. The way it's elevated, it allows for me to place a couple of textbooks, a reading book, and a Kindle all underneath it in a very neat and organized way.<br /><br />So, here's what's good about this product:<br /><br />The Griffin laptop stand seems like a high quality, sturdy stand to me that also looks really nice. It has a \\"minimalistic\\" look to it (which I absolutely love), and it also has some grips on the end to help hold your laptop in place. The way it's built to elevate the laptop, it leaves a small storage area for a couple of textbooks underneath. It's also a breeze to assemble (more on this below though).<br /><br />What could make it better:<br /><br />Like I said this is a great product, but there are some areas where it could be improved. For one, the grip on the two metal strips could be a little stronger. They're not very \\"grippy\\". If it weren't for the guards on the end, I would be a little worried about the laptop falling off. Thinking back to the assembly, I think a little more support would make it more \\"secure\\" in a way. As it stands, you just slide them into place. Maybe adding a couple of screws would help this.<br /><br />Well, there you have it. It's a great stylish stand that's easy to assemble and fairly sturdy. It's definitely a great stand for the price.

0307956350|4.0|The Expats is the debut novel from new voice Chris Pavone.  It is a nicely written and paced spy novel that follows the story of an ex-CIA agent (Kate Moore) and her husband (Dexter Moore).  They relocate to Luxembourg on somewhat of a whim job offer for Dexter - an online security expert.  So they leave DC, and Kate trades the CIA for the expat equivalent of being a soccer mom.  However Kate and Dexter both have secrets as do the other primary characters Bill and Julia Maclean. The plot pinwheels around how these secrets come to light (what else were you expecting from a spy novel?).  If you want to know more of the plot, poke around the product page or other reviews.<br /><br />If you are still reading, you might be thinking, \\"Hmm.  I like spy novels, but I'm not sure if this one is any good or if I will like it.\\"  I can tell you that I do think it is a good (but not great) read.  Pavone deftly walks the line of spoon feeding information to readers without being obtuse or frustrating.  Since Pavone uses internet security as one of his plot drivers, it places the story very much in present day.  If you prefer something historical, this is not your book.  The Expats is not overly suspenseful, but it is more of an intellectual spy novel.  Readers will not find hair raising action in these pages.  The characters have average depth for the genre being neither paper thin or overly developed.  If you have a strong preference for linear storytelling, you may want to think twice about The Expats.  It starts in present day, and it intertwines present day sprinkled among chapters that tell the events of the past two years.  While is not my preferred style, I didn't find it overly detracted from the story.  Hopefully this gives you an idea of what The Expats is like, and you are better able to determine if it is for you.  If you are curious about other aspects, please feel free to ask in the comments below.<br /><br />Overall:  B+

In unenlightened lay terms -- why, for example, should predatory outside interests wrest control of a company from an ownership which does not wish to relinquish control - in a hostile takeover, in other words?<br /><br />These and a host of other economic, legal and historical issues centering on corporate control comprise the often complex subject matter of this particular volume, which should offer an engrossing treasure trove of information, insights and opinions on the subject to researchers and academicians in economics, company law and indeed, business studies.<br /><br />Part of Edward Elgar's estimable `Corporate Law' series, this publication in hardback brings together a selection of learned articles (all of which have appeared in authoritative academic publications up to 2009), by no less than 17 academicians, all acknowledged experts in this field.  Chapter 1, for example, contains the now famous article by Ronald Coase, which in part earned him the Nobel Prize in Economics.<br /><br />`His explanation of why firms exist,' explains  editor Fred S. McChesney, `has given rise  to a whole literature on the issue, much of which is reflected in  later chapters in this volume,'<br /><br />This, then, is actually an overview of what is essentially an evolution in understanding of corporate control function, described in the book's introduction basically as `triangular', i.e. - shareholders, management and outsiders seeking to take over the target company.  In the words of the editor the book does much to reveal `the extraordinary amount of work done concerning mergers and the market for corporate control...and the sea change in economists', lawyers' and others' thinking about corporate control transactions'.<br /><br />Here then, is much of the theory behind the practice of corporate decision-making and corporate governance, a great deal of which has influenced and will continue to influence the continuing changes in regulatory environments worldwide. If you're involved in any way with law, economics, or finance, this book will undoubtedly enhance your understanding of the forces and phenomena than can and do impact on company law.corporate decision-making and corporate governance, a great deal of which has influenced and will continue to influence the continuing changes in regulatory environments worldwide.

However if you are a practitioner, you may end up someday with a client who does own one, or indeed a whole herd of them.<br /><br />If your client's precious Dumbo or Jumbo runs amok one day, causing damage and injury, your client we fear is liable for such, even though the dear creature in question is normally as placid as a pussycat.  All this is confirmed and certainly explained in detail by the well known legal scholar, Sir Peter North, in this fascinating legal text recently published by the Oxford University Press.<br /><br />Note that this is the only book available which addresses itself to the harm done by animals (as opposed to the harm done to animals) - and covers both dangerous (the elephant) and non-dangerous (the pussycat) species -- either of which, given the circumstances, can cause harm.  The book would therefore be of particular interest to those dealing not only with wild animal cases, but also those cases involving household pets and farm animals.  For example, there is a chapter which deals with the special provisions relating to dogs and another on straying livestock.<br /><br />A former Principal of Jesus College and Vice Chancellor, of Oxford University, Sir Peter North refers in his preface to his earlier book on this subject, `The Modern Law of Animals' published 1971 at the time the Animals Act 1971 was passed. The Act itself as amended is included as an appendix.<br /><br />In the intervening forty years, the Act has generated any number of interesting decisions in the courts which, as is pointed out, `are now accessible, though not to be found in regular series of Law Reports'.  Of particular interest is the matter of liability for animals of a non-dangerous species.<br /><br />This is a clear, analytical and indeed rather compelling work, frequently enlivened by fascinating cases.  For your further research, it's copiously footnoted and there are extensive tables of cases and of legislation and of secondary legislation.  If you're a practitioner involved with any issues pertaining to liability for animals, (or perhaps you're likely to), this book is to be highly recommended as a must-have purchase for your professional library.

Its publication is indeed timely, especially in the UK in the run-up to the London Olympics in 2012.<br /><br />Part of a series of `handbooks', covering the latest research and thinking on international law, the book is a collection of learned articles (or `essays' if you prefer) from no less than 25 leading academics and lawyers worldwide and others directly involved in this field.<br /><br />The book meets a growing need for expert commentary and insight into the regulation not just of sporting activities, but all the related and often controversial commercial and personal issues including, for example, sponsorship, image management, intellectual property, the media and anti-trust regulation, as well as social and health matters such as discrimination, gambling, the protection of youth, anti-doping, field-of-play issues and of course much more.  Above all, there is the fundamental issue of fairness.<br /><br />The book focuses on two main `tracks' which are gradually converging.  One is the mainstream institutional framework of the law which includes the International Olympic Committee and other regional, national and international sports authorities. The other is the commercial sports industry, which we've alluded to earlier.  As the editors point out, `the best practices and processes for addressing such fundamental issues are becoming more uniform across national boundaries.'  The end result, we infer, would be more uniform national (and international) regulation and implementation.<br /><br />Worthy of note is the article by editor James Nafziger on International Sports Law, which among other things, provides an interesting historical perspective on the ancient Olympic Games which, then as now, were accompanied by law, in other words, rules which, would you believe, included the form of statues dedicated to Zeus.<br /><br />This is a thought provoking volume which offers much to learn from and enjoy.  For ease of reference, each article is uniformly structured, with, typically, an introduction, conclusion and extensive footnoting to aid further research.  The index at the back merely indicates the rich lode of information and commentary contained therein.  Anyone professionally involved with sport will value this book's contemporary and forward-looking approach to a topic which has now become a matter of global interest and concern.e is the article by editor James Nafziger on International Sports Law, which among other things, provides an interesting historical perspective on the ancient Olympic Games which, then as now, were accompanied by law, in other words, rules which, would you believe, included the form of statues dedicated to Zeus.<br /><br />This is a thought provoking volume which offers much to learn from and enjoy.

Should such private uses of copyrighted words be exempted from copyright, or should such users incur liability and certain penalties for copyright infringement?<br /><br />In the words of Stanford's Paul Goldstein in the foreword, `it will be fascinating to watch as future scholars apply this book's general methodology to the resolution for copyright law's hard cases.'<br /><br />As Goldstein asserts, this is a provocative book, which explores the ethical and moral obligations attendant upon copyright, both on the part of the creators, and on the part of audiences for which the creative works are intended.  Basically Ng envisages an `idealised community' in which the basic criteria behind copyright pertain to social justice rather than the mere protection of and proliferation of wealth.<br /><br />Those working in a European context who may be tempted to think that all this sounds very nice, but a bit California-ish, should be reminded that, for the present, California has certainly provided a sympathetic environment for the generation of more new ideas across a number of disciplines than anyone can shake a stick at.<br /><br />Yes, this is a book in which philosophical and ethical speculation meets copyright law.  But as we move on into a future of increasing globalisation where the only certainty is change, this book provides much food for thought and is definitely absorbing reading for anyone, from authors, to publishers to IP lawyers and IT folk on both sides of the Atlantic.

1469984202|5.0|Reading all the time and a lot of science fiction it was great to by accident find this writer. I read the 5 Wool books in one go on my Kindle. Looking at the price i first thought it would be bad, but I have to agree with the other reviewers, it is gripping, exciting and the use of language excellent. I have immediately bought the 4 Molly Fyd books and can almost not take the time to write this review.Hope there willl be more coming on the Wool series.It reminded me of the Logans' run series and Margaret Atwoods post apocalyptic books.My thanks to the other reviewers to recommend them.
B0034G4P4O|3.0|Fell asleep half way through.  Typical overdone Spielberg.  The CGI animation, and violence, are bit too realistic to render this a lighthearted animation feature.  Also, the \\"humor\\" was forced, silly and flat, IMHO.  Give me The Incredibles any day over this one.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read \\"Wool\\" months ago, really enjoyed it and wished it had been longer, but had no idea that it was part of a series.  Recently I was looking for new books to buy and came across the Omnibus and didn't hesitate to buy it.  I am so glad I did.  What a nice surprise, finding a self-published book without grammatical errors and typos!  It's shocking how bad some of the cheap books are.  Shameful, really.  Mr. Howey writes so well, paints a very colourful picture (pun intended - if you read the books you'll understand!) and his characters and setting are totally believable.  I am telling everyone I know to read this!  I so want to talk to someone about them.  I've just started book 5, and was worried that the ending would be a let-down, but other reviewers have said it wraps up nicely, which makes me really happy.  Must stop writing now and go finish it!
0812992792|5.0|Pay close attention citizens!  Turn up your loudspeakers which are in every household, every factory, penetrating every corner of life.  Let your amazement and disbelief at the story which is being unfolded before you double your productivity!  The imperialist dogs have fabricated a story about the poor, the tortured and the imprisoned of our workers paradise.  What a farce, for such things do not exist in the great nation of North Korea!  Out of the love of our Dear Leader for each and every one of you, are you not given ration cards for food while those poor citizens in the US must find food for themselves?  And what is this idea of torture?  Surely by torture, the dogs must have mistaken the meaning of your criticism sessions which are an implement of love, not pain.  For how can people live without correction and guidance?  Is it not the love of the Dear Leader which offers a guiding hand and an inspiration to us all?  And listen to the imperialist dogs talk about prisons when so many of their own are behind bars.  Yet in Pyongyang, no violent crime has occurred in years.  No, citizens rejoice.  Are your days not filled with the joy of productivity goals?  Are your evenings not filled with the joy of reading the works of the Dear Leader?  Do you not look forward to retiring in our special village with its white sands and blue ocean where you are no longer bothered by the demands of your children?<br /><br />And so the day begins in Adam Johnson's incredibly power story, The Orphan Master's Son.  Set in North Korea, the story follows the life of Pak Jun Do as he passes from one phase in his life to another in a society that devours its own citizens.  Despite the poverty, the hunger and the pain which affects him at each phase, Jun Do is rewarded by people around him opening themselves to him and persevering until the next phase begins.  The phases which go from being the orphan master's son to a soldier to a sailor and beyond also reveal more of Jun Do to the reader.  We learn that at one point during his career as a soldier, Jun Do endured pain therapy which allows him to compartmentalize pain.  Yet we are surprised by the brashness of Jun Do's actions and the cruelty of the state.  The reader gets the sense of what it would be like to live in a society where your activities that day, your thoughts and your hopes are not your own since they are constantly being changed by the will of the state.  We read about survival through ingenuity, but even then, the characters are beset by heartbreak all along the way.<br /><br />The minor characters are full of life and play major roles in the story by directing it and guiding it as they pass in and out of the story.  One of the most enduring minor characters is the Dear Leader himself who is felt on every page of the book whether he is mentioned or not.<br /><br />The description of survival in North Korea through ingenuity is interesting, but so too is the description of how the North Koreans see the citizens of the US.  This point is made when a delegation from North Korea visits a senator from Texas and during a visit from the senator to Pyongyang.  For example, the North Koreans are expected to be stunned at the idea that dogs in the US are disciplined yet the humans in the US are not disciplined through criticism sessions.<br /><br />The author's writing style is vividly descriptive and gripping.  The story is so engrossing that I found myself tearing through the story wondering what would happen to Jun Do on the next page.  In the book's afterward, the author, Adam Johnson explained that he was able to create such a detailed account of life in North Korea through painstaking research and an actual visit to the secretive nation.<br /><br />Overall, a troubling yet amazing story.  Be aware that there are scenes of violence and cruelty, but these are often fast so as to shock the reader by how commonly accepted these actions seem to be.  I highly recommend the Orphan Master's Son.

B007FDE4Y8|5.0|I've been looking for a relatively inexpensive video stabilizer for a couple of years now and finally, a reasonably priced, well built stabilizer is in the market.  The metal and plastic construction of the unit is quite robust and cameras mounted on the platform are easily balanced.  If you figure out how to balance them.  A single sheet of paper illustrating the function of various knowbs in the stabilizer is NOT enough!  An online tutorial would be welcome, but there is no indicator of the existance of such instructional material.  Fortunately, with some trial and error you can figure out how to balance the mounted equipment (but I had used another cheap stabilizer before, one that did not do the job as well as the SteadyVid Pro).<br /><br />In short, this is a very good \\"steadicam\\" unit, well constructed, but somewhat marred by inadequate documentation.  I suspect a lot of people will be buying the Opteka SteadyVid Pro.  It works quite well and is VERY reasonably priced.  With that in mind, a good manual or set of instructions (or even an online video or two), provided by the manufactuer, would be most welcome.

But this one, is so ergonomic and comfortable in my hand that it's almost as good as it would be if it was specially crafted for me. All the buttons can easily be reached and used.<br /><br />It is definitely worth the money I spent. I must also say that Amazon was really quick to send it to Turkey from US. I am happy I bought this mouse and would recommend it to anyone.

0802473156|4.0|This would have been an excellent 115 page book, but unfortunately it was puffed up to 205 pages. Gary Chapman kept going over the same points 3 times when we got it the first time.<br /><br />The basic premise of the book is that what shows love to you (your love language), and which you use to express your love, may not be something that makes your spouse feel loved (is not your spouse's love language). The books objective is to explain the 5 love languages (Quality time together, touching, acts of service, gifts, words of affirmation) and to give you guidelines to help you determine what is your love language, such that you can tell your spouse what would make you feel loved; and to determine your spouse's love language so you can be loving to your spouse in a way that will be meaningful to him/her.<br /><br />This makes a lot of sense in theory, but in practical application, those of us that tried it felt that while better than nothing, in real life, it isn't that simple. Most of us have more than one love language, and our love language can change based on something so trivial as how our day is going. Also we found there were other love languages such as sharing secrets.<br /><br />If the lessons of the book are applied, while not a total cure, you most probably will improve your relationship.

B000RZIGVS|1.0|We are Star Trek fanatics, so this isn't a review of the content - it's a review of this particular product.  I would concur with many of the negative things others have said about the shoddy quality of packaging, etc. but would add that we found nearly every disc to be unplayable.  We would be able to see one episode, tops, then it would freeze on us and refuse to read the rest.  Since our player works fine on other discs, I suspect that the poor quality of the discs is to blame.  NOT WORTH THE MONEY, don't be sucked into buying this like we were!

0307949508|5.0|Second in the late Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy, \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" further develops the promise of the first.  Readers are drawn even further into the secretive past of Lisbeth Salander, one of the most unique and refreshing heroines of modern fiction, as she fights to clear her name.  Readers are in for a wild, exhilarating ride as Salander and a surprising number of her friends try to solve a gruesome, twisted mystery.<br /><br />The novel picks up almost a year after the first novel, with Lisbeth having cut off virtually all communication with anyone who might have been her friend.  She has spent a year traveling and returns to Sweden quietly, establishing herself in a new luxurious apartment, and staying as far away from Mikael Blomkvist as possible.  Meanwhile, Blomkvist and the staff at Millennium are about to publish their second book, an unflinching expose of the sex trade industry that fingers several police officers.  Things are definitely looking up for Millennium, but when the author of the forthcoming book is found gruesomely murdered, the tables are turned once again.  For Lisbeth Salander's prints are at the scene and suddenly she is wanted for three counts of murder.  As the police try to figure out just who Salander is (based on contradictory reports), Blomkvist sets out to clear her name, knowing that there is no way she could have murdered his friend.  But since Salander gives him little evidence to go on, and the police are intent that she is the killer, he must conduct his own investigation which leads him and the reader into Salander's childhood and why she is under guardianship.<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" is a book that is hard to put down.  The story races along, especially when Salander disappears for nearly one hundred pages after the heinous murders.  It makes readers wonder about her guilt or innocence, especially considering who one of the victims is.  Stieg Larsson managed to mix aspects of a thriller with social commentary that makes these novels unlike anything else out there today.  The revelation of Salander's past is not quite what I would've expected, but it is unique and fitting to the character.  Unlike \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" the mystery in this one is not easy to solve.  And the novel closes with a bang that will make readers want to immediately read the concluding novel.with social commentary that makes these novels unlike anything else out there today.

0897502027|4.0|The book is a great read for those that are little interested in the martial arts or who have great knowledge of the art. It shows the great mind of Bruce Lee and his many ideas,thoughts and philosophies, which at times could confuse the reader. The reader must remember the author was speaking in various aspects of a person views. Lee tries to let the reader understand its not always about the set of rules,regulations and routines but rather which you as an individual can utilize the best for yourself.  Overall this is a great book and remember to have an open mind about philosophical views that maybe quite different from yourselves.

When will they stop raiding my car?\\"<br /><br />Another guy says, \\"My mama always told me that I'd be good at somethin'.  I bet what she didn't know was that that somethin' was zombie huntin'.\\"<br /><br />They meet and he adds a few new rules.<br /><br />Rule 1: Cardio.  You wanna run away, gotta be quick on your feet.<br />Rule 2: Double-tap.  Shoot 'em once in the stomach, once in the head.<br />Rule 3: Always wear your seatbelt.

Katniss should be relieved, happy even.  After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale.  Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be.  Gale holds her at an icy distance.  Peeta has turned his back on her completely.  And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta  may have helped create.  Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop.  And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try.  As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel victory tour, the stakes are higher than ever.  If they can't prove, without a shadow of doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.<br />(From the dust jacket)<br /><br />27 chapters<br />391 pages

B004J1DBJI|2.0|I am impressed by the Wolfram Alpha search engine and the results it presents for several queries I made.  Unfortunately for me the results are barely readable due to the really small type for most of the data presented (you can't zoom out to enlarge the results page on the app). Perhaps the problems I have with the app are specific to my Samsung Galaxy Note smartphone (not the tablet), and probably other android phones with HD screens as well.<br /><br />However, I do know my problem is with the app. I did similar queries on my Note using the Dolphin HD browser, which picks up the Wolfram Alpha mobile web site, and renders essentially the same search results in a fully acceptable and readable manner.<br /><br />I bought the app and I'll keep it, but I'll use Dolphin for Wolfram Alpha queries until the legibility problem I'm having is fixed (soon I hope!)

6305428298|4.0|LV lives in the shadow of a bosterous and demanding mother, Mari.  This experience has turned LV into a pathologically quiet and subdued young woman, who doesn't leave home, and finds enjoyment only in listening to and singing along with her vinyl records.  One day she is overheard by Mari's date, a small-time promoter, who decides LV is his ticket to the big time.  LV agrees to do one show, and blows away the audience.  What happens next defines all the characters in this movie.<br /><br />I'd rate it PG.  Expect great acting (especially Michael Caine in an unflattering role), and an entertaining story.  But this is no Cinderella story; things will not turn out as you expect.
B003V9OCIS|5.0|This was a beautiful film and I would recommend it to others, especially if you are in the process of learning German. I had a few problems myself with the language, but I can't say if that was due to my misunderstanding or to the dialect (I think it was Bavarian).

I heard about it before, but never really bothered to try and watching it until it's last season and was surprised that it was actually a decent show and made me want to actually watch 1-7 to see all of Jack Bauer's Struggles.<br /><br />I then noticed that seasons 1-7 were availible for Prime for free, which allowed me to watch every season on amazon, which took a few months watching a few episodes each week.  This was nice because I mainly hate waiting each week to see the next episode, and now I was able to watch a whole season in less than a week (If I Had The Time).<br /><br />While many things in this series such as the circumstances and outcomes are not the most realistic scenarios, it still kept me interested and wanting to see what came next!
0345535421|5.0|The comet streaks across the sky of the fractured Seven Kingdoms.  A comet the color of blood and flame cuts across the sky.  The six prime rivals for the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms interpret the bloody fiery trail to fit their needs.<br /><br />Once the heir apparent, Stannis believes the comet means the time to attack Westros with sorcery and an army is now.  In King's Landing, teenage King Joffery proves a poor abusive monatch leaving his uncle Tyrion the King's Hand to protect their subjects.  In the north Tyrion's father Tywin battles against Stark and her militia while another son Jaime is a prisoner of war.  From the South, Renly needs to eliminate his brother Stannis before he begins his assault on King's Landing.  Finally in the distant east, resolute Daenerys leads her Khalhaser dragon horde towards Westros.  The various hostilities by rulers against each other turn the Seven Kingdoms into a chaotic lawless land<br /><br />The second A Game of Thrones fantasy (see A Song of Ice and Fire) is a superb entry in which political and military alliances mean little as ambition to sit on the Iron Throne remains everything for most of the competitors.  The innocent are collateral damage as their plight from marauding soldiers and vicious outlaws are meaningless to most of the pretenders.  Loaded with action while rotating effortlessly perspectives, the aptly titled A Clash of Kings is a powerful tale.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

B0058YPG1G|5.0|I would like to counter those that complain. First trouble with Amazon and devices have nothing to do with the program. Complain in the right place - if you would like proper feedback and/or help. Second this program is called Breaking BAD - not getting better, or learning my lesson and not being BAD any more. Third, Walter White (ironic name, yes?) is getting badder by the moment! I cannot wait to see the final season of this amazing journey down the rabbit hole. Fourth, how can a person interpret any of this program as pro-meth smoking? The depiction of Jesse and friends and others that partook of the blue crystal was nothing short of horrific - there was no romantic under-current. Take this show for what it promised to us all. White falls from grace and with him he \\"takes\\" a wife that thinks - like her husband - she is smarter than those around her and a damaged self-loathing and lost young man. What will the writers show us in season five? I am on pins and needles - looking forward.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is one of the most epic and suspenseful books I have ever read! I think people 12+ should read this book because you can`t stop after you read the first and second books!!! :) SO GOOD!!!
145551389X|5.0|The pictures are great to see.  There were also a lot more pictures than I had expected.  This makes a great gift item too.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Perfect way to start and end your day. Very convenient. I enjoy having the Bible at my fingertips when I want to have my cup filled.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Such an intense book! Not as great and fascinating as the first book but just as well written. Suzanne Collins is one of my favorite authors!!!
B004EPZ03O|5.0|This Muppets film has to be my favorite film of 2011. I was so surprised by how much I enjoyed it when I saw it, as I had never really seen a Muppets movie previously.<br />The songs were really catchy (definitely buy the soundtrack too, I can't even count how many times I've played it) and the movie itself was charming and hilarious. I can't recommend this movie enough.
B0000E6XH3|4.0|As a 12 year old boy, ( and an insane daft punk fan) This caught my eye. I searched FOREVER online to find this, and I did. I watched it. About 5 minutes in, I was sold.<br /><br /> First of all, the animation is AMAZING, with great colors( though slightly outdated) and the sonds were clear.<br /><br /> By seeing the layout for the album Discovery (soundtrack) it was clearly intended for the movie.<br /><br /> But again as a 12 boy, the move is reletively forgetable, and the songs Nightvision, High life, and Something about us (I prefer the edit on the album Daft Club) are time wasters.
0812992792|4.0|While I had to figure out what was going on at times, once I got the hang of the author's writing style, it was fascinating. I kept \\"google\\" close because there were things that I wanted to verify as an accurate possibility...sadly, the author seems to have done his homework. The characters are not the good guy/bad guy stereotype, but allow the reader to be empathetically conflicted-much like human nature truly is without any pretense. Very well done, thank you Adam Johnson.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved it,everything about this and the two follow up stories, ... the only other series I've read that quickly was Twilight, but this was different, not better, not worse...  If in doubt try the first story... Christian is HOT (& not a vamp in sight!) I hope the author writes more and soon... I might expire without it!
B004I744AS|5.0|Very useful and helpful.  Ive tried other dictionary apps and this has been the most accurate<br />  It is quick and to the point.
B000008JUM|1.0|This CD was produced for a laudable cause but is lacking in every other respect.  It brings to mind something Sir Winston Churchill once said, \\"This pudding has no theme.\\"
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Loved it! Very fun app that looks great on the Fire. Definitely recommended for anyone that loves puzzle games. Get it!
B006IGZWB2|1.0|Yawn.....Watched the first hour and gave up so save your money for a better one. I do not nderstand the high ratings for this SLOW moving film.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|The first watch arrived broken, watch returned and replacement received. The new watch worked twice then the buttons fell out. This watch appeared very badly made. I requested a replacement.<br />It was a little complicated to use but if your good with electronics then that should be ok. But if your paying that Mitch for a spots watch then it should be a lot better quality.
B000X107GI|5.0|Purchased Maxell CR2032 batteries on Amazon from Best Deal Supply came very quick and were fresh Dated 12-2016. Excellent Batteries for my Red Dot sight!
B00395ZYVS|5.0|This is a wonderfully written book that while at times comes across as obviously fiction is also very real in it's portrayals. An enjoyable read for winding down this book had me  smiling at times and crying at others. A brilliant portrayal of the economic inequalities that exist in India.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Going into this book, I was expecting a complete ripoff of Battle Royale, but censored to appeal to Americans and young adults. I was only partially correct. Yes, a summary of the book is pretty much a summary of Battle Royale, and The Hunger Games isnt nearly as sadistic or violent, but the similarities pretty much stop there.<br />While Battle Royale was simply a social commentary on government control, The Hunger Games takes it one step into modern society and adds commentary on the ridiculousness of reality television.<br />All in all, I felt this was a 3 star book, but to be fair, I would have enjoyed it more if I hadnt read Battle Royale first so I added a star for that reason. Overall, Battle Royale is the better book, unless you cant handle dark, sadistic violence. Given the subject matter of children being forced to kill each other, The Hunger Games is a little too feel good, but it succeeds in bringing the social commentary of Battle Royale to a wider and younger audience, and thats a good thing.

B003YUC9JI|3.0|I still do not understand why Amazon does not separate the blu-ray reviews from the Standard Def reviews or why some reviewers can contribute nothing but script synopsis and summary.  It is the quality of the discs audio and video that is a deciding factor for me, though interesting extras such as deleted scenes, extended versions and such are also important.<br />I found that this very fine remake of the Karate Kid film to be just that, an engrossing film that, while not quite containing the intrigue of the original, never the less stands on its own.  In the original the bullies were ever present.  In this remake, they disappear after the beginning of the film and only reappear at the film's finale.  The whole of the film is in Jackie Chans training of his new student. That's as much of the story line as you will get from me.<br />The video quality itself is very good, not excellent, but very good.  Beautifully shot but the cinematography wisely avoided having the colors pop too much so that you don't feel you are watching a cartoon.  The audio quality is almost entirely on the center speaker.  The front left and right channels are used only for the musical score and rarely are the rear surround or front left and right channels used for any of the foley effects.  I said rarely, not never.  In one scene firecrackers going off are steered to the left rear but we are talking of a second or two.  Crowd noise during the tournement should have utilized all channels but never did.<br />The extras are interesting but, if memory serves me correctly, there were many more on the original DVD release.  One in particular that I recall was how the snake charmer scene was set up and filmed and that is missing from the Blu-ray version.<br />An enjoyable film that does not meet its presentation potential on Blu-ray.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksthis review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B002BJGYUS|1.0|I was very upset when I received my copy of the first season of Gilmore Girls. The case was shattered when I opened the mailing package. They need to learn how to send things correctly.
B000OPOAJS|4.0|I have always felt that Ronin was greatly under rated as both a fine film and great acting by DeNiro whose more recent films clearly show him to have become a caricature of his own persona.  I have watched the standard version of Ronin several times and have finally picked up the Blu-ray edition.  Unfortunately, the Blu ray version has no extras while the original release had alternate endings and others.  The Blu-ray versions audio makes excellent use of the surrounds both front and back where appropriate though there is little use, if any, of the subwoofer when, clearly, there are many opportunities for it.  That perplexes me to no end.  The car chases are some of the most exciting and unique found in any film and have a very real purpose.  If the mulitple  cast of characters who contribute to the various sub plots and mysteries are sometimes a touch confusing, the 'silver case' is reduced to nothing more than a prop for the world of Ronin to surround around.  One never finds out exactly what is in that case but that is not even important.  The video itself is of 'okay' quality.  Nothing wrong with it, no artifacts, no issues but I see little difference between it and the original DVD release.  As I stated, the audio is excellent tho the lack of sub usage is criminal and, for a movie of such action, the audio becomes more important to me than the video with its muted colors anyway.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B004EPYZSU|1.0|This is not a review of the movie itself, but a review of the blu-ray. I would give it zero stars if I could. This did not work AT ALL on my blu-ray player. The movie would not play at all, it just kept jumping to the Extras screen. To add insult, the Extras wouldn't play either--just an endless loop of waiting for menus to load and never being able to see any video. A frustrating half hour of reloading and re-trying before I finally gave up on it. Do not buy this buggy disc. If you like the idea of sci-fi mixing with western, try the Firefly blu-ray instead.
B006P0FIB0|1.0|Was lookin forward towards watching this movie bc the previews lookd real good and it was in 3d, well now I wish I didnt waste my time or money,the story and fight screens r boring and nothing special and the 3d was horrible and the biggest thing I hated was there was the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen and if anybody knows 3d thats a big no no bc u focus more on the lines then the actually movie,
B007JF87VS|2.0|What is crazy is both the way this show has simply gone no where since the beginning of the season, and how much the positive reviewers ignore the obvious bad writing, bad acting and silly repetitious plotting. It's like General Hospital with the addition of a weekly zombie or 2, where no one speaks like humans, they just stage whisper because Hollywood thinks that shows powerful emotion. I'm sorry, this show has just gotten embarrassing. At least they finally followed the books and killed off the main cause of the redundancy, the Shane character. It's about a season and a half too late, but progress is progress.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|The movie is ok but the use of 3d is fantastic,from the first screen to the end,you see all kinds of things popping out at you and the depth is amazing,wish all movies where this good
B0076NKLRQ|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this movie from start to finish.  Michele Williams is superb as Marilyn and everyone else associated with the film are perfect in their parts.  I definitely want to watch this one again...
B00701897I|1.0|I figured I would buy this bc it lookd fun and was hoping for some good 3d,boy I was wrong,i turned it off half way thru and the 3d wasnt good at all,and had the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen,if you want to see a fun movie with amazing 3d go buy jouney to the center of the earth,prob one of the best 3d movies out there
B004ZISVWC|3.0|I feel it could have been much much better, but for a drive-in type movie it is passable.  I was disappointed.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|I love this app. i spend hours at a time playing. I even go back and try for lower times on previous levels
B007BDK3SS|2.0|D2 cannot play this thing very well and makes me want to poke my eyes out with a nerf gun.  not very optimized for single core phones.  that's the way it is these days.
B005FITIK0|1.0|I don't know what movie the other reviewers saw but this movie fell short on so many levels that I hardly know where to start.<br /><br />I really tried to like it but the creepiness of the character and the lack of laughs just made this movie painful to watch.  I went into it with high hopes of finding a funny character with all the neurotic quirks that are unique to writers.  In fact, the only redeeming part of the movie would be recognized by writers is when Charlize Theron's character starts exhibiting writer's block near the beginning of the film and finds herself unconsciously looking for distraction to avoid writing her daily quota of words and/or pages.<br /><br />I have to wonder if the critics who professed to love this movie only wrote the reviews out of kindness to Theron in a failed attempt to gain her attention as if they were back in high school and she was the popular girl that batted her eyes at them, leading them on but only because she wanted something that only they could provide, and discarding them back into the Dungeon of Dorks as soon as she got it.<br /><br />Don't waste 2 hours of your life watching this film.  Better yet, go find something useful to watch or do but, for God's sake, don't waste your precious time on this dog of a movie.
B0071QIN00|2.0|D2.  like the other trials it is not very good to play on a single core phone.  terribly sluggish.  I would rather watch snails mate.

When Poppy loses her engagement ring, she panicks and while she is  trying to call the police, someone sneaks up behind her and steals the phone right out of her hand! Now what to do? So she sees a phone in a nearby garbage can. She borrows it which sets off a chain of life changing events! She saves a company, and shakes up her love life. This is a keeper! I couldn't put it down!
B003O86FMW|5.0|i love this book. i honestlythink it is better than harry potter. this book shows friendship, trust, and, at one point, the importance of cpr. it also shows violence, torture, and mistreatment. i can't wait till march 23 for the movie

0312641893|5.0|Sixteen-year-old Cinder Linh is a cyborg. Part human, part machine, she lives as a second class citizen in the commonwealth of New Beijing, hundreds of years after the end of World War IV. Her stepmother, Adri, and stepsister, Pearl, are cruel. Constantly berating her and reminding her of her place as a metal monstrosity, Cinder's only comfort is in the affection of her kind stepsister, Peony, and the family's quirky but loving android, Iko. After her stepfather's death years earlier left the family penniless, Cinder works as a mechanic in the New Beijing marketplace, fixing broken androids, hovers, and portscreens. Cinder is shocked one day when Prince Kai, the only son of New Beijing's emperor, visits her shop with an old android that has stopped working. Cinder is puzzled as to why Kai would not take the droid to a royal mechanic, but suspects that it contains confidential information and agrees to fix it for Kai. What Cinder doesn't know is that letumosis, a deadly plague that has killed hundreds of thousands in New Beijing alone and has infected Kai's father, Emperor Raikan, is going to claim another victim: Peony. Inexplicably blaming Cinder for Peony's contracting the disease, Adri sends Cinder to the palace to be a part of research conducted on cyborgs to find a cure for letumosis. As part of the antidote experimentation, Cinder is infected with letumosis so that her body's reaction can be studied. What happens changes her life forever: it appears that Cinder is the only citizen of New Beijing who is immune to the plague.<br /><br />Fun and inventive, this first installment in debut author Marissa Meyer's Lunar Chronicles is an entertaining start to what is sure to be a popular series for young adults. Set in the futuristic commonwealth of New Beijing, Cinder weaves a complex but engrossing plot, creating a cast of characters and story that is sure to last through the remaining novels in the series. As the title implies, the story is a very loose interpretation of the classic Cinderella tale. The evil stepmother and stepsister are present, as is the ball, and the handsome prince. Cinder herself, however, is far from the beautiful yet demure servant in the Disney version. A tough cyborg mechanic, Cinder doesn't swoon at the feet of Prince Kai, nor does she take the abuse she is subjected to lying down. Cinder is determined to escape her stepmother's house, even going so far as to restore an \\"ancient\\" gas-powered car to do so. The addition of the plague to the novel also veers the plot away from the traditional fairy tale. The fear of letumosis is something that permeates the story, creating tension that readers who have experienced a chronic illness in themselves or a family member will certainly identify with. Danger from the Lunars, the inhabitants of the moon lead by the beautiful but evil Queen Levana , adds another intriguing element to the plot. Overall, Cinder is a thoroughly enjoyable debut novel and can be easily enjoyed by a variety of young adult readers. The second installment in the Lunar Chronicles, Scarlet, is set to be released in 2013.<br /><br />After reading many novels that have a great premise but poor execution, I was worried after reading what Cinder was about that, with such a strong and interesting idea, it might fall victim to the same fate. Fortunately, this is far from the case! Cinder is a truly enjoyable story and I was very impressed with Marissa Meyer's skills as a writer after diving into the intricate world she created. The part of the novel that I found the most intriguing was her descriptions of the Lunars. Their back story and the character of Queen Levana are very interesting, and I'm looking forward to seeing what happens with that the most as the series continues. I am chomping at the bit for Scarlet!<br /><br />Like my reviews? Check out my profile for a link to my blog for more recommendations!ion of the classic Cinderella tale.

B0050DIWFC|2.0|This book lacks the excitement and suspense it could have had by being drawn out and tedious. It could easily have been half it's length.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have the Samsung Galaxy Nexus which is a very high end phone and can play much more graphic intense games without a fluke. such as Modern Combat 3. So why is it that when I want to go play a simple game like this it freezes all the time!!! I'm am very unhappy with this app. and I am totally willing to give five stars for this if it is fixed.<br /><br />Bottom line: don't buy this app if you have the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. unless they update it to work. this is just so ridiculous....<br /><br />EDIT** it is now fixed five stars as promised!  Great game.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|App is amazing..love this game but ill never payfor an app from amazon they are always outdated!  I only download the free app of the day when they are good
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I first read the discription of this series. Honestly, the only reason I even took a chance is because it was available in the omnibus edition and I figured I couldn't beat the price. I found, once started, I had a very hard time putting it down (except when my battery died in my Kindle Fire). I would have given the review more than 5 stars if that option was available.<br /><br />P.S. This would make a great movie!

B000JQU1VS|5.0|You can't argue with a classic! The old days where adventure novels were factually literature and not simply cheaply thrown together tall-tales written exclusively purely for the purpose of turning pages and making money.

0736083863|5.0|As a Pilates instructor, I have bought many anatomy books, textbooks and dvds over the years, all with merit but none that specifically address Pilates anatomy with such accuracy and profound insight.  This is it, folks!  Not just an anatomy textbook, this comprehensive book gives you an in depth understanding of over 45 mat exercises, including step-by-step movement and breathing instructions, modifications, technique cues, muscles used and insightful side notes, not to mention the wonderful illustrations showing the proper form and activated muscles used for each exercise. Whether newbie or seasoned pro, no matter where you are on your Pilates journey, you must have this book!  Thank you, Rael and Karen, for such an amazing gift. I hope this is just the first in a series that will also include the apparatus as well!

There are alot of ups and downs and you really never know what is going to happen until the very end. Reading a book this old makes you wonder why writers don't write this way anymore. They probably should. I recommend this book to anyone, especially if you can get your hands on an old copy like mine.<br /><br />Peter Moore - Author of Copyright and Skip-Trace
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I can not put this book down. My husband reads it over my shoulder. I want to sneak away to the bathroom and read it while I'm at work!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think its a pretty good game. I like playing it. I can play it for hours without getting board(:
B003Y5H5B0|4.0|I had a bad feeling going into 21 Jump Street. I never watched the original series and I'm not a fan of Channing Tatum (nobody really seems to be who isn't a woman). I also really disliked the last comedy Jonah Hill was in (The Sitter) since it just felt like a rehash of everything he did before it without offering much of anything new. With all the trailers, clips, and red band media from the movie hitting the web, it felt like I had seen the majority of the movie going into it anyway. Then there was the co-worker who went to an even earlier screening and swore on its massive hilarity. How often does that work out in a positive light? \\"Some guy I sort of know said this was really funny!\\" Then you go see it with high expectations and anticipation dripping from your armpits and it turns out to be about as amusing as a moldy loaf of bread. That invisible type of mold that looks fine until you sit down to eat it in a sandwich or as toast or something and then it just tastes like you're licking fresh algae off of a wet rock. Fortunately, this didn't go down quite like that.<br /><br />The first thirty to forty five minutes are pretty much ruined and spoiled by the trailers. The F-word is thrown around quite a bit and random people are dry humped to bridge the gap between the clips you have seen, but things don't begin to look up and feel fresh until Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) take the HFS drug. Maybe Channing Tatum has just been type casted into the wrong genres his entire career because he was downright hysterical. His \\"F--- science!\\" and band practice scenes while on HFS will have you in tears. Jonah Hill delivers exactly the type of humor you've come to expect from the recent Oscar nominee and is pretty funny, but it feels like Tatum has made this huge breakthrough in comparison.<br /><br />The chemistry between Hill and Tatum is also a pretty big selling point. The movie relies on the two of them to work together as a team or at least create classic moments together and it works in ways you can't even begin to imagine. Their past, their assignment, their fights with one another, and the way they both seem to get in too deep make their friendship all the more believable and extremely entertaining to watch. The scene when they're trying to make each other throw up not only shows how close they are but illustrates how hilarious they can be together.<br /><br />21 Jump Street has this element of unexpected; laugh out loud hilarity buried underneath all of the clips you've seen in the trailers. While the known rule of \\"the less familiar you are with everything the better\\" would work in spades here, 21 Jump Street still offers quite a few surprises and really funny antics. Their take on explosions for example is brilliant. By now you probably know Johnny Depp has a cameo in the movie since he had a recurring role in the original series. The crazy part is that this is the most enjoyable live-action Johnny Depp role in years. I'd even venture to say it's his best since his performance as Sir James Matthew Barrie in Finding Neverland since it's short, sweet, vulgar, and straight to the humorous point.<br /><br />21 Jump Street is one of the funniest R-rated films of the past few years and quite possibly the funniest since the original Hangover. This movie might end up with more people liking Channing Tatum or at least being able to tolerate him a bit more. Nobody could have guessed he'd tap into some comedic brilliance here. 21 Jump Street is a big-time comedy hit packed with loads of laughs to make it feel like the summer blockbuster season is already upon us.gether and it works in ways you can't even begin to imagine.

B004BJMEO6|4.0|This movie was very romantic and sexy. Both stars were electric towards each other and genuine. It really and truely help me to believe in love at first site. It took my breath away.
B007JRU2UK|4.0|Drama. Beginning to think I have become so used to TV action, dialogue, that I have trouble taking the pace of a true drama. Liked this film. This drama. Predictable for sure but liked it anyway. Liked Clooney but Academy Award performance? Not in my mind. Certainly not a comedy or funny. Not despressing but could drag some souls down. Neither a recommend or no recommend.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|The microphone recorded a substantial hiss. Yes, I have the AGC turned off! When I turn the volume down to deminuate the hiss, the audio was too low to be useable.<br /><br />Though not the best, I went back to the cheap RadioShack lav mikes.
B006WPSQVC|5.0|My husband and I just watched this movie for date night. This movie had action, adventure, tragedy, and a happy ending. I most enjoyed that there was a positive Christian message. I walk away from this movie wanting to become a better wife and mother.
B001EO2UJK|3.0|For the price it is expensive, but for the Genesis purist. it is a must have. Like a lot of people I am sad that there will not be any more Genesis albums, with Phil collins having gone deaf, it does not hold out much hope for a reunion, so we have to put up with re-releases. The set itself with re-mastered CDs/DVDs of the best of the early Genesis prior to Gabriel leaving is fairly ordinary. The accompanying booklet is a let down. Buy the individual CDs & DVDs, a cheaper option and you are not missing much. I would hazard a guess and say that in the near future a Pink Floyd style boxset would be forthcoming, so save your pounds/dollars for that day.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is an awesome app. its easy to use, and has all the versions that I like to study from

YOU NEED TO CHANGE OR PEOPLE WILL NOT FILL OUT THE REVIEWS, THUS HURTING THE SELLER OF ANOTHER GOOD REVIEW
B006ZEDZNY|1.0|I love Johnny Depp. But this is one of the  worst movies I have ever seen.  It is slow. It drags and drags and drags on. The story line if there is one is hard to follow. I couldn't even make it to the end.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Not a horror novel, but a great time-travel story of love and nostalgia...for a time long past when sodas cost 1 cent and the world was still a trusting place. For a place one can call home, for \\"home is watching the moon rise over the open, sleeping land and having someone you can call to the window, so you can look together. Home is where you dance with others, and dancing is life.\\"
B006VRZ5YM|4.0|Funny movie. Easy to get into. Sorry guys but it is a chick flick. But at least it isn't sappy.
B004DK5CW4|1.0|This paean to selfishness and narcissism is a new low for a company that presents itself as a purveyor of family entertainment. The central character, Penny Tweedy, is a self-absorbed \\"sportswoman\\" (read \\"spoiled rich girl\\") who forsakes everything, including her children, in a desperate grab at notoriety after inheriting the greatest racehorse in history. Tweedy may not be the monster that Disney paints her to be in this picture, but the fact that Disney would come up with such an ugly script is stomach-turning.<br />This movie follows much the same formula as the Disney film \\"Miracle\\" about the 1980 US Olympic hockey team, but here the drama is fabricated, unlike the reality behind Team USA's incredible victory which had real suspense. And there's really very little to like about the world of horse-racing, which is a grimy business, not a sport. Disney did do a good job of depicting that side of the racing world, but fell flat on its face when it tried to elicit some sympathy for the Tweedy character with absurd scenes like the ones where she sheds a tear while she waits for race results half a continent away from where the golden moments of her children's lives are passing without her presence. This is the ultimate yuppie movie with a central character who cares more about her own self-gratification than she does about anything else, including her family. Ugly, ugly, ugly!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|After reading the Hunger Games trilogy not long ago, I admit that I was quite reluctant to read another dystopian novel because my standards were raised considerably high from Suzanne Collins. I picked up this book from seeing a friend reading it, and after a few chapters I was hooked!<br /><br />There were tons of twists and turns that kept me wanting to read more and more. It continued to get better and better, and by the end I could not believe that I had read the entire novel in a two-day weekend...<br /><br />The only thing that I wasn't so fond of was the many \\"fictional terms/things\\" that are thrown at you straight from the beginning, but besides that I have nothing but positive thoughts to convey!<br /><br />Enjoy!
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Author Gary Taubes examines the evidence piece by piece, and the science points to one stark conclusion: Only about a third of adults can eat a proportionally high-carb diet and ever hope to be thin. For the rest of us, our bodies simply don't work that way.<br /><br />The science behind fat metabolism is well-established, and as a science PhD myself, I can't see any fundamental errors in the author's conclusions. My hope is that in part because of Taubes' work, we'll be able to begin developing an honest, effective public health policy: one where we begin with the idea that fruits and grains are healthy for us, but only as long as we don't eat so much of them that we tip our bodies past equilibrium. If we reach the point where our fat metabolism isn't able burn off the carbohydrates we store as fat during the day, then we will just continue to gain weight eating these \\"healthy\\" carbohydrates to excess.<br /><br />As Taubes advises: We're not getting fat because we're eating too much; we're eating too much because we're getting fat. Each of us has a different level of carbohydrates that we can eat before our bodies can't help but get fat. I read \\"Why We Get Fat\\" during my research toward writing a book of my own. Finally understanding that we each have our own specific level of carbohydrates that we can take in -- before our body can't help but gain weight -- has been a huge insight for me.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book highly enough for anyone who wants to understand why the common-sense \\"calories in = calories out\\" idea really is neither defensible nor useful in helping us manage our weight.
B004J1DBJI|2.0|Overall a wonderful app and a wonderful service. HOWEVER on my Galaxy Nexus, the text is so small as to literally be unreadable. This is not just my eyes, I have asked people from 10 to 60. If there is a font control I'm missing, then I apologize for the two stars, but I really haven't been able to find one. It is nearly unusable on this phone as is.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Like this game...kept me occupied during three hour wait @ dmv to renew my drivers license...not a gaming fan, but this brings back good memories of playing solitaire as a kid.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Whilst a Study in Scarlet began the canon - the Adventures marked the beginning of the saga that became the most celebrated fictional character ever and deservedly so.  Full of intriguing mysteries - not all murders and some quite prosaic but true mysteries.  a pity we seem to lack mystery writers now - they rely on serial killers and not the mystery!
0817439390|5.0|I got this book in late January 2012, about a week before getting my first DSLR. My goodness, I had no idea what I was missing when using the \\"Auto\\" setting on digital cameras. Before reading Understanding Exposure, my camera flash would pop up all the time to compensate for low light, etc. I now am in full control of the pictures I want to take, and never again have to use Auto or those other special functions like Portrait, Landscape, Action, etc. The book is written for someone who has never used the manual settings on a camera before. He provides some exercises and there are web videos you can check out as well. I am taking amazing pictures with my DSLR, and I also take much better pictures with my point and shoot and even my cell phone.<br /><br />I have a new hobby, and Bryan Peterson's Understanding Exposure is the book that started it all, LOL. You cannot go wrong with this book!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|this Bible app is a must have.  the only issue is that it needs to be able to be read offline.  it cannot that i have found yet.  other than that it is pure excellence.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|Funny movie! Enjoyed watching.<br />My husband and I had an enjoyable evening<br />viewing the movie together.<br /><br />We would recommend it to others!
B0013FFMOK|5.0|I read the book after watching the movie several times. They are quite different in a lot of parts so if you're expecting a total remake of the book you'll probably be disappointed. I haven't seen any other similar movies so I can't compare them to this one. I don't take movies too seriously like a lot of people do so I thought this was an entertaining ride. I wouldn't recommend it for very young kids due to the fact there's a few nerve racking parts and some parts they may find slow but older kids (maybe 9) and on up it will be fine if they're into this type of movie.
B007FDE4Y8|4.0|Recieved my Opteka Steadyvid Pro promptly. Item was well packaged and appears to be solidly built.  Like any \\"steadycam\\" it is a bit tricky to balance -- I am still getting it just right -- but appears it will work well -- especially at this price point.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins is the award winning author of Hunger Games. The book was partially inspired by  the Greek myth Theseus and the Minotaur. The film, Hunger Games, will be released March 23, 2012. More than a thousand showtimes are already sold out, the movie's advance ticket sales already surpass those of the first \\"Twilight\\" movie at the same point in that film's sale cycle.<br /><br />\\"As long as you can find yourself, you'll never starve.\\" This is what Katniss's father tells her because she is named after a water plant with roots that taste like potatoes. Even before she is entered as a tribune in the games she finds herself, finds her strength and teaches herself how to hunt so she and her family won't starve. When her younger sister is chosen for the games, Katniss finds herself, her strength and takes her sister's place. In the games she gets far by finding herself, her strength, making the choices she wants to make. But she also ends up doing something that is not like her, having to feign love that she doesn't feel, and if she doesn't pull it off she and her family could be in danger. Will she have to choose between a boy she really cares about for one she doesn't truly love? Will she break the heart of someone she cares about, someone who cares about her? Is the price she may have to pay to be a champion too much?<br /><br />The book is great. I loved it. People are crazy about it. Young adult books with strong female heroines are fantastic for tweens, teens, young adults and everyone to read. The author, Suzanne Collins, makes good use of the five senses, gives the reader a good feel of place and time, good world building. The author's characters are strong, compelling, and very real. It's an exciting, fast action story with twists. A page turner. I highly recommend it. No matter how good the movie is, there is no way it will be better or as good as the book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This does exactly what it should. It gives you lots of options in deciding how you will play your game and it gives you your choice of the type of game you want to play. Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1
B0063IH60K|4.0|it plays well and can be challenging. I definitely recommend this one if you like this type of card game.
B0039N74CW|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies. If you've never seen it, then it's a must. Funny, heart warming, good story line. Quality acting and well made movie.
B004SRWW0C|5.0|Best one out there, clean and simple interface that can be used on phone and tablet alike. It also has a range of functionality that is nice if you are a developer or intend to be like moi --CpSc Major.
B0062NAX1U|4.0|Story line is awesome, the movie is well produced. The acting isn't \\"A List\\" but IS much improved over the previous movies. Great family movie (more appropriate for older children).
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I was not expecting much from a free app, but was pleasantly surprised. the interface is great, the versions are extensive for any taste. my favorite feature is the audio feature. being a college student, I already read hundreds of pages every week,so being able to rest and in a way read is awesome.<br /><br />I highly recommend this app
B005PV81MS|4.0|If you like comedy, action, and sci-fi you need to see this movie. Haven't seen aliens so cool since Alien.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the fact you have earn points to unlock the games. Its a great app for kids and adults. Its endless fun working hard to earn the next game. Thumbs Up!
0439023483|5.0|A very good - no, excellent book... that was almost impossible to put down. I started this book with low-expectations, and ended up enjoying this waayy more than I ever imagined! It had me on the edge of my seat almost every step of the way - anxious to find out what's to come next, who would survive, and how they would accomplish the tremendous feats set before them. Very involving! It is most definitely a story of a battle, but a powerful one & thought provoking one! Yes, there is killing & starvation... pain & extreme suffering - and at the hands of children. But it's also a story of survival & strength. It's real & raw... even intense at times... but well worth it all!<br /><br />Now to get my hands on book two... while I wait for the movie premiere, next week - and hope that doesn't pale in comparison to the captivating excellence of the book!! :)<br /><br />** Note: While I enjoyed this book, immensely.. I would not recommend it for kids under 15, unless they're extremely mature(emotionally) & well grounded - and the parent(s) of the child is/are willing to necessitate lots of discussion along the way!!
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Nice alternative to spending a lot of money on a gps if you already have a laptop & Microsoft streets.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|This is a very good biography of Steven Jobs.  It is very good reading.  It portrays his good and bad traits in a very good reading format of one of the most creative people in the last 100 years. I recommend it highly.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|200 pound runner (trail runs and half-marathons) and road cyclist (spirited recreational/fitness) who has used several wired and wireless cyclometers as well as stepping up from the Garmin 101 (for running). Yep, that's old tech Garmin, but some of you might identify.<br /><br />When I used to use the 101, it was amazing. Yeah, it's an awkward form factor and takes about 3 full minutes to find the satellites, but a guy's gotta stretch anyway, right? Once it locks on, it is a great way to measure distance...as long as you aren't running under the elevated Metro lines in Brooklyn or in deep forest cover.<br /><br />Fast forward to five months ago. Bought the 405cx off Amazon at a great price for running. First day I used it (and there are about 30 great youtube instructional videos available) I discovered that even under heavy cloud cover, the 405 locks onto the satellites in approximately 5-10 seconds. Running on singletrack in dense woods, there is NO loss of satellite contact. Fast forward to 2 months ago when I bought my first road bike in 4 years, a 4.7 Madone. The 405 discovered the DuoTrap sensor almost immediately--on my rides I now have two screens automatically swapping every 20 seconds between HR stats and cycling stats. Mileage is dead-on. Cadence/elevation is very accurate.<br /><br />One \\"fix\\" I'd recommend for like items going forward: I can change between running and cycling modes, but it's not possible (AFAIK) to swap in the middle of a duathlon/biathlon. I keep it in biking mode and just change the running sections when I upload them wirelessly onto my laptop.<br /><br />Another plus: newer digital wireless cyclometers have no issue with this, but my analog wireless computer would not register when using my bike light on anything below High--some kind of interference with the signal. I got an old Polar handlebar mount from a friend and run this watch on my bars as my only computer now and lose no signal when running my Niterider MiNewt 600 on any power.<br /><br />One minus: (again, AFAIK) there is no \\"light on\\" mode. When the sun goes down, you can touch the bezel with two fingers for brief illumination but I haven't found a way to keep it on. Then again, at night under the MiNewt (which is better than my Wrangler's headlights), I'm just euphoric that I'm able to extend my cycling to a 24 hour possibility.<br /><br />In summary, I haven't found any reason not to buy this piece, just opportunities for improvement.
0062082353|5.0|This is one of the best reads I've had in a long time.  I usually do my reading at night in bed.  This book is so fascinating it has kept me up most of the night.  I suggest anyone considering military service read this book.  Thank you Chief Petty Officer Kyle, for your dedication in serving our country with every ounce of strength and common sense a person should have in the military of the USA.  I hope G-d blesses you and yours with well-being, good health, plenty of happiness, prosperity, long life and thanks for putting out this outstanding book.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Well I am one of those guys who insists on running with his AM/FM headset. I have gone through many headphones in the process. These headphones without a doubt have held up longer than any other that I have purchased including many way overpriced \\"sports\\" headphones that were supposed to be water resistant and all that.  For the price these are great. I use them exclusively outdoors for workouts.
0670022950|4.0|Like Steven Pinker's other books this one is a challenge to get through, but it has been worth it.  His theme, that human violence has declined throughout history, and that even the bloody Twentieth Century was less bloody than the centuries which preceded it, is something that most of us will find deeply counterintuitive.  To make his point, he needs to use statistics, lots of them, which means that readers will need to wade through a lot of figures, supported by graphs, and detailed exposition of what it all means.  Since human nature is central to this, he later gets into quite a bit of psychology and neurological science.  Although he can be an entertaining writer when he tries, there is no way to make this easy going for the general reader.  Be prepared to go slowly and work at it a bit, there's a lot to absorb here.<br /><br />Whether or not he is ultimately correct about the decrease of violence, he quickly establishes a strong case for it.  If nothing else, reading this is an excellent corrective for romanticization of the past.  It's not hard to see that numerically low casualty figures in pre-state tribal warfare may actually be quite high in proportion to total population, but it can be hard to accept that a bloody modern war may actually have lower casualties, again in proportion to the population.  We know that treatment of women and children has been harsh throughout much of history, but it takes a book like this to point out just how harsh it has been.  Genocide, torture, random violence, slavery, unbelievable cruelty toward animals, unbelievable levels of disease, filth, and ignorance, it all makes our modern world seem better than we are accustomed to thinking.<br /><br />One counterintuitive point which I found myself questioning was the assertion that overall human intelligence has been rising, and in a relatively short period of time, quite a few points in the past century alone.  This brought to mind some of the Nineteenth Century tests that have made the rounds as evidence of the dumbing down of education, high school *entrance* exams that would be challenging for some of today's college seniors.  Shortly after that thought had crossed my mind, Pinker brought it up himself, and made clear what he meant, that where we had improved was in the application of analytical reasoning, while admittedly absorbing a narrower range of factual information in many areas.  I'm still not entirely convinced, but as always, he does not make any assertions without some solid reason for doing so.<br /><br />I can't say that I actually enjoyed this book, but then, it is not meant as entertainment.  I do feel that I've been challenged and informed, and yes at some points it actually was entertaining.e made the rounds as evidence of the dumbing down of education, high school *entrance* exams that would be challenging for some of today's college seniors.

B006OV7RQ4|4.0|I watched this movie, and it wasn't a bad movie; However, after watching the Short (which was included in the Extras)that was a precursor (15-20 minutes long) to this movie, I believe the movie would have been much, much better, if this information/video had been included in the actual movie, although a much longer movie, it would have been well worth it for the viewer. Definitely a well made movie.

B0059XTUB8|5.0|What a rare and beautiful, but small glimpse into a huge, but rarely understood actress. If I even thought I knew anything about Marilyn Monroe, I didn't know anything. All Actors and Actresses were unbelievable....the sets...perfection. But where was Michelle Williams ???.....All I Saw Was Marilyn Monroe.....I'm sure I have seen Michelle Williams in something before.....Did I???....But what???....I hope it's not, but I think this is a once in a lifetime performance, and she, as well as the others in the making of this film, should be proud to know they have done work that deserves all the praise and awards it gets.....and then some. That's right kid....you nailed it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|heard about book thru co-worker and became obsessed with the whole series. Never read anything so addicting. Didn't realize till the end of Grey the story continues from Darker to Freed but so far each book keeps you on your toes.
B002U6EWZ6|5.0|i was very happy with the quality of the dvd and the quick shipment after ordering it. also the price was very affordable.
B006ISJQBM|2.0|The actors themselves aren't to blame as they do the best they can with what they're given. The duo of Depp and Rispoli does well to keep the viewer interested and Robisi as Moberg brings a good humor to the film. Ekhart's Sanderson is terrible however which is made even worse by the fact that Sanderson was one of the most interesting characters in the book. He works at the paper and in the first few chapters is beating protesters with a sign, is fired by Lotterman for threatening to twist off his head, is the main protagonist in the brawl with the restaurant patrons that lands Kemp and Sala in jail in the film, and is one of the participant's in the beating of Lotterman at the end of the novel in which Lotterman is killed.<br /><br />The film adaption is watered down with key elements that made the book so amazing completely missing. Characters are subbed out for other characters and plot lines get twisted for no reason other than to make the film seemingly incredibly dull. The ending is terrible compared to the brawl, killing of Lotterman and scramble to get out of Puerto Rico by the main characters at the end of the book leaving anyone who's read it scratching their head wondering why the film makers chose to fix something that wasn't broke. The ending credits claim Kemp went back to New York, married Chenault, and became a famous writer, hinting towards the fact that Kemp is Thompson, however Chenault is not mentioned at all after her exit in the book. Read the book, and if your bored watch the film. I gave it two stars because the Depp/Rispoli duo enabled me to sit through the whole film.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Has to be one of the best books that I have ever read. Love the two main characters and the love/passion they have for each other. Could not put the book own till it was finished..very hot scenes.plus an amazing story..you will not be disappointed..

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was the first book that I have read on my new kindle and I couldnt put it down. The book has everything that you need in a good book.  It has romance, action, suspense, and a thrill.  I felt like I was actually Katniss.  I read the book the moment I woke up, at work, and even before I went to bed. This book will be my all time favorite. Even if you dont like reading you will love reading this book.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|The plotting, the pacing, the planning, the mystery...  It was absolutely fantastic.  It is _very_ rare (sadly) that I feel driven to write a review here, but this set of stories is just too damn good not to do it.  They leave you breathless.  What I think it reminds me of the most is the Game of Ice and Fire books by George R. R. Martin (Game of Thrones, etc) in that both you see things from different sides, seeing one side walk into the traps laid by the other side, and that you keep telling yourself \\"it can't get any worse for them...  HOLY CRAP IT JUST GOT *SO* MUCH WORSE!!!\\"<br /><br />Great fun.  Absolutely great read.  _SO_ going to read any more I can find!
B004UXUX4Q|1.0|Where is the \\"hilarity?\\" Where is the \\" funny ?\\" This is the worst movie I have ever seen! - and it was nominated for 5 Academy Awards!  The critics must have been drunk or they never saw the movie.  It reverses comedy and tragedy.  A really horrible, depressing movie about a dysfunctional family.

B000W1V7K4|5.0|IT'S ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN.  IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY THAT I PAID FOR IT.  THANK YOU
B007CGLRWA|4.0|Rented this from Amazon Instant video the day of limited theatre release, 16 March 2012; well worth the price because it's not a film you really need to see on the big screen and have to pay the movie-house prices for.<br /><br />A tough film worth watching.
B007H7XJD4|4.0|I found this to play out much like the traditional Greek mythology. If you enjoy transliterated stories you will probably enjoy this movie. Otherwise, it will be boring and plot-less.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My whole family enjoys this game, even the 4 year old. I hate the smiling pigs, they'll raise your blood pressure...you'll see! Enjoy!
