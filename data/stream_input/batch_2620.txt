1573226521|5.0|I've loved this book for several years now. It was one of the first books that inspired me to become a writer and I couldn't put it down until I was finished. I suggest you skip the movie and read this novel instead. There are many scenes they left out and characters that were completely cut. Alex Garland is an excellent and inspiring writer.<br /><br />-Kris Noel<br />Author of Lionhead and The Serenity Compound.<br />[[ASIN:098269718X Lionhead (Volume 1)]]<br />[[ASIN:1625530064 The Serenity Compound]]
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like to play this game.  It had some challenges but I didn't feel like quitting or cheating.  I am fairly new to gaming on my kindle so this is great.<br />MCPR
0307887448|5.0|I read this novel last year and completely fell in love with it. It's strictly a fun read that keeps you interested the whole time. It's perfect for the summer!<br /><br />-Kris Noel<br />[[ASIN:098269718X Lionhead (Volume 1)]]<br />[[ASIN:1625530064 The Serenity Compound]]
B0042RJWTM|5.0|this is one of my very favorite westerns ever. this is my favorite lee marvin role. the actor could relate to the character and it shows. jack palance is great in a supporting role.
0812550706|5.0|I was always wary about reading science fiction, just because I found them intimidating and hard to follow, but Ender's Game changed my perspective. It was one of the first science fiction novels to drag me in and never let go. Ender's Game is one of my favorite novels and I follow the entire Ender series. I hope the movie will live up to the novel, but this book will always have a place in my heart.<br /><br />-Kris Noel<br />[[ASIN:098269718X Lionhead (Volume 1)]]<br />[[ASIN:1625530064 The Serenity Compound]]
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|QR returns to the sound we all originally followed them for. This is a reemergence of Queensryche, the band sounds amazing and rejuvenated.
0525478817|4.0|This is the first John Green book I've read and I liked it a lot. I DO think that the dialogue was a bit ridiculous at times, but Hazel was an excellent protagonist and I couldn't help falling in love with Augustus. It also did make me cry like a baby. A book that makes you feel on this level is incredible, so I think it's a must read.<br /><br />-Kris Noel<br />[[ASIN:098269718X Lionhead (Volume 1)]]<br />[[ASIN:1625530064 The Serenity Compound]]
B0031RAOVY|5.0|A wonderful story about the love and devotion between human and his dog.<br />A tearful tale but it warms the heart.
0553386794|5.0|I started reading these books after being intrigued by the first season of the show (I think a lot of people were), but I'm glad I decided to do so. These books are incredible and you can't put them down. Watching the show and reading them has helped me completely understand what's going on. You won't regret getting into this series.<br /><br />-Kris Noel<br />[[ASIN:098269718X Lionhead (Volume 1)]]<br />[[ASIN:1625530064 The Serenity Compound]]
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the best bingo game I have ever played. Lots of different rooms to play in. Slots are also available with this. Very wonderful!!!!
1423136802|5.0|Bought 2 sets for gifts.  The kids loved it and couldn't stop talking about it.  I recommend it as a gift.
0375826742|5.0|Just a very enjoyable book, well written and an easy read. And of course I'm trying to read the whole series.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|Bought the movie along with the pbk5-book boxed set.  Great gift.  The kids loved it and watched the movie immediately.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|this was the meanest and possibly best bond movie ever. i hated the one part with the kimono dragon, but overall i loved it.
B008469DGY|3.0|Fun game but it FAILS go give you the seconds you EARN.  That is disappointing....especially when you are on a hole-in-one roll.  You feel cheated.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A really fun yet challenging game. I enjoyed playing it. My favourite level is number 9. There were a lot of steps.
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|I couldn't understand the game, the instructions weren't as clear every time I moved a piece I could move the ones next to in the same direction one space only than I could only go backwards. I played for about 30 minutes before I gave up uninstalled and played another game I knew how to play :(
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I Love this game & I'm constantly trying to beat my friends. Subway surfers is ten times better then temple run.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I love these types of games. The storyline was good. I liked that it could make you jump out of your skin. Can't wait for #2!
B005LAIHE0|1.0|This movie went on for over two hours, needlessly.  I thought it was boring, way too long and dumb.  I will be telling everyone I know not to watch this movie,  it was a huge waste of my time!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Very disappointed in the writing, felt like the story was going nowhere and nothing from previous two books was resolved in this book.  Also thought this would be a trilogy and that this was the last bookof the series....not impressed at all.
B005KELW26|5.0|I LOVE IT SAYS IT ALL :]  IT IS VERSITAL, FINALLY I FOUND OUT IT WAS A 7 FIRE AND GOT THE RIGHT SIZE FOLIO
0470876417|5.0|great information and paradigm  good illustrations and text information .. make a white board for use.<br />Used in most Masters level programs.
B003O86FMW|5.0|How can anyone say that this book is any less than the first?! Can't wait to start the third book!
B005V2S7FW|2.0|I already have Last Pass installed on my desktop and laptop computers, so I thought it would be a benefit on my Kindle Fire. After downloading the \\"FREE\\" app...I noticed that the Free portion was for only 14 days, after which I would be charged $1 a month. Guess what ?  This app will remain in the Cloud and will be banned from my Kindle until it is truly FREE.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|While setup and access was easy, there is a problem with going backwards to previous pages with full site. I changed to the official app with better results.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|While this was my least favorite of the three books I Loved It! I like others thought this would be the end but I'm not disappointed to know more is coming. I'm happy with the development of Eva and Gideon's relationship but I'm ready for the rock star conflict to be over there seems to be so many other obstacles for them to face and overcome. While I do feel the book was kind of drawn out, as stated before I still loved it and I'm still a fan and can't wait for the next installment.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love the way Mr. Hosseini writes. His words captivate and I hesitate to say anything that might make a reader not want to read this book. It is worth every moment. I have to say at times I got confused. I wanted more at the end. It felt unemotional to me. I don't want to ruin the story so I can't really say more. But...this book was worth waiting for!
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|Voyager downloading has been impossible to sync from Google site and does not work for me.<br />So cannot use the product.. very disappointed.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great little book that brought back memories of my dog and the years we spent together. Highly recommended read from the dog's point of view.
B005S9EKCW|2.0|The regular DVD and Digital copied were not included in this purchase. This Item was not as described. The Blu-ray played well.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I enjoy the game good for when bored and looking for something to do. Easy to pick up on how to do well.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I never write reviews but this book moved me to tell the \\"TRUTH\\".  This book is applicable to any and all and should be considered mandatory reading for high school students.  Amazing.
B008M721MS|1.0|I have not gotten this to work yet on a brand new Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\".  The app either claims that it cannot connect due to \\"network setting\\" problems, or it crashes back out to the home screen while trying to load my contact list.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Bought it because my grandson likes it a lot.  I also enjoyed it and play it in the car, especially when he is with me. He is 19.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|needs full gyro control. but ok for free game would be nice if you could get diamonds easier and if the guns were cooler
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I downloaded this book some time back based on an article I had read. I don't remember the context of the article as it was some time ago.  But, this book was an excellent read. It was therapeutic in many ways and really gave me some perspective on life and especially how good life is for me now.  Not in the plan, but definitely a benefit, was the education on logo therapy.
B005544TRQ|5.0|If you are willing to relax, roll with the stories that could be true, and accept the characters as they are you will enjoy this show.  Fate brought the two main characters together and the challenges their secret carries adds a dimension to their unlikely relationship.  If you ever wanted to see a mentor/student relationship dream situation, well here it is.  Every character represents the various qualities that you see in your everyday surroundings.  We gather as a family with are two teenage children and make each episode a family time fun experience.
B006LSZECO|3.0|A lot of plot twists, disappointed on how some panned out. Characters are likeable and easy to despise at the same time.
B00002N9ER|5.0|I use these things not for holding a flashlight, but to hold the license plate on the front of my truck.  I have a winch that has a roller fairlead, so a pair of these is mounted to my license plate, and they snap securely onto the vertical pair of rollers.  Easily removable, but it takes a good pull on each one to get it loose from the winch.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is the first review I've ever written for a book, but I just have to say how much I LOVE \\"Tangled!!!\\"  This book had it all for me - it was HILARIOUS, sweet, cute, romantic, and steamy!!!  I found myself laughing out loud many times while reading it!!!  Drew is SOMETHING ELSE - I completely fell in love with him!!!  And Kate - I absolutely love her, too - she is definitely Drew's match!!!  I won't give anything away - if you want to thoroughly enjoy a story from start to finish, I highly recommend this book!!!  I can't wait to read more from Emma Chase!!!  :-)
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|The cast in this film is amazing. The combination of terrific actors and legendary musicians/singers was incredible. It is humorous and sad at the same time dealing with a subject that is usually not very popular. However, it does have some very positive moments.
B001NTWFXW|5.0|I'm a fledgling Bossa Nova fan. I bought this as my very first album after studying the reviews here on Amazon. Now that I've listened to it enough times I understand why it is such a seminal work--it seems to underpin so much of the music that came after it. Thanks to all the knowledgeable Bossa Nova reviewers out there, you didn't steer me wrong!
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book was awesome and I love the crisis in this book because it makes the story so much more interesting
B0063M22QO|4.0|Moving tiles is easy and graphics are colorful.<br />In a word, fun. The audio is good as well. The limited background and tile design could be improved.
193700788X|4.0|I wasn't ready for the series to end. I kind of felt this story was rushed. Maybe the book could have been longer or have two books to close up the series.
B009LDCXQQ|4.0|As a Supernatural viewer, I noticed how the show started to lose it's way the past few seasons. Season 8 really put Supernatural back on its track. This season had a great plot, with some very entertaining classic monster of the week stories. I found some of the new characters very interesting(i.e. Kevin and so on.) There were some episodes that did not keep my attention, but that was only like 2 out of 23 episodes. The show runner did a great job this year, and the writers came up with some cool ideas. I can't wait to add this season to my blu-ray collection, and season 9 should turn out to be great! Overall, This season made me a happy fan-boy haha.
B000Y90VO2|4.0|Excellent movie. You started to laugh from the beginning through the end of the movie. I recomended to everyone. Funny movie.
B00C1LIYWM|2.0|I was disappointed  For somebody who didn't read a book it is going to be another love story with a little thriller in it, for me it was a BAD adaptation of very excellent book. The book was so much more intense. She was actually planning to escape for almost a year. Stealing money form his wallet, planning everything step by step. It was slow and nerve wracking process that made a reader chew his/her nails.
159448385X|5.0|I could not put this book down! Interesting to read and &#34;live&#34; it through women's perspective. A &#34;must read&#34; for anyone.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great. This app is addictive. It drives me crazy sometimes but I love it. I can't get enough of it.
B0064MGU98|5.0|enjoyed this greatly. very entertaining well acted television series. Acting well done. Storyline excellent. Engrossing, entertaining, high quality entertainment about a law practice in Chicago.

B008NCSZQ8|1.0|i can't really tell if this movie is good or not.  against my better judgement i decided to stream the HD version through amazon.  now, bearing in mind that i have a 45 megabit internet connection, more than capable of streaming a movie, amazon's servers are so OVERLOADED and SLOW that they had to keep lowering the quality, and lowering the quality, until finally, half way through the movie stopped streaming altogether and wouldn't restart at all.<br /><br />I'll never stream another movie through amazon!  what's the point of paying top dollar for the HD version when at best you get to watch in resolution lower than an old 1970s television?  and in my case, i didn't get to watch the movie at all!<br /><br />also, you can't stream movies on your computer, like televisions shows offered through amazon.  you have to do it through some klugy interface on a blueray player (don't get me started about that pathetic technology!)<br /><br />i'm sorely disappointed.  Amazon does most things very well, but this is not one of them.  I want my money back!<br /><br />:(
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|One of the best series I have ever watched, can't wait until season 4.  However, I am ready for them to kill someone I don't like!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love this game  take  your time and remember to plan ahead every move  keep pen and paper on hand. Beware you may find it hard to stop playing
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|I'm so glad she decided to sing more. Her piano work is fantastic and her singing adds an intimacy hard to duplicate. I extremely pleased with this release.
B00B5ARKDE|4.0|My kids enjoyed this movie and have watched it several times in the few weeks we have had it.  I've watched it with them too and it is entertaining.  I would recommend to anyone with kids who love the Lego Batman video games.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game so much. I will and have recommended this game to plenty of people I know. It is addicting.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I had all of the albums by the original line up and am glad they put another one together. I will never grow tired of this great rock group who really don't always get their due. Buy this!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|absolutely love it.. the only thing is it is a little easy to beat the game.. but other than that I loveeeeeeeee it!!!! SO FUN
B00BWJARHO|2.0|Why would they make the shortest book into 3, 3 hour movies? Its just a gimmick to try to make as much money as possible. All they do is dreadfully lengthen this movie which couldve been 45 minutes. They do this because they know that people will watch it no matter what and buy all 3 movies. I loved the lord of the rings, but unfortunately I got sucked in to watching this too. It makes me sad to think about how many talented screen writers could have come up with something so much better. Also, they added characters and events that did not happen in the book. What does that tell you?
B0064MPXFA|5.0|An extremely well written show.  Had started watching on broadcast TV the last season.  Was glad to find it available to view from Amazon.  Caught up with Season one. Currently getting through season two.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|All actors on their best game...not a love story...it is a life story, the inner circles of relationships that no one else understands unless u r in the circle....
B007RQ6WCA|1.0|See above for similar poor connection when clicking on the app. I have been uploading individual docs from inside the Dropbox via Cloud Drive, which works fine, but is cumbersome not to be able to downlload the whole Dropbox and add to it later automatically
B00BEXB18M|5.0|Seems like every other album Dave puts out a mainstream album and a true Megadeth album... Each with their own benefits. This is a solid album; plays well all the way through didn't want to skip any tracks. It won't get you thrashing around and moshing in the living room, but it is a great headphone and driving album. I personally like these albums.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I hadn't planned on reading this book. I'd heard about it for the longest time but it didn't sound like something I'd enjoy. I finally broke down and bought it and have to say &#34;wow&#34;. The first time I picked it up, I read more than half the book in one sitting. I have to say this is one of the more engaging books I've read--ever! Unique style, riveting, honestly a great read. The movie doesn't give it justice! Now, gladly, on to book 2...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Really enjoyed this series. Left with a cliff-hangar. Can't believe I must wait a year to see more!<br /><br />Good job
B008UTV6S8|5.0|We enjoy this album even more than we thought we would.  The new songs are great, the reworking of old favorites gives them new life, and Paul Simon is still a master musician.  This is well worth adding to your collection.
0785125965|5.0|my boyfriend loves it, good quality, clear description, timely shipping, couldn't ask for more....would buy again! I hope we can turn it around and keep it in good shape for his collection!
B0026QC0TA|5.0|Both my wife and I thought the acting was good and the plot easily followed. It was quite moving when the main actor, Damon, gave up a potentially lucrative law practice to serve the greater good, if I got the drift correctly
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This second season of the big bang theory was received in excellent condition.  This series is still funny no matter where you start viewing it.  Not recommended for children.
B000UZNSWM|5.0|An outstanding presentation of the &#34;Forgotten War&#34;.  The author has done a remarkable job of researching not only the Korean war but the history and actions of all the principal personages of the time.  Finally someone had the guts to spell out the REAL Douglas Mac Arthur and expose the many GIs that died to satisfy his vanity.  As a GI who spent 15 months of my life in the &#34;forgotten War&#34;  I found &#34;The Coldest Winter &#34; one of the best books of my time.  Only a person who lived through those trying years can really appreciate this book.  You can bet I will recommend it as MUST READ.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|For those of you that aren't familiar with the play, it is a little bit of a deviation from standard interpretations of the play but it is an excellent film altogether. All of the actors were perfect and amazing as well! :)
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|This app had me kept my weight in check and when using it over time I have seen some weight loss! :) It is fairly easy to do all the fitness excercises because most don't even use any materials to work out. It also allows an exercise time limit ranging from just 5-30 minutes. The full workout gives such a sweat! But, the BEST workout in this part of the workout is the abs because you can actually feel your abs working out. The part I LOVE most about this app is is that you can chose the full workout or a workout that works out one part of your body.
B00ALKRVTM|5.0|This is a good compilation of Poirot's short stories. Definately worth if you are a big fan of Poirot, even if you already own some of these.
B00COMLLX2|1.0|It seems a misnomer: pinball, in that Zen is the main item that is available and then not a successful connection when trying to use this app. I don't see how one can use the tablet for pinball play anyway, unless the keyboard comes into play with flippers via certain designated keys
193700788X|1.0|Really? That is all I can say!! Fine Eric doesn't end up with Sookie! But to let him end up this way? WTH? What was CH thinking? this book doesn't give us readers the closure we deserve! I'm glad I only got this from the library or I would be royally peed off!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good puzzle game. Love the escape games. Hoping for more..Had fun playing with my husband.<br />A fun challenge for a change
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|good I like it but it could also be better the types of guns and the sound need s some work though
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|Too many tech probes to count. Do not waste your time on this one! Best part was deleting it from my kindle.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|If you want a realistic drama look else ware. If you want to see one of the coolest car chases and more car wrecks in 5 minutes then you will enjoy. This time John and his son have to kill an entire Russian gang of thugs. Yes they find trunk load of guns and John drives a truck out of the back of a helicopter, but what do you expect, a political cat and mouse thriller?
B0096BIENY|5.0|Greatest Group around.  I loved this CD because it has all my favorite songs on it.  In fact this is my third one I have purchased.  I played the first one so much I wore it out and the second one was a gift.  Their voices are very soothing for the soul.  It is a must to have.
B00BJ9VBLI|2.0|thought i would get mroe levels that what i did for free. finished it in no time. not the best
B00CWY76CC|5.0|work your mind and still have fun. its like a what if scenario. not like it really would happen but what if it did
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I like the puzzles.  some are more challenging some a little too predictable.  Two things that are annoying the flip out of me:  1) the fact that you have to keep turning the stupid music off over and over ; and 2) that if you dont finish a level, you have to start over when you shut down.  I wouldnt pay for this.
B004FHP9KA|5.0|Inception is so good on so many levels!  Not just dream levels, either. The acting, the characters (especially Eames and Arthur), the visual effects, the storyline, the soundtrack - all are sooo good.  But, for me, what really cements at the &#34;top of the top&#34; movies are the twin themes woven into the movie: reconciliation and redemption. Reconciliation between son and father, reconciliation between wife and husband, and redemption through confession and confrontation.  You will need to watch it more than once to get a basic understanding of what's going on - and then, after that, watch it again  - and again - to allow the power of love and forgiveness go deep into your soul.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's really fun<br />It won't let me get free gems but it's a good game<br />I like the graphics but they could use a little help
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Absolutely wonderful movie. Real life lessons. I don't too much care for the actress and her acting skills, but the movie is great.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I really enjoy puzzles but they come with complications such as:  they require a lot of space to put together, a lot of space to store, and my cat likes to steal the pieces. This app is great. I allows me to do a large assortment of puzzles without any of these issues.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|Super Overdose<br /><br />The Man of Steel was the man of over-do. This movie was filled with SUPER Action, SUPER noise and SUPER Side effects.  It's obvious we all know how it ends, good verses evil and Superman saving the world, so with that said,  I will share my  thoughts on what those who haven't seen the movie may not know. We have a movie that is filled with loads of action, trips to space, galaxy's, mixed with earthy surroundings, and lots of flashbacks through out the movie.  The space ships to me, looked like the Cicad's bugs that have been hiding for the past 17 years and just recently  have been circulating amongst us. Who knows, maybe Michael Shannon who played the truly believable villain,\\"General Zod\\" brought them with him after he resurfaced to earth after 33 years of living in some type of cocoon. Shannon did a excellent job as portraying a villain. He was forceful, uncompassionate, tuff, strong and powerful. His facial expressions were even  convincing to  be the cold hearted character he played.  Lets face it, everyone likes a Super Hero, but Shannon was a Super Villain and I enjoyed his role and acting immensely.  Then we have Russell Crow who played the biological  father of superman. He made me Super happy when he didn't belt out a song \\"singing\\" a Super lullaby to baby Superman before sending the small wonder off into space to save the world.  The booms and the crashes through out the movie were bit much. The constant jumping  from one point to another, zig zagging  was as if there was a tennis match going on, and the dialogue did not always gel at times. Speaking of gel, Henry Cavill did a excellent job  in playing the part as Superman. While we watched him bounce off walls, crash into buildings, fly in the ski, I couldn't help but to notice how Super wonderful Superman's hair looked through out the movie, no doubt Super Gel, it never moved. The flashback during the movie showing superman childhood were my favorite parts of the movie, that'swhere you saw and felt  the true heart of the show.  All in All, if your  into  super action, your going to like it. What I felt it lacked was being able to reach the young viewers. I don't think young viewers would understand the \\"talk\\"  the dialogue is to mature for children to follow. A super hero should be able to touch the hearts of the young,  and the vulnerable, but in my opinion it didn't do that.  An overdose of unnecessary action.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|I in fact always keep this game in one of my pockets when going out to bars. It's easy enough to bring out the deck and play a quick game. The rules are simple enough to explain to newcomers and advanced enough to get people motivated for the challenge. Excellent game.
1423113497|5.0|My grandson loves these stories and will read them.  Getting him to read is a problem, so this means the books are great.
B00BDZV8R0|5.0|A very enjoyable double album. I bought the vinyl instead of the cd. For each song Fogerty tells a bit about why he wrote it and what the song is about. Also some of his thoughts on the 60's. Very well worth it.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|A deeply moving film with excellent performances from the actors, all of whom were perfectly cast. It also helped to bring the issue of mental illness out of the shadows with a frank and sympathetic portrayal of its characters. As Chris Matthews commented while praising the movie, it is about people who refuse to give up.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is interesting and unique. I enjoy that it's something of a scavenger hunt for clues that the player then has to figure out. I just wish it was a little more difficult.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I understand how some reviews critizes the singing part of the movie, in comparison to the musical stage performance.  But keep in mind, this is created as a movie, and not an on stage performance.  The actors are superb and movie great!
B00571F26Y|5.0|So glad I caught the repeat of Dr Oz with Dr Davis.  I stopped eating wheat about a month ago and I have lost 16 lbs.  After not being able to lose a pound for months.<br /><br />But the really Life-Changing part is that my very intense cravings have now gone away.  I thought that would never happen but it has now.  Even my late-at-night cravings have gone away.<br /><br />I have also cut way back on sugar and the other \\"white starches\\"<br />but I had tried that part in the past, it is only since I ALSO stopped Wheat (which I never tried before because I thought it was \\"healthy\\") that my constant Cravings have now gone away. I always thought it was only Sugar that gave me cravings but I now realize it was also Wheat.<br /><br />I suggest you give it a try just in case it works for you as well.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/12/14: I am now down 40 lbs and counting and my blood tests have all improved. I feel like I am \\"Free from Wheat\\" and all the cravings.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|cool. i thought that it would be like a another game that is dumb. i like how u can<br />compete in different competitions and feed them. everyone who gets this game i think u should rate it 5 stars!  the best part about it is that u get 3 gems if u rate it.<br />so do it!!!!!!!!!!!
B008Y73940|3.0|good movie it doesnt take long for figure out the plot but still enjoyable with popcorn or some pizza and family
1592407889|5.0|Shirley MacLaine is nuts...the real achievement of her lifetime is that in spite of her looniness, Sachi turned out to be a very normal person.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|we work on it together she gets a lot of joy from it horsey as she says it is her favorite she likes to help stir food and give treat
B003DT19F0|5.0|My 6 year old loves this movie and watches it all the time. It's nice to find movies that are appropriate for young children.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The most entertaining and challenging game I have seen in a while. Addictive, to say the least, no two are the same. LOVE IT!!!!
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|THIS IS THE OFFICIAL QUEENSRYCHE<br />I pre-ordered the deluxe edition, which has the bonus 3 live tracks.  James Barton returns to produce this album (mindcrime, empire, and promise land ring a bell). Todd La Torre was the right choice for this band, showing the power of the past and moving toward the future with a noticeably renewed vigor and power in this album. The band took its time and got the songs and the mix right on this album, as opposed to other version of this band that rushed an album out and then resend a new version out admitting the first mix was bad (and remix only makes it barely mediocre). This album is reminiscent of the mindcrime era, noting track one and track 7being interludes like on mindcrime. Yet, the material on this album is new, and has its own life, not just stealing the past. The only disappointment of this album is that I wish they had more than 11 new tracks for just over 35 minutes. The 3 live tracks on the deluxe edition (queen of the ryche, En Force, Prophecy) show why Latorre is the right choice and that the live show will be better than ever. The guitar work of Wilton and Lundgren bring back the melodic intertwined guitars of the past that made the band successful. And Rockenfield still bounds the skin while the bass of Jackson drives the sound home. One thing is for sure, this is the Ryche of the future. And one more thing, A big thanks for these guys being top class respectful to the fans, to the music, and the tradition of queensryche, moving forward with the music and not dwelling on the past, as opposed to another version that puts a big F.U. on its cover and then dwells on negativity and frankly insults the fans and tradition.<br /><br />7/2013 Update: charting at 23 its first week out at 13,500 sales (comparied to 82 and 5500 copies sold), I think the public has spoken on who is queensryche. lets see what happens in the courts this fall.<br /><br />3/2014 update: Listening more to this ablum, and now have had a chance tosee this version of of Queensryche live.  Wow.  This really is the band. It will be interesting to see how the courts rule, or possible out of court settlement ends this drama. But at this point this version has my vote. Great show, and great music in the tradition of Queensryche.
159463176X|4.0|I wasn't disappointed with this book, but the Kite-Runner was his best so far, I believe.  Some aspects were saddening, of course, but he tied the story line together at the end as I had hoped he would.  He does inject the faith and culture successfully, and his portrayal of the relationship between two men is done sensitively and lovingly.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Great movie, really enjoyed watching this funny chick flick with my girl, the characters were relatable and a great story....there truly is someone for everyone...
B000J10ERO|5.0|I hold up the 1978 SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE, with Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder, as the high watermark of all filmed  adaptions of beloved comic book characters. Everything about the movie worked, and so when I went to see SUPERMAN RETURNS, it was up against my memories of that previous classic. I hated the movie - I even fell asleep during it in the theater. Forward to the following year, and I bought the Ultimate Superman Collection, which included this movie. I eagerly watched all the other movies and material in the collection, but left SUPERMAN RETURNS in the box. A few years later, I took it out to give it a second chance. I still didn't like it. Just recently however, in June 2013, I had a friend over to my house for a full day of Superman TV shows and movies, in preparation to go see MAN OF STEEL. She told me she never saw SUPERMAN RETURNS, so, I reluctantly took it out of the set and put it on for her. This time, some six years after the fact, I really enjoyed this movie. It was like I saw it for the first time. I can now appreciate what director Bryan Singer was up against at the time. SUPERMAN RETURNS Takes place five years after the events of SUPERMAN 1978, Although in reality, this movie came out 28 years later after the fact. Times have changed, as well as filmmaking technology, and so the movie has a much darker look than the original. The characters are much more serious, and there's just not that sense of fun that was in that original Superman movie. Get over that, and you have a very good, well - enacted story, with superb production values. It's like seeing one of the new Daniel Craig 007 movies, versus one of the earlier Sean Connery or Roger Moore efforts. Worlds apart, but excellent just the same. If you, like me, got a copy of this, but haven't taken it out recently, give it a second or even third viewing. You may find out, that it'll grow on you!
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I think everyone has already seen this movie, so there's not much point in reviewing it. Read the book, it's better.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The book wrapped up quite nicely, the series overall was well worth the month and a half it took to read all of the books. I would recommend them to anyone.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|And making the album that should have come after Promised Land. Thank you!!!<br /><br />I give this four stars for the very reason that I cannot put this on par with \\"Rage for Order\\" and \\"O:M\\".  Those are unequivocal five star albums.  If the rating system allowed me to give this four and a half.  Todd LaTorre sounds fantastic here.  I'm hoping these guys stop nearby for a tour soon, and hope they pick the sole good song off \\"Frequency Unknown\\" and play it better than Geoff \\"I've gone Psycho\\" Tate.
B00A88FLI0|5.0|Perfect Lego Set!  My 7 year old son loved it! Would recommend to any child who enjoys Lego, especially Ninjago Lego!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like it but it could really do with out the ads new places to chose from. Other than all of that I personally think that its fairly good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|at first it was boring so I repeated it. but I wanted it again so I downloaded it again. I got my profile recovered with 128 gems. I only had 20 when I deleated it. but now I love it
B008602KQI|5.0|If you are buying the book, but all three, you'll enjoy it that much. Seriously tough, at this point in time it probably wouldn't take too long to get at the library to check out before you buy anything.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is a nice game and is.really fun and the characters are funny and kid friendly Rome was fun and I like the spray paint on the subway
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Very engaging language is used to paint a vivid landscape in your mind.  Decent story that wanders sometime without a &#34;real&#34; ending.  Thought there would be more plot twists but none ever really materialized. Good time killer or a real good read for teens/pre-teens.  I liked it but not as much as I liked his previous books (american gods, neverwhere, the graveyard book, etc.).
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|this game is very tricky, whenever you start the game it asks if you would like to rate it so your finger unconsciously goes towards the &quot;later&quot; button, but a few seconds after the ratings button pops up a bigger add pops up over so half the time you click the add, I have played this game for a while and this has been annoying me since I started.
B005KJ6ECY|5.0|got my dvds this morning n I put it on to watch straight away I can perv at jonathan rhys Meyers anytime I want now mmmmmmm
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Ok parents who rated it one star bc of kids buying stuff, it's gives a warning in the description, and you really plugged you're credit card in to a account you're kids. Play on? It was just waiting to happen
0425263908|5.0|We all know that the 50 Shades of Grey books are great.  Loved the price.  Yes, I loved the book.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Great soundtrack.<br /><br />Love Christina, nice variety and great dance tunes.<br /><br />I got this as a gift for my daughter who's grown to also love Christina.
B008VBYN80|3.0|Kinda lame, I was hoping for more. The  purchaseable content is outrageously expensive. Don't waste your time with this one
B00C7O8TSM|3.0|Audio quality and just the general overall sound is just ok. Older live albums I have of this group sound much better. Bought for collection as this may be their last album. The group back together for this tour is just not the same without Dennis and Carl and Brian in his prime.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Seriously this is without any question one the BEST METAL CD I have ever heard.  I cannot image it gets much better than this.  Do not delay get this CD immediately.  I pray BS keep on making records this fuggin awesome.  PERFECTION!<br /><br />This whole album is great but Damaged Soul is complete eargasm.
B004X75RCW|4.0|I've watched this with my wife twice now, and it's pleasantly funny each time.  The characters and their relationships with each other aren't entirely spelled out, but they are stock enough that you get the idea.  This movie is exactly what it intends to be from start to finish, and is well presented.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|game is fun and interesting. I was able to co.plenteous levels in a day. looking forward to more levels. have a good day and best of luck in your gaming adventures
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I have never read a book in this format before.  It was very episodic.  Don't get me wrong it was an enjoyable read, the detail in which the author imagined how a Zombie would react with real world dynamics was amazing.  My history of Zombie movies/books/games have all been somewhat monotone... land based fast/slow moving zombies in droves and the characters fighting for their lives in shells of cities or buildings.  The Author does a great job of bringing the Zombie creature into our world, in almost every environment, there were times in the book where I took a moment and said &#34;well I never thought of that.&#34;
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|I hope this is not the last of the series! There must be many more to tell and I am sure there are plenty of Nalini Singh's readers out there who would be unhappy in the extreme if this is the last in the series.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I love the English shows. This was one series I could not see  and I would forget to set the recorder.<br />Thanks
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cord works perfectly. As much as I enjoy my Kindle Fire, without this functional cord it wouldn't be fun for long. I especially like that the cord prongs fold in making it easy to store and travel with it.
B0046B3QTG|2.0|One or two funny things throughout this dull movie.  Minions only thing worth watching...like old looney toons.  Maybe the second movie will be better.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellently written, great performances, good wholesome story... it will give you lots to talk about with whomever you watch it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Simply a great read, well written, fast moving, and easy to connect with the characters.  I liked it so much I have read it more than once and for me that is a lot.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This puzzle brought me back to the days of Myst. Fantastic graphics with challenging puzzles and a mysterious twist. I am looking forward to future chapters.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|It was a different angle with the adult being in peril. The story line was interesting. It was challenging without being too hard.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Excellent movie and its a very good price, highly recomended! Another Tarantino's Masterpiece. If You are a Tarantino's fan, You won't be dissapointed!
4805311193|5.0|This book is very well written and explains the main events that characterize the Shinsengumi and it's function from its inception until its end.  It also includes the reasons for what happened, how they happened, and who, why, and what the people involved did in the last years of the Shogun.<br /><br />It explains how the era of the Shogun ended and the era of the emperor began.<br /><br />The book is easy to read and very interesting all the way through.  For anyone interested in knowing what happened at that time, this is highly recommended.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I haven't tried it yet but its related to other games that I have so I hope it is fun
B00CF34B2I|2.0|When I try to download this app to my kindle it downloads then stops and it will never let me download it .
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|Downloaded yesterday and was working great but today I cannot load the game. Very disappointed, it was also shutting down when I was trying to go get my first dinosaur last night. Will try again in a few days to get in, if it doesn't work then I am going to remove.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Hosseini  again captures the reader and takes him through a finely woven  tapestry. of interlacing characters and stories. Sometimes the reader has difficulty following, but feels compelled to continue on this journey because of Hosseni's skill as a storyteller.
B00130EVSS|4.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot and found it in the same vein as A History of Violence and Killing Them Softly. It's not nearly as violent as I expected which was nice, and was actually an interesting character study. Would recommend to anyone who is interested in a Scorcese like genre without quite as much graphic violence.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A friend recommended that I watch Downton Abbey and I am now addicted to the series.  Downton has great writers and a storyline that moves at a pace that keeps me interested.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I found the game to be exactly what I expected - a cute, fun distraction while I waited in the dentist's office. It was Amazon's Free App of the Day when I downloaded it, but I beleive it would be worth the purchase price.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This is a good alarm clock, but the advertisements are a little annoying.  It's a shame that the app icon always says 8:10, can be misleading sometimes.
0307742997|1.0|Over 500 pages of thriller by numbers. Boring read, dreadful translation. By the time you reach the end, you'll wonder why you bothered.
B004LZRSBY|5.0|The Final Concert, &#34;Going out on a High Note&#34;, is the perfect description of this concert. I never got to see them live in the 80s so this was my chance to see them and hear the. Although they are most likely in their 40's they still had the energy and emotional connection to their fans with their music. Plus they can still sing, especially the lead singer with his high notes. I highly recommend this Blu Ray concert,
B0062OCNAI|5.0|I read Sister and couldn't put it down so I went on to read Afterwards. Rosalind Lupton is absolutely unbelievable.  Her writing keeps you glued to your seat and you just can't put this book down.
B00BLGXL3U|4.0|Sick with style but not for everyone, a genuine masterpiece in its own right. Thought provoking dialogue and great cinematography.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I'm so glad these movies are all together in one box as a blu ray set. This is a perfect collection & I will watch it over & over.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|I bought this movie because I was on an 80's movie kick for awhile. I do not know why but I love movies made in the 80's and can't get enough of them! Highly recommended.
B0086449YA|5.0|What an amazing production and the writing just gets better and better, MK.<br /><br />I seriously have played this CD to death.<br /><br />Favourite tracks - Red Bud Tree, Privateering, and Seattle.<br /><br />Fantastic!<br /><br />10 stars!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|kill scientists, break into factory, what more could you want. oh you steal a jetpack made of machine guns and kill the scientists who created it with it...
B0034GK7DM|5.0|The young George Strait has a great future ahead of him.  I highly recommend this cd for all George Fans.
0385333846|5.0|Completely in love with this story telling style, fresh and poignant as well and hilarious it's a full on connection to the human psyche; artfully done.
B003FFEX8C|2.0|Watched this movie as a companion to the podcast, &#34;How Did This Get Made?&#34;, which takes bad movies and talks about them in detail. They were spot on with this film!<br /><br />Halle Berry gives a lukewarm performance as the title character, taking her co-stars along for the ride. In fact, the only person in the film that makes her character watchable is Sharon Stone, and that's only because she appeared to have fun chewing the scenery!<br /><br />Combine very poor CGI, a plot created by throwing letters at a wall until they formed words, and just plain bad acting and you get this gem. Watch it for the pure schlock of it all, and make sure to listen to the podcast after!
0439023513|5.0|I got addicted to the Hunger Games and wanted to read the books before I watched the movies. I would highly recommended these books! They are an easy read and great for anyone!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was well written, fast paced and held your interest from page 1. This was much more than a courtroom drama or your typical criminal case story. It is at its core about the ties that bind families and the unequivocal love we have for our children.  I really enjoyed this book!
0062086529|5.0|Great original book of Harold and Purple Crayon because its a board book so great of young students as its harder for them to bend and ruin pages and  easier for them to hold.
B0015GDVTU|5.0|This is a true modern love story.  I love the shots of Ireland/Scotland.  It makes me want to travel outside my safe United States.  There is a dancing Butler scene that is a must see.  Mr. Butler took on the part of Gerry and made him come to life.  Hillary is a good job of the nagging, grieving widow.  We shouldn't take people for granted for we are only here for a little while.
1590171993|5.0|Best prose I have ever read and should ever hope to, a book about nothing special, but leaves you captivated all the way. A real unique honesty that is hard to express.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I got this game free from Amazon's Daily Free App, but I would definately have paid for it. The puzzle is based on a cube of tiles that you have to spin in all directions to match, and the tiles progress down to the center of the cube. Whittle down the cube to win the puzzle!<br /><br />Pick it up - it's great to play for just a few minutes at a time, or for longer sessions!
6305428050|5.0|I bought this movie because I was on an 80's movie kick for awhile. I do not know why but I love movies made in the 80's and can't get enough of them! Highly recommended.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is a novel that was both heartwarming and surprising.  The author goes back and forth between WWII and present times to tell a story that  was interesting, and so meaningful.  The characters were very well written and I will definitely look for other books by this author.  Also I was truly surprised at the twist in the end of the book.  One of the best books I've read in a long time and I read a great deal.
B000069HK2|5.0|Great screamo album, right up there with early Saosin, Silverstein, HH, and the like. Buy this album if you love music from this epoch.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Wonderful easy to use and has large numbers for ease on my eyes. Also free is awsom. Highly recommend this.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you liked the fifty shades series you'll love this first book. About to pick the second book up I cannot get enough!!!!<br /><br />Finished this book in a day....definitely did not want to put it down!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This is a great story about the mistakes,tragedies and lessons life can behold. It is a heartwarming story of a young man's struggle with mental illness and how he retains that sometimes elusive sliver of hope that propels him to move forward. I really enjoyed reading this book and would surely recommend it to others.
B00005KARK|5.0|Who does not love Disney movies? I love them all and hope to own them someday to share with my children.
B0087WRGVY|5.0|If you're a fan of 80s hard rock and metal you will love this album. Great guitar playing and riffs, plenty of hooks and strong songwriting, Excellent vocals!
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|I honestly can't think of any movie to compare Side Effects too because it's so unique. If you like conspiracy theories at all, rent or buy this movie! It's definitely worth at least one watch through. And it's a lot better than most of the new releases at the time of writing this.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|The movie is a modern version of an old theme that is very well acted by Denzel Washington.  I would class the story as a tragedy equal to many that are considered classics.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I can't understand why this movie has a high rating. There is so many parallel dialogs that this movie seems to be intentionally trying to erase you mind. I may not be Siskel or Ebert but I think this movie could have ended about 45 minutes to an hour sooner and saved me the trouble of being bored for half the movie.
B00AEBBA9U|5.0|The ultimate movie presented in the best home format ! BLURAY!<br />Looks great, sounds great. I own this movie on Laser disc and dvd, seen it many times on TV. It has never looked like this. Great supplementary material.
B000FZETIO|5.0|I bought this movie because I was on an 80's movie kick for awhile. I do not know why but I love movies made in the 80's and can't get enough of them! Highly recommended.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|To find a program that is well-written and acted.  This is one!  Can't wait until season 3 is out. Yeah!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I read a lot and I bought this because the pup on the cover reminded me of our beloved Golden Retriever, Remington Noelle. I lost my husband and our Remi and grieve daily for them. Somehow this book helped me.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|My cousin in Tennessee was not able to get out to see this movie in theaters so when part 2 went to dvd I sent her both parts as a \\"I love my cousin\\" gift. She loved, loved, loved them! I did good!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Perfect game<br />Thank you<br /><br />For giving us this game. It pure fun and lots to do.For all ages and keeps you on your feet.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have been using this application since beta and on the rare occasions that I am forced to use the stock android keyboard I remember why I love this so much. Fast, dependable prediction and great overall layout.<br /><br />Enough said!
B000065V3H|5.0|I bought this movie because I was on an 80's movie kick for awhile. I do not know why but I love movies made in the 80's and can't get enough of them! Highly recommended.
B001TH16DI|5.0|To take back the original Star Trek was a joy that I had no reason to relive but did so willingly.
B00701QRI6|5.0|I'm not sure why Santana 3 doesn't get more press. I listened to it back when it was first released on vinyl and loved it and recently bought it again to add to my Santana CD collection. Santana's first album and their second, Abraxas, are both spectacular albums, with Santana 3 following right along behind them. You can hear their latin, rock fusion style maturing with this collection of songs, and they seem to be experimenting a little more.  Santana's execution of the rhythms and melodies seems more relaxed (their first two albums established them as consummate musicians with their intense, complex and precisely orchestrated execution) and they are having more fun with their music on this album. If you are a Santana fan and have any reservations about this album, listen the sample songs and see if you don't agree that Santana 3 is one of their very best!
B000W91RUG|5.0|This was used, I could not tell...I watch it over and over and it seems fine to me.  I love it!
B006LSZECO|4.0|During the first part of the book, you get drawn into the story and are kept guessing as to the truth. During the second half of the book, you may be shocked by the truth and then are kept guessing as to how that will play out. The ending may also come as a surprise. This story was very unique and the author really put a lot of thought into it to create such an elaborate story. It's a little frightening, but in a good way. I could barely put the book down.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|It's a great show, and the quality of the video was surprisingly good for Amazon Instant Video. Usually, I have issues with the video stopping or getting stuck, but this was really smooth.
B00005JKHN|5.0|I love Disney movies and want to own them all some day. It is a great movie for a little girl who loves princesses.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Very lightweight and sturdy. I especially like the elastic band that makes sure the cover stays in place. My Kindle snapped in very easily and I have not had any problems
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|It wasn't funny, just very, very sad. I couldn't watch past the first 30 minutes. I definitely wasted my money.
0930289234|5.0|One of my personal favorite graphic novels. I loved the movie but loved the book more. Kind of makes you hate life though...
B0087JTAKW|3.0|I enjoy Mitch Albom's books and fell in love with others such as The Five People You Meet In Heaven, For One More Day, and Tuesdays with Morrie. I had high expectations for this book but was left dissapointed. Not one of Albom's best. It's an 'okay' story. Felt a little 'flat'. I was not impressed. However, it is an easy-read; so, if you like Mitch Albom and are curious, there's nothing to lose but a little bit of time.
0316069434|5.0|I have been a Michael Connelly fan since I read his first novel.  His character Harry Bosch is still as crusty and lovable as ever.  Looking forward to Michael's next book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game I love it.  kids and adults will enjoy.  hope they add more levels. my daughter and I love it,!!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have read the Hunger Games books multiple times and enjoy them equally every time! I highly recommend reading this series! They are very entertaining, and I couldn't put any of them down.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I wish it followed up a little more at the end. Maybe that's what imaginations are for, bit a stretch none the less
B001ILFUDC|5.0|Bought this for my daughter as a replacement for the VHS version. So glad we did. She loves to watch it.
B00CLZ48FA|1.0|This is a great movie but Amazon doesnot let you download the movie.  You therefore MUST have a constant wifi connection or you cannot watch the movie.  So much for being able to use your purchase &#34;on-the-road&#34; and NO refunds!!!!  It SUCKS!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever their is no better game than minecraft  if you get the game you will love it for life!!!!!!
B008FOB124|5.0|Fantastic album, a must have for DCD fans. It's got several haunting and beautiful songs that will become classics in the years to come. I'm so glad Brendan and Lisa got together again for this tour and album.<br /><br />Paul Genesse
B008M721MS|1.0|It doesn't work most of the time.........very frustrating.....I bought this to keep in touch with my grandchildren and that has been very infrequent
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Honestly, I was embarrassed for the actors right from the start. Silly dialog, horrible acting,esp. Miley...but, she is a pretty good bad witch. Franco smiles way to much at nothing. I only watched the entire movie to get my $ worth. But that's just me.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|I LOVE this app -- as does my husband & daughter!  It's the coolest thing & I absolutely recommend it!
0691130272|5.0|The book met my expectations. In fact, being very useful. I recommend it as a stepping the issue. Good buy.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|Sounded like Boz and it was good.  It did not replace Clapton, but good sounds.  That's all.  Please no more
B001NA6096|5.0|I love this movie so much. I've watched it many times over the years. My wife and I watched it, and the second one, Before Sunset, just before we went to the theater to watch Before Midnight (the third movie). It so brilliantly written and acted.<br /><br />Paul Genesse
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like the game but could do without the lame music. Should be able to kill music and keep sound effects.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I am a Star Trek fan from the very beginning. The series  and the movies are written so that any age can watch and enjoy them.  A must have for my movie collection.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I Love this game!! I really enjoy playing it! I can't wait for more levels. I Hope they come soon!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Loved the movie. I laughed. I cried. I will watch this one again. Going to be a classic for me.
B000Q67876|5.0|For pure entertainment  you can not beat this movie. Just when you think you have figured out what is going on guess what - you haven't. It's hard to believe that this was written by Stephen King. It's not really a who done it movie and it's not about revenge. well you'll have to watch it to find out what it's really about. I bet you'll watch it more than once. I have and you get more out of each time.I highly recommend this movie for your collection.
B004EPZ070|5.0|My daughter and I love this movie!  We have watched it at least a dozen times!  There is nothing about it that we dislike.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I didn't really know anything about this series or the actors, but I checked it out one night when I was bored and I love it.  The main character, Alicia, is a wonderful, multi-dimensional, intelligent woman who has to deal with a lot.  I don't want to talk about the plot because either you already know the idea of the story, or you will find out when you watch.  I am a picky TV show watcher, and I really enjoy this one.  It has drama, intrigue, revenge, politics, working mom stuff, love triangles, sexiness and humor.  I think it's a great summer show for those days and nights when it's too hot to do anything at all.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I have seen all the Harry Potter movies,  These are a birthday gift for my sister-in-law who is a big big fan and has not seen all the movies because my dear brother did not want to go see them.  I have also ordered a set for myself and seeing them  in blu-ray at home makes the awsome. Can not wait until my 2 little grandchildren get big enough to enjoy them also
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|I have followed the Lois McMaster Bujold series on the Vorkosigan saga for many years. This novel was not quite what I expected, as I had become accustomed to the main character \\"Miles\\" shenanigans.  Surprisinly, it was very refreshing and entertaining to read about his cousin Ivan.  Kudos! On taking the next step in develping this world while not-quite-leaving Miles behind.
B00CVCHJ6I|5.0|Great music!!! Always providing the best music possible which unbelievable talent year in and year out. Highly recommend this album. DARK TRANQUILLITY!!!
B00B29J0I6|5.0|This is a great game. You not only get to have a fun time with colorful graphics and movement. But, this game makes you think about how gravity and physics work. You have Roby the Robots head and you have to get it ready for shipping. Different set-ups of boxes and balancing beams block you from getting his head to the shipping box. Meanwhile, between the head and the box are 3 stars that you can collect for points. This game will challenge you and bring you hours of fun. It's a blast!!!
B003M6FGTE|5.0|And very  good entertainment.These young adults ARE so talented.The characterizations are well played.And the choreography is just amazing. The script is funny.
1612191290|1.0|Just a short comment.  I am an economics major, I have read \\"Das Capital\\" which provides my insight into \\"Debt: The First 5,000 years.\\"  The later book is largely an application of several Marxian theories to the study of Debt.  Most notably 'commodity fetishism', that the social relationships underlying economic exchanges carry greater importance,henceforth in Graeber's view all debt exchanges merely mask much more important abusive social relationships.  Even worse Graeber  stubbornly maintains the 'labor theory of value' so he can maintain that a surplus value is extracted from laborers, in a purely Marxian fashion.  Ignoring all progress in economic theory form the last 150 years.  Graeber also takes the exchange forms C-M-C' and M-M' from Marx.  Therefor it is my firm belief that this book is only suited for anthropologist and should not be read by anyone interested in economics.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|I tried every way but I couldn't get this game to work. It did not work on my sister's IPad either. So that is why I rated it 1 star. It was fun before the update. All I saw was the video.
B004WR125O|2.0|the Item would  possible be ok to use if the receiver was operational,but never was able to be applied or demo
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that I can have this app read the Bible to me and I love but it will remind me to do my daily reading plan.
B00114RKT8|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I never knew of this man, but now I have a new respect and admiration for what he did in his day.  Such a moving story of this man and the influence of God on his life.  Well worth my time.  Thank you for the movie.
B008DBF5Z8|4.0|a nice presentation and scanning tool...very useful so far;  I enjoy the compact aspect and the flexible arm that allows me to define better what gets shown.
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|Watch the entire series.  This one builds on itself and is pretty deep (no pun intended) as Star Trek goes.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game im so addicted to this game. I cant stop playing it and there's no advertisements and it doesn't crash. This is a great game.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|it is a really great game. only wish thing were cheaper when starting out, other than that good game. love it
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Ihis app is great for organizing ideas and lists.  It has a widget so that I can access certain notes straight from my home page for quick note taking.  Also I can share to Gmail or messaging so that I can send something to someone quickly.  It doesnt let me attach photos though, I would love if it would do that.  (that's the only reason I detected a star)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I say this game is simple in a good way. It has easy to follow directions and  games and it does not require you to buy things or make it impossible to play without the gems.<br />The only problem I have with it is the fact that I don't know how/ don't think you can change yourself into a female rider/caretaker
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a fun and appropriate game for kids even for my age ,twelve.<br />I would recommend this game for anyone.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|It is a well written horror story without too much imagination, really.  It is not a book I would ever want to read again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very entertaining game. You get to escape from a number of locked rooms through finding clues and solving puzzles. Highly recommended to puzzle lovers. Mind twisting fun.
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|For the type of movie that it was, it actually had a plot and a good storyline. I was entertained! Just a consideration, but i would watch a \\"part 2\\".
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I actually prefer just going to the website on my phone and on my tablet. The app just doesn't allow full use of Facebook.  I would like to be able to edit my profile and photo albums from the app.
6305428042|5.0|I love this movie. One of my favorite Halloween traditions. I watched this movie every Halloween growing up. Love it!
159463176X|5.0|I loved this book and really hated for it to end. Much as the girl in the National Geographic picture presented a face of Afghanistan to the world, Mr. Hosseini's storytelling brings a picture of the people of that country to life. I felt that I understood these characters and their history. I recommend this book to everyone.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is the best product I have found for making list and taking notes. It is very easy to share.
B000003CMB|5.0|I love the Allman Brothers Band and this CD is a really good one.  People who like the Allman Brothers Band  will like this one.
159463176X|5.0|Once again, Khaled Hosseini has written a book about the gentle people of a country torn by decades of war.  We see a people for who they are, not the people that have had their spirits ravished by the ugliness of their world.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|AMAZING ALBUM! Thanks J Cole for bringing hip hop BACK! Honest, raw, amazing music! I am truly a fan, and TRULY YOURS J Cole!!!! ;-D
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a fun app for those who can't own horses such as myself. Only trouble is it seems to slow down on its own. But other than that worth the time.
B0085RQLXK|1.0|Its been a looooong time since Rocks and Toys in the Attic-I can't believe this the same band. I even kind of liked Honkin on Bobo for their recent stuff-but this is all filler-nothing stands out at all. They should have done sooo much better.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I could not put the book down.  The characters are real to me now and I can't wait til I have some more free time to sit down and read more of the tale.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time! Absolutely loved it and was worth the money I paid! :)
B002PMV9FG|5.0|I love the harry potter movies, they are so amazing. I love the series. Original. Great movies. I want them all.
B005SHTXN0|4.0|Cruz is surprisingly sensitive and Hoffman is just amazing!! Comment seemed enough for me but had more words required! What kind of reverse censorship is that?? Good way to lose raters!
B00BSBY38A|4.0|We downloaded this Amazon movie because the commercials for it looked so awesome.  It was a good movie and the subject matter was unique.
B004S7VQT0|4.0|A very interesting book. Written as a narrative from the viewpoint of the protagonist with an ending very open to interpretation. My Book Club read this and the resulting discussion was very interesting as we were split down the middle in terms of interpreting the outcome of the story. An excellent discussion-starter for our current international political situation.
B008PZYZH6|3.0|This show is pretty good.  Good cast, but the script is a bit predicable.  If you like these actors, you'll like the movie....
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I am a Cut the Rope fan from way back.  It can be a time vacuum for me...I look up and hours have passed.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|This is a great background story for a great character.  Just finished on my kindle. and I have to say it keeps u on the edge of your seat the whole way through.  Perfect edition for any Lee Child fan.  Next for me is the new one on  september 3rd.
B0083DJUMA|4.0|without doubting the enthusiasm of American futurists and entrepreneurs, I have reservations about the scale of social changes envisaged, the metaphor being 3d printing. I'm not a Luddite but do come from the smog of those dark satanic mils and thus have a skepticism about panaceas.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I watched this using my prime membership. It was free. I had read the books previously. As always, the book was much more complete than the movie. The books were written for teenagers and I found all three of them to be lacking in the writing. I believe this came through in the film. The premise is one set in the future where the inhabitants of the country Panem must give up a small group of teens to compete in a fight to the death. The whole ordeal is televised to the nation as a game. The winner is allowed to live and treated as a hero. The whole reason for this game is a sacrifice to the country for a passed uprising against the central government. I don't understand why they call it the \\"hunger games\\" because the game has nothing to do with finding food or being hungry. Having said that, for free it was entertaining and passed the time. If you haven't read the books you may be a little confused during some flashbacks sequences wondering what the film is trying to show/tell you. Overall it's worth watching if you enjoy movies about futuristic societies and the way they subjugate their people. In future books/movies there is an uprising against the central government against the games and the central government. You see small signs of this developing in this film.
B00COGXX7A|4.0|This movie was tender and slightly suspenseful. It has some violence and love scenes. Over all I rate it a four star. It is also somewhat predictable.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|Love this game.  It plays fast and I can pick it up any time.  I find it relaxing for some reason.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I think Hosseini is an excellent writer.  I have read his other books.  In comparison, this book is very good, but I do not think it is as good as The Kite Runner or A Thousand Splendid Suns.  His books not only have a good story line, but are very educational.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The writer has skills, but this story does not flow and jumps around to the point I forgot who I was reading about.  No real Protagonist..  Good prose, just not story outline.  The editor should give refunds I guess they cashed in on recent success....
1416589473|5.0|I just got this in the mail today, and I am so very excited! It is in perfect condition, and has that new book smell I am so fond of! I can't wait to read it, the back paragraphs already have me itching to open it and start reading. Thanks so much!
B006KX3GXO|3.0|I haven't played with it much, but his app works great for enhancing photos and getting creative. It let's me design photos on the fly. Fun for the novice.
B00CATSONE|3.0|Once I got into it I enjoyed it.  I almost didn't finish it because it was so difficult got me to get into. The first couple of chapters were really dry and uninteresting to me.  I had a hard time 'wading' through that first part.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|As a fan from the beginning, this is the record I've been waiting for since Promised Land.  Queensryche has their sound back and have proven that Tate was what was holding this band back for the past 20 years.
B008ETOSYI|2.0|Very boring and slow paced. Actors seem to have few lines to speak and they are quite emotionless. The book was a lot more engaging and descriptive.
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|Great action pack game against other people of the world for free best game ever everyone should have this game the more people the merrier this is the only game I cared to write a review about
B0016OM3TU|5.0|IMHO, most reviewers are putting too much emphasis on the jazz side and content of this movie, failing to realize that the jazz back story is just incidental. There is much more to \\"'Round Midnight\\" than just jazz - even though there is a lot of TOP QUALITY jazz there. You don't even have to like jazz to like this movie (even though I think one has to be an ogre not to float on the clouds with the magnificent soundtrack put together by Herbie Hancock and played in modest, nearly anonymous, but unsurprisingly superb cameo performances by the likes of Wynton Marsalis, John McLaughlin, Wayne Shorter, Freddie Hubbard, and of course, Herbie Hancock and Dexter Gordon themselves - not to mention Lonette McKee's AWESOME rendition of \\"How Long Has This Been Going On?\\").<br /><br />But \\"'Round Midnight\\" is NOT a musical, nor is it about music, musicians or jazz, and if you just want to listen to its (fabulous and Oscar-winning) music, you can buy the CD instead, or download its tracks. What makes it such an outstanding film that hasn't got old almost 30 years later, and the reason why it's one of my all-time favorite movies, is the sensible way it portrays the beautiful friendship of two men from very different backgrounds. When I want to show someone what my definition of TRUE friendship is - not mere \\"social acquaintance\\" - I tell them to watch this movie and see the lengths French fan and friend Francis Borler goes to for his idol Dale Turner, an African American saxophonist who, like many of his peers in the 1950s, flees racism and discrimination in his own country by going to Paris, where they were more accepted for their music. Among other things, Francis humiliates himself with his ex-wife, confronts the police and even beats up a drug dealer! I would be capable of doing things like those as well for my true friends (well, maybe not the beating up the drug dealer part...), so I see a lot of myself in Francis.<br /><br />While full of (spectacular) music, this is not a film about music or jazz; it's a film about human nature - and about the better part of it. Just this sets this movie apart - there are LOTS of movies about the worse part of human nature, but not many about its good side that don't fall into the abyss of kitsch and cheesiness. Bertrand Tavernier did that magnificently. Human nature can create Hitlers, but it can also create sublime music, as well as bridges between all kinds of cultural and personal differences, in the name of friendship, shown as a form of love - Socratic love, that intense and special bond that can exist between two men, without any homosexual undertone (in spite of the expression having been used as a euphemism for that in the past).<br /><br />See, for example, how Francis's little daughter Berang&egrave;re at first is hurt for feeling neglected by her dad, but eventually understands, appreciates and partakes in her father's devotional friendship to Turner. Berang&egrave;re is a little like us, spectators. And Turner is idolized only up to a certain extent: Francis is an artist himself, albeit of a different kind (a graphic designer), and he is moved above anything by gratitude for the personal growth that Turner's music had catalyzed in him, but he doesn't fail to acknowledge Turner's many flaws, starting with a bad case of alcoholism, self-destructing tendencies, and only relative gratitude. Instead of reproaching his friend, Francis helps him overcome his problems, but keeping in mind that the ultimate choices are Turner's and no one else's, which becomes very much evident at the end.<br /><br />And yes, Dexter Gordon's acting as Dale Turner is surprising and outstanding, as much as his sax playing. Pity that we only had this movie to enjoy it, as his acting talent was discovered only in his old age, and he died shortly after completing this movie.<br /><br />Those who are not used to the European style of cinema may find the movie boring, because its pace is definitely slow, with lots of dialogue interspersed with long silent shots, and psychological atmosphere. Those who are used to it, or who are willing to open their minds, will find this movie beautiful and sensible, and it will give you food for thought for a lifetime. I couldn't recommend it more emphatically!spersed with long silent shots, and psychological atmosphere.

B007A2O3FO|3.0|This was not a bad movie, though not like Downton Abbey, it is a period piece and is entertaining, a supernatural theme.
B00782O7IY|5.0|Fantastic silent feature that mingles playfulness and humor with dark drama. Highly recommend this film for anyone who loves classic films and is at all interested in the golden age of Hollywood and the stories of people in the industry at the time.
B00BG0RSJ4|5.0|I bought this movie for my two year old granddaughter and she LOVES it! She has now seen the movie at least ten times and would watch it every day if her Mother would let her.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This little android utility scans for WI-Fi networks and shows you how strong they are and what channel they are using.  It suggests the best channel assignment for the WI-Fi network it's on.  That allowed me to reconfigure our network so that it was not being interfered with by our neighbors' networks.
B009JZTP4Y|2.0|I was very disappointed in this and didn't finish watching it.  Too much time showing them entering the space cloud - there was no story, at least what I had seen.  Great actors with not much to do except watching the cloud.  This would have been better as a 30 minute tv show, then there might have been some action.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Definitely not for the faint-hearted, but what an amazing ride. You'll wish you wore your straitjacket! What will they have in store for next season!?!
B00881VLCE|4.0|Pretty good app. The only things I'd love to see added are a lefty setup option and the ability to change the background color.
B00C2U6EUG|5.0|I am a huge fan of the original Superman films of Christopher Reeve....3 out 4 anyway, and I NEVER thought I would enjoy a Superman theme as much as John Williams' CLASSIC score. Hans hit one out of the park with this one. Don't get me wrong, he and John Williams scores are very different, but any great score has got to fit its movie and that is exactly what Zimmer did with Snyder's grittier take on Superman. In fact, I think it's safe to say that I enjoyed the score more than the movie.

B005SHTXN0|5.0|Very entertaining. A man who thought he had everything learns he has a brother after his father's death and kidnaps his brother to get his brother's share of the inheritance but has a change of heart after he gets to know his brother.  Great acting!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|This app is perfect. I can read my feeds on my iPhone and on my Mac and on the kindle. The most recent update here fixes all the issues. It works perfectly!
B0062NAVXA|5.0|Courageous is a must see movie!  It is the best inspirational movie I have seen since the movie Fireproof!  You will not regreat buying and owning this movie!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|A fun addictive game of war in which you have to attack other player's.  Don't spend your stars!  Unless you wanna buy more.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|We watched this movie this spring.  The writing and acting are excellent.  The audio and video quality on Amazon's Instant Video service were also excellent.
B009FOBMBI|5.0|A great addition to any fans Music library of tunes enjoyed every track would recommend to any fan of three days grace
0547884591|5.0|This book is interesting...I'm not a stranger to cooking, but read through the book cover to cover and am working my way through many of the recipes in the book. There are a lot of interesting tidbits that seem thrown out from left field but that I got to read aloud to Erin so she could enjoy some trivia along with me.  There are definitely some things I'd like to try out for myself apart from the cooking.  It's a good manual for how to learn and I expect to reference it quite a bit at least in the near future; this seems the most immediately useable by anybody of his 3 books.<br /><br />I'm not sure that this book would be worthwhile for somebody that isn't interested in cooking at all, but if you are willing to experiment a little then it does lend itself to a good medium for education.
B000007MVD|5.0|&#62;Great set of discs by the legendary Beatles, featuring 69 tunes that display the wide range of talent the boys had, and from different periods in their recording career. Both discs feature many tunes by the group in the early days of their career: tunes that were take offs on Elvis, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Buddy Holly, for example. One can readily see that they generally had fun doing tunes that would not become major hits, but music that was highly entertaining and good.....and these were done live on a BBC program they appeared on.<br /><br />  Great stuff for any Beatles fan.

B0095VPAVE|5.0|I got this trinity core to build a computer for a friend who needed a machine to perform office duties as well as casual gaming on the side. I was reluctant due to the fact this APU is a CPU and GPU on a single die and was concerned about the architecture and heat output/voltage. However, most worries were squashed once I installed Windows 7 Ultimate. Most applications run crisp, and can also handle most games very well.<br /><br />This processor is probably most likely best bang for the buck within the Trinity line. However, if you have the extra $10~20, go for the A10 since it has slightly better frequency and better graphics unit.<br /><br />Runs DOTA and LOL comfortably at 60Hz at 1920x1080.

The APU is not strong enough to handle games at high settings and crossfiring with a 6670 or 6690 makes no sense. http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/radeon-geforce-stutter-crossfire,2995.html - AMD drivers are buggy at this point and will likely yield microstuttering. It is better to get a Benghazi cores with a medium line gpu. Also, make sure you get the A85 and a 1866mhz RAM to get full performance from the APU.<br /><br />For enthusiasts:<br /><br />Although A8-5600K is unlocked, do not overclock on the standard stock cooling that is issued with the APU. Although there are several website that claims you can increase the multiplier settings from 11x to a 14x and a voltage increase to a 1.5V, it actually brought worse performance when tested.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The Room was enjoyable, and I usually loathe puzzle games. The atmospheric music, incredible graphics, and the amazing structure of the game roped me in. This is not an atypical or mundane puzzle game that makes you focus. I look forward to more complex rooms.

1609611543|5.0|I do a pretty good job of eating healthy and I'm still relatively young, so I'm in what I consider to be good shape.  That being said, I still really enjoyed this book.  it's never too early to start healthy eating habits and I thought it was very interesting to read how there's such a misconception that most people have about \\"healthy whole grains.\\"  The health benefits of eliminating wheat are truly astounding in some cases, and even if you're in good health, I'd recommend giving this book a read.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Very cute family movie. My four and two year old enjoyed it. But some scenes may be scary for those more timid or who already have a fear of monsters in their closet.
B00ADS98FC|3.0|Got all settled in to rent this movie yesterday evening and found that I could only purchase it.  This is incredibly infuriating as I was all set to watch it and only wanted to spend at the most $4.99 to rent it.  I didn't consider it one I would want to own from the previews and I didn't get to see it in theaters.  I watched the trailer and decided that I did want to see it and $13.99 later the movie belonged to me.  I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  Having been in choir practically my entire life and even loving Glee as much as I have (until 4th season, then it got boring) I have to say it was right about the same in level of enjoyment.  I found myself bopping along to the beats and even singing along a couple of times.  It wasn't the best movie I've seen, but also not the worst.  Give it a watch, but rent it if you can.
B004XWLIJS|2.0|too violent and the plot was weak. did not really like the action scenes, but other than that a typical movie for this actor

193700788X|5.0|I just finished and I loved it!  Most of the loose ends were tied up, which was a miraculous feat by Charline Harris!  I finished with a great, positive feeling and hope that Sookie might really  be able to have a happy life in the future.  I am very glad that I have read and re-read all of these books over and over.  I completely enjoyed the ride and I am sure that I will read them all again and again.  Yes, the series was over the top, but that was the best part.  I don't kow why so many reviews were so negative, Sookie Stackhouse and all her friends and enemies were truly imaginative, fanciful fiction characters and Charline Harris tied up the package quite nicely- Thank you.
B00008J2PG|5.0|This old movie is typical of the oldies, good story, good acting. It is a little repetitive in places and slow, but the story is based on fact, a very brave man during WWII. I was a little surprised they didn't give the Pope more credit for saving lives. He actually gave much of the Vatican as a hiding place for Jews and others avoiding the Nazi- yet his reputation after the war was unfairly put down. This movie misses the chance to clear his name and it only has one hero the Priest. Still deserves a 5 star for over all film - an interesting, well done movie.
B0038YWPZS|5.0|I love this movie; I watch it all the time; and i never get tired of it. Great condition, great quality, and great features.

B001QWBM62|4.0|The H4N is an excellent 4 channel field recorder.  I use this when filming with a DSLR, as most do.  It's easy to use and monitor.  The XLR inputs do not defeat the on-board mics which is handy if you are going to get audio of a live performance (thing L-C-R).  The mic elements are good enough to use as primary audio in run-n-gun settings though I won't use them for interviews (I attach a pro grade shotgun mic or wireless lav via xlr to the H4N).  Of course, you lack time code so plan to sync as appropriate when filming (pluraleyes or a good clap and some patience).  All in all, I'm glad I have this versatile tool.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This is one i can play a few times, rather then be over it and delete it when im done. Good story line.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|This is one of those movies from my childhood that I just had to have. Good quality and in great condition.

B00785P2QC|3.0|My 9 year old son said it was okay but the game was confusing which resulted in the 3star rating.
B007H1HQW0|5.0|I did EXACTLY as the instructions said and read them COMPLETELY BEFORE trying to assemble or use this cutter.  I cut a total of 10 wine bottles in a very short period of time (considering I had never done this type thing before).  They all worked except 2.  I found out that it does not like to cut on wine bottles WHICH HAVE BEEN ETCHED.  In other words if there is not label and the label is actually etched into the glass they cut but were so lopsided I had to discard those 2.  However; since I an OCD, I did precisely as instructed and had great success.  Wonderful product and I highly recommend this.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Had a hard time getting into the story but I am glad I stayed with it. The ending is not what you would be expecting.

B00BWBHIUG|3.0|It's aa good app except for the dependency on pearls which are nearly impossible to get a substantial number of without purchase. Thinking of deleting because of it.

B00AHRWBH6|5.0|The Master Key system has been a pivotal experience in my life.  For three months I followed its guidelines and read a chapter each day for one week, at the minimum 5 days in any week.  It woke me up, I felt more awake and alive, realisations came to mind at unexpected times and I felt more conscious.  I felt more self confidence and joy in life.  My world changed from reading this book regularly.  I felt as though I had accessed the truth.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I crank up the dpi to 8000 for most games and I get the best accuracy ever. It's extremely comfortable. I am used to clawing mice instead of palming them, and with this mouse it doesn't really give my thumb much room so my thumb goes on the very left bottom where the buttons aren't. The side buttons are kind of far for my thumb to claw.  One thing that really bothers be is the entire right side of the mouse. To the right of the right click and down to the bottom is COMPLETELY GLOSSED. This makes my fingers that grip the right side very slippery and I'm adjusting my hand every minute or so because they've slipped out of place. I also think the mouse curve is a little too much for me, which is why my thumb can't reach the side buttons well. Overall it is a good gaming mouse with some flaws. The glossy side might actually make me buy a different mouse later on. If Anker changes this in a new model then I'll be extremely happy. But until then.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|Nothing beats an old fashioned Disney movie like this one. One of the originals in great quality and in great condition.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I had no idea this album existed. Then I bought it, and was completely upset at myself for not knowing it had existed at any point in the past.<br /><br />If you like anything muse has ever made, this album will almost literally blow you away. Madness, Survival, and Unsustainable have been the top of my playlist since I purchased this small nugget of human superiority.
B001O2QWB4|5.0|This item arrived on time and was as described.  The wolf cub was used as part of the decoration on a wolf edible image cake.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read it is amazing it should be for kids a little older
B000002URV|5.0|I love this album. It is very soothing and really relaxes me when I have had a stressful day. It also helps to inspire me when I am writing my stories.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Love the brainless Die Hard series. The last one was fantastic. This one was so godawful, it was hard to believe. Bruce Willis looked tired and uninterested, the actor who played the son was a snore. Not interesting, not good.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|And then had really amazing, mind-blowing, world-rending make-up-sex.<br /><br />This album is a strong contender for the first legitimate sale of Aural Sex to the masses.<br /><br />It's hard to describe how great the song Get Lucky is; you should probably just listen to it (you probably already have) and then just buy this album.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I love Charlaine Harris and her writing style!!  Of course The Sookie Stackhouse Series is also one of my favorites.  I waited in anticipationn for this book and it didn't disappoint!!  Loved it!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My review is based on subway surfers the game. It is fun and suitable for all ages. If you get this game you will not regret it and you will have fun playing it. Enjoy!
1475143389|1.0|This book is just like all the others out there giving you the same crap about what to do and what not to do. A complete waste of time and money.
1623420148|5.0|OMG this book had me in stitches. Love, love, love Drew!! I haven't read a whole book in a man's POV.  This was an excellent change from my norm.  I cannot wait for more books by Ms. Chase.
B006ZS7ZLS|5.0|I like every song on this album. That's relevant to you if you like chick rock, of which this is an album of.<br /><br />I'm particularly fond of Summertime Sadness and Born to Die, both of which are really awesome whiney soul-searching complaint songs, if you're into that sort of thing.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I have been a fan of Queensryche since 1984.  I always found a special connection to their music as though listening to it and singing along was like therapy.  But somewhere along the way the music changed and I tried to stay connected because I felt I needed to...but the feeling was not there.<br />The last year has put the fans in a lot of turmoil.  I didn't want to pick sides.. I just wanted to listen to music that blew me away.  And this album does that!  Once again I am sucked into the musical world of Queensryche and taken on a journey of song after song that fills me with emotion.  All day long the songs repeat in my head..beautiful melodic rock combined with thought-prevoking lyrics that intertwine perfectly.<br />Thank-you Scott, Michael, Ed, Parker and Todd for knowing what Queensryche means to us and delivering it on a silver platter.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Like omg dis game is like so addictive i was bored with at first but i was like it called my name over and over again til i jus had to beat it this game is so fun and amazing...super addictive
0399160450|5.0|I haven't read this novel yet but am giving it five stars because I know I know I will enjoy it because it is Tom Clancy and he is one of my favorite authors.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|What a phenomenal book.  After reading \\"The Kite Runner,\\" I knew I had to read this book.  It was a hard read because of the spousal abuse, but I knew I had to do it.  This book really tells us about life in a third-world country that has gone through war for many, many years.  It will tear at your heart strings and make you want to weep for the two women in the story, Lila and Miriam, who in our eyes had horrible lives.  But they knew great love and strength and faced life's challenges with fortitude and grace.  The book covers the social conflicts in the country as well as personal love and strife.<br /><br />There are a few books that you read in life that really grab your heart and this was one of those books.  Although I continually cringed while reading the book, I found I couldn't put it down.  My hat is off to Khaled Hosseini for helping us to learn of his country and its magnificent people.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|I really only listen to the song 'Sail'. It's a good song.<br /><br />I realize I could have purchased just the song. But only after I bought the entire album.<br /><br />It's pretty good if you're down with this sort of Electropunk music.<br /><br />By the way, I'm pretty sure either I just invented that genre, or miscategorized this into it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love this book must read. keeps you intertained from begining to end. Need to read the rest of the books to get the total effect.
1781162646|4.0|Fans of Stephen King novels who expect a supersized tome from this prolific and popular writer might think that Joyland is more appetizer than entr&eacute;e. They would be wrong. While it comes in at fewer than 300 pages, this is a complete and satisfying novel that provides enjoyable entertainment and reading pleasure. Protagonist Devon Jones spends a summer college break working at an amusement park while he grieves losing his girlfriend's affection. King develops Jones with great skill and draws readers into a crime novel plot that tells a great story. A boy suffering from muscular dystrophy serves as a medium for a spirit stuck on a ride in the amusement park. King sells so many books because he tells great stories, and this paperback crime novel is no exception.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (I like it)
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game. You find the animals on a safari and put them in your zoo. This game is for all ages. You must get this game.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|A skilled writer is always a pleasure to read. le Carre is certainly that. The mystery builds, surprising turns of events occur throughout. One doesn't want to stop reading. A most enjoyable read.
B003O6R2DK|5.0|Is the album. Seriously.<br /><br />It's like the Blade Runner of television.<br /><br />Sure, the actual performance was good; but the album is just so much better.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book is a great account of how the seal missions look and the dangers and misconceptions of the job and group. Very interesting account of the bin Laden raid
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|More than half of the fun of this book for me were the many, many references to games, books, movies, televisions shows, etc. that compose the fabric of this novel. The pacing moves the story briskly and the plot points stay one jump ahead of the reader. Cline provides a fun and satisfying read.
B000FCKC4C|3.0|Probably need to read it again but it was lacking &#34;something&#34;. Had a great message and characters. Just not quite there for me.
B001IMR7EQ|5.0|I highly doubt that anyone would happen upon the Rocky Horror Picture Show Film Album in a vacuum, having never seen the movie.<br /><br />However, in that unlikely case, you should:<br /><br />1) Not buy this album.<br />2) Go find and watch the film.<br />3) Repeat 2 like twice.<br />4) Notice you are compelled to purchase this album.<br />5) Buy this album.<br />6) Repeat 2 at least 4 more times per year for the rest of your life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is 5 stars me and my little sister enjoy this game. Who ever made subway surfer good job and keep up the good work!
B0002BO05S|5.0|I purchased this video as a gift for my dad. He loves watching it. I highly recommend it. And it truly is the greatest story ever told.
B005H9B2CE|3.0|The quality is horrible, Amazon discriminates against all tablet owners, except Kindle and ipad owners. Cancelling my prime account, waste of money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I watched this on Netflix and the quality was significantly better, the contrast was drastically better. Prime is a waste.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|okay so I love this game and its totally so much better the the first love that most of the basics are the same as the first but that pretty much everything else is new....now I would have given it a 5 star rating but it glitches really bad on my kindle and phone after you have achieved so much into the game fix that and it will a 5!!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I enjoyed this very much.story line good and graphics good. Not as many hidden objects, I love these types of games
B001TH16DI|5.0|Got this set  for my husband for his birthday.  He has enjoyed it!  He is a big Trek show/movie fan.
B00A4YZWN2|3.0|The ending to this thrilling series had its ups and downs. The use of different characters points of views brought the story together but i didn't find myself obsessed like with the other two books. Saying this though, if this final book wasn't made i would have always been left wondering....
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's pretty awesome! I love it. It's just like Temple Run,but in a subway. And it works perfectly in Kindle Fire!
B0015AARJI|5.0|I wasn't sure if it would work it fine when I bought it. I thought I would break on its first week, but it works fine.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I enjoyed playing with the little puzzles contained in this game. None were horribly difficult, but were instead fun and  lightly challenging. It ended too soon and the story line could be a bit more developed, but it was an overall enjoyable game.
B00D37UQ1K|1.0|This is the absolute worst adaptation of a book I have ever seen in my life. You expect the movie to be changed some,ie: shorter, some different dialog, but this movie is totally different throughout. It has the same basic plot, but after that, it is completely different. I am sorry I purchased this movie. I watched it once and I doubt if I will ever watch it again. Anyone who liked the book will hate the movie. My suggestion is to not even buy it. If you get a chance to see it for free, it might be worth your time, but not worth your money.
B00C5ZORES|3.0|On take this to your grave, years before save rock and roll, fob said \\"the songs you grow to like, never stick at first\\". I had no idea this would mean anything years later. So my initial impression was this cd is crap. I know fob has evolved alot as a band sence an evening out with your girlfriend but I waited four years for a album full of generic pop songs? I think its funny its called save rock and roll but this album is not at all the way to save rock and roll. BUT, regardless I love fob I had to give the album a chance. And after listening to it more and more and digging more into the music that generic pop sound that it originally seemed to have slowly washed away and that signature fob sound came screaming out to me. And now I have to say I really like alot of the songs! (it feels like a more popish folie a duex) But there are still ones I can never like: my songs know what you did in the dark, the mighty fall, one other I forget, and sadly save rock and roll (Elton John does not at all fit in with fob) so now that those song I grew to like stuck and I accepted the change of fallout boy this became a very good cd. But its no where near the quality of any of there past works
B001UTW7QU|5.0|We were not sure we would like this.  We started and after the second episode, we were hooked.  On season two now.
B000UJCALI|5.0|Directed by Stanley Kubrick and starring Jack Nicholso! What more do you need to know? Buy the movie. You won't be disappointed.
B00CJ32S74|1.0|I've never been a fan of Baz Luhrmann. It's clear from this soundtrack that his audio sensibilities is just as garish as his visual ones. A very COMMERCIAL sounding album - as commercial as a bunch of bizarre rap and indie rock hybrids shoe-horned into a faux 1920s aesthetic could be - that generally don't stand well together as a listening experience. Want to have the few good songs you remember from the movie? I liked the CoCo song and the Florence and the Machine track. Well some idiot has marketed this as ALBUM ONLY. At $16.00 to boot! Often it makes sense for people to buy instrumental soundtrack albums when you have an individual composer and the sonic stamp and consistency of the music makes it an exciting listen. It doesn't usually work that way with various artist soundtracks unless they really freeze dry an aesthetic of the time - let's say Flashdance or Footloose. We've had a few various artists soundtracks that have been really good - the laser focus of Tarantino soundtracks, Coppola's Marie Antionette soundtrack. But I find it unlikely that someone would like more than 5 or 6 songs off this mess of a listen. This is going to mean low sales. Solution: $1.29 per track with 80% of downloads being ALBUM ONLY. What a bunch of crap. And finally, for anyone who was extremely disappointed by the XX's Coexist album and were hoping for them to have another shot here, don't waste your time. They provide another dire, slow, unpassionate song with no drive, melody or soul. It's so early in their career and they already sound stagnant! The XX - new sonic vampires draining the life and color out of EVERYTHING!
B00C6B9976|5.0|The sole reason for me buying this movie is because I am a collector. The product arrived on time and in great condition. I did not open the package... simply added it to my other Steelbox movies. If you are a fellow collector... I would not hesitate to recommend this Steelcase movie for your collection.
0307970299|1.0|I don't know how this could happen, and I can't believe my set is the only one with the problem...but this poor woman is repeating hundreds of miles of horrible, painful hiking.<br /><br />I would appreciate a credit, or whatever you want...I do not want another copy of this Audio CD, listening to it twice, and feeling crazy at the same time has not been fun. I buy Audio books from Amazon very often, and have never had a problem before...I know you don't manufacture or package these things, it is just a fluke.<br /><br />Please let the seller know.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Being a long time Queensryche fan I suffered through the dismal musical production after Promised Land. I had lost hope that Queensryche would ever regain their true sound and passion. That hope began to prosper after hearing the tracks  Redemption and then Fallout.  Those songs brought back the anticipation for new Queeensryche music, something I had not felt for a very  long time.  I listened to the CD from start to finish without interruption and I was thoroughly impressed. It is a stellar effort with some very memorable songs. From the bombastic \\"Where Dreams Go To Die\\" to the beautiful and  moody closer \\"Open Road\\" the CD takes you on a journey of rebirth. Every song paints a picture of a band who is rediscovering themselves and having fun again. Their new found creativity is refreshing and only touches upon the greatness that is yet to come. Longtime fans will not be disappointed.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Anything that looks like it may be linked to Fairy Tales instantly grabs my attention. I spotted this book at Costco, along with Scarlet, and came home and bought the book that night. And read it that night.<br /><br />Cinder is an interesting character and I love her attitude through the book, and her interactions with the adorkable Prince Kai and Iko, her android with a love of shoes. Marissa is great at giving characters sticking personalities, which is definitely one of the strong points for this book. The plot did quickly shift away from the traditional &#34;Cinderella&#34; storyline, but by the time you realize it you don't care any more. A few parts were predictable by the end, but that didn't stop me from buying Scarlet and counting the days until Cress and Snow come out.
1451696191|4.0|I have been going around and around in my head about how to rate this book. \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is a coming-of-age story which deals with many important issues high school students face, including suicide, drugs, homosexuality, friendship, molestation, mental illness, being an outcast, relationship breakups, and first loves. Pretty much everything including the kitchen sink. The narrative comes from \\"Charlie,\\" a high school freshman who documents his whole school year in a series of letters to a person whose name is never revealed.<br /><br />Charlie is very likable. As he struggles to make sense of the hole in his life that the suicide of his friend Michael leaves, he occasionally drops a tasty quote that could come straight from a fortune cookie. These include:<br /><br />\\"I just hope I remember to tell my kids that they are as happy as I look in my old photographs.\\"<br /><br />\\"We accept the love we think we deserve.\\"<br /><br />\\"...things change, and friends leave, and life doesn't stop for anybody.\\"<br /><br />\\"Even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where to go from there.\\"<br /><br />The book has some very powerful moments in it, and I am glad that there is literature like this out there for young adults that addresses many \\"taboo\\" subjects honestly and openly. I think it lies solidly in the upper end of the Young Adult spectrum, which is both good and bad. It is good in that perhaps more high school students will actually read it, but it is bad in that the book can be overly simplistic with its fortune cookie sayings and its tendency to try to address pretty much everything that could possibly happen in one year of high school. J.D. Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" set the standard in these genera, and is more subtle and better written. \\"Wallflower,\\" though, may speak to today's young people in a more immediate way. It will be interesting to follow it through the years and see how well it holds up with each succeeding generation.<br /><br />This book has been controversial, even being involved in a number of book-banning controversies across the nation. I say good. If controversy brings attention to it and thus causes even more young people to read it, all the better.th each succeeding generation.<br /><br />This book has been controversial, even being involved in a number of book-banning controversies across the nation.

B001ANSSDC|3.0|A few interesting twists and turns...a good book for any group discussion.  I hadn't seen the movie, so the story was new for me.  If I were living with someone with similar behavior issues, the book most likely would have been a comfort.
0062255657|5.0|This is an incredible book whether you are a long time fan of Mr. Gaiman's work or this is your first experience with him.  It was haunting, beautiful and perfectly captures the feeling of revisiting your childhood memories and their settings.  It is a fairy tale for adults who miss the world of their childhood where magic could intrude at any point.<br /><br />True, its a short book but it felt like it ended exactly where it needed to.  The fact that you could tell it began in Mr. Gaiman's actual past (sort of, to a point, read it and you will understand) made the story feel stronger and more real in spite of the fantastic nature of the narrative.<br /><br />I feel sorry for those poor folks who gave 2 and 1 star reviews, for I cannot see how they have any joy in their lives.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|I don't know why critics tore this apart, it was your standard period action flick, and it was good.  It wasn't Schindler's List, but it was very enjoyable.
B004OC07N0|4.0|Definitely some valuable tools.  Although it seems aimed at the C suite, there are techniques and tools that can help folks at any level.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The game was fun, especially for my young niece and nephew who loved naming the horse and picking out cheap outfits for it. The interactive games were a little too hard for them to play and actually earn any coins so they mostly stuck to feeding and grooming. It's hard to get gems and I wish they had better ways to earn them considering you need at least 300 gems for anything cool, and I only have like 13. Still a fun game, good graphics. Just needs work.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a really fun app. its extremely addicting. great for long road trips and better than 100 floors. will keep.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|It's been a long time coming. I am very happy to say that, while some components were predictable, I find myself satisfied with the ending. I'm am just so thankful that the series was completed, given the passing of Jordan.
B001NLKWLW|1.0|I am astounded at the high reader ratings for this book and, in the future, will give consideration to the target audience (romance lovers, in this case) before ever trusting another rating.<br /><br />The book's main character shows all the emotional and intellectual depth of a four-year-old, rendering her reactions to the book's central events so ludicrous that they leap from the page shouting,&#34;You must be an idiot if you are buying a word of this story!&#34;<br /><br />Never before have I been incensed enough over  bad writing to write a review, but in this case felt fair warning should be given to serious readers. In retrospect, I should have caught on to what I was in for after just a few pages, but struggled on hopefully for perhaps thirty pages more before giving up entirely. Save your money.
1582701709|1.0|I somehow ended up listening to this on YouTube and was so appalled by what I heard that I immediately felt moved to leave a review on amazon in order to try and warn others away. Now, I like self help books as much as the next person but this really is utter, utter tripe. I was reminded of a character from the film Mystery Men called 'The Sphinx', he would come out with hilariously inane 'wise' phrases such as:<br /><br />\\"Learn to hide your strikes from your opponent and you'll more easily strike his hide\\"<br /><br />\\"He who questions training only trains himself at asking questions\\"<br /><br />\\"When you can balance a tack hammer on your head, you will head off your foes with a balanced attack\\"<br /><br />The 40 minutes I listened to this (in some kind of horror induced, 'cant quite believe what I'm hearing' stupor) was like a non-stop Sphinx monologue...I was left feeling disoriented and car sick.

B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Without a doubt the best album Queensryche has produced since Promised Land. Relieving Geoff Tate of his duty as the front man and replacing him with Todd La Torre was an incredible risk. One that has paid off beautifully. This album was written, produced and performed by all five members of this incredible band. Todd, Scott, Michael, Ed and Parker are force to be reckoned with. The thinking man's metal band is back and better than ever!
B00498YZH8|2.0|this movie consisted of actors standing around square jawed and spitting nails. Lost the depth and personality that the book had. Don't know how they went so wrong

1451695195|5.0|I purchased the book Proof of Heaven, due to his interview on Oprah. It caught my attention, because his experience resembles the same experience that a very famous brazilian medium wrote in 1944, named O nosso lar- \\"Astral City\\". Chico Xavier was an exceptional medium who lived a very humble life, because he spend his entire life helping families connecting with the dead and writing their messages. With the help of this spiritual guide, he wrote the book Astral City , which was also about a skeptical doctor who lived for money and prestige. He died unexpectedly, and found himself in the same grey and foggy place that Dr. Alexander describes in Proof of Heaven.<br /><br />Astral City, gives us so many details about a journey from the lower realms, redemption and God's unconditional love. It's a beautiful story that might change your view about the After Live and what happens to our consciousness. It gives specific details on how souls live on the other realms. This book touches so many controversial subjects, that its best for you to read it for yourself and do your own research. For those who are curious to know what life might be like after death, I would suggest to get into Chico Xavier's book. Please Keep your mind open when reading \\"Astral CIty,\\" it's a lot to take in.<br />Here is a link of a PDF version. Enjoy and God bless us all<br /><br />http://www.geae.inf.br/en/books/ac/AstralCity.PDF

B0050DIWFC|3.0|The father's insistence on his son's innocence seemed unrealistic, he acted in a way that made it seem like he still thought his boy was a little four year old. He used his legal background to make it  OK to interfere with the case, and much of the end was unclear.  Like &#34;Gone Girl,&#34; I was surprised at the popularity of the book -  I didn't enjoy reading this at all.

1490313370|5.0|Just reading the first page intrigued me and I could not stop turning the pages.  James does both a vivid and exceptional explanation on realizing that dreams are out there but there's bold moves and exercises one must take!  The hint of humor in the book definitely is what keeps it entertaining! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enacts on good advice and those who could use a little &#34;push&#34; to keep going for whatever it is they want to achieve!  5/5.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoy the game. It is creative and challenging without being overwhelming. However, I HATE the constantly flashing advertisement at the bottom of the screen. It is very distracting and such an annoyance that I play for a much shorter period of time then I normally would.

B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|It is a fun game. No pressure or time limits.  Just an easy going  game to pass the time. Pretty colors, fun storyline.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Decent and challenging game of levels. Would like more levels to play and explore.  Hoping there are more soon. A fun quick game.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It's a fun yet challenging physic based game. I played it on ios and it was fun. Im just happy to have it for my kindle FIRE hd.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Seriosuly, why is this the top paid app? There is honestly nothing to do in the game what so ever. Is this game some kind of joke?
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the whole season. I watched this as a child, and I have fond memories. The quality is great, the summary of each episode is accurate. I have my daughter watching with me now. Enhances the membership.
B000YIGNKE|3.0|Before watching this movie, I had previously read the book and watched the 1995 version. So I'll compare both to this.<br /><br />I liked Anne better in this than the 1995, but not by much; Sally Hawkins is perhaps a little nicer to look at, and doesn't bug her eyes as much as Amanda Root, but still is a little too flustered all the time.<br /><br />Neither films' Capt. Wentworth were really great, neither seemed to quite fit the character.<br /><br />No one can beat Sophie Thompson's Mary, you can't even compare the two performances.<br /><br />Anne's elder sister Elizabeth is supposed to be beautiful; she's not in this film. 1995's Elizabeth is somewhat better.<br /><br />Charles Musgrove, Sir Elliot, and Mr. Elliot are adequate, though I prefer Charles in the 1995 better.<br /><br />The set and costumes are fresher in this adaptation, though occasionally Anne's dress's are a little too shabby. One the whole, both sets and costumes are better in this version.<br /><br />The music is beautiful, and goes well with the film's overall tone. Martin Phipps did a wonderful job.<br /><br />It's impossible to review an adaptation of a book without commenting on the faithfulness to the novel; that said, I must have a word about the four major scenes that strayed.  First, Anne's conversation with Capt. Harville on the faithfulness of men and women which originally is at the close of the novel and prompts Capt. Wentworth to write his letter to Anne; in the movie, it is moved to earlier in the film, and is between Anne and Capt. Benwick.  They would have done better to leave the sequence alone, as their meddling with it did not improve the story.  The second and worse stray is when Anne, after receiving Wentworth's letter, finds it necessary to run like a flustered hen about Bath in search of the author.  That scene is a negative on two accounts: first, it is NOT in the book. Second, it is highly unlikely that a woman of high status and in that era would ever do anything so undignified. The third and fourth unlikely scenes are 1) Anne and Capt. Wentworth's kiss, which was in my opinion gross, and a thing that they would NOT have done in the middle of a busy street, and 2) Capt. Wentworth's buying Kellynch Hall; also unlikely, and also not in the book.<br /><br />To  close, this movie may be more appealing, have an attractive cast, and a good pace, but if you want faithfulness to the book, go for the 1995 version. Though slow, and not attractive to all, it is very faithful to the book, and will appeal to Austen/Persuasion purists more than this.
B0012QVJXS|3.0|This is a lightweight movie-kind of lame and corny at times. Special effects were ok for the 70's. Acting is a little lame.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This game is a wonderful way to create your own jurassic park like in the movies! You must budget money, feed dinosaurs, and accept missions from characters in the films. And later in the game you are able to activate code red mode an  keep to sinks under control. The in game purchase rates are fairly decent, and they are not necessary to get to progress. The only main problem is that about half the time when you start it up, something goes wrong and it doesn't load. Just go into applications and force stop it, and it should work. Despite the numerous crashes like this, it is worth it and fun for all ages

B008JFUOWM|5.0|I have seen this movie twice. I think this s the best one is the best of all of the end. Non stop action and racing. This move was a 2hour movie and sure did not seen like it. My family and I were all on the edge of our seats and laughed a few times. The ending has a huge twice we all did not see coming. I can't wait for part 7. A must see movie!,,,,
B00B2TUKI0|4.0|This is not my usual style of music, but am really enjoying this mix of lyrics and music.<br />Personally i had never heard of this artist and only bought the cd because i saw the making of it on a tv program.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome addictive game ! Had it for ages and haven't stopped playing yet.The graphics are great and the tour is a great idea
B007ZYJT1U|4.0|This is an excellent British drama about very difficult and dreary situations. I would have given it 5 stars except for the somewhat depressing nature of the story. However, it is not a complete downer. It is a stark portrait of people on the rump side of life who are struggling towards human contact and hope.
030758836X|3.0|convoluted, which is a good thing, I suppose, but I felt the characters were not believable, good for summer reading
B00CM9JKXU|5.0|I can't review this album without at least acknowledging the circumstances surrounding it. This is the first Queensryche album without iconic vocalist Geoff Tate and the first to feature new vocalist Todd La Torre (former drummer and Crimson Glory singer) and guitarist Parker Lundgren, along with original members Scott Rockenfield, Michael Wilton and Eddie Jackson. It's being released in the midst of a legal battle over the Queensryche name/brand, and it follows a recent album release from the `other' version of Queensryche, of which the only original member is Geoff Tate who worked with other musicians and some long-time collaborators.  To say this has created some turmoil and discussion in the Queensryche fan base would be a major understatement.<br /><br />The consensus of most Queensryche fans is that band's musical output and direction started deteriorating sometime after Empire or Promised Land and it has since been a string of mediocre to disappointing albums ever since with Dedicated to Chaos being a low point.  That streak ends TODAY.<br /><br />In a stunning and rare musical comeback, Queensryche arises from a musical coma to deliver a brilliant album can stand proudly against their finest classic releases, such as Rage For Order, Mindcrime and Empire.  THIS is the classic and signature Queensryche sound that we haven't heard for 20 years. The twin aggressive guitars leads, the growling bass, the soaring vocals, the melodic hooks, the metal and progressive elements, excellent songwriting, jaw-dropping drumming, amazing production (Producer Jimbo Barton is back!)...it's all back and it just sounds so right. The band hasn't sounded this alive and passionate in a LONG time.<br /><br />The album somehow manages to do the impossible by recapturing the `magic' and essence of the signature Queensryche sound, but without sounding dated and bringing in new more modern elements.  It sounds very familiar, yet entirely new.  This is the album they should have made after Promised Land and simply surpasses all expectations.<br /><br />They are writing and performing as a band again, and it shows. Michael, cott and Eddie are unleashed on this album, almost as if they are letting out years of pent-up musical frustration.  Guitarist Parker Lundgren cements his legacy in QR with his contributions to this album by writing \\"Where Dreams Go to Die\\", the leadoff track.<br /><br />What about new vocalist Todd La Torre, you ask? If you have seen Todd perform live or heard any of the clips of this album, I don't need to tell you.  He is AMAZING.  It is impossible to overstate his outstanding vocal performances and musical/lyrical contributions on this album, and to the band as a whole.  His overall vocal style is close enough to classic Geoff Tate that it still sounds like Queensryche, but he injects so much of his own unique style and influences that he still manages to have his own identify and put his own stamp on it.  It is even more incredible when you realize this is his debut album as a singer.<br /><br />The only negatives are that it is a very short album in this era (35 minutes), some of the songs could have been extended/explored more (3-4 minute songs only) and it is mastered very `hot'.  Had the album had a few more songs (with one or two longer tracks) and had it not been mastered so hot/loud, this would be a masterpiece in my book. It comes awfully close as it is. I almost gave it a 4 star review, but given where they came from, the situation, and what they achieved overall...I had to give it a 5.<br /><br />I will leave it to others to provide a track-by-track commentary and do an in-depth review, but suffice it say that it is a FANTASTIC album and if you have ever been a fan of Queensryche (and especially for those who started to drop out when Hear in the New Frontier came out) or this type of music, this is a MUST BUY.  I recommend getting the Deluxe Edition with the three extra live tracks. It has something for all QR fansto love and although you will certainly enjoy some songs more than others, there is no filler and every song is strong in its own right. If this is their debut album with this lineup, I have even higher hopes for the next album.<br /><br />Queensryche is BACK and the future looks bright.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So much fun. What a brain teaser. It was a challenge but once you figure it out, it was fun going to each room. Wish there were more rooms
0788859544|4.0|Only complaint was the packing as the case was cracked. No big deal I guess. This movie has everything, great sound track and endearing characters

B004ZNARH4|5.0|This was an awesome box set. Made a great gift. My Husband really really likes this box set. Great Buy!
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is one of a very few male POV erotic novels I've read and I loved it.  The writing is sharp and very funny.  This is erotic romance so we all know where the story is going but I loved reading a different take on it.  There were several times I almost spit my drink onto my Kindle because I was laughing so hard.  As I read the beginning of the book I thought that Emma Chase must be a guy.<br /><br />I loved Drew's internal dialog.  I picked up this book because I wanted to read about the things that might be going on in a guys mind.  I love the one off stories he tells.  The book reads like Drew is talking to woman who is a friend of his.  Although it is a bit of stretch to believe that Drew would have any friends who are women, I liked the tone.<br /><br />Drew is a player and doesn't apologize for it.  I loved that he's not some sort of damaged man trying to sort out a horrible childhood.  He's just a guy; crude, sarcastic and adorable.  I think that makes the love story better.  This is a guy who has lots of experience and is completely floored when he unexpectedly meets his match.  Kate is a woman who sees through his BS and calls him on it.  She is no pushover and doesn't immediately fall into bed with Drew.<br /><br />There is a scene in the book when Drew and Kate are having sex and she is screaming \\"Oh God\\".  Drew's response is priceless!  That is, by far, my favorite exchange in the book and a piece of advice I've taken to heart.  This is a book that is definitely on my re-read list.
B00D37UQ1K|4.0|In short, I thought the movie was done well, considering the challenge of informing the viewers about \\"souls.\\" I never expect a movie to be exactly like the book but I was pleasantly surprised by this production and how well it followed the books' timeline. I recommend it to those who have and haven't read the book, but if you haven't I recommend reading it just to gain the full emotions and back story that movies lack.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|Atonement was 100x better. The big scandal was a dud and no one seemed real. Probably won't buy another Mcewan book.

0811874192|5.0|A great gift instead of flowers. Lasts longer than flowers. Potentially lasts for generations. Makes a startlingly favorable impression on recipient. Colorful, genuine 3D, pop-up motion a real eye-catcher. Built so that each flower arrangement can be shown separately and consecutively.
B00CU8OVIM|4.0|This album is a step up from his debut album, which had a change in his delivery and style that I felt wasn't perfected yet. I have been a fan since his mixtapes from The Come Up - The Warm Up - Friday Night Lights, and I was much more accepting of this album than Cole World: The Sideline Story which was a rougher product than this album Born Sinner.<br /><br />My favorite songs from this album were: Villuminati, Forbidden Fruit, Ain't That Some S***(Interlude), Crooked Smile, and Is She Gon Pop. Also to me the two songs on this album I really don't like are Trouble and Runaway.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good album filled with good lyrics and great production that is very much a Rap/Hip-Hop album then you should buy this album. There are too many Rap albums out there sounding too much like an electro-rock-rap accident/mistake.<br /><br />The reason I have stuck with J. Cole is because when he puts out an album or mixtape he doesn't overstuff it with featured artist after featured artist, when you listen to his album you get to hear him and not his friends who also rap. On this album there is one song that has another artist rapping a verse called \\"New York Times\\" feat. Bas. The featured artists that do appear on the album are doing the hooks and choruses. This is not a Young Money or Maybach Music production featuring the whole label roster.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game! It's like a vortex and sucks you in!! I just can not put this game down! Highly recommended!
B006DRVFRQ|4.0|gReader is my favorite RSS app. Fast, easy to use and has an eye-pleasing UI.  Of course, the version offered here isn't the newest one - the one that syncs to Feedly instead of Google Reader.  The review goes up to five stars once we can get that version.
B004UHL9EK|3.0|It's useful and there if you need or want it.  Easy to use. Simple layout. Not a replacement for a good quality and portable stop watch, but has its uses, and I've used it numerous times.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|There are truly not enough positive things I can say about Hanson's incredible 6th studio album. From the adrenaline-fueled opening riffs of Fired Up through the lovely melodic piano of \\"Save Me From Myself\\", ANTHEM delivers time and time again with each track. There is honestly not a single song I dislike or would consider skipping over. With songs that inspire and simultaneously make you want to dance, whether played in order or shuffled, it's a downright enjoyable experience from start to finish. I think it's obvious that this album is a true labor of love from the band, and it shows that they are capable of evolving and growing while staying true to the roots and principles that have kept them going strong for 21 years. I have never been prouder of these three amazingly talented guys. If you haven't listened to Hanson before, NOW is the time to give them a listen. You won't be disappointed.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love Vince Flynn and am broken hearted to hear of his passing. He leaves a legacy of the vast dishonesty of both American politicians and their foreign counterparts.

B005N95JA4|5.0|A year after the Rolling Stones re-released the 18 songs of Exile on Main St with 10 excavated tracks, mostly from the original sessions, they've come out with the same treatment for the 10 songs of 1978's Some Girls, adding 12 songs from those sessions. The Some Girls sessions were the first with Ron Wood, and produced about 50 songs (including a prototype for \\"Start Me Up\\"), many of which appeared on Emotional Rescue and Tattoo You, and 22 of those 50 appear here. But this is not the second time the Stones have given fans back some of their discarded tracks - Tattoo You, released in 1981, was made up of songs that dated from multiple sessions from 1972 (when Mick Taylor was still in the band) to 1980, including also the 1978 Some Girls sessions.<br /><br />The album, of course, starts off with the magnificent harmonica- and saxophone-enhanced disco funk of \\"Miss You\\", a wild and wacky if there ever was one. \\"When the Whip Comes Down\\" is punky and hard (and punky and gay in its themes, of course), while \\"Imagination\\" is a spacey, swirley cover of \\"Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)\\", a sweet over-wrought 1971 song by the Temptations, with its orchestration, maracas and divine harmonisation. Here, however, it works well as a rock `n' roll with the standard Mick verses, Mick `n' Keith chorus. \\"Some Girls\\" is a weird song that sort of drones on and on, reveling in digging up misogynistic controversy (such as the notorious \\"black girls just wanna...\\" line), but it's not really a hot Stones number and I wonder if they ever played it live. The solos are pretty okay, though, really weird guitar hacking. \\"Lies\\" is a sweet, fast rocker that stampedes all over the place. \\"Far Away Eyes\\" is, along with \\"Some Girls\\", the second novelty song on this song, where Mick narrates the story of a Southern hick who drives around, meets a girl with faraway eyes... yeah. The music is pure country, and it's hard to believe that this is the Rolling Stones, but I guess it is! \\"I had an arrangement to meet a girl, and I was kinda late, and I thought that by the time I'd get there she'd be off with the first truck driver she could find. Much to my surprise, there she was sitting in the corner, a little bleary, worse for wear and tear... the girl... with FAAAAAAAR away eyes.\\" Guilty pleasure time, I like this song more than I probably should (the same can be said of the other country songs that the band does among the bonus tracks, a Waylan Jennings song and a Hank Williams number - shame SHAME!). \\"Respectable\\" has Mick joining Keith and Ron on guitar, it's a heavy rocker and good fun, even if the chorus is pretty boring. Oh well. \\"Before They Make Me\\" is a Keith Richards song that... isn't as good as \\"Happy.\\" \\"Beast Of Burden\\" is the classic swamp monster that strokes and rolls with that weird Stones vibe. Great stuff. The album is topped off with the manic weirdness of \\"Shattered\\", with Mick really going nuts, the perfect bookend to the similar \\"Miss You\\", although \\"Shattered\\" lack's the former's disco beat - instead it has a killer googly riff.<br /><br />The bonus tracks start off with \\"Claudine\\", a weird country honkey tonk about Claudine Longet, who sang \\"L'amour est Bleu (Love is Blue)\\" and who shot her boyfriend, Olympic skier Spider Sabich, in Aspen, Colorado, whether intentionally or accidentally. The lyrics to this rockin' murder ballad are pretty rough, the song had originally been intended for \\"Emotional Rescue\\", but it was pulled. \\"So Young\\" is just as raunchy, with lyrics like \\"put my dick on a leash\\", it's a wicked honkey tonk with some great piano from Ian Stewart, who was largely absent from these session, and there's some cool scratchy guitar. \\"Do You Think I Really Care\\" is a silly country song that has some pretty funny lyrics (\\"I see you in the back of Max's Kansas City, propping up the bar\\"), while \\"When You're Gone\\" is a swampy blues rocker with nasty distorted vocals, kind of CCR-ish. \\"No Spare Parts\\" seems to be one of the new songs on the release, with Don Was playing bass rather than Bill Wyman. It's another plaintive country rocker (how many of them did the Stones record in these sessions?). \\"Don't Be A Stranger\\" also has a new feel to it, and sounds a fair amount like \\"Dancing In The Light\\" from the Exile on Main St bonus songs sessions. This song, however, has a sort of Latin feel to it, and it zooms around with Mick addressing a former love. \\"You can tell me of your escapades, the story of your lost decade, don't be a stranger, a stranger no more, don't be a stranger, just knock on my door.\\" \\"We Had It All\\" is a real Waylon Jennings country mourner, sung by Keith, it's a sad and haunting tune that really sticks with you, minimal arrangements. Great. \\"Tallahassee Lassie\\", an old Freddy Cannon rockabilly number. \\"I Love You Too Much\\" is a typical Stones rocker, nothing exciting. \\"Keep Up Blues\\" has a new-ish sound to it, kind of like the mock blues of \\"I'm Not Signifying\\" on the Exile on Main St bonus tracks. \\"You Win Again\\" is a Hank Williams song, so it's quite countrified, plodding along, chewin' cud, moaning and groaning, \\"this heart of mine has never SEEEEEEEEENNNN\\". \\"Petrol Blues\\" is a bizarre piano stomp that Mick plays and sings on, \\"Dear Mr President...\\"<br /><br />The packaging for the re-release is nothing special - it's in a cardboard double CD case and there's nice album art, but the booklet has not much other than a three page essay on the release and a bunch of images of the Stones, lingerie models and famous movie stars, all cropped from the original cover art. At least there's five pages of black and white pics of the area. There are also credits, so you get to see how many tracks have people form the original sessions and how many modern additions like Don Was sat in on.he new songs on the release, with Don Was playing bass rather than Bill Wyman.

B005LAIH2M|5.0|This is currently my favorite movie ever!!! I loved it, everything about this movie was amazing! I can't understand how this movie ever got bad reviews! The storyline, the witches makeup, the acting and blood and gore is truly amazing! I read a sequel is in the works and I can't wait! This movie is worth buying! I loved it and everyone who I reccomended it to loved it as well especially me being a horror movie lover. I love blood and guts and witchcraft and everything related to this genre. Amazing movie! So glad I bought this. Wish I saw it in theathers!
B000000WJ2|3.0|Keith's second album is a lot different from his first, mainly because it is far less experimental and jammy, and has stronger songs, two of which you can keep humming for days. The first song \\"999″ is probably the album's best rocker, with an intriguing bass-y riff in that inimitable Keith Richards guitar voice. Wonderful. \\"Wicked As It Seems\\" is a pretty standard rocker with just a bit of blues in it (with plenty of that band-background-vocals\\" that you never get on a Stones album, but seems to permeate this Keith's solo work). Third song \\"Eileen\\" is a beautiful pop ballad, I love it - really a remarkably soulful little tune. \\"World Of Wonder\\" is the first non-standard song on the set, a reggae workout with Keith's rasp holding it all together. \\"Yap Yap\\" is a silly jam-out song. Kinda like it, not sure why. \\"Yap Yap, you talk too much.\\" \\"Bodytalk\\" is more of a Stones-y jam that rambles on and on, with nice guitar licks, and whispers of female vocals from Sarah Dash. \\"Hate It When You Leave\\" is the other really great song on the album, starting off with mellow guitar before soaring into near-Arabic woodwinds. Beautiful production on this, one of Keith's all-time best songs. Love the chorus! \\"Runnin' Too Deep\\" rocks well, and \\"Will But You Won't\\" is more of the same. \\"Demon\\" is slow and misty, a cool little tune.<br /><br />Bottom line is that - just like with Talk Is Cheap - none of these songs are anywhere as good as the solo songs that Keith sings on the Stones albums (except maybe \\"Eileen\\" and \\"Hate It When You Leave\\"), even the ones from the 1990s or the first decade of the new century. But this album is definitely a lot more fun than its predecessor, leaving no reason to not believe that a third solo Keith Richards album would have simply destroyed!!!!!!
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Suspenseful; surprising; even inspiring. This is an underrated film. Its an an anthology with seperate but surpisingly<br />interwoven tales. Well acted, well filmed and directed. A very good film. I can see it developoing a cult following over time.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|A lot of fun but sometimes I find myself trying to find new ways to crash rather than actually trying to reach objectives
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|It's so funny and relaxing. It's the best medicine if you happen to be in bad mood.  I recommend it to anyone....enjoy
B00008EQ20|3.0|Keith's two solo albums get a lot of praise in general, being considered generally much better than Mick's; no one, however, mentions Ron Wood's numerous solo albums, which are definitely the best of the three (four, if you count Mick Taylor's dull offering). Keith tends to get funky and experimental, to Wood's solid rock writing, and on Keith's first outing you get a bit of a jam feel with all sorts of unconventional song structures. There's weird bass sounds on the opening track \\"Big Enough\\", the weird string mutations of \\"Struggle\\", a relatively straight forward rocker, and then the odd '50s doo-wopabilly of \\"I Could Have Stood You Up\\" (the Stones never farmed this sort of Stray Cats territory). \\"You Don't Move Me\\", an ode to Mick Jagger, is a decent rocker, but it suffers from an overdose of backup vocals in the chorus, and a generally loose song structure. \\"How I Wish\\" is a nice song, while \\"Rockawhile\\" is more jam-y (the keyboards are horrible, though, although the accompanying vocals are soulful). \\"Whip It Up\\" is a solid rocker, while \\"Locked Away\\" is a mellow song that again suffers from too much background vocals. Closing track \\"It Means A Lot\\" is jam-y and meandering. Not bad.<br /><br />The album contains the single \\"Take It So Hard\\", which is a meaty rocker with a nice rousing chorus, while the best song on the album is \\"Make No Mistake\\", a moody little duet Sarah Dash. Also featured on the album singing backups is Mrs Springsteen herself, Patty Scialfa. This came out in 1988, between Stones albums Dirty Work (1986) and Steel Wheels (1989), when Mick and Keith were at their most pissed off with each other (mainly about Mick's solo albums, which came out in 1985 and 1987).<br /><br />Bottom line is that none of these songs are anywhere as good as the solo songs that Keith sings on the Stones albums, even the ones from the 1990s or the first decade of the new century.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun with a bit of a challenge but not to difficult to figure out. I enjoyed the satisfaction of finishing each room. I wish there were more to keep going.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I enjoy playing this  game. Challenging, but not too much that it is frustrating. If not happy with my score, I can re do the challenge..
0679805273|5.0|It was a graduation gift for a high school senior.  It has a fun way of looking at the future for young adults and gives them things to think about.
B009186E3O|5.0|The latest to be released (as of November 2012), but chronologically the first Rolling Stones movie in order of sequence made. Charlie Is My Darling was shot on the Rolling Stones November 1965 \\"tour\\" of Ireland, which means two nights there - November 4th and 5th. The box set contains two original edits of the film (the director's cut of 35 minutes, and the producer's cut of nearly 49 minutes), as well as the new version with restored footage, which is 62:21. The box set folds out nicely, with surprises all along the way - there's an enlarged and numbered cell frame (mine has one of Mick from the interview sessions). There's a nice hardcover booklet, and then there's a cool poster. The pack comes with a DVD of all visual materials (and a Blu-Ray disc of the same material if you have a Blu-Ray player), a CD of the soundtrack of the album (not every scrap of music in the movie, as the jam sessions on Beatles and Elvis songs are omitted), and a bonus CD of 11 songs from the March UK tour (the same one that produced the \\"Got Live If You Want It\\" EP that was released in June 1965).<br /><br />The full movie is great, even if the restored film is quite inky-looking (you see a before-and-after of the restoration - I'd say that, with the exception of the blobs and lines, the original looked better). Starting off the first thing we see is the strange ABKCO logo, and then introductions to the band members that includes Andrew Loog Oldham (who is rarely present in pictures of the Stones from those days, as if the band wants to minimalise his importance). Oldham, clearly, had a hand in the production of this - he isn't listed alongside the Stones in the producer's cut or the director's cut. The film opens with the wacky orchestral \\"Play With Fire\\" from the Andrew Oldham Orchestra (other orchestral versions play throughout the film from time to time - none of them are any good, except for the awesome \\"Satisfaction\\", which is spruced up with some pretty funky fuzz bass). There's some sweet fan talk, \\"I like the one who plays the drums.\\" Bizarre, haughty answers to the question of \\"why do you like the Stone that you like?\\" Answer: I don't have a reason, I just like him. I just like him. I just like him. One person goes so far as to say \\"I like his hair.\\" Great prophetic quotes from Brian Jones, \\"My futures as a Rolling Stone is uncertain.\\" He's generally very negative, talking about marriage in a doubtful way with that soft voice of his (of course he couldn't get married - he beat and cheated on his women after getting them pregnant). But he's more upbeat about the film he wants to make, which is about love, and in which Love is one of the (abstracted) characters (Bergmanesque?). Interview clips from Mick, Charlie, rian, Bill and Keith. Mick's quotes are the best: \\"You have to be very egotistical (onstage). It's an act, it's not really you.\\"<br /><br />The progression of the film seems to be chronological - leaving London for Ireland, hanging out before the first show, the first show, then some more hanging around, then the second show, some more hanging around, then scenes of the journey home (to the strains of \\"Going Home\\"), and then the arrival back in London. Scenes from the road, driving down a wet motorway, in the airport at customs. What appears to be an undercover cop strolls by the camera, a deer caught in the headlights. Smallish crowd around the venue. The director interviews an Irish bloke with long hair who says he's in a band called The Creatures - Van Morisson? Brian Jones practicing on his Firebird. \\"We want BILL!!!\\" The first set is electric, and we see the band jumping around, the camera swaying and not really catching things well. The band sings into strange little tulip mics, and when Mick detaches his there's a whole long piece he has to take off. A riot breaks out onstage after \\"It's Alright.\\" Charlie gets tugged-upon, Brian spins around, people stay away from a ferocious Keith, but they have to call it a show eventually. The band practices \\"Sitting On A Fence\\" backstage. Keith so young, pre-junkie days, wearing a cop's hat. \\"Tell Me\\" solo practice. The band breaks into a groan-a-thon of the Beatles' \\"I've Just Seen A Face\\", then \\"Eight Days A Week.\\" Nice shot of Andrew Loog Oldham picking his nose. In the train smoking just next to a No Smoking sticker. Brian Jones complaining that fame means \\"no physical freedom.\\" Nice shots of old cars, the boys harassing/following school kids like a bunch of perverts. A prophetic/obvious Mick: \\"The kids of 21 now have to become 75 before the whole thing is changed.\\" Well, the kids of 21 in 1965 are now 68 (and Mick is 69), and how much has changed? A lot, but we're still much more conservative than we should be by the indications of the change that was beginning to show itself that year. Brian Jones relates the story of the Long Beach mob when they were nearly crushed inside of a car by the surrounding fans. \\"Most successful entertainers have always been the most egotistical ones onstage. They might not be as egotistical as that offstage. But all that ego is got rid of onstage. (I'm) about half as egotistical (offstage as on).\\" Brian picks nose. Charlie sings!! Keith looks like Lou Reed. Great finger picking guitar. There seems to be an aborted plug for Lipton's Tea, which the boys promote but in such a sarcastic way that it really takes the piss.<br /><br />At the concert on the second day, we see the band from behind the curtains just as they open and the show begins - exciting fly-on-the-wall feeling. Mick really spazzes out during \\"Reeling And Rocking\\". A priest shows up at the concert and he's interviewed (now living in Cambodia, there's an interview with him in the booklet where he describes the ruckus that erupted in the Church after this scandalous incident - happily, the bishop supported him, knocking down all the haters). \\"I feel like Robert Browning. Actually, I was thinking of Shelley,\\" sys Mick, wankily. Keith on piano, singing like Elvis, as camera zooms in and out. Four hands on piano. Great camera work with glowing lamp in hotel room (it's crap throughout most of the film). Bored, bored, bored Stones before a show. Brian Jones: \\"Yes, I've never thought very far ahead at all. I've always ben a little apprehensive about the future.\\" Great pics of the sleeping Stones at the back of the airplane - Brian, Charlie and Bill in the second-last row, Andrew Loog Oldman, Mick and Keith in the very back row.<br /><br />The bonus features are decent, giving the 12 minutes of the raw interview footage of the individual Stones (Mick 2 minutes, Charlie 5 minutes, Brian 4 minutes, Bill 1 minute). Charlie's interviewer follows wonky line of questioning. Bill: \\"I'm not a musician, I just play in a band.\\"<br /><br />The CDs are good. The soundtrack contains a blend of orchestral Stones (so-so), live songs, and interview segments. It makes a great listen on the commute. The live CD from March is even better, as it's a full concert from 1965 (the Got Live If You Want It EP may be from the same month but, with its six songs, it's much less than a concert - if you can even find it!), and it shows a proper setlist of the band before they had any hits, when they were still primarily playing others' songs (eight of the 10 songs they play are covers). The setlist is:<br /><br />1. Everybody Needs Someone To Love (Solomon Burke)<br />2. Pain In My Heart (Allan Toussaint)<br />3. Down The Road Apiece (Don Raye)<br />4. Time Is On My Side (Jerry Ragovoy)<br />5. I'm Alright (The Rolling Stones)<br />6. Off The Hook (Mick Jagger/Keith Richards)<br />7. Little Red Rooster (Willie Dixon)<br />8. Route 66 (Bobby Troup)<br />9. I'm Moving On (Hank Snow)<br />10. The Last Time (Mick Jagger/Keith Richards)<br />11. Everybody Needs Somebody To Love (Solomon Burke)<br /><br />Interestingly, they start the set off with \\"Everybody Needs Somebody To Love\\", but they only play the first verse, before jumping into Pain In My Heart (it's reprised at the end in full). Nice effect. The band is full of energy, and the crowd screaming is not too distracting - each instrument is to be heard very nicely balanced in the mix. Perfect. Mick's voice is young, pure and strong, he never roars or blasts out his voice, nor does he add peculiar flairs. They sound like the Stones, but they are not really yet sleazy and shamboling (no hints of \\"Midnight Rambler\\" here yet), just gritty and raw.<br /><br />The soundtrack CD has some interesting moments. Probably the highlight is the sound of the band being interrupted by the band storming the stage during \\"It's Alright.\\" There is also Oldham's \\"Theme For A Rolling Stone\\", which is a nice little show tune instrumental.<br /><br />Interestingly, this is coming out in the year of the Stones' 50th anniversary celebrations, when they have their new compilation album GRRR! and other projects; but this is an ABKCO production, and as such doesn't really have anything to do with the Stones but Alan Klein's estate, so the Stones aren't promoting it at all.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|We mostly don't understand what it is like to not have parents that want you.  I have always thought of it in terms of loss but the loss is multi-faceted and this book does a wonderfully sensitive job of exposing the emotional raw side of being a foster child.  Using flowers to communicate emotion makes it a must read since flowers do speak to the heart.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Love the game itself. Did a recent update and now I am locked out of the game. Had to delete and reinstall losing everything. I have been waiting over a week for support to respond. Had to start game over from scratch.  VERY glad I have No actual money spent.  Got locked out again but was able to get back in after waiting a few hours.  Very disappointed because you want to trust the Disney name.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I find that I enjoy watching most of USA network's shows. I won't say that the writing for Suits is as good as shows like Breaking Bad or Boston Legal, but it's still witty and has a reasonable amount of story progression on top of the usual procedural format. I found the show addictive enough I managed to watch through all of season 1 it in two days.
B009DQQF7Y|5.0|After so many years without new music you always worry... Nothing to worry about here! It's another Great from Godspeed. The songs just keep on giving. Never know where you are going to go but you know the trip will be great!<br />Cheers to another Classic!!!<br /><br />Papa
B0043C29GE|2.0|This CD skipped on one of the disks the first time I played it. The bad part is, it skips on the one song I ordered it for.  Other then it skipping on my favorite song the CD is good.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|Normally I can't read a book after seeing the movie, let alone twice.  However, an avid book reading friend told me that he'd read the book years and years ago and still he considers it one of the best he's read.  So I thought I'd give it a go.  My preferred genre is non-fiction, but the descriptive nature of Life of Pi and the thought provoking passages are second to none and I'm only half way through and loving it!  I just can't stop reading it; except when I'm lost in thought musing over some engaging part.<br /><br />Seen the movie?  Now read the book!  There's soooo much more.
B005DB7NHO|5.0|This is read and re read and read many times by the kids. I wish i set them up a kindle account so they could re read it all the time when I'm not on my kindle. Recommended to all 1D fans.
B004RZGUBM|4.0|This is an amazing collection. However, it is not very navigable. You cannot navigate easily within chapters, and the table of contents only lists chapters by number, not name.  There were a lot of typos throughout, both words and punctuation! I kept wanting to copy edit this thing.  No complaints about Dickens, however :)
B004QL7K70|3.0|It's kind of like `Superbad' meets `Cloverfield', this high octane teen party film is laced with redundancy and offers up a moral that feels extremely falsified and yet it is extremely entertaining, which is all it ever really tries to be.  With the clich&eacute;d shaky cam in toe and a slew of wannabe actors who have no qualms with taking off their tops and romping around with booze in hand, `Project X' promises the audience a sweaty good time, and for all intents and purposes, that is what we get.  Sadly, there is a lot of redundancy to be found here.  The party scenes (or scene since it lasts the entirety of the movie) has a lot of similar shots, and while havoc ensues to varying degrees, and the end is just a mind blow of crazy, I found myself wanting to hit fast-forward through many parts of the movie.<br /><br />The film circles around a birthday party for Thomas (who is turning 17) at his home by him and his buddies while Thomas's parents are out of town.  The party is an attempt by Thomas's friend Costa to be popular.  Things get way out of hand, Thomas's parents' house gets destroyed, the neighbors call the cops, a midget punches a bunch of people in the nether regions and some crazed lunatic burn's Thomas's house down.  In the meantime, a lot of booze is drunk, loud rap music pumps through your home stereo system and tops galore are tossed to the wayside.<br /><br />The cast is a whos who of nobody you've ever heard of before (aside from Miles Teller who is here briefly), but it doesn't matter.  They don't have to do anything of substance.  They just drink and dance and cheer.  The end result is a bit of a mess.  I like how the film practically turns itself into a horror movie but the idea projected that this party was a GOOD idea in the long run is a shame and kind of proves that mindless entertainment like this really has no reason to be made.<br /><br />That said, I semi-enjoyed myself.
B000TERK14|5.0|This song is exceptional. I enjoy the haunting melody and Leto's voice as usual. This song is a great tribute to leto's introspective abilities.
0307744434|4.0|Gosh, I thoroughly enjoyed this book! I was full of awe and wonder and made me wish I was part of the circus. Love is on every page, at every turn. I began reading this book ready to be thrown into a world were anything is possible, descriptions galore, and I was ready to be enchanted. The Night Circus did just that for me. :)<br /><br />Celia and Marco were chosen, bound together, and set to compete against each other from a young age by two selfish magicians wanting to test who was the better teacher between them. As Celia and Marco grow older, they find themselves at Le Cirque des Reves, it becomes their stage, where they can perform this \\"dual\\" of magic. This dual is not a Harry Potter type of dual we all automatically think of...it is one of back and fourth competition of skills of creation. It is thought these creations that Celia and Marco fall in love with teach other and their magic.<br />The Night Circus is full of magic, wonder, and love. With two alternating time lines that collide at the end of the novel, you discover that it is not jut about a circus but about putting passion into what you create, the immense amount of love for one another, and the possibility of changing your fate. The night Circus has the feel of a bedtime story, mystical and enchanting, that makes you wonder if there really is magic out there.<br /><br />\\"I chose him to contrast her, and to complement. Perhaps I chose too well.\\"-P.379 (isn't that what love is?....)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great series, but so GORY!! Also, by the end, everyoneis dead! To the author: Yu've got to keep enough people alive to keep the reader motivated!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Definitely one of the top apps available for sleep assistance. I'm a light sleeper and need white noise to fall asleep. This app does that and more. Along with white noise, you can also choose from more relaxing noises such as rain or birds chirping.<br /><br />One of my most essential apps.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|This is the first soundtrack I've bought in over 10 years.  I can't recall a film I've watched where the music was so tightly bound to the scope/feeling of the movie as this score.  I've really enjoyed Zimmer's music for quite a while, but the music in Man of Steel was something I felt immediately compelled to run out and buy the day after I saw the movie.  I love the emotional weight Zimmer gives the scenes.  Like this version of Superman/Kal-El, the music reflects a more realistic grit, the struggle inside the man/god.  This music can be epic and powerful, but in other sections it's soft and tender.  I love how I can put this soundtrack on in my car and relive the film any time I want.  I knew 20 seconds into the movie that the music was going to be amazing and I'm so glad it is.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The impression I get after reading this book is that either Sylvia Day doesn't trust her writing to be entertaining enough to sell a fourth book, or she's just plain greedy.  Either way, I will never buy another book written by Sylvia Day again.  She simply stops the story, mid-stream and adds a snarky little comment that says, \\"Yes, dear reader, you're right.  This can't possibly be the end.\\"  Well then, Sylvia, why the heck didn't you bring the story to a logical stopping point before ending the book?<br /><br />This appears to be a blatant tactic to sell another book, and I flat out do not appreciate it and intend to tell everybody I meet not to buy Sylvia Day books.<br /><br />Author Integrity is Important!  Sylvia Day apparently doesn't have any.
B00992CF6W|5.0|if you're a minecraftee ( I just made it a word) like me you'll love this game. it's very addicting. with the new update it's even better. you can play with friends and with the new update you can now play on relms. if you love to build your own kingdoms this the game for you. I highly recommend this game to a creative person that loves to build kingdoms. its a good game 5 star worthy.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|This was a great movie.  It was hilarious!  It was sweet!  I laughed so hard I cried at the out takes at the end!  Any adult child can relate to this movie!
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|Great Movie. Amazon, it would be nice to be able to rate movies right from my Roku box instead of having to log in to my Amazon account online.
B001KT6JPA|5.0|I watch this movie and I loved the music. Anthony Hopkins does a great job. I was intrigue about his whole movie is about love and that is it. He even cut his own hand for love.
6303142257|3.0|I did not realize this is the video and not the DVD so I was stuck with the Spanish and no subtitles for my kids in English, I am a Spanish teacher.  Also the format is now defunct.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|This album is the natural reaction to the maximalism and overabundance of ornate and multi-layered production from MBDTF. Stripped down and raw, dark and foreboding, Yeezus delivers yet another facet of the multidimensional figure at its center.
B0091REZMW|5.0|very fun to play. could not put down.wish there was more levels<br /><br />was very fun to play.wish there were more levels.

B005WYFLNU|3.0|good choice as a present for girls. The stickers can be reused but it is not very easy to keep them in a good condition after few applications.<br />Good product for the price.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Loved the movie.  Julian Huff did an awesome performance.  I was really surprised and awed at the ending of the movie.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I LOVE these characters, the storyline, the suspense and mystery that is Christian Grey. I couldn't read fast enough. If I didn't have the sequel waiting for me, I would be unbearably heartbroken right now.  Can't wait to lose myself in Fifty Shades Darker!!!
B005MMY9A8|4.0|After seeing the Avengers film and really enjoying it I thought it would be worthwhile to see some of the solo films preceding it. While not quite as action-packed as Avengers I still thought this was a solid film. Plenty of unresolved things left to address in the sequel...
B0007VCZ50|5.0|This film changed my life as a musician.  I've known about this film for years. It's a part of history now to see a rock musician be so versatile with music style.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm not usually a romance novel reader but this is very well written.  Would recommend it to a friend. Good book.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|This is not a book I would normally read; however, my husband had previously read it and picked up another copy for a friend.  We were in the parking lot and I started reading it.  Even though I knew the story and what happened, I continued reading it.  Prior to reading the book, I was rather prejudiced and thought all Germans who fought in WWII were enemies, were Nazis and had no good qualaities.  So glad to learn I was wrong and many of them were good human beings.  I still couldn't tell the difference from one plane from another, but the story is interesting and kept my attention.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I absolutely love these characters and have read every one.  I will be hard pressed to wait for the next installment in December!!!
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|I stream slot of movies & shows. This was the best app by far I've used to watch a show. Never skipped or anything. Definitely recommend.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. It had a bit of everything, but did not seem to overreach.
0062238868|5.0|Chris Kyle was like every SEAL, an American hero.  Anywhere they went, they turned the tide.  His suffering, in the field and back at home is part of this wonderful story.  It is so sad he was lost so young when he had so much to give.
B00DGXGUSY|5.0|There are a few newer sounds on this offering, as well as older sounding stuff (Crusher, Avenger); a few with the feel of Thunder God, Surtur. \\"Hel\\" is one of my favorites, and features something a little different in the chorus. \\"Under Siege,\\" \\"We Shall Destroy,\\" and \\"Coming of the Tide\\" are classic Amon Amarth tracks (Fate, Oden). And the title track is your anthem; your rallying cry!<br /><br />Of course, it's really good stuff!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game ! My child is learning so much from this game , since we can't afford her a real hors e . She is learning so much from this game for example, how to care , treat , compete and love a pet. I suggest you get this game for your child . ;)
B0091REZMW|4.0|f<br /><br />not a bad game. haven't had to pay for anything. frequent ads annoying but it is a freebie.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Great selection of songs.  I love the show!!  Cannot wait for next season.<br />Excellent, quality of mix on every song.
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|...I'll take it over the last 20+ years of Metallica any day! (Sorry, old Skool rant!)<br /><br />This record really gets going in Dance in the Rain, Beginning of Sorrow, and The Blackest Crow (probably my favorite). There is something here for the varying fans of Dave and Megadeth. As with any Megadeth offering, you get awesome tracks and you get \\"fillers.\\" I would definitely add it to my collection if I were you.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Fun and excellent job in the world and its impact on the year in which the game is a great deal to kick off
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Like the idea I can check Facebook when on vacation without having to take my laptop with me.  Helps to keep in touch with family.

Then I came across this SEiKO [which by the way is his favorite, has several] for less then the other not so nice watch.  I was sold and he LOVES it...beautiful piece.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|Hard science fans may have a problem with this book but if you can put that aside I promise you will enjoy this book. It's Robinson Caruso on Mars with Vince Vaughn as Caruso! Our hero is as funny as he is innovative. I hope someone options the movie rights, as it just begs for the big screen Do yourself a favor and buy this, maybe we can encourage Andy to write more like this!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|*5 out of 5 Amazing/disastrous/Edgy Stars**<br /><br />Read my full review at http://romancereaders101.blogspot.com<br /><br />First let me say this is one of my all time favorite books. I know a lot of people gave this book bad reviews, I am NOT one of those people. I love everything about this book. I know there are a lot of negative reviews about it. I read a lot of them before I started but I decided to give it a try anyway. I loved 50 Shades so I looked forward to BD. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and while I respect them I don't agree with the negative ones at all. Yes there were parts that went a little extreme but I didn't think he was going to turn into a serial killer because of his rage. He loved her to the point of insanity.<br /><br />Abby is in college and running from her past. She is the daughter of a notorious poker player and she isn't exactly bad at playing herself. She is smart, funny, and beautiful in an understated kind of way. She's also witty, sarcastic, and independent because she had to be.<br /><br />Travis is Travis Maddox. He's hot, built, tattooed, edgy, broody, and dark. He has serious anger issues and some would say emotional issues. He's is a very controlling and possessive alpha male. His mother died when he was young. He lives in an apartment off campus with his cousin Shep. He's a womanizer with a long list of women on his couch but never in his bed. He drives a motorcycle and fights in an underground fighting ring. He puts the bad in bad boy.<br /><br />\\"It's dangerous to need someone that much. You're trying to save him and he's hoping you can. You two are a disaster.\\"<br /><br />Travis and Abby meet at a fight. She instantly has the nickname Pigeon that he gives her. This is what he calls her throughout the book. She's intrigued by him but doesn't want to admit it or her attraction to him.<br /><br />Their relationship is volatile at best. It's like a ticking time bomb or a train wreck you can't look away from. They are amazing when they are good but when they are bad they bring the whole world down with them. You know they shouldn't be together but you want them to make it!<br /><br />This is an amazing book. I loved all of it. I know some people have issues with Travis and the way he acted, but I think he just loved her to the point he couldn't breathe without her. Pigeon's roommate did make a good point though. She said that he was codependent; he went from having no respect for women to not being able to breathe without her in no time. That doesn't make him crazy though. I give it 5 stars though it deserves more.<br /><br />Way to go Jamie McGuire! My hat is off to you, and I have nothing but love for this book.<br /><br />Favorite Quotes<br /><br />I'm impulsive, and hot-tempered, and you get under my skin like no one else. You act like you hate me one minute, and then you need me the next. I never get anything right, and I don't deserve you...but I f***ing love you, Abby. I love you more than I've loved anyone or anything, ever. When you're around, I don't need booze, or money, or the fighting, or the one-night stands...all I need is you. You're all I think about. You're all I dream about. You're all I want.\\"<br /><br />\\"You know why I want you? I didn't know I was lost until you found me. I didn't know what alone was until the first night I spent without you in my bed. You're the one thing I've got right. You're what I've been waiting for, Pigeon.\\"<br /><br />\\"It's over. Go home.\\" His eyebrows pulled in. \\"You're my home.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm not your anything,\\" I snapped, glaring up at him. His eyebrows pulled in and he stopped dancing. \\"You're my everything.\\"<br /><br />He stomped toward me, planting his hands on the bed and leaning into my face. \\"WELL I BELONG TO YOU!\\"<br />He looked at my lips, panting. \\"I belong to you,\\"are amazing when they are good but when they are bad they bring the whole world down with them. You know they shouldn't be together but you want them to make it!<br /><br />This is an amazing book. I loved all of it.

B005LAIIMG|1.0|I've been to every zombie movie ever made since I was 5 years old and loved them all.  I'm in my 50's and have never walked out of a movie in my life, but a little over an hour into this piece of crap, I couldn't take it anymore.  I left.  The movie was basically close-ups of Brad Pitt's face and scenes of running zombies.  That's all folks!  I don't even CARE how it ended, it was that bad.  I don't know what movie all those people who gave great reviews saw, but it doesn't seem to be the same one I saw.  What a huge waste of my hard-earned money.  I only go to the theater about 4 times per year because I live on a tight budget.  I sure wish I could get my money back on this one.  Monster's University would have been much more entertaining.  I'm going to read the book and forget I ever wasted my money on this garbage.
B00026WU9Q|5.0|It has been a long time since I heard this recording and it is just as good now as it was then. Some of Dylan's best work.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This game is great can't wait to see the new guns that add to it. it is like shooting the real thing love the way you can us the gun grate game love it
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game! I really appreciate the fact that you don't have to be on line to play. The graphics are great and its super adorable
0425256162|1.0|We have an author who seems to have little understanding of elephants, African culture, or dramatic narrative.  So, here is a book that is a dramatic narrative containing African cultural references and elephants.  The result is dang boring.<br /><br />This book never gets off the ground!  Which for a \\"space opera\\" is pretty bad.  The main characters lack zing, our lead hero schlepps around with little enthusiasm, the mystery at the center of the plot never seems to take off, and the result is a slow, drecky climb into a story.  At page 150 I was suffering very badly.<br /><br />Based on an unrecognizable political landscape, with no love of technologies, and very little understanding of how people talk or interact, this is the most cardboard space opera I have ever read, and I cannot recommend it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app it's perfect for horse lover's! At first it's weird then it becomes super fun. : D
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|You should download this by all means. Spot on and pay a little extra to set more alarms with custom sounds
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Excellent cast, smart writing and engaging story lines. I love the revolving door of comedic judges. Kalinda is my favorite character. What's not to like?
B000FBJG04|5.0|I am a WWI, buff and this is by far the best WWII book writtenI .The characters are ordinary Americans, forced to do extra ordinary activities.
B00AZMFO9U|5.0|Although this is a movie about elderly musicians, it is also a story about hope and life, giving all of us the goal of making our last years as full of joy as these people have. The principals are all great actors and much has already been said about them in other reviews, all praise deserved. Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, and Tom Courtenay - we have come to expect amazing performances from them. But the best of them as far as I am concerned was Billy Connolly. His humor and wit not only keep the movie light and enjoyable, but cheer and comfort those around him. He is a true spirit of growing old gracefully, a true morality tale of choosing to enjoy life rather than let it get you down. Another plus in this movie is that most of the musicians in this ensemble are real musicians who have had music careers in their lifetime and are still amazing. The music is fantastic and mixes up all sorts of styles with even an appreciation of 'rap'. Another actor who must be mentioned is Pauline Collins and her portrayal of a woman who is 'losing it'. Here was another example of growing old with dignity and grace, loved by everyone around her. I am sorry that Dustin Hoffman has waited so long to direct a film. He is certainly gifted as a director and I hope he will consider other projects. This film is very highly recommended.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Really didn't expect much but as i was watching it; the movie got really good.  I can't wait for the part 2.
B008602KQI|5.0|Seeing this again on streaming reminded me how good this movie was (I only saw it once in the theater).  I'm curious now to see how the sequel will continue the great storyline.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Thanks for all of your cooperation.  The product was great.  I will consider amazon for my future needs and consideration
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This first book definitely had me engaged enough to finish the book in just a few days. I'm not dying to read the second one right away, but I'll probably buy to see if the authors second attempt is better.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm still crying partly because I don't want it to end and because of the end events of the book. I love the conflict all the characters face whether it be physically or mentally. I also love the pain that author Suzanne makes one feel with just her word she reminds me of peeta kind of in that way. I recommend this book to any and everybody. I hope she writes a spin-off or something, I just need more to devour my ever growing hunger for the hunger games.
B00821OX98|5.0|Not much for TV anymore, but this is a good series. Some of it is predictable and I find myself saying \\"no don't do that\\", like in a cliche scary movie; but then again when we are in the middle of chaos we all seem to do some of those things...
B004SOR4H6|2.0|Timeline won't load. I've had to re download the whole thing like 20 times.now it won't even let me log in.
B0067EKY7M|1.0|To much dialogue especially because of relationships, majority of what comes out of Hollywood these days along with stupid action comic movies. Boring after so much talking, complete turn off for me.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I have this app on my phone also so decided to put it on my kindle fire. So far works great and have not had any problems with it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever played in my life it is really hard to put down
B005544V6A|5.0|I absolutely love this show! I was a little skeptical at first because everyone that I'd spoken to about the show said it was great (which is typically a bad sign for me.lol). However, it does not disappoint. The acting is superb and the legal drama is out of this world!
B005NB5RWM|5.0|Excellent casting, superb battle scenes, very faithful to the book The Killer Angels.  I still wonder why the South fought so hard to preserve slavery -- especially those who did not own slaves.  But one has to stand in awe at the personal courage and willingness to sacrifice displayed on both sides.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is amazing! It's like a pc game!  If u haven't gotten it then get it! It's only free .99
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved the graphics, found the puzzles reasonably challenging, engaged my full attention all afternoon...until I ran out of levels to solve later that evening. I do hope more levels are acfually forthcoming!
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Yes, they are now down 2 original members of the band, but the core of Michael, Scott, and Eddie are still there....And this core has been bottled up for too long.  What a crazy year for Queensryche it has been, and still continues to be, at least until November when the courts decide the fate of the name \\"Queensryche\\"...and if there is justice....This right here IS Queensryche!!  This is the band we grew up and loved...the past 20 yrs have been very hit or miss, the direction of the music, just wasn't Queensryche...yes, all of us core fans would find something of value in each and every album and defend it to no end...but we all knew something was missing....enter this past year and hearing the diva antics of Geoff Tate and his meltdown...then getting the back story to what led to everything...you begin to understand a little bit of what happened to this band....it was more a Tate show then Queensryche!  The rest were bottled up, caged....unable to really ROCK, as they wanted.  Finally, the band broke free, wised up, and stood up to the monopoly of Tate.  And we are all better for it!<br /><br />Queensryche is from top to bottom a return to form!  The album just flat out ROCKS!  Todd LaTorre takes the mantle as lead singer and doesn't hold back!  I will never discount the contributions of Tate to the early success of Queensryche...but the past 20yrs he has steered the ship in the wrong direction.  Todd gets them back on track!  There is absolutely no contest on which Queenryche CD released this year deserves to be called Queensryche and deserves all our hard earned money...It certainly isn't the mess that Tate rushed to release in April!  When I listened to this CD, it was bliss for my ears, I could not believe how this album just brought me back to when I first got into this band back in the 80's...how the musicianship was so good!  You can tell that these boys just wanted to rock & roll and that is what they do on this album!  The only downside, the running time...your just left wanting more!<br /><br />Come November I think Todd and the boys will move on and restore the respect and dignity of the name Queensryche...They deserve it.  Tate does not, he just needs to move along and do the music he wants...his direction is not Queensryche!  This IS!!
B0063M22QO|4.0|I think it is a good starter game. I like that it becomes progressively harder. The characters on the tiles were easy to read.
0770437400|5.0|Not being a fan of horror and eschewing anything related to zombies, I shocked myself when I not only bought World War Z, but read it. I don't read these types of books for a reason--my mind likes to replay scenes over and over while I sleep, giving me nightmares. I Am Legend gave me nightmares for a week and I had to walk out of Warm Bodies.<br /><br />I can hear you laughing from here....<br /><br />Surprisingly enough, I loved this book, and as long as I didn't read it before bedtime and \\"cleansed my brain-palate\\" with another book, I didn't have too many zombie dreams.<br /><br />World War Z is a well-executed and thought-out book, which appealed to my scientific side that craves exploring every scenario and leaving no stone unturned. Presented in interview format, it tells the story of the Zombie apocalypse through firsthand accounts of those who fought and/or survived the war. I particularly enjoyed how Brooks gave us a realistic view of what would happen to the world if the walking dead were a reality and how the living would react upon first hearing the news. How many of us would actually believe that zombies were real? How many governments would take the threat seriously if someone tried to raise the alarm? And how many mistakes and lives would be lost before we started to get something right? It is a chilling tale. And while it does highlight mankind's dependence on technology and the belief that our government will bail us out, these are the issues that cripple mankind in the fight against the zombies. Eventually the living figure out a better way to fight, but not before we are brought to the brink of near extinction and the loss of most of the civilized world. What is left is a planet that is a mere shadow of what it once was and yet not all the changes are negative.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the socio-economic shift of the United States. The prize jobs went to the blue-collar worker with the skills to rebuild a country while the white-collar worker with little skill outside the boardroom became the janitors and labor crews in the war against the zombies. It's almost enough for me to hone the skills I learned growing up on a farm.... Maybe I'll take up welding as a hobby.<br /><br />For the record I refuse to go see the movie. My husband and son saw it, and I know the movie and the book aren't very similar. But either way, I cannot do zombie movies (unless it's Shawn of the Dead, which I found hilarious and not the least bit scary). Do I plan to carve out room on my bookshelf for more horror books? Probably not. But I might be willing to give I Am Legend a try. It's been on my Kindle for a year. Haha!
B005FVNJTS|4.0|An insightful look at a player who doesn't make excuses and tells it how it is. Frank and open account of the good and the bad in a career which has captured the headlines. Comes across as a home boy who likes nothing more than getting back to his roots where he has incredible support. Perhaps not quite as insightful as Andre Agassi's Open but then, Rafa did not have so much to tell.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a good game for avry one I like it so much fun but I still have quadrant it is fun
B000FBJG04|4.0|Its amazing how closely the HBO series follows the book. There was a lot of filler on TV and the book gets right to the meat of the story. I like it.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This is the best case for my VM iPhone 4S.  The case is made of high quality plastic that is truly transparent so it does not cover up the beauty of the phone.  Unlike most cheap plastic case, this one does not have a seam line where your hand meets the phone so it is comfortable to hold.  The case also does not pick up color from your pocket as easily as other plastic TPU cases.  Highly recommended!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This is a fun and addicting game, but it only has ten levels. I got addicted to it in less than a minute, but I finished it in less than a minute too. Needs more levels!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the whole hunger games series because of the, i dont know. Just i loved EVERYTHING! This was actually my favorite book out of series!
0887307280|4.0|Well written and really helped me gain insight into the right approach to starting a business. I found the background stories entertaining although a bit too corny for my liking.
B005VMSATA|4.0|I saw GL in 3D and was pretty unimpressed by their treatment of the Hal Jordan character. I would have given it 2 1/2 stars back then After re-watching the movie at home, however,  I was so impressed with the overall movie--cast, special effects, the alien GLs, plot, and pacing--I was able to overlook how the mature ,family-oriented,  truly fearless Hal Jordan of the comics had been revoltingly turned into an over-aged middle schooler.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Fast accurate weather.  The maps load quickly. Several personal lo&ccedil;ations makes it easy to check condotions in you current area or where you're headed.  Works great on my droid and kindle fire.
B00846REIS|5.0|Excellent book series!!!read them twice suggested them to friends & family. Hoping the author continues the series.<br />Thanks for the books
B008OOYALE|4.0|I love playing this game.  The dragons are adorable and the missions keep it interesting. The only qualm I have is the expansion process; I don't mind paying to expand, but it also costs up to an additional 50,000 coins just to clear a single tree. We're getting crowded.
159562015X|5.0|If you ever wondered what your natural talents are, this is a great way to find out.  I have used this for around 150 employees as a tool for training, teamwork and communication with great results.  I've never had a person tell me they felt their results were wrong.  By sharing results, it opens the door for understanding others around you.  In a team, that is a key component to success.
B009R659L8|5.0|Where do authors get the germ for a novel?  If I could answer that, I guess I could attempt a book like this too.  It was a page turner and quite unpredictable.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Great to have the REAL Queensryche back. Wondering who exactly held them back after Promised Land, through the embarrassment that was Cabaret, to the childish depths of \\"FU\\" (\\"Frequently Unsold\\") ? Look no further, it's pretty clear who was at fault and he's no longer in the band. Better late than Never.<br /><br />Especially impressed with Scott on this album, and the running time is fine, quality over quantity, many of my favorite albums run around this length.<br /><br />Normally I would deduct a star for the brickwall sound, but I bought the vinyl in the hopes that it won't be as bad.<br /><br />But knowing that before long the Tater-Tots will be in here writing 1-sentence 1-star reviews (sometimes in ALL CAPS BECAUSE NO ONE HAS SHOWN THEM WHERE THE CAPS LOCK IS) I'm giving it 5 as a counteract measure to keep this where at belongs which is actually 4 stars imho.
B008JFUPOY|4.0|I loved Monsters, Inc.; it's still one of my favorite Pixar movies. It's a touching movie about friendship and the lengths one monster goes to for a friendship even when he doesn't necessarily agree with his friend. And the relationship between Sully and Boo brought a tear to my eye in his willingness to let go of something that he loves to do what is best for that something. That something being Boo. However, it's the challenging of the norms that make the film standout. It's the demonstration that we ought to be constantly questioning the status quo and tradition so that we know whether there are better ways, now, than there were when those traditions were established that make the film really shine. [And I would bet money on it being a subtle jab at Disney, whom Pixar had fight every step of the way to get Toy Story out in the form we saw it in, because Disney wanted a more traditional story.]<br /><br />But there is none of that in Monsters University. It is, in every way possible, a standard Disney film. Well, okay, maybe it's not standard Disney, but it's certainly standard. Two guys, rivals, have to learn to work together to overcome some great obstacle and, in so doing, they learn they are great partners. And, because of that, friends. It's the plot of virtually every buddy cop movie out there. Except Monsters U is in a school setting. There is nothing in the movie that is beyond typical.<br /><br />Which is not to say that it's not enjoyable, because it is. Very enjoyable. It just doesn't feel like Pixar; it feels like Disney. Safe. Traditional. And that's disappointing. Because what we learned from Pixar is that traditional, for them, was challenging tradition. But that was before Disney. Don't get me wrong, Disney can make great films, but they are hardly ever challenging.<br /><br />All of that said, Monsters U was enjoyable. It was fun to get to see Sully and Mike again and, even, Randall. Dean Hardscrabble was a great, new character, completely freaky,and Helen Mirren was excellent in the role. I wouldn't have wanted her paying any kind of personal attention to me. No, not even to tell me good job, because even \\"good job\\" from her would seem to carry some kind of menace.<br /><br />Visually, the movie made no improvements over its predecessor. In fact, the animation seemed flatter. More plastic. But, then, it has been a while since I watched Monsters, Inc. so there may be some amount of idealization going on in my head as far as that goes. Still, after more than 10 years, you'd expect some amount of improvement, especially after the richness of the animation in Brave.<br /><br />Many people say that it's unfair to judge Pixar movies by their previous endeavors, but I don't really agree. That's kind of like saying you shouldn't judge a McDonald's cheeseburger by other McDonald's cheeseburgers. Pixar did, after all, establish what a Pixar movie should be like. They are also the ones that have allowed Disney to mess with their recipe, which it's hard to fault Disney for since they own Pixar, now. However, these new Pixar burgers don't taste quite the same, quite as good, as the old ones. So, it may be true that Monsters University is a fine a movie, which it is, but it's not a fine Pixar movie. Of that, it falls short.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|So far we own everything by ZeptoLab... and this game just exceeds the expectations set the last game... Got my vote to game of the year :)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I rarely give five stars but this one was worth it.  I'd read the first book before and felt it was complete in itself so hadn't bothered to read further books.  Boy am I glad I finally did because the author develops the story in a completely new direction and turned the whole thing into something that keeps you thinking about it long after the book is finished.
1400079144|1.0|If I had known the book would be in this condition I certainly would not have bought it from this retailer.  Front cover folded and curled, pages curled and stained.  Sold as &#34;Used, Very Good&#34; would hate to see what state &#34;Good&#34;  or &#34;Bad&#34;  were in - will definitely not buy from this retailer again
B00BSBVLF8|3.0|I was expecting a little more story line.  The acrobats were wonderful and my daughter loved trying some of the things they did.  I just got a little bored.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I get lost in the pleasure and challenge of this game. The graphics are intriguing and easy to follow. Some games frustrate because they are so difficult to follow, but this one moves along and takes you with it. Time flies when I am moving my tiles..
B008220C38|1.0|bad remake of an excellent movie  Totally superficial<br />Plastic actors and actresses should not have wasted the money on it
B00CCEHR80|5.0|This Summer 1990 show may be even better than Volume One.  With the addition of singers Gloria Jones and Jaclyn Labranch, Garcia's voice blends with Jones and Labranch into something quite nice when they're together.  But overall, Garcia's vocals are some of his better efforts-strong and clean.  A few highlights:  Just listen to the first track, \\"How Sweet It Is...\\", and you'll hear what I mean about the vocals.  Garcia sings out front and Jones and Labranch join in on the chorus.  And listen to Garcia's guitar.  His molten notes just get fired out in cleanly picked succession.  And Melvin Seals' organ is the perfect foil for Garcia.  But then the entire set is like that.  This volume floats between 4 and 5 \\"stars\\", but is closer to 5 \\"stars\\".<br /><br />Dylan's \\"Forever Young\\" is taken at a perfect, slow pace, which lets the lyrics shine though.  Garcia's \\"Run For The Roses\\", with the additional vocalists contributing in the background is tight and fine.  And as usual Garcia gets off another great solo.  But check out \\"Tears Of Rage\\" and \\"Deal\\"--two more great versions from this concert--what a way to spend a Sunday afternoon!  Garcia (especially) and the band really give these two tunes a fine workout.  These two versions will put a smile on your face.  Even early on in this set, there's something almost magical about the performances here.  It's obvious that Garcia is full of energy--both vocally and instrumentally. And his band are with him every step of the way.<br /><br />Discs Two starts off with \\"Midnight Moonlight\\", featuring banjo wiz Bela Fleck.  This Peter Rowan tune harks back to earlier country/folk days.  But Jones and Labranch give it a bit more of a contemporary feel.  Seals organ fills are just right--never overpowering the song, yet adding depth to the sound.  Garcia's solo is one of the best here--full of that Garcia/country sound he pulls off so well.  Fleck is again featured on Jimmy Cliff's \\"The Harder They Come\\", a tune Garcia has played countless times in the various configurations of his bands.  The juxtaposition of the tune's melody and Fleck's banjo make for a different listening experience.  One of the highlights has to be \\"And It Stoned Me\\".  Garcia keeps to the well known melody and tempo, but his vocal is beautiful.  His relaxed vocal is just right for this song.  \\"Evangeline\\" is an uptempo countryish tune, complete with Garcia's version of rockabilly guitar.  This is another highlight from this set.  The concert ends with Dylan's \\"Tangled Up In Blue\\".  Once again the entire band (Garcia, Seals, Jones, Labranch, John Kahn-bass, and David Kemper-drums) shine on this great vehicle for Garcia.  His vocal is yet another fine effort.  But the real highlight is his guitar solo--note after soaring note--and he doesn't let up until he feels like it.  And with the band falling in behind him, this is another great track.<br /><br />If this is the kind of release we can expect in the future--I can hardly wait.  If you're a fan you've already purchased this.  If you're not familiar with Garcia's work outside The Dead, this is a fine example of his talents at this later stage of his career.  For those who said that Garcia's playing and singing was becoming lazy or repetitive, this will put paid to those thoughts.  Yes, some of the tunes are familiar from past Garcia performances, but the energy he and the band throw off, even on the more familiar tunes, is Garcia close to his best.  The 6 page booklet has a color photo of Garcia and Fleck playing together, and another great shot of the entire band on stage, plus the usual band/track info.  Check it out and let the music do it's magic.tless times in the various configurations of his bands.  The juxtaposition of the tune's melody and Fleck's banjo make for a different listening experience.  One of the highlights has to be \\"And It Stoned Me\\".  Garcia keeps to the well known melody and tempo, but his vocal is beautiful.  His relaxed vocal is just right for this song.  \\"Evangeline\\" is an uptempo countryish tune, complete with Garcia's version of rockabilly guitar.  This is another highlight from this set.  The concert ends with Dylan's \\"Tangled Up In Blue\\".  Once again the entire band (Garcia, Seals, Jones, Labranch, John Kahn-bass, and David Kemper-drums) shine on this great vehicle for Garcia.  His vocal is yet another fine effort.  But the real highlight is his guitar solo--note after soaring note--and he doesn't let up until he feels like it.  And with the band falling in behind him, this is another great track.<br /><br />If this is the kind of release we can expect in the future--I can hardly wait.  If you're a fan you've already purchased this.  If you're not familiar with Garcia's work outside The Dead, this is a fine example of his talents at this later stage of his career.  For those who said that Garcia's playing and singing was becoming lazy or repetitive, this will put paid to those thoughts.  Yes, some of the tunes are familiar from past Garcia performances, but the energy he and the band throw off, even on the more familiar tunes, is Garcia close to his best.  The 6 page booklet has a color photo of Garcia and Fleck playing together, and another great shot of the entire band on stage, plus the usual band/track info.  Check it out and let the music do it's magic.
B00C7JAAH0|5.0|I've only recently started listening to this bands albums (I always hear their hits on the radio) and I have to say they really do a nice job of playing great music.
B000I8G5GW|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater when it came out originally and haven't seen it since then but it still holds up after almost 50 years. Holden, a heavy drinker, said later that he was so drunk during the filming that he couldn't remember doing any of the scenes. I was looking for signs of that as I watched this movie but I couldn't tell anything was amiss. If you like great acting there is a lot of that in this movie by many people.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I guess that this series is alright for teen audiences interested in the whole monsters and magic genre. It was an interesting read, and had some good storyline to it, but it lacked the eloquence and sophistication of some of the more popular titles in the genre.
B00CHRB9RM|5.0|THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE 4 CD 40TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION.<br /><br />Plane and simple--if you like the original album--you need to purchase this new edition of this classic album.  All the good things in the original album are still here, but magnified several times over.  The original album was a real test to see if the ABB would continue to make good, vital, exciting music.  The answer was obvious on first listening to the original album.  And now we have both studio and live tracks that add substantially to the original albums listening experience.  With both Duane Allman and Berry Oakley gone, the core sound of the band shifted towards both Gregg Allman and Dickie Betts.  Together they helped push the bands sound into something slightly different.<br /><br />Nothing much needs to be said about the original album--it stands as a classic.  But where things begin to get interesting is in the unheard studio tracks.  Listen to a more laid back version of \\"Wasted Words\\".  The slower tempo and Betts' slide guitar give this a tune a lighter feel.  \\"Trouble No More\\" sounds more like a finished track than simply a rehearsal version.  \\"One Way Out\\" is an instrumental--sounding like a backing track--but it has some typically fine Betts' guitar.  \\"I'm Gonna Move To The Outskirts Of Town\\" combines Allman's jazzy organ and Betts' country inflected blues guitar.  Allman gives this song one of his typically good blues vocals.  This tune was used by the band to see if pianist Chuck Leavell would fit into the band--check out his playing and hear for yourself.  The old Elmore James tune \\"Done Somebody Wrong\\" has no real surprises, but starting with this tune,  all the rest of the tracks feature Lamar Williams on bass.  \\"Early Morning Blues\\" is another bluesy outtake that has a nice Allman vocal, and some typically fine playing by the band.  Listen to \\"Jelly Jelly\\" on the original album--the same tune with different lyrics.  \\"A Minor Jam\\" quickly fades in and includes the band minus Allman and Betts.  Guitarist Les Dudek replaces Betts, and his tone and phrasing is very reminiscent of Betts' style.  Chuck Leavell handles the piano chores, and at times sounds like a combination of Allman's style and his own.  All through the jam there's a subtle intensity, a build up and release of tension, not only between Dudek and Leavell, but the entire band.  The band continues playing until the tune ends fairly abruptly.<br /><br />But the live set is the real jewel here.  Of the sixteen tunes over the two discs,, eleven are previously unreleased.  The other five tracks can be heard on the \\"Dreams\\" and \\"Wipe The Windows, Check The Oil, Dollar Gas\\" sets.  This live concert is certainly one of the best from this band.  There's no wasted notes, no noodling, just one of the finest bands in music doing what they do best.  Betts, who doesn't really like playing slide guitar, steps up and shows his mastery of that style time after time.  His playing has a combination of finesse and toughness.  Allman is in fine voice, and the rest of the band is tight and alive sounding.  Song after song, their ensemble playing is solid, intuitive, and exciting.  Everything seems to come together--no matter what the tempo.  I was going to pick some highlights, but its ridiculous to try.<br /><br />Of the unreleased live tracks, listen to this bands \\"Stormy Monday\\".  Fans familiar with other versions will still find this workhorse tune worth hearing.  \\"Midnight Rider\\" is another great version of this Gregg Allman composition.  The ragged vocals really fit this world weary tune.  And listen to Betts' slide work on Blind Willie McTell's \\"Statesboro Blues\\".  \\"Come And Go Blues\\" (heard on the original album) sticks close to the original, but has an edgy flow to it.  \\"Jessica\\" is really nice here.  There's a certain feel of this live version different from the album version that makes you wish you were standing in that hall in person.  \\"Les Brers In A Minor\\", at 25+ minutes, is the longest track here, and for people lucky enough  to have heard the ABB live during this period, this will bring back those memories.  The playing is tough yet jazz like in spots.  Listen to the electric piano work and you'll hear what I mean.  This tune shows that the band wasn't tied to a strictly blues sound.  There's a nine minute drum solo which then incorporates Williams' bass, and then shifts back to the entire band before ending.  This track is definitely a highlight for a number of reasons.<br /><br />Betts' \\"Blue Sky\\" sounds close to the original, but has that ABB sound that gives it something extra.  Leavell's piano is just right for this loping countryish tune.  The intensity picks up with \\"Trouble No More\\".  This is prime ABB from this period.  The final tune is \\"Whipping Post\\" (no surprise) and the band instantly grabs this tune and injects it with a life of its own.  Once again Leavell proves his worth on the piano, acting at times like a second lead instrument, and a foil for Betts' guitar work.  Everyone is familiar with the Fillmore East version which is so intense it sounds dangerous.  On this version the band uses their new configuration to great effect--a \\"that was then this is now\\" feel--and it works.  All in all, nothing is wasted.  The playing is sharp, visceral, and exciting.  ABB fans need to hear this live set in its entirety.<br /><br />Its apparent that great care was taken with the sound.  Its crisp and clean, but without any harshness.  Individual instruments can clearly be picked out throughout both the studio and live tracks.  The packaging is pretty nice.  The paperback size holder folds out five times.  There's four slots for the discs, but I cringe every time I slide one out--I've since put the discs in double jewel cases.  The 31 page attached booklet has an essay on the band and the music, along with individual track information.  Except for the cover, the booklet and packaging have some unseen photos of the band in both color and b&w.  This is a nice presentation of a landmark album.  An album now made even better with all the additional music.  Miss this at your own peril.  This has been a good week for live releases.  Besides this set, \\"Volume Two\\" from the Jerry Garcia Band has also been released.

B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I really enjoyed the game a whole lot but it seemed a little short and the ending left me hanging. I hope they come out with a sequel soon.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I really enjoyed this game but since the latest upgrade I can not open it. I hope I don't loose all I have accomplished. :(

B000O8OTNC|4.0|Really handy sharpener. Carry in my pack, its that handy. The blades are sharpened easily and I recommend it for field use.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|This game is very well made, the graphics are great and game play is easy to pick up. I've played Yugioh for years and dabble in Magic the gathering every now and then and this game reminds me of those games. (Magic more so of course because of the use of mana). The only issue I have with this game as mentioned by many reviewers before me, is the difficulty of obtaining cards. (This reminds me of Yugioh before they start doing reprints and a game breaking card costs $150 and the people who can afford the card have a huge advantage over those who can not). I haven't been playing this game that long an  already I came up against someone with legendary cards and I haven't beat them yet. The game loses a star for ridiculous card prices but other than that it's a really good game, keeps you engaged and it's free.
B00DF0POXA|2.0|I'm a big KW fan, but this is just a bad impersonation of a Def Poet gathering.  To be fair I only listened to the free 30sec clips, but I didn't hear anything that inspired me to buy them.  I had hoped he'd come from the lab with a mix of upbeat swagger infused chorus', but this is not the case. Maybe there's an audience for this dark quazi black power melodramatic prose, but I'm not digging it.  Just because it's played on the radio doesn't mean it can't be powerful (hello Jesus Walks and Through the Wire).  The beats just feel lazy to me.  Not one of these is good enough to play loud enough at the light for the car next to me to hear me....you hear me?
B00C2VGB30|5.0|This album (\\"Love Songs\\") is Vanessa's strongest collection of songs since her debut album. The songs have interesting melodies and encompass a nice variety of styles. You will hear nice silky arrangements with strings on some songs, while other selections incorporate bongos and seem to fuse African and Spanish styles together (in my opinion). Then there are some songs that seem to have a folk like 60's hippie rock style as well.<br /><br />I have the Deluxe Edition which comes in a larger cover and adds 2 bonus tracks. The one thing that's a little strange to me is the fact that all of the songs (INCLUDING the bonus tracks) could have been put on ONE DISC. (Disc 1 is only 35 minutes long and the second disc is just over 42 minutes).  To me, this is really a single album that was spread out over two discs. (I'm not complaining, as I really like this album.)<br /><br />The artwork and packaging on this album is excellent as well. It comes with a poster and an interesting booklet containing all the lyrics for the songs. (I wish I could speak French to understand what the lyrics are saying.)<br /><br />If you are a Vanessa Paradis fan, you will really like this album. The songs have great melodies, a variety of interesting styles, and really ARE brimming with love (just as the album title \\"Love Songs\\" suggests).
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|Some may say that with this album Queensryche are trying to duplicate their past glories, attempting to recapture their sound from 25 years ago - as if it were some sort of pejorative.  On the contrary, that is what the majority of their fans have been missing over the past couple of decades.  The mediocre midtempo dad-rock foisted upon the fans during the Tate-led Queensryche era resulted in ever-decreasing album and ticket sales over time.<br /><br />Thankfully, this album *is* a return to form for Queensryche. The \\"signature sound\\" is in full effect here.  Harmony leads are back in abundance.  Soaring operatic vocals courtesy new vocalist Todd La Torre.  The rhythm section is in prime form, charging through the songs as if their lives depended on it.<br /><br />I won't do a track-by-track breakdown, but this album would fit comfortably in the Rage for Order - Promised Land timeline. There's a couple of tracks that are on the average side, but by and large the songs are top notch.  The claim that Rockenfield, Jackson, and Wilton were incapable of bringing anything to the songwriting table is proven on this album to be hollow and without merit.<br /><br />Some criticisms have been leveled at Todd La Torre for being a Tate clone.  He has said all along that Tate was one of his primary influences.  And he's being backed by 3/4 of the original musicians.  So it's not a huge surprise that yeah, at times he sounds like Tate - though Tate from 20 years ago (which is a far cry from the shell of a vocalist he has become after years of smoking and drinking).  This is not a bad thing - do people really want another Blaze Bayley that can't do the classic material justice?  But La Torre is by no means aping Tate's mannerisms throughout.  He brings his own style to the table, and it's a welcome change from the nasally vocals that defined QR's output over the past decade.<br /><br />Now for criticisms.  The album is too short - some of my favorite QR songs in the past were the longer, more epic tracks like Suite Sister Mary and Roads to Madness.  Nothing here clocks in over 4 minutes and change.  On more than one occasion a song ends just as it is really getting going.  I realize there is wisdom in leaving the audience wanting more, but at the same time it almost feels artificially short.  And the \\"brick wall\\" mastering is overwhelming at times - though sadly very very few bands have any say in the mastering process.<br /><br />But overall, this is the album I was hoping Queensryche would put out ever since my disappointment with Hear in the Now Frontier.  Finally, after 15+ years of waiting and hoping, they have delivered.

B000021Y7X|5.0|Stop Making Sense has some of the best versions of Talking Heads songs, I think, in their entire career. Live versions of popular singles as well as lesser-known gems are infused with soulful backup singers and an intense percussion set. The film itself is entertaining, silly and well-thought out the whole way through. If you love Talking Heads, chances are looking good you will fall in love with this movie!
B00AEFXESQ|5.0|I watched this movie 6 years ago and I was shock how deep it reflected on life's meaning and the shallowness of consumer society.

B00D41H2PS|5.0|Had a wonderful time playing this game. I liked the fact it was all point and click, with no hidden object games. Lately many HO have been pointless, with no penalty for random clicks. No challenge at all. So this game made my day!!!
B005FVNJTS|4.0|A good enjoyable read that gives you a bit more insight into the player, obviously early on for such a book but helps you to understand what makes the man tick.
B000FC0V3E|4.0|I know this is a classic and I have been trying to read the classics I missed when I was younger.  I liked it, but I didn't love it....not something I would go back and read again.  The relationship between the characters was confusing to me and I didn't understand how they all came to be together on that adventure...they didn't seem to really like each other.  I probably need to study more about Hemingway as I feel he put a lot of himself into the story.  Glad I read it, just to say I did.
1400049628|5.0|It made a great gift for a Walking Dead fan.  The recipient really enjoyed this book. He is going to put it in his Zombie Survival Kit and put it on display.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|People should buy this app more than the other apps so I think people would be smart enough to know this app is free and great so go to the app store  and  get this app now of you did thanks for your kind heart.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|An excellent final to the dragon tattoo series. Recommend you read the first two books in order to really have the impact. Would have been 5 stars if the middle hadn't added so many new characters that it slowed the pace down a bit too much for me. Only regret now that there are no more new books from Stieg Larsson to read!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is built to let you learn how to take care of a real horse, and that is what they are doing. 5 out of 5 for me!
B0096PAA6E|2.0|i saw this guy on the saturday early show he played 2 songs that blew me away , i immediately went and bought this album, there are maybe 3 songs that are really good, the rest sound like typical radio friendly r&b and pop, i was very dissapointed! this guy shoul not be labled as blues, i will stick with stevie ray,jimi,clapton,muddy waters etc., wasted 13 dollars!
B0092S4WLY|1.0|It used to be there was an ad bar somewhere on the screen, OR pop-up ads between levels. THIS app has BOTH. That's way too many ads. there are also glitches in this game.

B00D6BN9NK|2.0|I am a true Die Hard fan. Loved them all, except this one. To contrived with no real story line. It seemed that it was a string of action sequences spliced together with no real story. It was a real contrivance how John finds his son at the beginning of the movie--give me a break.
B001FAFO3W|4.0|Not Disney, but close!  Good music. Great character development and story telling.  John Cusack is great, Meg Ryan's all right.

B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I have been a Ryche fan since the EP came out 30 yrs ago ( I was 21) they are amongst by top 5 favorite bands ( The others being Priest, Maiden, Sabbath & Led Zeppelin)<br />When I heard that Queensryche was coming out with another album I was praying for something decent, since the last few albums have really not grabbed me at all, I heard some of Tates Queensryche music and was totally turned off. ( plus him being a jerk now). But then when I heard the samples first coming out of this new album there was a energy I havent heard from the band since the late 80's! Todd has givin the band the boost it needed to keep the music alive I heard pieces of Mindcrime and Empire and even a little Warning! Now we are talking! then when they streamed the entire album for the fans I was blown away! They are back! I understand there will always be fans of Tate ( I have been since the beginning and his one of my vocal mentors), but the realization that his vision was on a different path that the rest of the band and you can hear it on this album, the fans have been screaming for some of those classic QRyche sounds and I must say it's on this album! So give it a chance, I think you will enjoy the hell out of it ( I am)!! I can say I am wearing my Tri-Ryche tattoo with pride now!<br />Some of my faves on this album are:<br /><br />Spore<br />In This Light<br />A World Without<br />Don't Look Back<br />Open Road<br /><br />I spoke with Todd on facebook and they are writing songs for  a follow up to this so get ready fans!!<br />Long Live Queensryche!
B003EI2EH2|1.0|Most of this was devoted to very extreme weight loss measures, that seem pretty unhealthy.  The author lays everything out as being simple or easy, but suggests major lifestyle changes that would be anything but easy.  The workout methods presented are not for the faint of heart uncoordinated or unathletic.  These might be good methods for athletes or people who devote their lives to fitness.  I would not try any of this without seeing a doctor first and getting their okay.

I have tried so many different mice that were name brand here and no name brand mice in which i know 75% is how it feels, 20% is how it functions and 5% is how it looks when it comes down to mice.  The Anker 8000 is my top pick, this is the most comfortable mouse I have ever used and the pushed out extra button for the thumb in the middle is a god send for whomever thought of that it has been my savior button in most cases like dodge on resident evil rev. or sprint on tomb raider.  U need a mouse pad just as warning for it to work as smooth as possible and any pad will do go to target and get a 3-5$ pad doesn't matter but the Anker wont dissapoint.  If you are unsure of what kind of mouse to get whether it be for shooting, rpg, strategy, or action pick this, it should be your first choice anyway but hey I know people are picky.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This was an interesting first person style story.<br />The balance of action and introspection was good with nicely developed characters.<br />With the current jobs situation where Washington DC keeps getting richer and the heartland loses more and more jobs, this book gets more politically interesting.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|This film was a little perplexing.  It had A LOT going on and the story jumps around which can be hard to follow but the concept was brilliant.  Wish I'd read the book first.  Tom and Halle were both great and the supporting cast as well.  The best part of this film was the costumes and make-up...cannot believe the transformations of some of the actors into different characters- it was fun to guess who played who!
B000VD9MG4|4.0|This is more-or-less Tarentino's stab at a grindhouse-style movie long before creating the actual movie \\"Grindhouse\\" (or at least his half of it). The movie is far too sadistic, violent, and gory to be, say, 'enjoyed' to any degree, but that's the point. It just keeps getting worse and worse until a select few can watch it to the end, where your queasiness is rewarded by a grand turnaround finale, where the tortured become the torturers.<br /><br />BTW, don't waste your time on [[ASIN:B000UJ48OU Hostel - Part II [Blu-ray]]], which was an independent movie Tarentino actually REFUSED to help with. It totally misses the point Hostel 1 was trying to make (violence for violence's sake is the sign of a truly madman/woman) and instead just displays horribly gory sequences one after another. [[ASIN:B005OK728O HOSTEL PART III]] I saw LONG ago, but I remember being at least mildly entertained by.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Well, I have to say I loved this book. Scary in some places, endearing in others, and yes it made me laugh in some places and cry in others. My only dislike is it was too short. I fell in love with nearly all the characters and the story and didn't want it to end. If there were a second book I would have bought it up immediately and with out hesitation after finishing this one. Happy reading.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love that I can keep my grocery list, meal plan, and<br />calendar all in one place.  This app is easy to use and<br />great for taking notes.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Good film.  Very off-beat and quirky but quite entertaining.  The cast was amazing- Ed Norton and Bruce Willis were both great.  This was a huge reach for Bruce, and I loved it.  Very endearing story line.
B004ZNB12O|5.0|my son loves the older groups and pink Floyd was a great choice..cd came quickly and it plays well..no probelms
B008UTV6S8|5.0|Amazing how good Paul Simon still is. In many respects these songs I have loved so long sound fresh and original.Hearing them 'live' present day is a real treat.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|love this author. you will ride an emotional roller coaster and will not put down this page turner- I promise you!
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|I enjoyed the story of Alfred Hitchcock and the unique and real representation of his relationships.  It was interesting to see the story behind the man and what made him tick- how he pressed the limits.  Hitchcock was an artist as is Hopkins.  He can do no wrong with me.  Would recommend this film.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|Beautiful in every way ... but had to watch it using our laptop, as it was area one (USA) and we are in the UK.<br />Have sent it back to Amazon (which was easy) and have purchased one from within the UK which will play on our DVD ... Hope it will be wide-screen, but if not the film will still be brilliant..
B00BHXUC4S|5.0|Great hearing Jeff channel rockabilly and &#34;The Electric Light Orchestra.&#34; He sounds as strong as ever. A fine album. The songs are infectious and bear repeated listening.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i dont remember how long it took me to read, but i do remember hardly getting sleep because i would stay up literally all night and read Hunger Games. And when i finished, i couldnt stop thinking about it. It didnt take long to fall in love with the  characters. Katniss and Peeta's relationship was cute and romantic though there were some twists. Hunger Games is also VERY thrilling. Suzanne Collins has a wild imagination. Her writing really makes you feel like you're there. i kept thinking to myself &#34;Would i survive in the hunger games?&#34; this book made me laugh, cry, think, go &#34;aww!&#34;, and put me on the edge of my seat. i cant wait til Catching Fire the movie comes out :)
B004KPHQR6|1.0|A. How did this get 4 stars?<br /><br />B. Why does everybody in 1943 have hair styles inspired by the cast of Family Ties? Did the director not have pictures from the WWII era?<br /><br />C. If you see someone claim this had \\"good effects\\" for this time, think about Star Wars that was made 7 years earlier. It was good for its time. This is craptacular.
0345535421|4.0|At this point I am already invested in the characters and in the story itself. There are a lot of interesting twists in the story and things never go the way you think they will. It keeps it interesting. This book is a little darker than the first with black magic being introduced into the story. I don't like that part, but it only occurs a few times in the book. This book also has a lot more violence because the Kings are now going to war. One thing I really noticed with this book is that there is a lot of brutality, rape, and violence towards the women in this book. I know that it fits with the context of the story and the era it is written in, but it does bother me. Some deaths really took me by surprise, but it's something I am getting used to with this book series. This book has chapters from new character's perspectives, which I wasn't expecting, but it is important in the story development. I am ready to start book 3 and find out what happens next!
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|Wow, I can't believe my good fortune in discovering this collection of Steven Stills songs. Four discs covering his entire career. He is one of the reasons, &#34;Crosby, Stills and Nash&#34; were so good. Yet, he easily stands on his own.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Ahh! That is the only word i can think of to sum up all the amazingness that are in these books :)
B0042J6VUS|1.0|This tripod DOES NOT fit an iPod or iPhone. Broke the first time I even tried to fit my iPhone in it... I'm so super disappointed because I ordered three of these and they ALL broke the first time I handled them.
B00AG297GK|4.0|This is a funny movie if  ou like this kind of thing. It is certainly different. Some not so nice scenes.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|I love this album. The Beach Boys sound as good as ever. This is a wonderful 'live' album of songs. Nice to hear Brian Wilson's beautiful voice. He still has it. This proves that Beach Boys music is eternal.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Very thought provoking book, didn't realize that this was done in our country for such a long period of time.  As with so many things that were done here in earlier times, you just have to ask why did the do this to these children?
B00CW665VI|5.0|I swear it sounded like a guy wrote this and it was hilarious.  Laugh out loud funny in parts.  It was sweet and Drew was anything but predictable which was refreshing.  Enjoyed it!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|You know, there is a lot of political &#34;information&#34; on TV these days, but most of it just involves mud-sliniging back & forth. Revisiting &#34;The West Wing&#34; reminds me that these are arguments that have been going on for decades, it's just that now the mud has gotten stickier! Unfortunately for us all, recent administrations have lacked the wit & knowledge of their fictional counterparts. It is a tru pleasure to hear C.J. duel verbally with everyone - I am reminded of why she is my favorite character. Five stars for this excellent collection, with its discs of special extras that truly takes you behind the scenes & makes us wish for the good old days of &#34;real&#34; television.
B0086449YA|5.0|I have a radio show and was playing this CD. People called the station loving the songs. Goes to prove, Mark is an original talent with or without his great band, &#34;Dire Straits.&#34; So happy to have 2 CDs of original songs to hear.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I have read both other books by Dr. Hosseini and enjoyed the read both times.  The other books had much more depth and heart than &#34;And the Mountains Echoed&#34;.  The bones of this book are there but the character development needs work.  I remember details of the first two books even though I read them years ago.  I would have to go back and look up the names of the characters in this one.  It was a disappointment.
B003J7HOKU|2.0|I first got into Parkway Drive with Horizons and I was blown away. Every song was good and the production was incredible. I was super excited to get Deep Blue and then it came...I plugged it in and the first thing I noticed was how awful the production was. Especially coming from Horizons which sounded so professional and crisp and perfectly mixed, the Deep Blue production was so amateur and the guitar tone sounded like they were playing out of practice amps in a basement. The song content was not bad, but not good by any means. I just felt that the catchy Parkway Drive riffs and tight breakdowns from Horizons were pushed aside and the album content to me just felt \\"forced.\\" I'm not a hater by any means and I'm a huge Parkway Drive fan; I love they guys and I thought they redeemed themselves with Atlas which is a great album and highly recommended.<br /><br />Just being honest, no hate. Skip this album and if you're new to Parkway Drive, I'm begging you DO NOT start with this album. Start with Horizons and explore from there.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|It costs too much money : only fish and occassional treasure chests give pearls,  and the treasure chests cost pearls to begin with.  Some fish eat 16,000 algea so far and if you don't have enough it costs $20 for only 6,000 units of algea,  not even enough for one of those fish and they both seem to need to be fed at the same Time.  I have planted a rediculous amount of rare plants and cannot seem to get any more rare fish.  The game is rigged to get the player to buy more and more pearls,  and algea.  Very expensive at $20 a pop.
B00B97SNJI|5.0|What I love about Dawes is their sound. Part Eagles, Poco, Byrds and strains of California folk-rock. So happy to hear this sound again. Their latest offering, &#34;Stories Don't End&#34; is even better than their first release. A good sign that they are with us for a while.
B00CMYRSQG|5.0|On their fifth studio album, AUGUST BURNS RED continue to develop into one of the best metalcore bands there ever was with RESCUE AND RESTORE, which is also one of the best albums of the year. I'm actually very surprised that AUGUST BURNS RED had branched out much more than they have on previous records. Not to say that this album strays away completely from metalcore, but there are certainly a number of different musical instruments brought forth into their sound, such as stringed instruments, congas, and even a horn section at the end of CREATIVE CAPTIVITY, which is my least favorite track and is actually a terrible song. (I'm not going to knock this album down because of it, but still, the song is horrible. I won't go into detail here, but please listen to the song in full, and you'll see why I don't like it.) They even tune down their guitars to Drop B for the songs PROVISION and FAULT LINE, which is right up there with PARADOX and WHITE WASHED as one of the best AUGUST BURNS RED songs. Also, Dustin (the bassist) has more of a presence on this record, both vocally and musically, and even though Jake Luhrs is beast when it comes to vocals, Dustin's contribution is definitely not a bad thing! Overall, if you want an honest metalcore album that is set to break boundaries more than ever before, pick this album up.<br /><br />Rating: 4.9 stars/5 stars
B003B02O0A|5.0|I just love the characters, the South's got some doozies, but really love the heart that Grisham puts into every book!  My top 3 Grisham book's change every time a read a new one and this one is fighting for the top spot! You'll truly enjoy reading, laughing and even crying this excellent book!!
B007IK44CK|4.0|Liked it, adventure, action spirited, liked the special effects and of course all the actors.  OK I have to put in 5 more words.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I had a lot of fun playing these puzzles. I did get aggravated a few times because of getting stuck. It would be nice to be able to get a hint once in a while. I did beat all 10 levels without the hints but I would not have been as annoyed if I had the option to get a hint. I am sad that all the levels are over though because overall I had a lot of fun. The blue weight on level six had me stumped for a while. The answer was definitely out of the box. 168=12x14  2x6=12 2x7=14 2x3=6 and 1x7=7. I almost deleted the game then, but I stuck it out and did enjoy it.
B00ANA27IU|2.0|It's not even good &#34;for its time.&#34; I'm a big sci-fi fan, and a big Clarke fan. But this story just bored me to tears. I'm not interested in getting into the nuance of the reasons for my dislike. Enough has been said both for and against this book. Just go Google it. My reasons are out there, already written by other people.
B000G73UEU|3.0|I would rate this CD five stars if it included all the wonderful songs on the DVD that are for some reason not to be found here.  Four of my six favorite renderings from the concert are not to be found here.<br />  Martha Wainwright's tender and haunting version of \\"The Traitor\\", is missing.  Also AWOL are Rufus Wainwright's version of \\"Hallelujah,\\" (definitely the best of four different versions of that song that I have).  As well as his version of \\"Chelsea Hotel\\", again fabulous in song and rendering.  And finally, a marvelous version of \\"Anthem\\" by two women who's names at the moment escape me, but who rendered it wonderfully, traded the lead effortlessly, and harmonized beautifully.  They also provided fantastic harmony singing throughout the concert for the other artists.  One's named Porta Lugio or something similar.  Anyway, four great songs left off.  I don't know if it was space issues (where they ran out of space on a single disk; or if there were contractual issues (which is usually the case).  But it's a great loss in either case.  Were the songs there, this disc would be in my most frequently played case.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|Amazing what can come from the mind of man. A man or mankind. Read this book just to see that, let alone the marvelous story.
B000001GXI|4.0|I have known this recording of Mozart's \\"Die Zauberflote\\" for more than 45 years, since I acquired it as a college undergraduate,and it has held up well over the years. My 1st and 2nd vinyl recordings deteriorated so badly over time that its advent on CD was a great moment for me. The sound has transferred beautifully, as well as any transfer I've ever encountered (and that's quite a few now.)<br /><br />The outstanding voice on the recording is Fritz Wunderlich as Tamino; this is one of the performances that bring home his early death as a terrible tragedy for the operatic world.  Franz Crass is a superlative Sarastro.  Roberta Peters' Queen of the Night is less dramatically effective than vocally; the Queen of the Night was one of the first roles she was ever hired to sing, when she was only twenty, and it seems time had taken a toll on her voice by the time this recording was made.  The idea that she's singing offkey is absurd; that her tone appears harsh may be true, but find me another soprano (apart from Nathalie Dessay) who could hold that high F in \\"O zittre nicht\\" the way Peters could.<br /><br />The recording has only 2 flaws that are worth mentioning.  The first, and perhaps most important, is that the spoken dialogue has been subjected to very deep cuts and, in many instances, rewriting.  I assume this was done to allow the recording to fit on 2 vinyl disks.  The cuts are unfortunate for one primary reason:  they do Papageno a good deal of damage, since the spoken dialogue is more important to that character than to any of the others.  As it is heard on this recording, the dialogue barely suffices to convey the story line, and that's regrettable.  (And yes, the dialogue is spoken by actors, with the exceptions of Fritz Wunderlich and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau---whose voice in the dialogue is as unmistakable as it is in the vocal passages.  The use of actors was acknowledged in the pamphlet to the original vinyl release, which is not 100% reproduced in thepamphlet to the present CD version.)  I have always very much liked the way the actresses voicing The Three Ladies overlap their scolding of Papageno as they appear just after he has taken credit for killing the serpent. Too bad that bit of business hasn't been taken over for more stage productions.<br /><br />The second problem is Evelyn Lear's Pamina.  Though she was justly renowned for her singing in 20th-century opera, I don't think her heart (or her voice) were attuned to Mozart. Her top register is constricted and forced; she is little at ease at any point in the proceedings. This is especially noticeable, and regrettable, at moments when she should sound full of confidence and determination---most unfortunately when, as Sarastro approaches at the end of the 1st Act, Pamina urges Papageno that they must tell \\"Die warheit! Die warheit!\\"  She sounds here as if she really isn't at all convinced of the wisdom of telling the truth.<br /><br />There are a few minor problems, not least of which is the decision to have adult women sing the Three Boys.  In a recording, this makes it difficult to distinguish between the Genii and the Three Ladies.  (That, of course, is not a problem in a stage production.)  With the resources of the Vienna Boys' Choir available, it's surprising that a different course was not taken.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's clear that this recording/performance has held up and continues to please, even after so many decades.  The orchestral and vocal sound is clear and crisp, and I am delighted to see that the original album art, with its stunning rendition of Papageno, appears on the cover.  (It isn't, of course, a portrait of Fiescher-Dieskau, who recorded Papageno at least twice to my knowledge, but never performed it on stage, for the simple reason that his size and bulk would have made him look ridiculous in such a costume as we see on the cover of this release.)<br /><br />Very well worth your attention, and highly recommended.
B00AZRBLHO|2.0|I found this too preachy to really be good to read.  It presents itself almost as a case study, but comes off very contrived and unrealistic in terms of people's reactions.  Characters remind me Atlas Shrugged character archetypes.
1608199096|5.0|Classic recipes. unique binding and layout make this one to tresure and certainly pass down,,,<br />You will enjoy this one if you are into the classic Italian recipes and special layout.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|The book was great! I always am waiting for the next one. Preston and Child have never failed to deliver!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I missed this show when it was on air, but always caught the opening (after DVRing what was before) - turned out that the show was just as good as I'd hoped.  Tight dialogue that's witty, characters that are fleshed out but can throw a curve, and stories that don't feel old and used by every other legal show before.
B006PKQQJS|4.0|I can get &#34;hung&#34; on certain levels. I dont like that you start over once you get beyond a certain level.<br />I like the PC version better. Sometimes when you click on a customer, they dont always move. Game should be programed for customer to move to new location b4 popup.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The plot captivated me but equally interesting was the characterization.  The realism of the couple's differing perspectives of what marriage is supposed to be added another layer of complexity.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Kind of let down by the last book of the series. Totally agree with most of the other reviews out there. Was really looking forward to this book and then was not at happy with the ending. I wasn't expecting Sookie and Eric to get together but I definately did not expect her and Sam to be together either. I was just confused through out most of the book and then it just ended weird. It all kind of left me feeling sad and not right.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I couldn't put this down.  So impressed, I bought a hard cover after reading.  Also excited that it was age appropriate for my 11 and 13 year old sons.  My 13 year old read it in one weekend.
B00CKZX0AA|5.0|The soundtrack to The Man of Steel is pretty much as epic as it gets. It is a pounding soundtrack that gives the movie a seriousness that was never present in the prior Superman films. Not that the original soundtrack from the original Superman series wasn't good. It's just that Hans Zimmer's soundtrack has a power to it that truly makes the viewer feel like he/she is witnessing some of the greatest events in history. A lot of it reminds me of Christopher Young's early work on films such as Hellbound: Hellraiser 2. Yeah, it is that dark.<br /><br />I would ignore what the film critics say as they have pretty much tried what they can to ruin the film. Even by trying to destroy what might be one of the best scores to any film in years.
B000SEGHT6|5.0|A non-stop, hard to put down kind of book! I have always liked Vonnegut' s writing style. This is right up there  with the rest!
B005LAIH2M|5.0|You have to wonder what the Brothers Grimm would say. Considering how gruesome many of their stories were, they'd probably approve of this version of a classic tale.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|very gory and violent.  I wish I would have noticed it was a Quentin Tarentino move.  that would have been 'nuf said
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game never gets boring, this game is amazing! high graphics, never ending lunch, evolve your shark, and become the shark of the sea. Definitely play this game now!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well the game is fun and all ages can play it. This is a helpful app for children's entertainment the game relies on skill the game will probably be addicting to your children
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|The cast was a lot of fun and the story was enough to keep my family interested, but the effects just missed the mark.  Too often it felt like the actors weren't a part of the scenery around them.  The worst part was that I couldn't tell if that's the \\"vibe\\" they were going for, or if the CGI was just bad.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Love the DVD set and beautiful packaging.  I love this series and have bought the entire series available.  Received set when promised.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|This book presents the sweet story of a family during the growing up of the children. It made me laugh and cry.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|These are delightful to watch. Great characters and humorous dialog abounds. Wish there were more American made shows like this to enjoy.
0805047905|5.0|My son loves this book!!! It teaches him animals as well as colors. I would recommend this book to every toddler.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I love this DVD set.  I received this set before date promised.  I now have the entire collection.  I love this series.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|These delightful, Moody, fascinating characters pull you into their world and into their minds in a way that totally makes you feel you are living in their lives. They keep you on the very edge wondering what will happen next! Had to read this trilogy over and over and they never get old. Makes you want to be them!
B0063B2BNE|5.0|These are delightful to watch. Great characters and humorous dialog abounds. Wish there were more American made shows like this to enjoy.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The best new book I have read in a long time!  Insightful, funny, intriguing!  Absolutely loved it!!! I wanted to read more of the author's books after I finished it.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|I love this DVD set.  I received the DVD set before date promised.  I love this series and can now watch over and over
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Yes it was awesome because it was so fun because I like apple pie because I like to poop and pee so much
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A great soap opera from England. Enjoyed every episode. Recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy the conniving drama of the characters who confront society, war, and an ongoing conflict with tradition in a 20th century English country estate. Fabulous cast and scenes, great music and suspense in the cliffhangers. Entertained, and can't wait for the next season.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun. Fast paced, challenging game. Just when you think you have the clues you find out you might have missed something!!!!
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Wonderful DVD series! Received the set before promised date and love the package set.  This is a great show and now have the entire series.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|this is the best book ever!<br />Like it a lot<br />Very good<br />Cool<br />Groovy<br />Real mature<br />Great<br />Never seen<br />Awesome
B001GA1RFA|5.0|I was hooked from start to finish and savored the thing in its entirety,well not the whole thing. I didn't read the appendix haha.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|Its a nice game with well designed game-play mechanics, but the levels are fairly easy overall, and acquiring every star doesn't add much challenge, because you'll end up getting most of them, by just completing the levels.  Currently there's 90 levels to play through, but each level only takes a minute or two to beat, so that roughly translates into just a few hours of actual game-play.<br /><br />The game's good for the price and can kill a few hours, but nothing spectacular.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|I saw Shinedown live for the first time in April and, while I've been a fan of theirs from the beginning, I became obsessed with them! They put on a great live show and this album is such a good mix of everything I like about them.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Its hard to figure out.  Not clear how it works or what the goal is.  Only have free version - hopefully if I pay to get the rest it would be more clear, but don't want to take the chance.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|My little girl loves this game. It's easy to teach her the colors and she can do everything herself. My wife likes this game also lol.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This is one app that allows you to move through the octaves...  It really gives you a true sound of how the keys and notes should be. :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I absolutely love it! It's fun, it's exciting, it's got you saying ''nooo!!!'' And ''yaaaaaay''. This is new and improved!!!
B006YTTVHO|4.0|This book gives good tips on improving your communication skills.  At worst it is a great refresher for those who just want to get better on a daily basis.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I enjoyed the story and Smith's diva performance along with the rest of the cast.  Recognized the actress who played &#34;Shirley Valentine&#34; (another good flick).  Seeing her in this film only broadened her acting ability in my view.  Glad that Hoffman decided to end the move with the &#34;Quartet&#34; not signing.......very wise decision.  More, more Maggie.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love this show. Can't wait for the next season. The episodes are clever, creative and well executed. One of the few shows about a law firm that comes close to reality.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|Well, I didn't always play this game but when I did, I would play for a long time. It is very fun. I like the challenges. Every time you pass that level, the next level is harder and harder. One thing I don't like though, is I thought you actually cooked the food made recipes and stuff like that.<br />I would recommend this app to all ages, even adults.
B00AQF8CJ0|3.0|It does what it says it does. That is about all I can must for this title. At least it was free.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This he is an awesome he I can't stop playing it I shared this game with 10 more people wow
B00BI73CVI|4.0|I enjoyed the movie and the music.  It was very moving. I would see it again and highly recommend it.
B0086700CM|4.0|Simple can be challenging and easier, but simple can also mean boring. Its the first temple run. Other versions are funner. If your kid says that the game is boring, get the new and improved temple run. I like it. It's addicting!
1400069807|5.0|Well researched, compelling story, very informative. The first book I've read cover to cover in a long time. A must read to people who's into healthy diet, science or marketing.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It starts fairly easily but then I was stumped for a while. The game fun &amp; challenging. I only wish it had more stages.
B003UV8TFE|5.0|Reading this book has been an adventure not only in Physics, but also into the concept of Education. I would highly recommend it to stimulate latent potential abilities among students.
B004SUWR2C|2.0|There is no point in getting this app, it is slow boring has no point waste of money sucks dont get dont get it
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Item was purchased as a gift for my husband.  He was very happy.  Neat packaging.  Project as described and shipped as promised.
B00992CF6W|5.0|IT ROCKS!  I play it all the time and the upgrade is awesome. I love the animals!!!!!!!!  This version is the best.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its good if ur trying to lose time on a plane ride or going somewhere that takes awhile to get there
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|My kids love this challenging game. They say its very fun. I don't regret getting this app. My kids play it all the time
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|It took them almost 20 years to release a worthy follow up to Promised Land but here it is folks.<br /><br />Although I just got the CD yesterday (pre-ordered from Amazon), I was able to listen to the album many times via the stream that was available online. I was very impressed by what I heard online and now, being able to listen to the album in all of its glory on CD, I am even more impressed at what this band has accomplished after so many years of disappointment. This is a short album by today's standards but it definitely delivers.<br /><br />I am looking forward with great anticipation to the next Queensryche release which is something I haven't been able to say in a long time.<br /><br />Thanks, guys.  And welcome back.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This is the top most favorite game of my kindle Fire! (Well one of them) It's a &quot;must by&quot; game!
0553801473|5.0|I don't have HBO anymore so I'm very glad I bought this book. I am looking forward to book number 6
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Works well. Use it many times daily. No complaints and no problems. I am happy with the program. Thank you
0061122416|5.0|I read this book when it first came out, and loved it.  I was in seminary at the time, and I made the book required reading in my theology and comparative religions classess. At first students weren't sure but once they started reading it, without exception, they could not put it down. Students raved about it, could identify with it, and The Alchemist made the bibilical stories come to life. It is a modern midrash, and I love it still. Since first reading it (have reread it many times since), I have also read the author's other boosk, and find him a masterful storyteller who speaks to our hearts and our spirits. Never disappointing.
0345529057|5.0|I love the descriptive language used. I read the book after watching HBO series one and two. Quite a few details are left out of the Series.
B00000ADG2|5.0|I absolutely love this album! I have listened to it straight for about 3 weeks. It got here really quick also.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag is nearly identical to the cheapest Canon brand one I was looking at buying at a camera supply store, only this one cost $40 less. Fit's my 2 Canon bodies, 4 lens's, and an attachable flash just fine. Also has a strap on the side for a tripod. I have a super lightweight one I travel with, so it works for me, but a heavier tripod would probably not hold. Also, I ordered it in the afternoon on a Tuesday, and it got to my house the next evening. Didn't even pay extra for next day shipping.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a fun and hard thinking game. I loved it<br /> I cant wait for more rooms to come out.
0385738781|3.0|First off, let me say that I really enjoyed the overall Maze Runner books, especially the first two book series. However, the third and final installment was a shear disappointment. Spoilers Lie ahead, caution. I really agree with many of the other readers reviews that the story would've been better if Thomas had received his memories. Rather we are left with the scattered memories of Thomas, rather than the whole picture, there are too many mysteries that were left hanging and unexplained for my taste. The second biggest problem of this book in my opinion is the underdevelopment of the character of Theresa.  Throughout the first two book of the series, Theresa plays a huge role, but in the third and what should be the important book to wrap up her story, Dashner instead uses her as a mere puppet figure for Thomas to be angry at for most of the book, choosing instead at the end of the book to attempt to wrap up their story. As a result Thomas/Theresa's story is both rushed and unresolved. Book 3 also does not develop the characters of the \\"group B\\". If you like action and zombies you'll really enjoy this book. If however, you were expecting more clear answers to the questions posed at the beginning of the series prepare to be let down.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|Reacher and the female protagonist spend far too much time running up and down the road and far too little time actually fighting bad guys. This seems to be Child's new modus operandi when he's too lazy to write good prose. His recent  Reacher books just aren't as good as the earlier ones. He's become a real formula writer, and in this one he's dropped the sex and still killed off the wrong characters. I'm not sure I'll read the next Reacher book.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|This is a great read it is very funny the way the kids act and I really liked the end.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|I'm a huge Batman mark but I found this installment to being a bit dry as far as anticipation, action and excitement. This should've been done better. Thank God a new director will be taking over Batman's series!
B006WQLH7G|5.0|In a world of constant vigilance, it's great to see products that help us protect our privacy and security while helping keep things as simple as possible. Great product, would use again.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|Never got to play as could not connect to internet. Wish different version had offline play and update as able. Since connection was problem for me cant rave about game.  Hope others do.
B0073U2F2Q|2.0|While I normally love even so-so Sci-fi. This movie is a little below even so-so. Strongly advise against buy DVD easy to wait for this one until it is free.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Virtual City Playground is a great game very detailed the downside is that you will have to use real money for in app purchases the complete quest ..still awesome game and a great way to kill time
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its really realistic and it makes me feel like I have a real horse! the only problem is the gems. I cant get some of the things I want on there because u only get one gem when u lvl up. :/
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of this group! And as always they did not fail to impress me or entertain me with their music!!!! This CD is by far their BEST!!!!
159448385X|4.0|Hosseini's prose is easy and I never get bogged down.  There's nothing pretentious.  As with &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; the story works on its own, in part, because of the foreign setting.  (Foreign for me, anyway.)  I thought that the author did a nice job of ending the story too which is the hardest part.  The book had a profound effect on me; I had nightmares.  How can human beings think that it is acceptable to treat other human beings with such cruelty?  It's not new, such treatment, but I can't get over it.  Thank heavens this part was not really the main story line.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I didn't know what to think of this game when I was downloading it...still not sure if I like it or not..seems a little....weird..some of the items are way to hard to find
B009NCM248|5.0|I did not know what to expect from this album when I bought it. I thought the song &#34;Absolute Zero&#34; was really damn good, but not sure about the rest. Picked it up on a whim, and holy crap, this has to be the best album of 2012. I cannot stop listening to it. Just do yourself a favor, stop reading the reviews and pick it up. You won't be sorry. Well, unless you love country music. Then you might be.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|While this was not a terrible movie, it really wasn't all that good either. I think there was a lot of potential here that just never really materialized. When making a movie that is supposed to be a prequel to one of the greatest classics of all time the bar should be set pretty high. Overall, I feel like that just put something together to cash in on The Wizard of Oz's legend instead of really building anything upon it.<br /><br />The visual effects were spectacular and in that department I have no complaints. Most of the acting was good, though I think Franco probably wasn't the best choice for Oz and at times he seemed a little wooden. The writing is another place where this movie lagged behind. It certainly has its moments and parts of it were rather enjoyable, but at times it felt somewhat disconnected. There were parts of the movie it felt like they just \\"forced\\" things into the story to keep things moving, but it just lacked creativity or believability...well, as much as a story about flying to a magical land through a tornado can be believable :). I did feel it got better toward the end, but unfortunately by that point you've had to deal with everything up to that point. Overall, I would just recommend waiting until this comes to TV instead of buying or even renting it.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|With more and more full length movies on youtube, who wouldnt want to download a few for viewing at home or on the road. Tube mate is the only product I have seen able to do that. SImple to use and it always works. I highly recommend it for any tablet device.
B0026772N8|5.0|As the book begins, &#34;This book is not primarily concerned with, or entirely accurate, with Zen or Motorcycle Maintenence&#34;.  LOL!  Having no pre-conceived notions on what the book was about, not being very Zen, and not liking motorcycles... I found this book to be very interesting.  It crosses from a light read about a motorcycle journey, into Metaphysics 101, and a basic introduction of Greek Philosophy that if I had read in 1992, I would have gotten A's in every philosophy/ sociology class I had ever taken (or really upset the teachers by finally understanding the material).  Truely an art of this book is not only in the story telling, but in the basis of thought itself.  Some of us will identify with other aspects of this book (and perhaps you will be one), that can be truely terrifying as we see our own reflection.  How so many difficult subjects fit into such a small book is astounding!
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I'm a metal fan, and like lots of genres like speed metal, black, death, etc. This album is something else. It's definitely metal, but before that, it's just good, creative music. I feel like this album can probably be enjoyed by people that aren't even metal fans, or even the most hardcore fans of that genre. It combines a lot of styles and elements from other music, and they fit seamlessly into the songs. I don't feel remiss in calling this album genius. When I buy an album, there's usually 1-2 good songs on it, and the rest feel more like \\"filler\\". I can honestly say I enjoy 90% of the songs on this album, and seem to be able to listen to the entire album, perhaps several times in a row, without tiring of it.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Talk about guilty pleasures:  Lee Child is on the top 10 for me.  This is one of the more amusing and entertaining of his mysteries, but I label them all &#34;page-turners.&#34;
B004V6X90W|3.0|I would have thoroughly enjoyed watching the story of these two men...but we couldn't finish the movie. I had to look up how it ended because the explicit content was just too much, even for this movie rating. :( Interesting story though.
B002XXNSF6|5.0|See this (and the two sequels) with someone you love. And, if you don't love anyone, go see the three movies with someone you think has potential. Very sweet, very romantic.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game.  You can solve this!  I can't wait for more rooms. Although hints are not needed, it can be a bit challenging.
B002XXPNXG|5.0|See these three movies in order with someone you love. And, if you don't love anyone, go see the three movies with someone you think has potential. Very sweet, very romantic.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I like the details in this one. You get a better idea of the back story behind the man, behind the image.
B005MLZPLQ|5.0|Unconventional casting of Ms. Mirren works incredibly well.  Atmosphere & cine work are wonderful; some special effects are less than fab, but hey - this is Shakespeare and &#34;the play's the thing.&#34;
B000VSAEYI|3.0|I bought this for my granddaughter who just turned 3.  She was thrilled, but I was less so. There are a lot of places to blow up and I had a hard time with being able to blow up the main one without a good bit of air coming back out.  I also think they needed to make the pool a little longer where the slide ends because when they come down, they hit the side wall. Still for the money it is a good deal and the kids love it!
B00CEJ2H6K|5.0|It's never, ever nice to trick the gods, fool! That being said, I've always enjoyed Amon Amarth's trusty brand of jolly and upbeat death metal that dealt with really pleasant topics such as Vikings, what food Vikings eat, how Vikings make clothes, how Vikings copulate and even the kinds of TV shows that Vikings like (hint: it's not Wipeout).<br /><br />This CD is really awesome because the songs really get you up from your seat and will have you dancing along to the sweetest pop tunes with more effortlessness than the newest Katy Perry CD or the sweetest Kidz Bop 132 offering! When you talk about sweet metal offerings, then you really have to have a CD where you can dance your buns off. I'm a hardcore metal fan, so this is the truth, and don't argue with me, okay? Okay!<br /><br />It's amazing how truly original Amon Amorth has been. Songs like As Loke Falls just repeat their already worn-out Viking obsession for something like the thousandth time in their career! This makes me think that this band is highly original because they keep coming up with such unprecedented song topics, miha! Yes...in a world of extremely unoriginal bands like Black Sabbath and Metallica, we need true metal originality like this band provides.<br /><br />Songs like Snake Eyes sing about Vikings coming to eat dinner while songs like Stand Up to Go Down celebrate the Vikings going to Sizzler to order some shrimp scampi. In short, this band can do no wrong with its amazingly original brand of death metal...of awesomeness.<br /><br />So go ahead and purchase this CD right now from Amazon. I give you my personal Gilby Guarantee that you won't walk away disappointed like that Edward Snowden guy who exposed Obama for s/p/y/i/n/g on fellow Americans through the NSA. This CD rocks like nothing before it (except, maybe, the Jonas Brothers)!
074401493X|5.0|This guide is nice. I kind of collect hardcover guides, and this ones very nice. It's also full of content and comes with a really nice keychain. It's worth the price. Much better than a paperback.
0451450523|5.0|This book did not disappoint. I loved the movie as a child and bought it, and I thought I might as well read the book so I bought it and I was so glad I did. I didn't want to stop reading. Beautifully written and it's a wonderful story with colorful characters and a great plot.
B00004WQ3A|5.0|I almost cried when I opened it...not really, but it is beautiful. So well crafted. The electronic tracks sound superb on vinyl as do the tracks with more guitar and bass. Drums sound perfect! PERFECT!!! The song I feel that benefits the most from being on vinyl is the becoming and big man with a gun.
B00D02Z1EA|5.0|I think every ABR album has been fantastic, but this album is really something else! I've had it on repeat all day. I love the musical and melodic growth in the band over the past few years. ABR is truly peerless in the metalcore genre. Good job guys!
B009NT4D8E|5.0|Great and speedy delivery. Exactly what I wanted. Just a little upset I had to pay for a bluray 3d dvd to get it.
B00BU18U82|5.0|He likes all the farming equipment.  He has been learning about the joy and the difficulties of planting a crop.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Got the sense the universe wanted me to read this book because it kept showing up in my life even when I tried to ignore it.....so glad I did! Awesome book by a really talented writer.
B000QGEB12|5.0|This movie is hilarious. It is refreshing to see a kung fu movie with lots of humor!!! It's a must see...
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like it but when will there be boats and minecarts and railroad tracks?cause It takes forever to move around I like dating people on realms
B00CWY76CC|5.0|a little hard but after awhile it was easy just click around and you'll find stuff! I love it a lot!
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Great for all ages!! I love this movie. I showed it to my Kindergarten class after our Sea Animal Unit....it was a fun way to close that study unit.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|On a couple of levels, the game was unresponsive when tapped a specific area of the room. However, I really enjoyed this game. Very challenging sometimes. Finding the clues were fun.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Yes, this is the much anticipated and ballyhooed second 'Queensryche' album of 2013, and from a distance one may think this is another manifestation of the same 'Beach Boys' syndrome that produces sightings of a fragmented band under the same name at places like Casinos and County Fairs. After all, the metal 80's was a lifetime ago and reprising the hits of yesteryear for middle-aged rockers hungry for the angst, the revelry and in this case the mystery was and is money in the bank, right? Truthfully the perceptions end with those trite and shallow words indeed. I'm one of 'those' fans from 30 years hence, one who has allowed the musical bar to be dropped in the name of being a 'progressive' outfit and an open mind. When the band, in its 'collective' mode produced 2009's 'American Solider' I was resigned to the fact that this was the best the band could sound given their age and increasingly divergent musical passions. In my review I was citing it as Swan Song-especially given that their frontman had reached vocal exhaustion. Two years later, I handled the overly experimental 'Dedicated To Chaos' like a china heirloom, pieced together hastily by an elderly relative but nonetheless a vestige of a dying soul. That heirloom was ultimately shattered,with the pieces collected in a frenetic effort to salvage a musical identity and heritage. Although the shards and splinters seemed to indicate an irreparable state, there is..<br /><br />Rebirth.<br /><br />At first glance and listening of the opening 'X2' it would be understandable to assume that the triumvirate of original members of Queensryche were hunting for old tricks and riffs to show their fanbase that the shackles-breaking drama of 2012 was indeed justified. Even treading into 'Where Dreams Go To Die' bolsters that assumption, with riffs and chorus that echo 1988 in grand fashion. Alas, this is not an album that follows the old formula of racing out of the gate like so many in the past. This production, indeed well-deserving of carrying the very name of the band as its title, ebbs and flows with a sheer power and purity that leave no doubt that THIS is the band known as Queensryche. 'Spore' begins the assault, registering sonically along the lines of 'Warning', with a smattering of RFO thrown in for good measure. 'Redemption', 'Fallout' (yes, the riff seems strangely similar to 'New Millennium' by Dream Theater) and 'In this light' should resonate very well with fans who came to know this band via 'Empire'; new lead vox Todd LaTorre probably channels Geoff Tate the most here. Other tracks will squelch any notion that he's just a fill-in on the merits of his registers being close to Mr. Tate in his prime. No, any listen to recent Crimson Glory with him at the helm should put that to rest as well. 'Vindication' and 'Don't Look Back' are slightly chaotic but venture into the realm of a true metal sound typical of their first two releases. Finally, 'A World Without' and 'Open Road' demonstrate that the core members were able to reach deep within themselves and find a passion, fervor, creativity and skill that had been suppressed for so long. Simply put, these are two of the finest tracks this band has produced in 25 years. Period. Both echo the progressive darkness that made Rage For Order arguably their finest album. Thoughtful analysis aside, taking in this atypically short (35 minutes) release was like looking at a very well preserved time capsule, one that made this fan flush with not just nostalgic bliss but breathe deep with hope. Bravo, Queensryche and Mr. Barton. Bravo.<br /><br />Once listened through 'Queensryche' signifies the new mentality of what this band has come to embrace, and that is a holistic approach to thoughtful and skillful hard rock. No bombastic lyrical tirades, no hired guns, no rush-to-market pseudo business acumen. You can find those in the earlier release under a different guise with the same name. There will be no question come November. What's missing? Listen and find out.<br /><br />If you're a fan of this band from any era, Take Hold. Now.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series is wonderfully written, has great acting, and beautiful cinematography. Several people talked me into watching and I was hooked at the pilot. Seeing the interactions among the aristocracy as the reality of the precariousness of their position becomes apparent and they have to ll with harsh reality shows their humanity. The stories among the servants brings them to life. It's complex and completely engaging. I can't speak to how realistic it is, not being around during that time, but it seems the producers have made efforts to make it as realistic as possible. Downton Abbey is a real gem.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|it is very fun and cool it is the best zoo game ever and dinosaurs wow i cant believe u come up with this stuff
B0091WNK8M|4.0|Watched this with my kids, they enjoyed it as much as I did when I was their age.  Picture quality was great.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Found out about it because they'd irked the pilot episode on. Able the other night. I was thrilled to find  this on AmazonPrime so that I could catch up with the season before the next one starts.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book keep you interested in what's going to happen next. You just want to keep reading and by the time you know the book is finish. It a great book. Very detailed.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|I enjoy the Jesse Stone movies very much and Tom Selleck is perfect playing Jesse Stone.  I like the prequel even better than the first movie.  I don't want to give too much away but if you love animals or have a pet you will relate to Boomer, Jesse's dog.<br /><br />I personally like that the movie wraps everything up tight at the end, as I think getting to know Jesse Stone is the point of the whole movie anyway.<br /><br />I look forward to watching the rest of the Jesse Stone movies.  So far, I find these to be hidden, understated movie gems!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love the fifty shades trilogy. I read all the book in 3 days. It was a very awesome book.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|As an Italian American (on my Mom's side), I grew up watching these movies, can say that I own all three & saw The Godfather lll in the theaters. I have just now gotten around to reading the book that started it all. WOW!!! I am an avid reader and this book exceeded all expectations! It has become an instant favorite! It is so well written and believable that it draws you in from the start. If you have seen the movies, read the book!!! It is better thatn the movies and I was pretty sure that wasn't going to be possible. You learn more about some of the characters that are just touched upon in the movie and it makes you look at the movie in a whole new way. Love It!!!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|The book is amazing, just as good as it's prequel. I can't wait for the next one to come out!
B000005RQT|3.0|I love this band.  Rock concerts, road trips, LSD and 8 track tapes--this album was a big part of my program back in the day.'Into the Fire' and 'Child in Time' are both masterpieces that I hope never to grow too old to appreciate.  There is, however, a great deal of musical trivia on this CD.  I guess things needed to be added to make it an \\"anniversary edition,\\" but the original playlist of the vinyl record must have been selected for a purpose that also excluded some of the internal noodling of band members.  Who wants to pay for idle chords and chatter?  For that reason, and that reason only, the compilation gets 3 stars.  The music is spectacular.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|This was a fast and engrossing read. Not sure the teen characterization and witty dialogue range true 100%. But still worth it.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I won't write too much, since many more reviews will come and mine will be drowned out. To keep it short and to the point, this album represents the true Queensryche sound had they not experimented with their music from 1996 - 2003. I mention that range of dates because I personally felt that OM2 and American Soldier briefly returned to their classic sound (sort of). This album packs a punch for a 35-minute production! The tone is angry, dark, no-nonsense, yet with hints of that gothic mystique that characterized Rage For Order, Operation Mindcrime, Empire and Promised Land. I sincerely hope that the trio of original members succeed in the November court case so that this fine album may once and for all be officially recognized as part of the authentic Queensryche album canon, and have that other piece of garbage with the stupid fist cover discontinued.<br /><br />Okay, not as short as I said it would be, but I still made my point.
0307346617|5.0|Much better than the movie, and different too. I bought the book 2 weeks before the movie came out, and it was hard to put down. Well written, descriptive, and edited for many different reading levels. Definitely worth the read.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Really really cute movie! Really want my husband to watch it next. Love the free streaming movies with Prime. Must see movie.
B004GJ1XU2|5.0|Great flick and great music. A snapshot of life for a group of college friends. It was filmed in Beaufort SC.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|After listening to the whole album for the first time, one thing is clear as crystal: Queensrÿche should have fired Geoff Tate a long time ago. Although I like some pieces of the music released in the past 15 years, the band wasn't Queensrÿche. Actually, it wasn't a band at all, but a Geoff Tate solo project.<br /><br />Now we have a band on fire, writting its music without lame outside writters. Now we have a real producer back on the fold (James \\"Jimbo\\" Barton), and the most important factor: three of the four founding members are really enjoying what they are doing. Michael Wilton, Scott Rockenfield and Eddie Jackson are playing their asses off! It's great to hear that bass tone from EdBass (listen to \\"Redemption\\"), great to hear a really happy Whip shredding again (\\"Fallout\\", for example), and drummer extraordinaire SRock is hitting the skins like a beast (his work on \\"Vindication\\" is insane!).<br /><br />And it's funny to remember that Geoff Tate said he doesn't know what the Queensrÿche signature sound is, but guitarrist Parker Lundgren, a talented young kid that has been in the band for the past five years, knows exactly what it is. Man, \\"Where Dreams Go to Die\\" is epic, and has Queensrÿche written all over it.<br /><br />There are no fillers on the record, and some songs are so awesome that I can bet they are going to be classics: \\"In This Light\\", \\"A World Without\\" and \\"Open Road\\" are killer songs, and you can bang your head with \\"Spore\\", \\"Don't Look Back\\" and \\"Fallout\\". And last but definetely not the least, the real fans now have Todd La Torre, an amazing singer and a really great guy - also, a musician that can actually writes music. He's not only a lyricist like Geoff Tate is. Thank God Todd stepped in!<br /><br />If you missed the Queensrÿche from \\"Rage for Order\\", \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\" and \\"Empire\\", with something from \\"Promised Land\\" in it, I mean, that sophisticated metal band we all grew up loving, now you have that band back!<br /><br />\\"Queensrÿche\\" is not only the best Queensÿche record in the last 19 years (since \\"Promised Land\\"), it's a true Queensrÿche record. Now it's a great time to be a Queensrÿche fan! Go listen to the new record. I'm sure you're gonna love it.
B00BV1P8NG|5.0|My wife bought this for her brother; Derpy came fast & she was in perfect condition. Derpy goes great his Doctor Whooves! May have smelt like plastic, but mostly all Funko/plastic figurines are like that till they can breathe out of the box. :) My wife has Fluttershy. Will definitely refer to this seller!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I like the game a lot and could play it without trouble but for some reason today it keeps crashing or not loading at all just a black screen. Any ideas out there?
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Jesus said we would never know for sure in this life so his experience isn't proof but it is good reading.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It is extremely addictive game. Love that it is not slots, there the challenges for daily bingo as well as collection bongos. Graphics are great as well.
0670014893|2.0|I usually like le Carre but this book was difficult to follow. I did not care for it. I do not recommend it.
B008ENNXQI|3.0|As my title says, just not a memorable movie to me.<br />It was ok, but I wouldn't watch it again.
B00181MHQU|1.0|Rented this on Amazon Instant Video.  We've used instant video before, with no issues (audio or video), but this was very disappointing.  The audio was not in sync with the video.  The video itself was choppy in places.  The music sections have more popping and crackling than an old vinyl LP.  We stopped it, and restarted again at a different time of day... no improvement, although we had &#34;excellent&#34; connectivity according to Amazon - it was not our internet connection.<br /><br />Sadly, I cannot recommend it at all.  I'll try to find a better copy of the movie, but I am not hopeful, based on other reviews.
0316153907|5.0|It was a very good read.  I really did not see the ending coming.  Well written and enjoyed very much.  Will read more of his books.
0060899220|4.0|Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain is an irreverent and often funny discourse on the author's experience coming up in the somewhat cutthroat world of the restaurant business. This warts-and-all tale comes across well with Bourdain's easygoing conversational prose that makes the reader almost feel that they're listening to the affable author share some secrets and war stories over a cup of coffee and pack of cigarettes. Bourdain's honesty in mentioning his drug use and abuse, as well as his discussions of common kitchen practices that just have to be deemed unsanitary, add to the sense that you're being let in on some illicit material. Perhaps this is just because I've been enduring less than stellar prison cuisine and conditions for too many years, but I found Bourdain's enthusiasm for food to be infectious - especially trying some new things as he traveled to Japan. It made me long for those opportunities, and ultimately it made me laugh.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read all 3 books in less than a week! James definitely leaves the reader with a sense of satisfaction! Best read in a long time! Loved the book and loved rediscovering my own Christian grey in my husband!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Easy change.  I use it for SS and switch between versions.  Works really well- and the price is right! Great!
B0063IH60K|4.0|When I can't keep my interest on tv or any other chore I go to this game to keep my mind busy.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Too many interruptions for a kid to play, but kills time when i am waiting in an airport or something.  Not sure what the point is other than accumulate points.
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|Could be better. I payed for it so I would wish that you could share videos to YouTube. But I still do like it, it's an ok app.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|Discovered I couldn't play it, even though it let me download it... do not like, quite frankly. I feel like they need to make the download requirements more clear.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|Tells me hope much percentage is left in my battery, as well as how much time is remaining. Although it is a bit inaccurate. One star less until it's fixed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game I love all animals but I love to play this game when I'm alone or in bed it is very addicting
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is a well written and acted movie.  I like the two main actresses, Judi Dench and  Maggie Smith, they are always a pleasure to watch.  The story line reflects with humor,  how difficult it is, especially at an older age, to make life changes.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Now while mobile gaming will never replace console gaming due to hardware limitations, the Dungeon . Hunter series makes an excellent stab at it. I've had a lot of fun with this game and though some complain about the game being&quot;freemium&quot; I personally don't mind so much. The game is completely playable without spending a single cent, in fact it adds an extra layer of challenge to see how far you can get without paying any money. The in game transactions are there for the less patient gamer with disposable income. Free to pay games with in game transactions are the video game industry's way of combating piracy, they're trying to adapt to the changing market so don't be so angry about it. Any way, stepping off my soapbox, Dungeon Hunter 4 is a very fun dungeon crawler RPG that at the beautiful price of free is a must try.cc
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|The story is about retired musicians and, four Opera singers who live in a lovely old mansion, that is now a retirement home.  It is alive with music and humor!  I have never cared about Opera singing per say, but that is not the focus here.  The film is full of music performed by the residents, who are very talented retired musicians.  It is lovely to watch.  The &#34;extra&#34; footage is a bonus!
B00A6RCSKC|4.0|I really like the game on iPhone, but it's even better on my Kindle 's larger screen. Pretty much impossible to beat the game without making in-game purchases (especially on hard), which seems a bit shady for a paid app, but oh well. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys tower defense games. I hope they bring the new Frontier version to Android as well. I've beat it multiple times on iPhone and it is STILL fun.<br /><br />NOTE: I bought this on my Kindle Fire HD but wanted it on my Fire (non HD) and apparently it is not supported on the non HD Fire. Didn't see that mentioned anywhere...
B004LWZWBU|5.0|I have always loved Steve Martin's performances and he is great here!  Jack Black and Owen Wilson handle the subject with humor and are believable birders also.  It is a fun but not silly movie, and great for anyone who loves birds, whether you are a birder or not.<br /> The birds that are discussed are authentic,  but some are unlikely to extremely rare.  In the 43 years my husband and I have been birding, our life list is 186 birds.  The &#34;Big Year&#34; for the characters are over 700 for one year.  That takes a lot of time and travel to manage, which is the point of how much of a competition it would actually be!  I love how the story explains that birders do not cheat!  It is against the game to cheat!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am eagerly awaiting more levels. I was surprised there was only 10 levels. Loved that it was engaging and not easily solved - this way it didn't end too quickly.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Great book for the exploratory mind and a genuine source of quick, \\"pick me up\\" quotes for stumped scientists. Enjoy.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|This will go down as an all time favorite for anyone who likes De Niro and Joe P. as well as Ray L. the entire cast was perfect for this movie. The storyline never loses ground; the fact that its based on a true story is even more enlightening. But it does give you a very realistic view of gangland at its best. The period is very convincing except for one noticeable mistake which I caught, and I really hate that about myself; I always find little things that don't go in the movie. For this one, was the scene where they went from Ray's childhood to his adulthood that was supposed to be 1963 as an introduction, Ray looks to cool dressed in a grey shark skin suit with his foot on the bumper of a 1965 chev. Only thing I saw that I could not help but notice. Over all the film kills....
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I wish there was a no star button. its just thatt bad. I reccomed not getting it :/ just don't get it. its just a waste of time.!!?!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|After seeing this movie through the redbox rental I knew I just had to have it. And because it is Blu-ray it is an even bigger bonus. This movie rocks!!!! It is a must see for the Alien series fan. No Ms. Weaver doesn't star in it, but it does put things into perspective as to the Alien movies origin.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Just when you thought it couldn't get any better it does. The love story grows, its extremely adorable and the intimate moments are also great.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I saw the movie first, so I could not wait to read the book. The movie was awesome, the book just enhanced that experience. You won't be able to put it down. It is an awe inspiring love story. It will warm your heart for what true love can be.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Passionate, sexy, and most of all a great love story. Its very detail on the intimate parts which make you fill right in the story .
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|It definitely is a fun game and it challenges my mind sometimes because I have to do so much at one time! It's helping with my eye hand coordination in a way :)
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is very similar to fifty shades of Grey but it has a love story of its own, and what a great story it is. Eva with all her self esteem issues is a better character than Anastasia, Gideom is similar to Christian but at the same time different. The Love story in this book is unbelievable and the intimate moments are soooo dam hot. I LOVE THIS BOOK
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|I was extremely disappointed in this movie. I am a big fan of the Oz series of books and the Maguire series as well. This story was as predictable as it was boring. And the acting is some of the worst I've seen. I don't know why anyone casts James Franco any more and Mila Kunis has done much better work. I'm also a little disturbed by the borderline racist tone of parts of the show. All in all, one to give a wide berth.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Its was so sad when I finish this book. It left me wanting more. The book has a beautiful ending and you'll just want more and more.
B00884GR0W|4.0|The graphics are better than Minecraft or Survivalcraft and look similar to some mid to late 90's computer games. It ran a little jerky on my Nexus 7. I will let my kids run wild on it and see how they like it.
B003F1WM2K|5.0|Well written.  Wonderful snapshot of their lives and hearts.  I appreciated her sensitivity and self-reflection.  She is a very thoughtful person and it is reflected in the reverence with which she presents this special person to us.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I've had this for a few months now and haven't had a problem with it at all, well worth the buy.
B004X4QW42|5.0|If your a fan of Bruce Lee and Wing-Jung you'll love this movie<br />Action and Drama all in one<br />Nicely done where you don't even have to be a fan of martial arts to enjoy
B008B92U32|5.0|I downloaded this on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and have had some funny results when swapping my face with the face of my kids. I don't know if this could be used often as it loses some of the initial fun but use it every so often and you'll have fun with friends and family.
B005NQ5LQ4|5.0|If your a fan of Bruce Lee and Wing-Jung you'll love this movie<br />Action and Drama all in one<br />Nicely done where you don't even have to be a fan of martial arts to enjoy
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|I like this app on my Samsung Galaxy Note II to access my Windows 7 Desktop. It takes a little getting used to the controls but once you figure out how you like it set up you'll be working with it quickly. I haven't tried access over the mobile network and have only used it on my home network so I can't speak for mobile network use.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|this is such a GREAT app.  easy to use and adds so much to my kindle. thanks for creating it
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Each tract of this CD is fresh, original, and has meaning. Phillips is artistic with the music and lyrics. I am very satisfied with this purchase.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This should be in any collection if you want excellent drama.  I encourae you to always by the original UK edition, it is the best available.
B009PNQUXO|3.0|I have this but I really don't know why?? I think I was trying to watch a video on you tube.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I am amazed at how much I learned from this book. I have put into practice what I learned in my new relationship, so far so good. I also realized the things I did wrong in my prior relationships.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B0031RS64G|5.0|I was introduced to the Malazan Empire when reading the book \\"Re-reading A GAME OF THRONES: An Unauthorized Response to George R. R. Martin's Fantasy Classic by Remy J. Verhoeve (Apr 17, 2011)\\" available at Amazon.<br />The author Remy (a.k.a. Slynt) mentioned that a few books had the same scope as ASOFAI books, and the Malazan saga was one of them.  So I had to check it out, because after reading all the books from A Song of Fire and Ice, I wanted more!<br /><br />If you got confused with all the houses in Westeros, prepare to put on your thinking cap to read Gardens of the Moon.  I think I never resorted so much to the search function of my Kindle, which is kind of a must have to read these books, so much you will be going back and forth to make all the connections about what's happening.  And when you realize you caught some of the (many) connections within the book, it's a great moment.<br /><br />But it all fits together, even in the very first book where we get plunged right into action.  I have seen some people complain that the first book is hard to follow because of the little exposition on the background information about the peoples, gods, warrens in the book; but my opinion is that what you need to understand (and greatly enjoy) the book is there.  And in the next books things get much clearer anyway, so there is a very high re-read value in this first book.<br /><br />But it is not an easy read at all.<br />Still, highly recommended!  You will not regret it!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I wasnt sure i would like this book but it was awesome... the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars was because of the ending. Like Hazel, I need to know what happens!!!  Other than that it was great, I fell in love with the characters and the story was believable!
0307730697|4.0|I enjoy reading Navy Seal books and their stories - this is a great story and worth reading. Not your traditional seal book which was interesting.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed The Innocent and The Hit.  Read both books in 4 days.  It was very hard to put them down.  I enjoy thrillers/mysteries and have read about 60 books since my wife gave me my Kindel.  Baldacci's books are in my top 5.  Good characters, action and story.  I look forward to reading many, many more of his works!
0061655554|5.0|very interesting to read the story of one of the largest LBO done in history.<br />Great story and some interesting insight into kkr - check out the stock :) (KFN for distress debt)
B006LSZECO|5.0|Makes you think about what some people are capable of.  The deviant mind can be so manipulative and cunning.  Fear is the theme of this book.
1400067820|2.0|I read a bunch of business books and this one just didn't grab my attention and interest at all - maybe it was just me but I gave it a few tries and put it down.
B005AKFXZW|4.0|Just finished the book which was original and exotic. Really enjoyed the story. If you like to use your imagination then I'd recommend.
0525953728|5.0|I know this book has gotten a lot of press - it's interesting to hear the story from &#34;Marks&#34; point of view and from how the seals prepared. Worth the read for sure.
0316223239|2.0|I was intrigued by the storyline but thoroughly unimpressed with what the author did with it.  The 5 year old narrator's language was unbelievable.  I am around a lot of 5 year olds and this kid's use of language was way off!  The story dragged on and you only got snippets about the shock the Jack, the narrator must have felt given his life experience.  It didn't really delve too deeply into the psychology but just stuck to way too many little life details.  Not impressed;  probably won't read anything else by this author.
0062082353|5.0|Great book - interesting to read this story as it has inserts from his wife which is good to hear how much the family sacrificed - most in the armed forces do. Great book
B00451VH84|1.0|In order to view this DVD, I have to alter my computer's settings to a different &#34;region&#34; - Europe.  Once I do that I can only do it again 3 more times in the life of my computer.  My DVD player will not read the DVD either.  Nothing in the description of the item indicated this product could not be used in the United States.  Very frustrated at wasting $30.
B005D4YOSW|5.0|If you have never owned a pair of these, stop what you are doing and order them now! You will love them.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I was very worried this would not be a good book to read since so many other individuals didn't like it although like always I loved it. I wish there were more books to read by Nicholas Sparks but unfortunately I have read all of his books.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I enjoyed the humor in the Colonel's book about life and where it is going. It is a pretty quick read will some good laughs. I will work on the Daily Practice to choose myself. Oh, the answer is Sally Field.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Perhaps you aren't a believer in self help books or religion but storytelling has always held a place in this world and puts things into a perspective that you can understand on an individual level. Before you begin, ask your heart a question and by the end it will be answered and you will be wiser. We all have a personal legend.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|the game is good. the simple controls work for this style of game and the graphics are pretty good too
B009NY43NY|2.0|After reading all her books and going on this exciting journey with Sookie I can't believe it's over. I personally wasn't that thrilled for how it played out !!spoiler alert!!!  Very unhappy how. The author pushed Eric and Pam out of the picture esp with everything they have been through. The author was just like see you guys u all have new lives that don't involve each other. As for Sookie<br />ending up with Sam I always thought of them as brother and sister/real good friends NOT ENDING UP TOGETHER! That's just not the right ending for me. We spent the majority of this series on the love sookie and Eric.even after giving it some thought I know,even if I really really don't like, that sookie and eric could not have ended up together. I want a series on eric now if you are kust going to rip him away from us like that. Can u tell I loved eric! But go pam for being new sheriff. She will be harsher maybe then eric.
B00C061I3K|5.0|This is a great album. It has a bit of an acquired taste as Daft Punk has channelled a diverse set of genres and masterfully blended them into something that is truly refreshing.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|This is the first golf range finder I have purchased. It is very user friendly, just push the button and pin point the object you want the distance within the circle.  It has improved my golf game not only shooting at the pin, but on Par 5's with fairway bunkers.  I would recommend this over any GPS unit.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I love this movie. Not to mention, it took me forever to finally see it. I saw numerous movie posters and never thought to give it a try. Then randomly, my friend had ordered the movie on tv, and I fell in love. This product was ordered for that friend for his birthday, on blu ray, and he loved it.
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|I honestly can't tell you much at all about this movie as it literally put me to sleep after about 25  minutes.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|It took me long enough to see this movie, and don't you know, the day I was watching it, I instantly ordered the cd on amazon. Had to. Thanks!
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|A very decent flick. Typical Tom Cruise......good story line coupled with action. I'm not sorry that I purchased this DVD.
1781162646|4.0|This is a very touching story..  Not horror nor is it much of a 'Mickey Spilane' crime mystery.  But....  It is a perfect blend of character driven & plot driven..  Also brilliantly rendered prose.<br /><br />King, is a Master.
B00AZNEW5G|3.0|Long and drawn out....even the Bin-Laden raid was mostly in the dark. If your looking for action, this isn't it.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|I tried this on the computer, and I was highly impressed by it. But the Kindle Fire Edition.... it takes the game a step further. And for the naysayers, the game IS possible on hard without paying, but it took me forever. All in all, I would suggest this to any casual gamer or Tower Defense fan.<br /><br />  5/5 stars
B009O5CLZY|1.0|I love the game but it won't load. It keeps on getting stuck on the menu. I am sick of it!
B0058YPILY|5.0|Criminal Minds is my favourite tv show. I really enjoyed being able to view season 7 again.<br />I will be looking forward to ordering season 8 shortly.
B00CFA225Y|2.0|The disk does not have a picture of Jack and the Giant, the case did not have a seal, only plastic wrap. I think this might be a copy from the original, most copyies don't have the luster and 3D image as the original. P/S I have not watched the movie yet.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|I've heard some scuffle over Daft Punk's new album being &#34;too danceable&#34; and all I can say is, HECK YEAH! If you don't like it, shut up and sit down! There is still plenty for you to enjoy here!<br /><br />As a music artist myself, I know how confining it can be to be squeezed into the box people want you to stay in but props to Daft Punk for following their hearts and daring to explore beyond the confines of &#34;expectation!&#34;<br /><br />Here there is the usual gorgeous production quality and sensational use of rhythm and sound separation all the while harkening back to a more hedonistic time when all we wanted to do was dance and have a good time. Why? Because WE COULD! Dance, that is.<br /><br />I always have a great respect for contemporary artists who pay homage to the greats who have paved the way and, let's face it, Giorgio Moroder is the Granddaddy of Techno Pop. Giorgio By Moroder is AWESOME! The inclusion of Nile Rodgers was also a stroke of retro-genious! One hears that craftily, slightly &#34;behind the beat&#34; snare and that reverberating rhythm guitar and you KNOW who it is, from Good Times to Like A Virgin to Let's Dance it is Nile Rodgers!<br /><br />Thanks Daft Punk! Gotta get back and listen AGAIN!
B000FC1MCS|3.0|Once I knew who killed the dog, the hero of the story started to get on my nerves and the book with its narrative style quickly got really annoying (thankfully, it's short). Well I guess it was the point, so I could see what life is about for those people and how that affects the ones around them and how hard it is to care. And it's the book about love and selfishness and chaos in our lives that we learn to ignore or cope with, and in the end it's a good book cause it's red and I like red. And now as an appendix to my review i'm gonna solve some random quadratic equation..
1935597760|5.0|This is an intriguing tale of an Irish caricature named Jamie McCloone, colorfully painted with words, descriptions, and the clever usage of old Irish dialect. Furthermore, this is the heartbreaking story of this man who subconsciously desires to overcome the dark past of his orphanhood and goes in search of someone who will help him overcome this oppressive heartache.<br /><br />In the beginning, the grown Jamie McCloone is resigned to a life of miserable loneliness while living on a rural farm he's recently inherited from his family in Ireland. But some hope remains for Jamie when a respected family friend stops by his farm \\"one fine class of a morning\\" to offer some good advice -- that he should need a wife and that he could find one in the personal want-ads in the local newspaper. \\"Och now, nobody would look at the like of me!\\" Jamie says, when his friend makes the suggestion, but his friend's wife goes on to encourage Jamie, who later, capitulates and writes an ad with further assistance and encouragement from her . . .<br /><br />Thus, the book entails a rich contrast of Jamie's rugged rural life and the woman he eventually meets, Lydia Devine, and her cultured city life of cleanliness and refinement. \\"The Misremembered Man\\" is the story of two opposites. One of the disheveled Jamie and one of Lydia who lives under an oppressive mother and the moral compass instilled in her by her deceased father. They meet and an intriguing romance begins to bud in this touching story of companionship set in rural Ireland's darker times. The story holds both tragedy and humor, family love and the cold hearted cruelties suffered by children in earlier English orphanages.  The reader senses a predictable ending but this story has twists and turns and unexpected moments that are both surprising and conclusive. What a sad life he has until he finally finds happiness. This is a good book for those seeking a heart warming story in a period setting. Recommended. Courtney Allen
B009J2VQSK|2.0|Shame on me.  I tried hard to find the songs on this before I bought it.  I couldn't find them and in good faith just purchased the music CD.  It only had one of the songs I wanted and my favorites excluded.  Not feeling warm and fuzzy over this purchase.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Man i couldn't wait to run out and buy this Album as soon as it was released. This is the most excited i have been about going out and purchasing an Album since Symphony X,s Iconoclast Album that came out 2 years ago.<br /><br />This is a true Reinvigeration of the band. This is classic Queensryche right here. The songs on here are Powerful, Dynamic, And Intense. This is the Queensryche that you grew up with, This is the Queensryche that you love. And the band is making a statement on this Record saying we are back and thanks for being patient with us.<br /><br />The Album itself is short in length. it clocks in at around 35 Minutes, But the songs are Excellent and the flow is Superb.<br /><br />Standout tracks on here are Where Dreams go to Die, Redemption, And Fallout.<br /><br />Queensryche are back. Thank God. This is a Fantastic Album.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like my horse app it is fun but I wish there was more to do. I really recommend this app for anyone who likes animals.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|This is a record that comes with a lot of baggage. Its sort of a difficult record to talk about without mentioning all the behind-the-scenes events that surrounded its creation and release. How do you even describe it? Is it Queensrÿche's twelfth or thirteenth full-length studio album (discounting covers-albums)? I mean, some people would say its not even a Queensrÿche album at all yet, until a court case is settled.<br /><br />I'm sure most people reading this will be familiar with the album's back-story, but for those who aren't, I'll add a quick overview. Queensrÿche started out in the early eighties as a fairly heavy, slightly progressive Metal band from Seattle with a melodic commercial sheen. Their singer Geoff Tate was one of the most immensely talented vocalists in the genre and influenced many Power Metal and Progressive Metal singers over the years. For about a decade the band released a string of seminal records that never sounded anything like what the band had did before, save for the identifiable `feel' of the musicians involved and the general attitude of being a bit clever, without being bloated or pretentious. The band were all about evolution.<br /><br />In the mid-nineties and onwards the general fan reaction was that the experiments and changes weren't as exciting, and the band released a few albums that lost them a lot of fans, especially after the brilliant Chris DeGarmo left the band. After this Geoff and his family allegedly slowly took over the band, working with outside writers and session musicians, doing things fans found distasteful and releasing a few very unpopular records, as a lot of fans no-longer approved of the bands spirit of evolution, or indeed felt that their music had become ironically generic. There were also allegations that Geoff spat at fellow band members, threatened them, possibly with a knife, and there is video documentation online of him insulting his own audience. This sort of behaviour caused a lot of fans to lose interest in Geoff and become openly hostile towards him. A lot of people had slowly forgotten about Queensrÿche after the nineties and now they were reminded of them, but in the least opportune way.<br /><br />The rest of the band eventually started a side project called Rising West, passionately playing the material from Queensrÿche's more popular first decade or so, with a new singer called Todd La Torre, who had previously been working with Crimson Glory, a band who's early work was a bit similar to Queensrÿche's early work. He had a voice very suited to covering Queensrÿche songs. Eventually this band just decided to call themselves Queensrÿche and so ousted Tate from the band causing a lot of fuss online and in the press. They recorded this album, which they have simply entitled Queensrÿche. It was produced by Jim Barton who had worked as Mixer and Engineer on two of the fan's favourite Queensrÿche albums: Operation Mindcrime and Empire, as well as co-producing the superb, moody and progressive Promised Land album.<br /><br />Geoff however also made an album under the name of Queensrÿche with associates, friends and contempories from the Thrash and Glam Metal scene as well as numerous guest appearances, and managed to release it first. Its bonus tracks featured re-recorded updates of songs from Operation Mindcrime and Empire that were the source of considerable criticism online. In fact the whole record received something of a critical attack. There is now a controversial and often hostile split between a vocal minority of fans of each version of Queensrÿche, and as such each of these two records are controversial, and there are people who are going to hate both of them no matter what they actually sound like. Just remember Guns N Roses' Chinese Democracy album; people couldn't wait to call it a disappointment due to the circumstances that surrounded its creation and release. It seems now that both versions of Queensrÿche have found themselves in that same unpleasant situation, by fans who have either \\"taken a side\\" or indeed taken a dislike of Queensrÿche altogether, and disapprove of their overhyped difficulties and very public feud.<br /><br />In fact, although it is certainly very strong at the moment, this isn't really all that new a position that the band have found themselves in; people have been queing up to hate new Queensrÿche albums ever since Chris DeGarmo left, and just because this album has a different singer, that still mightn't affect those people from hating anything without Chris on it.<br /><br />Ultimately, due to all the circumstances surrounding this controversial record, and this band with an unusually fractioned, compartmentalized and vocal fan-base it could well turn out that this record receives the same unfair treatment and blind criticism as the Geoff-version's Frequency Unknown album or the last two decade's worth of Queensrÿche albums along with it. Sure, reasonable people may have disliked them because they actually did dislike them, but equally it cannot be denied that some people chose to dislike them for fun, for non-musical reasons or simply because it was the thing to do.<br /><br />Luckily for the version of the band with Todd La Torre, their record is actually very good. Very good indeed. Not so amazing that it makes a brilliant story of triumph over adversity and wins back every lost fan ever, but very good nonetheless. So even if a lot of people hysterically slate this album, the band can at least be proud of having made a high quality record that's just misunderstood, and if the album gets sycophantically praised-to-death just because people dislike Geoff, at least this record has the tunes to back it up.<br /><br />In summary, the good news for fans who are willing to look past all the surrounding story and just check out the record, is that the record is actually one worth having checked out. For those actually inclined to like the album as long as the music and songwriting is actually any good, this self-titled Queensrÿche album is no disappointment. The album is a succinct, and well crafted collection of enjoyable, mildly progressive, fairly heavy Hard Rock and Heavy Metal songs, that isn't overloaded with too many ballads, or weighed down by uncomfortable lyrics, questionable themes or over-sentimentality. Its just well written, good music, with some fairly memorable choruses, melodic guitar solos, and a lot more bite and energy than on the less popular Queensrÿche albums. Basically, its given the fans what they've been asking for: Passionate performances and high quality music that sounds like Queensrÿche wrote it.<br /><br />Granted, if you disapprove of any Queensrÿche record not featuring Geoff Tate (or Chris DeGarmo) then you're never going to like it, and additionally if you disapprove of Todd La Torre having a really, really similar voice to Geoff instead of taking the band in a very different direction (like how Dio changed Black Sabbath) then you are never going to like the album.<br /><br />Also, if you only like the band's earliest sound, while this is certainly a return to that spirit, its not necessarily a wholesale return to its actual sound all the way through. No matter how much you may hope, it isn't a rehash of old glories, so don't expect it to sound much like Rage For Order or Warning other than in a few riffs here and there, or in how busy the drum work is. Furthermore for those who actually liked some (or a lot) of the band's later day output, unlike what you may expect based on the band's live setlists, this album does not completely abandon every innovation or development that the band made after 1994 either.<br /><br />What this record does is mix the whole Queensrÿche back catalogue and it does it in an energetic, tight and well crafted manner. It is not boring, generic, or flabby. It sounds like a mixture of the spirit of the early days, with several of its sonic Queensrÿche signatures like the dynamic structures, dual guitar interplay and occasional trad-metal riffs, with the overall sound of the best examples of the band's modern sound (as opposed to the filler). Its got a lot of that power, harmony and flair from the early days, in a sort of Alternative Metal influenced shell like the modern stuff. It's a mixture that works, and they're songs that are actually good. Imagine the best stuff from Operation Mindcrime II, with the drums from Warning, and the vocals from Empire. Stylistically, that's a ballpark direction for this album.<br /><br />I'll admit I was probably a little predetermined to like this album anyway since I just love Queensrÿche so much, but this album was no chore to become slowly accustomed to, no poor album to pretend to like just for its story and no failure to live up to the hype, it was an instantly enjoyable affirmation of everything I liked about the band and a relief that this Todd project was not just all hype with no real substance. Realistically, it could have turned out that neither new Queensrÿche version actually had any good songs in the bag, and so then the band as a whole just collapsed under the stress of this difficult time. Thankfully, this is the album that Queensrÿche, any Queensrÿche, should be making. One that feels like they mean it.<br /><br />The music is packed with neat little intricacies and memorable moments. I can't wait to see these songs live, or hear what the next album is like. Listen to the pre-chorus in `Fallout,' or the bit in `Where Dreams Go To Die' where the music cuts out and Todd screams \\"With God As My Witness\\" ...or the main riff in `Don't Look Back.' Just great little moments that are better than the sum of their parts. Check out the opening drums to `Vindication' or just all of the slightly eastern-tinged `Spore' in general. `Spore' is kind of what the band tried to do on Tribe, but with that extra \\"umph.\\" Its that \\"umph\\" that makes or breaks albums, you can have a great formula but no \\"umph\\" and you still end up with a dull record. This record isn't dull.<br /><br />As long as you aren't preprogrammed to hate it regardless of what it actually sounds like, the passion, energy and quality of this album should win you over. Sure, its not the best thing ever released under the Queensrÿche name, but it's not just passable either, its a damn good album for Queensrÿche in 2013. Again, being realistic Parker Lundgren will never make fans forget about Chris DeGarmo, but he fits in the band better here than on the last two albums for sure. In fact even original drummer original Scott Rockenfeild plays better here than he has since the eighties. Its like the whole band just sound revitalized and \\"on it.\\" That's all large part of why I like this album.<br /><br />At the end of the day, it would have been nice if either the band had worked out their differences and made an album this good anyway, or if at least one version was called something else. Accept for example, started a revitalized career with a new singer without Udo causing any of these problems, why couldn't Queensrÿche? Max Cavelera didn't decide that the band which would become Soulfly was in fact also called Sepultura. Its a slight shame things couldn't have been handled in a more gentlemanly way, but as fans of music we really shouldn't let what is essentially office politics affect our enjoyment of the art. I would advise that you don't blindly love or hate this record just because you've \\"taken a side.\\" Try it out, see if its for you, and judge it on its own musical merits. Sure, judge it against your own preferences for genre, how the vocals suit or don't suit you, and what you usually think a good production job sounds like, but at the end of the day, do you like the songs?<br /><br />I do. I like them all. I like most of them a hell of a lot. I recommend you check it out.songwriting is actually any good, this self-titled Queensrÿche album is no disappointment. The album is a succinct, and well crafted collection of enjoyable, mildly progressive, fairly heavy Hard Rock and Heavy Metal songs, that isn't overloaded with too many ballads, or weighed down by uncomfortable lyrics, questionable themes or over-sentimentality. Its just well written, good music, with some fairly memorable choruses, melodic guitar solos, and a lot more bite and energy than on the less popular Queensrÿche albums. Basically, its given the fans what they've been asking for: Passionate performances and high quality music that sounds like Queensrÿche wrote it.<br /><br />Granted, if you disapprove of any Queensrÿche record not featuring Geoff Tate (or Chris DeGarmo) then you're never going to like it, and additionally if you disapprove of Todd La Torre having a really, really similar voice to Geoff instead of taking the band in a very different direction (like how Dio changed Black Sabbath) then you are never going to like the album.<br /><br />Also, if you only like the band's earliest sound, while this is certainly a return to that spirit, its not necessarily a wholesale return to its actual sound all the way through.

B002VRNR1Y|3.0|Good in its genre, but that genre is not to my taste. There's no supernatural element, just someone going homicidially insane from cabin fever. Too much like today's headlines.
B0088RQ4X4|2.0|Weird combo of eras or something.  I'm not sure why I didn't like this movie but it just didn't suit me.
B001NI24OI|4.0|It owes a lot to &#34;Remember the Titans&#34;, a similar, and also true, story. It has a very surprising, non-hollywood, ending.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|It just seemed odd for some reason at the beginning and then picked up toward the end and then finished well.
B003K07DUC|4.0|It portrays the collosal incompetence that was at work in establishing an ad-hoc government in Iraq when the fighting was over (or thought to be over). It's not news to anyone who followed media accounts at the time. For those who did not, it will be a disturbing revelation.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Overall, a really good book.  Started off a bit slow but then it picked up the pace.  I really liked how the book goes from present day to the previous year and back, very smooth.  If you enjoy mystery/thriller books then definitely recommend this book.  This was my first William Landay novel.  Look forward to reading his other books.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I thought it was fun and challenging.  But didn't feel overwhelmed or that I wasn't able to solve them.  Would play more!!
B008W8X5N6|5.0|This is the original and the picture was good quality! I love the old monster movies and this is the top of my list!! Great for a raining afternoon.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|The quality of the backpack is great. I like the fact that it has a lot of pockets and compartments for different sizes of items you may need. For me the only problem is the upper clips on the handles when fastened are a bit too close to my neck causing discomfort to put it mildly. If it weren't for that then it would have gotten a \\"5\\" star rating from me.
B008476HBM|4.0|I had previously seen the movie on our PBS station, and upon seeing subsequent books (Charlotte and Rosings), which looked interesting and are suggested to be follow ups to Jane Austen's book, decided to read the original book.  I found the language a little difficult to follow, but enjoyed the book nonetheless.  If you are a Jane Austen fan, I would recommend reading this book keeping the aforementioned &#34;old English&#34; language in mind.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|this has been a great tool for those difficult fractions that take up all of your time trying to figure out.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was a really good one, I really enjoyed reading it. It had a good plot, the charaters were easy to love and the story line was easy to follow. It grab my attention from start to end. 5 stars indeed!
B0091REZMW|3.0|I find this game very challenging. I dislike that when I wanted to play the game would not load. This is very frustrating.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Downloaded it on my Kindle Fire and it works great. Love the different accents for each room and 5 free games a day in the Daily Tournament room is a total bonus.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|Great new artist and a start of her work. Hope to hear more in the future albums of this star.
B00BSN0K1C|4.0|I don't think the face in the picture really matches with the face on the figure. Looks a little more like Tom Welling, than Henry Cavill, but it's not a $200 statue, so I'm not complaining. But cool, nonetheless.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|I was looking for an app to play the video and audio images I have saved on my computer and this app is perfect. It accessed my network with no issues and streamed HD quality video with no issues. It also looks like there is a way to play back video saved to the kindle itself. Excellent app, especially for free. I can't imagine what the pay version does that the free doesn't.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Like the John Puller series, I read The forgotten first and found out that Zero Day was first. So I went back to read it. Loved the character development and the story line. Would make a great movie, both books!!  Must have done a lot of research on the Gulf Coast to know the area so well.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like to play for stress relief!<br />Thanks ! And you don't even need Wi-Fi! I don't need anything more!
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|The concept was flawed. The acting was flawed. Arnold must just need a paycheck to pay for his alimony. Good action sequences though and some smart ass dialog but otherwise nothing amazing. I like Arnie but he is just not what he was 20 years ago. Would be worth seeing once unless you like smartly written thrilling action movies that the actors actually have seemed to prepare for then this is not for you.
B00005AWMF|5.0|Anytime you want some good old fashioned love-making music going in the background, you can't go wrong with Sade. The sound of her voice and the almost haunting beats just wash over you and send you( well me at least, lol) into another dimension. It's also great to listen to when you're alone and just want to relax and unwind after a long day.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Interesting, edifying to see the movie first and then read this novel, because the adaptation was expertly done. Some sections were cut out and other scenes added, tightening up the story line. I am not a football fan, so I skimmed through the football scenes, which took up a dismaying number of pages. In this case, in my opinion, the movie excelled, but the novel gave it a firm foundation. The great value of the work is the insight into mental illness.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great book #3 in the series....can't wait until the next! It is quite graphic but also very sweet and romantic!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Just started playing the game, but like it so far.<br />Hope they get more challenging, so far they are to easy
B00881VLCE|3.0|I tried it, but was less than impressed with the puzzles. I did like that you could change the number of puzzle pieces in the game, but the game was not very responsive at times. There weren't very many included pictures, and those that were included were just &#34;okay,&#34; and that's where they get you--everything else (at least that I was shown in-app) you have to pay for. This is another free app that charges for extra images that would probably be more fun to put together.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|I liked this movie and thought JL did a really good jod. I also thought De Niro was wonderful. He seemded to have a lot of practice from the &#34;father&#34; roles in the Fokker movies. Well cast and well played.
B002QCAXOS|5.0|I am not going to repeat all that has been said by others already.  Just going to add two things:  I loved this movie for the glimpse it gives into another world and time--and the completely different perspective on life and morality it gives as well.<br /><br />The other thing I would add is to completely avoid the 'new' version starring Nicholas Cage.  It is pure garbage, and I felt my I.Q. drop around forty points just from having watched that horrible piece of trash!
1616550414|5.0|I love this, it is the pride and joy of my bookshelf. Its like having a text book on Zelda. One issue that I do take with this work is that it doesn't have much focus on some of the older Zelda games, which gives me hope that maybe there will be a second volume. I would have preferred more details on Majora's Mask, being that I have a thing for Ikana Kingdom, but that's personal preference. If you're a Zelda fan and love to collect, this product is for you, it's jam packed with great information and stunning artwork. Even the cover looks great!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved it I wasn't expecting that ending at all! This is a book worth reading again and again, wow!
B000JML90Y|5.0|The book that guaranteed generations of insecure religious people would continue their never ending quest to ignore the reality of science as an attempt to purvey fact. This was of course, what realistically amounts to a staring point for evolutionary biology. As such, it is not 100% accurate, nor is it the most exciting read in the bookstore. Those things are not the point. The point, it that this is essentially the genesis of an arm of science that will continue to grow for the foreseeable future.
B005I548B4|4.0|The book is pretty real when we are forced into decision and relationship we do not want to be in.
B000JQUZCI|5.0|Written in the time following a large geological event. When in 1883, Krakatoa blew its top, producing &#34;the loudest sound in earths history&#34; he summer that never came yielded Edvard Munch's famous painting titled The Scream, and this masterpiece, Frankenstein.
B000AMPZF8|5.0|This is my Favorite of the albums just great and nearly perfect. I recommend this to all Muse fans. Buy the CD or the Vinyl copy and you get a free MP3 version of it.
B006Y5EDRG|4.0|Season one was great entertaining good for older audiences it is like glee but for older people I enjoyed watching the show
1433502410|5.0|While the ESV study bible is rather big, the content makes it worth it!  The articles, maps, footnotes, quick reference lists all make for an extraordinary study time.  I've been using this bible for months and I'll continue to use it for years to come.  I absolutely love the Hebrew and Greek references that help me more accurately learn the meanings of words or phrases. The historical and cultural notes help me understand the day to day lives of the people and societies.
B00C04H2VO|5.0|I bought it for my girlfriend. and she likes it very much, we take a pic of this little guy...<br />thank you so much.!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Such a great escape game! It's been a long time since I've found an escape game that was created like this, and not just a &quot;get out the door by finding everything you need on one screen&quot;. Must get for sure though!!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|No matter which way you roll, straight or otherwise, this is one of the best love stories since Romeo & Juliet. The acting is over the top, the scenery is great, the soundtrack is almost as good (at least the CD version is), and it will probably be the one movie Ang Lee will bereembered for. Everything comes together here, no pun intended.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Great escape game!! And I love the puzzles! It's not too hard or too easy, it's just perfect. Definitely a must have for sure.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really love this show and I'm not really that into period pieces in general. I enjoyed the character development which continues throuoityje whole three seasons. Though there were some sad moments and shockers, really that is one of the things I appreciate about this show. There is a level of the unexpected that a show like this rarely seems to provide.
0061997811|5.0|I love the book!!! It's so helpful to see what characters look like and ya!! It came in decent condition but great condition for the price!!
0156027321|1.0|The book was listed as &#34;Like New&#34; with some margin notes.  Practically every page was filled with margin notes - far to many to tolerate.  I requested a return label and sent it back but it was returned to me as undeliverable.  I've had good luck with used books so far but this was simply not as advertised.
0800141660|5.0|Enjoyed every aspect of the movie.  I previously viewed on imax and wanted a copy for myself so I was delighted that it was available via amazon.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|Doesn't do anything special. Just eye candy, that could have been vastly improved with some animation or something.<br />Even just a shimmer would help.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|Lee Child's Jack Reacher never fails to keep you fully immersed and committed in every one of his stories.  Always a good choice for a \\"you can't put it down\\"read.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|Seemed like a Siri alternative (sort of) but just was not that smart.<br />Asked so many questions just to wrong most of the time. Bored me.<br />Uninstalled.
0205632645|5.0|its got 4 pages of praise for the first edition and about 4 more for subsequent editions, but it seems worthy of praise enough on the simple fact that it is so thin.<br />Not written in modern English, no dialect allowed, but for the person set to the task.<br />This is an essential edition for any writer, teacher of English or anyone that would like to know how English SHOULD sound when written correctly.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Works okay as a viewer but fails as a sharing client.<br />Many times when I like something, the share button disappears.<br />This limits its usefulness..<br />Who wants to read Facebook TWICE so you can post, too?<br />It could be user error. Why make me try so hard?
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I could write ten pages worth of praise for this album, but I'll keep it to just three sentences. Queensryche is back in a major way and has given us an album worthy of looping non-stop. Everything on this album is excellent from songwriting to production.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|Looks like fun. I am still learning to use it, but that is okay. This appears functional enough to bother learning the interface.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|A great story, characters, animation and voice acting. This movie ranks right up there with the best that Pixar or Dreamworks has to offer. I can't wait for the sequel.
B00355L2TU|5.0|I was once a big follower of P90X.  Then I had another kid.  Then I was like, &#34;Who has 1-2 hours a day to work out?&#34;  I wanted results but I didn't have time for the talking and talking and loooong workouts.  A friend recommended this to me and I was immediately in love.  Jillian does not dilly-dally or small talk you to death.  You get to work, you work hard, you're completely done in under 25 minutes.  I saw real results fast, even after baby #4.  I thought it would take me a lot longer to get in shape.  I could not only see my body losing fat and getting more cut, but I also noticed my endurance increasing.  My bike riding skills drastically improved and I was riding longer and harder than I ever thought I could.  Even my husband started doing and he hates it (in that good, butt-kicking way).  Thanks Jillian!
B00BU18U82|5.0|it is the best game ever if you like farm stuff you will love this game but there is some stuff that is locked and to unlock it you half to pay 1.30
B007MB5OCE|5.0|You may call me crazy, but I found myself laughing out loud while reading this off beat, crazy as a coaster ride story. And, once completed, I pondered the sane wisdom that spewed forth from the very likeable Birthday Boy! This is not your average read, not your average author, and not your average tale of adventure...but you won&#34;t soon forget it!
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I don't usually read fiction, but as this book had been rated so highly I thought I'd give it a go.  I could have done without the bad language and vulgarisms.  The plot was very contrived and the character development suffered as a result.  I plodded my way through it, but it wasn't worth the effort.
B00CD4RPWM|5.0|I've read all 7 books in the Outlander series, and have illustrated 2 children's books myself. I really enjoyed it, although I was somewhat confused by the Kenneth character, who was also a traveler.
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|The HD went in and out the whole movie, not sure if it was the Internet connection but haven't had that issue on other movies
B005723JSQ|5.0|Funny, easy to read. Good entertainment for a lazy reading day on the beach. All the character are slightly over the top but still believable. Just a silky fun read!!! Enjoy!
B00C2U6G7C|2.0|I appreciated John Williams with Superman. Its one of the best scores to a film ever. But Hans Zimmer does not know what a Melody is. He cant get past 4 notes! Whatever happened to a Theme!! The Batman Theme that Zimmer does is 2 lousy notes. I liked the Batman Theme by Danny Elfman much better.<br /><br />I have some of Hans Zimmer's CD's. He is talented, but lately no way! 'Inception' is a great score, its so good that you can actually accept that mess of a movie and swallow it! But our culture is so different now than it was in 1978 with the 1st Superman with Christopher Reeve. Maybe we cant blame it ALL on Zimmer, but years ago he even knew what a melody was: Rain Man, Driving Miss Daisy, The Lion King!! What happened? Zimmer did the music for 'The Bible' series and it was so blah and unmemorable, that I was ashamed that his name was revealed in the end credits.<br /><br />The best score that Zimmer did was 'Thin Red Line' Very wonderfully played and Dramatic. Another good one is MI2 Mission Impossible 2, good action score that has themes and melodies!!<br /><br />Maybe Zimmer is too busy and needs some time off.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Fun book to read while on vaca at the beach. Moves quickly, has lots of easy to follow details that make for a lazy afternoon of snacks & reading by the water....
B00CWY76CC|3.0|it is ok for what u get. would like to be able to play more levels at least it was free
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Very detailed! Shock value was certainly there. The lead character was a bit too uninformed to be believable. I read this very quickly & was constantly shocked!  Fun, interesting $ a bit crazy!!
B005K0HDGE|2.0|Much too long.  Only reason I read it was our book group chose it.  Sorry I spent so much time reading it.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This book was more about shock value than anything else. It took me much longer to read & I was constantly thinking WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH HER???
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|Rented this film the other day, looking forward to seeing it actually. I think that the Attack of the Killer Tomatos trumped this film!! This was utterly the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting was so sad. The dialog that was used was way out of place. There was no flare in the dialog and lines. C'mon people, I mean these actors were using language that you hear every day of your life in this time. This is a fantasy film. Put some flare into your character! The actor voicing the monkey for example, Speak with an interesting accent or something. Don't talk to me like 2013. Make your character colorful and interesting. Watch some the older Disney films and that should enhance my point. These actors could have better than this. The character acting was Terrible. Go ahead and watch the wicked witch when she appears for the first time in the original film, and then play the similar scene in this film. Do I have to say anything more to make my point. No one cares about making quality movies anymore, I guess most people don't really care. Waste. On the bright side. Special effects were great, if that is all you care about.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|By the time I got to this book, I was over the whole thing. It took a long time for me to finish this book as it was just more shock value. I hated the ending of them living a perfect little life in their beautiful mansion with a &#34;special room&#34;. The ending S & M of Anna being 8 months pregnant, bound & getting whipped across the belly was just so ridiculous that I laughed. I mean seriously???
0307744434|5.0|Believe the hype.<br /><br />Like the titular black and white circus, The Night Circus is both light and dark, shining with the ethereal beauty of the wonders of the circus and shaded with the murky undercurrent of the undefined \\"game.\\" Easily one of the best books I have read this year. I could continue to gush, but part of the magic - of the story and the circus - lies in not quite knowing what to expect. Morgenstern builds a world I would wish to get lost in - at least for a night at Le Cirques des Rêves.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is so much better than the movie, which was good! But the details in the book really bring it to life and explain so much more than the movie. I love all the details & the ending is really good!! I wasn't expecting one part if the ending, that made the book for me!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun and interesting game.. totally gets you thinking. just need more levels to make it even better. all levels are totally different
B00992CF6W|5.0|Downloaded this for my grandson to play on the tablet while on a trip we took he loved it. He plays Minecraft all the time now.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This kind of games remindes me of blitz and bejewled both really fun games jn one. Alittle harder tho but really fun to make the time pass.
159463176X|5.0|Simply beautiful.  This story is always moving and sensative .......all through the long years and lives of wonderful and interesting people .
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I don't no why I love this game but I do. It is so much fun one day I played it morning to night. It is about speed and accuracy.  Fun game.
0887431461|5.0|This was a great learning book!!! It also teaches a lot of stuff that your child may not know. It also had a great shipping speed and it came before the estimated delivery date!! This was a great book!! 😃
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Come on who does not love uno. It is old school. It is a fun game and passes time a must have game.
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|This game is cool but it deleted all my memory I was on rank 44 now I'm . On rank1  monks kiwi should fix this
B004Y1WCDE|3.0|I have been using this for a couple of years and it gets better and better.  I noticed that the last update on Google Play was done on June 4th and these is no update to the Amazon Appstore. Is there a reason for this?  I can understand a few days/weeks off, but not this long.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|It is a fun game but for some reason it keeps deleting all my money randomly for no reason so i never have enough to buy something
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|We appreciated the story line as well as the fine acting across the board. The entire film was a wild enjoyable ride. We actually saw it again to get us ready to see in the theaters Star Trek Into Darkness.
B000IJ79UW|2.0|I wonder how many other people thought this four-disc special edition was I, II, III, and IV.  I am not that crazy about III and IV but in a four-disk offering it was tolerable.  Still, I made the choice and I'll deal with it.  Next time I'll be more careful in my choices.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I loved this movie.  It contained two of my requirements, It was mystical and romantic.  I have watched it several times.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Most games have so much waiting. This has some, but there always seems to be something to do! Tons of fun and super easy to play. On the down side gems are hard to come by and if you don't buy them, you have to wait for your energy to fill up from time to time.
B00C4U9U4Q|4.0|I'm not normally a big pop or electronica fan, but Charli XCX has an amazing and unique sound. Its a little dark and avoids the usual cliches while delivering great rhythms and catchy lyrics all the same. The lyrics are more mature than most in the genre and are quite relateable, but not overly complex or dramatic.<br /><br />'You're the One' is my favorite long song to date. Instead of the usual bubbly type love song its more about the new feelings you discover with love and the freedom gained from such a relationship. 'Lock You Up' is another great song about discovering that you're in love and where to go from there, while 'What I Like' is about the comfort and pleasure of a committed relationship and the surprise at discovering that you actually want it for the long term. On the other side of the relationship spectrum, 'Set Me Free (Fell My Pain)' and 'Stay Away' are excellent post-relationship songs that put the blame where it belongs (on both parties) and instead of pining away express a desire to have the ex just leave you alone to move on (specially in the case of 'Stay Away'). Nuclear Seasons is an in-between song about getting through the tough spots.<br /><br />This is a great album to dance to or just play in the background to pick up your day a bit. I am definitely looking forward to hearing what Charli XCX comes up with in the future.
0757302661|5.0|This is an amazing intro to the workd of hypno birthing. I highly reccomend this for your beginning journey to a natural birth. It will help prepare u mentally for a calm nice easy birth :)
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|I got Hanson's debut album when I was a kid and, while I haven't loved or even heard everything they've released, I've remained a fan over the years. Anthem is by far their best album to date, in my opinion. It's a little more rock and a little more modern than their usual fare but still has a solid Hanson sound to it.<br />The title is perfect for the style the band has taken with this release. Love, freedom, passion, independence, devotion, pain, and more get their own anthem here. The sound quality is excellent, as are the vocals.<br />One of the best things about this album is the fact that Zac Hanson seems to have finally found his own vocal style. In the past, he has always sounded as though he were trying and failing to emulate one of his brothers, to me anyway. Now, he's found a great niche all of his own and its only given an already versatile band yet another branch of sounds to use.<br />Taylor steals the show vocally on this, but the guitars are what stuck in my head after I'd turned off my MP3 player. This is a great album to listen to while working out or to sing along with while driving. It also has some nice tracks to dance to.<br />For anyone looking for an upbeat rock album to listen to over the summer, this one is a must.
B0049GYXDQ|5.0|As your average dude, I have an uncanny ability to zone out disney pricess movies. Sure, I was raised on your Snow Whites and Little Mermaids, but once I started making my own decisions about movies, I moved onto manga and Tarantino flicks. Princess and the Frog, however, is a beautiful exception. Not only does it feature a headstrong, lovable lead character that doesn't fall into the &#34;damsel in distress&#34; tropes that Disney is often known for, but it has a lively, unique story with great music and a wonderful message.<br /><br />HIghly recommended addition to your collection.
B006LSZECO|3.0|After all the hype, I expected to love this book but I didn't. It was good yet tended to ramble. And I didn't like the end at all. I certainly am not prompted to read her other books.
B00BESLHEA|3.0|I found the plot very slow to emerge and much of the action was the old style flying on wires kung fu type of stuff.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|Can't figure out  how to download this app to save my life! And it's too expensive to have such a minor problem which has turned into a huge problem because we can't even get to the game. I would give it 0 stars but that's not an option. We downloaded 3 other gamed today with NO problems so it's not my Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />Finally 24hrs later the app showed up in my app library! From there I was able to download the app with no problem. And it's not bad ay all. My daughter loves it and has had a lot of fun with it.<br />I still shouldn't have had the issues with the download. I found the app by accident! If it hadn't turned out to be such a fun app I'd be a bit upset after all the trouble but in actuality no app/should be that much trouble. I mean what's the point?
B000UBMSB8|3.0|Yep, I Bought the collector's edition solely for the original USA theatrical release (I think that is correct) where Harrison Ford provides narration.  It has been written and described that Harrison and the Director in particular disliked the narrated version.  I for one like that aspect in the right movies (see also Cannery Row or Last Man Standing) as it gives an added input to our viewing senses.  In Blade Runner the non-narrated versions It seems to me that there is not enough sound or dialogue to compensate for the lack of narration, or to support the story without the narration.  Who knows, I could have the opposite opinion had I seen the non-narrated version first.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|Kinda boring, you dont get many people options. The kids like it for a while then they get tired of it.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|What can I say...I think that the Alabama Shakes are very good.  I hope that they have much more music in them.
B00BJS7104|5.0|SERIOUS AND FUNNY ALL AT THE SAME TIME. VERY ENTERTAINING. THE VERBAL BANTER BETWEEN THE HOODED RACIEST WAS OFF THE HOOK FUNNY, I HAD TO REWIND IT OVER AND OVER JUST TO LAUGH MY BUTT OFF.
B00A14V0MM|3.0|Honestly I only bought it because of Alabama Shakes 'Always Alright' and yes I was disappointed when that song did not play out fully in the sound track in the movie.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|SHAUN THE SHEEP IS THE MOST ADDICTIVE SHOW ON EARTH. YOU CAN WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITHOUT GETTIND TIRED OF IT.
0062238868|5.0|You want to read something that is awesome, get a copy of this and enjoy. Incredible facts and feats! A true winner.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|The graphics are cute and there are a ton of dragons to breed. The game updates often. You can play without using real money and the game gives you decent chances to earn gems. Keep up the excellent work! Thank you for  a great game!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game.  Really got you thinking, even my younger daughter liked to play it! It was fun finding the clues and tools needed to solve each level.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Does exactly what I was looking for and accurately gives me the forecast. Other than watching the news on the TV this is a great substitute!
B001DUDKEY|4.0|Very beautiful scenery.  Characters were realistic and the story was easy to follow.The lighting was a bit dim, but otherwise a beautiful story and video.  If one enjoys romantic stories, this is an enjoyable story.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|France hasn't completely collapsed. They can still produce a great film when they really want to. This one should not be missed.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I have this game on my phone and was glad to see it for the kindle fire hd .hoping to see more games made by king.com
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Love it even for an old lady lol very relaxing I especially enjoy it with my grandson but play alone too.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game but not enough levels need to hurry and put more levels will delete unless this is done soon so hurry up
B00BEJ5O6Q|4.0|Sure do like Blake Shelton and have had his CDs since 2000. Great album without being his best. Keep up the good work Blake.
B005R2PDL2|5.0|I use this music to do yoga. It is restful, and helps me relax enough to do my yoga poses.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Love this little game. It keeps me entertained for hours on end when nothing is on Tv or im bored. I can't wait to play as a zombie.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I had heard so many reviews about the story being a bit bloody...and it is...but absolutely loved the movie! Very clever and  entertaining story.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This is the best way to play magic on the go. I've been waiting a long time for WotC to turn magic into a playable app and here it is.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|While it was interesting and a good story-and ALWAYS fun to watch Tom Cruise, this was just a bit dark.
0525953728|5.0|Great book, great read, a must have. I'd recommend this to anyone who can read, especially younger audiences. Puts a perspective on life
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I watched the documentary and enjoyed it so much I just wanted to buy some of his music.  His music tells a story...some are stories that make you laugh and others touch your heart..
B004LROOUK|4.0|A good overview and good approach to various cities/hotels, restaurants, etc. I was a bit baffled by the splitting of the categories, but managed to find it each time as needed eventually.
1423101502|5.0|grandson loves these books has read them all, nothing more to say! just got him a kindle he will start reading them on that now.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Sucked me in right from the start.  Definitely a good time.  My kids love it too. And it's free!  I've only gotten to level 5 myself but if it keeps my interest so far it's great!
B00AF6B2BK|5.0|If I had to pick a single Iron Maiden album to send into space, place in a time capsule, or have on a deserted island...it would be &#34;Powerslave.&#34;
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|This is one of my favorite scores from Zimmer. It's far removed from John Williams classic Superman:The Movie score and that's okay because this is a different Superman for a modern era. Zimmer has composed around 4 to 5 main motifs and spreads them out in variations throughout the film with minor additions that help create the scene. Top tracks are Flight, If You Love These People, Arcade, What Are You Going to Do When You're Not Saving the World, DNA, General Zod, Man of Steel, and Earth. It can get a bit repetitive at times, but it's not enough to drag the entire soundtrack down. Worth picking up.
0736041850|5.0|I've had this book for years and have referred to it many times. The anatomical illustrations and descriptions of exercises and what muscles are being used, would be very helpful to anyone who weight trains and wants to understand how things work. I think that the arrows that point from the names of the muscles to the muscles themselves can at times be hard to figure out in regard to what muscle is being specified, but there can be a lot going on anatomically in the illustrations also. You just have to look real close some times. But that aspect pales in comparison to how helpful this book can be to your understanding of weight training exercises and the muscles that are used, and also human muscular anatomy in general. An excellent reference book for fitness professionals. I highly recommend it.
B008MM9630|5.0|I like it no one to wait to send you things to complete stuff. Hope it gets better as I go along just started.
B0037NVM2C|5.0|This is my absolute favorite movie could watch it a million times great acting and the best storyline. I try to watch at least once a year.
B009GED3HS|5.0|recently got into the show, love it.  I am not a tv watcher, but got hooked.  Netflix Season 1-7.  1.99 per show is a little steep
B00005R2IS|1.0|This is just bad. I'm about 40 minutes in and having trouble with the concept of wasting the next 53 minutes of my life. The acting is bad, and it's basically violence and car chases with all the plot of a porn movie. It's the most piss-poor attempt at an apocalypse I've ever seen what with Max's beautiful home and the electricity and all. And for a supposed fuel shortage they waste a lot of gas. And since I'm over halfway through, how is this a revenge movie? So far it's \\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\" combined with what people think a motorcycle gang looks like and a crappy soundtrack that often plays louder than the actors speak. So far the coolest part is imagining that \\"Captain Fred\\" is Jamie from \\"Mythbusters.\\"
B0015RFCZ0|4.0|good movie with good music, more of a romance type of movie.  Great for a date night.  Not alot of good new movies out there
B007MB5OCE|4.0|A friend recommended this book, and I trusted her that it would be good. I was not disappointed. It has a little bit of recent history, lots of laughs, and just enough suspense to keep you guessing. It's one of those fun satire reads that holds your attention.
B00AK57N00|3.0|This game is all about timing, telling a guy swinging from a rope when to let go to land (hopefully) on the dead center of a post. The closer to the center, the higher the score. Gravity and wind changes add a small amount of complexity. It's  decent, mindless game.
B009RH973I|5.0|I don't even know what my Kindle looks like without this on anymore.  It doesn't add too much bulk, but it is so nice to be able to prop up my kindle while reading and protect the screen when I'm not using it.  This case fits perfectly and I have not had a single complaint.  The pink is a little closer to hot pink than the picture shows, but I love it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Everything was great! The only thing I didn't like was that if you walked away from something that needed a code, it reset. So if you needed 1-2-3-4-5-6-7, but forgot the sequence so went back to look, it resets.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|Great game very funny and a little hint is that you can talk to him on the phone I love it so awsome
159448385X|5.0|I chose the rating because the book was so well written and interesting. I could not put it down. Having read &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; I<br />felt &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; would be good. It kept my interest and the author has a way of  &#34;painting a picture with words&#34;. Mariam and Laila were two strong women that endured more than I think I could have. The people of Afganistan  and other<br />middle East countries have been through more than any country should go through.It seems as though the good people of these countries are the ones that have the hard times. It breaks my heart to see war and discontent. I am looking forward to reading<br />&#34;And the Mountains Echoed&#34;
B007ZD17XO|4.0|This is a fast game and very enjoyable.  The object for each level is to unlock treasue chests but have not yet played enough to find out what the end prize is.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Very good DVDs. Having a the original and the enhance visual effects. The Starfleet access Episodes. The home movies and Special Memories. The HD and the surround sound. Very Happy with the DVDs. Money well spent.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|AHS: Asylum is amazing, of course. It's one of the only original things on television. For the most part, it's well written, and we get to know, and even surprisingly sympathize with, unique and unexpected characters. There is a balance of horror and gore that keeps it from going over the top. This could easily go bad, and just when I think it might, the creators and writers show some restraint and reel it back in. The only thing keeping me from giving it five stars is that the ending for some of the (many) storylines felt rushed and busy. I wanted to enjoy the \\"comeuppance\\" of the characters who finally got theirs. But overall, this second series was as good and even exceeded the first in some ways. I am excited for the third series to start.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Now wit more plagues ad ons ill be playing this even more !!!!!! The zombie one is good plus the brain control is great ad ons , can't wait for the next too!!!!! O and u ant a pro at this unless u beat all them on brutul<br />mode.......
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was rather intense.  I love the brut in Gideon, protecting what is his.  I totally love home.  Great read.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|My daughter read this first and encouraged me to read it too. Great book. Reminds me of City of Ember.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Imagine very good story. But I sure do hope you have more than this for your readers!  I was left hanging and I don't like uncertain ties.  Overall the journey was fantastic.  I am looking forward for the next chapter for both Gideon and Eva.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I love this product.  I have lost countless earpieces but never again and it charges to boot!  The case is durable.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|To buy this set separate would've cost more. I am glad I could find them in a set like this.
B00D7NWTSI|1.0|Face it, a lot of people here are not reviewing this product sold on Amazon. They are telling you if they liked the movie or not. Many may even be posting a review on this 'product' based on seeing the movie at the theater.<br /><br />Is it an appropriate review of the product to say it's too expensive? Not just a little off but waaaaay too expensive?<br /><br />The product is this package of discs. The price is outrageous. I therefor feel that it's appropriate to criticize \\"The Product\\" for sale here as poor.<br /><br />On some retail sites, you'll see a ratings broken up into qualities, such as effectiveness, and value. Then those values are averaged. Amazon does not have a separate star rating for value.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|I have always been a fan of the Die Hard movies-corny and overblown as they are! This movie was just awful. Dark and dreary with wooden acting and vague plot. The stunts were over the top and simply unbelievable. This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time!! If you have a couple of hours and 5.00 dollars to waste-go for it, but after sitting stunned at the end of the movie at how bad it was I think it's time to let Bruce Willis &#34;Die Hard&#34;
B005IZLPME|5.0|I hadn't seen it in the theater and was surprised and amused by what they did with the first half of the movie. Chris Evans, the actor playing Captain America, was perfect.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was when they did too much with CGI, in particular the scene with a hanger/runway in a mountain at the end. It was absurdly long for the sole purpose of doing the action. There's creative fantasy and then there's just stupid. That's in contrast to all the other set design which was amazing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game so much I was very satisfied with the game because it is challenging enough to make it fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00797MB0O|3.0|It's a good movie. Charlize Theron is a great actor, and the movie makes you like the bad guy. thanks
B006IYG5HE|5.0|Jo Nesbo does not disappoint.  This was the 2nd of his books I have read, and I can't wait to start my next one.
B0082Z447U|5.0|I do not know where to begin with writing a review, except to say that this book is brilliantly written, captivating, and in my all time favorite category of books I have read, and one I highly recommend.  Rarely do I begin a book and literally cannot put it down, which draws me in with suspense, intrigue, and curiosity.  It's like a magical mystery where one thing on top of another on top of another just keeps unfolding to the point where I have to keep reading to find out what is going to happen next, which I find to be absolutely satisfying.  The subject and time period adds to the flair and creativity.  I love how each character in the story speaks their own particular perspective and experience to the reader, and found that particularly imaginative by the author.  Ten stars on this one!
B004J4WNL2|4.0|We read this book for our monthly book group and I found it to be well wrtten, well researched and thought provoking. We should have a good discussion at our meeting.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I'm addicted!  more games please. this game is extremely fun and addicting. I'm glad I downloaded it. I'm not one to rate anything. however, this game is different.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Very well made, lots of extras for people, like me who can't get enough of the WD. Now buy season 3
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I gave it five stars because it's the best book I've ever read.<br />I liked everything I didn't dislike anything.<br />I would recommend this book to everyone in the world.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|But not happy right now...not happy at all. Wanted a resolution to the whole Jace and Clary mess by the end of the book. Grrrrr...on to book 3.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a very fun game that challanges the brain to look hard and think in new ways about looking at things and helps you test your memory skills.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|Hmmm. If you believe that people can change, that Mother Nature cares about us, that motherhood somehow confers  wisdom and depth of character, if you believe that the universe conspires to bless us and that all things happen for a reason, you will probably love this book.  For me, it was okay, not disgusting but not believable or challenging or informative.  Kind of fun in its way, actually, but not a great read.
0399226907|4.0|My 2 years old son enjoys the book. I especially like it when he repeats after me the food items.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Perfect When I need down time- (p.m.s. time).It takes me away to another very different time and place. It's like a little vacation for me!
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I have read the book, and I think 3 movies is a bit much. One 3 hour movie total would do it.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I had no idea of the many connections the early Eagles had with so many other artists. Not only that , but how the band had evolved over the years with the different members.  I see there was a definite division amongst the members from time to time, but the music is magic.
0884271153|5.0|This book is a really fun story as well as being enormously educational. It offers a methodology to break out of a stale business model and look for creative ways to add value to the customer. I will be recommending this to all my mentees.
B002Q7JYPC|4.0|Waiting in the Weeds is my favorite track on this Cd. There is also a line in one of the songs, 'we worship a God who we're sure is American'. That is a profound statement.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I know is easy to fat finger things but these icons are so small my kindle doesn't even register my taps.  The graphic are good though.
B000QI2ZWW|2.0|The movie made my kids very agitated. The little penguin who can't sing is taunted for the most half of the movie and made kids sad and angry at the unfair treatment. There is some very fast/scary action for little ones (the sea lion chase). Most of the jokes related to the penguins who sing famous tunes are lost on the kids. I give it two stars because my children preferred going to sleep than finishing this movie.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is crazily addicting! Every chance I get I check my game to see how close I am to a new dragon.
0882847953|5.0|This book is ideal for beginners who want to learn reading and how to move an accent around a measure. This book is a must have for your percussion library. I go back to it from time to time and play random exercises. It's always good to go back to the basics once and a while!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I'm loving this series. Actually trying to go back and watch the series on HBO as I follow along in the book. For as good as I consider the TV series, the book is much better...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I have recently celebrated my 55th birthday and was feeling that all my synapses were not firing as sharply as they were in the past.  I got to level 6 in 20 mins after spending 10 mins figuring out how to play.  Once you get the rhythm of the game, it is great fun and addicting.
B000067FP8|5.0|GREMLINS was a fantastic frightening ride in 1984. Funny,yet dark..sick and wacky. It was as though they gave the Blob form and re-released it on Anytown,USA. Well..it took them long enough but we finally got the sequel that we all wanted-in a way we never expected.<br /><br />I personally love the first film,but GREMLINS 2 is more my kind of humor. Outrageous,satirical and self referential..its hard to believe this was a film produced by a major studio. It has all the traits of a college film students last project of the semester rum-amok.<br /><br />Of course a Bat-gremlin would leave the bat signal outline in a wall he smashes through. Why wouldnt Leonard Maltin love the first film after some more careful consideration? Not to mention we all have the fear of the film projector going haywire (they only show the movies,they dont Make them). And we laughed then..but you've probably watched the Archery Channel yourself,just not on the Clamp cable network.<br /><br />I love the fact that 3 of the main Gremlins can easily be distinguished as the Three Stooges incarnate (George/moe, Lenny/larry, Daffy/curly) and a deleted scene whose place on the cutting room floor is a travesty - when the afore mentioned trio crash Grandpa's Fred's set..its funny,and just shows that Gremlins and people can get along (provided they're dressed like a universal monster)<br /><br />I could of watched another half hour of the Gremlins goofyness - as soon as you get settled into the green creatures swing of things; BOOM,its the musical number and a slushy finale. lets hope that GREMLINS 3 gets a greenlight,and is in fact a continuation of Billy,Gizmo,Kate (and a peltzer jr?)- and not a dreaded 'reboot'.<br /><br />After the slew of horror remakes,reboots,and re-imaginings with no imagination (Psycho,Nightmare On Elm Street,Black Christmas, The Fog,Last House On The Left,My Bloody Valentine, Friday the 13th (ok that one was decent),Fright Night Halloween...)- we really need to stop the trend. 007 and Batman have come through it okay,but lets hope GREMLINS pays attention to the Predator series. They didnt flatout make a reeboot,yet it wasnt sold as Predator 3 either. Yet PREDATORS was well done and well recieved. Learn your lesson Hollywood,Saw & Paranormal Activity had their time,and films like The Purge show some promise. What we need is a good monster movie with some familiar faces...and jagged little teeth.007 and Batman have come through it okay,but lets hope GREMLINS pays attention to the Predator series.

B003WC5EQI|5.0|Per usual, the BBC killed this one.  The characters embodied the book characters.  They captured the complexity of the relationships, the foibles, and the restraints of the day.  I felt so much compassion for Tess, and disdain for her male torturer.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the classics, I highly recommend this one.  If, however, you are looking for something fluffy that has more of an Austin happily ever after, this is not it.  Enjoy.
B00C7NKPPS|3.0|Not one of Pauls best albums and vocals can be poor. However is a live version and expected that. Was one album I didn't purchase on vinyl but thought when remastered gave it a go. Waiting for others such as red rose speedway to get the remastered trick.
