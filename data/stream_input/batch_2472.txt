B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is the first Miyazaki film I ever watched and instantly fell in love with the animation. I had to buy it, but it is difficult to find it in stores. So happy that I found it on Amazon! Additionally, the DVD arrived within 2 days of ordering it, which made me extremely happy.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|I love this movie. The inventiveness of the dad is incredible and fun. The child thief is scary, so use your judgement when watching with little children
B009R659L8|4.0|Enjoyable mystery....likeable characters....an easy read....New York settings are interesting as always....a little romance, no blood and guts but a murder none the less
B004W1GCQO|5.0|Historical and cultural story that keeps one interested!  The acting is superb and period costumes make it a win for me and others!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Good game, funny cartoons, do buy. My favorite cartoon is &quot;The reassasince&quot; Definitely lives up to other cut the rope apps.
B009G78EE2|4.0|Great duo, tight beats and sweet flo. Lewis spins and lays down the jam while Mac soothes you with his machine gun rhyme.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was rereading  this book and was once again mesmerized.  I think this book was wonderfully written and one of my favorite books of all time.
B001JU4S44|3.0|This one seems like more Ethan Hunt than his team.<br /><br />The other two hunt depended on his team more. This one just seems like Cruise wanted to be a prima donna.<br /><br />I personally like the team concept better.
B004I744AS|5.0|very informative - especially looking up foreign words- sometimes run across foreign phrases while reading - thanks for offering it for my kindle
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this game and I will play it all day! My kids love it too! It really looks REAL! Even my puppy loves this game!
B002VPE1Z2|5.0|After getting this item, I realized that my camera would not fit in it.  But I liked the design and sturdiness of it, so I kept it to use for items I wanted to put in my purse that needed to be protected from getting marred or scratched.  I use it for sunglasses, and it does the trick quite nicely.  The construction of this case is such that I will not need to replace it for years and years, as far as I can tell.  Great zipper, padded material, nicely-attached velcro.  The belt loop in the back is put on well.  A nice case for a variety of uses, not just cameras!
0786869143|4.0|The title of this book got me curious about the idea of a Luck Factor. I learned some new things from it, but much of it was information I already knew. I probably will read it again and ponder the concepts a little more deeply.
B00902S0IS|5.0|Awesome retro sci-fi!  Effects were ahead of their time, but kinda cheesy today.  A must for any sci fi fan.
098555780X|5.0|instructions are very detailed with high quality photos. easy to understand and a great way the learn how to diy on the most popular paracord bracelets. once u learn how to make it, you are now skilled enough to start making money should u choose or just giveaway as gifts & trinkets.
1451650728|4.0|Great book! Data is alive again! Well, kind of. You will have to read this book to see what I'm talking about.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its graphics are great you can adjust its quality to make it your own. 2 is a huge step up
B00BI5J9BC|3.0|I was not impressed with most of the singing in this movie. Russel Crow just sucked and wolverine was okay at best. They had to add some dialog to the movie to explain some history to the people who are to ignorant to pay attention to history. It's an okay movie but if you really want to enjoy this musical get dressed up and go to a theater to see it done right.
B008CJ0KH4|5.0|It wasn't until his performance at the Grammy's, both literally and in terms of his nominations and awards, that I gave Frank Ocean a listen. I first listened to it on a sleepless night, and it has since become one of my favorite albums. channel ORANGE is an incredible display of Frank Ocean's musical ability and emotional investment. I'm hard-pressed to find vocalists who can match his level of emotion (\\"Bad Religion\\" - the scream after the second chorus gives me chills every time). His style is varied; traditional pop-R&B of \\"Thinkin Bout You\\" to the lounge-jazz feel of \\"Sweet Life\\", and of course \\"Pyramids\\" moves from dance track to a lonely confessional track. His lyrics possess depth and careful thought; some of his lyrics have taken me more than 30 listenings to fully grasp. It's hard to classify Frank Ocean as anything less than talented, and I don't think I've ever witnessed successful use of falsetto before him. If you are on the fence about purchasing this album, please allow my review to tip you in favor. Ocean is a budding star, and his chops are phenomenal. Additionally, if you want to witness his emotional investment, watch his performance of \\"Thinkin Bout You\\" on Saturday Night Live. If that doesn't convince you of his passion and ability, I don't know what will.<br /><br />Link to performance video:<br />[...]
B00BUCXVPI|4.0|Despite his offscreen persona, Tom Cruise is a great actor.  I don't  purchase a lot of movies, but this one was worth adding to my collection.<br />Art should be judged for it's own merit and not that of it's creator.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|It's a great game to play, I love it, keeps the mind sharp finding the matches and the directions they go.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This series is fantastic! The writing is great and the actors are amazing, bringing you into the story and giving life to the characters. I also love the moral values that are portrayed, something that has been lacking in many new shows. I have thoroughly enjoyed this season and have already started on the next season! I would highly recommend this to anyone!
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|Don't really care for Tom the Cat, he doesn't do much, there's not much to look at except a skinny cat.
B000IDEQTK|4.0|Good movie.  Watched this movie because I liked the cast.  I have never seen Helen Hunt in a role like this.  She was excellent.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|I love Ben, he is so funny, cute and a great laugh too. Great entertainment for children to see what he does with each choices.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|i love the graphics, colors throughout the game. pleasant, a game once you start its hard to stop. great purchase
B006M4F67A|3.0|Delightful mahjong game,  but freezes 3/4 of the way through the game on the Verizon Galaxy Nexus. So sad that I can't finish some of the games. Hopefully an update will help with this
0812982622|4.0|I read this because it won a Pulitzer, so I was curious. When you consider the research that went behind it, and the clever intertwining of real-life events and fiction, especially with a topic most of us know so little about (North Korea), I understand the Pulitzer.<br /><br />If I put all the outside influences aside, and had just picked this up while stranded on a desert isle without any knowledge of all that, I think I'd consider it an interesting and unique read, and I'd be grateful as to the insight it provides to North Korea, but it can't make my five-star &#34;wow that was one of my favorite reads ever&#34; list. Hence, the four stars.<br /><br />But, if you're wondering whether you should read it and so you're reading these reviews, I think that says enough about you to say that you definitely should...
0606257616|5.0|WOW I can read this great hardcover every year without having pages fall out like my 30 year old paper back and dream of REDRUM REDRUM til i scream and wake up sweating and needing drugs and a drink! Is life great or what!
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|it's possible that this &quot;deluxe&quot; version was offered as the FAOTD ... and maybe wasn't updated right away (or people saw a review warning of IAP's &amp; based their reviews on that). so far it says restaurants unlocked 12 of 12 &amp; no requests for money.<br /><br />one important thing - TURN OFF NOTIFICATIONS (and I would run in airplane mode). at 1st run it asks to send notifications (ads) - even if you say no you have to go into settings (little gear image on main menu) &amp; unclick the box.<br /><br />otherwise, controls are fine; runs like diner dash, actually easier on a touch screen than using a controller on a platform.<br /><br />I agree with others though - if IAPs were just disabled today ... shame. I would say grab this while it's free if you enjoy this type of game, and beware of updates.
0812452240|5.0|Got rid of my 20 year old paperback and got a fairly good hardcover so I can re-read and give myself nightmares which makes me drink and do drugs...life is good PARTY ON
B00B2166BS|5.0|This cable works great!! Much easier to attach than the standard cable, and no chance of wearing out the micro-USB plug.<br /><br />Even though &#34;Magnetic Pogo pin charger&#34; is listed in the official online Google Nexus 10 specs, they still do not offer the cable for sale. Go figure, as they say.<br /><br />Paulk9
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Outstanding achievement! I was captivated from beginning to end. Thank you for creating a game that stimulates the intellect, not placating to mere distractions. Much appreciated! Ingenious.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|If you love hidden object games..this game is for you. Has a story line but is all hidden object. Loved it.<br />Good game on my kindle.
B008B403VS|5.0|I love this soundwave and its even better when you have all the tapes with him. you can really relive some old school nostagia. Especially if you have Megatron too...lol. Once again I love this MP
B008Q00BOQ|1.0|Terrible acting, ridiculous scenarios.  Perfect face masks that could be used within minutes to fool the bad guys? Really?  It did make me laugh, though.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The book was intriguing and it was hard to put down.  Thank you for a great story E L James.
B00CDFWJIG|4.0|I really like the selection of the cast, specially Lena and Ethan. I know that combining Ama and Mariam, was not a good choice for me, specially if they are planning to do part 2 and 3, but the movie was entertaining. I loved when you watch a movie and you see that the places and people are what you have imagined. I guess I enjoyed, because I was prepared for the movie to be based on the book but not exactly as the book. Even if you do not like the script, I loved the way Ethan performed. He was perfect for that part!!!!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The book kept me interested and it was hard to put the book down.  Thanks for a great read E L James.
B00BXHE0CI|5.0|There is a bit of a dichotomy in my review because on the one hand you have the musicians in The Dillinger Escape Plan again making an incomprehensible beast of an album, but on the other hand it's much less stylistically evolved than you may hope for from a DEP release.  What I mean is precisely this.  The growth and development of style that characterized the jump from Calculating Infinity to Miss Machine, then Miss Machine to Ire Works is almost absent, with only a few songs offering something you haven't heard DEP try or hint at in other iterations. The material is strong and fluidly flows from track to track creating a sense of album continuity. The surprises for DEP fans are pretty few and far between as now in their career we've come to expect a couple curve balls, but when they do try something new it's hyper charged and super refreshing. If any fan from Miss Machine on heard this, they would recognize it immediately as DEP.  This has a much more renewed vigor for hardcore and makes me recall many a crazy mosh pit adventure which only adds to the charm this band exudes. Melodic elements are still present but in  much smaller doses.  Again some excellent recording and production jobs make this album explode like a pipe bomb in your face.  It's the Dillinger Escape Plan, there are no substitutes and no imitators.  Everything they try is pure divinity, and everything they leave alone makes you wonder what it would sound like if they tried it. Pure emotion, pure expression and almost pure creativity make this album another shining gem in an ever growing spoil of riches. I saw these guys get kicked out of the House of Blues Orlando for close to six years for their chaotic ballet of destruction, so please, do yourself a favor and go see them live before they get banned from your hometown venues too!
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|I thought this was a cool film. It is more action than drama, but the cars and a lot of the scenes are great.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|I'm sure this game won't be challenging enough for some but it's just challenging enough for me.  I love hidden object games and have been playing for a couple days and still haven't completed it.  Enjoying it very much!!
B004TI1WME|4.0|It works on my golden oldie Cruz T301 tablet.  This has a MIPS processor and the Froyo version of Android.  The app seems to behave as advertised.  One important feature I have to have with an app, is that (Well first it doesn't goof up this tablet, so I have to reinstall everything!) it can be moved to the SD card.  There was no problem with that. I probably haven't had it over an hour before writing this review, but I would assume it it works on this tablet, the app will work on later Android devices as well.<br /><br />So, if it works on my other two tablets, I will be even more pleased.<br /><br />I will give this warning, a problem which I haven't found a fix for yet.  On my 4.3\\" tablet with Ice Cream Sandwich, the vertical 3 dots -- the menu button does not show up in the screen.  Also the program can only be used in portrait position on this screen.  The default settings might be fine for most users, but one I'm not happy with, is that the default setting for keeping data is 10 hours.  Now, you can change this to never lose data -- but of course you need a menu button to get to the settings (at least as far as I can tell), so could this end up being a problem for many smart phone users? I know it is on my Proscan 4.3\\" Internet Tablet.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Excellent believable acting -- usually good story lines. I always look forward to the next episode. Each character is well developed and interesting
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I never had Mahjong on a computer, so I thought I would download a program that would do it, and perhaps play around with it, in the distant future.  It doesn't work on my MIPS Froyo tablet, which is not good.  In fact the only place I got it to work was on my Proscan 4.3\\" Internet Tablet. This has a weird processor and Ice Cream Sandwich Android OS. The app loads up and it should have no problem working.  One very excellent thing the program can be transferred to the SD card.  This is a very big plus for me.
0316069353|4.0|Good book, but not as good as Connelly's first mystery, THE LINCOLN LAWYER. The suspense keeps you turning te pages.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Dude if you like minecraft but hate not being able to play it on a trip or in a car or something this is AWESOME for it sure there not as much stuff but still BUDDER BUDDER sorry about that
B00B8WXG9G|4.0|Still enjoy the songs by this artist.  The duets with the different artists are well selected.  If you enjoyed Paul Anka back then you will enjoy this one.
0307460444|5.0|I tried several recipes and they turned out perfect! Everyone complimented me on the aesthetic appearance of the cupcakes thanks to the tips and tricks on decorating. Most especially the recipes are delicious and the cupcakes turn out moist and decadent. Word of warning, some recipes yield 24 or more cupcakes (a large enough batter to make a full cake), which is great for parties and other special occasions. But if you want to make a small portion to try it out, you can try to cut the recipe in half.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|I have enjoyed this selection of songs that Boz Scaggs sings.  His voice has always amazed me.  I am looking forward to his next selection of songs.  His style of music never goes out of style.
0061914177|5.0|This book presents ideas that can be used NOW in today's world. I appreciate his concrete cutting edge technological tips. Very exciting. Thank you.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I was so excited when I downloaded this to my kindle until I found out you have to be on Facebook, I do not have a Facebook account and don't want one.  So this was a real disappointment for me.  Would love it if you could just play it on the kindle.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Acting is excellent.  This movie is very thought provoking as it addresses several types of  mental health.  It is also very entertaining as the plot unfolds
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I put this on my kindle for my great grandson to play with him, he enjoyed it and had lots of fun with it but I must admit he loves the angry birds a lot better.<br />But it is a good game for the little ones.
B0037VNX44|5.0|What began as a seven-year sentence in Her Majesty's Prisons for aggravated robbery, became thirty years of Solitary. Tom Hardy (Praetor Shinzon from Star Trek: Nemesis) is brilliant in his role, as he channels Britain's \\"hardest\\" criminal.<br /><br />The film covers Mike Peterson (aka Charlie Bronson) career in England's criminal justice system. You can learn more about Bronson's life by reading his Wiki entry, his freebronson website, and his other books. For myself, I had some empathy for his character. He went in to do hard time, but clearly the environment of prison, brought out Bronson's worst (best?) qualities, and his life spiraled downhill, the longer he was inside.<br /><br />Of special note is his run-in with forensic psychiatry. The folks at Broadmoor/Rampton had no idea what Bronson's problem was, nor how to treat him. I could tell you how best to treat a guy like Mr. Bronson. Leave him the hell alone. The solitary cells he spends most of his time in, isn't good for your soul, and you are not going to heal your head and heart, in jail or a psych hospital, because they are traumatizing and oppressive environments. And yes, I say this from personal experience.<br /><br />Anyway, his acting portrayal of what it is like to be treated with an antipsychotic is spot on. Bronson got Thorazine. I was put on Trilafon against my will as a teen, and I acted the same way. You are a passive, drooling, shuffling zombie. It's cruel and unusual punishment. And it is punishment, not \\"treatment\\", as antipsychotics (called neuroleptics, which means \\"nerve clamps\\") cause brain damage over time, and constantly puts you at risk for permanent irreversible iatrogenic CNS damage, called Tardive Dyskinesia.<br /><br />Verdict: I enjoyed the movie, and highly recommend if you like to learn about the psychology of hard people, (and also you want to look at Hardy's big guns).<br /><br />PS. If you ever wanted to know how to get in the best shape of your life while living in a confined space in a hostile environment, eating mostly prison chow, read Bronson's [[ASIN:1844543099 Solitary Fitness]]ed space in a hostile environment, eating mostly prison chow, read Bronson's [[ASIN:1844543099 Solitary Fitness]]
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A great ending to a great series. Full of battles twists and everything one would expect from a fantasy novel.
B0045HCIZY|5.0|Why in the world did I wait so long to see this movie, some of the best hands down dialogue I have ever heard in a movie.  The chemistry between the two main characters felt so real.  I could watch this ten years from now and trust me I will and it will still be captivating.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Must watch in order, relax, soak it up. The characters shine and the scenery is amazing. I recommend it for your library.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|The game runs pretty well on my galaxy3 but occasionally does freeze and shut off.<br /><br />Please bring all the games in the diner dash series to android phones!
1451695195|4.0|Didn't realize that the author was raised where I currently live.  Tried to attend a symposium where he was speaking recently but it was sold out.  Book was laid out in a nice format that blended the account with a parallel time line of the events that took place for him spiritually and for his family in real time.  Anyone interested in NDE's would find this a good read.
B009X012XM|3.0|This case only has one position slot. It would help if it had at list two. Overall is not bad the price is a little too much for what you get.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple calculator and so easy to use! The only calculator app you will need. Large buttons and a nice, large font.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|Sometimes we just need to be reminded to break the mold.  This book does that and can be read again and again. Actually, the book should be read again and again. Thanks for taking the time to help us in a non threatening or demeaning way .
B0076DELIG|4.0|Michael Connelly writes another great story. I enjoyed the characters and references to real historic events. An entertaining addition to the Bosch series.
B005K17RU0|5.0|A+<br /><br />When I need to check the weather, which where I live changes all the time.  I can trust this app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well what I half to tell the world is that this game is awsome and if you don't well your dum
B00B2TUKI0|5.0|I am an aficionado of the &#34;golden years&#34; of music, and Peyroux hits some of the best (Bye Bye Love) as well as more modern classics from the wonderful repertoire of the likes of Leonard Cohen.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I thought that doctor who was going to be silly, not for teens, but once I started watching, I truly loved the series, now I bring bananas to parties :)
B0042TV4IW|4.0|I really like period films/shows and this draws you in and makes you care about the characters.  I am glad I stumbled upon it.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|It fits perfectly and I had trouble finding one that did.  Forget purchasing one from a local store; they don't fit.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I play this game on my Kindle fire. It's a simple game that doesn't require a lot of neighbors to play.
1439153663|1.0|I can't understand what other reviewers see in this book. I've read a lot of historical fiction and a lot of it about slaves and the old south and this one is just bad. It's overdone, poorly written and includes every tragedy conceivable. The characters are all stereotypes and not well fleshed out. If you want to read a very well written and researched, as well as compelling story about slavery and one slave's experience skip this and read \\"Someone Knows My Name\\" by Lawrence Hill (2008)
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|WE LOVED WATCHING THIS MOVIE, I AM HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASED THAT'S WHY I GAVE IT A 5 STAR. I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A BLU-RAY COPY FOR SUPERIOR VIDEO.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I love this show, didn't come into it right away but once I started watching, I couldn't stop.  There's a reason that the fans are so loyal of this show.  The actors are human and down to earth and the show gives me what I love most in a TV show, Humor, Drama, sacrifice and witty smart aleck adventure that is so very much under appreciated by those who have not experienced it!  I never miss an episode, record them, and buy them so I have them on my laptop!  My favorite show to date!!
B00CFQN12Q|5.0|Ok, so nothing beats the original DH obviously! Number 2 seemed to be a drag in the middle. Three was awesome and I loved Sam Jackson's part. Now, Live Free Or Die Hard (#4) was lacking in the sense that it was cropped content wise due to its PG-13 rating change. However I still enjoyed it alot. Now THIS DH movie (#5)was probably one of my favorites in the series. I usually don't like picking favorites (it's hard for me, lol, I like so much).<br />This DH movie was an awesome action flick that is underrated. Worse movies get awards and praise. People must have walked into this movie, expecting Inception or some monumental brain puzzling experience. This is not that kind of a movie. It is merely an additional chance for us to see Bruce Willis takin out baddies in a new setting with a new ally. And it succeeds as an entertaining action movie!<br />After 4 previous movies there's not much character building that needs to take place and to be honest if you've stuck with the series this long, it's because you like watching Willis kill. Admit it, this movie was very entertaining. When it was over, I was wishing it was longer! This is NOT a bad movie.<br />I'd go so far as to say this movie is better than Avengers. Avengers got WAY too much praise for what it is. Superheroes fighting aliens. That's Avengers' plot in THREE words. Try describing THIS plot in only three words. People are confused these days, they think overhyped trash like Avengers is the best movie ever crafted, then they go and bash this movie which is at least 10x better.<br />Thinkin maybe someday people will get wise....
B007V5CF5K|1.0|I'm so mad about this!!! I love Alawar games and was looking forward to playing it, but unfortunately if you have a Kindle Fire like I have, you can't move past the third level due to one of the hidden objects is right on the menu tab, therefore making it impossible to keep playing due to the inability to pick up the object. I'll be happy to play it again if this gets fixed.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I liked this game it just started getting really old after a bit.  For those out there who are in love with Temple Run this is a great game for you, but both of them bored me.  Three stars because it's good, missing two stars because it wasn't good enough for me to keep.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|What can I say?  John Sandford and Lee Child.  I am always on the pre-order list for these two authors.
B00A757EFW|3.0|This game was okay but I didn't really feel that it was suited for touchscreen use.  I used to love this game but found navigating it a bit more difficult with a touchscreen.
1452110581|4.0|I saw this book advertised in the Readers' Digest and looked it up on Amazon.  I read through some of the poems and decided to purchase it as a quirky Mother's Day gift for my mother, Jane the Crazy Cat Lady.
B008VBYN80|1.0|I don't want to HAVE to connect to facebook just to play a game, and if that is a requirement of playing it then I will uninstall it.
B005J4A8AY|5.0|Order this about a month ago... Was a cool box with the first season of The Walking Dead on blu-ray. I'm a big fan of the series and the zombie mask who was included in the box was total awesome! Well worth the money I spend. Recomended on the warmest.
B009AMANH4|5.0|As noted repeatedly in the reviews and comments, much has been written about \\"Lincoln\\" already-- as well it should. I've seen the film three times now, enjoying it more with each viewing and finding new ways of attacking the same material. What struck me from the beginning, however, was not the excellence of many of its obvious elements (performances, production values, style, etc)-- but the clear emphasis on humor throughout the film. For me, the film veers away from the traditional \\"stately\\" drama by setting a comedic tone from the early going and keeping it throughout. And I'm not referring to Abraham Lincoln and his penchant for cracking bad jokes and overlong anecdotes: I'm talking about the funny repartee amongst the characters and the punchy rhythm to most of the political scenes. Not only is this a wonderful way to help get us through a lot of exposition, but it's also a very interesting strategy to help provide a sense of reality and immediacy to these historical characters and events. This decision provides a contrast to the key scenes in the narrative and helps imbue these dark, resonant moments with more gravitas and solemnity. This was a risky choice, but it paid off in spades.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is an upgrade from Temple Run and it was fun for everyone. Even the 5 year old could do with ease. (Sort of)<br />You can buy more gems and it has more power gems. It is great.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is not perfect, nor are we. It captures the essence of humanity in an inhumane setting.  If you have not read it, read it.  If you have read it before, read it again.  Thank you, Mr. Card.
B009GEAWOU|5.0|I love this show.  I watched the first one out of boredom and got hooked. Watched the entire series in one week. Highly recommend it.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|This is a very good program to view, edit and print pdf documents.  You can edit, save and review word documents in a simple way.  4 stars.
B00BBQXQFI|4.0|Something the whole family could watch. From 8  years old to  72 years old we all enjoyed it and have watched it 5 time already.
B007CMD5AQ|4.0|For what I thought was a hard rock group, there are too many froufrou love/country songs.  Still worth buying it.
B003SNKBXW|3.0|The Kindle version of this book is very poorly done. There are very few correct punctuation marks, long sections with no periods, and many, frequent errors in the copy, making it difficult to read.  Do you need someone to edit these classics for Kindle? Call me. Also, I am not enjoying the book as much as I would have had I reread The Three Musketeers first.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Well-written, well-acted story about starting life anew. A hopeful and refreshing twist on a previously-done theme. A good vacation for the mind!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is the best calculator app I have ever bought. If you want a calculator buy this one. this is number one
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|lots to do and is very entertaining despite. how it tries to get you to fork over cash for better item.
B00BXLU1EU|1.0|It pretends to find the key.  But when you use the key, it failed to authenticate.  When try again, a different key will be found.  Obviously, it didn't work.
B005LAIIGC|3.0|The story is why we bought the DVD, we chose this gift pack for the hopping eggs that came with the movie.  One of the two eggs arrived not working, just buy the DVD & Blu-Ray pack instead.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|This game is a blast! It has the perfect balance between a really quick game if you just need to kill a minute or two, but you could also spend hours on it and get really good at it and go really far! I am very satisfied with my purchase!! I would recommend this to anyone that asks.
193700788X|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  I always wanted Sookie and Sam to get together, so I had no problem with how they got there.  The affair with Eric was exciting for a while, but then it just became too much...too much blood, too much strife and too much stress. For me, it was just what was needed to end the series on a good note.  Thank you, Charlaine!!
B0097K21YW|4.0|All in all, not a bad game. It is actually a lot more satisfying to throw fireballs at skyscrapers than birds at pigs. But either way, if you like destroying things, I would recommend this game. Worth 99 cents? Probably. Worth more than that? I wouldn't say so. Overall, fun playing a few levels at a time!
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|The person I bought this for. A gift she was wanting so she liked me buying it for her. I never saw it though.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I think this  version is much easier to navigate the verse and I am a new tablet user.Since May 7th 2013
193700788X|2.0|Many reviews have already stated what is wrong with this book. I don't feel the need to repeat, almost verbatim, what others have said.<br />If you are someone who can handle not having \\"closure\\" in a series and can walk away, do so. This is not worth your time or your money.
B0097C8XL0|1.0|My kids (4 and 6) could not figure the game out. We couldn't steer the penguin, he just kept going until he ran into the water. I even tried but have very limited skills.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Didn't think that I would use, but now reach for kindle hd before my calculator :) Easy to use, also.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love this game I played it at my friend's house and never put it down this game is awesome it just needs to load faster
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I enjoyed it a lot. I recommend it. I got into it easily and couldn't put it down. Loved it.
193700788X|1.0|After all the money and support your readers have given you over the years this drivel is how you leave our precious Sookie?  Eric gone, bill a good friend, Sam he lover???!!! What the hell where you thinking.  I'm so sad, and now she's gone.  What a waste.  I would have waited give years for you to write her proper ending.
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|The games keeps crashing. I'm not able to finish a game before it crashes.i have to reset the phone just in order to try and play the game again.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|my grandson had to have this.<br />he is still showing it off and playing with it, and he got it months ago.<br />i think collectors would like it too.
B004OC07N0|3.0|There are nuggets of wisdom.  But some of the recommendations are obvious.  It is a little like reading a college text book.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I like reading on Amazon Kindle because it is convenient but most of all if I do not know the meaning of the word there is a dictionary right where I need it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this show and can't wait for season 4.  Just wish it wasn't such a long break between seasons.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I haven't quite figured out this game yet.  I'm having a difficult time navigating it.  Perhaps I will like it more once I figure it out.
1619696231|1.0|I have listened to well over 100 audio books, many by David Baldacci, and this is by far the worse read audio book I have ever had the displeasure of listing to! The person, Jonathan Marosz, who narrated this audio book has the most bland and uninteresting voice, with no acting skills.  I am sure this story in a hardcover book form would be much more interesting than the audio version.  I really enjoy David Baldacci's books, but I could not wait for this story to be over, and there were 15 CDs.<br />David Baldacci, do not use this person to read any more of your books! horrible
B001NLKT60|4.0|Read it! You will be glad you did. Rate it and get to read the next book. See you all.
B0059Z5O4S|5.0|Great quality and great condition! I've never been disappointed with the leather bounds that Easton Press puts out and this one is no different! Awesome nautical theme and great pictures!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Our family has enjoyed the story line and the fantastic characterizations throughout the series.  Of course the setting is superb!
B00CDT41RY|2.0|But otherwise a dismal movie.<br />Tarantino can't balance his brilliance around operatic violence with big spaces. He gets overwhelmed. Concretely, this movie reminded me how much Tarantino excels in tight, urban environments. Give him claustrophobia and he's happy as a pig in mud. Slopping around slap-happy, yet usually smart as a whip. But give him big vistas like the American west or even the south and his story telling, indeed entire energy, gets lost. His work looks puny. His actors are diminished. And the stories ring as hollow.  Rather than resonating with big comic book genius they become small comic book drek. This movie had moments that captured the vile nature of slavery. But for the most part, it was just dull. And depressing. Avoid.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|Superb performances which capture every nuance, make this film a &#34;MUST SEE&#34;!  Once again, behind every great man, is an even GREATER woman!
B00BRBIA6C|4.0|I am pleasantly surprised, Agnetha's voice hasn't lost a bit of its strength and beauty. As a long time ABBA fan, there was never a question of whether I would buy this album, but after listening through multiple rotations, I find I'm actually enjoying it. None of the songs are groundbreaking, but they are all decent vehicles to showcase the voice and that is what this album is really all about; the voice. Welcome back Agnetha!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout for those with a busy schedule.  I am a new mom and it is hard to find time to workout.  I can easily find 20 minutes a day and it feels like I did a great worthwhile workout!
B009VB998I|4.0|My daughter absolutely loves this movie, of course it doesn't help that she has some fan fare add-ons (wings, dolls, etc...) I think I also have the script memorized jst like some of the pixar favorites. :)<br /><br />Great story, animation for any princess / fairy in your life!
B004YXE438|5.0|Great puzzle game!  Love using my own pictures as the puzzles!  A great game to pass the time while traveling.
B008P9M614|5.0|That attitude of his is something I cannot get enough of. What a perfectly confident man, in spite of all his apparent flaws.
B0036TGSR6|5.0|I need this movie and other interesting movies with spanish subtitles, please!<br />You must think in a very big spanish population that are very good Amazon´s customers and would like watch movies with spanish subtitles.<br />Thank you very much<br />German Duran
B001DM1VXE|2.0|Intriguing numerology and conspiracy theories buried in repetitive and incomprehensible plot lines.  Watching the main character lose his mind was painful and perhaps that was the intent.  But the story (or lack thereof) went on too long.
B006Q1SQCQ|5.0|Great tips for improving your memory. It does take a fair bit of practice to apply any of these techniques to real life situations though.
0385360169|1.0|I don't make a habit out of doing any sort of review of books but after reading this series and listening to the audio book, I have just about had it with the voice of the person in the audio version.<br /><br />As if the snotty \\"Valley Girl\\" sound coming out of her mouth isn't bad enough, she has to \\"attempt\\", and I say attempt because though she tried to create different voices for the characters, she FAILED miserably.  Poor Jose, I'm not even sure what nationality he's supposed to be going by the accent she's using for him.<br /><br />Then if that wasn't bad enough AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLL of her words end in this gag inducing, gravelly sounding, low note, that make it hard to concentrate on anything she is saying because all you hear is her annoying voice!!!<br /><br />Do NOT buy this - borrow it from your local library to see if you can handle the voice of the reader before spending a penny!  I'm so glad I did that or it would have been a utter waste of money!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game very addicting! They give you credits to play every day! Its that easy! Its very addicting!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is easy to read and understand.  It keeps your interest so you are done before you know it.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|please don't get this app at first its fun but when you play it a lot when you click on the game does NOT let you play this is bad LISTEN!!
1439152756|4.0|This book club pick for May is actually a lot more engaging than I expected it to be. Initially a bit turned off by what promised to be a depressing storyline, my curiosity piqued after learning that Genova initially self-published this popular novel before landing a contract with Simon & Schuster. Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease comes to terrifying life in Genova's debut. Alice is almost immediately relatable, and only becomes more and more sympathetic as the book (and her disease) progresses. She makes a few early decisions that did make me not like her all the time, but this only adds to the stark realism that is so prominent throughout the book. The authenticity in which Genova captures Alice's disease and symptoms makes this one of the more genuinely horrific novels - more so than the many titles actually intended to terrify their readers. For those with even a hint of hypochondria, this may be a bit much to handle, as it easy to self-diagnose yourself with this tragic illness.<br /><br />As Alice becomes more likable in the novel, her husband becomes even less so. Her husband's attitude throughout the novel, though certainly realistic, at times takes on an almost sinister edge to his selfishness. Almost entirely from Alice's perspective, the one rather abrupt and jarring scene from John's point of view does little to redeem him. But all of Genova's male characters have a less solid presence than Alice and the other female characters. It is an interesting book and breathes a fascinating perspective on this terrible disease. And perhaps most importantly, the way the POV is handled keeps this from being an overly sappy and sentimental novel. Yes, it is terrifying, tragic and tearjerking, but it actually is not as depressing as I feared it would be. I think it will definitely inspire a lot of interesting discussion with my book club! It is definitely one of the better picks we have had in a few months!
B005R32L66|5.0|I have it on my laptop and so I wanted a better way to skype tem because it lagged and it was great!
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|I watched the whole second season in two days and I can't wait for season three now to be released.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|After a long hiatus from reading books, this trilogy was my return to reading after receiving numerous invitations from co-workers. I'm so glad I listened to them, however, I'm sad that I'm finished. This was a fascinating love story, even though the writing wasn't the best, I soon was hooked. The sex described was interesting, and I had to go back and re-read some pages just to make sure I didn't miss anything! I just thoroughly enjoyed this series, and am now afraid of reading more books that draw me in, and cause me to feel sad again when I get to the end!
B003U9TDII|5.0|I love this movie. The sound track is awesome. It's great to listen to and the quality is great. Bye.
B00932A4XE|5.0|I loved this movie, I have two kids and this movie made me laugh and cry. I really appreciate the many different circumstances the couples deal with throughout the movie.
B00003XACV|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time. The soundtrack is great, especially when you want to veg out and just daydream.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I read this book for a class and would probably not have delved into this troubling topic had it not been required reading.  I am SOOOO glad that I read it, because it's an exceptional look at a (still) poorly understood issue.<br /><br />Early onset dementia struck very close to home for me, with the approach/arrival of my middle age years and a grandparent who ended up with Alzheimer's.<br /><br />If you enjoy exploring the human condition you won't be sorry if you read this book, and if well written emotional turmoil makes you cry stay near the tissues.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|The story line reeks of misfortune, injustice and soul searching.<br /> Well defined and developed characters must dig deep to locate survival strategies.<br /> In times of extreme historical times &#34;class&#34; systems break down and odd and intriguing companionship and relationship situations evolve.<br />This movie intrigues the socially aware and somehow seems reflective of today's social upheaval, although I pray we don't come to such extreme violence. With that said however, I think every human has potential for such aberrant behaviors.<br /><br />I would reccomend this movie for viewing to those who think outside the box, enjoy high quality performers, a new twist on old ideas and stunning  cinematography.
B00263HWM8|3.0|Was one of the better MI directed by Jon woo I think so lots of action let better than MI3 IMO
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|Great show, engaging, entertaining.  I also felt like they were setting up for a TV show or a sequil.  But Loved it!
B003VPWXRO|5.0|Open and honest! Could feel the same anxieties she was going through. Very well written and brave to share. Will help others to see themselves even if we're not celebrities!
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Great addition to the series I can't wait for the next one to read.I love the kindle for android now I read it on my lunch break year!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|An amazing book draws you in from start to finish and never bogs down or gets overly wordy like some books do. Over all loved the book starting on the second one now.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Such  good story and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys a good book.
B003097ABA|4.0|No muss, no fuss.  What you get is the only essential albums from the seminal Boston band in cardboard sleeves, all wrapped up in a cardboard box.  Is it pretty?  No.  But it's the music that counts, and for the price, this set can't be beat.
B00BHU9CCO|5.0|My grandson loves this movie.  The characters are precious.  I recommend for ages 3 and up.  Sully is our favorite.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|I've been waiting for this band to disappoint me.  Not that I want them to, of course, but in this day and age, I've come to expect it.  It seems that very few bands survive the \\"sophomore slump\\", and those that do are doomed to have their third release take a nosedive in quality... but here's a band that through three albums has continued to innovate without alienating their fanbase, and somehow managed to not overindulge their notoriety to create boring, over-produced music.  \\"Modern Vampires of the City\\" brings back everything I loved about their first two albums and also produces rich new sounds.  \\"Diane Young\\" uses a pitch-shifter, \\"Hannah Hunt\\" features what sounds like a synthesized/modified lap guitar.  In interviews, these guys said they take their time making their music.  It shows.  Another outstanding album from a brilliant band who has yet to produce a disappointing second of music.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I'm glad it wasn't white. Black is easy to differentiate from my iPhone and iPad charger cables. We keep the chargers in the same place on the counter.
B009CRJLHU|4.0|I want to start out saying I liked this book.  I wanted to take the book and Beat Travis and Abby over the head with it at several points.  Trent needed his butt kicked.  Ultimate bad boy drinks, smokes, fights, gambles, and whores his way thrugh life.  enter Abby.<br /><br />Horrible life growing up.  Looking for a different life, yet falls for the one guy in the book that is exactly what she should run away from.<br /><br />There were times I had to remind myself they were in college.  Gathering in the cafeteria.  Walking eachother to class.... but then they'd go drink a fifth.<br /><br />In serious need of Walking Disaster to see Travis' POV.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I loved the game. I would recommend it to anyone. Can't wait for the next one to play.<br /><br />Very interesting, the twists were perfect.
B0058SNIC6|5.0|When we ordered these I was skeptical.  I stand all day so i needed something with comfort and support.  I love these shoes.  They are so comfortable and they go with casual and business.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|Another story similar to but not even close to being the same as the movie frozen.. Still the same it will have you sitting on the edge of your seat very early on and through out the movie...
B002KYGLVQ|5.0|This movie drives home the point that the people should not fear the government, but the<br />government should greatly fear the people!
B008602KQI|4.0|I liked the movie.. It moves slower in the story line than I was expecting it too and did not have as much action as I had hoped but all the same I will be watching it again and again from time to time.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Found the  app handy to check on my sales status and the products I had on watch. I did have trouble getting back to<br />the search feature to look for  new items.
B001ED7C58|5.0|i like the music as much as the movie. no wonder the movies are inspired my MUSE the main band that's the author's favorite. I share their energy and passion towards electric goth
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is indeed a classic. In order for me to stay with it  , I had  to skim some sections as Hugo  goes into a great deal of  detail about French history of that period.  My Kindle Fire made it quite convenient to read. The actual book is huge.
B005MHI0QM|5.0|very realistic! touchy! classic! must read! and inspiring to the modern life that someone who can be optimistic and focused in such environment sometimes serves as a mirror reflects the brutal fact of the contemporary life are being materialistic, ignorant and careless. triggers good thinking
B008M721MS|3.0|Not sure if it's just me, but sometimes my Skype just stops working when I'm in the middle of a call. There are times where my Skype drops me from the group call, but then gets me back into the call (about 2 times, it didn't rejoin me to the call). Sometimes I can't join ongoing calls only because the option isn't up, I'm assuming that this has something to do with a delay of some sort. But all I do is leave the group and then ask someone to readd or recall me to the group. Sometimes there's a delay, not in the call, but when accepting/declining calls, it takes a while to load I'm assuming. When I'm in a call, I can't hear any Skype ims that I receive so I do miss a whole bunch when I'm chatting with friends. The Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; has a great web cam, my friend says it's a better quality than my laptop! I have my Kindle screen locked on the landscape but when I go into Skype it shifts from portrait to landscape when I'm in a call.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|this album has stayed with me until now. every time i go to karaoke with friends, this album is always the big hit. Adele 's simplicity and classic style has linked her songs to the contemporary modern living
B0059XTUXQ|5.0|My husband bought me this DVD for Mother's Day after I had added it to my wish list. I had always meant to put it on the list, but when Mrs. Thatcher died, I did it. Loved this moved when we rented it, and am so happy that I now own it and can watch it whenever I want to. Meryl Streep did a fantastic job of portraying Mrs. Thatcher for this movie.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This game is entertaining to both my 6 year old son and myself.  I like the characters and weapons. Good stuff, go samurai!
B001KQGEKS|5.0|One of very few I would consider complete only as an album and not just as individual tracks. I bought the original vinyl LP version in the 80's and am never tired of listening to it.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Straight and to the point.  Just what I need to help my lack of knowledge.  I use it often.  Just what I expected.
B008K9UZY4|2.0|The game is to busy to really enjoy.<br />The game has areas that are set just to keep you stuck.<br />I liked it better on the sega this one just isn't doing it for me.
B0050Q3UEM|5.0|Depending on my mood I can always find a 'station' that is playing what I want to hear.  Electronica is so big but DI offers so many options.  I love it!
B00ARAO0WM|3.0|Fun movie with an enjoyable premise/story and people doing crazy things on bikes. Nothing amazing, but its a fine distraction.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Perfect companion for my Android phone. Makes the process of saving videos for viewing off-line seamless.<br />Pretty simple user interface.
B00BESLT6G|1.0|I enjoyed the first movie quite a bit and was really looking forward to the sequel... Sadly, it was terrible. The events, dialog, and settings all seem somewhat poorly thought out and don't ever seem to form a cohesive story.<br /><br />Would not recommend, even for fans of the games or the first movie.
B008KRBTU0|5.0|I have 3 decks of this, as well as 3 decks of the original Spot It game.  I use them for teaching ESL and the students love it!  I go over the vocabulary first...word by word.  We practice pronunciation, the students write the words beside the picture on a handout I have given them.  Then we go over the rules of playing.  They love it!  There is lots of laughter and learning at the same time.  One complaint I do have is the Spot It Jr. Animals only has 31 cards in the deck, whereas these others have 55.  31 cards isn't enough.  The price is a few dollars less, but it's pitiful to get chintzy and limit the cards!  The game moves very quickly already, so with less cards there just aren't enough.  Great product, but the Jr. deck is a dumb idea.  Very dumb.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I am a fan of Kathy Reichs books, because she uses data from actual events and writes her stories from that.  This book is suspenseful and has kept me interested.  It includes science and a little bit of romance, as well as interesting characters, which makes a great story.
B0054PSY2W|5.0|Of all the Coen Brothers' films, this is the one that seems to appeal to the most people. No matter where I go, I'll always find someone willing to have an &#34;O Brother&#34; quote battle with me. And that just goes to show the Coens' excellent power for writing (and adapting) spectacular dialogue. And when this writing is coupled with the Coen Brothers' similarly excellent casting choices? Perfection, my friends. Cinematic perfection.<br />As for the Blu-ray disc itself, Amazon shipped it to me in great condition, and the film has simply never looked better. The desaturated, yet always vibrant tones look alive and well on Blu-ray in contrast to the sort of monotone aspect the DVD and VHS took. Highly recommended.
B005PK1G76|5.0|this fits my new baby jogger summit x3 perfectly and is a less expensive option than the brand name suggested cup holder. The zipper pocket is also very handy.
0066620996|4.0|This bbok provides you the methods, concepts and a whole package tools to built a leader or coach your employees
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This app has a good number of songs, several instruments and tons of options. There's even an option to allow two people play at the same time.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I highly recommend this book, you won't be disappointed!! I found the narrative so pure, coming from the point of view of a child.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|it downloaded fine but wont even start to install! I rlly want to play or at least get my money back!!! grrr
B0036S4CTS|4.0|I read the book first for my book club and loved it. I watched the movie just after reading, and though that if you did not read the book you might have missed quite a bit with the movie. My head filled in the gaps with what I had just read so I really enjoyed it. But for those who watched the movie independently, it might have left alot to the imagination.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You move by sliding the guy with your finger. You can collect prize boxes if you land on them. With the rockets you can soar up above the trains. As your dude you have to run away from a cop. You can  climb on trains. If you jump up and slide to either side you can run on that side or if you are on a train and there is a train  you can jump on the next train. I recommend this app to any one.
B005JR47R6|5.0|I watched the last season from start to finish. It was sad when it was over. The characters are so authentic. I will miss them
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a very fun game! I played on the computer and had a full version it's kinda better but in the kindle tablet is better because it has more items! in plain minecraft it has more stuff but this is better
B00CJ7EK4E|5.0|Rod has not disappointed with the new album and FINALLY new music.  It's been way too long of a wait.  I love the classic Rod sounds on each track.  I haven't yet chosen a favorite because I honestly enjoy them all so much.  Each track reminds me of a song of his from the past, but with new words and a slightly new sound.  If I had to name a few that I keep listening to over and over are \\"Can't Stop Me Now\\", \\"It's Over\\", \\"Brighton Beach\\", \\"Beautiful Morning.\\"  Ok - I honestly love them all. My IPod is full of Chris Cornell, the Decemberists, Arcade Fire, Death Cab for Cutie, Collective Soul, Pink, the Lumineers, and then there's Rod Stewart.  :) I tried to give this album 5 stars, but Amazon only allows 4.
B009D0LBRO|1.0|I didnt even get to play it. It took up way to much storage on my kindle. Dont get it.
B0060MYM3S|4.0|After reading all five books in this series I decided to watch the DVD's.  Season One followed the first book quite well and I enjoyed seeing the characters come to life.  Season Two was just a little disappointing after that.  It starts out following the second book, but then jumps around some.  I picked up a few lines from later books, and some were even said by different characters.  If you've read the books you'll be able to follow it, and if you haven't read the books it won't matter, so no harm either way.  It was still well done and interesting to watch.
0765367351|5.0|I've played the whole series of BioShock games, and i felt kind of lost in the first two, due to my age and my fright of the actual content. But this book allows one to re-live the Rapture dreams perfectly. Marvelous book. 5/5
B006LSZECO|4.0|Enjoyed the bouncing between the eyes of Nick and Amy.  I'm a big fan of little twists you don't see coming and surprises in stories. I will leave it there so as not to give it all away.  If you like well written novel with a bit of mystery and twists in the plot.. give it a read!
B00A85EMVK|5.0|My husband and I just purchased a new tv and blue ray player.  He HAD to have this and I must agree the picture and sound quality is excellent.  I had my husband turn it off, though, because I was getting car sick watching the flying segment through the Grand Canyon. So real I was sick!
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|Received this from Amazon to replace the original cord for my Kindle Paper white.  The original broke at the ends exposing the electric wiring.  Hope this one lasts longer.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I believe as Enzo that dogs are the next in line to become human. I have had many dogs in my life but two in particular that understood me as no other human has. Enzos belief that assisted suicide is good and Denny being able to give permission for a dog he loves as much as any human to go is the best way to go.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|I loved the music. the cd was in great condition. No breaks in the case. No scratches on the cd. I love the work from this group!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Different then most of his books with a jaw dropping ending you never see coming. Could not put this book down.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Thought this was a pretty good movie, both my wife and I liked it.  Crazy how real life events make the best movies!
193700788X|4.0|I can't believe that so many reviewers gave the book only 1 star basically because they were unhappy that Eric is not Sookie's HEA.  Personally, I was always a Bill Compton fan and I had always hoped she would recognize how much he loved her and would take him back.  But I understand that for Sookie, his betrayal was just too much for that, but at least she kept him as a good friend.    As for Sam... I always liked his character and was surprised when after breaking up with Bill she took up with Eric - I thought she would go to Sam.  It was so obvious from the first book that he loved her and she cared for him, too.  They came close to consummating their relationship on several occasions.  I always thought she avoided him at first because he was \\"normal\\" and I thought she would change her view after she found out he was a were.    Some reviewers have remarked that they in effect think Eric got a raw deal.  I'm not sure how they came to this conclusion.  Eric was extremely manipulative, conniving, and duplicitous in his dealings with Sookie, whom he claimed to love.  How could she forgive him for tricking her into taking his blood without informing her of the \\"side effects?\\"  How could she forgive him for tricking her into \\"marrying\\" him without her knowledge?  And on and on...  In my view, he was just outmaneuvered this time and had to face the music.    All in all, I love the book (and the whole series, of course), but gave the book only 4 stars because I felt that Ms. Harris rushed some of the storyline resolutions, especially Quinn's; I basically felt she included him here as a red herring and then quickly removed him at an opportune time.  Plus Claude's crazed revenge scenario didn't ring quite true to me.  I don't mean the execution necessarily, but Claude's rationale for blaming Sookie.    Goodbye Sookie.

B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I love this series!  It is a much different read then my other books, but it seems so feasible that this could happen. The intrigue is very unique.  Highly recommend this series!

1607066017|5.0|I had been hearing a lot about Saga a lot in the past year and with my renewed interest in American comics I decided to grab the first volume to give it a try. I had heard of Vaughan before from his Y series (though I never read it) and I had read part of his run on Runaways and I loved it so I knew I had to give it a shot.<br /><br />Saga's story can be boiled down as the story of two star crossed lovers form warring races trying to make a go of it while the rest of the world wants to tear them apart. The tale begins with the birth of their daughter and is actually narrated by her. Perhaps it's not an overly complicated tale but it's powerful and you really find yourself rooting for this small family on the run, who only want to live in peace when all they've known is war. Adding to the story is the gorgeous art done by Fiona Staples. I honestly would have bought the comic for the art alone so the great story is a really good bonus.<br /><br />If you've been on the fence about giving this series a try just push that add to cart button and do it! For the price that Amazon is offering it's honestly a steal and you'll kick yourself for not getting into the series sooner.
B002LFAHBO|4.0|This movie has a lot of story lines that all come together on Christmas. The soundtrack is great too. so
B009NY43NY|1.0|I was going to put my name on the waiting list at my local public library to prevent Charlaine Harris from getting my share of her royalties, but after reading all the posts, I'm not even going to borrow it.  If this author went this far off the rails with her own publication, I don't see giving her any of my valuable time either, much less my money.  Glad HBO is making up their own plot line for True Blood.  Maybe they will come up with an acceptable ending to the Sookie Stackhouse saga.
B002RI9HUM|5.0|I found this book fascinating as it weaves an entertaining story while very graphically describing the personality and behaviour pattern of the addicted person, and the treatment available.  Very interesting to someone who has struggled to understand and cope with an addict in the family.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|I do not normally like this genre but I we had Twilight free on HBO and watched it. We liked it enough to want to watch the rest however the Breaking Dawn movies I liked so much I decided to buy. They are in my group of favorite movies.
B00COGXX7A|4.0|It is good to bring out such abuse.  Enjoyed watching this movie!  Being a romantic at heart, loved the ending!

B008Z9YGEE|5.0|At first I didn't think I would like this movie, I now can't wait to finish the trilogy. I saw this movie with my 10 yr old daughter and my 65 yr old mother and we all loved it.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|I had this movie once before, but it got lost. I had it DVR'd, but it got deleted. It was so worth the $9!

014241543X|3.0|That's what this book was to me. Don't get me wrong--at times, it was very effective. I listened to this on audiobook, and I was fighting back tears in the last couple paragraphs (and possibly at various other points in the text). Mia was a decent narrator, talented and relatable (for awkward musicians like me, anyway). She often didn't talk like a teenager, but I can buy that she's not your typical teen. There were some very surreal moments I can't imagine ever happening in real life (Adam and Mia playing each other like instruments? Awkward.), but they were few and far between. I loved that Mia had ambition and talent and a goal for her life besides being with Adam. However, try as I might, I couldn't love this book. Looking back on it, I think it failed on a couple levels in a big way.<br /><br />The parents. They were supposed to be the ultra cool, relaxed parent that every kid wants, but it didn't work. If anything, they came off like 40-somethings desperately trying to show their kids that THEY'RE STILL COOL. Even then, they might have been salvageable if there had been some depth to their relationship with Mia, but they felt especially one-dimensional there. I get that they're a close-knit family and that's great, but did she never fight with them about anything? Ever? I understand wanting to remember the good times, but the flashbacks were supposed to give us insight into their lives and make the characters come alive. Something substantive showing us that they had conflict, worked to overcome it, and came out stronger on the other side would've been much more powerful.<br /><br />There was a lot of Adam love in her flashbacks, too much for my liking. Even before the accident, Mia was at a turning point in her life. It makes sense that she'd be thinking a lot about him. Post-accident though... I think Forman's intent was to show us what Mia still has to go back to, but it just felt like she spent an awful lot of time thinking about her boyfriend for someonewho had just lost her entire family. This could have worked if she had really sold it when she DID think about her loss, but that seemed empty. It was just, \\"My family is dead and life would be too hard without them.\\" What would that life look like? Imagine going to college without your parents helping move you, imagine that shining moment of Julliard acceptance being ruined by the fact they're not there to share in it. That's what I wanted to see her struggling with, but it wasn't there. She never explored the implications of the day's events, and the memories of the happy times aren't enough.<br /><br />When all is said and done, that was pretty much how I felt about the whole book--it could've been great, but there was too much missing for it to move me.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I share the feelingings of the other reveiwers, beautifully done,the hints were just enough to help without giving anything away, it was just to short! I played it three times just to see it all again!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|this is a great app that surpasses what an expensive sound machine from a &quot;Brookstone-like&quot; store offers. not only is it free, but it allows for a variety of sound combinations at the push of a button that traditional machines can't match.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I love it . It is so different than the regular one. You can do so much more in the game. I recommend this game to everyone.
B00498YZFK|5.0|This is the first movie I saw Jennifer Lawrence in and I saw immediately how talented she was and what a star she would be.<br />Very bleak and depressing but so depicts how life is in the Ozarks.
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|I love it because it contains all the necessary information a story would have  but, in a shorter form than other sources.
B005OOL1IC|5.0|This movie was just as good as part 1. I watched it a few more times with friends. Everyone loved it . Very funny. Can't wait for part 3  THANKS
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Great movie to share with your kids, and family... The human spirit is resilient and if you truly have a purpose and believe in your self, you can accomplish anything.
B0039OC64M|5.0|Every liberal should be forced to watch this movie assuming they dont read the book. This movie depicts the endgame of the liberal progressive movement.
B001AGXEAG|4.0|The movie was brand new and worked flawlessly. If I had the chance to buy it again I would do it.
B009YQJ322|5.0|a blast to watch.<br />Follows the comic closely and captures the feel of a dystopian future fighting to avoid falling into chaos.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|It is hard to do anything on this software on my Kindle Fire HD. I am not sure why, but I prefer some of the other Facebook apps much better.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Fun game to past the time. Easy to learn and difficult to master. Only complaint is its a game that almost begs you to pay for coins and such.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|My photos downloaded to my Kindle Fire from Facebook very quickly.  I was impressed and the quality was not compromised.
B0040I09RM|5.0|This is an altogether great show!  I have watched all of the seasons 1-4 and have not been disappointed.  If a show can surprise me with a new twist here and there it really maintains my interest, not only that but the family and club dynamics are kind of fascinating!  Altogether it has great writers, great actors, and all around great show.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had heard so much about this book that I was afraid it had been over hyped. Took it with me on a trip and couldn't stop reading it. Well done.
B005WQ4RP6|5.0|This is a remake of the same film made back in the 50's, even the same music. Robert Deniro is scary as hell portraying a an excon back in town to even the score on his lawyer who held back background evidence during his trial. The film is a psychological thriller, which usually means a terrible threat looms over innocence, but are they really innocent? Does Deniro's character have a good point? Scorsese really kicked this idea up several notches. A must have for your collection of Scorsese and Deniro pictures. Juliette Lewis also provides and unforgettable early performance. This is film history.
B00AAAKH80|5.0|Great tunes.  Good drinking tunes...party tunes...and it is clean enough to listen to around youngsters.  Highly recommend this album!  If you don't buy the whole thing, buy tracks 1 and 5 for sure!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This is a beautifully written and thought provoking move - this would be enjoyed by all age groups. You won't be disappointed.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game is good for people who are Into old fashioned arcade games. This is sort of like Temple Run but has its own aspects of fun. Creative how they integrated custom designs of suits and point system. Again very much like Temple Run.
1576754227|5.0|OK, I'll take the heat...call it simplistic, formulaic, prosaic, all the things some of my brilliant, organized and respected colleagues say. This is hands-down the most practical, straight-forward and downright fun reading of any task-management book I have ever read. I really do read it at least once a year, finding things I had missed on all the previous readings. There are two copies on my shelf at work, one for me and one to loan, as well as a highlighted-to-oblivion copy on my home book shelf. (In case you are wondering the other book is Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People.)
B002T9H2LA|5.0|I especially enjoyed that Patriotic Pride & courage exhibited by the American GI's. A lot of action, albeit a bit gory, but that is War. Very entertaining , Historic, with a wry sense of humor. Good Cinematography----Carol Zinstine, Texas
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I read this book.  I found Defending Jacob very intriguing and leaving me to think what would I do?  The contrast of right and wrong and a parent's inherit desire to protect a child was very thought provoking AND just when I began to think the book was becoming predictable the ending got me!
B004WR125O|4.0|Drops the connection once in a while and you have to power reset the receiver to make it work again.
B0095P31L6|3.0|Excellent audio, video quality. It's all about western movies revisited. A good idea. Recommended for adults and children. Have fun.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I love this thing!  It is the perfect gadget for mixing down the outputs from my 4-track recorder/player into 2 track stereo that my stereo system can handle as well as feeding my PC with a seperate stereo output that I use for creating CD's.  Great sounding audio, no decernable noise coming from the mixer and a three band eq and fader on every channel.  Without going into too much detail, the 802 has all the right stuff for my application.  The only detractors are the fact that is is not especially rugged in construction so it does need to be handled with care which is not too big of a problem for me.  But there is one thing that really annoys me:  It does not have an on/off switch so I have to crawl under the desk to plug in/unplug the mixer every time I want to use it.  I did contact Behringer tech support asking if I would be risking either the mixer or the power supply if I just left it plugged in all the time whether it was in use or not.  The reply was to unplug it whenever it was not in use.  Still, the Behringer Xenyx 802 mixer gets a 5-star rating because of its excellent sound quality, nice layout, and an unbeatable price for this good 4-input mixer.
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|Too much of the same type of songs.  my wife, a great Josh Groban fan, was disappointed with the collection of songs.

B006YTTVHO|5.0|I have used these skills to be a people person and now i love meeting new people i'm not afraid anymore
B00BHMF578|4.0|Awesome movie.  However, I did find out that it some of the facts were altered, like usual, to entertain us more.  Why can't we just stick to the facts?  Is a real life hostage situation not intense enough?
B001XCWPAM|4.0|Great video disks but a few dents on the box. Probably the fault of the post office and not the seller. Overall great quality for the videos, no skips or scratches. Arrived on time and in good quality, will buy from this user again.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is amazing. I cried laughed, And I am so passionate about this book. I have read over 700 books, and this was the best.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is actually really good. The only bad part is that it is 7$. Now it says it's 4$.That is not fair .
B007EECSFA|5.0|About halfway through a book my mind starts thinking about how it will end and this one did suprise me. I love a book  that surprises me at the end.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I read this every single day. I absolutely love everything about this book! I'm so happy I read this book.
B00A757EFW|3.0|If you love pack man you'll love this app. The app is pretty close the the real thing. I didn't like it because I found it difficult to direct Pac Man with the touch mouse pad provided in the game. BUT, if you're a gamer and die hard Pac Man fan you will love this app. Yes, give it a try.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Easy reading, great insight, well written<br /><br />I highly recommend to every one, specially if you are struggling with making changes in your life.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I got this thinking it would be an alternative to Bejeweled...it is not. This game is OK, but not much different from other games in it's category. I don't like that you can only play 4 rounds, then wait 5 minutes then you can play again. I could take it or leave it.<br /><br />Update<br />If you login using your FaceBook account you get more chances for free play. With that said I'll give this 4 stars. Once your lives are gone you still have to wait 5 minutes to play again.
B004J64QSI|5.0|My total favorite. Have watched it 8 times and want more -- love it! Recommend it to all. It peps me up when I need a lift!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I initially did not give this game a good review. But once I was able to load and play the game, it's great. I got it for my 20 month old son. It's too advanced for him to understand what's going on, but he likes the graphics and touching the screen. Now, let talk about mom...I LOVE this game, it's like most games where you have to build a community. I'm going to stick with the free play. I'm not going to spend money on the extra offers they have. The graphics are great and there's even a story line.<br /><br />You must have internet access to play, I would definitely recommend this app.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I felt the author included too many details in forensic science that a novice (like me) cannot understand or care about.  The storyline was good.  Also, I don't know the French language.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Rankin is always enjoyable with his great character descriptions and excellent atmosphere.  This one was particular fun because Rebus takes a tour through rural Scotland.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|This book gives a lot of great ideas for new aspiring authors like me who want to make a name for ourselves and possibly make a buck or two in the process.  The digital age opens up new frontiers for self-published authors, and makes it possible for us to go neck-to-neck against Big Name authors with Big Name publishing houses behind them.  Thank you, John Locke!
B000FC11A6|2.0|I struggled with this but only got one third through before I gave up.  Some funny parts and excellent metaphors but I was scanning through pages at a time and getting bored.  Guess I'm just not smart or nerdy enough.
B00BCOQSSQ|3.0|Disclaimer: I received a free copy of this book from the author. He did not ask for a review in return, but I offered to provide one anyway.<br /><br />Everville: The First Pillar was an enjoyable read overall. The plot is interesting and for the most part well-paced. Most of the characters were sympathetic and the main characters were developed enough for a first book in a series. Mr. Huff did a great job of setting up the overall premise, but still providing enough action to keep the reader interested in seeing where the story goes next in the series.<br /><br />I felt like I could connect with the main character, Owen, as a protagonist, but did feel that his cohorts Anika and Dante could have been fleshed out a little more. Additional secondary characters could benefit from a little more development as well, but that may be coming in subsequent installments.<br /><br />My main issues with the book - and there are only a few - are adjustments that would have been caught or suggested by a good editing. There are a few spelling issues, homonyms, and subject-verb agreements that need a little tweaking. The biggest issue for me was the changes in point of view throughout the book that frequently caused me to have to read back over sections to figure out what was going on. It was distracting at best, and also took away from the flow of the plot. It was also difficult at times to identify which character was speaking (but Mr. Huff should be commended for not relying on \\"he said/she said\\" tags!).<br /><br />The last few chapters felt somewhat rushed - partly due to being some of the most intense combat scenes in the book, but I would really have preferred more of a show than tell approach to this section.<br /><br />Despite these minor flaws, I am intrigued by the Everville story, and look forward to reading additional books in the series. I also highly recommend this book for younger readers as there is very little (if any) objectionable material - no swear words, no sexual content, limited graphic detail of combat. Thank you, Mr. Huff, for showing that a good story can be written without resorting to these cheap tricks.xual content, limited graphic detail of combat.

B0091REZMW|3.0|I've only been playing a couple days but there doesn't seem to be an end to these quests. Not sure if I'll be keeping this game around in the long-term but for now it's pretty fun. Sometimes it takes a while to load some stuff or it'll take a few tries to get the game to open but other than that I don't have any complaints. I say it's worth giving a try.
B008LG6SXS|5.0|I have seen a number of vacation booking apps. Some are pretty good and some are all about selling. Booking is low stress and when I used it to book it was simple and easy. I can explore many areas and compare properties all over the world. They want you to be active once a week which is understandable and looking at future trip ideas is fun.

B004TI1WME|5.0|The free version of Office Calculator was one of the first apps that I downloaded on my original Kindle Fire in 2011. It quickly became my favorite, most used calculator. Office Calculator is a great basic four-function calculator than runs very well on the Kindle Fire. The calculator handles the basic functions: add, subtract, multiply, divide, and percentage. The virtual tape is a nice feature that sequentially displays the operations that have been performed. The virtual tape takes up the left half of the screen, and the keyboard has the right half. Settings allows the user to change a number of things, like number of decimals, how rounding is done, and colors.<br /><br />The only minor complaint I had were the ads, but realistically, that's a fact of life for most free apps. Needless to say, when the paid version, Office Calculator Pro, popped up as the FAOTD, I jumped on it.<br /><br />It's most definitely a 5-star app.

0394721780|5.0|My Beautiful French daughter in law loves to cook.  So I bought her this book on Kindle along with Volume 2 of the masterpiece for a Mother's Day gift.  She is the mother of two of my grandchildren,.<br /><br />She loves it.  It is great for her to be able to make dishes she enjoys with American grocery ingredients,<br /><br />She can check out recipes while waiting for children or whatever and take it to the store to buy the ingredients.<br /><br />I also sent her the audio tapes of Julia Child's \\"My Life in France\\".<br /><br />Great to find a gift she can really use.<br /><br />:-)

B00CL68QVQ|1.0|There are actually two messages in this film:<br /><br />1.  If you are a mentally ill person recently released from an institution, remain a 100 percent self-absorbed jackass who works on \\"being nice rather than right,\\" cut holes in a garbage bag and start jogging, and before you can turn around you'll have beautiful women stalking you and offering you sex.  I knew I was missing something.<br /><br />2.  To succeed in the movie business, be sure to insert the most cliche'd BS Feel Good Hollywood Ending imaginable, never mind how implausible it may be to the audience, and never mind if it means asking us to pretend that TWO self-absorbed jackass users incapable of functioning in the real world will live happily ever after.  I intend to start my screenplay today, and expect to churn out a best-seller within a week or so, now that I know what flavor of treacle is popular these days.

1439190275|5.0|This new edition really explains the science so that you can intelligently explain what the diet is all about to doubters. The Atkins diet isn't about eating cheese wrapped in bacon all day. I eat much leafy green stuff on this plan than when left to my own french fry and butter on white bread sandwich eating own. It has excellent tips on how to do it if you are vegetarian or vegan too although it can be more difficult. I don't eat meat or poultry, but I do eat seafood so it's easy peasy. You stop craving simple sugars fairly quickly once you start and with some creativity, you can eat some delicious foods. 15 pounds down so far!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|People complain about the quality and that it jumps and this is true, but only minor in my opinion.  I have to say for me it is great.  I grew up in the country so we had a terrible picture all the time.  I do not think of Peter Falk as a sex symbol so the picture does not have to 1080p for me.  I watched them on my 70 inch TV and thought they were great

B00CKOYVG8|4.0|I got a Kindle Fire for Mother's Day, I downloaded Angry Birds just to see what the Kindle was like, just to have a game. My  girls, 5 and 8, wanted to play it and try it out, then my husband wanted to play it, they really enjoy it.  I'm never going to get my new Kindle back.
1607066017|5.0|Among other comics and graphic novels, both the writing and art really stand out. Vaughn is never afraid to buck genre conventions, and blends science fiction, fantasy, and even romance into &#34;Saga.&#34; I can't stress enough how good this series is; every panel matters, and there are no moments where there story treads water while the comic fills up a few pages at eh end of an issue. The artist also has the skill to subtly convey the characters emotions without the art becoming over-detailed or &#34;busy.&#34;<br /><br />Great for anyone who loved comics and big readers who enjoy a complex novel and are looking for a starting point to begin exploring comics.
B009NG1Q96|2.0|I was grrr....for most of this book I really wanted to slap almost all parties involved.  It was one of the most difficult reads I've had in a while. The Selection was a fun read not a lot of depth but it is the Royal Bachelor so what do you expect but the Elite drove me crazy and I finished it in one day just to be done with it.<br />First, for most of the book I hated America and her wishy-washy I want Maxon no wait I want Aspen scratch that another girl talked to him so I want him again back and forth back and forth ughhh it was infuriating.  She didn't redeem herself until about the last 4 chapters.  Second, I really wanted to know more about the North and South rebels and what is going on with them but literally nothing is happening with that arc, it is barely touched on.  Third, one minute Maxon is an awesome sweet guy and the next he is the scorned lover running into the arms of anyone else (still I liked him most of the time).  Lastly, America is always jumping to conclusions and doing something drastic after minor events I think she cried twenty times or more in the book.  While most of Maxon's motivations were clear to me America's self-doubt was crippling. The only characters I liked were America's father because he was supportive and reassuring as a father should be and the Queen because she was so kind and Regal but they were rarely in the book.  Aspen torqued me too hey I love you but really you'd be an awful princess so really I'm your only choice and you should be with me.<br />It finally redeemed itself slightly 3/4 of the way through when America, with nothing else to loose, actually does something bold that comes with some repercussions and then later when trapped with Maxon fesses up to her feelings and motivations and whoosh all their problems are solved mostly.  I would give the last 4 chapters of the book a 4 star rating but the rest dragged and was really painful sometimes.  Honestly if you are going to read this read the first 50 pages and the last 50 pages and skip all the junior high angst in the middle.<br /><br />Predictions for book 3<br />1.  Hopefully there is no back and forth anymore and America will stay as strong as she was in the end of the Elite and remain committed to fighting for Maxon to be the Princess he needs.<br />2.  Someone will out Aspen as being America's love from childhood. Hopefully America will fess up herself if not it will probably be the king that tells him.<br />3. She will use the Italian's number to force the hand of the King into letting her marry Maxon<br />4. America or both she and Maxon will be kidnapped by rebels to see their plight and ignite the fire of revolution.<br />5. The journals of Illea are widely distributed to help end the caste system.<br />6. Aspen and Lucy find love together.<br />7. America's father might be a member of the resistance or know more about it.<br />8. The king may die at Maxon's or Aspen's hands to protect America.<br />And for the love of god America please give Maxon a gift. Write the boy a song just for him or at least look at his photographs do something thoughtful and sweet  for him because you've acted like a spoiled brat.he last 50 pages and skip all the junior high angst in the middle.<br /><br />Predictions for book 3<br />1.

B00AMBLXP8|4.0|I can't believe I liked this movie, it had good laughs. I can't say I'd watch it repeatedly like some other movies though.
B00004WNHD|5.0|This album, sleeve and cover were in mint condition. The LP is one of Bob Marley's early recordings and is full of great lyrics about oppression in Africa and around the world. This is considered by many to be one of his best works. Even if you are just familiar with his more popular music, which I was, I think you will really enjoy this album. Listen to it 2 or 3 times and I think you will become a big fan of &#34;Survival&#34; by Bob Marley and the Wailers.

1476715904|5.0|Originally posted on my blog: Tangled Up In Books<br /><br />I know, I know. Guess who's late jumping on the Slammed bandwagon? This Girl....Oh that was terrible. I mean I knew once I typed it but once I got to the Point of (no) Retreat it was a bit late to stop...Okay. Yeah. I hate myself for that too. I think we should all just walk away now.<br /><br />No more stupid jokey puns. *Serious face*<br /><br />I made a small error before starting this book. Things I thought: There was going to be a cute, swoon worthy boy. There was going to be a great girl. There was going to be an amazing love story. There was going to be poetry. Yeah I was sure there were other elements too but my error was assuming that this was going to be an easy read. No heart stomping. But see I forgot one very important element. Two words. Well, really, more so a name than two words. Colleen Hoover.<br /><br />Things I know now: By page 27 I was already in love with Will. By page 59 I was on a cliff so high off the ground, thinking there was no where to go but to keep going up after their adorable first date. By page 65 rocks started to give way beneath my feet. I didn't even see that one coming. More rocks crumble. I'm slipping and there's no way to stop it. I keep turning and turning, page after page. And for every inch I get of hope and happiness I get knocked back down about five feet within a matter of minutes. But I kept going. Eventually the path evened out. And I made it to the top. And you know what? The view from up here is amazing. This book was amazing.<br /><br />I mean honestly I picked it up this afternoon to start it and, except for stopping for a few life/mom things, I couldn't put it down until I was done hours later, sitting here at 2:30am writing this. (Hence the weirdness of all this. It's sleep deprivation). I laughed, I cried, I cheered on the inside when Layken stood up in class and read \\"Mean\\" (read the book you will too), basically if you can feel it, this book pulls it out of you. No scratch that Colleen Hoover pulls it out of you. She's 2 for 2 with me. *Pats Point of Retreat* And I'm about to go for round three. After I sleep.t out of you.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|The songs are beautiful! I can put it on in the car and my grandmother, mother, children and I are allhappy.  There isn't much music can bridge four generations like that. I love the passion of the artists and the commitment to their music.  I love the way they seamlessly combine contemporary and classical. I just wish they had released their music videos with this cd as well!)
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|THIS BOOK IS A GREAT BOOK EVER MADE IN THE WORLDWIDE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA & NEW YORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />  LOL!
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Excellent graphics and challenging progression. I have the same game on my pc and I am looking forward to the next one.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I love the way this book is written it gives us great insight into how a person can become mentally unstable after being victimized by someone close to them. This book was well written and required that you pay attention as the story switches from present to past. I would recommend highly!
B00CELB980|1.0|alone and broken are much better releases than soft touch...  That is just my thoughts on the subject.  I guess
0930289234|5.0|a bit hard to get into but then it was...wow!  Powerful messages in this book and the graphics are fantastic
B004PR71JC|5.0|I bought this soundtrack for my birds and they love it.  I really enjoy the rhythm and I also enjoy listening to it very much.
B007SGM084|5.0|Completely obsessed!  Read the entire trilogy the first time within a week! I've gone back to re-read it two more times since then and its always entertaining!
B0074JOCIG|5.0|This live concert is EXCELLENT!! Joe Bonamassa is a true guitar virtuoso!!!! I will watch this DVD over and over again!!
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|This movie was too long to be that boring. I had to stop watching because it kept putting me to sleep. I'm sorry it just wasn't worth it to me.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The only thing I'd complain about is I WANTED MORE! Really exciting game, loved it, really looking forward for more.
B004TI1WME|5.0|I like this one a lot. many features or options for layout and viewing. The folks who want to export or keep results for an audit are unfairly rating this app. The vendor did not make it for that purpose. Tape is cleared automatically after max of 10 hours. Nice portrait and landscape mode.
B008JF8O9M|5.0|I recently ordered a Kindle fire 8.9 from Amazon. I needed a connection  to my printer, a Canon MG 5320, also ordered from Amazon. This was the third app I downloaded, and it worked where as neither of the other two could establish a connection.<br />No problems what-so-ever.
B0072OFM28|5.0|There are not many series on TV that a woman can hang at the water cooler with the men and discuss an episode of a show together.  Ladies; just because this seems like a 'mans' show - you have got to watch.  You have no idea what you are missing...
B006ZOGM2A|5.0|I'm reviewing the 4-LP box set.<br /><br />This live show is a legendary bootleg. Essential for any Bruce fan, because it's a breaking point in the boss career (new bands members, \\"Born to run\\" is around the corner, etc.).<br /><br />Don't get scared by the bootleg thing, the audio is superb.<br /><br />The box set itself is beautiful. It opens like a book with a great text about various aspect of this record (The Venues, The Songs, etc).
075669812X|5.0|I ordered this book as a gift for 7yr old grandson...he knew exactly what he wanted. He mentioned it while in the book store....so I sent it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|works great on my galaxy S3 and my Toshiba Tablet. keeps everything in sync and updated, and its Free..how could you not love that!
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|If you have seen Unglorious Bastards and liked Christoph Waltz then you will like this Tarentino effort even more. At least in this one the murdering bastard has a heart. Jamie Foxx is not the best badass you have ever seen but he will suffice. The story is decent, the plot moves along well enough. Waltz is the MAN and he is worth watching just for his acting skills alone. I give him 5 stars for his performance alone.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|Fantastic Movie full of feeling and love.  I could relate to so much of this.  I would see it again for sure.
1878424319|5.0|This book will transform your thinking and your life.  I plan on purchasing the companion book as well as the cards.  I really want to live by these principals.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Returns the focus from the villain to Batman, letting Bale shine, and Hathaway is great fun.  Not always logical, but always engrossing. A strong 4 stars.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|I loved this movie! It was perfect for a date night. Just enough action for the hubs & relationship building/romance for me. Plus it's always great to see the bad guy get justice & the good guy get happiness.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to play with customizable cards and backgrounds as well as types of games. My personal favorites are the adorable kitty cards on a solid blue background. However, the pop-up ads between games can be a bit annoying but can be skipped with a single click usually. Beware, it can get addicting to try to out score yourself playing over and over and over again...
B004TI5N38|5.0|Baldacci is a master of the craft...plots that twist and turn, well researched and believable scenerios<br />Characters that jump off the page and live with you.  My only regret is waiting for the next novel!<br />As always amazing!  C. Wilhite
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a great story.  A story of a character we grow to love because of his goodness, despite his weaknesses. And just like Ender learns to understand and love those he sees we also learn to understand and love Ender in all his faults and strengths.  It is what every person wants for themselves; love and acceptance of who we are along with our faults.  It's part of what makes us a whole individual being. One that can, with time, patience, and diligence, overcome our weaknesses to become who we want to be.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This is my favorite show on tv. I love all the characters and all the storylines. I love the complicated nature of Alicia's love life. I'm looking forward to next season.
0374533571|3.0|There will be spoilers.<br /><br />I felt guilty for not liking this book.  I wanted to.  I wanted to read it before seeing the movie since everyone crowed about how wonderful it was and Jennifer Lawrence won an Oscar for her performance (that she should have won for Winter's Bone or The Poker House instead). Now I'm not in any hurry to see the movie, because unless the movie does something to make Pat less frustrating, I wouldn't be able to sit through it.<br /><br />Our hero, Pat, is released from \\"the bad place\\", a neural rehabilitation center, into the care of his parents. There are vague hints about how he ended up in there, and we slowly realize that Pat's been through something very bad involving his wife - who we soon realize is only his wife in his mind - and is trying to rebuild his life.  Pat works out and waxes eloquent about how he is going to be a better husband for his wife after \\"apart time\\" ends.  He improves himself by working out obsessively all day, every day.  He reads books so he can be more intellectual.  He tries to reconnect with his family. Oh, and above all, he believes in silver linings.  Everything has to have a happy ending, a silver lining. He has the requisitely quirky therapist he sees once a week.  His therapist as well as his friends and family try to push him into a new romance so he can get over his wife.  We know what \\"apart time\\" means, but Pat refuses to let go of his fantasy.  His new relationship is with another depressed and damaged soul.  And there you have one of the many glaring things that bothered me.<br /><br />Pat was also singularly one of the most frustrating and annoying characters I think I've ever read.  I couldn't and can't stand him. I didn't really feel one way or the other about Tiffany, except feel sad for her, and I wondered who on earth thought trying to distract Pat by using this fragile, damaged woman was a good idea. It's made clear many times that people have tried to get Pat to remember and live with reality, but his single-minded focus on his wife drove me up a wall.  I get that he had explosive anger issues and what with the working out he was physically imposing and due to his history potentially dangerous, but it irritated me that rather than actually helping him, they enabled him.  His parents to me were the real characters, and his mother was what made the whole thing tolerable for me.<br /><br />Pat was a nonentity to me, a blank on the page.  An annoying blank on the page.  And why anyone was angry with Tiffany for doing what she did to try and help him (in her mind, as misguided as she was, BUT WHY WOULDN'T SHE BE), what were they thinking? Her character was more wooden than Pat, and while I can see her doing what she did and understanding why, if everyone knew she was that unstable and that depressed, why even think that either of them would be good for the other? And the dancing - yes, I get the whys and the hows, but it was written so strangely, it seemed wedged in and didn't really fit.<br /><br />I'm not bashing the mentally ill, or the mentally handicapped. And Pat didn't strike me as mentally handicapped, he struck me as garden-variety delusional. I didn't feel that being in that home environment or with Tiffany was good for him in any way.  I understand that in the real world we all make decisions that are not the ideal but are the best we can do under the circumstances.  I know that's what Pat's mother and family wanted for him, but all I could see them doing was enabling him. And I completely feel that the therapist was written while the author pictured Ben Kingsley in all his quirky glory, even if that wasn't who plays him in the movie.  At any rate, no therapist would A) risk setting off a delusional patient in the waiting room, or B) socialize with a patient outside of the therapeutic environment.  And yes it's a book and yes it's supposed to make their connection stronger and yes I know that it's nitpicking but that's how much it botheredme.<br /><br />It wasn't a badly written book, it just seemed threadbare, and not really at all in connection to mental health or recovery from a breakdown. And I understand that Pat's relentless delusional belief in happy endings was supposed to be charming and uplifting, but to me it was just sad.me.<br /><br />It wasn't a badly written book, it just seemed threadbare, and not really at all in connection to mental health or recovery from a breakdown.

B00AECGQF2|5.0|This is such a good game! My bro is 14 and he likes it. I love this game and recommend it to all ages
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I absolutely love this show! It's full of drama, love and suspense all at once. It brilliantly tells you the story of the servants and the lords to keep it really interesting. Five stars!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a fun easy read story of romance, love and laughter.  A cinderella story that every girl hopes for in the end.  The ending was predictable, but still a fun read.  Definately a chick read.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|So one day I decided I was going to buy myself a new pc mouse, the one I had was an older wireless one that was dying on me.  SO I went over to amazon and started randomly searching for pc mice, and this one was the first one I found and looked at.  It seemed to fit all my needs, I use my tower for personal use, work, school related stuff, and gaming here and there.  Upon reading the reviews and doing some research outside of amazon, I confirmed all the reviews that said this is a great product.  To be honest, the anchor logo on the back was the detail that totally made me want to but it (I'm a sucker for anything related to traditional tattooes/pinups, sailor jerry related artwork, etc.).  But let me tell you, this is an AWESOME mouse for the price I paid!  I originally thought I wanted a high end gaming mouse that run in the $100+ range...and I believe this thing is just as good as those high end ones, and for half the price!  Glad I didn't just blindly pick an expensive one that has the reputation attached to it, I am beyond happy with this mouse.  Besides the price; the looks, feel (fits excellently in hand, doesn't matter if you \\"palm\\" or \\"claw\\" it, because I happen to do both), and extensive software makes this mouse perfect for your needs.  No need looking any further!  You found the mouse of your dreams!  I do love how you can customize every button on the mouse, and you're not limited to the options on the drop down boxes, you can even input your own commands!  It also is able to store 2 separate profiles that can be switched between by simply pressing a button.  For the average person, this mouse will do anything you need it to do.  For the gamer, I know it's hard to sell some of you guys.  I do enjoy how the DPI switch it easily accessible, and that is clutch for needing to say switch the response/speed of pointer when playing a fps or mmmorpg or whatever your games of choice are.  The ONLY drawback is that the button that switches profiles in on the underside of the mouse, HOWEVER, you can program another button to fulfill that role, but that means you would loose another easily accessible button.  Overall this thing gets a 10/10, with my only issue being the one button on the under side (which is reality is not a huge deal at all).  I would definitely recommend it for the price, looks, and performance, you'd be hard pressed to find a product of similar caliber in the same price range.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|It's a love story, a tragedy, a story of self discovery.  This story made me appreciate all the people who have touched my life.  Thank you Harold Fry.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|The item arrive quickly and I couldn't wait to give it a try.  Unfortunately, the mouse didn't even last an hour.  Shortly after the drivers installed, the mouse pointer began to \\"phantom crawl\\" across my monitors at an increasingly erratic pace.  It then finally gave out altogether and the pointer would not move at all.  The other buttons worked fine.  I tried everything to fix the problem to no avail.  I installed it on another PC and no dice.<br /><br />I was pretty let down by the experience considering the mouse had some pretty great features and the ergonomics provided a natural comfort fit in my hand.  Unfortunately, a replacement option was unavailable in the item return policy, which leaves me hesitant to order another one in its place.<br /><br />UPDATE - 5/18/13<br /><br />After receiving a prompt and courteous response from Anker's Customer Support staff, I decided to give the mouse another chance.  Since my refund was already processed with Amazon, I ordered another with the reimbursement.  The second time was a charm.  It took a little getting used to after so many years of gaming with a Logitech Trackman Wheel but the change was well worth it.  As previously reviewed, it was a perfect ergonomic fit for my hand and the features are solid.  I'm glad that I was swayed to give the product another chance.  The quality customer service made a world of difference!
B00AMBH70S|2.0|it starts off nice and strong and then just withers away to a toothless movie.  You have to wait an hour for a cool chase scene and really STUPID end.  He doesn't even get to kiss the girl!  What a waste of a beautiful face on both accounts
0756407915|5.0|I can't wait for #3. This book went everywhere with me. One of those, just one more chapter and you wake up in bed at 3 a.m. with a stiff neck.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|The classic 70s music doesn't work in the beginning.  When he reached for an iphone I thought it was an anachronism.  The preachy undertone is a bit much
B0001O3YD0|5.0|That says it all. Because this says I need more words, here they are. The third Riddick is on my must see list.
B00CDSVZHY|2.0|WTF<br />Nothing like Inglorious Bastards<br />Weird random attempt at funny with the hoods scene is incongruent<br />WTF how many times do you need to say the N word  before it looses its shock value
0446572985|5.0|Lead character is fascinating as are all the characters. The book keeps you reading, the story is well told and interesting. Recommend it highly.
B00B7FW6U4|2.0|totally NOT scary and sooooo stupid<br />wish it was a worthy addition to the other films<br />dont waste your money
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Action from start to finish with this book!  Had me not wanting to put the book down at all!  I was sad that Egwene didnt make it but this series was not definitely not a &#34;happily ever after&#34; type series anyway.<br /><br />In my opinion Brandon did a very good job at finishing the series out.  I think Robert Jordan would have been proud!
0425252868|5.0|A fine historical narrative, I could not put this book down, read it in two days and immediately recommended it to several friends.  Written well enough that casual readers used to different genres will be enthralled, yet factual and sincere enough to satisfy even the most pedantic anorak.  I am looking forward to following this author.
B00003CXFV|5.0|Gives one Hope.  Shows the way.  Displays the power of determination in a entertaining and educating way.<br />Will watch again as this is so full of content.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Bonamassa really delivers on this cd. The blues sound is great, every selection on this cd is a gem. You will not be dissapointed.
B00080ZG10|5.0|Very understandable this won so many awards.  Will watch again as this is so full with information, History,  and enjoyable as well.<br />We Need more Movies such as this.  Will also give as gifts.  May YOU enjoy as much as all those who watched with me and count me too Please.
B008BU75IQ|1.0|I thought this was a trilogy. If so the ending was terrible! Also too much government which I didn't understand, and Seb's sister was never told she was his sister.  First two were great. This was advertised as a trilogy. Even if there is another book I don't think I'll be buying it.
B000C65Z20|5.0|Now it is understandable why so many  of our very bright minded people do and be  as they are.<br />This was recommended to me,  can only pass that on to  who ever reads this. recommend this for all.
B00138CYD4|5.0|Awesome album, like the variety of  performers. Music really moves you<br />and  the guitar sounds are still the best ever.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|We need to be informed and this does that.  So well Delivered with the truth in a perfect medium.  Would want all to see.  Have watched it several times and get more each time. Its a good gift.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|It is a fun game to have. It takes up allot of space. Thanks for the price drop. Very cool game. You should get it.
B004GYY714|4.0|Easy to work within, good selection of stations. makes it easy to find music you are in the mood to listen to. I like being able to have favorite stations and also recent station for reference. You can also listen to news,  events, just search and you will find something to enjoy. I have this on my phone to listen with earplugs outdoors while gardening as a change from my iPod. I used to live on the other coast so it is fun for me to listen to stations from that area but there are also stations around the world as well better than a previous app and much better than iHeart radio app.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I think it is a heartwarming beautiful creation. God has given the author a true gift. I loved this book
B00935KWWO|2.0|Extremely limited in functionality so I deleted it. I could not see the full tweet or status updates unless I left the app and also to reply or respond so why bother? And although I set the app to stream updates it still required me to drag to show the newest.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The end was somewhat predictable. It did flow well. I could write a better novel. In fact, I am doing that now.
B000OIZUW6|5.0|I loved this book.  As with all of Ken Follett's  work I could not put it down and read the book in less than a week.  Can't wait for my next book by this wonderful author. Suzzanne
1452113432|5.0|Couldn't wait so bought it at almost twice the cost at a local bookstore. It was WORTH IT!! I'm a foodie to say the least. Even taken some professional cooking class and yet I find this book not only entertaining, recipes in it are relatively short and preparation easy. Some complained about ingredients not available? Well I have no problem finding them. Okay so you have to know what \\"lardon\\" is but she tells you what it is, smoked bacon. Could substitute canadian bacon if you want.<br /><br />Classics like boeuf bourguignon is simple. Ingredient list looks intimidating but it really isn't I've seen much longer list with method lot more complicated.<br /><br />Other interesting dishes Poulet au citron et lavande, poulet aux champignons... are really easy and really good.<br /><br />She also shows some of the more interesting cooking method such as en papillote. Literally cook your dinner in parchment paper. So no mess to clean up. Just wad the paper up and into trash. Typicaly en papillote is with fish and she chose to do with trout. you could substitute salmon or even rockfish, cod, sole, flounder, cat fish too if you want. I would use even good quality carp with its mild delicate flavor.<br /><br />If nothing else enjoy the great photography!! And see her youtube video. She'll make you happy and smile!!<br /><br />lardon substitute: canadian bacon or smoked bacon of some sort decide which one according to your taste.<br />Creme Fraiche can be found at Trader Joe. Chevre cheese also at Trader Joe's...<br /><br />Mussel steamed in wine is another classic. simple yet so good. Puff pastry, chouquette, is easy but will make you look like a professional cook. Another classic millefeuille is rustic and simple yet looks like a million bucks and decidedly decadent.<br /><br />BUY THIS BOOK!!
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I have avast on my home computer and for a free service it work's great! So I added it on my Kindle Fire and I hope it does the same as it does on the home desk top. You can buy more with it for a reasonable price but I like the free part!
B002SR2PKG|4.0|It took me many (20) years to be able to read this book  ... I am finally adult enough to be able to digest & enjoy this book without intense anxiety & childhood fear.  Stephen King has an amazing way with words
0143038419|5.0|I bought this for my Fiance while i was deployed.  She liked it and was glad i bought it for her.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|It was great rewatching this season as I missed a few episodes watching it at friend's houses.  I can't stop watching the Doctor explore himself.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Clancy is back to his old form...assuming he actually wrote this work. Whatever...still very, very entertaining. I hope he is working on his next piece.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Fun to watch these guys plow through dreamlands and wastelands as easily as we could go about our daily lives.
0385486804|5.0|Great story of a boy that just wanted to be a part of nature the way it was intended. Nothing not to like.
193700788X|2.0|I want to start off by saying that I have been a devoted fan of the Sookie Stackhouse novels for many years.  I have read through the series so many times I have lost count.  So thank you, Charlaine, for creating the world of Sookie Stackhouse as it has brought me countless hours of joyful reading.  This final book, however, has forever tainted the entire series for me.  I really wished I could un-read Dead Ever After and then make up my own ending, one that feels authentic to the characters and storylines.  I feel cheated, betrayed and left with a feeling of having lost something that was dear and special to me.  I am heartbroken and angry.<br /><br />I don't want to re-hash the reasons why this final book was less than stellar.  I agree with most all the other one and two star reviews.  This series could have been legendary and now it's overshadowed by a conclusion the author should be ashamed of.  A slap in the face, a kick in the rear.  Charlaine, I hope it was worth it losing at least 50% of your readership.  Well, you may not care since we have all made you a very rich woman and you'll be fine financially if you never sold another book again, but you broke the unwritten contract between author and reader.<br /><br />Let me be clear, I am not upset over who Sookie chose in the end, but I am stunned by how poorly it was executed.  Like the majority of the readers, I am an Eric lover and I was disgusted by how Charlaine eviscerated this larger than life character.
B00C2VGAW2|5.0|I absolutely loved the music! It went great with the movie and made it more up to date kinda movie rather than a boring long one. I'm happy with what the did!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I thought this was a very endearing story and loved the ending.  Heart breaking in parts but enjoyable in spite of that.
B0033TJATW|5.0|Finally moonwalker has been released on DVD.  Loved it on VHS.  But its even better now.  Classic Michael Jackson, enjoyable from start to finish.
1608871452|5.0|Bought this for my daughter and she loves it, now the other daughter wants one as well! I should have just bought 2 to start with!
0525478817|5.0|I would have to say this is one of the best books I have read. There is something so real and raw about it. It is a book about love, and cancer, and finding yourself, and being true to yourself. It is told in such a real way that I laughed, and cried, and just felt like I really KNEW the characters. Definitely a must read for any age.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|Terrific story, excellent cast, well-paced, damn good movie. Brad Cooper keeps improving as an actor. Jennifer Lawrence blows me away. Her genuine-ness coupled with natural acting skill while so young - WOW!
0316228532|2.0|I got this for someone durning the Christmas season, they claim they can't read very much of it, and still haven't finished the book yet.  Being a massive Harry Potter fan, I thought the writing would still have the same pull, but I guess it didn't.  Makes me a little sad, but I'm sure she will jump back.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I read this book because I had read Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn and really liked it. This book was really great as well. I couldn't put it down. I was in suspense and guessing until the end!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Book with happy ending.  Drama mixed with sadness and happy events. Main characters are likeable. Short and sweet.  I like it!
B005K17RU0|4.0|This Could Have Been A Five Star.<br />This App Is Easy To Use And Has Some Features. It Has Video, News, Maps And Yes Even Weather! I Use This On A Toshiba Thrive, Android Operating System
B00CL66FEQ|4.0|Barbra is much funnier than I expected! She doesn't just play an annoying mother. Not as many cliches as I feared, solid plot. A really nice movie.
B009NX88JU|5.0|A classic movie to watch with friends.  This has always been a favorite movie of mine, I can't help but watch it.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It's an okay game I love playing it all the time her good free game also it's a great hits with the kids
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|WILLY GETS BETTER AS HE AGES.  IT IS A BEAUTIFUL ALBUM AND I HAVE RECOMMENDED IT TO ALL MY FRIENDS.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This game is everything they say it is.  Very entertaining and lots of fun to play.  Great design that keeps you fully engaged.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I bought this album a few days days after learning about Lindsey Stirling.  She is extremely talented and her music is from the heart and is intoxicating (in a good way).  Haven't stopped listening to it in over a week.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Great story. Was disappointed on the last book, I didn't like how it turn out to be. I already had a different view on the events and how the plot and climax of the story was going to be but it definitely caught me off guard. Hopefully the movies do not disappoint.
B004W2UBYW|3.0|This is an interesting biography about a complicated man who had a definite affect on the technology business.  It seemed to me, though it wasn't mentioned, that Steve had Aspergers.  It explains much of his social ineptness.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I want the second one! Do they have it? I love these kinds of games! Better than the ispy or where's also any day
B0060AY7A8|4.0|Another novel, like Hope, that deals with the bigotry in the Southern U.S.A. as well as returning veterans and some of the problems they face.  It's well done.
1451695195|5.0|we just lost our daughter(4-3-13) and a cousin recommended the book for us to read and it did help us as we know we will be with our daughter some day. What he wrote was very enlightening . It was different from other books I read years ago.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This was a very easy to read book with such great story she is an inspiration, I could not put it down
B0035XVVDY|4.0|There is a lot of dialogue between the two main characters.  In between there is a lot of action. This is a very good movie.
B001VIMCW4|3.0|Its typical and forgettable, and I have been a long term Bond fan. The story-line is old too: another super-bad, super-powerful, uber-wealthy villainous organization/ villain. Not bad, it's just ordinary.
0143123173|5.0|The new television series LONGMIRE led me to the written series and I'm so glad it did.  Love the TV series, which does the books and the characters justice, but do read the books if you get the chance--there's so much that is suggested on the show, but is developed very satisfactorily in the books.  I am an avid reader and this is the best book I've read in years.  Described as a mystery, but it is rich in plot, character, humor, humanity.  Literary in pleasing ways, as the title suggests, but a down-to-earth look at down-to-earth lives.  Presents a close and pleasing look at the ways and spirituality of the American Indian, which fits seamlessly into the plot.  A must read!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very good it can push you to really focus but it is sill amazing to play so there you go
B00005R2IS|4.0|Good movie which I think introduced Mel Gibson outside Australia. Good stunt work and bizarre villains which sets the stage for the future movies.
B001O6W9QC|4.0|A bit high concept (relatively) compared to a lot of Stiller flicks, and it definitely benefits from this. Great production values and performances. Dark, but not too dark humor.
B0014Z4ON4|5.0|I thought I had seen this movie previous to purchasing the DVD.  I was pleasantly surprised that I had never seen it and certainly enjoyed watching the well paced and interesting movie.
B003RV43X4|3.0|CoT is a classic film and as with all classic films you have to be careful when you take liberties with the story. In my opinion, there were too many plot changes for me to really like this movie. If you've never seen the original, then you may enjoy it for the action. I definitely think the story itself took a step back. I struggled to give it 3 stars, but felt it deserved somewhat higher than 2. I won't go into the details because they may discourage someone for at least giving it a go once, but I will say keep your expectations low and don't expect much!
B000BISBDY|5.0|this was purchased as a present for my son, he said it was a very good album, he is a Johnny Cash fan.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|It was listed under Christian bestsellers, but it is clearly not Christian. It is occultish. The book was well-written and I believe his encounter was genuine, but he encountered something other than heaven.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I really enjoy this game as it is simple and doesn't require any particular skill to play.  I often have trouble sleeping because my mind is running in twenty different directions, so I sometimes play Mahjong at 4::00 a.m. It's very relaxing and helps to get my mind off my worries!
0307291650|5.0|This book was a great price for 3 hardcover novels put together, the edge of the paper is gold trim and the cover material is thick and embossed.  One of the nicest looking book in my collection.  The books themselves were amazing, just like the rest of the vampire series.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|At first I was leery of buying a &#34;book&#34; that had no print edition yet. Read the reviews and decided to give it a go. Great. Choice! I read it quickly on my Kindle, and got the second series called Shift. As a fan of post-apocalyptic fiction, I loved the story, got into the world of the silo, and eagerly followed the action. I liked that the characters were not fully described, so I got to think more about them instead of  just being told about them.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I enjoyed the movie for a few reasons - the acting was superb, the music was amazing, and the casting was right on.  The show kept my attention - how could it not?  There was some kind of explosive drama every few minutes.  The thing that bothers me is that I feel a show like this about a subject as touchy as slavery, and with the way it was portrayed, can only cause a certain facet of either race to become enraged.  Slavery was wrong, no doubt about it, but we made our mistakes and now have tried to right the wrongs that generations before committed.  We're trying to move ahead and become a community of people who can coexist.  This subject matter has been addressed plenty of times before, only to create even more racial tension.  I believe we've made amends.  We have a black president, don't we?  When you really assess a movie, you usually have to address how you feel afterward.  I say again, I thoroughly enjoyed the acting, the music, and the scenery, but was somewhat insulted that every white American in the show was demonized.
B00CHILW64|2.0|While the subject of this story - human response in the face of powerful natural forces - is of course interesting, the acting leaves much to be desired. Too often it seemed rather canned; not quite believable - though it did get somewhat better further into the movie. Also, the plot seemed predictable and the characters a bit cliched.<br /><br />If someone were tempted to watch this film - as were my wife and I - then do it to stir the imagination about what it might be like to be in the middle of a natural disaster, especially in a context where those around you might not speak your tongue. Further, if you are from a more developed part of the world, you might think about the additional medical and emergency relief challenges that you might face in a developing country should there be something like a tsunami. (However, even more developed countries do not always provide stellar responses in such situations.)
B008LD09LS|4.0|Great app for controlling the quad-copter.  Besides flight controls, it has links to videos, manuals and other nifty stuff.  Only problem I have had is when I fly it from my POV, it has left and right reversed.  Takes some getting used to, but it works.
B00969PR18|5.0|It is the best pan that I ever used. My cakes come out beautifull every time. I would recommend it highly.
B0063M22QO|3.0|Just the same old Mahjong game.  Not sure what I expected, but it is the same game I played 10 years ago on my PC.
B009Y7YC2M|1.0|This app doesn't even work on my kindle. It was a waste of money. Do not purchase this app, unless you want a complete RIP OFF! I'd give this app zero stars if I could.
B00AEJM6H2|1.0|after game  downloaded a box popped up and said it could not be installed because &quot;file is corrupt&quot;!!??!?!!<br />guess I need to notify 'iTreeGamer' staff...<br />if this gets fixed I will be glad to resubmit another review and if it works like its supposed too...ill give 5 stars because I love the game!!<br />*(submitted by: Rhonda.Kinchen via Scott.Hollis' K.F. )*
B000HL09MG|1.0|I didn't realize that it was about sex and drugs.  I only watched 10 minutes and I had seen enough
B00CELB980|1.0|Depeche Mode's choice of remixers is sad. I've heard better fan remixes on the internet!<br />I thought that with such a great track as \\"Soothe My Soul\\" the remixes would be up to par; unfortunately they are as mediocre as ever.<br /><br />I guess it's time to stop buying the official singles and build my own out of fan remixes on the internet instead.
B008602KQI|4.0|I heard a lot about the book and movie.  I wanted to see what all the excitement was about.  Acting was good.
B005D63ICI|5.0|The 5th season of dexter has to be one of my favorite seasons of Dexter. I wish there would be more seasons.
B00BS1VVIU|5.0|BUY THIS ALBUM. NOW. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. IF YOU LIKE MUSIC THIS ALBUM IS FOR YOU SO GET IT!!!
B0037B6QSY|4.0|4 stars.  This book helps you meditate in very creative ways. It is well written.  It uses sound psychology and science.  It connects to daily life.  I highly recommend it.

B005F3XV62|5.0|it arrived very promptly and we didn't have any problems w/ it, I was really impressed...would buy again(: great movie
B001RIY49C|5.0|Great set. Made nicely! Looks great on my dresser! Would buy more sets from this manufacturer. This was everything I expected!
B0084B1T8Y|4.0|This book held me over for at least a month or so because I didn't want it to be over so I read it at least four times. You should be quite satisfied!
B007SGLZP8|1.0|Very slow moving with no characters to 'relate to or root for.  Not realistic at all, the weakest Grisham I've ever read.  May keep me away from this author for quite a while.  I do not recommend this book.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|The book was great, one of the best books I have ever read, I loved the Red Pryamid, good book
B009NY43NY|4.0|It was good but I expected more for the final book. It felt like charlaine Harris just didn't care and hastily threw the story together . I am however happy about a few character paths . The end  didn't bring me  closer.
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|None of us could pull ourselves away and not be moved by this family's saga. The re-creation of the disaster was extraordinary and the actors were so believeable.
B007IK44CK|4.0|If you liked the other MI films you will really like this one .Plot is quite complicated with twists and turns throughout .
B009FZHYKU|5.0|an awesome series.  I just have OTA digital, stopped sending money to cable company a decade ago.  Rarely miss it, but not having AMC meant had to look fro a way to get these shows - Amazon did it.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book has been many things.  It was for the most part enlightening, in that it made me reconsider my approach to my own adventure.  I found it inspiring in the terms that were used to consider one a genius.  Hearing about teslas hardship and considering it against my own was encouraging. This writer can truly be contagious with the writing.  The book was an easy read and it offered so many secrets to a life of happiness and success.
0393316041|5.0|Feinman was deeply involved in the science of space and nuclear physics, and there has never in my experience been such a wonderful self-criticizing and hilarious autobiographer!
1451613512|1.0|Everyone knows that Stone has an agenda and is a rabid Marxist.  Don't even bother reading the book - use your imagination to think of what he would publish.<br /><br />God Bless America!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is pure DRAMA! It's like the Gossip Girl  of the early 1900s and I love it! Give it a try.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|It's one of the best Daft punk songs I've heard in years. I hope the rest of the album is this good.
193700788X|5.0|Loved IT!!!!<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book.  It was fun and I thank the author for making one more.  I know there has been some negativity written about the book and I really can't see why.  I guess it is a kind of complement to Harris that she wrote a character that so many feel so passionate about.<br /><br />To tell you the truth I hope she changes her mind and in 3 or 4 years goes back to Bon Temps.<br /><br />Thank you again it was really fun.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|So the long journey ends.<br />I loved each book book in the series anxiously awaiting over the years as each new one was released and fearful that the tale wouldn't come to and ending with the untimely death of Robert Jordan. Now that the final book is done completed by Brandon Sanderson based on Robert Jordan's unfinished manuscript and guidelines I Find myself both happy and sad at the stories end.<br />There are no endings, to the turning of the Wheel of Time.<br /><br />But it was an ending.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|This was a good series to watch, although some what predictable.  But since I had 24 hours in the air on a long international trip, this helped make the plane ride go by faster!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I like it, it is look like Flipboard almost, but flexible more. It is more better for me for now.
1848775873|5.0|what a quirky tale of a little visitor who views the world differently, is curious about unexpected things, is polite and quiet but doesnt act like the family he stays with. he is adorable as illustrated and endearing in his curiosities. He leaves an unforgetable impression on the family when he leaves, and perhaps on the reader as well. i will be checking out more by this author.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|Basically a revised Civil War era version of Rambo.  Some entertaining parts overshadowed by the completey ridiculous action scenes that made many of todays over the top action movies look tame in comparison.
1451697686|1.0|This was the funniest book I read so far this year! The author is crazy! She recommends composting your tampons! She does say that wiping your behind with your hand may not be the best thing to do, even if they do it in other countries. Well, thank you for THAT anyway...<br />I originally picked this screed up because I thought it might have a few good money-saving ideas, instead, it is full of elitest, environmental feel-goodisms! Oh, I can just see going to my local grocery with a bunch of jars and a pillowcase...PULEEZE!!!<br />I swear, don't these people even KNOW anyone in the real (not liberal-land California) world!! How anyone could take this woman seriously I cannot understand...<br />Only read if you want a good laugh and to be a bit grossed out.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This mahjong has alot of different games and different levels to challenge you what ever your mood could be at the time you are playing
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Really enjoyed this one. I liked the story line and the characters as well. I want more like this. Thank you.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|All the old products based on Firewire as external hard drives and even advanced video controllers came alive by connecting with the new Retina Macs!
B00499QUK2|5.0|Excellent stories, acting and picture!  I watched season two as well and wonder if there is a 3? Sherlock and Watson are wonderful
B008ALAHA4|2.0|The product is OK and covers it's purpose, but the quality is not good. When you pulls the cable all parts come out and is disarmed very easily.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is minecraft but the only thing is that it is not the same as as real minecraft you can't go in the end or nether
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this season. Each one gets better and better. Characters more interesting and more complex this season. Love the history of it all.
B001NKI60W|5.0|Wanted to see it for a long time and so glad we finally had the chance!  So fun, well acted, and loved all the music...just the thing to get your mood in a happy place!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I enjoyed this book. I am glad that J Grisham has gone back to his old way of writing. It's been a while since I've read him. I ALMOST got mad at the hero because I didn't know where the ending was headed and at one time tried very hard NOT to skip to the end. WHAT A SURPRISE. Will probably read again.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I own several sleep apps this one is by far the best one out there . You mix and match the sounds that you can relax, meditate ,or fall into a nice peaceful sleep. My favorite signed for myself is the whales taking and singing,then I put thunderstorms,night,frog,.this is my perfect go to slope sound. Get this app and find your perfect sound blend. App comes with a timer and a couple of other extras .This is the perfect app. Thank you app makers all the best sleep to those who buy this it is so worthy .99 cents
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Couldn't be happier.  Works great.  Able to zoom through pages and it connects me instantly to my other google related sites.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is an awesome app. And would Definately recommend it to any person who enjoys the reading the teachings of the bible.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|A staple in modern zombie lore. As important to fans of the new undead as George A. Rom and his movies themselves.
B004TI1WME|2.0|Decent as a calculator and the tape works well and I'd absolutely love it if it weren't for the fact that it doesn't function like an actual office calculator would. The plus and minus keys should apply to the previous number, e.g., &quot;20 + 30 + 40 -&quot; should result in 10, not 90.
1609611543|5.0|A good factual review of the hazards of the basic foods everyone consumes.  There is milk and wheat sensitivity in my family, so the information was timely and very helpful.  I have changed my diet as a result of the information gained.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|THE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE APPS I RECOMEND IT TO EVERYONE ITS STARTS SLOW BUT IT GETS B E TTER AS YOU GO ON THROUGH THE GAME
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I like Tina Fey. Fun and silly. It is a nice change from deep, disturbing biographies of others. If you want to just relax and giggle, then I highly recommend it.
B00BXLU1EU|5.0|World great just like it says in the description is hard sometimes to hack the password when it has symbols and letters
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Love this diet.  It really works and it's so easy to follow.  I recommend it to anyone interested in losing a few pounds.
B00932AA5G|4.0|Surprised on the story line. It really is a different kind of movie. Really enjoyed it. It is better that a lot of the movies I've seen lately. I would definitely recommend it.
B00CFITJKW|3.0|I would like to see tilt controls and maybe even flaps speed break etc.its a good game could use some work
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great science fiction and human drama. I must say I was very sad when I finished the last book. I want more. Definitely buy the whole series.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Was slow at first but picked up towards the middle of the book. The ending was surprising and had a lot of emotions to go along with it
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book because it had an interesting plot line and many surprises. It was a fun read.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This story was very good.  It caught my attention because it made me remember a lot of the things in my past.  Good and bad.  I. Remembered when I first met my husband 43 years ago and. How easily things can slip away from us, how we need to face all that has happened and let each other know how much we love and care about each.  We need to show the same kindness and consideration to each other as we do to strangers because in the end we only have each other.
B005DJREJS|1.0|My 13 year old was excited to watch this because all her friends &#34;love it&#34;, as she said. Imagine my surprise when, within 10 minutes of the beginning, the main character was happy to be losing her virginity to a guy she hadn't even dated in a closet at summer day camp. Wow. It's hard to believe any parent would approve of their child watching this. What has happened to any standards of morality or decency for young girls in our culture? It is a constant battle to raise a daughter who respects herself and has a healthy view of sex because of these kind of shows. It's not funny. It's tragic. All I can say is don't watch this show and DON'T let your children or teens watch this show. It should not be titled &#34;Awkward&#34;. It should be titled &#34;Awful&#34;.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very fun and addictive game.  You get to groom and feed your horse, enter it in competitions, give it lessons, and even more really fun stuff. I highly recommend this app!
B003NTSBUG|5.0|Bought as a Christmas present for my son. He loves it! Watched it several times, movie was in good condition.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|If you loved Gone Girl, this one is just as good! Creepy, disturbing, psychological, couldn't put it down until it was finished!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I live this game.its very addicting and I play it all day long. Be sure to invite your friends and view their park.
B004TN7QPG|5.0|I'm not that tech savvy & I'm finding it hard to navigate through certain books or import downloads into the library. There are some features I like. The ability to highlight content in 4 different colors is cool. Overall not sure I needed this.<br />Update: okay now that I know how to use it, through trial and error, it's awesome and has become the place I open just about everything I down load.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This is just the kind of book I felt like reading, light and entertaining. Thanks I look forward to the third book.
B000TEPL92|5.0|How easy is this?  Too easy....  Can't beat this price anywhere....An entire album of MP3 songs put into my cloud player and I can download them to any desktopo I want at any time....  SImply AMAZING!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game soooo much. My mom wouldn't let me get it on my PC so I got this and it was better than I expected!
B008KOMMTA|5.0|I'm a HUGE Titanic Fan and this just made my Day!<br />This edition is awesome for any collector out there.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I am wondering how the series is going to end. I like the suspense and the unpredictability of the various episodes.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I really like being able to wake up to beautiful soft tones instead of a blast of noise.  I like the Good Morning and Mountain the best.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I like this game its not bad but the assistant is annoying I wish they would fix that. but other then that its good
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The granddaughter of one of my sisters friends was over and wanted to play on my kindle. Since I have no children or grandchildren, I let her pick a free game and this was it. She knew the game and it intertained her until Grandma was ready to leave.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I downloaded this app to download Youtube videos. but I never used the app.  This is why I gave the rating of three stars.  After I have used it for some time I will try to reevaluate these comments.
B008QPCCQQ|5.0|Always loved Ms Alcott's writings. This is alot of material in one location for a very cheap price. (You can obtain each novel separately for free, but this puts them all in one convenient spot.)<br />I recently took it with me on vacation.  While enjoying the present relaxation, reminded myself of childhood hours of reading pleasure.<br />There are layers and levels in Ms Alcott's books that few modern writers can match.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I got this because it was stated to be similar to Temple Run.  This game is a lot more challenging to play then Temple Run.  There was not enough explanation of how to play the game as I would have liked.  As with all games that are free, you are constantly tempted to purchase more coins so that the game will last longer, be more enjoyable, and you can actually feel like you are making progress in the game.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|This camera flash works well, and I have no complaints as far as functionality. I know other reviewers have had problems with the battery door breaking or something along those lines. I have purchased two so far. The first one I purchased 1 year ago because I was wary of the door being flimsy, but as of today after a year of weddings and senior portraits, everything is functioning properly with no problems. I just placed my order for a second speedlight for my second camera.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this app and would recommend it to anyone. Very user friendly and fun to play. Really like the one tap feature.
B0092D1V5Y|1.0|It didn't actually work. None of the passwords were right. It just made up a random string of letters and numbers. Very disappointing.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I am so disappointed that the app doesn't work on my new Surface.  I have so many ebooks on my ipad so I have to keep up with both tablets until I finish all my books and now probably will not buy any more ebooks until I find a good ereader for the surface.  I hope someone will fix this soon!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|THIS IS A FANTASTIC APP, IT lets me acutely keeps track of the battery level when I'am watching YOU TUBE OR any orther online video content.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was a great one! I sure hope Jeff Kinney keeps up the good work! Its really good love this series
B0079TQHDO|5.0|I've been an Archer fan for 30 years and have never been disappointed. I can't wait for the next installment!
B0099114WO|5.0|We both enjoyed the film. The acting is superb as these two always are. A good addition to the library.
B00006LFGD|5.0|well done and features many popular songs.  Quality of the audio is very good and the level is held at the same level.  You will enjoy owning this one.
B001OG3VOQ|5.0|I was looking for new music to complement my current collection. This Alanis album fits right in and the music was exactly what I was looking for.
0738212415|5.0|This was the best investment I've made in my new drawing endeavors. I am totally amazed at how quickly I learned so much. My brother who's a &#34;real&#34; artist unlike me, a wannabe, was blown away and could not believe my &#34;eye&#34; drawing. He kept asking saying, &#34;You drew this?!?&#34;  I am so excited and encouraged to continue my quest to learn more. I've wanted to draw more than stickmen for over 50 years and now my drawings are actually recognizable and realistic  And I have to give total credit to Mark Kistler for my progress!  Thank you, Mark, for making my dream come true!  If you are a total beginner, get this book. It really TEACHES you skills, step-by-step, and builds your ability and confidence. I purchased several other similar books, but none are as good as Mark's. Some go into theory too much and are pretty boring.  Others don't really show/teach you how to get from point A to point B. They pretty much explain some things, then just show you their own drawings, the end result, but not HOW to get there!  Mark takes you through 30 lessons which i finished in 20 days because it was so much fun!  Get this book!  You won't regret it!
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|I dunno why I downloaded this stupid free game, what was I thinking? Oh wait I think I was a little drunk when I downloaded this, yep that's why. No worries, I already un-installed it from my kindle fire, yay!
B009NY43NY|3.0|CH's writing was not as comfortably read in this book. The plot required a lot of reworked facts and awkward story lines.<br />I get why it ended this way, but readers should have had  more time to get used to the idea. Oh well, it is time to move on.  I enjoyed  most of my time in Bon Temps.
B006M4F67A|3.0|I gave this three stars because I don't know why. I only downloaded this free app just hoping to get a free MP3 song credit added to my amazon balance.
B001P4ESGC|5.0|I love Damages, just when you think you know what is going to happen it goes the other way.The stars are great in Damages.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|Instead of downloading this game, download the free JAWS movie based mobile game version, I downloaded it on my android phone, its way more fun and hilarious than this version. Plus there is no JAWS theme song on this Hungry Shark DE-volution
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|I did not like this movie.  I did however, love its look and feel.  It is beautiful to look at but boring with a plot that is weak.
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|I am going to be honest, I only downloaded this app because it was free and I was told I could get a free MP3 song credit added to my amazon account. Turns out that it was a lie! Anyways, I'm hungry, let's get a taco.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book that really keeps you on your toes reading. Look forward to the next one and to see what happens.
B00AQM8H9I|3.0|How dare you steal my fish, I caught that fish fair and square! I was hoping to eat some trout fish tonight!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Awesome physics for tablet/phone<br />Graphics are great<br />It's like a portable call of duty it almost reminds me of a Nintendo 64 first person shooter
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Excellent job with casting, and sets.  Very dark, maybe better in the theater? Made me interested in learning more about the Civil War and Lincoln
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Its so awesome you can literally make any kind of plague whether it transmits  via air/water/birds/ species/insects/livestock or all of them create a simple fever or an all out bursting tumor-cyst, coma inducing, organ failing plague that will be the world ender
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Much like most other match 3 games.  Good, mindless way to relax.  Nice graphics. Lots like Bejeweled and Bejeweled 2
B0063GORYU|5.0|have always liked this game. it is a great addition to my tablet. And i can take it anywhere. Had no problems downloading it.
B0001I55NS|4.0|Really enjoyed the story and the concept.  Time travel interests me so I liked this movie.  Liked it better than the book
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids love this game.  It works great on the Kindle.  This is a must have if you have kids and want to keep them quiet while waiting for a doctors appt.  :o)
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Fast moving and compelling story, well written with the exception of finale. Why get obtuse in the end? I will read again.
B004EPZ084|5.0|A wonderful comedy that almost anyone can relate to.<br />It's a film that I would recommend to anyone who holds a job.
B00280LYHS|5.0|It just keeps getting better and better!!!! I love reading about the adventures of Percy, Annabeth, Grover, and now Rachel.
B000002UZ4|4.0|Although not a popular group, some of their songs were<br />never really appreciated as they should have been.<br />Good music!!
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|I have shared this movie with friends and they share it with friends and so I had to buy another one because the first one hasn't come back yet.  This movie has a positive impact on many college age students.
B00003CXRM|2.0|Considering the cast, the movie is weak with little adventure.<br />A few humorous parts but all in all a dud.
1616960922|5.0|This is a great story about an interesting topic with a novel world and magic system.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.
B002VECMAO|3.0|Considering the cast, it's not as good as I expected.<br />Lots of dull moments and not the action I anticipated.
B00BESLHEA|1.0|Definitely deserves a 1-star rating.  The movie trailer hyped up this movie so much into believing it would be a &#34;Kill Bill&#34; -esque movie, but ended up very disappointing.  The movie tries really hard to be a revenge, action movie, but is so confusing that the viewer is left frustrated.  I watched this movie with two other friends and they had the same expression.  Good job RZA.  Way to ruin my get together.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|A great film with a great cast.<br />Plenty of action with a bit of love thrown into the mix.<br />Highly recommended!
B007MDQW3W|4.0|Not her best, but very fun. Each song is a mini story. But I kind of miss the songs where she has something overt to say.
0767830555|5.0|I believe this was De Niro's first starring movie.<br />Also a glimpse of the master, Martin Scorsese.<br />A bit on the bloody side but way before its time.<br />I believe it was made in 1972?
0765334798|1.0|Too ambitious and not carried out well. Even with better logic behind it it could have been summed up in a novella or short story - not a novel. It was too long.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|it was awesome i really enjoyed it read it if you like a good story and adventure highly recommend it
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Kept my attention that I could hardly put the game down.  Can't wait for the next version.<br />Worth the price.
B00846REIS|4.0|I got whiplash reading this book! A ton of ups and down and then flipped around on top your head! While the content is HOT, the characters are SO flawed I'm not sure if they will ever get it together. Don't get me wrong, I will be purchasing the sequel when I get home but I could do with a little of all the drama.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is very addicting.  Love it when the cop catches up to you and holds you by your foot.  Very good game.
B009NY43NY|5.0|i'll admit, after i heard all the negative reviews that people were sprouting about this -- how the ending wasn't what people wanted, etc -- i was a bit apprehensive to read this last book in the Sookie series. i shouldn't have been. It's a completely enjoyable, fun read. and while the ending may not be what every Sookie fan wants, nor expects, I was happy with it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A great game for passing time. It truly kept my brain engaged the entire time. Everyone needs to try it!
B001URCM44|5.0|Yanni, what else is there to say?  He is a master with no equal.  I simply love all he does.
B009O5CLZY|4.0|This app is great but in order to get new items it costs a ton of money and its hard to earn coins without buying them :/ other than that it's great
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Not what I expected.  Had trouble playing it.  The graphics were nice though.  It was somewhat relaxing just looking at all the colors
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Jack Reacher is about the most tenacious Avenging Angel a friend could have.  With few clues and a desire to set the record straight, Reacher is once again into the fray.  Those that like loyalty, tenacity, vengeance and wry justice will love this Lee Child novel.  It's a great read and a great plot that will keep you up late at night trying to stay ahead of Reacher and his friends.  Five stars for this one!
B00849F82E|4.0|Though Chesterton's prose style was a bit difficult to fathom, his views on Catholicism were certainly thought-provoking.  Our book discussion group spent three hours puzzling over his views and reasoning.  I would definitely recommend it for people who really want to have their thinking challenged.
1579128149|3.0|Most elements get two pages; 75% pictures and 25% text. Many of the pictures are beautiful. However, the text is very anecdotal, but it also tries to be funny in a geeky way. I enjoy flipping through the book. If you want a picture book about the elements, this is a great book that can be enjoyed by both older children and adults. Since that is such a niche audience I cannot give the book more than three stars.<br /><br />If you want a book without pictures I can recommend [[ASIN:0061824739 Periodic Tales: A Cultural History of the Elements, from Arsenic to Zinc]] instead. You'll learn more about the history and social significance about many (but not all) of the elements. However, just be aware that these two book are not really books about chemistry.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Denzel probably made a lot of pilots and anyone with a public safety job take a look at themselves in the mirror after watching this one.
0385344333|4.0|We enjoy this series.  This one is pretty typical.  Sure hared to come up with a lot of words for me.
1405304677|5.0|I love it, fountain of helpful info. Very useful resource and I would highly recommend this book for any one in need to educate themselves on this topic.
B007HACDLK|4.0|This was not as good as Flynn's other books. I had a hard time reading it.  The other books I did not want to put down.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|This was a gift for my Sister in Law and she has always loved this movie. It is fun to sit and watch it on a weekend visit with a good cup of tea.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Just plain all around fun.  Great DVD.  Only sad thing is no real extras.  The cast is wonderful.  And I love RDJr!
B00COHAUD4|4.0|It was good visually and started off with a bang! Great suspense/horror movie ;) Get it if you are ready for a pillow over the eyes kind of night!
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Great DVD.  Wonderful movie!  Great extras, planning on watching again and again.  If you are a fan of the Lord of the Rings movies, you need this!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Great movie! I would watch it over and over again... it just keeps your brain thinking after the movie is over for hours and hours. Definitely one to watch again! or maybe even buy :P Can easily relate it to your own life ;)
B00CH87HF4|5.0|this game is so cool . I have been caught playing the game at work and love it. best way to pass the time.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|Gota see this movie if you are looking to go back to the gangster days in the 1950's. The best actors and actresses you could ask for and you are in for a ride if you decide to get this one! That I can assure you.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Not really sure yet how good it is I've only played it for 5 minutes, but seems so far so good. I truly enjoy hidden object games.
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|It was a good thinker movie and kept me on my feet. The end is killer and I liked how they threw a little relationship in there to mix it up a bit. I wish we would've seen that girl again in the end :P
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was deliciously amusing and a great story to follow! Exciting, riveting and all around good fun E.L James I tip my hat too you.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I really liked it, don't go to theater that often. Seeing it on video was great, want to read book now.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a very fun game. I would recommend this game to all who would want to play Bejeweled. Is just as good and just as fun and entertaining.
030758836X|4.0|This is a good psychological thriller...This type of story is scarier in some ways than hard-core horror. I know people in some very toxic relationships, so it's easy to believe this could really happen. I wasn't sure I liked the ending, but the more I think about it...it works.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Are there enough adjectives to describe such a film? If viewers are able to let go and just let the movie be itself, there are so many images and ideas floating through it that one could spend a lifetime sorting them out. The storyline seems so realistic, the close-ups of animals, the sea, the sky, facial expressions, the eyes of the . . . well, the tiger--all are part of a fantasy that someone has put before us to see. The more one reads about how the movie was made, the more there is to admire. This film is a treasure that will always hold secrets to be discovered.<br /><br />The film is rated PG; if younger children have read books containing different types of fantasy and understand that films can also be &#34;made up&#34;--although they look very real--they should be comfortable seeing the film. The peril of the ship/storm and the subsequent events are the most intense, but it helps to remind children those are &#34;imaginary.&#34;
B00BUVPIRS|4.0|I agreed with a lot you said and I spent a lot of time in the room with the acid and the blocks and even broke down and went to web, can't move the blocks. Ready to pitch my kindle fire across the room. Any suggestions?  Much thanks!
B00CL68NOG|4.0|This was a pretty decent movie considering I'm not a big fan of Streisand or Rogan.  Irony but not really a comedy.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|When I first bought this app, I really loved it.  After about a month, it stopped working.  It will not load at all.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is a lot or fun, but mostly addicting. Once you start playing you don't want to put your device down!
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|compelling true story of a great tragedy, will make you cry and be in aw of how this family survive such an ordeal ,in an event where so many thousands  of people died.
B00B8WXG9G|4.0|I HAVE BEEN ENJOYING C D . ENJOY MUSIC, SONG CHOICES AND DUET MAKERS.  HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED PAUL AND HIS SONGS HE WROTE.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|Amazing movie and perfect clarity. Watched it twice and was with every penny! A perfect mobster movie with a great ending.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|ANOTHER GREAT C D FROM MICHAEL. HE MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD WHEN YOU HEAR HIS VOICE. MAKES AN OLE LADY OF 77 WANT TO DANCE.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I prefer casual watches for daily wear, so this fit the bill pretty well.  It's comfy and fits smaller wrists well.  Keeps time well, of course.  It may run fast a minute or two over the span of a month, but that's pretty good for an automatic watch.  I think it will keep ticking for about 16-20 hours if idle.  It doesn't glow in the dark for more than a few minutes, so be aware of that if you consider that an important feature.  Having the minute/second font larger than the hour font is kind of a neat touch.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|this is a totally enjoyable show.  this is totally diverting and can be a bit addictive.  another great season from the fringe division.
B00B04KVMC|5.0|Watch the documentary, and you'll gain an instant appreciation for this album.  Getting it on vinyl seemed appropriate.  It comes with a digital download code inside, too.
B0095P3ULC|2.0|The computer graphics in this movie was very impressive, carrying on the reputation of the Transformers movies. Unfortunately, the acting was not nearly as impressive, nor was the dialogue.
1573226521|5.0|I love this book. I saw part of the movie some years ago in Puerto Rico (while traveling), later saw the whole thing, and vowed to read the book. I've since read the book twice. If you've ever backpacked (or wanted to!) in a foreign land, this book will resonate with you.<br /><br />Richard, a twenty something backpacker finds himself in Bangkok, Thailand looking for that elusive something everyone is looking for- a little authenticity. One night he meets a fellow backpacker named Daffy, who gives Richard a map to a Utopian beach hangout where a travelers community has gathered and dropped out. Also staying at the hostel are a French couple, Etienne and Francoise, who become his traveling companions.<br /><br />The book is deeply seeped in popular culture and provides a quick, fun read.<br /><br />Also for the record, I very much liked the movie of the same title starring Leonardo DiCaprio.
B00C0NFMKI|4.0|I'm a fairly dedicated Paramore fan, so I suppose I let them get away with more than a band I was on the fence about. That being said, this album isn't the same Paramore sound I've grown to love. Haley Williams isn't so much the star of the show anymore, her vocals are normalized with the music a bit more than previous albums. I also miss the melancholy, but still upbeat sound that they had. This album sounds a bit brighter overall than &#34;Riot!&#34; or &#34;Brand New Eyes.&#34; I give it four out of five, because it's still largely a classic Paramore album, but just that little difference in feel has me rating it behind &#34;Riot!&#34; and &#34;Brand New Eyes&#34; in my ranking of Paramore albums.
B003LQ3YXU|1.0|The story line was not very good.  Some decent special effects, but not enough to make up for the writing.  The acting was pretty bad too.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I saw part of this movie on a flight that wasn't long enough to view the entire story and was fortunate enough to have it playing on the return flight so I was able to see the rest of it.  I absolutely loved it and as soon as I got home, I tried to find the book and was glad that I could purchase this online.  I also purchased the movie online, so I could see it straight through from beginning to end with no interruptions.  I just watched it again the other night and I know I'll be watching it again, a fourth time, when I watch it with a friend whom I loaned my Kindle book to.
B0011TNVLY|4.0|My family loves the movie, we watch it several times a year, especially the younger ones.  I know it was early mo-cap, but the children's faces are horrible, just dead rubber.  Do like the movie though, would love an update with new motion capture.
B002MG2ATY|3.0|My husband has been trying to find this movie for a while now, he really was wanted me to see it.<br />The movie is interesting, learned a lot of things I never knew about the Kennedy assassination. Herd a lot of theorys that I never had before. But this movie is 3 hours long (I watched it in two parts) and alot of it is fast talking and flashing from one scene to the next. It's really easy to get lost if this movie dosen't have your full attention.<br />If you like conspiracy theories, you will love this movie.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I enjoyed the book, but just didn't &#34;love&#34; it. It was a good read, but not one I'd recommend to a friend or anything because I liked it so much. Main character was lacking depth.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Set aside a few hours from your day, because you will not be putting this down until it's done. Both awesome and addicting! Very well done!
B00536OCZA|5.0|The re-issue of Dark Side of the Moon on 180g vinyl was something I always had my eye on, as the older record in my posession clicked and popped like a doberman walking on bubble wrap.<br />  This record sounds amazing! The big bass notes are like falling into an abyss and every mind-blowing aspect is clear as a bell (or a bunch of alarm clocks ;-). A must have for anyone who didn't buy their turntable at a garage sale.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book. I was not sure at first, most of the reviews said it was another fifty shades...but I think it is different enough. Yes there are some similarities, but I couldn't put the book down!! It's a great read!!!! Can't wait for book 3 !!!
B009AZZEU2|4.0|As a drummer and music enthusiast, Soundgarden really got me with 'Down on the Upside' back in '96. What a great record that was and still is.<br />  King Animal is a close second, only losing points for a few forgettable songs toward the end of the record. The rest is such a tight conflagration of grooves and riffs your jaw will be sore from hitting the floor. Only a band with the longevity and talent they posess could have made this music and it really shows in this latest, long awaited release.<br />  Soundgarden clearly does not rely on gimmicks such as sleeves of skull tattoos, visually repulsive t-shirts or any other such cliche'd rock-house dreck to prove they deserve to be heard and appreciated in 2013. Hopefully they can stay together this time and show us that quality, worthwhile music simply requires the talent needed to write and perform it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I use the alarm clock every day as I don't have a any other alarm clock.  This one allows you to set multiple alarms each with a different sound or song.  It does everything you need an alarm clock to do and more!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Truly compelling read.  I could not put this book down until I had completed it.  I do no usually read fantasy / future / sci fi stories but really enjoyed this book.
B000059MEK|5.0|This album has turned into a wondorous, genius, timeless classic album since its release. It has helped shape and define electronic music as a whole and inspiried many great artists such as Justice, Sebastian, members of SHM, and countless others.  Forever the best
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Enjoyed the second book of the trilogy but not as much as the first book.  Still remains an exciting read where the reader is drawn into the story and virtually feels asif they are taking part in the action.
B00171R00O|5.0|Rudy is a tremendous, exhilarating, and heart-fulfilling film that takes the theme of a dream, and applies the hard-work and determination to see it through.  It doesn't make compromises.  It doesn't accept defeat.  This film lives up to its plot.<br /><br />The film delves into the nature of what it means to dream, and commitment to that dream and to a team connected to that dream.  It provokes questions as to the nature of personal versus team visions, the conflict between the two, the conflict between various different dreams, and the triumph of the one who tries the hardest and wants it the most.  As a lesson for life, this film is worth every two cents.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Not as compelling as the first two books in the series but it needs to be read anyway if you have read one and two.  Does not end as the reader would expect.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Great movie!! Great road trip movie for my 4 year old grandson even though he has watched it 100 times.
B004QZ9P6K|5.0|An amazing country and unique country Israel . A book everyone should read and learn the truth about what makes a society great.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This shows up in the same format that it does on my android phone...can't change what you see from &#34;top stories&#34; to &#34;most recent&#34; so it's in a hodge podge of order that can be irritating.
0486266885|5.0|One of my favorite books I've read in a while. Such beautiful language and symbolism. Check it out!!! Dr. Jekyll, a man who finds himself in a powerful addiction of a potion that triggers a heavy conflict with one's duality of man.
B00AEFY5MK|5.0|I love this movie. The blue ray version was particularly good. I highly recommend it. I hate that they require you to write a review with a set number of words in it. Very annoying!
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|It's alright so far. Controls are a little touchy while driving but I have fat fingers. The story is alright but just started.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|Same as any other mushy predictable nonsense just like it!  So lame and oh so very corny.  This is a must see for young couple who want to argue about their uncomfortable unfortunate future.  Beautiful blond shows a fair about of boobies so not 1 star, that is the only redeeming quality of it.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|It helps me look up stuff I want to and I like that so I like to use it a lot
B00BF11STU|5.0|Literally the best movie I've seen in years.  Interestingly, this film mostly just reaffirmed my personal beliefs that torture is necessary and sometimes required against people who can and will do damage.
B007WFTFG6|1.0|I don't like this game at all well I wouldm't even csll it a game because games are fun and this game is not fun, I will delete it after I am done here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0307887898|5.0|As one who is starting up a company, I found this book to be very helpful and that it shifted my approach to how to launch and what metrics I should prioritize.  I just hired an intern to get my company off and running and made sure to buy her a copy as well.  She also is drinking the cool aide and thinks that this unique approach is the most valuable.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it because I have horses and my horses name is Herbie and on my horse I named my horse Herbie:)
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Ever since they fixed the touch sensitivity, I have enjoyed this game a lot more. The difficulty and time taken to complete tasks racks up quickly, but this is a game meant to be played in your spare time, not continuously. I recommend it to anyone who likes dinosaurs and looking for an alternative to Farmville.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book. Loved the whole book. Would have liked a clue to the next book though. Will read the rest of the series for sure.
B00136RXN2|5.0|Love Pink, got a sample on Sony's Music Unlimited and was hooked.  For this 62 year old this is very reminiscent of I listened to early in my life.
B00B2GK4KW|5.0|I think it is awesome. I made a bunch of dollies for my sister. She loved them. I will use it a lot in making cards.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|only con is it always prompts you to log in to Facebook to sign up. If you dont link it to your facebook you end up having to go through the rules of how to play each time you start a new game.
0425263908|2.0|I started reading this book, got about one-third of the way through and gave up. I can see why the book stirred up so much emotion, though, and why it became a bestseller. Kudos to Sylvia Day for being able to hit the mark with her readers. I, however, am not one of them. I know I'm in the minority and it's probably a genre thing, but I was looking for more depth than a handsome, rich alpha male connecting with a woman, both of whom have stormy pasts that are only reconciled through each other.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game is incredibly fun and entertaining. Even though I'm not a fan of iron man, I still think this is an awesome app. Especially since it's free.
B008MM9630|3.0|I've had this game 24 hours. It's installed on my kindle fire. The first night it shut down on me 4 times. Tonight it's shut down twice already but the night is still young.  I like the concept of the game and I found myself thinking about my farm all day today but tonight when I opened my game up I put two and two together real fast.<br /><br />Like other reviewers said - you end up purchasing (with your own money I might add) gem stones so you can actually accomplish the quests because they are few and far between and at least half of everything in the store requires gems and a lot of them. For example: I'm currently on level 10. I already am tasked with 11+ quests, most of which I will be unable to complete due to a lack of energy, crystals or because I'm not at a high enough level yet to unlock a specific plant. Let's look at the pumpkin quest - plant 15 pumpkin plants (at 100 coins each but do-able since coins are plentiful), plant 15 midnight squash (can't do that till I'm at level 25) and plant 15 pink watermelon, again can't do that till I'm at level 34!). Add in the fact that if you plant at the wrong time, go to sleep and don't wake up in time you'll end up with shriveled plants that need reviving which OF COURSE costs you energy that only gets replenished ONE (yes you read that correctly) thunder bolt every 5 minutes. Or this quest: Purchase magic harp (for 10,000 coins! (coins aren't THAT plentiful), purchase leprechaun statue (for 7 gems - gems are impossible to come by) and plant 8 clover (at 600 coins a pop!) with a return investment of 750 coins. Add in the fact that there are \\"offers\\" always popping up that encourage you to purchase (with your own cold hard cash) to buy a dragon or unicorns, peacocks,etc - forget fairy farm with friends...it's like playing a farm game with a sleazy used car salesman (no offense to used car salesman but you get my drift).  And yet here I am speeding up my chicken's time so I can feed him 7 times before I go to bed, accomplish the goal and not kill my chicken in the middle of the night simply because I have to catch some z's (does reviving work on animals?), planting fast growing plants to try to get 20,000 coins and praying my pumpkins will plump up before I pass out from exhaustion. In a moment of weakness I bought gems to buy energy but no more Fairy Farm - this relationship is about to end. There's plenty of other farms in the sea....er fields.ccomplish the goal and not kill my chicken in the middle of the night simply because I have to catch some z's (does reviving work on animals?), planting fast growing plants to try to get 20,000 coins and praying my pumpkins will plump up before I pass out from exhaustion.

B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I'm sure this app is perfect if you want to play with your FACEBOOK friends, but that's all. I don't have facebook so this app was a big let down for me. :( I deleted it almost 1 minute after downloading. Glad it was free.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Never a dull moment from start to finish. The story was simple, but with the twists and turns it brought on some complexity to the characters. There was just enough information about each person, yet there was still some mysticism that left me wondering.<br />I cannot wait to get started on the next book to see how the Hunger Games will have changed each person's life back in District 12.
B004ZH66XO|2.0|I absolutely love this game, it's great and addictive an  I'm eager to finish it. But I can't there's a glitch on my kindle and another review mentioned it. The glitch in question is the inability to play the first level on the fourth habitat. My kindle freezes there when the 'speedy' info bubble appears an  My kindle says that 'grow has stopped' the background changes to the selection of levels for the previous habitat. Please fix the glitch, I really love this game and look forward to an update lacking this flaw.<br /><br />-Alicia

B0083DJWGO|5.0|Taleb's ideas are brilliantly simple.  Similarly to other great authors such as Daniel Kahneman, he helps us clear our rational process of thinking and making decisions from emotional &#34;noise&#34;.
B003VANOFY|5.0|A really great product. Love that I can adjust the sound with an actual wheel arrangement and not have to take the headphones off and try to find the volume tab. Sounds are great and works just the way it is advertised. Lives up to the specs noted. Microphone works well and that you can move it out of the way makes it so much better.  Very happy with this purchase.
B00BQBNK04|5.0|The music from this movie was amazing!  The only thing I would improve is the transitions from song to song.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|Definitely appeals to the lower end of the sense spectrum as do all Tarantino's movies. The plot will not leave you guessing but the characters, for the most part, are well developed in a short amount of time. DiCaprio's character arrives fully evolved. It's a standard western with lots of flash and raw, basic emotions on display. Christof Waltz sort of makes the movie worth watching so kudos to Quentin for writing that part. I guess there's lots of folks who take their entertainment like a fist in the gut. For 90 minutes I was one as well.
B002FGU49Y|5.0|I ordered these sandals to replace my 7 yr old Teva's that finally wore out. I was headed to Florida and the beach and thanks to Prime got them just as I was leaving for the airport. When I got to Florida, I opened the box, put on the sandals and headed for the beach. I wore them 3 days straight without a bit of discomfort or &#34;breaking in&#34; period. You can't go wrong with these sandals. I am ordering another pair to leave in Florida as I want to make sure I always have a pair handy.
1400069807|4.0|\\"Salt Sugar Fat\\" started out a tad dry, but it quickly picked up -- it's a truly fascinating look at the food giants, the foods they produce, the ways they get us to eat more of them, and the resulting health effects on the American public, as well as industry efforts to respond. The primary focus is, as you can imagine, on salt, sugar and fat, and how they combine to create cheap foods \\"perfectly engineered to compel overconsumption.\\"<br /><br />The stories of product development were unexpectedly interesting, as was the author's research on the fat, sugar and salt content of those foods. (If I had ever been tempted to buy my kids Lunchables in the past, I certainly wouldn't be now!) I also enjoyed the discussions of food science, which I hadn't previously known much about.<br /><br />My only complaint might be that I'd have liked to see a few more solutions discussed. There is some discussion in the epilogue, which can be summarized in the author's sentence, \\"They may have salt, sugar and fat on their side, but we, ultimately, have the power to make choices.\\" Which is true -- and probably the best (possibly only) solution we're likely to find.
140053271X|1.0|The unit that was sent to me does not power on. I searched on the Internet and a lot of other people have the same issue. It seems there is a problem with the batteries on these units.... They are supposed to last for a long time, but mine did not even power on once. It would be nice for the end user to be able to take the battery out and replace it; I am going to have to send mine back, even though I had to wait a while to get this one and was looking forward to use it, play with it, test it. Ok, so I sent this one back and got the money back, but not the cost to send it back to seller. I bought a second one from another seller. This one powered on, but had other serious issue with it. I tried to insert a micro SD card, but the casing for the card reader was misaligned and my card fell in the device itself. As this could have been labeled as my fault, that I did not pay enough attention to the casing, I did not try to send it back. Plus, I had to take my card out from inside the device somehow. I decided to open the device and forget about warranty to be able to get the card out. I tried to align the casing of the card reader, but instead I managed to break it entirely. The small metal plates broke in one spot and I decided to peel it off completely. I was able to finally put the cover back on the whole device, but without damaging some places of the plastic cover. I figured that 2GB of internal memory would be enough and I would be loading books on it through the USB connector, by connecting to a computer. But it turns out it does not have 2GB available internally to put books on. It only has 250 MB, like other reviewers have mentioned. I do not know if I can root the device without a card reader to put a card in. Have not tried to root it yet, but I read on the internet that it is possible. That would be the obvious solution to many of its software limitations. I went ahead and bought a third device because I really want a book reader with an E-Ink screen that has a card reader and that one seems fine, but I did not played with it much.
B00B2G4O2G|3.0|This show offers a fresh plot,but I felt the story was hand cuffed at times by its station. I think this would be great on a channel with less restrictions.
B00BAVCD8A|3.0|Fall Out Boy proclaim their mission. That mission? \\"Save Rock and Roll.\\" This after a long stagnant period where the band had allegedly broken up, lead singer Patrick Stump had his solo album, and Fall Out Boy seemed dead and buried. Not so, as they claim in the first song. \\"I'll fix you like a remix then raise you like a Phoenix,\\" Stump yelps over the usual bombast and distorted pop that enjoys a current vogue.<br /><br />Which is what frustrates me about \\"Save Rock and Roll.\\" FOB's albums were pastiches of rock and pop elements that rang clear as a bell and had seemingly endless energy. Main songwriter Pete Wentz seemed to groove on Michael Jackson and The Rolling Stones in equal measure, especially on their best album, \\"Infinity On High.\\" Despite the album's title, rock and roll is surprisingly absent from the music overall. It's more pop and elements of hip-hop, closer to Stump's solo \\"Soul Punk\\" than a FOB album. They also succumb to the loudness wars; \\"Save Rock and Roll\\" is compressed within an inch of its life. The mix is so bricked up that it's enough to fatigue your ears.<br /><br />There are highlights, like \\"Phoenix,\\" the lead single \\"My Songs Know What You Did In The Dark\\" and the title track, which features a fine appearance by Elton John. FOB also lured Courtney Love to scream a few times on \\"Rat A Tat,\\" Foxes (whoever she is) on \\"Just One Yesterday\\" and rapper Big Sean for the OK \\"The Mighty Fall.\\" Guest appearances are fine to broaden an album's palette, and frankly Elton's appearance makes \\"Save Rock and Roll\\" a better song than it probably would be without him. That doesn't rescue \\"Save Rock and Roll\\" from its homogeneity or the blatant fact that the band has done much better. For all the heroic bravura in its title, \\"Save Rock and Roll\\" is merely average.

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|The great artists of yesterday become real and Paris both young and old lives forever in Woody's imagination. It is hard to imagine Owen Wilson as a young Woody neurotic type, but he is sublime. A perfect blend of innocence and mischief. He is also able to deliver on the witty &#34;Allenesque&#34; male fantasies, in this case played out by 3 very different women. It is the past, the present and the future. It is Paris in the Belle Epoque, the Jazz age and a city that remains a timeless beauty even into the iPhone era. Paris itself is the star, and its senses delight. You will feel like you are at the party with the Fitzgeralds, sipping the wine, eating the food, viewing the art, and having Cole Porter play the piano. It is a delightful parfait for Woody's fans and it will be just as engaging to the non Allen fans.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|SINISTER<br /><br />Supernatural/ghost/demon stories seem to always strike a chord with me for some reason. That whole things are there but you can't see them/things go bump in the night thing just gets me. I have always loved things like \\"Unsolved Mysteries\\" and \\"A Haunting\\" for just that reason. So when these types of movies come out I am always looking forward to seeing them. The best thing about these movies is when they do it right and have the right amount of atmosphere and chills. This kids is one of those movies as I ended up loving it, in fact it actually gave me chills at certain points.<br /><br />Ellison Oswalt [Ethan Hawk] is a true crime writer that had a huge hit and then could never match the same level of success with each project following. But maybe just maybe this new project of his may turn things around. He and his family are moving into a house that at one time was the scene of a horrific multi murder. While there he is going to do his usual thing and investigate the crime and try to get back that fame he once had.<br /><br />As it turns out he is not that welcome in town by its people or its law officials, but that is not the worst of things. Once settled in a little he discovers a box in the attic, the contents are a few films. So naturally he sets them up and watches them, turns out they are home movies of the murder he is investigating. The crazy thing is that there are more home movies of murders from different states and time periods in the box, and they may all be connected, and they may have brought the same evil into his home.<br /><br />This is one of the best horror movie I have seen in a while, especially from here in America. I have really been enjoying foreign horror films more so the past couple of years but this one is very very good. Written by first timer C. Robert Cargill and director Scott Derrickson this movie has everything you could want from a horror flick. The best thing though in my opinion is the atmosphere of this dark movie. I also like that movie builds and doesn't rush anything. A lot of good movies have been ruined by that. Also the super 8 films that he watches are very creepy and seem very real<br /><br />Acting wise I have to say that Ethan Hawk did a great job here, maybe my favorite performance from him. he plays a man who longs for something lost that slowly succumbs to something truly dark and evil. Juliet Rylance who plays his wife is also excellent here as are the children. All around I liked everyone here including all the supporting players, which is rare because there is usually someone who annoys me.<br /><br />This film comes with some cool features including things on true crime writing but it is the audio commentaries that are the key to me. Firstly we have the director's commentary with Derrickson, and this is full of great insight into the making of the film. I would highly recommend viewing this movie with that commentary first as I think it was recorded first. Then of course we have the excellent and just as great writer's commentary with both Derrickson and Cargill. This commentary as all kinds of interesting facts and stuff that only adds to the film. I would highly recommend this film to any horror fan out there.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Fantastic!  whole family loves this game.<br />We got it for the computer and then had to get it for the kindle.  Things I like about the game...<br />1. My kids love it they are 5 and 4 years old. It really gets their imagination going.<br />2. The possibilities are endless,  you can make ANY thing.<br />3. My kids &quot;play &quot; this game even when its not turned on. They pretend they are zombies, creepers, and their favorites endermen.  They even &quot;play &quot; it with legos!<br />Its a wonderful game for anyone who likes to use their imagination and build things.

B006ID6NDQ|4.0|Stories like these need to continue to be shared.  This book is an easy quick read, that you won't want to put down.  My personal fascination with the topic of the German Nazi persecution of the Jews and stories like Ediths has continued throughout my life.  Why didn't more Jews fight back and how could the German people turn such blind eyes to the horrendous destruction of a race?  I hadn't heard of the term U-boat before and Mrs. Beers courage as a U-boat and for writing this story is admired and much appreciated.

B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|These guys know what they're doing, and they do it so well. 'The Nameless One', 'Lola Montez' and the single 'Cape of Our Heroes' are outstanding. Make sure to view 'Cape of Our Heroes' official video - it's a masterpiece. Also, Volbeat show their sense of fun with 'Lonesome Rider'. Their tunes are often anthemic, without becoming trite.<br />Sonically it's a refreshing recording - where every instrument can be heard. The drums thunder all the way through, and there's plenty of melody. Get it.
B005I64U5C|2.0|MINOR SPOILERS.  As a lifelong fan of DC's stable of characters, I was thrilled to see that GL was getting a modern movie treatment.  The Green Lantern concept is PERFECT for today's unlimited CGI visual palette.  But Green Lantern was a depressingly unimaginative interpretation of one of the most inventive concepts in all of comics.  There are dozens of fan-favorite Green Lanterns (Chummuk, Leezle Pon, Mogo, Bzzd, Chaselon...) that could have played a part in a star-spanning tale pitting the Corps against a couple of DC's heavyweight bad guys.  Assuming the biggest guns like Darkseid and the Anti-Monitor were off-limits due to their eventual use in a Justice League movie in the next decade or five, they could have used Starro, the Weaponers, Despero, Kanjar-Ro, Krona (TECHNICALLY in Green Lantern, but...), Ranx, The Spider Guild, Priest, or a lot of other characters.  Instead, we got a generic smoke monster (no, not THAT [[ASIN:B0036EH3X4 Lost: The Complete Sixth and Final Season [Blu-ray]]] one) with a bit of Krona's backstory tacked on.  Even worse, they fused that character with \\"Parallax,\\" one of the least-popular characters in comics history; a character created as a quickie excuse to retcon an unpopular editorial decision.  We also got a \\"Hector Hammond\\" that had almost nothing in common with the genuinely scary DC character, other than his name and a big (but not big enough!) head.  Hell, they gave us Carol Ferris, so where was Star Sapphire?  It was GREAT to see Kilowog and Tomar-Re, but Hal's \\"training\\" consisted of Sinestro and Kilowog giving him a few pointers, rolling their eyes in disgust, and letting him fly away.  We got a few wonderful glimpses of some of the great GLs, but the Corps was on the sidelines for the entire movie.<br /><br />And these poor choices weren't even the worst part of Green Lantern.  No, that would be Ryan Reynolds, who played the same adorable, insecure \\"afraid to commit\\" romantic comedy lead he plays in every other movie (atleast the ones where his mouth isn't sewn shut).  If \\"Green Lantern\\" had been made ten years earlier, we probably would have gotten Hugh Grant, another interchangeable actor forever linked to a series of dated and predictable girly movies.  Even the visuals, which would have been SO easy to get right with modern tech, were bland and cheap-looking.  The Lantern itself looked too sleek, the GL uniforms were distracting and the seams between the characters' necks and their CGI uniforms looked like 1990s photoshop.  Green Lantern is one of the rare properties where 3D could have really enhanced the story, due to the vast army of Green Lanterns rocketing around the universe battling awesome menaces.  But 3D just made the movie look dim; there wasn't a single \\"wow\\" visual moment.<br /><br />The only glimmer of competent storytelling was Sinestro's arc, which was compelling and believable, including the you-knew-it-was-coming-but-it-was-still-cool after-credits scene.  It's really not tough to portray an arrogant, powerful, \\"loyal, but weary of the Guardians' bureaucratic BS\\" hero, but Mark Strong was excellent.  I would much rather see him in another DC film than Reynolds.<br /><br />I enjoyed seeing Amanda Waller as a potential Nick Fury-type who could someday be the glue binding the various pieces of the DC Universe, but I'm not sure DC will ever do that, at least not in the thoughtful, respectful, patient way that Marvel has accomplished it.  DC must stop making weak copies of Marvel setup movies we saw five years ago.  The company has to break out of this rut which seems doomed to end up in an undercooked paint-by-numbers Justice League movie that will be a pale imitation of Avengers.  That Justice League would be a flop and the critics would hastily declare the superhero genre exhausted, when DC has barely tapped its deep well of iconic characters and stories. Am I the only comics reader who is unhappy that Marvel managed to get Darkseid-ripoff Thanos on the screen years before we will see Darkseid himself (if ever)?  DC can succeed if they start utilizing their greatest asset -- their legendary characters, and the strong, complex relationships they have to one another.  We need a GL-Flash movie (with a couple of Rogues, please).  We need a Superman-Batman movie.  Hell, I'd love to see a Hawkman-Atom movie.  THAT'S something Marvel cannot do because they don't have DC's classic character pairs.  THEN they can do a good Justice League movie.<br /><br />With Nolan's Batman series completed, Man of Steel had better be good, or DC might as well throw in the towel and limit itself to making excellent, but limited animated features like Under the Red Hood and The Dark Knight Returns.  But even though DC is FINALLY pitting the Last Son of Krypton against someone other than Lex Luthor and a barrel of green rocks, we're STILL getting another movie retread in Zod.  Is there any chance that Man of Steel will be as much of a leap forward as Zod's first appearance in Superman II?  Doubtful.

It was worth paying for. If I could change anything I would say I would prefer even more animals to treat and more problems to treat also. After they start repeating it does get a little old but it goes on and has more to do than most of the games I have gotten lately. Really enjoyed it. Would recommend.

B001UV4XIS|4.0|Being a purist, I want filmmakers to follow the intentions and the storyline of writers. In this final installment of the Harry Potter movies, I was almost not disappointed - until the final battle between Harry and Voldemort and the resolution of the Death Stick wand. Why the filmmakers had to change an ending that was so superbly written I'll never understand - but they did it well, despite all. The power and beauty and triumph of the finale are all there, and as praiseworthy as any movie I've seen; I just wish it had been the story J.K. Rowling wrote!

B005OCHOZS|5.0|I normally read before bed to help get sleepy.  With this book I couldn't put it down and I stayed up late many nights to finish it.  I found Scott's stories inspiring and intriguing.  I must admit that this book is awesome because of the comic relief offered by Dusty's comments in many of the stories.  I'd be quietly reading, trying not to wake up my wife and then I'd burst out laughing from Dusty's shock humor.  I can just imagine him barefoot in a parking lot in the scorching desert with a down expedition parka on shouting &#34;hot potato!  hot potato!&#34;.<br /><br />I thought the recipes were great.  Although I made the Adzuki bars recently and I had pretty bad gas the rest of the day.  Maybe that was too much information...

B009178OQA|5.0|Jiro runs a Michelin 3 diamond sushi restaurant in Japan with only a few seats.  His reservations run months out and each plate is extremely expensive, but apparently worth it.  This documentary is a must see for dedicated sushi lovers.  It is not only an homage to Jiro, but a look at the apprentice process, the fish markets, the rice market (briefly), and family dynamics in Japan.  Much of the perspective comes from a food critic who has developed a close relationship with Jiro and eaten at his restaurant on numerous occasions.  Warning that the entire film is subtitled.  Worth a watch, though, even if that irritates you!

I really enjoyed all 3 hours of the movie. If you a Tarantino fan you must add this movie to your collection.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|this story is twisted in all manners. The players/plot/extras are all drawn into a complex web of lies and avoidance. excellent read
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Quick read, especially after watching the movie.  Great way to get yourself wanting to read the second book in the series.
B0028N72A8|1.0|Being fascinated by Google's success and ingenuity of it's founders I wanted to read about a real Google history.  This book is a waste of time. Seems like the author is not only a bad writer, he doesn't understand anything about technology and doesn't get into details about any Google product. Doesn't look like the author has done any investigation on any subjects.
B004LROUNG|5.0|A top notch legal thriller. Love Grishams style. Can't wait to read his next one. You won't be disappointed for sure.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|awesome movie unique story line and give it alll recommendations cool cool cooll throughback with a modern twist yeyye yey
B00BG08FKK|5.0|Ever since I saw the movie I've been waiting to find the soundtrack as it's only just come out in NZ but am so glad I found it when I did for the price I did and luckily you sent to NZ so I love listening to songs I've been fond of since I was 5 movie style over stage show! Thanks A Lot!!!!!
B007EDYN36|5.0|Growing up a Huge kiss fan...and being privy to some of the behind scenes... these boys all had issues. But it's refreshing to hear one of them be so candid.....and not water down the sheer existence of what they really were and became. Rock on Catman !
B000002IQW|5.0|The 3 albums from SKID ROW with Sebastian Bach´s vocals are ALL AMAZING!!!! I really like the 3, but this one....Well, i can´t say if it´s their best,(SUBHUMAN RACE RULES too!)but ALL the songs are totally GREAT!!!! From the heavy riffs of the title track, PSYCHO LOVE and MUD KICKER to the ballads like QUICK SAND JESUS and IN A DARKENED ROOM, this is a MASTERPIECE!!!!SKID ROW was really really great in their Bach years!!!!!
B001RJXA7S|5.0|yeah man one of the best movies of our lifetime for sure. I mean this was the orignal vampire movie. hard to beat that
1432794426|5.0|I'm reading this book right now, and I must say if you wanna learn about Micheal Jackson Read it! I'll give you an inside of what MJ's life was about. How he create his music, how much he loved his children, how unfairly treated by the press he was during the 2005 trial and his whole life, and how big of a genius he was.
B008602KQI|5.0|Having read the books, I had reservations about the movie. Yes, a lot had to be cut out but, all in all, they did an excellent job of casting and keeping the &#34;flavor&#34; of the book. Much less gore than I expected also.
B007EECSFA|5.0|The characters were interesting, the settings were well described and the story was superb.  I loved the surprise ending.  Well written
B0083Z614S|5.0|I have never read this classic of a story before. I happened on it by accident and decided why not. My daughter will read this afterwards and let me know her take on it. Wonderful read.
B005ES0XQY|5.0|Bought these for outside backyard shoes and they are just great the thick tread makes me feel an inch taller but works great for here in Arizona where everything Stings, STICKS or bites
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is a multi-layered story and each layer is extremely captivating.  The characters each have their own personality...some you love, some you hate, some you pitty.  There is magic interspersed throughout the story, but more like a background of something lurking in the shadows.  It is realistic in the way that the author makes you relate, love and root for a character, yet doesn't spare the character any pain just because you love him/her.  There is a place in the story called the wall, and there are those who take the 'black' (they are soldiers sworn to protect the realm) and we are given glimpses that there is something beyond that wall that is evil and terrifying and mercyless, yet we never fully know what.  All the while the kingdom within that wall fights among itself a Game of Thrones, where some are so cruel that they would do anything.  There are secrets that the author drives us to read more to find out more.  The descriptions are extraordinary and I would almost compare this book to the world of JRR Tolkien, but perhaps not quite.  The only thing I would warn about is there are explicit scenes of nudity.  Personally I could do without these but I won't take away from my rating of this book simply because the story is beyond amazing and I could overlook these and they add to the story.  Moving on to the next book right away!!!
B001QB5S3G|5.0|The scenary and music are wonderful.  It is an inspiring true story of how Jesuit missionaries sacrificed all to bring the message of Christ and His Church to those in far off lands in the 1700's, and the cultural differences they encountered.
B000B589JI|5.0|The product is excellent and more than I expected , The inclusion of two methods of securing the canister mean the manufacturer went beyond minimum,
B009FZFONO|4.0|Well, I thought I buy this since I wanted to watch it in HD and I couldn't find a descent streaming link online.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I like this game because it.  is fun  for my 3 year old brother I like how you can grow your own plant
B005PK553C|5.0|Couldn't stop looking but definitely scarier than some stupid movies that come out in theaters.  Characters a little over exaggerated but it fits because it make the show weird and scary
B001KL0WJW|5.0|It's a classic, there's really nothing more to say. Just a non stop good film from the Bronx all the way back to Coney Island.
1856697061|2.0|Loved the pattern suggestions.  Bought new silk material to creat this incredible outfit. Anxiuous to begin on the project, that will challenge my sewing expertise.
B000GJ0KOG|5.0|I love uplifting movies about men in drag. this also happens to be based on a true story, all the better. Very funny, very sweet.
1400069742|1.0|FDR deserves all the credit.  He led America during a dangerous time.  Too bad he has passed, his dynamic and critical thinking could be a example for today's political and frightning problems.
0345525558|5.0|I loved this book on many levels.  Learned about relationships, foster care, and of course flowers.  I liked the use of flashbacks to tell the story, while others  in my book club did not. Especially the ones with the audio version.  They said they couldn't tell if was in the past or the present.  On the whole, my book gave it a resounding approval rating.
B007R3AZNK|3.0|Every once in a while an artist releases an album that is a real game changer. It doesn't just exist as an exemplar of the zeitgeist, it defines the new zeitgeist.<br />This however is another Joe Bonamassa album.<br /><br />BUY! If you're a completist, otherwise just stick Dust Bowl on and play in random order and pretend it's a new release.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My kids love this movie!! I really enjoyed the movie as well...my kids know pretty much every word to the songs :)
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|My husband and I love this show, and watch it all the time! Can't wait for the next season in July!
B004H4XDBI|5.0|If I could give this book a higher review I would. We start the story three years after Mia's accident and it is in Adam's POV. This story tore my heart out and ripped it to shreds. Adam is now a famous sing like he always wanted to be, but knows now that the life he wanted was not one he wants anymore. He is alone and heart broken broken because Mia left with no explanation as to why. When he is walking though the streets of New York the day before he leaves, he sees her face on a big banister.He goes and buys a ticket and listens to her play.This is where are story really takes off. We get to see where his life became a true mess and hoe he remember his Mia before the accident. We see how Mia's best friend Kim has made her life important. One of the saddest parts to me was when Adam said how it was funny that they were the only three of their hometown who went out after their dreams and made it. I started to cry because that was what we all want and they are the most miserable of them all. I also cried when Mia said how Kim still goes and listens to you play. This book was so very gut wrenching and I edvise you to not wear any make up.<br />The ending was the last part that made me cry but in a good way. Life, friendship, and family really do live on. Loved LOVED LOVED read this book!!
B007SGM084|4.0|While the story of the relationship between Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele was fascinating, the repetitive descriptions of their sex life became so tiring that I skimmed over them. I read all three books and hope that E L James will continue the story in another book with less emphasis on sex and more on the Grey family.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|The best game I have played ever and is so realistic about the horses in real life<br />I love it so much
B00BESCJII|5.0|I would actually like to buy this one.  Great movie!  My daughters and I have put this down as a favorite!
B0013FSL3E|4.0|I saw Wall-E when it came out with my family.  Although the story is simple, the characters are deep which is something I love about Pixar. I am happy with my purchase, but at the same time a little disappointed.  I bought it like new, but the cover looked a little beaten up. The CD however played great and for the price I got it, I couldn't really ask for more. :)
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I play everyday and love it. It can be frustrating because a lot of times I can not see my friends list to send hearts
0788859544|5.0|I am a very big Disney fan, and have been making a collection of similar movies like Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, etc. The cover and CD came in excellent condition, and I am very happy with my purchase of The Little Mermaid (Two-Disc Platinum Edition). :)
8674360335|5.0|A slim offering of historical fiction about Johannes Vermeer's enigmatic portrait of an unknown young girl, circa 1665.<br />It's a breathtaking, tantalizing love story....tantalizing because Vermeer and the maid, Griet, almost embrace their passion, each stepping over the line without transgression, but not without hurt:<br />Vermeer, the worldly one, the master, tempted to the edge of the precipice...<br />Griet, the child innocent, heedless of her woman's heat, trespassing unaware and ever nearer to the mystery that she barely understands in the beginning....<br />She feels the lush weight of the earring, his fingertip sears her skin, she inclines toward his touch, trembles with a disembodied, virginal start of pain....<br />Quickly stilled, she sits for him.<br />He trembles--a long moment--with the rush of desire, masters it, and steps back to his easel, granting her a little more time in the childhood she is leaving behind, giving her a peace that will become a bereavement, a keening memory....<br />They look at each other, mute, apart yet bound, in flagrante delicto, withering, without joy....<br />Read more on my blog:  Barley Literate by Rick
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite Disney movies, and one I enjoy watching, not only for the story-line and songs, but for the memories I have of it growing up. I am happy to own it in my collection. :)
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|This movie defenitly did deserve that Oscar and much more, this was defenitly a thriller. I was at the edge of my seat. Ben Affleck, did an amazing job, I was able to feel the fear that the characters felt, I got sucked in and it literally felt like I was there with them. This movie is one of the best movies I have ever watched, the movie should have gotten more praise then the \\"amazing  Silver Linings Playbook\\". You just really wanted the characters to get out of this situation, the acting was very believable and amazing, you will enjoy this movie, I almost didn't buy it, and boy am I glad I did, I have watched this movie 5 times and it has never failed to make me feel the fear and other emotions these characters had.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Mulan is one of my favorite Disney movies. The songs and story are very enjoyable. I am happy to own it in my collection. :)
6305537321|5.0|I wanted to see one of these classics that everyone always talks about and when I did, I understood what everyone was talking about. Breakfast at Tiffany's is one of those classic, cute, funny love story finds that you cant stop watching. I had gotten a great copy with a great price.

B003X27L9U|5.0|This book was absolutely brilliant, it was recommended to me by a few people and i would certainly recommend it to everyone. Be patient because the beginning is a bit off putting but excellently written through the eyes of the child
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great kids game they enjoy the characters and the different challenges also that can connect with friends I even get in to it once in a while
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|The story was fine. It told how things were done in that error.I like history and like to see movies about history but it was to just too darn boring to keep you awake. Sorry but I didn't like it.
B0012909NQ|5.0|I thought it was visually stunning and stage performance was great they knew how to still give a great show.
B003B02OOG|5.0|I really enjoyed reading short stories. They were all well done and easily readable in one sitting. Try it you'll like it.
B0015XASFS|5.0|I ENJOYED WATCHING &#34;AWAKE LIVE&#34;  VERY MUCH AND ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I BOUGHT IT WAS TO SEE LUCIA MICARELLI PERFORMING.  I'M GOING TO TRY TO GO SEE A LIVE GROBAN CONCERT IN HOPES THAT SHE WILL STILL BE WITH HIM.
B000FA675C|5.0|Robert Langdon has to be one of my favorite fictional characters of all time.  I really had a hard time putting this book down.  Sophie and Langdon are thrown together after the murder of the Lourve curator, and seem to hit it off from the beginning. They built a strong, intimate friendship which helped them to solve the mystery of the holy grail.  The story had twists and turns, intelligent characters, and heart pounding suspense. I think you will enjoy!
1609611543|5.0|This book tells a very different story than what we have all been told regarding nutrition and diet. Plenty of 'food for thought' especially for a diabetic. Concepts are backed by numerous studies and data.
B0081X8AE6|5.0|Great deal and an amazing cd, one of my new favorites, I highly recommend it. Not only are the songs & singing great, the cd sounds fantastic
0800141601|5.0|Love this movie old school I don't know what else to write about this movie is just a great movie love it love it & if it gets scratch ill order it again over & over :)
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|you will reach a plateau early if youdon't buy. I can't stay in this thing all day, and I can't pay
B001P06GX4|4.0|Pro:<br />*Fun game<br />*Easy to learn<br />*Moves quickly, enough to play many rounds<br />*Great for spatial thinking and awareness<br /><br />Con:<br />*There are many small pieces, and if you lose any one of them, it affects the game's competitive fairness (since every color/player is supposed to have equal number of pieces)
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Worth the price. Good driving controls, good story, and good graphics. I'm having a good time playing this awesome game.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|You have to be connected to wifi to play this Angry Birds. That's a problem when I try to play at work where the signal is encrypted and I have no connection. However it is fun at home and playing against friends is fun! All the excitement you have come to love!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I did not find this book to be an easy read.  It was like reading a medical report...with a few personal notes.
B007N85POS|5.0|It's Angry Birds! What's not to love! Action packed levels, HD graphics and it's Rio! Get it play it, get 3 stars on every level, delete it and order it again!
B009R659L8|3.0|I have read every MHC book. This is not as good as her other mysteries.  Hard to follow the different characters.
030758836X|5.0|Loved this novel!  I kept thinking I knew whodunnit, but was wrong every time all the way to the end!  I've recommended this book to several good friends!
B009CWWFD2|5.0|As usual Jeffret Archer is  what I call good, easy, relaxing reading.  And as usual,  the last page leaves you with the feeling that something should be done to correct the wrong of this world; in this case, with the feeling that \\"free press\\" is gone and probably forever,  where good journalists are dependant on the whims of the men whose only aim in life is to attain power and become richer in the process at the expense of \\"Monsieur tout le monde\\".  Too Close to reality for comfort...
B009NY43NY|2.0|Warning:  Spoilers in this Review<br /><br />The first 8 books of Charlaine Harris'  Southern Vampire Mystery books were humorous, interesting, romantic, and at times sweet stories that kept you up to the wee hours.  And then the True Blood series happened and the succeeding books lost their touch with annoying inconsistencies in world building details as well as being unfaithful to the original character's personality.<br /><br />Overall the \\"Dead Ever After\\" felt like a forced feeding of bringing back all the characters from the past.  Granted that the typical Sookie life has some murder going on, but it did feel like an overload on enemies.  I was glad though, that her friends were strong in showing up for her when she needed it.  My main complaints with the book are:<br /><br />- too many Sookie enemies.  I know even in the story Sookie asks this out loud \\"how many enemies do I have?\\" but that doesn't make up for it.  There wasn't the world building like earlier books and just too much constant mayhem that I often put the book down to give myself a break as it felt like I was reading the same thing over and over.<br />- granted Copley Carmichael was  no saint, but he was a very smart businessman and I don't believe he would waste energy and resources on hurting Sookie for an offense that was clearly not even there<br />- bringing in Quinn and Alcide without more scenes with them felt like a silly cameo appearance<br />- I think Niall would have been smarter and guarded Sookie, knowing that Claude was out again in the human world<br />- I would have been okay with Sookie not ending up with Eric IF she had a more magical ending herself with someone special.  Sam is just too boring.  It would have been cool if someone totally new had been introduced in this supposedly last book of the series and there was love at first sight magical moment or hey bring back the guy she had a one night stand with in that Xmas short story and then have them both go live HEA in Niall's faery world - anybody but Sam<br /><br />I think Harris is a talented writer and it's such a shame that an imaginative and entertaining series has such a downward spiral.  One can only hope that Harris' next book, \\"After Dead\\" really wraps up the series on a better note.  I could see Harris even extending the series further with \\"The Sookie Stackhouse Cookbook\\" with recipes such as \\"Mr Cataliades' Favorite Pancakes\\" or \\"Scrambled Eggs to Satisfy a Werewolf\\"
B00003CXBK|5.0|I remember seeing this on television, and it was the most amazing thing I've ever seen.<br />It was heavily censored! Was awesome to see it in all its originality.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|It's a great MMORPG.  Great graphics as well.  I believe it could sky rocket to better systems like PS3 and XBOX 360.  - TIMMY
B004TI1WME|4.0|A Nice Simple calculator That Does Simple Functioning Needed By Most Users. Great Tape Feature, However It Would Be Great To Have A Share function.

B00380URIO|5.0|An underrated actor , given a good script, shows his talent!  Makes it look easy!<br />Hope this leads to more opportunities!
B00CJ32S74|4.0|Although it has some slower spots that could use a pick up, its a very good mix of older tunes and new beats! Very entertaining
B00571F26Y|4.0|I feel much better after being on the Wheat Belly diet for about 3 weeks, however the weight loss claims have not been realized, I lost a few pounds when I first started, but have lost nothing in the last 2 weeks.<br /><br />I have been very firm and stayed on the diet, using only recipes from the book, and exersizing, but I am not losing any weight.
B000IFQLLY|4.0|Another great CD from Depeche.  This CD is good and has all the important songs that were popular.  Greaty buy.
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|I'm a fan of the Arnold version and I think this is different enough to warrant being considered on its own merits.  First, it's been a long time since I read the Phillip K. Dick story the movies are based on, so I can't comment on which movie is closer to the source material.<br /><br />This movie has a different feel from the Arnold version.  The backdrop of the resistance and terrorist attacks makes it feel more contemporary and less of \\"just\\" a chase story.  The effects and city backdrops are excellent.  The acting is great.  I'm a fan of Colin Farrel and Brian Cranston - both do an excellent job, as does the guy who plays Farrel's friend (can't remember his name).  Having Colin's ex-wife (Kate Beckinsdale, also excellent) chasing him throughout the movie works pretty well.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very different movie from the older Total Recall, though they share some basic elements.  Both are enjoyable for different reasons, but this shouldn't be tossed away as \\"just a remake\\" of the earlier film.  If you're a fan of dystopian sci-fi films you could do much worse than this.
B00756GKBA|4.0|Well, what can I say about an overgrown teenager Madonna? She can still crank out the songs, but she needs to come to terms with her age.  It's the same topic only many years later.
B00BF11STU|5.0|This movie covers a lot of territory.  It tries to put the US presence in the Middle East in a small amount of context.  Much of the dialog and information rattled off by characters in the movie can be hard to follow - unless you're well-versed in Middle East history and contemporary politics (which I'm sort of, sort of not).<br /><br />So there's some complexity here.  It's not an action movie.  It's not an easy movie.  Torture exists in this world.  Is it ever morally justified?  Well, that's a big question you'll have to deal with as you watch.  The movie makes the case that the US stopped using torture at some point, and I find that unlikely.  Just my inherent cynicism probably, but I just think they moved it farther underground.<br /><br />But that's beside the point.  This is a tense, difficult movie which I found very enjoyable.  To me this movie fits in well with Syriana and Black Hawk Down (off the top of my head) as presenting the inherent complexities and difficulties involved when the US is involved with different countries and cultures that are so vastly different than ours.
B00464AVXW|5.0|Excellent movie but really gruesome.... I have seen this twice now... about 10 yrs apart .... great movie and acting and story line but really gruesome..No KIDS!

0307341550|4.0|Since finishing this novel a day ago I've been struggling with how to think about the dark and wicked drama. As the story unfolded and I learned more about the deeply damaged protagonist, Camille Preaker, and her highly dysfunctional family, I was conflicted between wishing I had never started the book and racing ahead to see what would happen next.<br /><br />Camille, a cub reporter working for a 3rd rate newspaper in Chicago, is assigned to return to her home town of Wind Gap, Missouri to write about the mysterious and macabre killing of 2 young girls. Her editor believed that the killings were the work of a serial killer, and none of the big newspapers were covering it yet. Camille hasn't been back home in 8 years, and has a strained relationship with her mother and 13 year old half-sister. The local hog farm, owned by Camille's mother, is the major employer in town, and the nauseating details of working a hog farm permeate the culture and environment.<br /><br />The saga of Camille's psychological problems and the words that plague her body is revealed throughout her visits with old school mates, her developing relationship with the handsome young detective who is on loan from the Kansas City Police Department, and through her interaction with her mother and half-sister Amma. There are very few \\"normal\\" characters in this novel, except perhaps the police chief and detective. All others are flawed in large and small ways, and the novel certainly paints a grim picture of insular life in a small town. The characters suffer from so many diseases it would be hard to name them all - drug addiction, alcoholism, lupus, anorexia, sex addiction, etc. Stephen King called \\"Sharp Objects\\" a \\"relentlessly creepy family saga\\" and an \\"admirably nasty piece of work.\\" From him, this is high praise indeed, but should give you an indication of the depth of depravity you will encounter.<br /><br />I granted 4 stars rather than 5 due to the rushed and cryptic ending. I felt that it all gets wrapped up too quickly for you to take it in and process the concluding details. Nevertheless, I raced through this page-turner in just a few days and couldn't put it down until I knew whodunit !ll gets wrapped up too quickly for you to take it in and process the concluding details. Nevertheless, I raced through this page-turner in just a few days and couldn't put it down until I knew whodunit !
B006OFN0BQ|1.0|This blue ray movie is either very poor in quality or the producer did not watch his movie. It is so dark that you can barely see the actors and at the middle it stop playing. My TV is a 3D Samsung TV and a 3D blue ray Samsung player.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so awesome I give it 5 star's so fun buy it worth 3.99$ (:!!!!!!!!! get just like pc awesome
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Free with amazon prime. Great show on every level. I can't quit watching! It makes amazon prime worth buying just in itself.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I just started this game but it seems quite easy to get the hang of. I'm entertained. Wish I could zoom in closer.
B009A9BEHU|5.0|I was there and its cool to relive it.<br /><br />Excellent choice of songs (although it left some songs that were played in the tour).
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Great quality, great price and enjoyed the movie very much. Would buy again from this distributor and recommend to all!
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|THE WAY LIFE GOES, by Tom Keifer is an AWESOME Album! I received this album about a week before I saw Tom Keifer's band in concert in Dallas, TX at TREES in Deep Ellum. I wasn't sure what to expect since I had only heard one song at that point, \\"Solid Ground\\". But I LOVED this disc the first time I played it on my Bose Cd player!!!! WOW!! I am a big fan of Cinderella and have loved their music since the 1980's. Well, I love most of the songs on this album. \\"Solid Ground\\", \\"Cold day in Hell\\", \\"Ask Me Yesterday\\", \\"Babylon\\", etc. are a few of my favorites. Tom Keifer's new music reminds me of a combination of Long Cold Winter, by Cinderella, Aerosmith, and The Rolling Stones, with a twist of Traditional Style Blues thrown in for good measure! Oh, and by the way, TOM KEIFER is GREAT in concert too! He even plays quite a few Cinderella songs LIVE. Check out this disc!!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is an intensely addictive read you won't be able to put down.  The characters are deep, rich, and multifaceted.  Just when your determined to hate a character, you find a depth and an insight into their depravity that tempers the hate just a bit....  If you like to be surprised, this is your book.  Just as I though I got a feel for where the plot would go, it would have more twists to it then the stairway in Silo 18.  This is a world I look forward to seeing evolve over many years to come.
B00AF46Q5Y|2.0|I have read all of J. Archer's books but I must say this one was most disappointing. A book that leaves the reader hanging in order to purchase the next is no way for a good writer to complete a book. I found the story line jumped time lines inconsistently leaving many unexplained spans of time. Characters were poorly developed. This book was definitely not a page turner for me when I compare it to some of his previous books. I really don't care what will happen next and have no plans to read the last of the trilogy series.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|the good look and interpretation at a civilized acting society is indeed very thought provoking and stirring.  i thank-you kindly.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love this series. I have the whole series to date and recommend it to anyone interested in historical costume drama.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I've loved all the Angry Bird Apps.  Angry Birds Friends has some new ways to pump up the birds and I've enjoyed playing the game so far.  I just got it recently so I haven't gotten very far into it yet but I think it will rank right up there with all the other Angry Bird Apps.
B004X6PRO6|2.0|I had heard a wonderful interview with the author on NPR which provoked me to buy this book. However, I found it oddly written and I just could not get enthused or curious to continue on in reading it. Althought the subject matter may be worthy, the style of wrting seemed to cover over the stroy-line.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Have been watching on my Kindle Fire. Have watched season 1 and 2 and now starting season 3. I'm addicted!
B002Y0TGOU|1.0|Although the movie was OK, especially without commercials,I did not appreciate the fact that the movie was shown on Fox Tues. Evening. I should have waited and next time I will.
B00867GHS8|5.0|It was out in the theater just briefly. I am so glad that I saw it. The 3D treatment, the feeling of being underwater, completely revitalized the film. Magical!!!
B0064MGU98|5.0|Have always loved this show from the beginning.  Watching again even better.  Get to watch details.  Good TV. Good actors. .
B000BH4YJ0|4.0|Luis Miguel has a satin voice and his renditions of songs are wonderful to hear.  This album is great listening and wonderful background music, too.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Finished reading this in 8 hours. to Had to stop several times to do house errands And stuff but when I'm not reading, I was thinking about this book. Gripping and just a very good read.
193700788X|1.0|This book was horrible!  It felt like all the characters were just so tired, maybe from the chaos of the previous books. They could barely function.  No one was really happy and to me it didn't have a happy ending.  What else was this book for other than to tie everything up in a happy ending for everyone?  We knew it would be the last.  We knew the last one didn't even follow the previous timelines.  I was just hoping she would give it one last hurrah.  Sadly she didn't.<br />I really felt like more that half of the book was covering what she thought she wrote in the previous books.  Like,  \\"Sookie loved Tara.  They used to be best friends and blah blah blah...\\".  There wasn't really a new story and :SPOILERS: in my opinion if Sookie couldn't figure out how to solve a murder that she was accused of after all the other 'adventures' of her other books then maybe she was just plain dumb.<br />Don't waste your money.  If you really want to read it, get it at the library.  At least you are helping to employ a librarian, some one who probably loves reading and writing more than Charlaine Harris and doesn't sell out for a dollar.
B0040Z9H5K|4.0|If you're looking for an insightful view into the human soul and humanity, you're about to watch the wrong movie.  If your looking for a really fun action adventure movie with lots of laughs, watch Iron Man 2.  Robert Downey Jr. Is hysterical!
B001JU4S44|3.0|I think I like this least of the series. Plodding in many parts & a boring villain with no backstory.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Very easy to setup on computer and phone.  Works just like VNC should and allows you to access your desktop wherever you are.  A bigger screen will essentially allow you to &#34;take&#34; your home computer anywhere.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Not what I expected.  Much better and a rich story line.  The pieces were well woven, suspenseful, and had a surprise ending.  Can one ask for more?
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game is so much fun!  It keeps you on your toes and is very entertaining!  I got it for free as the free app of the day, but I'd definitely buy it for .99! Totally worth it!
0684803356|5.0|This by far is my favorite book by Hemingway, very informative about Guerrilla warfare and great character building.  This is a definite read, you will keep turning the pages on this one!
B00CDSVZHY|1.0|You could find far better films to watch with minimal effort.  The acting plot and characters all lack appeal.  This movie mocks the human degradation that slavery wrought which given American illiteracy, a responsible film would not do.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|I loved this intire CD from the moment I bought it when it was first released. Charles Kelly is an amazing vocalist... especially on this record... Hillary and Charles  sound  incredible together.. I love this entire record from start to finish--- \\"Hello World\\" is one of my absolute favorites along with 'Ready To Love Again' and 'American  Hunny' and of course 'Need You Now' 'Our Kinda Love' Love This pain is awesome too along with Perfect day...  If your a LadyA fan, please get this album, it's one of their best, compaired to there just released 'Goldin' and 'Own The Night' both those albums are lacking in more ways then one...  in vocal production (idk what happend this go-round with 'Goldin') I thought 'Own The Night' was rushed..... but 'Goldin' seems more rushed then any of the 3 albums... but this album is a must-have for any LadyA fan... it's the best of the 3 for sure! The vocals are incredible along with the entire record... from start to finish, this album is incredible.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Such a great movie may some day read the book when I am retired.  Hard part was seeing him lose his family but I enjoy all movies where the person does not give up!!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|loved the game when it worked having connection issues with kindle. loads to a point then crashes to home screen.
B00COHIFQS|4.0|The movie was somewhat a new plot for a horror movie.  There were moments my wife somewhat was startled.  The movie was filmed in surprising good quality and had a rather surprising ending.  All in all, the movie kept our attention and was good entertainment for the money.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|It's a good movie, but not as good as the first in the series.<br />Actors were great, premise was interesting.<br />It didn't have the same life as the first, neither did the second of the series.<br />But I got it to finish the series.
6305428050|4.0|This was a favorite of my own children. We watched it together and had the best time remembering better days. I couldn't believe how much the main actors hadn't change!
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|But that is what you would expect from Tarantino. Very entertaining!<br />Lot's of blood but we just couldn't turn away.
B003TOMAPC|3.0|I don't know, I like action movies and super hero movies but this was a little slow moving and outlandish for my tastes. It's supposed to be a real take on superheroes but it still incorporates cartoony plots and sceens.
B00CBKLO52|4.0|I'm impressed with the lifelike motion in this app.  My husband is the pilot and flies both RC & &#34;real&#34; planes.  He enjoys this app.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I absolutely love this app!  I am a Massage Therapist and use this app during my Massage's, it is so relaxing and perfect for when I travel.  I use to use CD's all the time and lug a cd player around, Now I just bring my Kindle Fire and use this app.  So perfect!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Really like this game.  Even without a stylus, the screen is very responsive.  The fast running timer is a bit intimidating, but just ups the tempo a bit.
B00BT0ZDF2|3.0|Because of the beautiful special effects and the entertaining weirdness of the characters, I actually enjoyed this lengthy and unusual saga.  This despite a major lack of coherence and the fact that I wasn't really sure what I was watching at times.  In essence, this film is  an abstract metaphysical treatise centering around some sort of universal \\"Kumbayah\\" scenario.  As such, it seems to be more science fiction than anything else. Therefore, don't look for a thriller in the traditional sense, but rather an unusual combination of action, violence  and philosophical reflection.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I got the app, downloaded it, and it never got into my device. I've never been able to play it!  I got gipped.
B009X01ELC|5.0|This is just what I wanted for my Kindle Fire HD 8.9. It allows me to rotate my Kindle into two portrait and one landscape position. The sleep/wake function is also very helpful.  My only complaint is that the cover is so plain. They need to make more designs or even have it look like a book cover. I would recommend this.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app does exactly what it says on the tin! Good information regarding the performance of your device also.<br /><br />Would recommend this app.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I got this because I was interested in the title. I was 9 years old on that date and I still remember clearly the events of the day! I wanted to see what Mr. King could do with it. He certainly exceeded my expectation. I would definitely recommend this book!
B00CATSONE|5.0|Didn't take long to read, but had some amazing facts about tesla and how the world could have been greatly different had greed not taken over. It is well sculpted and details arguably one of the most innovative humans to ever walk the planet.
B00BF11STU|5.0|The movie is so well done and directed, that I think it deserved the Oscar. I also watched Argo and I liked it too. Being both movies similar in the sense that they want to recreate real history, Zer Dark THirty is much better. There is a lot of detail in each secene, that let's you really understand what was happening.
B00AKFG15S|4.0|Enjoyed as much as previous 2.  Will give you 5 stars if you write another in this series.<br />Pen to papers Sir Archer!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to use and its exactly what it Says it is just a great basic calculator no complaints and would definitely reccomend to anyone
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I use cordless swivel sweeper every day and I can't stand it when  don.t have one.  I told several people about it and several has purchased them.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|This game started out great. I was hopelessly addicted and invested hours into it. Then I got to level 9 and things went wrong. The app stopped working. I troubleshot for a long while and discovered my only option was to uninstall the app and reinstall it. I lost all my work...all of it. I decided this was a good time to end my dino addiction. I uninstalled it permanently. This game is just way too buggy. Also, as some have mentioned,while it is free, it takes FOREVER to play if you aren't willing to spend real money. Just before I lost access to the app, I was at a place where I was having to contemplate spending real money to continue. If I'm going to spend $,then I'd rather have this as a full PS3 game or something. This game could be great, but I don't like losing all my achievements and I don't like having to start over from scratch because it stopped working. I should mention that my access was through my kindle. I don't do Facebook. I have heard that some people can recover some of their game progress by using the Facebook option. Anyway...I lost my park, my dinosaurs, and most of last week.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it helps me alot in class at work really a grate app for work or even school dont waste anytime get yours today
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really really liked this book.  Good story, believable characters and I really liked the main character.  One of my favorites books this year.  I am recommending this to all my friends
B00821OX98|5.0|Great show. Excellent streaming quality on roku. I recommend anyone who lives Steven Spielberg watches this show. Yeah! Watch it.
B000FC11A6|4.0|following the story was a complex exercise as it moved from person to person and time period to time period, but the result was a wonderful trip among the many components.
B009ME47H2|5.0|I Love the Easy Voice Recorder.  It helps me make recordings without having another piece of equipment to carry around.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|I found that the ending to this series was great.Now their was a few things I wished were different but I'm not the author. The way it ended was good but I wished the book would have been a little longer to give more closure. I have been reading this series since the beginning and would have loved to have had a chapter to tie up lose strings. Hopefully their will be a book or two to do this.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|This type of program makes learning history fun. Names become real people with likes and dislikes, ambition and ideas, successes and failures. The acting is much better than what is seen on the average tv show. I am amazed at the locations and old castle scenes. Either a lot of old homes/castles are still in existence or they were very creative in recreating them.
B004QX07G4|5.0|THIS IS THE FUNNIEST BOOK THAT I HAVE EVER READ! Ellen Degeneres is inspiring and humorous throught out the entire book while at the same time she talks about her life and her experiences and how she came to be... Ellen.<br />I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I like how u can get all the armours and see them.  even though it doesn't follow the storyline,  it is a really awesome game!! (my favorite is starbooster.)
B008OOYALE|2.0|I play this on my Kindle & even with that the graphics are small & any words or instructions are difficult to read.  Also there is no ability to earn gold other than purchasing through Amazon.  The amount of food & coins is earned very slow to make the game fun
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think minecraft pe is awesome but I would love of y'all can add redstone to the game I find a bunch of it and its usefull I get its in alpha but it would be awesome if y'all can add redstone. :)
B006LRUVUA|5.0|I was researching to find a way to use Microsoft word on my tablet when I stumbled across this app. I am so glad I did! Now I can access my home computer from anywhere using my tablet! Not only can I type word documents but I can access anything that I could from home. I feel like I've found a way to make even the cheapest tablet into a top of the line computer based tablet like the Microsoft Surface. The app is not laggy at all except for video playback. I wouldn't recommend it for watching those movies you've got stored on your home computer. I love this app!!
B004TI1WME|5.0|This was actually the first paid app I ever bought of the Google Play Store about 3 years ago and it has been a &quot;must install&quot; app on every phone I have had since then. I use it constantly.  I love the &quot;tape&quot; feature.  It has never glitches on me and it does not require updates every other day to &quot;fix&quot; issues.  There aren't any unnecessary permissions or IAP.  I have never been bugged to buy other apps from this company. Well worth the cost and even better as FAOTD.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|Why a game I'm paying for need to read my phone calls and contacts? if you buy this game requires permission to access to almost all your info
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This is the most fun game in the world I like making weird hairstyles it really lets you get creative you should buy it. totally worth the money.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|I used this CPU in my very first gaming build and I don't plan on overclocking, so everyone from /r/buildapc suggested I use this processor. Let me just say that I'm blown away by it's speedy performance. I've been able to run every game I've thrown at it with ease, all on ultra settings (Skyrim, Guild Wars 2, ect.) What a great purchase! I highly recommend this to anyone.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My grandkids love Nemo and all of his lovable characters.  Thanks for making a game to keep them entertained and with characters they love.
B00CL68NOG|1.0|Wow this movie was really terrible on so many different levels, it is just to hard to put the disappointment into words.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|If you love to read Near Death stories, this one is interesting because the author is a brain surgeon and he did not believe the ND experiences his patients told him about until he himself experienced a ND.  Afterwards he uses his knowledge to support his story.  I was impressed.
B008XG1X18|4.0|you can spend a lot of time on this site.  They have plenty of ideas in all areas of interest.  Problem is I spend a lot of time on this site, pinning and liking...  my house work has to wait
B00499QUK2|5.0|It's really well done - in fact, I can't quite put my finger on why I'm giving it a half star less except that I like the USA movie versions slightly better. So, I suppose that's how I'm comparing it.<br />Funny, but sometimes the quips are fast/quiet, so pay attention.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|this is a great place to keep updated on your friends and family.  Especially love the pics, some of the comments are unfavorable but you just need to be careful who you accept as friends/
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I didn't want to read this book bc my sister in law recommended it and she rubs me the wrong way. Loved it in spite of myself. Great plot, strong characters, and entertaining. Could have skipped a bit of the ending, not up my ally, but didn't take too much away from an, otherwise fantastic book.
B00BESFWBY|5.0|Surprising find - I really enjoyed the movie and seemed safe material and language for the kids. Unless you happen to live in an area where there are rocky beaches and 30 foot waves - I'd highly recommend it. The acting was well done, and the storyline overall flowed nicely. There were a few 'why did they do that?' moments  - where the story seemed to jump or not describe how we got from point A to Point B - but it appeared to be due to editing scenes out, or trimming them down. It made me want to jump out on a surfboard in the ocean - and I actually liked Gerard Butler much more in this role than others I've seen him in.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|if you are a fan of hendrix you should listen to this album good stuff there some suff i havent heard i was happy
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect after reading the prequel to this book, but Emily Giffin is a great story teller, and I loved the way she showed change in the characters and had a great ending.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|It was well done and a different story line than the typical love story.  I love Julianne in this role.
0061251321|5.0|Anyone that is in management/leadership and supervises people must read this book. Its pragmatic approach in viewing the employee groups as \\"tribes\\" is really a simple concept that provides a different way of  understanding your employees. This follows with strategies to pull the \\"tribes\\" together and energize toward goal achievement. It has been fun to try the techniques and anyone that is interested in any kind of team motivation, transformational leadersip, etc, should buy this book and read it from cover to cover! I've been in upper level managment/leadership for almost 20 years and this is probably one of the best (if not the best) leadership books I have ever read.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|OK, so I got this camera for one reason; the time delay camera.  For me it was the only reason to get this app, since the Kindle Fire 7 HD camera doesn't have a back camera. I got this app thinking I had solved the front camera problem, to my surprise, it just made a new problem.  Can I now take pics with out worrying if I have everything in frame?... yes.  So what's the problem?.....  the cam for the delay camera is way to DARK.  There isn't anyway to adjust the lightning when  you use the delay camera.  When you access the the regular camera, you have lighting settings, but for some reason, you don't have lighting settings for the delay camera.  So this app gets a 1 until this is fixed.
B000FC1HQY|3.0|I found parts of this book hard to read, but very insiteful to what is going on in some parts of Africa.  I found myself feeling very sorry for this child, but what a life to be born into.<br /><br />Footloose
B00CBRAD2A|4.0|This was a cool movie. Comedy mixed with full out arnold action parts. Lionsgate always delivers. All acting was awesome and i would reccomend to all Arnold fans.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm not one who reads much, but this book has completely changed that. I couldn't put it down. I finished the book in just two days, and just purchased &#34;Catching Fire&#34;.  I can't wait for the next adventure to begin! Let the odds forever be in your favor.
B00BHNR1KQ|4.0|This was scary and without a bunch of gore. Good acting all around. Good one to watch in the dark.
1401937519|5.0|The most amazing book I have ever read.  Thanks to Anita Moorjani for sharing.  It's been life changing for me.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|My favorite Steisand movie is, Whats up doc? I was worried this would let me down. It didnt. What a good flick. Rogen and Steisand are a good combo. I reccomend it to fans of both of them.
B004BLDD9Y|2.0|The amount of light provided is significant. It supposed to be 2700 Kelvin. The problem is I think it's a higher rating than 2700. I have other bulbs that are 2700 Kelvin and they are much warmer looking. You get a lot of light, but it's on the blue side whichI dislike that intensely.
B005LJITS0|5.0|I thought this movie was really good. It was better than I thought it would be. I really loved it!
B009NY43NY|1.0|I was so disappointed in the 13th and final book in the Sookie Stackhouse series.  It feels like she just gave up on writing it and she didn't care what happened to the series fans.  I would have rather waited for her to regain her motivation on the series and postponed the book by a few years, rather than the end result we all received.  I'm just so sad to see it end in such a &#34;ho hum&#34; way.....
B0053TMP24|5.0|This third book of the Heroes of Olympus series explains everything perfectly, and keeps the mood of the story intact. I should know, because I have read the Percy Jackson series, and the Kane Chronicles. Another job well done, Rick! Keep going!
1616615362|5.0|I am simply amazed by these game pieces. If your just buying these as a fan or to play the game the detail is better than most SW ships/ vehicle items out there. I would compare the detail to that of the Hallmark orniments and so far what looks to be to scale compaired to the other ships in the series. An X-wing compaired to Slave one or the Millennium Falcon looks scale accurate to how they would look in the movie side by side.
082300659X|5.0|Not only the book has a great cover and pepper, the information in jt is really useful, it comes with a DVD wich helps a lot to understand the main concept of the book, i recomend it.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|I can figure that I have to have certain ones in a row but I have not been able to figure out past that.
B000HZHBIM|5.0|I loved watching it and I would recomend it to any trekkie fan in the world or the universe! Thankyou.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|Phillip Phillips is NOT a Dave Matthews clone.  If you think this, then you don't know spit about DMB.  Listen to their music!  There are no similarities other than an occasional stretch of the imagination to say that Phillips sounds kinda like Matthews when he is singing.  Phillip Phillips is a modern folk musician sitting on the edge of indie styles.  DMB is a group, and Dave Matthews a person, who both defy conventional categorization other than that they span and breach the spectrum between fusion jazz, folk rock, and that ambiguous title \\"world music\\".  Phillip Phillips is very definable and very original.  The smatterings of innuendo which are not very flattering, that he is a DMB clone, or a Mumford & Son's rip-off artist, these effluvial stains need to be eradicated once and for all.  Phillips was the first American Idol contestant to stand his ground and to not compromise himself to the producers of a show which is finally showing signs of degenerative joint disease.  Thankfully, Phillips held hard to his line and his debut solo album effort is at the very least, the most innovative and intellectual property to ever be birthed from a show with pubescent teens as its target audience.  That's the good news for prospective purchasers who have only been able to listen to sound bites at Amazon or All Music trying to get a \\"feel\\" for the album beyond a couple singles.<br /><br />I will say that this is not a monumental release, worthy of volumes of dedication from critics and artists, but it is a valiant effort worthy of listeners pining for something beyond the technocratic scatological output which an inane industry deems fit to foist upon the public as being the current high-art of music.  If your bag is the trend of electronic-dance-hip-flop music with artist who insist on singing runs from first note to last in a spectacle of vocal acrobatics that couldn't possibly match a REAL singer, and celebrities who insist on being headlines for the paparazzi and National Inquirer, if you don't want cerebral stimulation and just want primal instinct and low impact on a pre-frontal lobotomy, look for another CD to buy.<br /><br />Phillip Phillips has written some intelligent, catchy, and unique songs here, along with a few tunes crafted for him.  Not all of them are great, but all of them are good, and more than a handful are really worthwhile for purchasing the whole CD.  It is difficult to find \\"new\\" and \\"creative\\" in the last couple decades, especially for boomers and for intelligent young audiophiles.  So, I will make it easy on you, as much as I hate to compare artists (and sure they hate it too).  If you like Gin Wigmore and KT Tunstall, and yes (grumble) Dave Matthews, and Jason Mraz, and if you are hip to some of the folk greats like Dylan and Gordon Lightfoot, and if you like modern/recent folk-rock contemporaries like M&S and They Might Be Giants, then you have nothing to fear and will in all likelihood enjoy this album a lot.<br /><br />Gone Gone Gone and Home do, in fact evoke some chemical reaction which an M&S fan is going to either enjoy or disdain, I happen to be in the former camp.  And if his crampy vocals elicit a few tinges of DMB antidote for withdrawal (liken it to morphine for heroin addicts) then so be it.  But too many professional and armchair critics have been mad about it, to the point of foaming at the mouth and yet the overall critic reaction has been generally favorable.  What this album does do is rise above the trite neo-pop movement and demonstrates an elitist potential in Phillips as a musician and songwriter as well as a unique vocalist.  Man On The Moon, which opens the album heralds exactly what you are going to be getting here, well-crafted tunes with solid hooks and skillful lyrics.  If I have one complaint, it is that Phillips invokes \\"hold on\\" just a little too often in more than two songs, almost like a personal catch phrase.  The acoustic guitar phrasing, the sometimes brooding, but equally as often optimistic inflections of voice, the very subtle jazz leanings, all are a compelling reason to enjoy the album.  Again, Man On The Moon is the best of the solo-penned tracks (in fact it is my favorite song on the album), the other three are lesser efforts, but the collaborations are where the real magic happens.  Realistically, you might get bored in the middle and a couple songs end up as so much more of what came before, but:  This is not your typical \\"Idol\\" album, far from it, it is an ace first effort, a solid debut and if nothing else, a glimpse at an artist who might grow up to be \\"somebody\\" in the music industry.  I find it funny how the best new artists are all \\"hidden\\" gems with cult followings, and the mainstream sensations who garner \\"hits\\" via download count; it all reminds me of the 60's and some of the 70's.  As soon as your favorite secret group hit it big, suddenly their song craft became distilled and sometimes the after-effects left you wishing they had remained a cult-based mystery.  Phillip Phillips has, because of a television show, been able to hit the charts with immediate success and yet (for the time being) held the Idol producers at arm's length in crafting his debut album.  What follows is to be seen, but I have a hunch his releases will get better over time and quite possibly his following will trickle to a base core of enthusiastic fans.  That might be good news.<br /><br />Between 3 and 4 Stars, I am opting for the better side of the two.lly as often optimistic inflections of voice, the very subtle jazz leanings, all are a compelling reason to enjoy the album.

B000HZD168|5.0|The Wrath of Khan was amazingly frightening and awesome for an older movie, please watch it if you like Star Trek.
B007TK77QE|3.0|started reading this and gave up a couple of chapters in. Will probably go back and finish at some stage
B008220DGE|2.0|Very loosely based upon L. Ron Hubbard and the beginning of Scientology, THE MASTER revolves around the character of Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix). Although he is a Navy veteran who served in WWII, Freddie never really saw any actual combat. He's a troubled individual who just doesn't fit in no matter where he goes in the world. However, after sneakily stumbling aboard a yacht owned by the seemingly wealthy and mysterious Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Freddie finds an individual who seems to understand him. Dodd brings Freddie under his wing and uses him to help further his agenda in spreading the scientific religion Dodd started, The Cause. The Cause offers Freddie a purpose he has never had before, but it also threatens to stifle his wild and roustabout ways and destroy his very existence.<br /><br />At face value, THE MASTER has a lot going for it. Like most all of Paul Thomas Anderson films, the acting is top-notch. It's a thrill watching Hoffman and Phoenix go against each other on the screen. The scenes where they are together are thrilling. However, these two individuals are just the most prominent in a cast of notable actors and actresses and every single one of them delivers fine performances.<br /><br />Beyond acting, THE MASTER also offers some very impressive cinematography. Paul Thomas Anderson fills his films with cinematic visual treats and THE MASTER is no exception. In some ways watching THE MASTER is like watching a Terrence Malick movie, but a Terrence Malick movie with an actual story and plot.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though THE MASTER does have a story and a plot, it's a pretty paper-thin one. Also, despite the fine acting performances and the incredible beautiful images, THE MASTER really isn't a very good movie. I love movies and often enjoy watching films that other people consider boring. I'm not sure what it means, but there were several times during THE MASTER that I found myself bored and looking at my watch. In fact, I found the movie so boring, that I stopped the DVD about halfway through and finished watching the film a few days later. I thought that if I gave it some time and space to gel, I might enjoy it better. I was mistaken. The second half of the movie was almost as boring as the first.<br /><br />So, although THE MASTER has some great acting and impressive visuals, it fails to master the basics of storytelling. Not recommended for the casual movie watcher.nd the movie so boring, that I stopped the DVD about halfway through and finished watching the film a few days later.

B001N9ESQ4|4.0|Before Sunrise/Sunset/Midnight is a great idea.  I've immensely enjoyed seeing the relationship develop.  It's not always real; sometimes it's more than real - believable and unbelievable, too good/bad to be true.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is just as the title says, awesome! you can build your own world and can play with friends as well on the same wireless network. The only sad part is I bought the game when it was worth $7.00, but hey, it's an amazing game.
B001NA6096|3.0|Before Sunrise is the beginning of My Dinner with Andre on wheels, about relationships, over time in real time.  See all three, don't stop at one.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|So far I like it, they've done a good job of making me interested in the characters and the plot line.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game had both challenging HO games and puzzles. The story line was amusingly well thought out. This company is quickly becoming the &quot;go to&quot; company in this genre.
193700788X|1.0|Thank you for the SPOILERS and the honest review of this book.  Now, I don't have to waste my money and buy this book.  I have been devoted to this series and fell in love with it, waiting every year, for the next book to come out.  After reading the last three in the series I prepared myself not anticipate this book.  Thank you, once again for saving me money.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|Too much dramatic music and lengthy battle scenes. Need to re-read the book again as it's been a few decades since I did, but the movie seemed more sensationalized that true to Tolkien.
B00BU18U82|3.0|Ok game,, definitely a way to take up  time.  Found it really hard to drive the tractor and the guide isn't very helpful great quality though and good ideas behint game
B00CHI5F5S|5.0|My husband & I loved it, had it's comedy flavor and more importantly the bad guy got a big PAY BACK twice, a real beat down at the end and again in prision.  Who's the tough guy now.......
B007SGM084|4.0|The sex scenes were a bit much, but I found the psychological story of Christian most interesting.  Enjoyed very much.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Not the best of his books. The characters in this book had a pretty boring story to be told. Par at best
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Great finale to an epic spanning years! Brandon Sanderson did great justice to the work of Robert Jordan! Thank you for supplying brain food for so many years!
B00COHIFQS|1.0|Do not waste your time with this movie!!  It could not decide on whether it wanted to bore you to death or scare you to death, so it settled on somewhere in the middle!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My husband and I downloaded the game at the same time and we are enjoying trying to outdo one another in designing reefs, getting sand dollars, vitality, etc. Very educational as well!!

B0090SI3ZW|2.0|Rapper and wannabe actor RZA also directs and contributed to the screenplay (with Eli Roth) in this Tarantino endorsed throwback to `70's kung fooey movies.  RZA plays an under-the-radar metal smith in a Chinese province circa 1870.  He had escaped slavery with the help of his mother (Pam Grier) and hopped on a boat for China.  It sunk with everyone on board drowned but for Blacksmith as he is known.<br /><br />His main job is to fabricate the unusual armament for the local thugs.  In a thin plot, a shipment of gold is being transported to the governor over land, protected by a top notch group of guardians.  Also interested in the gold is a mysterious caucasian named Jack Knife (a portly Russell Crowe) and the owner of the high end brothel, Madam Blossom (Lucy Liu).  Rick Yune plays one of the good guys known as The X-Blade because of his ability to fling various sharp instruments at his adversaries.  He's headed to the village as well to avenge his father's death at the hand of the aforementioned thugs.<br /><br />Numerous battles take place always involving magical feats of jumping and suspension in midair.  Some of the weapons are admittedly pretty cool, but much of the action sequences are nothing special in this day and age of photo trickery.  Perhaps the most memorable sequences are the massive amounts of blood spurting during the fight scenes.<br /><br />So here is an \\"R\\" rated, violent film that takes place largely in a whore house.  There are plenty of comely employees, who bathe together and have vigorous sex with their clients...all fully clothed!  RZA needs to take in a few episodes of TV's \\"Gladiator\\" or \\"Game of Thrones\\" to see how to mix decapitations with nudity and not miss a beat.

6304806418|5.0|I have watched Evita on TV in the past; now I have it and I loved it.  Mixed with speaking but mostly singing, it is the best musical drama I have ever seen.  Madonna did a spectaclar job as the main character and Antonio Bandaras?  What can I say--he was superb.
B0002RQ2T4|5.0|This is an amazing sci-fi on many levels. First the story is generally enjoyable. There is an appropriate mix of conspiracy theory, futuristic tech., and Japanese pop-culture. If you enjoy the video game Deus Ex, then you'd probably enjoy this movie. This movie will become a classic. Second, this movie brings up many interesting questions such as - what makes us human? There are more intriguing questions, but I cannot list them without leaking potential spoilers.<br /><br />I would say this movie is a bit similar to Akira, but Akira plays up Japanese culture and views a lot more than this film.<br /><br />The disc came in good shape.

B009NY43NY|2.0|I have been a fan of the Southern Vampire Mysteries for many years. Though Books 11 and 12 weren't nearly as good as previous books, I was looking forward to a fitting conclusion to this series. Boy was I disappointed.<br /><br />I will try not to re-hash everything that has already been said. This book was just plain poorly written from start to finish. Charlaine Harris didn't seem to care about continuity, believable dialogue, pacing or giving her characters their due. It reads like she was completely sick of the series and just phoned it in.<br /><br />I believe she stretched this series several books longer than she was interested in writing because of the success of True Blood. If she didn't have the pride and integrity to say no thanks to continuing a series she had no more passion for, then an editor should have had the balls to tell her how bad this book was and work with her to fix it. Such a sad and disappointing end to what was once a really entertaining series.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|My wife and really enjoyed this movie. We definitely would advise others to check it out. You will get your money's worth.
B00821OX98|5.0|With each new chapter I had things to look forward to. It was like the old serials i grew up with. Was very well written and executed. It had a lot of ups and downs and that really added to the program.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I find that having my books on my phone (Droid Razr Maxx, so big screen and no battery problem) is more convenient than carrying around a 2nd device.  This app is great - not only for Amazon books but also checking out library ebooks in Kindle format. I haven't read this much since high school!  It's a Must to install.  Also, I haven't had any problems with it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A psychological thriller that speaks to current preoccupations with status, class and the veneer of success we project to the world compared to the turbulent, complex emotions within. In this book the main characters are in varying degrees of denial about their lives and feelings, a problematic state of mind that is endemic in 21st century American society.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a AWESOME game I recommend this to any other ppl trying to get a fun app it will keep you entertained and will have you wanting to Win!!! But yea overall a good game
B0091TGWYE|4.0|The product is as advertised.  It looks nice, feels nice and works well.  I took a star off because I wanted to use it to carry business cards and the fit is, well, too snug.  Only a half dozen or so cards fit in the slot; but, it is still a nice product and I like it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun, addictive, and great for the younger kiss. They may no fully understand but they will love it lots!
B000RFPORM|5.0|I have seen this film ten or twelve times in my life. Each time is more than a rediscovery : each time is a new experience and an enchantment.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Again I read this book because I hadn't read it in my younger years. I loved the characters and the humor of the book. I would like my grandkids to read it because it is a classic and a great book! I also like that the classics are free in Kindle.

B008ASGP3U|4.0|The story moves along with good character development. Keeps you in suspense as the mystery unravels and the chase is on. Fun read and would be a great travel book.
0470876417|3.0|Has some useful info, but nothing earth shattering. I was a little disappointed.<br />Searching for something more enlightening.I would not recommend this book.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I read some reviews of this album that made me hesitant to buy it. Glad I did because I think it is one of the best albums Rod Stewart has made. His songs about divorce, advice to children, happiness share with the listener his life  journey.
B00BK40QO0|5.0|These readings are already well known, especially 2, 9th symphonies and Songs from the Earth. 7th has not been my favorite so I passed it over. Remastered sound is truely amazing, with a lot of orchestral details now emerged afresh! For its asking price it is irresistible.
0756666937|5.0|I just happened to get pulled in on a &#34;Lego build&#34; a few weeks ago (I'm an adult and hadn't touched a Lego in years) but I had fun and started poking around Amazon...bought this book for $11 from a Marketplace seller to indulge my short-term interest rather than plunk down a small fortune for a Lego set.  I love the book - gives a nice detailed history of Lego as a company and profiles many Lego sets, from the basics to the co-branded stuff.  Easy to pickup and just flip through the great photos of Lego creations, or go deeper and read all the details.  I love having coffee table books around and this was a nice addition to the collection.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|I never get tired reading this story.  It is a timeless tale on the human condition.  A good beach read.
0439943655|5.0|Philip Pullman's HIS DARK MATERIALS trilogy, which began with the outstanding `Northern Lights' (since made into a motion picture: The Golden Compass) is a simply stunning series. What astonishes me most is the author's wonderful creative vision and inspired ideas that make this trilogy so unusually rare, and so refreshingly original that it is incomparable. This book, both powerful and subtle, is utterly remarkable as to dazzle and delight. Philip Pullman's range of ideas, of plot and place, and sensation is so vast and beguiling that it cannot fail to leave you in awe of his work. From the impressive Magisterium to the fantastic Gyptians, to Daemons (human souls) to Witches and Alethiometer's; this is a magical world filled with innumerable wonders. Pullman's writing is hugely ambitious, courageous and dangerous, professing all the qualities of an accomplished author and sublime storyteller. Finally, with the last installment and thrilling finale, you get an explosive energy as electrifying as a firework!<br /><br />\\"We're going to the land of the dead and we're going to come back.\\"<br /><br />Will and Lyra, whose fates are bound together by powers beyond their own worlds, have been violently separated. But they must find each other, for ahead of them lies the greatest war that has ever been - and a journey to a dark place from which no one has ever returned...<br /><br />This exclusive paperback edition contains NEW material previously unavailable before, which is acutely interesting and which adds even more depth to this substantial story. Within the Appendix are letters from the archive within the Magisterium on Mary Malone, and which are strictly confidential! This is a truly astonishing and imaginative feat, in which Philip Pullman has conjured a universe of intensity and beauty that leaves you gasping. When it comes to sheer inventiveness this is a writer without equal, whose books appeal (similarly to JK Rowling's Harry Potter series) to both young and old alike; hence the adult editions. Pullman is such an original and compelling storyteller, with his books literally leaving you breathless. This dazzling, multi-layered masterpiece will harness the imaginations of children and adults, now and in future generations for it is labeled (in my mind) a firm \\"classic\\".<br /><br />If you love fantasy and science-fiction then I couldn't recommend a better book nor a better series.alike; hence the adult editions.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Great and fun game I also hAVe this game for my XBOX 360 I think the XBOX one is better and the.pc one is also better.so get that if u have a chance but if can't it's still a good that u can experience it on tablets or phones.JUST NO ENER MAN NOR ENDER DRAGON ON THIS VERSION

B004SIP86Q|1.0|Two lesbian teenagers are found out by their parents.  The parents then choose to separate them.  One family plans to move away thereby ending their relationship.  The children then, in retaliation, kill one of their mothers.<br /><br />The movie chooses to defend the teenagers' actions.<br /><br />When I say it's bad, I don't mean low quality.  I mean evil.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|I'm not generally an Ashton Kutcher fan but the more I see him in film or TV, the more I like him.  He's not a great actor but he always seems to play likeable parts.  And Natalie Portman has got to be every guys fantasy girl.  She's gorgeous, sexy, uber smart and not a drama queen or diva.  It's not a great, thought provoking film but I was entertained start to finish.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|The look inside of the mind of a teenager, one who feels she has lost all control. It's real and it's happening out there everyday to both teens and adults alike. Deeply moving and hard to forget.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|If I did poorly on a level in &#34;Angry Birds&#34; I did not worry, I just moved on.  Playing in competition with friends from Facebook?  Ohhh... that brings out my competitive edge.  I would not go to bed last night until I beat my son-in-law's score!  It is great fun.
0312430000|3.0|The book is very interesting and engaging, the ideas and stories are good experiences but as the Checklist should be concise, the book could be much more better if it was concise to what mentioned as 'killer points' direct points.<br />Still the book is good and recommended.
0307476073|1.0|This is quite possible the worst book I've ever read and I'm shocked that others would recommend it. I kept reading it thinking this has to get better, surely this will get better or more interesting. It never got more interesting. The book is boring and the author seems like a messed up person.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|There are 28 selections for USA and everyone of them come up, Sorry cannot play..This Video cannot be played. No other information or directions.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very entertaining. It is challenging but not frustrating. Definitely worth the download.  Played on my Kindle Fire. Thank you for the entertainment.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|good game that keeps me interested but I think it is way to hard to get acorns so I don't know how much longer I will play.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|it's an attractive game to play.  and you can earn lots of points if you play the game subway suffers.
B005PK56TA|4.0|Overall thought it was great entertainment, but felt like there weren't enough lighter moments, until the last episode - which did not really wrap up all the subplots well.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|And here's another good &#34;Cruise&#34; movie that's much better than the average movie these days....The show keeps your attention all the way !
B00AB7HESI|1.0|Very upsetting, paid for the app and it won't install on Nexus 4. What's going on? I really wanted to play this game.
B004J4WKTW|1.0|I found it difficult to relate to any of the characters and didn't really care who won the game with no beginning, no rules and no end.  The plot was so flimsy as to be nearly non existent.  The author showed lots of imagination in creating the various tents in the circus but I couldn't figure out what relevance they had to either the book or life.<br />Why was this book it written? It will certainly have no impact on my life.<br />I should reveal that I was the only one of eight people in my book club who did not like it. They were fascinated by the imagination and creativity revealed by the circus and the weird plot line.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Let me start by saying that this game does have some glitches, but is perfectly fine to play. If you like bingo,then you will like this game.  It's fun and you do get competitive trying to achieve getting the virtual rewards. Yes, you can run out of coins to play, but you can either wait to get your daily free ones or buy them.  If you're willing to wait and do run out, you can always talk to the friendly people from all around the world that are having fun playing and chatting to each other. Either way you will enjoy playing the game.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I got this book for my daughter to read and was thrilled when I read it as well, I look forward to the movies that will accompany the book. The writing is detailed, suspensful and keeps your attention.  Great book series.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|This movie came highly recommended and I also concur.  While I also bought the other two movies these guys made, sure wish they had more.  Funny!!! Yes indeed!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I was a bit hesitant about letting my expectations get to high for the concluding book in a fabulous series.  No need to worry, this book easily met or exceeded expectations for a great conclusion.  If you haven't read the previous Wheel of Time books, don't start with this one.  Go back to the beginning and start there.
B000RJO578|5.0|Another classic example of Amazon.com not knowing their left hand from their right hand.  Both Widescreen and regular are on the same disk.  I purchased just ONE disk not two.  Maybe they expected me to watch it both ways and that I am to review the movie twice.  If I wanted to watch any of these movies twice it would have been “PAUL” That is one super great flick.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the trilogy. Sad to see it end. Disturbing but we'll written.  Would recommend it to others, not for children though.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|While I enjoyed Infinity on High, I simply cannot get enough of this album.  The variety, the lyrics, and the actual musical instruments....delightful!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|My girlfriend bought this for her Kindle Fire while she was in the hospital after giving birth to our son and sadly I got to play more of it than she did. I played Bacteria and Virus then let her have the game back and bought it for my own Kindle Fire. A month later i have finally unlocked Necroa and am trying to take over the world with my own Zombie Apocalypse. I cannot wait to see what the final two plagues are. If there is a sequel I would buy it without a second thought. Miniclip did an excellent job on this game and hope to see others.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Great movie with great quality. I would buy a similar product again. If you are a fan of this movie do not look any further.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|I've been a fan of Joe Walsh since the beginning .Its great to hear him on a solo 'album' again. Joe has always commented on society through his music and continues with this album. The song &#34;Analog Man&#34; says it all about our generation trying to deal with new technology. He's back!
6305311463|5.0|I love this movie and now I own it in every available version and format thanks to this one! Obvious external wear but it plays just fine!
B00991TCOG|5.0|I love listening to her music. She keeps me relaxed and focused at work. I can listen to this all day long, over and over.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It is beautiful to look at, simple to play and the music is wonderful. Sometimes I just leave it on so I can hear the music. Very relaxing, soothing, adorable game. Not really for young kids. It requires some patience and some time, but I still really like it. I've already recommended it to a few friends.
0316228532|4.0|I bought it because I grew up with and love Harry Potter dearly. This book was well written, but a little too sexual and grungy for my taste. Would not recommend for readers under 16 or 17. The large cast of characters were a little hard to keep track of at first, so I had to read the first few chapters twice before proceeding. Well written, gripping story with the highly developed characters JKR is so skilled at creating.
0875847706|5.0|This book is an eye-opener, because it suggests a way of looking at life that frees us from our assumptions, many of which are limiting and oppressive. The authors show how they have emphasized, in all situations, how you look at what's possible and desirable, rather than accept what's put in front of you. The section on &#34;Giving yourself an 'A'&#34; should be required reading for anyone who works with people on a regular basis.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series is great, you never know what is going to happen in the next chapter. I highly recommend it!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is a cool game. I like this game. It is a challenge and fun to play. The animals are neat and cute.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|It is the best cut the rope game I've ever played yet and you must feed two omnoms instead of 1
B008EZVNFE|5.0|Stopped what I was doing when I first heard her voice.  A real triple threat, she can play, sing, and write amazing songs. Saw her play live recently, brought a few friends along who fancy themselves music snobs, they trusted me on the pick without hearing her. They were not disappointed, despite how much I talked her up.
B00081U7HC|5.0|This film is a classic. I remember seeing this movie as a girl and it makes you dream of your happy ending. I can't complain. It is a movie that even the guys won't mind watching.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|I thought this movie was well done, It has action and drama but nothing too deep to think about second time I watched it so I must really like the movie.
B0091REZMW|5.0|It definitely is a game worth playing. Testing your skills to see if you can beat the clock, while trying to find the different objects listed. I like the different objectives,along with the different experience levels. The only drawback, it sometimes doesn't load and you lose the gifts. Having to start all over to earn them. Which does seem a little unfair. But it's the perfect game for all ages.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is seriously worth reading! Surely by enjoying book 1 aswell. I am personally very much looking forward to book no 3 &#60;3
B005LJITS0|3.0|Interesting comic book hero with a normal everyday perspective. GL certainly needs another movie to enhance the great possibilities with this powerful comic  book hero.
B00881PTRC|3.0|Has cute animations and helps with spelling I presume. Family fun for all. A new twist to an older game.
1593272200|5.0|I purchased this book to use on my job as a part time programmer working from home on scientific applications in a Linux environment.  I am considered an expert in the domain of interest and have an adequate knowledge of the c language so I'm not new to programming in general. I primarily needed information on POSIX and System V shared memory applications in Linux and this book met my needs perfectly.<br /><br />This barely scratches the surface of what this book has to offer.  So I'm completely satisfied.
B00AQM8H9I|3.0|Its a cute game the kids love when the penguins get ate. I dont think they understand the concept much but then they are young .
B007J4T2G8|1.0|What bothered me was the very poor writing.  What a bore!  I cannot believe the American people would elevate it to the best seller list.  There are some beautifully written, borderline pornagraphic, novels that have found there way to fame and fortune.  .  I'm not an expert on them, but I read a few.  But this....you've got to be kidding.  What a waste of money.  The author must be laughing all the way to the bank.
1416972250|5.0|love this first book of Cassandra Clare very interesting read, sad though how Cassy met her faith. being blind sighted about her destiny
B0050DIWFC|4.0|It was one of those books you couldn't put down.  Aside from the fantastic plot, it offered new insights into DNA research.  Highly recommend it.
1439153663|5.0|Kitchen house was a very interesting read for me, I have read books about slavery but this takes the cake. all the different things that happen,, what you didn't really expect..
B004W2UBYW|5.0|What a great author!  He detailed Steve Jobs' life in such a way that one could barely put the book down.  Great book.  Fascinating life.
1416972242|5.0|On her second book poor Cassy has to face all these changes in her life that her dear mother tried to hide from her
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I cant stop playing this game. As a girl I've never been into video games that much but this game....it's taken a toll on me. Anyone who doesn't download it is missing out
B00BEN0YP8|4.0|I did like this movie.  Because his story takes place during the horrible things that happened to so many people during World War II, you may have to turn your head away (not your heart) a number of times; nonetheless it was a very interesting movie and I was moved by Schindlers' ultimate kindness in the end.  In the beginning his &#34;kindness&#34; wasn't quite the real thing, as it was based on his own selfishness, but as time goes on, his heart is changed and does turn towards genuine love and the desire to help protect and save some of the Jewish people, as much as he was able to do.
0143120255|5.0|If you know Paris and New York, each page of this book will bring a smile or a laugh.  If you don't, it is an inside view of each city's similarities and differences.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I really like this game. It is lots of fun to play. My son likes to see all of the fishes.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed the trilogy. I was told I might not like the ending but I really liked it. Reminded me a bit of Jean Auel novels.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As usual Tom Clancy took a subject that is facing the United States and turned it into a page turning novel
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This was a really fun puzzle game with excellent graphics. The only problem I had with it was how short it was and the cliffhanger ending. Considering it&quot;s $2 I expected it to be longer. It really only takes an hour or two to beat. If the talk about a free sequel is true, then my rating will change to 5 stars.
111846446X|5.0|I'm glad that this book was created. It will help most users get the information they need , in order to set up<br />their raspberry Pi computer.
B00992CF6W|1.0|this is lame I wasted 2hours waiting for this to go away but it didn't so I think its a good game I dunno
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun game after you get it figured out. never been a gamer so this id Mindanao cool reminds me of when I had to take care of a digital animal when ibwas small
0786868724|5.0|This little book is an inspiration. Without going into the story, I will say readers today need literature from real life where human beings meet and help one another, their lives inextricably interwoven by destiny. The work of Mitch Albom fills this need. I recommend it for these reasons, and because it is well-written and in handy format.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|No, he may not fit the physical build of the book based character but he sure does pull of the job of being one hell of an action hero in this EXTREMELY fun movie. I used to despise Tom Cruise, all the way up til the first of the Mission Impossible movies I couldnt stand the guy, and being an idiot Scientologist sure didn't make me like him anymore but he has been outstanding in a LARGE number of great movies. From the greatly underappreciated \\"Collateral\\" to this latest venture, Jack Reacher.<br />How on earth does the little fellah not age is what bothers me? Does he take some kind of Scientology injections or what? The \\"kid\\" has got to be closing on 50 I would think......maybe a little less.<br />Maybe its all that Katie Holmes he gets to wallow in that keeps him young!!
B004F1F32A|5.0|I love Liam Neeson in these movies. He makes it almost believable. The daughter was played well and actually behaved just like an awkward teenager. There is a social message behind this movie that is very important. These things really can happen.
B007PKOKTK|5.0|Nice Easter change from the traditional movies.  I would suggest to anyone with little ones.  The animation works well I think
B009YP9L7U|5.0|The characters are energetic and engaging. They worked through the issues and you couldn't help but fall in love with them.
B000GR2R8A|5.0|almost wish it was made into a longer novel but it emcompasses so much that it it still feels as if it was a bigger novel than it really is. This needs a movie production!
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|I am a total Star Trek fan and watched the original series many times as well as the sequels and all of the movies.  I guess you'd say I have a bias towards the franchise.  That said, I was skeptical that anyone could play a young Captain James Tiberius Kirk embodying the characteristics of Kirk as well as Chris Pine ultimately did while he still made the role his own.  He was great and I hope William Shatner agreed.  I feel the same way about the rest of the crew.  I totally enjoyed it and am now looking forward to the new movie coming out this week!
0887431461|5.0|cannot wait to use this book just what i ordered great learning tool.. iam home schooling and this is a great lesson book
B001DUDKEY|5.0|This is not one of Jane Austen's most famous work, but it is a great story.  A love lost , regret, new opportunities, and a<br />family that is a real pain.  True Austen.  The cinematography is not always wonderful, but the main characters give you a real feeling for the words.  A great &#34;chick-flick&#34; especially if you are an Austen fan.  Watch and enjoy.
1892005034|5.0|I cannot say enough about this book. It has changed my life and taught me how to communicate better.  This is the second I buy from him and will not be the last.  It was the best less than 20.00 dollars investment that will reap me rewards in years to come. If you feel you cannot or do not feel you are communicating well with your wife or hubby dubby. Well, here is the answer to your prayers.  Practice it and you will learn it.  I try to practice it on a daily basis.  I will take notes and read them so it becomes second nature to me.  It is a struggle to communicate especially when one's wife feels she is never at fault or wrong.
B0019TSI8W|5.0|I love this movie.  The characters are well written and the casting was perfect.  A little of a Cinderella story, but there is nothing wrong with that.  It gives real encouragement to those of us who are not the classically &#34;pretty girl&#34;, and for everyone who has had a problem finding that &#34;perfect person&#34; to spend their lives with.  This is well worth watching over and over.  Watch and enjoy
B004HAEGP4|5.0|this movie is very entertaining,thereis no movie like it hands down.non stop action & adventure thruoh out the movie,fantastic epics..
B00B7XGFO4|3.0|I do love this love story, but this particular adaptation has flaws.  I think it was a TV movie and the picture quality is so bad, at least on my computer, that it is difficult to watch.  They have also cut some parts of the story that I thought were important to the story line.  If you are a Jane Eyre fan, it is probably worth watching.  I am a George C. Scott fan so that overcomes a lot.  Don't start with high expectations and I think it is okay.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Fun so far....good involvement, good monetization model. Lots to do, not just fishing for your money. Graphics a bit old...but still good and fun to play. More to do than most SIM games
B007M45PMU|4.0|After a few day of listening to this album I have found I really like about half the songs. Over all worth buying they could be a really great band if they do it right on their next album.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Great game has alot of mechanics that work well a bit slow on my kindle fire HD but other than that I love it it gets very addictive aswell
B007ADIRDM|5.0|I bought this for my niece last 2012 Christmas. She was looking for Monster High dolls!  as i remember, i got the shipment very promptly.  The niece is very satisfied!
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|This is a great game to play but there something about this new update says i need to update it i believe i updated game but i still cant get on
B003VW54QO|5.0|This is a wonderful film, with wonderful performances and a wonderful director. If it seems a bit cliche-filled, that's because Rio Bravo set the standard for all westerns that followed. John Wayne is the lawman, Dean Martin is the drunk, Ricky Nelson is the young gun, Angie Dickinson is the femme fatale and Walter Brennan is fabulous as the crusty old character who helps out at the jail. The bad guys think they have John and Dino and the rest of the town trapped and the tension builds to a dramatic conclusion. That's all you need to know. Watch it!
B007VPLNGW|5.0|This game is both entertaining and addictive! Great concept too. It had me hooked the first time I played it.
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|I gave up after chapter 26. I just did not care what happened to anyone enough to even bother skimming the rest of the book. In fact, I no longer believe Amazon ratings. How could this book have received four stars? I respect y'all's opinions but the star count makes me wonder...<br /><br />The story is repetitive.<br /><br />Multisyllabic words include dialog definitions (e.g., like dourly, man, ya know, totally sullen and harsh, ya know what I mean?).<br /><br />Jack Reacher (or was it Ripper? One's a psychopath, the other is?) is beyond arrogant, and his thoughts are clinical as he saws, shoots, tears people to death.<br /><br />Every character other than Jack is willfully dense or oxygen deprived.<br /><br />The Roscoe (a woman not a man cause Jack is in no way gay, right? Sir, yes sir!) must have been abused as a child to fall for a misanthrope such as Jack.<br /><br />Villains are wolf-like, rat-like, ape-like, etc... Personally I think human cruelty needs human adjectives. I respect apes and wolves (not so much rats).<br /><br />Blah, blah, blah. I've wasted enough time on this book.<br /><br />Oh, read one more thing, please?<br /><br />As his first book, Child deserves a mulligan, right? I guess? Maybe? Maybe not? You tell me.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I loved it! It was very exciting, it held my interest and I had trouble putting it down. The writing style is so easy to read - even with all the Swedish names and places. I`m sorry there won't be more volumes.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|I particularly enjoy the interplay between the main characters and the complexity of their relationships which gives them more depth.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|McKenna has done her research and brought forward a story about the horrendous things that went on behind closed doors in Catholic orphanages in Ireland during the first half of the 20th century. Cruelty is not limited to times of war and these wrenching parts were written carefully and with sensitivity.  The story also provides a glimpse of rural Irish life and the continuing struggle of one man who had been adopted out of one of these orphanages.  Scars from theses kinds of experiences last a life time.  I applaud McKenna for providing a satisfying, somewhat happy ending to what could easily have been a horrific tale of morality gone wrong.  This is a powerful and moving story.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Everyone said it was funny, but my boyfriend and I watched it and aside from the funny parts that were shown in the previews, this movie wasn't funny.  I was very disappointed.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Fast paced story line, amazing acting and believeable, compelling characters, what more could I ask for...really well done! Enjoyed it thoroughly and hope to find time for season 2. Yes, I'm hooked!
B0000AM6IY|5.0|purchased for  grandaughters gift and they loved it. will buy again when i want a movie to watch or as a gift
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is great! I play it while listening to music all the time, and it is  and extremely addictive. The graphics are great, and the game doesn't  crash my kindle fire while I play. The advertisements get a little annoying, but it doesn't  take away from the gaming expirience. Plus, it's free, so of you don't like it you didn't spend anything on it anyway. What could be better than that?
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Loved the book...Loved the movie equally...great chemistry between them...Nicholas Sparks definitely knows how to win the audience over with his casting and his words!!!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|you need more fish more pearls and better hints. takes too long to build the reef but the graphics are good
B00785P2QC|4.0|Its a good since it still works while you aren't on and it has all kinds of landmarks and decorations.
B006MGDVFM|4.0|Hard to overstate his impact on a very populous nation at a critical moment in time.  Great movie.  Highly recommend.
B006RXQ1L6|5.0|Love the music and dancing.  It's a fun movie -  a story about a lot of unsavory people - all likeable in their own way
B003PGNBO8|1.0|I have not seen this series. I have purchased many series in the past and have had mixed results. This commentary is based on those cancelled shows that do not have endings. Since I don't get TV reception where<br />I live in rural Alaska, I rely on picking up \\"complete<br />series\\" on DVDs. Now I have learned to carefully read the negative reviews and thus avoid shows that have not resolved any kind of satisfactory ending.<br />  I hope that the movie executives will consider the bottom line of DVD sales when they anticipate a pending cancellation. They will sell many more DVD's if they have the writers compose appropriate endings instead of leaving us viewers hanging.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|This is really very amazing, and especially intriuginge when *SPOILET ALERT* Charlie becomes a man~genious who even at his intuectual rate, has a brain detioriuoration problem and gets sent to the state home. As a fourthgrader i find it......AWESOME!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|To say I really loved this Star Trek movie would be an understatement.  Action from beginning to end with a pretty good story line to boot.  Of course, it stretches what is plausible and possible, but, hey, it's Sci-fi - what seems like fiction now could be the truth in the future.  Who is to say?  I enjoyed seeing the start of several Star Fleet officers' careers (some of my old favorites, since I grew up watching the original Star Trek in the '60s) - like Captain James T. Kirk, Spock, Bones, Scotty, Sulu, Chekhov, Uhura - to name a few.  Also, linking the old (Spock) with the new was fun.  There is much time travel in science fiction (in case you have not noticed - LOL).  All in all, a very enjoyable movie  If your interest is sci-fi and/or fantasy, this movie is for you!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|JJ Abrams version of this iconic series was a glowing success as he managed to bring to life the personalities of the original cast while giving the series a much needed face lift along the way. Chris Pine delivered a strong performance as Captain James T Kirk by portraying the sometimes overly confident, but fearless leader of the USS Enterprise. The pleasant surprise was the depth of which actor Karl Urban delivered Kirk's emotional and often times insubordinate medical chief Leonard \\"Bonds\\" McCoy. This movies delivers the depth of character to welcome home the tried and proven fans of the franchise, but was able to modernize and create a new vision for those who are new to the series. The blend of old and new did not disappoint and sets the series up for a strong run for the next decade.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I had been searching for a Bible app for my Kindle, I read the reviews and decided that this one was perfect for me. It is easy to read and it keeps up with where you stopped reading the day before.
