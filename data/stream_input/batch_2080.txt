B005LAIHXQ|5.0|This is a very good addition to the Alien franchise. It told, yet did not, the genesis of the alien beings and how humanity came to know them. Very cool. Super cool graphics. Good story line. Excellent characters and actors. Just a great film. I do not buy that many DVDs for myself. This one was a must.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|this is a book cover what can I say it is a book cover it covers the book very well this is a book cover it  covers the book
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is one of my favorite games on the kindle fire and its kind of simple.  Minecraft has all of the recipes for you.  Also if you make a big<br />dark room underground, you can have a zombie, skeleton, creeper ( kinda like a walking piece of TNT ), and spider spawner.  Minecraft is my favorite game on the kindle fire.

B000W198QY|5.0|loved the music loved the preformance I would recomend this to any one that lkes southing music that speakes to your soul
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This small sharpener keeps your knives sharps and is small enough and light enough to take camping or throw in a bug out bag.  I use it mostly on kitchen knives but have used it on my hunting knife and swiss army pocket knife as well.  It's very easy to use--though I'd assume it better for keeping a knife sharp (a touchup after every use) than for sharpening a truly dull blade.

0385335989|5.0|If you like historical romance that is heavy on the adventure this book was written for you.  Ironically, I'm not a fan of the romance genre at all, but this series of books provided such excellent adventure and suspense as well as knowledge of herbal lore that they drew me in.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|this book was sent to my wireless kindle the book arived in good order as far as the content in the book it was good
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! Ive always wanted a horse and this gives me that chance. All horse lovers- hlthis is your calling! I absolutely love it and so will you! :)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|loved the books would recomend this book good read glad it was in the kindle must read hate to review book
B002RI9UBS|1.0|It starts off well in the zoo, but I got completely bored with Pi falling in live with every religion he encounters.. I have put it down. a third the way through. I might go back if I get desperate.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely LOVE Subway Surfers!!I play on it 24/7!!!The only problem with it is sometimes a new scene comes on,and everything you earned gets erased!!But I would still give it 5 stars :)
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Funny from beginning to end. The old man is so accepting of whatever comes his way. What a way to live your life!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Really fun. More advanced graphics than the first one. Freezes and force closes sometimes when using the `save me` option.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this game does what it is supposed to. easy to play, looks decent, and is loads of fun. Always mygo to game.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun game keeps you coming back for more. My three year old enjoys playing it too.  Need more games like this.
B00516G6ME|5.0|This is a very large figure and the detail is superb. The Metalic Paint for his shoulders look great. Be very careful not to lose the sunglasses the figure comes with, they do not snap on his head  they rest on his head.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game SO much. I wish I could play it 24 /7. When is the up-date coming?  My friends ipod already has it so I wonder when for kindle.
B009LYQE2E|5.0|If you are not familiar with Figuart Zero figures then let it be known that the size is not very large, but it still has a great amount of detail and fantastic color. The base is a very cool red color rather than the black ones i am used to. Very Happy with this Film Z version of Luffy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love how realistic the game is. It is very interactive. it keeps you wanting to play. you actually get to train ur horse.
B004V5QWU2|1.0|This was a disappointment.  Disruptive The loop skips. Not pleasant listening because of the obvious skips. The App should say does not work well on Kindle Fire HD.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love how this game is so additive. I try to play it every chance I have. I recommend anybody to download this game
B007THA4FI|3.0|A book club read<br /><br />I don't remember if it was an Amazon or Goodreads review that said this book was like the movie It's A Wonderful Life if Jimmy Stewart had actually died in the beginning instead of going the 'what if I never existed' route. I think that's a pretty accurate description. One man's death set off a series of events and decisions that changed the lives of all the characters that live in these pages.<br /><br />At the end of the day, it was just ok. All right. Nothing spectacular. I haven't read any of the Harry Potter books, so I can't compare or contrast the writing styles and storylines, though I'm sure you can find approximately 5000 people doing that on this site alone.<br /><br />It earns about 3.5 stars from me. It's nothing to write home about and better books are definitely available that deal with similar subject matter.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|This is one of the CD's I've heard in a long time.  If your a Bruno Mars fan this is a must have for you.
0345803507|5.0|Again this book was great fun to read and laugh at diffferent things.I read the book in about a week.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app and so do my kids. very good..glitches free and realistic. highly recommended . wish it was easier to receive or get gems but still a great app
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I like the books I order can read them when I want ,and always have them to take on road or trip.
0345803493|5.0|I read the book it very good and it was hard to stop reading in the evening. Enjoy for I have not read a book for some time.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|Not as good as going to the computer and looking up something but not really that bad really if you have a little time trying to find something.
B009K0P10K|5.0|one of my most fav shows!  Excitement, intrigue and drama!  Can't wait for next season!  IF you haven;t seen this show, you must watch!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Man!!! What a great writer! I was pulled in immediately. Mostly because the style was unique, but as I kept reading I realize I was having definite emotional reactions about the characters and their actions.<br /><br />Very good. Read in 2 days.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|Kimberly Perry and her brothers are excellent in this CD! My favorite, in particular is &#34;If I Die Young&#34;.  Recommended to all who enjoy good music, my son introduced me to this CD.
B008Y7DTJA|5.0|HD version of Fly Away Home was worth the extra $5 over the cost of the SD version.  Beautiful scenes and story.  Thanks Amazon!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I thought that it was great and fun. More people should be able to get subway surfers. I love it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great romantic story....very detailed.  Paints a picture with his words and makes you fall in love with all the characters.
B009NYF2ES|5.0|I tend to agree with the American Film Institute (AFI) with their list choices.  All top 25 musicals on that list deserve to be there. \\"Cabaret\\" deserves it's place at #5 in the musicals category.  Love Liza or not, it is a breakthrough, ahead of it's time masterpiece.  I ordered the movie on Amazon as the availability in stores was nill.  Shameful.  I can't wait to see how glorious it looks once it arrives.  My top cocktail movie (movies to enjoy cocktails to).  My Piper is waiting to be popped!
B007SGM084|5.0|This series offers the reader a great deal.  Not only is it a great love story, it is funny, touching and very sensual.  I really loved the characters, the twists and intrigue.  Every woman in the world would loved a piece of Christian Grey......issues and all.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|I couldn't be happier with the product. It arrived on time and works flawlessly. I used it to extend my usb headset across the room and my sound quality remains immaculate. I am told my mic sounds incredible. I am very impressed that the active cable did not decrease my audio quality at all. I opted to buy this over some of the cheaper models on amazon and I am glad that I did.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I would laugh out loud during most every chapter! I felt like I was having a conversation with Ellen or I was at her show. Highly recommend!
B0049DRH28|5.0|The piece is set in the mid-1800s, during the first great surge of the industrial revolution.  The filmmakers succeed in making us see the huge, overwrought machines of the day as artifacts of futuristic science fiction. The characters are of course cartoons in every sense, but character is not what drives this film, and the characters are distinctive enough to serve their respective purposes.  This movie is never less than vastly entertaining, and sometimes awe-inspiring.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|the game is realistic enough for me since I ride horses. I think its fun to play and good for passing time.
034580404X|5.0|I read the books, but bought this set as a gift.<br />They avid reader loves this set. Great book. Must read.
B008LODRT8|5.0|I am not done yet but so far i am loving it! I cant believe a long way christian has come and he is so romantic
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|I didn't know much about Bruno Mars before I scanned his music videos on YouTube, but I saw him on the 2012 Grammy Awards show and found him intriguing.  I downloaded the MP3 and came away impressed with his versatility.  It's not going to break any musical barriers, but this album has a lot of songs that are fun to listen to, energetic and sweet.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is a popular app and is... Well AWESOME!! But it would be better if it was faster to upload stuff
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Keeps you on edge and in your seat.  It's the good and bad of human nature. Worth every penny :-) .
B008M87GJK|5.0|I have always appreciated the across the pond coverage on certain things because they seem to be unhindered by certain restraints we have here. At least a different view point is always helpful. As far as world news coverage is concerned BBC seems to do a great job in getting the news out there. Customize the feed to your interest from a variety of topics and a large number of them will have video attachments as well.
B005LAII6C|4.0|A little on the weird side, but as with most kids movies, a good story to learn from. Great in 3D!
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Ha, if this was on tv as a youth it would have been like when Porky's came out. Lines around the block. If you do not get that reference you are to young. Typical Depp, funny in a dark way.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|One of my favorite movies! A great movie to add to my romance collection that I have. It arrived quickly and as advertised.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|The plot is quite believable and the cast pulls it off. It highlights a couple that have traveled a long road together and we get into these routines. However change is good and no matter what cement may be weighing us down it can be chiseled away. I grew up watching these two and perhaps I feel as though they are like part of my family, an aunt and uncle maybe. Either way they played there parts very well.<br />And no my wife did not force me to write this review, it was Amazon. LOL!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|We love this movie and had to purchase it for our collection. We received it quickly and as advertised. I would recommend this purchase to others.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Certainly not for kids but likely closer to how it was originally told. Somewhat dark at times but the visuals were done well. Worth watching.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|My son was looking for this movie all over town and we finally found it on line! It is one of his favorites and he watches it over and over again. A great addition to his movie collection.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Well done and quite a unique app. You become the artist and watch the figure you drew come to life. Eventually I could see them add more animation to facial movements and the like.
B000WC3A0S|5.0|I have always been a Rocky Fan and had to add this to my collection. It is very nicely packaged and well priced. It arrived quickly and as advertised.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Who doesn't like post its, now they are digital. This app is good for jotting,reminding and remembering what we need to.
B0004Z33G4|5.0|I've always been a Rambo fan and when I saw the trilogy collection on line and priced well I had to add it to my collection. Arrived quickly and as advertised.
B004Y1USV2|5.0|Proof that this band still has legs even when one of their most important members goes missing.  &#34;Fly From Here&#34; includes some of the most progressive tracks the band has released in a long time.  &#34;Bumpy Ride&#34; is a fun jaunt and &#34;Life On a Film Set&#34; is full-on PROG that toggles between 6/8 - 5/8 throughout.  (Or is it 6/8 -7/8?  Now have to play it again!)<br /><br />The whole album's good!  I look forward to anything else they chose to release.
B000UR9T8W|5.0|We are marvel fans in our house hold and this was a great set for the price that I couldn't pass up. It arrived quickly and as advertised. I love the box that it is packaged in!
B004KBSQBA|5.0|I saw the recent movie (also available here) about Paul revisiting South Africa on the aniversary of this release.  That was where I first heard the demo that lead to the track &#34;Homeless&#34;.  Getting to have the full track on here is fun and likely to be played directly before the more developed &#34;Homeless&#34; that came out on the album as the two go so well together.<br /><br />The whole album is a lot of fun.
B002GSXKN8|5.0|We are comic fans in our house hold and this was a great set for the price that I couldn't pass up. It arrived quickly and as advertised.
B003J27WFW|5.0|Probably the single best rockumentary about any band ever.  This really gives you the full inside story of the bands rise to stardom - dispite their refusal to cowtow to their publishers demands.  WELL DONE!
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|i just hate this game.it just sucks.you should not get it.it is a complete waste of time.never ever ever ever ever get this game!!!!!!
B007EECSFA|5.0|The Secret Keeper is well written, compelling, and historically interesting. It's a great read and has a fascinating plot twist. Don't miss it. I'll be reading more of Kate Morton's work.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Great App.Love the detailed info, and ability to customize. You can set alarms, turn off at nite, change battery color, and even tells you how long to recharge.
B00844PIRO|5.0|Excellently written and so very entertaining.  All about mid century farming, animals and rural folk.  Highly recommended. Many more books by same author.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a great casual game!!  I have not spent one red sent on this game,and I'm on level 30. I play on my kindle fire and have no problems at all. My daughter also has it on her tablet. Works great on hers too!! You have to be patience!!!  People that have no patience need not to download this, you will get frustrated. I AM SOOOO ADDICTED!!!!  Great graphics too!!! It does have where u can purchase stuff with real money so for little ones I would disable this feature. Thanks game loft for a great game!!! You got this one right!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very additive game like the graphics all the horses look very cool . Not glitche or nothing runs very smooth
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great pocket edition of their favorite game.  Keeps them busy on the long car trips to visit relatives.<br /><br />Works without a hitch.  Download was fast and easy.  They'd play it all day if I didn't limit computer/Kindle time.
B000IZ8DZQ|4.0|One may wonder how a soft-spoken and seemingly quite ordinary Troy Kennedy-Martin (screenwriter) could concoct so elaborate and devious a plot as this. “Wow” serves the purpose of reacting to the intricacies of the dynamics of his scheme. And someone had gone as far as inventing a guide to the most original and bizarre alternate routes through and around the city of Turin. Michael Caine, as ever, carries off his facility to portray a lovable rogue; and who could not adore Benny Hill being Benny Hill?<br />Of course, Noel Coward adds a most British counterbalance to the visual, as well as that matchless English penchant for absurdity.<br />Perhaps the many elaborate heist stories, both earlier and later, may slightly dull the novelty of the general theme, and despite the discontinuities in the production, director Peter Collinson managed to get a great deal from his cast and to come out with what is arguably not a classic, but at least 99 minutes of G-rated fun.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It's free, it works.  Scoring system is screwy, but it's not like it really matters.  Fun time waster.  Can't beat the price.
B00B01XDTI|5.0|Just bought the movie yesterday and I'm glad I did , it was awesome . You must buy this cool movie . Not bad price either
B005CKPQNE|5.0|The video was clear with no glitches I love this show and I enjoy watching it with amazon .... Cant wait for the final season ... thanks
B005LAJ17M|5.0|This is a great seies.  Fast moving and compelling.  I loved watching it all at once and not waiting from week to week for the next episode

B000V39KDO|5.0|This is my fave movie in LIFE. So happy i bought it.. DVD arrived in great condition. Thanks Amazon! This is Spartaaaaaaaaaaa! :-)
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|Why does it have to be the demo?I would like to have some time to work on the house @ least.I still like it.
0316069434|3.0|I have all of Michael Connelly's books. If &#34;The Black Box&#34; had been my first and only one, I would have missed many (most) of his  others.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This the best game ever played its better than temple run it also gets regular updates really reliable game has no glitches like temple run
B008RXYOKY|4.0|It's great to pay a reasonable price for a product you need. I don't notice any terrific speed with attached items but I needed extra options this gave me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I play it 24/7 it is amazing I love the the new girl Carmen from Rio and I'm up to 2 million coins wish me luck
B005OCHOZS|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a fellow runner and I have not been disappointed.  What an incredible story of dedication to one's passion and principles.  Wonderful recipes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really enjoying this game. Really easy to play.Wish they would let you choose your starter horse. But otherwise so far I like how it doesn't take long to complete activities.
B0055PMURG|5.0|This is a story that is well worth the money spent on it. My great granddaughter who is four years old has watched this movie several times and asks to watch it every time she comes to my house.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app rules its so fun you must get this awesome sauce app because if you love horseys zebras or unicorns you will love this app!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I asked my niece to tell me of a game to get for my newly bought kindle fire. Subway Surfers was her immediate reply. I've been hooked since then. Hint Learn how to do the missions.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I liked it because it shows you the temperature per hour in your area and precipitation percentage that day. No problems so far.
B0067R0APK|4.0|I have this app on both kindle fire and my droid phone.  Never have any problems with it working. I would reccomend it. I have the paid app cause I hats ads.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|good story but I kept waiting for a shoe to drop, but it never did. Did like how he was able to outthink the government.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|top notch application that you will end up wondering how you used your phone without it! Also after using this app be sure to consider getting the pro version as its not only worth it but by supporting the designers will allow them to upgrade & add not only more and better features but new apps of this calibur also!

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show! Thanks you Amazon for offering the first half of the season! I am now ready to see the rest!
B0067QPVD2|4.0|Maybe I was nodding off or having a bad day the first time I saw this film because I remember feeling ho hum about it. The second time I watched it on blu ray I really liked it and became more engrossed in the nuances. I'm a huge fan of the 1982 Thing (as well as the 1951 version)so I believe I come at this being a hard core skeptic. As with the 1983 film this version has a very real dynamic going on between the cloistered players. Mary Elizabeth Winstead impressed the heck out of me portraying an outwardly bland scientist that invokes inner strength when confronted with fear. As well, her fear is genuine.<br /><br /> Many already know this 2011 version is a prequel. I didn't think the Norwgian camp needed to be revisited but, my predilections aside, it worked very well. Many of the actors are big Norwegian film stars. One was referred to as the \\"Brad Pitt\\" of Norway in the dvd extras. The film basically holds to what our minds remember the creature being in the \\"82 masterpiece and that goes a long way. I do agree with some reviewers that one or two CGI scenes were somewhat weak but it could also be that I am so used to the thing being \\"live action\\" that the CGI just throws me off for this type of creature. I would also say that some necessary dark scenes leaned a little too dark for me. I also don't understand why the film was given the title \\"The Thing\\". Remakes are usually entitled the same, not prequels or sequels. This could have been \\"The Thing- A Beginning\\" or something like that. I think the marketers needed this title to sell it to newer audiences.<br /><br />The movie doesn't have the memorable lines that the classic has but I can't forget the line, \\"be careful, that thing went through the ------ roof\\" (lol). Seeing the creatures space ship could have sunk the film but wisely this area was handled smoothly and added greater fascination. Kate's outcome left me a bit more wanting but I can live with it. What needs to happen now is the sequel to the 82 film that many are salivating for. The Thing is not done yet.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like subway surfers because it's for got loads of different subjects like RIO and on every different subject there's a limited character for the subject. I think everybody should play subway surfers!!I REALLY DO!!
B000HWZ4CA|4.0|typical of the era, acting tends to be a bit overacted.  That isn't the point of my review.<br /><br />The American and British soldiers uniforms are fairly accurate for that period of 1917-18.  HOWEVER, I was very surprised that the German soldiers, as well as the German Field officers uniforms were from the 1937-1940 era.  The soldiers uniforms were virtually identical to the WWII field uiforms, and they were far better taklored than your average German alldiers uniform was in WWI.  The same boes for ghe German officers uniforms.  The hats are definately WWII, as are the jackets.  Another point are the boots, they are mst definately WWII issues. The weaponry is accurate, but the field belt and ammo pouch......WWII.<br /><br />This probably wouldn't even be ticeable to most folks.  I have been an unofficial near experton German uniforms since my late teens....Always thought they were, by far, the sharpest military uniforms thru all history.<br /><br />The movie was enjoyable, altho I am a bit skeptical as to its accuracy,  regarding as to Sgt York actually sid eveything the movie claims he did.....and exactly as they claim he did.  I think it's more of movie over dramatization.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The app is really fun, but both my sister and I keep having the same problem. We'll be playing and lose a round, then check our money, and half of it is gone! It is still a pretty good game as long as you don't mind never having enough money to buy another runner person.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I believe Temple Run 2 is alright. I like the scenes and the hills. What I don't like though is the way you get the powerups. I can never get them! I don't like the mine shaft either. My kindle freezes sometimes when I'm trying to jump and then it doesn't sense that I jump. I know its the game and not my kindle because my friend says hers does that too with Temple Run 2 only. Overall I would reccommend the old Temple Run before this one but this oneis pretty fun too.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a fun game though I was irritated when my multiplyer got erased making me start over completely but other than that it is addicting.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|The FiiO D3 Digital to Analog Audio Converter worked out of the box. My audio issues were immediately solved. Easy to setup. I used Velcro to attached the ADC unit to back of TV and an unused USB port to power the converter.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's nice to have a horse like this instead of a real one.a real one would require more money and attention. Plus the graphics are impressive. Well done who ever came up with game
B0053O89IS|5.0|Have all the seasons, had to buy this one.  I'm glad it was available.  Had the best pricing of all the places I checked.
B0053O89JM|5.0|Loved the series when it was on tv, and have all the other seasons.  Had to buy this one too.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Loved it. The songs will stick in your head for days and Anna Kendrick will be a huge star now!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this game. fantastic game for horse lovers graphics are amazing too. I am definitely recommending it to all of my friends
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is absolutely wonderful I recommend this for all ages but more taped age 8-16. This really teaches responsibility.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|loved this game had a really fun time playing with my trickster I rate this game 5 stars for every aspect of it
B00B2V66VS|4.0|mine glitches just like some of my other friends ...it might get fixed but other wise this game is amazing<br />.<br />I have scored more than four million in 1 game (y)

B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have used the free version, White Noise Lite, for two years. It's great, but the paid version is absolutely worth it! White Noise not only gives you abundant choices and options, it allows you to play the sound of your choice while you're doing other things with your device. (The free version and other white noise apps stop playing the sounds as soon as you leave the screen to do anything else.) This is great for me, because I like to turn on my selected sound and then play a word game until I'm sleepy. All I have to do is end the word game and I'm all set!<br /><br />I love the high quality of the sounds. I am very sensitive to sounds, and I can't stand it when I can hear the repetitive loop every 2-3 seconds. I lie there listening to the repetition instead of going to sleep. With White Noise, the sounds seem to go infinitely. There may be some kind of loop, but I can't hear it.<br /><br />Finally, I  love the many, many sound choices White Noise offers. At the moment, Pink Noise is my favorite, but I plan to try others.<br /><br />Thank you, developers, for an excellent app!

0812973992|4.0|This book was in many ways a study of beauty in the ashes - beauty that can be found in the most desolate of places, including 1970s New York City! And yet - the contrast might be especially stark there, but isn't the entire world a study in these contrasts if you look closely enough?<br /><br />It is also about how we are all linked together, in part, by an appreciation of beauty and its pursuit.  It was a stunningly wonderful idea to tie all the stories together with the tightrope walker, who united all New Yorkers in an extraordinary moment of awe and hush.  And yet - years later, we also were all united again in a terrifying moment of anguish looking up at those same towers.  United in the recognition of beauty, united in the experience of ashes and pain.  In that respect, this novel is a marvelous work of poetry.<br /><br />Evidence from a few characters:<br />\\"What Corrigan wanted was a fully believable God, one you could find in the grime of the everyday. The comfort he got from the hard, cold truth--the filth, the war, the poverty--was that life could be capable of small beauties.\\"<br /><br />Of paintings destroyed in the rain: \\"But then I started looking through them. And they were beautiful and ruined.\\"<br /><br />Why the walker walked: \\"The core reason for it all was beauty. Walking was a divine delight. Everything was rewritten when he was up in the air. New things were possible with the human form. It went beyond equilibrium. He felt for a moment uncreated. Another kind of awake.\\"<br /><br />A judge assessing the city: \\"Every now and then the city shook its soul out. It assailed you with an image, or a day, or a crime, or a terror, or a beauty so difficult to wrap your mind around that you had to shake your head in disbelief.\\"<br /><br />On why a young lady kept an photo of the tightrope walk: \\"The photo was taken on the same day her mother died--it was one of the reasons she was attracted to it in the first place: the sheer fact that such beauty had occurred at the same time.\\"<br /><br />And there's more where that came from...a study of real beauty in the real world.<br /><br />Why not 5 stars?

B00005Y1TL|4.0|Selected Ambient Works 85-92 was the debut album of Aphex Twin, the moniker of Richard D. James. Throughout his teenage years (he was only 21 upon the release of this collection that already looks back years), James had explored producing intricate and hypnotic dance patterns from what was then primitive equipment.<br /><br />Those hearing this for the first time well into the new millennium should not expect to be blown away by this record. I myself expected something life-changing, as I had read critical buzz from the 1990s when this was touted as a staggering work of singular genius and surely the future of music. In fact, the IDM of Aphex Twin and other Warp Records arists entered the mainstream and attracted myriad epigones. The big rock act Radiohead, for example, employed the genre on KID A, and with maturing technology any teenage would-be house producer could make these sounds in his bedroom, not just savants like James. It got to the point where this sound no longer seemed innovative. Indeed, the latter half of this record evokes strongly for me Sasha's AIRDRAWNDAGGER, which upon its release in 2002 came as a disappointment to some who said \\"Is that all?\\"<br /><br />But this debut is consistently enjoyable, and if one is willing to imagine a teenager painstakingly evoking ambient electronic soundscapes when few had such skill, impressive. The tracks are invariably in 4/4 time and squarely reflect the acid house scene. Indeed, \\"Hedphlym\\" and \\"Actium\\" go on for rather longer than they should, but this may be intentional to give DJs room to mix them into a set. Only \\"Green Calx\\" has the schizoid breaks that would later be a prominent feature of his style and suggest Mr James has an wonderfully unsound mind.

B000FC1KBG|2.0|I am a former Baby Wise parent of a now 6-year-old.  Baby Wise worked like a miracle for him but I absolutely hated every minute of it.  Our son was either 5 or 8 months old when I finally broke down and tried the method.  After 3 miserable days, we had a relatively easy baby to deal with.  He had set expectations and it was easy to get him to go about his routine without excessive rocking, holding, etc.<br /><br />Because that was so miserable, for our newborn, I thought I'd read the \\"Secrets of the Baby Whisperer.\\"  Hogg's theory is a gentle version of Baby Wise - some crying but far less.  She also has a strikingly similar approach to soothing an unhappy baby as \\"The Happiest Baby on the Block.\\"  She's changed minor details of the soothing method detailed in that book but she completely disagrees with the premise of that book of extreme attachment parenting.<br /><br />I completely agree with her theories of how to soothe an unhappy baby and the E.A.S.Y. (eat, activity, sleep) routine.  (However, the \\"Y\\" stands for \\"Yourself,\\" meaning time for yourself and I think that one is a little silly.  Of course I'm going to do things I want when the baby is sleeping - I don't need an acronym to remind me that I'm sleepy too).  This is the exact same philosophy as Baby Wise and it keeps new mothers from nursing or feeding baby to sleep - which can become a real problem very quickly.<br /><br />However, while most people found the book easy to read, I found it to be a dreadful read.  I read it from cover to cover first and couldn't tell you much about how to actually implement the plan.  Then I tried to use it as a reference book to find a section on deciphering cries.  The descriptions are minimal and simplistic.  I couldn't figure out how to apply that knowledge at all in our situation.  It's entirely possible that I'm too close to the situation to objectively read the correct cues but I would appreciate more detailed information instead of two paragraph anecdotes about other babies.  The \\"real life\\" examples seem a little contrived but there is so little information in them that I found them to be more page-fillers than containing helpful bites of knowledge.  The text also jumps around a lot and refers to itself an extreme amount.  You'll be reading about personality categories in an early chapter and it'll reference something strange like how to swaddle in a far later chapter.  Because it doesn't stay on topic very well, in my sleep-deprived state, the book had trouble holding my attention.<br /><br />Also, there are several pages dedicated to self-evaluation.  There is even a quiz to determine if you're a planner or a wing-it type.  I suspect that we all know, without a Cosmo-style quiz, whether we plan or not. This again was just page filler and I can't see how it helped to implement her plan at all.  Naturally, if you're a planner, any baby schedule is going to be easier for you to implement.  I don't need a chapter telling me something that should be common sense.<br /><br />If you set a goal for yourself of putting your baby on a routine like eating every 3 hours, some activity after then naps, you'll do just as well as if you read the entire book.  I think I might go back and reread \\"Baby Wise\\" and try to implement it gently instead of trying to decode any more baby cues or study this book any further.ther babies.

B008AK8FHM|1.0|I agree with all the 1 star reviews I read here. If you're curious, it's a good one to borrow from your library. I agree that too much time is spent telling of his condition on earth, and too little detail about the supposed revelations that he received from \\"God\\". His NDE is most unusual compared to the many cases featured in the book \\"Evidence of the Afterlife\\" by Dr. Jeffrey Long, who didn't have an NDE himself but has studied thousands of cases throughout decades, and has come to some very interesting conclusions. People's many different cases offer us more insight into the afterlife than Dr. Eben Alexander's alone. You don't need to be a neuro-surgeon to have an NDE.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is a joy to see such a talented ensemble cast given the gift of excellence in directing, script-writing, editing, videography, music scoring, and costuming.  Most all of the stories are compelling and keep the momentum of the series moving along with interesting twists that keep my interest piqued.  Though I won't give it away, the only disappointment I've had is the Season 3 ending, which was predictable given what I've read about a certain cast member's imminent departure, but is a shame both from the prospect of the loss of the character as well as the way it was handled.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|This sharpener is easy to use, small, and light weight.<br />It's not ideal for everyday use because its tough to get a good grip.

I get the impression that it might break apart if I dropped it hard or stepped on it.

B00000420F|5.0|In many ways, this is a very simple CD, featuring Cecilia Bartoli as her voice was back in 1992 (Decca re-issued this in 2005) Arie antiche are a collection of pieces, put together at the end of the nineteenth century, which were designed to train classical singers in vocal smoothness, control, pitching, ornamentation and expressiveness, particularly in the Baroque tradition - or at least the baroque tradition filtered through late nineteenth century vision. So we have pieces by Scarlatti, Vivaldi, Giordani, Paisello - all Italian baroque<br /><br />Simply arranged with only an accompanying piano, there is no where for the singer to hide<br /><br />The CD comes with an accompanying booklet with the words of each aria in Italian and translated into English<br /><br />In Bartoli's hands (or most properly larynx pharynx et al) these are far far more than the vocal equivalent of practicing scales, they are intensely musical pieces in their own right which will reveal both the strength and the weakness of the singer.<br /><br />Listen, for example to the utterly haunting Caro mio ben, by Giordani, where Bartolo's rich but never florid mezzo caresses this love song. What lover could fail to melt, and 'put an end to this coldness' as the singer implores! Lotti's Pur dicesti o bocca bella, a little song in praise of the lover's kissable mouth is splendidly flirtatious and seductive. I could go on, pulling out track after track to enthuse over, - of the 21 tracks, about half are, in my opinion, as pieces of music, quite stunning. And all are breathed into life by Bartoli's deliciously un-strained, flexible vocals. She strokes, not stabs, the listener's ears

B001BEK8E2|5.0|Rashomon was a Japanese film made in 1950 when Japan was still considered a backwater cinematically.  It won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival and eventually the Oscar for Best Foreign Film and Best Director from the National Board of Review.  The movie is a combination two stories one in which a buddhist monk, a woodcutter and eventually a farmer are sheltering in the Rashomon gate of Kyoto during a rainstorm.  The monk and the woodcutter begin telling a disturbing tale which the farmer listens to with interest.  They had witnesses a trial of a thief who was accused of murdering a lord who was traveling through the forest with his wife.  The story is told in three parts, the thief tells his story, the wife hers and a medium tells the husband/murder victims story.  Much of it involves the rape of the wife who has an interest because she is considered disgraced by the rape and a lack of status.  Was she willingly \\"raped\\" by the thief?  Did she end up humiliated by both men who saw her as worthless after the act?  Or did the husband see her encourage the thief to kill him so there would be no witness to her shame?  What of a baby that seems to be abandoned at the gate?  A very moving film that proved Japan as a powerhouse in cinema and Kurosawa as one of the greatest directors ever.

B007THA4FI|3.0|I really love the imaginative Harry Potter series, but I found Ms. Rowlings writing for adults very one dimensional.  Everyone has their own personalities, negitive and positive but Ms. Rowlings definately chose to express the down side of life and with only the negitive ideas expressed.  Even in the worst life, people are not as negitive and shallow, as Ms. Rowling expresses.
0060853972|5.0|Neil Gaiman (Sandman, Stardust, American Gods, Neverwhere). Terry Pratchett (Discworld. 'Nuff said). Two of the few authors whose entire bibliographies I will read without question. And here they worked on something together, way back before either hit it big? This is a novel not to be missed! In Good Omens we follow a fallen angel who never really got on board with the whole \\"evil\\" thing and his \\"opposite number\\" who are both confronted with the fact that the Apocalypse is growing near; the Antichrist has been born. Except that neither of them are particularly thrilled about the world coming to an end--they're both quite fond of it! We have as well an apprentice witchfinder, and his new girlfriend (a witch....awkward....) who is in possession of the only copy of the book Good Omens, The Nice And Accurate Prophesies Of Agnes Nutter, Witch--the only 100% accurate book of prophecy in the history of the world. It too is calling for the end of the world. And last but not least, we have a young boy unaware of his diabolical heritage who wants nothing but to be a kid. Also making their appearances: satanic nuns, the Four Bikers Of The Apocalypse, commentary on the resemblances between an infant and Churchill, and the diabolical secret behind the construction of freeways.

1439156816|4.0|Stephen King, a true master of his art, expounds at length on various topics related to writing--particularly fiction, seeing as that's what he knows. He begins with a pseudo-memoir, focusing on events that shaped him into the writer he became. From there he talks about the various \\"tools\\" a writer must be able to use, and how to go about honing these tools. Much of what he says here is great (Rule one: Read a lot, and write a lot), while some of what he says seems to be more individual to him and his style/methodology than universal. For example, he says outlining your story in advance is a crutch that will stifle your writing. That may very likely be true of the stories he writes, but I don't think that every writer should take this advice. (Which isn't to advocate being a slave to your outline--you CAN change the thing....) But then, what do I know. He's the one who's published.....

1401225756|5.0|Neil Gaiman is one of those authors whose brilliance forces one to track down and read their entire body of work. I haven't yet acheived this, but I'm working on it. My current target: The Sandman and all the related works, regarded by many as one of the finest examples of graphic storytelling that exists so far.<br /><br />Volume I: Preludes And Nocturnes begins the Sandman epic. Accidentally conjured by a society of wannabe-sorcerers attempting to cage Death, Morpheus, Lord of the Dreaming is kept imprisoned for nearly a century. When he manages to escape, it is to find his realm in shambles and his tools of office gone. Now Morpheus must track down his stolen property in order to reclaim the power to rebuild his realm and restore order to the Dreaming. From the depths of Hell to the infinite possibilities of the Dreaming, Preludes and Nocturnes takes the reader on an epic quest and introduces some of the most interesting characters in comics--The Endless. These seven beings--Dream/Morpheus, Death, Destiny, Destruction, Desire, Despair, and Delirium--are the personifications of their respective concepts and fulfill their associated duties. Dream oversees the Dreaming, a realm that is somehow made up of, the source of, and created by the collective dreams of all living things. Death escorts the souls of the departed into the afterlife. Destiny oversees the course of all existence, and so on and so forth. Gaiman continues to flesh out these characters throughout the course of this seminal series.

0441013597|5.0|Dune is commonly cited as the world's bestselling sci-fi novel. Many also argue that it is the greatest. While I myself will not make that claim (I've read far too many excellent novels to ever even consider picking just one) I find myself disinclined to argue with that statement. I will say that Frank Herbert's masterpiece is by far the most imaginative work of sci-fi I've ever picked up.<br /><br />Good science fiction walks a tightrope between making things too familiar and making them relateable. Dune somehow manages both. The world of Dune is a human empire that stretches across the stars, yet functions in a very feudalistic manner. It's somewhere abouts the year 10,000 and everything has changed, from science to technology to religion, and all of it described so that if you're vigilant you can really learn a lot about this world. At the same time, for the most part Herbert avoids the dreaded \\"people telling each other things they should already know\\" pitfall.<br /><br />The novel begins on Caladan, a watery planet ruled by Duke Leto Atreides and his family, the concubine Lady Jessica and their son Paul Atreides. You quickly learn that a.) things are not as they seem with House Atreides' move from their traditional home on Caladan to be \\"rewarded\\" with control of Arrakis, a desert planet where moisture is so precious its natives (and anyone venturing outside the cities) are forced to wear \\"stillsuits\\" that reclaim the body's otherwise-lost moisture, a planet where workers harvesting the precious melange spice have to dodge the gigantic sandworms that roam the desert and will swallow a mining facility whole. And b.) you learn that there are some mighty strange inhabitants of this future society we are being shown. There are the Fremen, the native inhabitants of the deserts of Arrakis and a force not to be underestimated. There are the Bene Gesserit, an order that mostly resembles the Aes Sedai of Robert Jordan'sWheel Of Time series (Anyone? No? Okay, they're anall-female Jedi Order. Better?) and have been manipulating the various noble houses' lineages in hopes of creating their (for lack of a better word) messiah-an aim they may or may not have achieved with the birth of young Paul. There are the Harkonnens, another noble House locked in an age-old feud with House Atreides and the previous rulers of Arrakis. There is the Guild, the organization that controls all space travel and answers to no one but themselves, not even the Padishah Emperor himself. There are the Mentats, men trained to be intensely logical reasoning machines (for all mechanical intelligences such as computers are taboo after an ill-defined war in the distant past) who are nevertheless still governed by the most basic rule of computing-garbage in, garbage out.<br /><br />I cannot say much more without giving away plot details. What I will say is that the novel is meticulously plotted, an intricate weave of political maneuvering in a system that doesn't actually exist outside of the imagination. The complexity is astounding, and leads to my one real caution about the book-its not for the faint of heart. The book requires your complete concentration or you will get completely lost and have to go back to find what details you missed. As such, and to facilitate such intricate interactions between the characters, Herbert ditches the literary convention of having a single POV character for any given scene. You may find yourself, in the course of a seemingly meaningless coversation between six or seven people over dinner, in the head of every person present in order to more clearly understand what is going on and where their minds are going with the multiple layers of subtext. It's done well, but it makes the book a bit more challenging than it would otherwise be. Additionally, there is a lot of new vocabulary you will have to learn. Fortunately, Herbert does a good job of defining things in the text without being annoying-I actually found the glossary in theback distracting after a while for anything but going back to double-check meanings I was already supposed to have learned.<br /><br />There is a good deal of violence throughout the book, though I didn't find it gratuitous. Likewise sexual innuendo. Its there, it just isn't necessarily stuck in your face or played for obscenity. There may have been some language, I really don't recall. If you're old enough to make it through Dune in all other regards, I doubt you'll find it problematic.<br /><br />So yeah. Dune is technically the first work in a series, though I've had conflicting reports on how far through the series I should read. Some reccomend stopping here. Others say that Dune Messiah and Children of Dune are also worthwhile, completing Herbert's originally-conceived trilogy. I'll probably pause there for a while before moving on to the other sequels and prequels done in the ages since, if only because the initial trilogy was all I found at that garage sale last year. I haven't read any but the initial work yet, but thus far I can heartily recommend!
B001USHRCK|5.0|The details are incedibile.  The mill wheel turns and works the interior of the blacksmith shop.  Even the oven has an exhaust and grate where the make believe smoke would go.  One the tables is hollow and holds a gold lego coin.  It is expensive, but it gets played with over and again.
0062225677|5.0|Terry Pratchett's Discworld does for Fantasy what Douglas Adams's Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy did for science fiction--firmly sets a story within a genre, stereotypes intact, then goes to town. This is the first book in the series, and therein we follow the failed wizard Rincewind as he acts as the reluctant guide for Twoflower, the Discworld's first tourist. Taking on everything from Conan to D&D, this is definitely a series to check out if you have any interest in the fantasy genre whatsoever.....or are just in need of a good laugh for any reason whatsoever....
B00846REIS|4.0|At first this book might seem quite like 50 shades of grey, but then it develops to something new, specially in book 2 (reflected in you - my fav by the way..). Hot, romantic and problematic.. really good mixture. I would recommend this book, specially to read the second book of the trilogy.
0062225715|5.0|Terry Pratchett's Discworld does for Fantasy what Douglas Adams's Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy did for science fiction--firmly sets a story within a genre, stereotypes intact, then goes to town. Mort is the fourth book in the series, but stands on its own pretty well. Rincewind and the Unseen University make a minor appearance, and Death has appeared in the previous books, but other than that its pretty self-contained. Although the rules governing how Death operates don't really jive with what happened in The Colour Of Mag--*Slap!* Don't think about it! Death comes to all men in their time, but when he comes to Mort its to offer him a job as his apprentice. Soon Mort is handling the collection of souls, and Death takes a much-needed break....The problem is, when the time came for Sto Lat's Princess Keli to be assassinated, Mort found himself altering reality by saving her from the assassin. Now reality is trying to reassert itself, Mort is in over his head, and Death is nowhere to be found......
B00AREIAI8|5.0|if you love horses then you'll love this game!! its fun to take care if one and try to win competitions! I wish you could have more energy to play more at one time. but other than that it runs very smoothly on my (almost full) kindle fire. :-)
B0071BGOJC|5.0|I thouroghly enjoyed this book, couldn't put it down.<br />Excellent plot involving the prevoius characters that we learnt to love through the trilogy.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|The responsiveness you get with Intel is awesome. I can say that first hand as I have built AMD machines and there is noticeable difference. If you are just doing the daily grind of watching videos, internet browsing, checking email, using office applications this is all you will need. You need to move up to i5 or i7 if you are into gaming or photo and video editing.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|We just started watching season 5 this weekend, thanks for the entertainment.  glad we ordered it for our long wintery nights.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft but I can't get updates very fast on my kindle fire. I would really like it if I could get minecraft updates very soon like the IPad and IPhone and I would love minecraft!! I still like it though
B007W7P5L8|5.0|I first chose this cover because of the color - but it turned out to be a great purchase for other reasons.<br />My last cover had straps that held the Kindle in place and  i really wanted that again.  this one has snaps so i was a skeptical as to whether i would like it.  but i love it.  it holds the kindle securely and there are no straps to move when you need to close a window!  the elastic band on the outside to keep the cover closed is very convenient also.  the cover is sturdy (i have dropped my kindle several times) and it protected it beautifully.  i am very glad i chose this case cover
1616550414|4.0|As someone who has fallen out of love with Nintendo since the Wii-era, it was nice to get a book reminding me of all the great times I've had with this franchise. Like many gamers who cut their teeth on the original gold cart, I have spent many hours in Hyrule. Historia celebrates the richness of one of gaming's major pillars. The art, chronology and insight to the world of Zelda is of immense quality - for $20, this book is a steal. For fans of Zelda, this is a must buy.<br /><br />Why 4/5 stars? Unfortunately, the whole first quarter of the book is devoted to Skyward Sword. Whatever one thinks of that game, it certainly doesn't deserve that kind of attention at the expense of older games in the series. The book would have been better off with a more even distribution of coverage. If emphasis was to be made, LoZ, LttP, OoT and WW would have been better choices to take in depth looks at.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I found this game and downloaded it. I'm still learning but it seems to be a lot of fun. Can't wait to play some more.<br /><br />  Michelle
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love period series and nobody does them as well as the combination team of the BBC/PBS.  The writing is fantastic, the costumes are beautiful and historically correct, the acting is flawless.  What more could you possibly want?
0525425764|5.0|My 11yr old loves these books and always looks forward to the next one. I love that it gives her something to think about, as well as entertains her.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This was a funny movie for most ages.  Appropriately marked as PG-13.  For all others it was great.  I'm still walking around humming the music.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I liked this one every bit as much as the first installment. Cool storyline, interesting characters, great detail, and a very fast read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game I play it all the time. So far my favorite level is Rio. It's the best
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I ripped through five of these in about a month, no problem.  Fast to read, easy to get into the character, and hard to put down.
B004PAHZMC|4.0|Holds lego pieces and great for transport/travel . . . not too large but a convenient size. Grandson loved it!
B005NKGEP2|4.0|I liked this spin on the double move... Pretty good balance of detail and action, and the characters were pretty likable too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|a good game for when bored in lectures.  it is entertaining and comical at the same time.  I reccomend it
B005I548B4|3.0|Having read all of his novels, I must say this is not one of my favorites. We know we always find true love, a death and some coincidences, but here the love story is too weak, the death predictable and the coincidence too much. Even though, you can have a nice time and cry a little bit. Isn´t that what we are looking for when we read one of Nicholas Sparks´ novels?
B0081SPK0I|3.0|I got this app for my 5 year old grandson. Seems to be limited on what it can do, it was fun at first. My 12 year old grandson got bored with it quickly.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|Robin's Sloan's writing is effortless and the plot hammers along but half way through reading the book I got the  feeling that something was missing. I was enjoying the story - which is original and unusual - but there was something nagging at me that I couldn't put my finger on. Then I realised.....the characters have absolutely no depth. There's hardly anything about the characters' backgrounds - apart from their job history - and, most noticeably, there is nothing about their feelings. The main character who is a bit of a geek has a relationship with a gorgeous smart girl but there is absolutely NOTHING about how that feels for him. Even when she leaves him mid-way through, he doesn't seem at all upset. Perhaps it was an experiment on Mr Sloan's part to see if he could write a story that could keep you hooked without getting sullied by emotion but - for me - unless you believe in the characters you just give up caring what happens to them. It's a shame because I would like recommend it purely for the interesting technological asides but at the end of the book I only felt empty - like I'd read a book that had just followed a plot outline with no real life of its own. His character Mr Penumbra believes in the power of books, unfortunately Robin Sloan didn't listen to his own character and produced a book that lacked the emotional strength to make it important.
B000022TSY|3.0|this was a copy someone burned and sold.  the quality wasn't very good but it was as good or better than when it was originally released.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I bought this trilogy on sale, love it. Saves space versus 3 DVDs on the shelf. Came with a &#34;behind the scenes&#34; picture book, which frankly I could take or leave, but the value was definitely worth it if you are a fan of the Nolan trilogy.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|This app is awesome. It is a fast paced game but it is so addicting. Get this app. 5 stars for sure.
B009X2CRMK|5.0|Recently I've had a bit of a Kate Morton marathon & this is my most recent read.  I really enjoyed this novel, there are plenty of twists in the tale & although the story switches from 1913, to the 70s & 2005 throughout the book it doesn't make the story difficult to follow. I've enjoyed all of Kate Morton's books & look forward to whatever will come in the future.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Good characters, nice storyline. Couldn't put book down. I would recommend this book to others. I plan on reading more by this author.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Sucks you in from episode one.  Gather your friends, your gonna want to share this with them.  Great show and packed with action.
B00AYQNOU8|5.0|A wonderland of visual treats this beautiful panorama of the human condition will make you stand up and take notice while you are sitting back mesmerized by the spectacle.
B0002CHIJW|5.0|When  iwas looking to purchase this I heard about the Millennium edition having things the other versions did not have, as far as I can tell it was the same movie with nothing new or added but, still a classic.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is fun it is so much better then the other one and you get more speed and it is easy
B0041KKYCY|5.0|A well done remake of the original. Kept the flavor of the original movie without diluting the plot. If rape makes you squuimish don't watch this:)
B007ZLKK9I|5.0|Nothing I can say that isn't obvious to any fan. George was an amazing musician and an extraordinary man. That combination is painfully rare in entertainment these days.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Fun! Cool new angry birds with light sabers! I couldn't stop playing and can't wait for even more levels to play!
B00B7G3NFU|3.0|Movie kept me entertained. I think the cast made it.  Otherwise I may have found myself being somewhat bored. Therefore I only gave it 3 out of 5.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are almost impossible to put down once you pick them up! None stop action and great back story. Also makes you think about the world around you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely Love subway surfers and I am trying to get zoe! She is 12000 I  believe but I only have 32471 coins.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I thought the book was very engrossing and engaging. He gives you more than just the raid on Osama Bin Laden, but the history of Navy SEALs and how crucial they are in stealth operations. The book is fairly easy to read, the names of the men on his team, and the names of other officials and terrorists were a liitle difficult to follow because there were so many to follow, but it didn't appease me from finishing the book. His description of the raid is very thrilling, and seems very accurate. If you want an informative read then I highly recommend this book, or if you are looking for something engaging then this book is for you.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This is the number one favorit Christmas movie. I watch it every year. Best picture of all time. Can't get enough of it.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|I saw the movie first, and I loved it, then I downloaded the book and loved it even more. The story and setting is so enthralling and engaging that once you begin you won't be able to put the book down. Lehane sets you up so well, and the reveal at the end is absolutely amazing. If you want a thrilling and engaging read, then you should read this book, you will not be disappointed.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|game is ok, don't give you any directions as to what to do and how to play and it gets hung up just like the pogo poppit games does and it won't let me unlock it and wish I could delete it from my kindle
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What a truly brilliant start to an excellent trilogy! From the moment I started reading the first pages I was hooked and fully engaged in the story and characters. It didn't let me go, and I finished the book in a matter of days while on vacation. I found the story incredibly enjoyable and fascinating. I would recommend reading the book first before seeing the movie, I throughly enjoyed the movie but it lacked in character development compared to the book. If you are looking for an engaging read, or you just want to read something different, then I suggest reading this book, because you will not be disappointed.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Color Note is one of the most used apps I have. It is Great for organize the different groups of info I need to find quickly.
B003FSTN7A|5.0|Like all the Medium series the sixth season was great!  Can't wait to watch my seventh season now. One of the best series ever on TV...and the &#34;Ghost and Mrs Nuir Ending was tops!
B00A4GXJD0|5.0|I have a very diverse variety of music that I listen to. Kid Rock has a very distinct style, that I can relate to. His style isn't for everyone but I enjoy it when I am in a certain mood. I reccommend people give it a listen and decide if it is for you. I have purchased a couple of  his albums and enjoy them. Happy listening.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is really fun and entertaining iam a person that always tell the truth. this was fun and this is comming from a 13 year old
B000XKZQ74|5.0|This wonderful story of human compassion.It shows that we, as human beings will in the end do the right thing.

B00AQ71FLK|4.0|Very in-depth dungeon crawl type game with nice game play & console game looks for the digital adventurer. Try it out.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is always a great app. I have it for my phone as well and manage to always get ideas and or producs I can use.
B007ZTLLMK|3.0|Helicopter flight simulation is a fun concept.  However, this particular game might be frustrating for some.  For me, it requires a great deal of patience (and a strong stomach).<br /><br />One has the option of controlling the \\"radio controlled\\" model helicopter with either Gyro Control or Joystick Control.  When I flew with the Gyro Control, I succeeded in nothing more than making myself very dizzy and motion sick.  The Joystick Control is a bit more forgiving. Even so, the Joy Stick control requires finesse.  Regardless of which type of control you choose,  both are extremely sensitive. I guess if you already own an RC model helicopter, then you have a big advantage in this game. There is a nice tutorial available to get everyone off to a good start.<br /><br />On the Kindle Fire HD, this App takes up about 18.3 MB of space.<br /><br />Of note is that as one explores this App, one will find that users are encouraged to install \\"Heyzap,\\" an App available from the Google market. Heyzap is not available from Amazon. I'm mystified as to how it is that Heyzap is even allowed to be mentioned on the Amazon version of Helidroid.  Kindle Fire users seeking to unlock all the Helidroid extras available through Heyzap will be somewhat disappointed that this App is not accessible to them.<br /><br />The 3D graphics are pretty good; they certainly are realistic enough to make one motion sick.<br /><br />So far, I have been able to complete the first two missions.  I'm afraid I am getting frustrated, so I might play a bit more and then \\"put it on the shelf\\" for a while.
1416955070|3.0|read a few books of this series an awfully long time ago and figured it was about time for a reread, particularly with all of the movie buzz going on. While I'm not sure I liked it as much this time around, it was still an enjoyable novel.<br /><br />It really lagged in the middle for me. The beginning was quick because I liked the world building and learning about the characters. They soon became like cookie cutter images that were too predictable and too flawless. Even when bad things happened it never seemed to be one person's fault or because of a certain bad trait. I know that Jace was supposed to be the love interest but he seemed too antagonistic in a forced way for me to really like him. (Of course, I remember that my opinions about him changed as I read the series, but this is just my impression from City of Bones).<br /><br />The middle . . .  It seemed like nothing was happening. Except they would tell Clary not to do something, she'd do it anyway, and chaos would come about. The end really gripped me and made me want to pick up the second book immediately; it recaptured my interest and reminded me of why I found this series so captivating. I really think that although this isn't the perfect series for me, it's still a good read and I know that countless amounts of people will really like it. Particularly because they're going to make a movie out of it and get it more exposure.<br /><br />City of Bones is a book that I really fought to love. It took me a long time to get through; in the middle I set it aside and had no inclination to snatch it back up again. But by persevering and allowing it to capture my interest, I realized that this is still a very good read.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|My 7 year old daughter and I watched this movie together. She loved it so much that we watched it the next day again with her Dad. We ended buying it the following day on Blu-Ray/DVD and watched it again! It is a very funny movie and has adult humor thrown in to keep the adults into the movie. I highly recommend seeing it.
0439023491|5.0|I know I'm entirely behind on this series, as it seems everyone and their mother has already finished the third and final book, Mockingjay. And I'm hoping desperately that no one will accidentally ruin it for me. Anyway, everyone that knows me has realized that I'm a horrific procrastinator, even if there's no real reason to procrastinate.<br /><br />Back to the book review. Catching Fire is so intense! Because Katniss's world was so thoroughly explained in book one, there was little to be added and extra details could be skipped over so the reader is taken right into the plot. Though I sort of already had an idea as to how the book would turn out, it was nothing compared to actually reading it. I love Katniss, Peeta, and the rest of the crew, and now cannot wait to read Mockingjay.<br /><br />I love this writing style, which picks up during the action and slows to become more descriptive in other parts. I like how the inevitable gory details aren't skimmed over, but the Games are represented just as horribly as they should be.<br /><br />Catching Fire gets 5/5 stars. I highly recommend it, but don't reach for it if you don't like to read about death. Let the Games begin.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|More greatness from the creators of Quell.  This has kept my husband entertained at bedtime for weeks now.  I'm looking forward to the next edition, whenever that comes out!
B008HT4FUW|4.0|Bought it for my Wife as a gift and she loved it. It had all the videos she was looking for and watched more than once. Thanks.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|Extremely enjoyable.  Pity they only did the two seasons.  I had seen season one and when I saw the final season advertised had to have it
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This is a great, feel good type of movie.  Fat Amy was hilarious!!  Cant wait to watch it again!  They \\"crushed it\\"!!
B0077ATSSQ|4.0|I took a while to warm up to this film.  But it was and enjoyable film with a surprise ending.  Well worth the watch

B000M341RI|5.0|Normally not too big a fan of slapstick...but this movie is hilarious. Would suggest it to anyone who might need a good laugh.
B0060D2QR6|5.0|This movie was amazing. It shows young love like no other movie. It's inspiring and lovely. I most definitely recommend it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am so grateful for whomever made this app. It was such a pain trying to use pinterest on the web. This app make it so easy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! It's so fun and addicting!<br />Every time I play it I can't stop.<br />I like beating people's high scores
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My kids and cousins son can't get enough of this one. Especially Mr. Cuddles, the dragon. They run my battery out all the time playing this one!

B008MEM24S|4.0|this one my husband bought, thanks for making it a reasonable price. He liked it. It was fun and we like those brainy games.
B008HK3XYK|4.0|It already doesn't stand up (like in the picture) as well as it did at first.  It works and looks great, though.
0071766588|5.0|I def would recommend this book. I took a Toefl preparation class and I have to say that I found this book better than the class. There are some keys about how the test works, what they expects you to answer, etc. I love it!
B00AREIAI8|2.0|This game tries to guilt you into caring, and thus sucks your soul. Do not get sucked in! Really, Don't!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My grandson introduced me to this game.  It is very addictive.  I keep picking up my kindle to play this game.  Try it, you'll like it.
B00005JKDR|1.0|It does not even play, its all scratched to crap and the second disc has a crack in it. I already gave a review on it and that was never replied back to.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I honestly love this game I can't put it down its very addictive and everybody plays it all the time now unless you've been living under a rock you should know by now how awesome subway surfers is
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|Bought this for a white elephant gift. The kids loved playing with the game. I want one for myself now!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The story started off good on page one. The reader knew secrets would eventually surface when it sort of plateaus for a couple of chapters. The author revealed everything at the perfect pace before the end that you don't see women. Great twist of love and tragedy. Would recommend for older teen or young adult. Very creative!
0802130208|4.0|I enjoyed reading the book. I saw a story about John Kennedy Toole on TV and it made me curious. So I ordered the book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love how you jump from train to train. I also love the unlimited lives but I think the deadlines for the daily challenges should be extended. this game is lollipop addictive. p.s. I really love lollipops
B00005JPUN|4.0|Item was shipped and arrived in just a cuople of days. The movie dvd  arrived way ahead of promised schedule.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is a remarkable achievement, probably the finest Earth document yet!  I enjoy hearing the voice of David Attenborough,  the rich music, and above all, the magical camera work!
B0034G4P94|5.0|I have watched this movie several times in the last couple months and have shared it with my closest friends and family. It meets all my requirements for an outstanding movie: great acting, powerful themes, artistically produced, free of vulgar/unnecessary content, and a story swells your heart long after the credits role.<br /><br />I think this movie got overshadowed by the Fighter...maybe people thought &#34;oh just another movie about two brothers that fight..must be mimicking the Fighter.&#34; This is a completely different film, and in my opinion far superior. It is now my favorite movie of all time.
B005QI4TP8|2.0|Briefly, I love Florence + The Machine, as well as the songs on this album.  However, when played on CD, the dynamics are so harsh I had to turn down the volume to the point that  listening to this CD was getting to be fatiguing and unpleasant.  This is a rare case where the ripped audio played through an iPod may actually improve the quality of the album.  Which is sad, because the arrangements on the surface sound so beautiful that if the album was less compressed, I would spend hours listening to the album and Florence's awesome vocals.  Buy either a MP3 copy or find a copy with less dynamic range compression.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Excelente producto, llego sin ningún contratiempo y en perfectas condiciones, recomendado 100% a todos. . . . . . .
B000KKPN5C|4.0|As I recently bought a D5100, I wanted a better flash than the stock pop-up that came with the camera, since the flash could be pretty harsh.  After reading about this on Ken Rockwell's site, I decided to dive in.  I am not a camera enthusiast by any stretch of the imagination.  I also did not want to lug the SB-600 around everywhere.<br /><br />This flash is actually pretty small (fits in the palm of my hand), with a nice carrying case.  Mounting is easy.  The main feature that I loved about it was the pop-out flash that will bounce up to 90 degrees, which gives a much warmer feel to pics than the direct flash.  My only gripe is the amount of time you have to wait if you accidentally shoot 2-3 frames at a time when bouncing (usually 15-30 seconds, but can feel like minutes when you are in a hurry to get a shot).  Otherwise, I have no regrets buying the flash.  A must for those who don't want to lug the bigger SB-600 everywhere.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Excelente producto, llego sin ningún contratiempo y en perfectas condiciones, recomendado 100% a todos. . . . . . .
B00008BXJG|5.0|My rating is about the music itself, I think it's one of AC/DC's best albums and I was already familiar with it. However the purchased cd wouldn't play in my MacPro cd/dvd drive - it would load but get ejected shortly thereafter. After a thorough check, also with other cds in my possession, it turned out not to be an issue with my laptop and cd-dvd drive, so I returned the cd.
0345803485|5.0|This book is a must read!! It really does meet all your expectations. Once you read this you want to finish the trilogy.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|I would recommend the movie for children between the ages of 5 - 10 but for an adult watching with the child it was a bit boring. It had a happy ending. None of it believable but cute and fairly well animated.  The movie is produced by Adam Sandler, also the voice of Dracula. It was fast moving, had many funny moments and was heart-warming, to use a few cliches. Final call, rent, don't purchase.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I love the fact thAt you really need to use your brain with this game!! It had a little bit of everything, hidden objects puzzles and mystery!!
B00340LM8C|4.0|Grace Kelly and her outfits are worth the viewing.  All else is gravy.<br />A tanned and much older Cary Grant is a bit tight - reformed thief on the run from cops does not play well into this strengths.<br />Nice Cote-d-Azur backdrop.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It was a good story line...somewhat. definitely need to read the others! That was such a cliffhanger...cliffhanger from you know where
B00B0LPYXG|1.0|We walked out on a Denzel Washington movie!  Never would have saw that coming but the movie starts with a ridiculous graphic nudity scene, one-sided of course, of a woman walking around the hotel room naked while Denzel is covered under the sheets on the phone.  Not just a quick shot, but extended with her beaver and boobs in your face and then she has to put on her thong panties.  Then she gets on top of him and straddles him, close up of boobs...it amounts to porn. It was an insult to the movie-going experience and we walked out and got our money back. It had no place at all in the movie.  You know who usually decides what movie to see in the theater?  The female in a couple.  So why aim movies at teen boys when if they want to see that stuff it's free all over the internet?  Makes no sense.<br />There might have been even more than that, but we were long gone so I don't know if there was or not.<br />John Goodman in a movie with a scene like that surprised us too.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love the Temple Run 2 app because of the graphics;and the controls.  It's just a so relaxing!!!  I would just love if there was a Temple Run 3. That would be the best!!!  BYE!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works and I actually like that it runs in the background and updates weather here changes one minute to the next causing hazardous driving conditions. I check it often throughout the day.

B007EECSFA|4.0|I enjoyed the story told in this book - it really made me think about what it must have been like to live in London during the Blitz, how it changed the way people viewed the world and how it changed thought patterns-especially when it came to right and wrong. Things became much more gray than black and white. Bringing this forward to our current day, we all might learn some lessons of how people react when under this type of stress.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you are looking for a game that makes you want to play it all the time then get this game. You won't regret it
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a good game. Play it. I hate doing reviews. I just wanted to rate it not write something.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I was not sure this was a movie I would watch, but I did.  I could not get this movie out of my head when it had finish.  How true it was I do not know, but this man did exist.  I googled him.  Great movie with sensitivity.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Okay for all of you who had already experienced the fast-paced thrill ride of one of Mr. Rollins' books, this review is not for you as you already know how great they are. I got this book either free or as a special offer for my kindle and wow, it was the greatest purchase ever. I have gone on to buy two more of his books and really look forward to reading any and everything this guy has written! The blend of history and science with spy scoops, special ops and military might, along with most excellent bad guys and stunning heroes/heroines was just what the mind doctors ordered to get me through the rest of the winter doldrums! If you need an excellent escape and don't mind staying up entirely too late reading, Mr. Rollins' books are your answer and this one is FABULOUS! Be afraid, be very afraid of a late night page turner! Kudos!
B000FC13UE|5.0|I always love Neil Gaiman and can read or listen his stories (even ones meant for children) over and over. This collection is a bit darker than some of his other short stories. I was drawn into each tale - sometimes to a very uncomfortable place. Wonderful.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Five and a half star book truly stunning definitely Rick's best book yet. Can't wait till the fall. I also love how he mentioned a mythbusters episode
B008220BLG|4.0|For fans of zombie movies, the first thing you need to know about WARM BODIES is that it is rated PG-13.  This is very much not a movie about the gore, or brain eating or limb rending.  It's a gently amusing love story, which instead of featuring a couple that is mis-matched because one is rich and the other poor, or one is old and the other young, or one is a Capulet and the other a Montague, in this case one is a zombie and the other is still alive.<br /><br />WARM BODIES is a zombie movie for people who aren't necessarily big zombie movie fans or for big zombie movies fans who don't mind a zombie-mythology that isn't well explored (or even makes a lot of sense).  If you're a hard core fan who spends a lot of time parsing out the differences between Romero's zombies as opposed to the zombies in THE DEAD...or if you thought ZOMBIELAND made a mockery of your beloved genre...then stay away.  Otherwise, prepare for a  low-key, charming treat.<br /><br />We're introduced to our central character, a zombie named \\"R\\" as he shuffles around an airport full of fellow zombies and we get to hear his internal narrative.  He's our guide through all of this...so at no point is \\"R\\" a mindless, soul-less...well, zombie.  He's more like a human who is trapped inside the body of a zombie.  He doesn't really like to have to eat other people...but he does get a bit of a guilty charge out of eating brains, because he also eats their memories and feelings.  \\"R\\" was also a young man when he was changed...so when he bumps into an attractive, but living, girl named Julie...his romantic interest in her is far stronger than his desire to consume her.<br /><br />He leads her to his \\"lair\\" inside an old commercial airliner and insists she stay there for awhile, so he can keep her safe.  She complies, and the two forge an unusual but nicely touching friendship.  They little details of their courtship are quite fun, and in general, the best scenes in the film feature just these two together.  Relative unknown Teresa Palmer (SORCEROR'S APPRENTICE) is charming without being too sweet, and best of all is Nicholas  Hoult as \\"R.\\"  Hoult first appeared on the scene as the dreadfully awkward kid in ABOUT A BOY (an overlooked classic, if you haven't seen it) but seems to have managed to escape the \\"child actor\\" blues and is forging a nice career for himself in young adult roles.  He's unconventional looking, and this helps his performance.  His \\"R\\" is soulful but also always looks slightly startled...as though he's expecting to be shot at any moment or is still stunned to find he is a zombie.  The chemistry these two share is terrific.<br /><br />The film is essentially their relationship...but because it's a medium budget film, it's also about trying to convince the \\"powers that be\\" on both sides that zombie/human love is okay.  In fact, the film is about how \\"the power of love\\" can overcome some pretty huge obstacles...not exactly a new message, but you've NEVER seen it play out in this scenario.  Major points for originality.<br /><br />I won't get into much more of the plot, except to say the film is at its weakest when attempting actions scenes.  They include some mediocre CGI and some undramatic confrontations between humans and zombies.  This is the only spot where the PG-13 rating hurts...the zombies never seem to do any serious damage.  The film simply doesn't generate much suspense in the more action oriented scenes.<br /><br />The supporting characters are quite minor, but standouts include Rob Corddry as R's best friend and quirky Analeigh Tipton as Julie's BFF.  Tipton, in particular, gets to have some fun late in the film.  However, the film also commits the sin of wasting John Malkovich.  Next to Christopher Walken, is there an actor alive who gives better crazy, zany, weird, wacky, etc.?  Well, Malkovich is asked to play things straight as the military leader of the humans...and in the end, all I did was hanker to see the upcoming sequel to RED, where he will no doubt steal the show once again.<br /><br />WARM BODIES is a gentle movie.  It doesn't have the over-the-top laughs of ZOMBIELAND.  It doesn't concern itself with homage as did SHAUN OF THE DEAD.  It simply takes zombies and explores what would happen if zombie weren't completely given over to mindless eating.  Few gut-busting moments...but many wry observations and sweet moments.  A date move for zombie lovers.  What could be wrong with that?
B003F3PMYI|5.0|I almost think it's a must read for everyone.  Easy and light reading, but very effective.  I've learned some great lessions from this book.  I actually believe I'm happier because of this book. And more productive at work.

B005LAIHCM|5.0|Going in I wasn't expecting a film this good.<br />The director spends most of the film leading you down one path, then bang comes the surprise.<br />Jennifer Lawrence is as good as she was in Hunger Games.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book is definitely a page turner and I loved it beginning to end.  Katie is so likable and her story keeps you wanting more.  The ending was a nice unexpected twist.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|This show was so good, I miss it now that I've watched the first season.  The characters have real personalities, the story line is interesting, and the tension that builds up in each episode is unbelievable.

B000UX6THK|5.0|I purchased this last year.  Only just viewing it now as I have a great number of DVDs I purchased through 2012.  This is an incredible series.  Different to any others that would like to think they are great viewing.  It is quirky, it is different.  A well developed script, fantastic acting by all involved.  I am presently up to disc 7, still watching, still enjoying.  If you like to watch a series that holds your interest, this is it.  I would like to add to this review that not only is the viewing production great but the music and songs are, the best I can decribed them as eerie but brillant.  Even the main lead tune that comes up at the beginning of every episode I have not grown tied of hearing.  I am up the end of disc 7 now so I do now know who killed Laura Palmer, but it has swung to other areas of investigation which includes drugs.  I am waiting to see that the characters in this series, who only a mother would love, get their come-up-ens.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed the book and some of the twists and turns, and about halfway through, I got hooked.  At times i thought it stayed in certain places a bit too long.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Well done.  Loved all the segments.  I knew something bad would happen, but just when you think you have it figured out....something else comes.  The last episode was so saaaaaad!  Can't wait for the next season!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoyed it fully. It is a great show that has me glued to my seat on a regular basis
B007PAAO0Y|5.0|Bobby Womack is my favorite artist.  When I heard he was sick, I immediate purchase this product because this is latest release.
B00004T0US|4.0|It wasn't up to Elvis' usual standards.  Of course he wasn't exactly in great health at this point.  It just lacked the energy of previous albums.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a while.  Good twists and turns. I would read more from this author.
B002BX4VEK|5.0|Elvis was in excellent health and voice at this point in his career.  It was a great mix of rock-n-roll, pop, rhythm and blues as well as country.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|My wife wanted this dvd for a long time and it  finally went down in price enough to buy it.
B007DJUO8O|1.0|absolutely the worst sounds recorded in modern history. I like all kinds of music and am very tolerant of any artist - however the sounds that came from this cd were dreadful. I love PT and and a fan of smiths music - sorry a clear miss for me
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|not worth the watch at all.<br />do not waste your time on this.<br />too profane for a small teddy bear

0670023329|5.0|This is a great story of one man's courage and determination to live in a world free of the tyranny of North Korea.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app. The great variety of ambient audio files as well as the subliminals  are definitely worth the small investment in purchasing the full version.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Worked great. Fits my kindle fire as described. Meets all my expectations and functions that it is supposed to perform.

B001NLKT60|5.0|I found this book to be a real page turner.  The plot is filled with twists and turns and the characters are well developed.  I couldn'[t wait to purchase the third book in the trilogy.

B003SHYVO8|4.0|MY good friend is a huge fan of the &#34;Step Up&#34; movies and this is one of her favorites. The dancing is great and it has a pretty good story line.
B006MW3V6U|1.0|Love downton abbey and was excited to be able to catch up with season two. Unfortunately the buffering was so bad that I gave up trying to watch it after only 5 minutes.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Has a nice energy. Nice and bluesy, with a little reggae. It's nice to hear something in the mainstream industry that's not autotune and Ke$sha-ey.
B0081KZ20E|4.0|World War II stories are interesting and the jackal made for a very interesting character. The invasion planning as the plot was particularly interesting.
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|The controls are great...they give you a warning for the tilt controls saying that they are extremely sensitive to remind you throughout the game. Even the virtual joystick works better than expected. I would highly recommend this game even though I am no a big SIM person.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I have been following agent Pendergast since the very first book. I believe this is a fitting ending to this trilogy. There are certainly enough plot lines to keep this series going for many books to come.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love these books. They read so easily and in detail. I feel like I become apart of the book and that's why this is my second time reading them.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the story lines, costuming and scenic shots. This show is entertaining and fun to watch! Highly recommend to anyone!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun and addictive. I can't seem to stop playing but that's a good thing lol I'm always trying to beat my score
B00B2V66VS|1.0|It keeps freezing up.  You have to go out and then come back to play.  Very annoying.  Every time so far.
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|Came in great time. Products are awesome. I have no complaints. I have already watch ahs and walking dead. Dont hesitate to buy
B007VUA7VO|4.0|A good app to monitor the state of your battery life, offering comparisons for how different functions consume energy. Great for being free.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Perfect game to play while flying.  Helps the time go by a lot faster when you don't have an in flight movie and have finished reading sky mall ;)
B008XBCJ34|5.0|probably the most awsome 3D movie ever. Had to try my LG 3D tv out. Works just fine, would recomend it to anyone
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Honestly, if I had to rate it on the first 50%, it probably would have been 2 stars. The first approximately 50% of the book was - Gideon is so hot. I love you. I love you, too. Let's have sex. Repeat multiple times. The book picked up around the 50% mark (or maybe a little further in). From that point on it was better, and I would have given it 4 stars for that section. So, to make things fair, I compromised with 3 stars.<br /><br />In the last half of the book there was an actual story line with a plot and everything, including an ex-boyfriend. That right there was probably the best part of the whole book. I would have loved to see that storyline taken deeper - perhaps in the next book. Overall, the book was good if not predictable. Three stars for I liked it, I just wish it would have been better.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Good quality. Good update time. Facebook is a lot easier to use on my kindle than my iphone. It's pretty convenient.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Good story but seems to written for younger audience. Would have liked more detailed storytelling and depth to characters and plot.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|A friend had me download this for a trip I was taking and I don't get it at all. Seems way too complicated.
B001NLL93W|3.0|The premise of the mortal instruments series is great, especially if you are into the occult or wars between heaven and hell.  However, there are aspects of the love story that I find to be convoluted and distracting.  There are times where I scanned and skipped whole sections because I found the love affair between the main characters to be on the brink of nauseating.  If you can get past the whiny, teen angst of the Protagonists confused little girl mentality, the rest of the book is really great.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Thank you to my son for turning me on to this show!  It is just edge of your seat AWESOMENESS!!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Soooooo Good! I can not wait for the rest of the series!  This entire series is so good.  It has been a long time since I found myself trapped in a book series and not wanting out.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|Excellent!!!! A really absolutely fantastic movie with great actors and the music....oh man the music was sooooo totally worth watching the whole movie, plus the story line was totally great, as well!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this app is so cool!!! it is tons better than the first one.  this is one of my favorite games to play
B0011UBDTK|5.0|This is an excellent show collection, absolutely no problems or complaints and would recommend this to anyone open to great stuff telling it like it is!! This is a really cool collection.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Best movie I have seen in a long time. It really delivers a solid movie offering. I was so impressed because I thought it was going to just be an action movie, but it was much, much more. Great story, great plot, great action, great movie!!
0670023329|4.0|Bad is never good until worse happens. Reading chapter after chapter I'm thinking life isn't fair and this is really unhumain until I got to the next chapter. Even after escaping Camp 24 and not knowing which way to go that when he came to his real journey. Today his destination is not clear but he learning that he has power and he will his way to another new beginning.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|The game itself is entertaining. So entertaining that since i had a gift card I decided to purchase some coins when I ran out so I can play longer. Granted it was only less than $5, the amount was deducted but I never received the credits. I emailed customer service and got a response back immediately asking for more information (i.e. device name, model number, etc). I answered but havent received a response back. We'll see. Would love to continue to play the game but that experience kinda ruins it for me. Learned my lesson, don't use real money! Even if you have a gift card to use. :(
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm not a TV wacher, definitely not a soap opera fan. As my wife watched Sea1 Ep1, I was exposed to &#34;second hand television&#34; while looking over the top of a magazine. I was hooked in 15 minutes. I bought the first 2 seasons and a TV Pass for the 3rd. One or two episodes daily have got me up to date.<br />Production values all off the chart good. Writing is excellent. There are no flat characters; are all dynamic, growing every episode. And every so often you get a glimpse into someone's soul. I know these people as well as my own family.<br />On the downside, the British accent can be hard to understand. I sometimes have to back up a few seconds and listen again. Closed Caption doesn't work on these Amazon digital downloads with my DVR.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|This fast past ending to the fae series was the best one yet. Karen Moning always leaves you wanting more.
0735619670|3.0|This was an OK book, but we had to buy it for class. I don't think I will use it much in the future however.
B0078JRFZE|2.0|this series at its best is not as good as everyone makes it out to be...\\"oh no the pudding isnt ready\\"...but all the characters are different in season two and you dont really know why...when all these things happen to Bates, for example, i feel like Anna is a fool, not a woman in love...Bates cant be forgiven over and over again, he just seems like a loser.  why is she so sure that he is such an amazing man when so much goes wrong around him...why did they drop the plot about patrick...you start to feel like, \\"how can no one realize what is going on here...why doesnt anyone say anything when they are supposed to...\\"  its contrived and synthetic...if anyone opened their mouths and told someone else what was going on...this season would be 20 minutes long.  robert and his wife were so devoted and now she is mean and he is upset he has to eat lunch alone...oh no the cake isnt good!!!!  its a disaster.  watch Spooks instead.
0201721481|5.0|Easy to understand textbook. Came in rather shoddy packaging though. Luckily the book made it safely and in time for my classes.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|If you are a fan of the Alien series, this is a must.  With each movie you get the original theatrical version as well as updated director's cuts (with commentaries as well).  The behind the scenes extras are unreal.  With 2 discs worth, you will go from concept to creation and post-release on each film in GREAT detail.  Interviews with cast and crew take you so deep within each movie that you almost feel like you were a part of it.  For guys like me, who are interested in the movie making process, this is just amazing.  You see how they did the special effects and all of their little secrets are shared.  I've had this for a couple of weeks and I'm not even close to being half way done with the features.  5 Stars.  Incredible.
B00932H1HG|5.0|such a good album. Animal Collective is always bringing the heat. It's like they know my innermost thoughts and desires
1451627297|4.0|As is typical when reading King I found myself completely sucked in.  I fell in love with the characters and was completely sucked into the little world he created... once again.<br /><br />I do think the book opened up a couple too many stories and could have been a little better if a few random tangents hat got opened and never solved were just left out, but as a whole it was a great read.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|2 year old loves this movie., she watches it every day., she loves the pig in the movie and all the other animals
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Beautifully written and very heart warming.  A great way to talk about hardship and healing through the eyes of a friend.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Enjoyed this book and this author after seeing him on TV.  Gives lots of comfort and is very thought provoking.
B000V7J82S|5.0|Hearing these greatest hits on remastered vinyl is awesome.  Buy this if you do not already own it.  The sound quality is amazing and the songwriting is even better than that.
0062082353|1.0|A person like Chris Kyle is almost like the Uruk-hai character of Lord of the Rings - a mindless killing machine.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|If you are a huge nerd for Harry Potter and want all the special features, WAIT! Wait for the complete &#34;complete&#34; collection with all the extras to come.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is so addictive and you never want to put it down.This game is so fun and amazing that even little kids love it to.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Need I say more. Although this is not the same as the original Dark Shadows, I believe it pays great homage to Barnabas Collins, and the rest of the characters.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|It is a series that keeps you wondering and guessing and you never know &#34;who-done-it&#34;. The acting is phenomenal!!! I highly recommend &#34;Elementary&#34;.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|This movie has been watched many times already and I have introduced it to many others. I would recommend this to lovers of the Princess Bride.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is really fun. I love it. It has great graphics and it's very entertaining. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone reading this right now.
031618201X|5.0|I have read the original books and REM did an amazing job condensing that first book down to this manga.
B007SGM084|5.0|A person who doesn't normally read, has been obsessed over reading this trilogy! I recommend this trilogy to males and females at least 25 years old. I fell in love with this story, now I feel sadness that it's over!
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT ON DVD MY GRANDSONS WATCHS IT 4 TO 5 TIMES A DAY IT'S A COOL MOVIE I RATED THIS A 10+
B00APUQT7I|2.0|The fundamental premises of this series I find to be wrong, however, from an entertainment perspective, it seems that the quality of the first movie has continued to be missed in each successive movie produced afterwards.  I don't think this is as good as the previous, which wasn't as good as it's previous movie.  I'd look elsewhere as the value is very wanting in this series.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|Once again Grisham weaves a story that is believeable, interesting and suspenseful.<br /><br />Grishams books woven around legal matters show a considerable depth of knowledge /research and never fail to please
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is one of my wife's favorite holiday season movies.  It's clean and well produced! The family values are good (charity and not being selfish).
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Not since 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind,' has there been a movie of this magnitude. This film combines pathos, humor, satire, action, and love into a very throughly entertaining cinematographic experience. All the characters were played to the very best by the actors.  This film is in a genre all to itself and should be a part of any DVD collection.  SOMETIMES FAITH AND SUPPORT IS ALL THAT IS NEEDED IN LIFE'S STRUGGLES!  NJMJr.
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|This is a fantastic classic family movie.  Totally clean, has some good solid action, and some good family values about loyalty.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|This picture is a study of the darker side of human nature.  It is a story of death in all of its Gothic nature.  The story line actually originated in Europe around the middle to late 19th Century, and has been perpetuated by the film industry(motion pictures).  This film follows the standard Vampire scenario in both setting and characters.  The ending of this picture has a phrase from which I will quote verbatium - \\"FOCUS POINTS:  THE COLLINSES:  EVERY FAMILY HAS ITS DEMONS!\\"  NJMJr.
B00AGH6FD8|4.0|This movie is hilarious and clean.  The acting is just as good as the first one, though some of the stunts are not as believable as the first (there are a few scenes that boarder on the cheesy).
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|This is the third film in this series which is the brain-child of Steven Spielberg.  This time the story line becomes even more personal and private revolving around an alien escape and a possible death of one of the agents.  Time travel is utilized to try and correct this problem.  This installment provides the audience with a more personal and humanistic approach in the relationship between the two agents.  HUMAN NATURE WILL ALWAYS BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF ANY RELATIONSHIP!  NJMJr.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|Just what I was looking for - something to keep my thoughts together; notes for the book I might write, the class I'm giving and just my own lists.<br />So far (just had it a day or two) I'm liking Notebooks and have recommended it to others

1612680402|4.0|Retire Young, Retire rich expands upon Rich Dad, Poor Dad by delivering more detailed information about Robert Kiyosaki's actual plan to become rich. This book is more about how to invest and what to expect from you investments, and what plan to set for yourself and what to expect along your journey. This is not the basic comparison between what makes successful people rich and poor people poor, but focuses only on the wealthy people and particularly those that are young and wealthy and what they had to do to get there. This is mostly told from Kiyosaki's own examples.<br /><br />His wife and himself took 9 YEARS to make $100K/year in passive income (less work so they can retire because they don't have to use physical labor anymore, using OPM a.k.a Other People's Money).‏ This was the time it took them to get to the affluent level, or \\"minor leagues\\". 5 years later they were at the rich level (which seems to be $500,000 net worth). It goes to show you that his definition of rich is comfort-ability--not owning expensive items like cars or boats or personal houses. This was just from real estate, though. Now that he has his own business, he will probably be making a lot more money.<br /><br />A question that must be answered to become rich: HOW CAN I DO WHAT I DO FOR MORE PEOPLE, WITH LESS WORK, AND FOR A BETTER PRICE? (this forces you to get creative, as \\"value\\" is inherit and subjective to people. They are unpredictable on what they will pay money for and what they want or feel like they need.)<br /><br />Losing is part of a winner's game (it is the poor and delusional who think that winning must happen 100% of the time). So, be prepared for failure and rise above it once it happens.<br /><br />Rich people use OPM (other people's money) and OPT (other people's time). Poor people try to use their own $$ to get rich ...rich people borrow<br /><br />Kiosaki's plan with his wife (his master plan): two years after the market crashed and recession set in, he decided to buy two pieces of real estate a year for ten years (it is easier to find more deals as people panic because of the market crash and want to sell at a lower price).<br /><br />The difference between slow/turtle investing and the fast/young rich is: don't quit when the market is good. If you are finding good deals, take out loans to keep them going. The good deals will only be good for so long and are hard to find, so it is worth having good debt in order to purchase an asset that will provide positive appreciation and profit. This is more of a risky strategy, but if the reward is higher than the risk, than it is seen as a good deal.<br /><br />I have yet to use all of the teachings of this book, but it is definitely something that I am interested in. I am grateful for the knowledge and this is a book that I have read repeatedly to get inspired and to condition my mindset for wealth. If you have not read Rich Dad, Poor Dad yet then this book will not make as sense. But, if you have read the first book, then this book is a suitable continuation.<br /><br />-Ken Flemming<br />Author, How to Get a Job in Video Games<br /><br />[...]ten years (it is easier to find more deals as people panic because of the market crash and want to sell at a lower price).

B006AZZPCM|3.0|It's probably one of the best &#34;youtube&#34; apps out there. It looks and ALMOST feels like an official Youtube app. But some of it's function placement is awkward, though luckily everything thus far has worked fine.<br /><br />It looks unpolished, it works well.
1612680011|5.0|This book kicks ass. Not just a little ass, but A LOT of ass! If you want to know how to handle your finances and have it demonstrated in a clear-cut manner in what works and what does not, this is the book for you. I would say that this book doesn't specifically tell you how to build a great business or how to build a successful real estate empire, but it is well-rounded and teaches you the basics of attaining wealth from the perspective of a child who learns from two fathers and his journey through life with both.<br /><br />People that want a secure job with a big company are not ruled by passion, but by FEAR (a big company had to get big because of someone else's passion and risk taking. If you only want to work for big companies, then you are still a cog in the machine of a few conglomerate corporations--that grow bigger because of your submission).<br /><br />Most people become a slave for money and then get angry at their boss, because it's lazy to not look within themselves and change. It's not the boss that is the cause of their money problems, they are the cause of their money problems (if you give an average employee more money, they'll just spend more and still have money problems--this is why you don't pay them more).<br /><br />Fear and ignorance keeps people poor and struggling (trapped). NOT the economy, the government,<br /><br />Schools are used as a platform to teach people a skill, but most people see it as the end, not the beginning (of learning). When you stop learning ignorance sets in and you begin to make decisions based on your emotions alone.<br /><br />THE NUMBER ONE LESSON IN BEING RICH: KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND ONLY BUY ASSETS. Your money should be used to make you more money. This is what happens when you invest in assets that appreciate in value. Your goal should be to have your money working for you, not you working for your money.<br /><br />When financial decisions are made based on emotions rather than logic, you will end up suffering (ex: don't buy a house just because you are in a really happy mood. This could also be stated as: when emotions are high, financial literacy is low. Take the time to think it over and decide whether it is a sound financial decision. It is a decision that will continue to pay off if made correctly, so don't jump into a deal that sounds too good to be true).<br /><br />You should work to learn, not always for money: take a pay cut or a job that's in a separate field from yours, to develop a skill that's weak in you. If you want to lead people effectively (or need self-discipline) join the military, if you are shy take a sales/marketing job or class.<br /><br />There are tons of talented broke people out there (ex: wood carvers in Mexico. Most people can make a burger than McDonald's, but know nothing about business systems. McDonald's is the best at making average hamburgers fast, and providing them to as many people as possible....think about it...the people working there are just pawns in McDonald's bigger game, they have unfulfilled lives and keep complaining, but don't do anything about it because they are unaware and are unwilling to develop their financial literacy).<br /><br />Selling is the most useful trait you can have in life: able to deal with rejection and put your reputation on the line. There are many people who are intellects and have mastered in a certain subject, but are not where they want to be because they can't make their services desirable by others.<br /><br />It seems that most people don't want to make the transition to sales because they think they will lose their soul: but it is that they don't want to change their bad habits (because people are defined by their good AND bad habits).<br /><br />If you want something, first give it. And it will come back in truckloads (like in the book, The Attractor Factor, by Joe Vitale: courtesy, value, donations, etc.).<br /><br />These are just a few of my notes thathave stayed with me, but there are many more points to this book that will hit home even with the most skeptical of readers. If you don't think this information works, just look at or ask any wealthy person what they think about buying assets versus liabilities. It makes a world of difference, and also having multiple streams of income is also important.<br /><br />This book is the real deal because it was recommended to me by a few friends and also, more importantly, a financial analyst for a company that I was working for (100+ people). This is not a get rich slow and save your money from one source of income (your primary job) plan. It is how to have more leverage with your finances and to start getting the results you want.<br /><br />-Ken Flemming<br />Author, How to Get a Job in Video Gameshave stayed with me, but there are many more points to this book that will hit home even with the most skeptical of readers.

0446563048|5.0|This book is written for the entrepreneur inside all of us. It is an underdog story of how a fed up employee started a company selling shoes because he thought that online shoe buying was flawed and needed improvement.<br /><br />The best thing about this book is that it is written more like an autobiography. I had know of \\"Zappos\\" but didn't know their story or that they were growing so quickly and were so successful. This book shows the path of Tony Hsieh and his college roommate who decided to come up with an idea<br /><br />There are hilarious anectodets about the company culture and how the company is very selective bringing in charismatic and friendly employees who are passionate about what they do. An example of this attention to detail is in an instant message technical support conversation that one of the managers of the company had with on of their regular customer support representatives. The manager posed as an extrinsic customer who wanted to be referred to himself in the third person, named Timmy. He would ask for the representative to also refer to himself in the third person and he played along. The representative was professional and also didn't take himself too seriously and was able to have fun on the job while providing the correct information to the customer and closing the sale. The company's dedication to customer satisfaction is not just some mantra that is posted on their wall: it is reflected everyday through the actions of its employees and by its policies, such as a no-questions-asked return policy.<br /><br />Tony speaks of a party that he held in his San Francisco loft that changed his opinion of life. It showed him that he liked giving back and that it wasn't about the money that made him happy, but to provide happiness to others. Participants at the party kept praising him for spending so much money to throw such an awesome party, with laser lights and fog machines included. It was an experience of a lifetime that he was providing them, although he didn't have to.<br /><br />Delivering Happiness demonstrates how powerful a company culture is to an organization. Zappos actual pays people a bonus in order to leave to take a position with another company, if that is what they were planning on doing anyway. They wanted to make sure that the employees are loyal and working because they believe in the company and not just for the money. There is one point where the company moves to Las Vegas to save money since they were expanding. Some of the employees were hesitant with the move, but Zappos tried to make the experience as painless as possible.<br /><br />This book is not just a normal autobiography. It gives specific advise into the mind of a great entrepreneur and real example in how they make daily decisions to make their company great. It even gives you exact emails that he sent his team during unsure situations. Otherwise, the critical information that you want to know and how a great company handles itself.<br /><br />Even Hsieh jokes about his writing handicap, but as someone who is more interested in the information and reality examples, this book is truly a masterpiece.<br /><br />-Ken Flemming<br />Author, How to Get a Job in Video Gamesm, although he didn't have to.<br /><br />Delivering Happiness demonstrates how powerful a company culture is to an organization.

B003ODIZL6|1.0|It's a okay dictionary but u should add more things like non dictionary books like a thesaurus then more things will be there
B006OCM0G0|3.0|Pretty simple casual-core gaming. Your standard &#34;FB game&#34; standalone. On the Kindle Fire HD 8.9, it reacts a bit differently than on a phone. You have to pinch in  to get to the bottom of the store.<br /><br />Similar to SimsFreeplay.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|It is too sensitive for my liking.  I need to know how to get rid of this game from my kindle.
B009YMKL4A|5.0|Amazing film. I've rewatched it many times. Looks fantastic on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9. Just be sure to download the 1080p version for superior video quality.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I can get as mush information from the internet as I can from this  application.  It is an okay app but sometimes hard to navigate.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|The icons look great. It functions like phone mobile version. The only thing is it sometimes..&#34;stutters&#34;. Like the displays what it needs to, then it flickers as if it rendered it again. My only gripe.

B0053TMP24|5.0|I recommend this book to  kids teenagers and even adults. This book is a action packed mystery that keeps you guessing and hoping till the end, this Greek mythology is a perfect cross between fantasy/adventure to mystery.

B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is the coolest.it almost has ever thing Pc has.buy this game and you wont regret it.it has creative survival and crafting
B000SEIK2S|4.0|The book was just getting good when it was rather abruptly over. Scalzi established the characters fairly well, the rules, the universe, etc. and  then ended it, that's why I only gave 4 stars. Other than that, GREAT sci-fi military fiction on par with Heinlein and others, and a unique concept of using older people's experience with new bodies. I probably need to crack open the next book in the series.
B000V63BN6|4.0|I like the CD very much, it arrived on time and as advertised.  I love the<br />Cd and play it often.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is my first Sparks read and I believe I might be hooked! I laughed, cried, and might have chewed my nails a few times. The storyline and characters seemed so real. It was a great love story, not sleazy or cheesey.

B005LAJ1HW|5.0|We have thoroughly enjoyed all three seasons of Boardwalk Empire ~ in particular Season Two!  I can't wait for the next season in the Fall.  Great acting and love the history of the1920's and the prohibition era.

0761169431|2.0|This wasn't quite what I was expecting. Personally, I like origami that can be done and redone with any kind of origami paper. Relying on specific PRINTING on the paper to \\"complete\\" the look of the finished piece, feels like a cop-out. The entire book does just that - and there are only two sheets for each design. So once that's done - you're done. Granted there are a LOT of designs - but something more reusable would have been nice.
B0019UGYK0|5.0|This was a Christmas gift from my kids to their father.  It has always been his favorite movie so I'm sure he loves it.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|Really great read - from the Star Trek spoofing, to the interesting take on time travel, a very funny, well written novel.  One of my best SF reads the past twelve months. I particularly recommend the first of the three codas - just flat out funny.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|You laugh. You cry. You sigh. This gets better and better.The writing is superb. Hurry Season 4 and 5 and.....
B009WO7NQO|4.0|While this has all the characteristics of the original it does change it up. The boards are different and fun. The fact that you can use a light saber in flight is awesome!
B0063IH60K|2.0|I like the solitaire that is on my phone much more. It is easier to play. I hardly ever use this version.
0307387178|2.0|After &#34;Into thin air&#34; by Jon I was tempted to read this book. It is a sad story about a sad and weird man that leaves behind just sadness.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it!  It is absolutely great!  It brings the bible alive and the daily inspiration is nice.  The study plans are also fabulous.  I highly recommend this e - bible to everyone.  Its easy to manipulate and navigate as well!
B00AKO93JK|5.0|This is a great exercise app and it is easy to follow along.  Perfect for traveling.  Have recommended it to siblings and friends.
B007N8RULO|4.0|.<br />The game is wonderful!  I like the graphics and the abiliity to see your best play time.  However, sometimes it does not allow you to make the moves that you desire. It instead makes it own moves.  For example, you may have two Kings showing and want to place your Queen on the first King but the Queen automatically places itself on the second Queen  I would recommend this game to true solitaire lovers.  The challenge is awesome! The game should also be available for the PC
B0010SKUYM|5.0|When I can only find one sentence in a book I don't agree with. I'm personally only partially into fantasy, but this book was originally recommended by Powells books here in Portland, Oregon (one of the best brick and moarter bookstores I have ever been to, btw) for people who like the Game of thrones series, so i decided to give it a chance. It is excellently written, except it really doesn't pass the Bechdel test sadly. Really here is a writer that should take on writing more women characters, because he excels every where else. It's also obvious that the writer has some experience with the music industry reading this, which for me made it more enjoyable. Too bad all your female characters (with one exception) are never developed except in relation to their possible romantic relationship or direct relation to a man, and never as primary characters.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|Love this thing to watch itunes, netflix, hulu etc. at various TV's all over the house. A little pricey for what it is, but it works great.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a great tv show!  The picture and sound quality of the show on the ROKU was great also.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I read King's novels a long time ago but when he want too \\"out there\\" I lost interested. I had to be persuaded by a friend to give this book a chance. It was just a tad slow in the beginning but the more I got into it the more riveting it became. I would definitely recommend this book. It breaks the mold of the usual Mystery and Intrigue I have been reading of late and I was actually sorry that it came to an end. I will re-read it again at a slower pace to really enjoy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I cannot stop playing! This game is just so addicting I find myself just pulling my kindle and playing it whenever. I have a free moment. But I don't like how it glitches sometimes.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun and extremely addictive if you are a temple run fan this is like 2 times better!!;)
0765325950|4.0|I've been a relatively short-time fan of the series (I caught up right around when Crossroads of Twilight came out, I believe) though no less avid for it. I've reread the entire series each time a new book has come out since, and with each book my love for the series, and my anticipation for the ending has only increased. Perhaps my expectations were too high, coming into this last book, but Jordan and Sanderson met most of them admirably. Overall, there were a few loose ends I would have really liked tied up, but the Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills. Knowing that Jordan left as much material as he could, and Sanderson only had those notes and Harriet to work off of, I am content to wait for the encyclopedia to fill in some of the blanks. It has been an anxious wait, but I feel that I am now at peace.
B009RH973I|5.0|This case is exactly what I was looking for. And it's PINK!! Best color ever. Also, I had a 40% off coupon, which made buying it even easier
B00125WAWS|5.0|I first saw this movie in the theater. I think it's a  great movie so I added to my collection, I have actually viewed the DVD yet.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love g5 games and this is no exception. Great story, awesome on the fire.  Even without hd it looks great.  Challenging without being frustrating, definitely worth $3.
B00APJLX8E|4.0|Both my 8 and 11 year old enjoyed this and I did too! Lots of humor and creativity in this film and a good message at the end.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Exciting movie but the story is a little confusing. There seems to be several stories going on a the same time
B003UPPO2G|5.0|Great Dvd a must for Bee Gees fans the extrs wear a great bones and even if you just are a music fan this dvd is for you
0817439390|4.0|Good book, particularly for someone learning to use his DSLR. The author shows ways to create interesting photographs and illustrates his ideas with great pictures. It is the type of book you can read for 10-15 minutes at a time and learn much about how to create good pictures.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|It was a well written and engrossing book, but it was very disappointing in its conclusion.  Euthanasia is never the answer to a problem or problems; there are better ways of dealing with what life throws us.  I hope people don't take this heart-warming story as simply propaganda for euthanasia.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Recently Amazons free app of the day was an app called White Noise. After reading through the reviews and checking to make sure it did not have excessive permissions, I decided to download it. This was the best decision I have made in a really long time. My better half and I have both noticed that we fall asleep quicker, and sleep throughout the night without waking up. We have also noticed that we feel more rested and refreshed in the morning. Also the noise is enough that the dogs don't start barking at every sound they hear. If any of you wake up in the middle of the night a lot, or just don't feel refreshed in the morning, I highly recommend that you try it. Although it is no longer free, it is only 1.99. This will be money well spent.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|Makes an awesome gift or the best addition to a collection. I love all of these movies and this blu ray package was a great addition.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|The music is really good and most of the songs I liked.  It came fast so I had not long to wait to hear it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham does it again. So glad to know that he continues to explore and write new books like this one.. you will not be disappointed.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This was so much fun to watch and see how they developed.  True fans would love this one.....I have been a fan since they started.....
B004WY2M8I|5.0|Always so good to read Anne rice...you never go wrong with one of her books. Such a creative imagination! you won't be disappointed.
B0015G49KK|5.0|What else is there to say??? Classic album of the 70's. You can't go wrong with this in your collection.
B0041O40EI|5.0|This was a lot of fun to put together and extremely informative; especially for an English history buff.  Now interested in the other cities available.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|One of TV's best series. Enjoyable. Good portrayal of life between the Upper class and lower class in early 20th century England.
B003HARV3Y|4.0|Any Percy Jackson fan will love this book.  These have made great gifts to the young people in our lives!
B00130UFY2|3.0|This series keeps getting more exciting. the transition to the legacy was different but good. I forgot how this movie ended so not show how the hollywood style of the book set will play out. Also never compared the two either..
1423140591|5.0|Son-in-law loves these series and has enjoyed this one just as much as all the other books by the same author.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This game is pretty good. It seems to run well. I enjoy playing in the free time. I encourage everyone to try it out.
B001LMAK88|4.0|This is a family favorite!  Probably the best western ever made in recent years.  We really enjoyed it and love Kevin Kline!
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this fun game as a mom and my kids love it too super fun and addicting, love the free download for the kids to play in the car or where ever thanks so much! This is a great free download for your kindle or ipad!!! Love Love
1423113381|4.0|Any Percy Jackson fan will love this book.  These have made great gifts to the young people in our lives!
B00992CF6W|1.0|this app is a waste of money. it is the stupidest /lamest/ dumbest app in the world. never buy minecraft
142311339X|5.0|Gave this book along with Heroes of Olympus Book 2 and our son-in-law really enjoyed both of them.  He has re-read them a number of times.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Novice player - only got it to use it in &#34;killing&#34; time.  Cute stuff makes the time fly whenever awaiting long waits.
B009T3AHDE|2.0|Pattison was really good but the storyline lagged until Zach G entered the pic. You can't expect a single actor to carry a bad script & have a good movie.
B00881PPTO|2.0|Quick download and install on my kindle fire. Tried to check on a couple of overseas flights from California to Japan. It said there were no flights. Tried a couple of domestic flights and several carriers to choose from. For my purposes I cannot use this app. Uninstalled
B007VUCAVO|5.0|What a fantastic little app. It does everything it claims and best of all it does them well. Thoroughly recommended
B007ZTLLMK|4.0|Quick download and install on my kindle fire. You have to be very very patient to fly the missions. While you are timed you can't go fast as all that happens is you crash and see the. &quot;You Failed&quot; box. Then you get to start over.
B005LAII80|2.0|I had the same problem as many reviewers with the 3D disc. I have an OPPO 95, it locked up the player. Solution that worked for me was, before pressing play, go to the scene selection and select scene one and it plays wonderfully. The down side to this movie is that it is boring. The original at least had a story, but this is just shoot em up! Get a Chow Yung fat movie instead!
0515142247|3.0|You've read one, you've read them all... Good read for passing time; easy, predictable but engaging at the same time.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|It was a  good read that kept you guessing for most of the story. Like the writing style of Colleen Hoover.
0440243661|3.0|You've read one, you've read them all... Good read for passing time; easy, predictable but engaging at the same time.
B008BM9L72|3.0|Interesting story. I read it to the end just to find out Christians story. I found the book monotonous, I ended up skipping 6 pages of the sex scene's as they just became boring to read over and over.
B0010AN7Z4|5.0|Jack Lemon and Shirley MacLaine at their best! Young and beautiful. Such great talent Funny comedy, funny, relaxing, a real collectors item!
B005MJFA2W|5.0|This is an incredibly interesting and helpful book if people want to improve they way they choose just about everything in their lives. Far more use than many 'self help' books on achieving ones goals
044024367X|3.0|You've read one, you've read them all... Good read for passing time; easy, predictable but engaging at the same time.
0307596885|5.0|I read several of the stories in the New Yorker, so re-reading them was like finding old friends.  I cannot think of a writer to compare with Munro when it comes to the short story.  She is the best.
B0017XD3OY|3.0|I love this movie but I was dissapointed that you have only the alternate ending version.  I love the original ending and  had to go elsewhere to watch it.  Please have the choices of the different endings when purchasing
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|Yes, it's fun until you hear your 5 year old repeating profanity he heard from the char&aacute;cters. My son didn't realize he was cussing and told me to delete the game from my kindle fire. Parents beware.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|The Polar Express is a great movie! Perhaps too advanced and long for the young preschoolers, but the age 9 and up is great! The color is spectacular! Beautifully told, and the adult crowd would love it as well as the family! Buy this movie for the perfect holiday viewing!!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Good game; sort of like first one, but with new gizmos.  The zip lines are kind of neat to use.
B001E1B6NE|5.0|I liked this movie, however, believe it is for the older viewers. Seems to me to be too advanced for the preschoolers, and would suggest maybe the 9 year olds and up crowd. Very good for the adult viewers as well. Adult humor. Am glad I purchased it.
B002SAUCBC|2.0|Not the norm for a Stephen King novel.  100 kids start walking, and if you stop, you get shot.  Ho hum.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|it is an okay game it is very tricky the bad thing about it is that when you lose all your life's. you start. over
B00B2V66VS|3.0|whenever i got this app it worked great for a few games then it stopped working and i had to uninstall it. it again worked fine and then stoped working:(
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|This book is very informative and helpful in looking at the way schools can work if someone has the insight to do it a different way.
B000NOKA0S|5.0|No complaints this gives a variety of his talent.  The sound is clear - could not be happier with this album
B009T3AE1Y|3.0|One of the stranger movies I've ever seen.  Still, kept my interest the entire time.  Wish I knew how it ended, but even the book leaves you hanging!
0062202081|4.0|Would recommend for justin bieber fun. Our daughter likes The book. Easy to read for 8 y.old. Nice pictures. thanks
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love the way I can play anywhere and how they have different themes and now it's different places this game is something me and my seven year old can play together
B004XWLN20|5.0|Smallville is amazing! the 218 episodes of smallville that a lot. My favorite is superman fan. I like tv show and  a movie. I love smallville collection.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|Every Californian should read at least one Steinbeck novel. This one was very good though it true Steinbeck fashion, he leads you to expect some manner of resolution and it just doesn't happen because that is life. This book will yield to you an emotional attachment to a part of the history of the US and particularly to the plight of the California farmer (as well as others). Read it before or after making a trip from the East to the West coast. I followed this up with The Log from the Sea of Cortez and Steinbeck may now be my favorite author.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|Great cover, no slippage when up right.  Protects my kindle.  Just what I was looking for. Good value for the money.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|This show is one of our top favorites to watch. The witty banter, the great dialogue, and the chemistry between such a great cast, all come together to make this show a hit. The clothing, the power, the city all help as well.<br /><br />Everyone I know wants to be both Harvey & Mike combined.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Fun and pretty adorable too!  Create your own hoard of awesome creatures by breeding any kind you might like to play with!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|good for memory stimulation.  I don't like the jump to reshuffle when you get close to the end though.<br />other than that it's a good game.
B000BVMAJ2|4.0|I bought this for my 2 year old grandson, who really enjoyed the figures as much as the blocks.  As with all Lego products, it is very well made and will last a long time.  A good thing, as the 2 year old has a new baby sister.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am back at work full time but love to catch up on this app it is so addicting .. watch out your whole day will fly by once you get hooked
1423140591|5.0|The books was delivered as advertised.  Thank You for the book.  It was for my daughter and she loved it.
B005HSL626|4.0|It is ok but i dont play it very much  dont have the time to play every game all the time but it seems nice when i play. I have the ads
B0000029J5|5.0|I first heard Keb Mo' at Frederictons Harvest Blues Festival. He was incredible!  I was just walking downtown and stopped to listen - and ended up sitting in the park for 40 minutes.  I promptly ordered this CD and was not disappointed!
B00A3DZ61W|3.0|I like angry birds but when your system has to be rebooted or change from ipad to galaxy i had to go through all the levels again I lost interest.  can't seem to find the time to re do everything... sorry
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It was a good pass-time.  The story was well told, but I didn't get as caught up in it as I did with The Firm.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|This was a good movie. Powerful ending. there some parts where they could've added more detail but I guess they left that for your imagination.
B00574P9EQ|3.0|Not as good as the first one, but loads better than Dog Days, which was just painfully bad, so that's not saying much.
B000068FXR|5.0|If you know and enjoy Supertramp then this is a must! You will not go wrong adding this album to your collection!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Game is so freaking cool. Most of my friends play this game competing who has the higher score. I want to thank the genius who developed this awesome exciting addicting game. YEAH BUDDY!!
B005VQRRYU|5.0|This is an awesome multichannel disc - close your eyes and it's almost experiencing a live experience - This is probably THE very best way to enjoy Oscar Peterson's music today!
1423113454|4.0|My daughter loves Greek Methology so she absolutely loved it. I beleive we have all of the books by Rick RIordan now. If not, we will be purchasing more.
B000069HJI|5.0|If you know and enjoy Supertramp then this is a must! You will not go wrong adding this album to your collection!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Loved it - possibly even better than first season.  Wonderful ensemble cast. You cared about the characters; lots of twists along the way.
B000068FXX|5.0|If you know and enjoy Supertramp then this is a must! You will not go wrong adding this album to your collection!
B0027UY8B8|5.0|The Blu-ray version picture quality is a significant improvement over the original DVD realeases.  I had no problem with this no regional lock Blu-ray set on my North American Blu-ray player.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A fun and exciting read. The author mixes a very bad situation with a great deal of humor. I'll look for more.
630587493X|5.0|Robin WIlliams did a superb job in this flick, looking so young and hairless. Feel good film with humor. I recommend it to all ages.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Was an entertaining read, but nothing too profound. Good to pass the time, but geared more towards an adolescent audience.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|At first I was not going to get the whole cd because only 3 songs on it sounded decent from the samples but I went ahead, it was worth it, some of the other songs sound better listening to the whole thing.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|great CD. great artist, I am really looking forward to more music from Phillip! each song unique and I have listened to many times
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Not as good as the first two books, almost predictable. I started getting bored with the &#34;sameness&#34; of the first two books. It could have had a faster moving pace.  It was still a very good read.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Would read it all the time. If I could but can't. Too bad their was no sequel. Love Mary's personally
B003O86FMW|4.0|A good follow on from the hunger games, all the parts start coming together and we know who is who and what they are doing.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's good and basically like the original version, except there's gems and they're way to hard to find otherwise I'd give five stars
B002MQYOFW|4.0|the first book of a trilogy is always the best; getting to know the characters and separate the good from the bad. A completely different story set in the future, a good teen/ young persons book, although a little gory and blood thirsty.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game for the kindle fire hd. Love I spend a lot of time on this game. I would highly recommend. if you like temple run. I think this one way better and adult friendly.
B004SIP9W4|5.0|Saw this when it first came and enjoyed so decided to get it for my own collection.  Lots of the usual romantic mix-ups.  Stanley Tucci is great fun in the movie.  The ending is the best part.
B007M45PMU|4.0|In addition to being catchy, the album does a pretty good job with flow.<br />And Amazon makes it tough to not own with the price.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Saw this in the theater and enjoyed.  Story has a dark side so may not be for all children to watch. Amination was good.  Alex Baldwin was great fun as a Russian Santa Claus.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is cookbook fun.  I play it all the time!!!!!!!!!!!(:  <3 <3. This way better than temple run!!!!!!  I love this game!!!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think minecraft is the best game ever. I have it on my dads Iphone and ipad.it costs money but its so worth it.on the iphone and ipad its at 6.1.0 alpha. there armour fancy clouds baby livestock stonecutters and even signs nether Colored sheep and more that you'll have to find out by yourself!!!
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|Love this movie & love the special features. Blu-ray quality was excellent. I knew that I loved this movie, but now I understand all of the hard work that went into making it so great! I only wish that this set came with a digital copy of the movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Addictive series. A friend recommended as season 3 was starting. Watched one episode from season 3 and then started from the beginning via Netflix and then Amazon Instant Watch. We're hooked.
B0013D6LEM|5.0|a classic album any Michael Jackson fan should have you can't go wrong for 299 for this purchase.all of Michael Jackson songs are digital remastered and all there this is a must buy album
B00127RAJY|4.0|Id say I'm in okay shape, I run about 5 miles a week and do some p90x. I was looking for some cardio to replace running as it has been wearing out my knees. Im still on workout one beginner on this and I'm telling ya, it kicked my butt!!! I definitely felt my heart rate go up!! I wouldnt say you would get all over toned from this, but I definitely think its great little cardio!<br /><br />Im not able to skip the beginning, so it kinda has a slow start of the repeat but not too bad. She goes through pretty fast because there is no stopping during this 20 minutes
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My kids love this one better than the original.  We've only had it downloaded to my Kindle Fire for a few days and now it will not open.  Would love any feedback...
B00785P2QC|3.0|Just reviewiinng to get my coinage but i do like that this gm<br />game ccan be played offline too bye
B00B2V66VS|3.0|While I like the gameplay and the added features, there are still glitches to work out. The game kicks me out, steals coins and gems when trying to save myself.  Still fun, but needs work
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Couldn't put it down! As much as I love the show, the books are just as fabulous.. I can't wait to read the rest!
0439875889|4.0|My son loved this story when he was little, and now his three year old daughter does, too!  Great art work around the theme of the mother-child bond. Strongly recommend for toddlers and pre-schoolers.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game has amazon  graphics and is very fun. A bit more difficult than the other  Temple Run and Temple Run Brave edition. I recommend this to any user of  a device that can download this amazingly fun game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love your game ,but to the Xbox edition it's a piece of junk.Mange (if you want to) you should make minecraft 2.It can have everything like the Xbox.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surfers is a kid-friendly app. Like Temple Run and much more it can also be used for adults to. This app is my favorite app I have ever played.
0385504225|1.0|No kidding. I did not think I could ever say that, but I was hard pressed to finish it. It was tedious and boring at times, while at others being a Dan Brown book taking your breath away. Go figure. I would borrow it from the library instead of paying for it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|LOVED IT. They way it is written is beautiful. So real. So true. Just captured moments in life in a beautiful way.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I didn't want to put this book down.  Anyone that likes mystery and romance will love this book.  You need to pay attention to the dates at the start of each chapter because it goes back and forth in time.  Other than that it was a great book.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I've been a Harry Potter fan for years now and I love this movie set. It arrived in great condition and you'll want to have this for sure if you are a Harry Potter fan, get it, it's worth it.
B007ZTLLMK|3.0|A decent game, especially for a FAOTD, but it's chock full of Engrish, such as my review title. I have to wonder why app developers could spend so much time making a good game only to totally drop the ball when it comes to hiring a decent translator.
B005FUJNNU|4.0|This is not the best 3D due to the fact some of it was shot in 2D but it is well made none the less, colorful and Depp does a superb performance.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|This is just like the movies.  I had just recently watched every movie, including the cartoons, ever made.<br />There are some minor changes over the years, but even the conversations are almost word for word with<br />this book.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I don't really care for it, its not like all the other minecrafts, it don't have much stuff in it either
B009E3EY38|5.0|I guess you can say I'm more of a casual fan and not a tough critic.  I enjoyed the Blu-ray disc and don't have any real complaints.  If there weren't people mentioning how often they changed cameras, I'm not sure I would think it was done too often.  Zeppelin sounds great and I would recommend you buy it if you ever had any interest in them.  I would get on line to buy a concert ticket based on this performance from 2007.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I went to a movie a few days ago and saw the trailer for Mortal Instruments and on what I saw there decided to go ahead and pick up the first in the series for my Kindle.  Overall, I found it to be an engrossing book.  Sure, there are parts and pieces of it that can be compared to Harry Potter, Star Wars, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but that happens in nearly every book one reads anymore, especially if you go looking for it.  I found that Clare's writing was vivid, and the world she created as an underlay for the one we know was well-imagined.  The characters are interesting and I could see the potential in them.<br /><br />All that being said, the book had a solid four stars from me right up until the ending.  It wasn't that I felt so much that the ending was stolen from other sources, I just plain didn't like it.  At this point I'm still trying to decide if I want to give the second book in the series a chance and see where it goes from there.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I mean, of course Buy it. The book introduced me into a dark world of \\"damaged\\" people that caught me totally off-guard. Abandon all hope, ye who read it, SERIOUS MINDF***S expected.<br />Why the \\"DO NOT READ\\"? Although I am a experienced reader, I was given the sensibility to empathize with the protagonists of the stories I read, AND I ALMOST GOT NIGHTMARES FROM THESE ONES!<br />(PS: Amazing book, BTW!)
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I listen to my mp3 player on my weekly hikes up Camelback Mountain.  The volume put out by my player is often not adequate and the design is not conducive to volume adjustments on-the-go necessitated by the uneven sound quality of the podcasts that I am listening to.  With the E6 clipped to my shirt I can make easy volume adjustments. I do have 2 concerns. One is the plastic clip; it seems like the proverbial weak link.  Although it hasn't broken and they do send you 2 of them, I can foresee that being a problem in the (hopefully distant) future.  My other concern is the fact that they only send you connecting wires to connect to your computer for recharging the E6. Connecting electronics from China to my computer is problematic not knowing what spy-ware might be on there.  I have avoided this by using on-hand charging cords and charging via socket rather than plugging it into my computer.  I would be more comfortable with something made elsewhere.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|one of disney's better productions for this day and age. glad we found it since our vhs was ruined; thank you
0062202081|5.0|my daughter loved it, she's a huge Justin Bieber fan. Drives me crazy but she loved the book thank goodness,
630522577X|4.0|good classic. could do without the language but most persons wouldn't even bat an eye at words heard so commonly today
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I am really enjoying reading about the next generation of these connected families and reading how life changed in so many ways. There are parts, however, that are a bit dry as the politics of war are discussed in more detail than in Book One. No matter, this trilogy will stay in my top ten list of all time favorites-even though number 3 won't be out for awhile. I plan on continuing reading Ken Follett, and am looking forward to the journey!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|can't get enough of this; I loved watching it on tv when they used to play it each year. this is one classic owning is a must
B00006RIO7|5.0|Great movie, fun soundtrack.  Was wanting to get this for my wife as she was singing the song all over the place.  Great price and the autorip feature meant we could load up the music on portable devices and enjoy right away.  Feature worked right away with little hassle.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|loved this as a child and have enjoyed watching it with my children; glad Disney provided some quality movies before he passed on
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This item is great and a must for every kindle fire.. Well worth the weight in gold. Cheapest around town
B005K0HDGE|1.0|I guess I'm not a Stephen King fan and this is the first book I have read of his. It was too long, and it did not hold my interest. I found myself skimming lots of it just to get to the end. Some of my friends raved about this book, but it's not my style of reading.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|We anticipate being able to catch up with all our friends on this popular story.  I just noticed that it the Original UK Version which I hope plays on our USA equipment.
B003QSOFFO|2.0|There is a spoiler in this review.<br /><br />Setting aside the historical inaccuracies (if we wanted accurate historical information, Disney+Mel Gibson is probably one of the least reliable sources)  how does a movie where someone is murdered with a shotgun have a G rating??<br /><br />Aside from that, it's not that interesting.  Visually its appealing, and the animation is beautiful, but the content is sparse, and the perspective is extremely dichotomous.  Yes, we get that the explorers (prospectors) were greedy gold-grubbers who only wanted to murder savages.  Yes, yes, we get it.  It's a movie about fighting, making violence, and declaring war, interspersed with some heavy-handed greed and some pretty songs about nature and a love story.  That makes people suddenly able to speak other languages.<br /><br />The movie wasn't one I would buy (we rented) but I won't get it again once I realized that with a G rating, you can still kill someone with a shotgun.  Of course, if anyone showed any skin, it would be rated R, but killing people is OK for kids.  (???)  I guess that's not really an issue with this movie.  With this movie, I have the same problem I usually have with Disney: why all the violence in the kids movies?
B007NVJ7NU|5.0|Gorgeous visually and emotionally. Only con's would be a somewhat dated psychology and philosophy considering how contemporary all other aspects are. Highly recommended
B0049J0CTM|3.0|This is an adorable movie.  It is also unnescessarily scary.  I don't understand why they didn't just start the movie with just Nemo and his dad, instead of having that beginning scene.  It was too scary and intense for my 4 year old, and in my opinion, added nothing to the story to know that part of their background.  Especially for younger kids, who would have just accepted that he and his dad were on their own.<br /><br />That same scary sequence of various characters being chased by something growling and horrid looking, with sharp teeth, is repeated more than once.  In fact it seemed as if a good chunk of the movie was a character trying to outrun something scary trying to eat them.  I guess I am at a loss as to why we need all of these scenes that have the potential to be horrifying for some kids.  If you crank up the age range to account for the scary parts, you have kids who might be too old to be all that interested in this type of character's story.<br /><br />I probably won't let my daughter see it again until she is older.  I thought some of the characters were pretty adorable, but then again, I'm a heck of a lot older than my daughter.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun to PLAY! EASY GUIDES HELP. GREAT FOR KIDS AND ADULTS! GREAT FOR ICE AGE FANS! Try it out! Great free game!
B00338QENI|5.0|Rebecca Skloot tells Henrietta's story with compassion and without condescension, and the result is an engrossing book that reads like a novel. Moral and ethical dilemmas abound- expect to lose a little sleep over this one!
0316017930|5.0|What a great read ! Enlighting !  Now if we could only get the entire Obama Administration and our members of Congress to sit down and read this book we might turn our educational system around ........and in so doing, just might put our once great country back on track !
B009DJB8I2|4.0|If you've played Portal 2, then you will likely enjoy its soundtrack. If not, then unless you like dubstep or electronica, this is probably not the soundtrack for you. Personally, I had a blast listening along while imagining the sections of the game or elements of its presentation that each track was meant to represent. With over 4 hours of music, including the famous end credit tracks &#34;Still Alive&#34; and &#34;Want You Gone&#34;, this soundtrack will make a great addition to any Portal fan's collection.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great story that will warm your heart. I am more of a cat person, but the story will suck you in and make you want s puppy to snuggle with
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This temple run is better then the first. I like alot. I post out like all the time. It rocks!!!!!!
B00APUYN0I|3.0|The movie pixilated in several spots every time I tried to watch it.  Funny movie though!  Too bad the streaming quality was off.

B00881VLCE|4.0|As jigsaw puzzles go (and this is a REAL jigsaw...with the traditional pieces), this is the best I've found! It's easy to download new puzzles...many for free. You have the option to rotate pieces or not, easily increase or decrease difficulty. The scrolling pieces were a little difficult to get used to at first and I do wish there was a sliding workspace to work on pieces separately; otherwise the only thing some might find aggravating is that matching pieces, not attached anywhere else, will not click together unless they are facing the correct direction; however I have found that I really like that feature, particularly on more difficult puzzles. If you've been looking for a fun jigsaw puzzle game for your kindle, this one will keep you entertained
B00992CF6W|2.0|Love the game....wondering why the 0.6.0/0.6.1 version is available on Play Store, but not here???!!!! I mean it just doesn't make any sense at all!!!!!!

B009PJ1Q82|4.0|Professionally made with keen eye and craftsmanship of film making with mature directing, scripting, editing, and a perfect soundtrack.  Moves past the traditional gay culture stereo types to a neutral ground of non-judgemental observation of gay life grown up past the bars and tragic illnesses to the all too common human ground of needs expressed in coping mechanisms and relationships.

B001ACH4DS|5.0|My absolute favorite American Idol winner.  I LOVE his voice and music.  Can't get enough of it!  Everyone should buy and experience this wonderful voice and music!
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I had a really difficult time getting into this book. I put it down 3 times because it didn't capture me at first. Having said that, at about the 1/3rd mark I started to enjoy the book and found it genuinely entertaining. I can see how it would translate into a great Hollywood film. My one critique of the book is that it is not enough. I am left with too many questions. How will Clary and Jace resolve their relationship? What role will Simon play in Clary's life? What will it take for Clary's mother to come out of her spell and will Luke FINALLY get his chance? There are too many unresolved issues and as a reader, I am left a little dry. I appreciate books that entice you into reading the next in the series, but get upset with books that force you to do so by leaving you thirsty.<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL:<br />I recommend this book, but expect to put aside enough time to read the next stories.
1469984202|5.0|I ran across this book as a suggested read on a list somewhere in the depths of the interwebs.  I had no idea of the backstory behind the author.  I am incredibly impressed with the storytelling, prose, and layout of the novel.  It was an intriguing read from beginning to end and destined to be a sci-fi classic.<br /><br />READ IT NOW!

B00835UWAC|4.0|When I moved from the US to Thailand nearly 20 years ago, one of my biggest regrets was having to leave behind some of my music collection. The fabulous soundtrack to \\"Across 110th Street\\" was one of those that didn't make the journey with me due to baggage limitations (which would be far worse nowadays!). In any case, I rejoiced at getting the chance to buy this CD again, and now it has a bonus disc that contains two Bobby Womack albums from the same era.<br /><br />\\"Across 110th Street\\", released in 1972, is indeed a classic soundtrack, and the title track in particular has gained renewed popularity after being used in Tarantino's \\"Jackie Brown\\" soundtrack in the 90s. But this soundtrack has much more than a few cool Bobby Womack songs. In fact, the glue that holds the soundtrack together are the instrumental contributions from J.J. Johnson, who composed and conducted the musical score to the film, co-wrote the title cut with Womack, and supplies more magic along the way. If you like Johnson's compositions on here you should also check out the other amazing soundtrack he did in the 70s, \\"Cleopatra Jones\\". Great stuff!<br /><br />40 years after it was released, \\"Across 110th Street\\" still stands as one of the better soundtracks of the \\"Blaxploitation\\" era. Although it barely cracks the 30-minute barrier, the music is all outstanding. Five stars on its own. The bonus disc with this package contains two studio albums by Womack; his 1973 album \\"Facts of Life\\" and the 1974 followup \\"Lookin' For a Love Again.\\" I had heard many of those songs before, thanks to various Womack compilations that I own, but I had never heard each album in its entirety, so a lot of these tunes were new to me. As with many studio albums of that era, there are some gems and some filler. Many of Womack's orginals are very solid if not splendid, but some of his cover attempts (\\"All Along the Watchtower\\" and \\"A Natural Man\\") are less pleasing.<br /><br />This CD set includes a nice booklet with track details, a bit of history about these albums, and a synopsis of Bobby Womack's recording career by Roger Dopson. A well done package that is housed in a sturdy hardcover gatefold case.ack details, a bit of history about these albums, and a synopsis of Bobby Womack's recording career by Roger Dopson.

B008J34466|5.0|I love this CD as I do all of her CDs.  I'm playing it over and over so I can be prepared for her concert here at the Yum Center next month.  Yeay!
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Thought the plot line was very light, the writing, just so, so, and I couldn't wait to finish it.  I will not buy any more of his books.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Michael Buble has a smooth voice and great delivery.  Listening to this CD is always a joy. Most of the songs are rather romantic, and Crazy Love is one of the few CDs I can get my boyfriend to spontaniously dance to in the kitchen with me. It's also great for dancing by myself, if I'm in the mood.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Can't really put my finger on it, but had a hard time wading through this book.  I thought there would be more inneraction with the tiger, and Pi simply didn't get my affection.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|lOVED THE MOVIE. THOUGH THE FIRST ONE IS BETTER. bUT THATS THE WAY IT IS WITH A SEQUELS. WAS WORTH RENTING AND WATCHING
B006LSZECO|1.0|This was recommended to me by Amazon and I was very disappointed in the plot, the characters and the novel as a whole.  No more from that author.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome, if you're in to that kind of stuff, takes a little bit to download though, its worth it. if you do get this app though(and trust me on this) dont spend all your gems right away!!!! i can not stress that enough!!!!!#
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As usual, I thought I would be into this book throughout the weekend, but couldn't put it down til I finished it.  Great action.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I really, really like when a book mesmerize me and that's what happend till the last page of the Maze Runner trilogy. Lots of action and the author treat the reader like a been capable of interpret; there a lot to be taken between the lines. I feel sad for every single person that says the ending is disappointing, it's actually a quite good one! Few authors have the guts not to give the obvious/expected answer. Not everything need to have an answer.
B003O86FMW|4.0|After reading the Hunger Games, I just had to have the next one and was not disappointed.  It was a good read.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is very fun to play and everybody is welcome to play it. All ages will be able to play this awesome game.
0470913029|5.0|Just what I ordered.  Now I just need to read it and make sure that I know how to follow the plan.  Up to me now.
B00992CF6W|3.0|There is an updated version on Google Play store that I am not seeing here.  Wish it had the latest.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I would like to be able to buy more things, such as more people or board.  Also I like Rio more then new York.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|the book missed to create a link between the reader and any character, that's the only problem i can point the rest of the book is a pretty good critic to many of society values.
0765325950|4.0|Don't give up on the series, the ending is worth it.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson gets the point of the books and finishes it perfectly with everything I loved about Jordon's style and nothing that I didn't like about his writing.
0765325950|5.0|Well written, and poignant at times, most readers of the Wheel of Time series should be pleased.  Personally, I was just glad the series was over :D
8866131350|4.0|This was great.<br /><br />I would warn you about this.<br /><br />The 18 months starts at July the year before, so half of my calendar is old and you would not want to rip the pages out.<br /><br />It has a very classic look and feel to it that makes you feel like you should be opening it while pulling a cigarette out of a metal case and drinking a brandy.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I never write movie reviews anywhere, but I feel I have to write one for this movie.<br />Many movies that I've seen at the theaters aren't worth of seeing more than once, not even mentioning of having them at home. This movie is a rare exception. In my opinion, it's a very touchy and romantic movie. I loved the actors' play and how the storyline was developing, especially how the response letter played out (don't wanna say the details in order not to ruin readers' expectations). Despite the fact that the book has a different ending (according to at least 1 review here), I loved how the movie ended; I think that considering everything that happened before the dance, it had to be the dance that actually brought them together. Both Lawrence and Cooper were amazing in the movie. Besides that, the movie opened up a new movie star to me because I've never heard of Jennifer Lawrence before. Can't wait for this movie to come out in HD format. Definitely a must-have at home!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Must See. Perfect character portrayal by all actors. Gets better the second time you watch it. Shea gets better with each film.
B0065FFMR0|4.0|This is a great series.  I too thought is was a little too raunchy for regular cable.  I kept saying \\"  This comes on t.v.?\\" Nevertheless,  I found myself scared and unable to easily fall asleep. I often screamed out loud watching this show. Thus it is a true American Horror Story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing. As soon as it was over I wanted to start reading it again. Strong, interesting and lovable characters.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|Wasn't sure if this was going to work (considering some of the other reviews I had read) - plugged it in to my ipod dock (on a Sony stereo) and plugged in to my HTC One phone - WORKED PERFECTLY!!!  Very happy!
B0068RHGJM|5.0|This is a great album.  From a great band.  Tuomas Holopainen is a musical genius, and I will blindly buy anything he has a hand in because I know it will be epic.
1596680296|5.0|Knitting socks is NOT difficult.  Ann Budd is an expert at this craft.  This book is great for beginners who are intimidated by complicated patterns.  The authors gives a clear, concise explanation for all yarn weights and construction techniques.
B007SY3CEW|4.0|fun app to play around with. My grandson loves this app.  Wish they would come out with one that plays regular songs on it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really like this game. It's challenging and keeps your brain going and is never boring. It keeps my moving and I advance in every day I things. Overall it's a great game that is not only fun but works parts of my mind I don't use all the time. I love it!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Another free app that is not too bad unless you want to play other variations of the game, then you have to go online and then be bombarded with popups!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have been pondering how I would review this book since about the third chapter. Each night I read and each night I thought and thought as I lay in bed. I could NOT get this story and these people, Nick and Amy out of my head... It has been years since a book has made me feel the one this one has. Does that make me crazy?<br /><br />The lovely and talented Amy Elliot Dunne goes missing on the morning of her 5th anniversary. She is married to suave and grinning Nick Dunne and from there it gets dark and twisted.<br /><br />The story is told in alternating points of view, Nick's internal monologue and Amy's Diary. With each chapter we learn something new about the investigation into Amy's disappearance and the progression of their \\"love\\" story. Usually I don't enjoy this mode of storytelling, if the author is not skilled it can cause confusion, but Flynn does an excellent job here, a tidbit here, a clue there. Is Nick guilty? Did he kill her? This device drives the reader deeper into the thrilling world of the Dunnes.<br /><br />I knew there was a twist. I think knowing, but not knowing made this book even better. I waiting with baited breathe with each turn of the page, would the next page, the next chapter reveal this wonderful twist?<br /><br />It happens and it blows your mind.<br /><br />I have not read any of Gillian Flynn's other novels, but they will be added to my to-read list immediately. This author is deft at painting inky black pictures and I want more.<br /><br />Not only was this definitely a page turner, but I would have to say it was wicked fun to read. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys playing in the dark.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I love Disne/Pixar flims, however this is one of the best ones I have seen in a while! I loved the main character and the story is important to any woman who has every not seen eye to eye with their mother!
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Very entertaining.  Clint Eastwood is getting old.  Good lessons in the movie.  Young people need to know that technology cannot replace  lessons learned by living.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I must say I was a bit hesitant to watch Ted, it seemed like a pretty good chance it would be your normal &#34;bad&#34; comedy with no plot or meaning, but this movie suprised me! I throughly enjoyed it!
0399157565|1.0|A return to the old Scarpetta?  One of her best?  Intense?  Thrilling?  YA GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!<br /><br />I have been a long time reader of the Kay Scarpetta series.  Yes, I do vividly remember early Dr. Scarpetta and have been continuing to purchase books in the series in hopes of seeing the old Kay re-emerge.  I'm sorry to report that she still has not!  Cornwell's writing continues to be plagued with very poor plot and character development.  This work is bogged down with excessive details, which makes for an agonizingly SLOW read.  Nowhere is the Kay of old . . . with the exception that once again she is being victimized by someone.  And she continues to fail to stand up to her maverick niece who treats her like crap and brazenly breaks all kinds of laws in the \\"pursuit of justice.\\"  Gimme a break!  Does Cornwell think we're all idiots?<br /><br />After slogging through page after page after page of details, the ending came very abruptly and it was a total, \\"You've got to be kidding me!\\" moment.  I won't say more than that as I don't want to spoil it for others.  I will say that I was both disappointed and disgusted. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY on this book!<br /><br />It's time to play taps for Kay Scarpetta and lay her to rest.  This is the last book I will purchase in the series.  Watching both Scarpetta's and Cornwell's continual decline has simply become too painful.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is the best Disney Pixar yet!  I'm so glad that the princess is FINALLY the hero and not waiting around for her prince to save her!!
B002DKF55K|5.0|I believe this is eno's crowning achievement (at least in the pop music format). The sounds and textures used throughout the songs are amazing. He truly is a genius inside the music studio. There is a nice mixture of songs on this album ranging from ambient to pop, with plenty of great melodies. Highly recommended.
B00127RAJY|1.0|When I received this DVD it was damaged.  The shipping package was dented and torn.  The DVD case was dented, the plastic cover wasn't even there.  Then I opened the case and the DVD was bent in half and scratched.  I returned it for a refund.

B00846REIS|2.0|Not sure what to think!!!! Gideon just as messed up as Christen Gray!!!! Not impressed how immature Eva yeah she has issues but really stop running like a child face your fears don't think I will continue with next book
B004MPJZ1O|3.0|Although for the time in which it was filmed it was probably<br />very controversial. Looking at it now was not really that good of a movie.<br />acting was typical of B movies in that time. it was okay.

0062068415|5.0|This intriguing novel starts quietly, mild conflicts and suggested menace not taking enough form for the reader yet to grasp. I had to read the blurb on the back cover to continue through the first few chapters where nothing on the surface seemed to happen except for a vague sense of unreality. But pay attention. Things are happening every minute in all directions. Nothing is quite as it seems.<br /><br />The writing is stunning. Lehane is a master of the slow, inexorable build-up of subtle pressures, ever wider, ever deeper. The reader must put all his senses on alert, watch every word, especially of the back-story continually woven into the present story. And each time an element of backstory is repeated, another layer is added. It's the construction of a complex edifice one brick at a time. Never have I been so drawn onward by dialogue. You can hear in your ear the staccato, sardonic exchanges between Chuck and Teddy, vital to the plot line, and evidence on the first page of an old friendship between strangers. Or... are they really, after all, old friends ??<br /><br />also for historical fiction check out<br />[[ASIN:0984725482 The Officer's Code]] by Lyn Alexander
B008458O3S|3.0|It was fun when I started playing it and it kept my attention for an hour or so but I just didn't have any desire to go back and play it afterward.  Not  a bad game, just not one of the best.

B00B7FXZQS|1.0|this movie was lame. i hope its the last one that is made under the paranormal activity name. any attempt to make another should be shut down befor it starts. that would be smart activity
B009YP9L7U|3.0|The premise is that neither character believes in marrying for love and then they get drunk, get married, and fall in love.  It proved to be a series of sex scenes without much plot.  The characters are either so much in lust that they don't think or so angry that they're screaming and slamming doors and never talking to each other ever again.  I wish someone would write books about characters talking to each other to find out if they're compatible before they fall into bed..........maybe that's just a MH counselor's fantasy.

B00004STPT|4.0|Good music and the quality and the depth and the help transcend the ordinary and make this movie an exceptional one.  Hans Zimmer has the quality of writing extraordinary music.
B0038P59A0|4.0|Downey brings a new energy to the character and Watson is much more interesting than usually depicted.  In my opinion, this version captures the setting for time and place while updating the characters to ones more easily identifiable to modern audiences. And that is a quality I applaud. Story line is good as well.

B0000042MY|5.0|The soundtrack is one of the best because whenever you hear it you are immediately transported back to the scene in the movie and it irrevocably anchors it.  Very unusual for this to work like this.
145210655X|5.0|I chose this book because my husband has gotten our son into Star Wars and i thought this would be a great read for the both of them. Needless to say, our sone read it straight through twice before putting it down. He loves the book. Jeffery Brown did an excellent job!!!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I simply love this book. It is a masterpiece of world's literature. The formatting is OK, even if I would prefer to see the text justified.
0143121006|4.0|Midnight in Peking is the true story of the vicious killing of a British diplomat's daughter, nineteen year old Pamela Werner.  Her brutalized body was found along the old Ming wall at the foot of the Fox Tower in what was then called Peking.  It was January 1937.  The young woman's corpse was desiccated and half frozen, her tartan school girl skirt torn, her heart missing.  The sordid tale of Pamela's life and death enthralled Peking's expat community  with rumors of fox spirits and mistaken identity and in the end it exposed corruption and negligence at the highest orders of two governments.<br /><br />From its outset, Midnight in Peking  is necessarily gory, but what makes this book worthwhile is how it blends criminal investigation with a alluring cast of characters and a forgotten city.  At its core, this is a book about a place that has all but evaporated.  January 1937 was the beginning of the last year of a Peking the world would never see again.  It was a city in which white expats and ordinary Chinese people coexisted in a tense rat's nest of political intrigue, suspicion and fear.  At the time of Pamela's murder, Peking was a last bastion for lost souls.  It was populated in large part by White Russians, exiles, Jewish refugees and stateless people who had long ago shed their skins, their identities and their claim to any kind of legitimate legal life.  Chinese warlords imported American and Canadian body guards  who wanted to forget their often criminal pasts and biracial hermaphrodites ran cabarets with &eacute;lan, sliding effortlessly between genders and races while Russian whores succumbed to heroin addictions in the back rooms of brothels.  In 1937 Peking expats were living in the last days of city that was quickly slipping away.  Most of them just didn't know it yet.<br /><br />Right in the thick of it, the mutilated body of a young English woman becomes a symbol of all the depravity and human debris contained within the city walls.  Pamela is the unlikely personification of Peking's perverse underbelly and a portent of what was already looming in the hills above the city.<br /><br />Pamela Werner's story is a scintillating blend of slaughter, deception and history.  Pamela, a grey eyed, fair haired girl, seems almost banal at first, but she is actually the strange embodiment of Peking's fraught expat population.  She began her life as an orphan, one of the many unwanted offspring of the White Russian residents of the city who often languished in dense poverty. She was adopted by a British diplomat, the preeminent Sinologist and all around unlikable eccentric, E.T.C. Werner.  Pamela was fluent in Chinese and lived quite happily in the bifurcated world of Peking.  There was no one quite like her in her circles and the true reality of her existence and experience uncoils itself throughout the course of the book.  In the end, Pamela's story  exposes the worst side of a beguiling city as well as the darkest heart of human nature.<br /><br />Paul French is a accessible, precise writer.  He tells the story as a lost history and vividly resurrects obscure characters with complete personalities.  The author creates a portrait of Peking that is as bewitching as it is bizarre and in doing so captures a fascinating moment in the city's life when it teetered on the brink of war.<br /><br />A year after Pamela's murder the Japanese invaded Peking from the hills that surrounded it, sundered and victimized the city, massacred an untold number of Chinese and interred the remaining expats (including Pamela's father).  The grey eyed girl who was left butchered in a ditch was all but forgotten.  If it wasn't for her strange father, who exhausted his personal fortune by financing a private investigation, Pamela and her tragic tale would have been entirely lost.  But E.T.C. Werner was relentless and he left behind his extensive notes, which, in the deft hands of Paul French, reveal not only the identity of Pamela's killer but also the perverse underbelly of long lost Peking.<br /><br />Pamela Werner is buried somewhere under the second ring road in a city that now bares almost no resemblance to the place she knew and loved.  As Beijing continues to grow and shape shift I found it endlessly interesting to learn about how this place was once, not so long ago, when war waited in the hillsides and Fox spirits haunted the  old Ming wall in a prodigal city.<br /><br />(review originally published on OceanPerson.com)perverse underbelly of long lost Peking.<br /><br />Pamela Werner is buried somewhere under the second ring road in a city that now bares almost no resemblance to the place she knew and loved.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Game is very addictive and awesome I play against my friends and my Dad. This has got to be one of the best games I have...I highly recommend it for you and your friends.
B001CZVVXW|5.0|I've seen Carmen several times but I've never seen one as passionate or as physical as this one. The leads are incredible, especially Mr. Kaufman whose powerful, &#34;dark&#34; voice brings an entirely new energy to the role. The staging is very good and the blu-ray version fully brings out the music and detail in the set design. A fabulous opera, incredibly well done!! Seriously worth your consideration!!
B000B589JI|4.0|I liked it for a spare back in case i run out of fuel tell i can get more fuel
B00000IBVC|4.0|Though not the strongest vocal cast ever compiled, this version of Turandot rewards with its staging in &#34;The Forbidden City.&#34; The chorus is massive, the performers passionate and the pace by Maestro Mehta, excellent! If you are seeking the spectacle of Turandot in its proper setting, this is what you're looking for!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I got My Horse today and played on it straight away for about 30 minutes, and thought that it was really good fun and interesting seeing as though I've never tended to a horse before. But then I thought that it started to get a bit repetitive and was taking a long time to build up the things needed to buy things like clothes, tack and entering competitions, but it is good fun for short stints of time.
B00991TCOG|5.0|The songs on the CD are very good. Lindsey has a very great talent for combining her violin with pop. A cvery good buy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surf is sooooooo addictive. I absolutely love subway surf<br />And the themes that they do. TEAM SUBWAY SURF!!!!!!!! This game is much better<br />Than Temple Run, or any other game.

B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This games graphics are by far the best I have seen for a slender game. The only problem is that as long as u never look at slender u are fine. The pages are all very easy to find and there is no challenge or scare factor. This game would be over the top if the scare was amped up and pages were harder to find. Still a good game tho.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Love. Thos is not the first thing that comes to mind when reading this .the 6 other books were great too
B0063IH60K|5.0|Its just your standard good fun solitaire. Gets the job done in the fun department, no real bull and fun when you win lol.

B00B7FWWNA|4.0|Astonishinhly graphic, but real, documenting a reality those nit exposed to it, must know.<br />However, sex scenes qere depicted tastefully, not at all like a porn movie.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|Complete and the rest of this book is the first time in the world  I have ever read the rest of it
B004TL0J5M|4.0|holds the interest well.<br />Courtroom tactics revealing and<br />story held suspense to the end.<br /><br />on a 1 to 10 : 7
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is so different than anything you'll find in the teen section. I don't know if I can put it in to words. It was special.
B004ZA9HB4|2.0|The channels offered as choices did not work on my television and even if they had they were not channels or shows that I would be interested in viewing.  It also did not work on my Kindle Fire.  Even if it did not work with my TV , I may have liked it if there were more channels to choose from and I could have watched it on my Kindle.
B00932AA5G|5.0|I all, I thought this movie was better than expected. I thought this movie had interesting twists and believe it or not, tells a great story of survival.
B006G7Y7GY|5.0|I could not put this book down! I found myself constantly laughing out loud at the antics written inside it's pages. It's all written in the same way Ozzy talks, so it's like you can hear him telling the stories. I love it! By far, one of my top favorite books in my collection. So very well written.
B001TODCII|5.0|I purchased this CD for my daughter and grandchildren to watch and insisted that they watch the CD prior to my daughter and granddaughter's trip to New York last year.  My daughter and granddaughter were also quite insistent that it was safe for my granddaughter to travel alone to Korea to visit one of her Korean friends.  Instead of watching only a little bit of the CD, my daughter and grandchildren were spell bound and could not stop watching this CD and learning from it.  The contents were instilled in their minds, so much so, any future plans for my granddaughter to travel alone to Korea have been squelched.  Also my granddaughter who prior to the film told her Mom that she wanted to be with her friends while in New York and didn't want her Mom to be following her around now begged her Mom not to let her out of her sight.  You can tell young and older people about what to be careful of when traveling, etc.; however seeing what could happen and did happen is ever so much more powerful than the spoken words.  This DVD should be shown to all young teens and older students plus their parents.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This was a real page-turned for me. Good character development. Great plot. Lots of twists and turns. And oh my goodness, now when I hear about denial of service attacks from China I'll sit up and take notice. It even went through my mind that there could have been something sinister behind the electrical problems at the Super Bowl last night.<br /><br />Just remember...just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean they're not out to get you!<br /><br />Great read.
B003UESJHO|5.0|This true story is heart-rendering and well worth watching; and 'tis no wonder that it won an Academy Award.  It was quite exciting to watch.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I borrowed this book from the Kindle Owners' Lending Library and finished it in three days!  What a page turner!  I literally could not put it down.  I don't know what I'll do with myself for the rest of the month!
B00A2BTCXI|5.0|This new CD of 2112 has great sound.  The blueray version of the album is cute but frankly after watching it once I will probalby never watch it again.  But the remaster of the CD is well worth buying this new edition.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|The game is too short and too easy (though you can change the settings), but it's cute. I wish the UI was much better and there was more to the game play than just racing to collect 8 notes in order to win.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|this book is very hard to read. Does not grab your attention, seems to drag on. I read several chapters & set it aside, will give up & go see the movie instead. I didn't read this in school
B000W93CHC|5.0|How mauch misery and how much luxury! Side by side. And then comes the pest and does not make a dfiffrence between rich and poor fanatically religious and rather common sense. It is however surpriing that the principal characters were saved. Also a very touching and most believable love story! What a nice unexpected happy end. A good introduction to the fall of the Titans and the little English society moved during 600 years.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Wish these books were true. His views of politicians I believe to be true. enjoyable reads. Can't wait for the next one.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Intel does it again. A very fast, powerful and fairly cool running chip. I matched it with an ASUS P8Z77-V motherboard and Windows 8 Pro and have been enjoying trouble free computing. Intel rocks!
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Zero stars really. I have seen every gag and heard every joke in other better movies.  Not funnier because a stuffed animal is involved.  I was bored.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its awesome my kids love to play it all the time it keeps them every intertained fun and its nice when we are on little trips or even long trips but its a very fun game.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I liked the movie because it was fast paced, pretty well acted, and full of action. Would reccomend for most people.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|If you've ever been to the isle of Lewis, you'll love this book.  It evoke the atmosphere perfectly and its descriptions of places and atmosphere re right on.  I regret that more of his works are not available on Kindle.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|It works great if you are just lurking. When using the new updated Kindle version, heaven help you. At some point, you will type something that contains a friend or liked interest and you will not be able to type what you intended to. I guess when I actually need to post something, I will need to go pick up my iPhone.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I really love the game its so awesome! ill give it 5 stars . its so addicting and I chose the zombies sore because I don't really like the samurai side
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I love this game and gameloft. hey gameloft good job at makeing these games there kinda like remakeing counsal games to fit in mobile.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I loved this movie the first time I saw it. Yes, I am a big kid at heart and I love movies like this. The characters are adorable... especially the unicorn &#34;it's so fluffy!&#34;<br />If you are kid at heart, this movie should be in your collection.<br /><br />Two thumbs up!!
B007N9FKCY|2.0|I installed this a while ago as the FAOTD but have only recently started playing it.  It's a cute concept &amp; different from everything else I have played but it the first time I tried to open it it froze up my tablet causing me to have to reboot.  I played for about 30 minutes, left the game, came back, &amp; it was very laggy beforw freezing up again.  The controls look easy &amp; pretty basic but I found them very awkward to use.  That could be just me or that I am using a tablet to play this on but I often found myslef holding both controls down.  It does get harder as you procede &amp; say there are missed gems when I couldn't find any reachable location that they would be.  I think the difficulty of some things increased too fast.  It needed to allow the user time to adjust to different types of contraptions before throwing them all together.<br /><br />Over all, my issue is with the force closings.  An update may help but my tablet says it's up to date.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This app is okay. The update makes all your old data restart,  so its hard to finish the games without updating. The games are fun to play. But other than that, DON'T EVER UPDATE THE GAME UNLESS YOU WANT TO START OVER!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The first of the book was great, the middle was long and somewhat tiring, but the last...wow! I was glad for the monologue.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Much of the characters' personal struggles are left ambiguous and I found that really refreshing, Moonrise Kingdom never loses focus from the immediate plot for the sake of tragic pasts.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Have nearly all King's books and this was very intriguing as well as spellbinding.  I give it a thumbs up.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Fun, a great test on your nerves, but I still love it and count to ten many times, smile and try again..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! Battling friends, myself, and my reaction time has lead to my score of 206,000. An amazing game.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I like that my kindle can stand, I like that it can't fall out. I also like the color it pops a little bit so I can find it... Im always loosing something and this made things helpful.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Bought this movie for my Grand Daughter's birthday. I know that she will love the movie when she gets it for her birthday!!
B006YC74E8|4.0|This is a great camera app. I have no problems with it. It takes the pictures that I need. The effects are not the best, but at least they tried.
B002361MLA|5.0|Ordered this book for a future read!! I am looking forward to reading this book and know that it will be very uplifting as the writer is!
B006LTP9QY|5.0|Better than the movie on so many more levels!  Would recommend to anyone who has seen the movie and loved it!

B00004TH7Z|5.0|Excellent
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app. It feels like a writer's dream to me. Wherever I am I can jot down my thoughts and ideas. Keep inspiration and quotes in one place.
B008FSCNTK|2.0|As a musician who likes and plays the style of music for which Diana Krall is renowned,I have all of her work on Cd and DVD.She is naturally super talented .and a natural musician.Therefore,on receiving and playing Glad Rag Doll,I was so disappointed.What on earth possessed her to go in 'that direction'? The material does not showcase her wonderful talent. As for the style and sound of the other musicians...well... they are probably good at what they do,but why pair them with  such a harmonically  sophisticated singer and musician of renown.? It is so raw and basic and amature sounding.Diana Krall.We love you and appreciate you and we look forward to a resumption of the music you are famous for.You really do not need to try and reinvent youirself.We love you just as you were!<br />I was wondering at first if I was so narrow minded and blinkered as a musician? However ,it seems that I am far from alone in my feelings and comments.I was certainly not moved  emotionally with this CD,more like irritated.I persevered with the whole thing,but doubt if I will ever replay it.REMOVED  BECAUSE NOT MOVED Please forgive me Diana
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a fun game that can be entertaining and frustrating at the same time. I like the mix of off and on line playing with only a single touch.
B002N5N5M0|4.0|I agree with all the other positive posts.  Excellent series.  Excellent season.  Well written.  Well acted.  Truly amazing.<br /><br />I'm only scoring it down one star because the simpletons who recorded this season to disc start with a blaring Showtime ad about how \\"You're...always in control\\", yet prohibit skipping the section, prohibit fast forward, and prohibit hitting menu...all on the disc I paid them for.  I'm in control.  Right.<br /><br />Also, they set up the chapter breaks so that the prior episode review, the credits AND the first segment of the episode are all in one chapter.  This means the buyer cannot simply hit next chapter to skip the review or the credits.  I have to fast forward past all of that and watch for the beginning of the show.<br /><br />I completely understand that all of these complaints are truly trivial in the face of such an excellent show.  Still.  If they bothered to structure the recording better, they'd have that last star from me.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Very functional, and allows one to have multiple alarms for different occasions. It is well worth the price, plus it tells you the weather forecast.
B00A757EFW|2.0|Couldn't even finish Level 2 unless I purchased the whole version. Don't waste your time go full version if you really want it.
0547258305|2.0|Another reminder for me to cautiously pick another YA books next time.<br /><br />The story begins with a prisoner extraction mission. This prisoner supposed to be an important plot device in the later story. The main character who lead the mission is Katsa, a royal assassin, a super killing human machine. Later, because of her involvement in investigating the prisoner's case, she will play a major part in the destiny of the realm.<br /><br />OK, now the critics.<br /><br />Firstly, the blend of teenage romance and fantasy theme in this novel is disastrous. I would have been better for the author to simply write a teenage romance with contemporary setting. It just does not fit. The fantasy does not add any spice to the romance, and the romance is ruining the fantasy. I have read some Harlequin type historical romance novel which are much better than this.<br /><br />I cannot seriously think that this is a fantasy novel. The magic design, which is the Grace, in this novel is laughable. The author makes it more like a mutant ability rather than magic. (Does not mean that being mutant is wrong, but it just does not fit well into the story line.) There are no explanation and exploration of the Grace, except that you are born with one. And the ability of the Grace can range from utterly useless to almost demigod capability. This kind of magic without restriction is really bad in literary sense, because the author can wield ANYTHING to solve any plot in the novel. This kind of literary device can be devastating, because it can made the character unstoppable. The only good thing I can think of the Grace is the struggle of characters with their ability. Even this is not fully explored by the author.<br /><br />Spoiler:<br />--------------------<br />The Grace, which is the magic in this novel, is a bit unbelievable. The main character's Grace, Katsa, in the beginning of the story line is a fighter. Which mean she has perfect body coordination, fast reaction, and power, which are an excellent design. But half way through the novel, the author somehow decided that her TRUE Grace is not fighting, but SURVIVING, which means she can endure any hardship, have a GPS in her head, and can make fire quickly, just to serve the plot because she has to endure the hardship of winter of a mountain pass. Why not make her immortal, and can grow severed limb! It is simply bad character design. Please, decide what you want to tell. The Grace of the side kick, Po, is also unbelievable. Initially, his Grace is some kind of mind reader, which makes him an excellent fighter, because he can predict his opponent's movement. But suddenly he later become a RADAR man, that can read his surrounding without opening his eyes, just to serve the plot because he becomes blind! Please, mind is not the same as object. We call it an object because it is mindless! And we suppose to sympathize with him? No way...<br />--------------------<br /><br />The world design is also raw, without any clear distinction of region specialty, except that one is the north, the other in the south, and mountain and sea, and so on. It does not serve as a focal point of the story. In a good fantasy story, the world itself IS a character.<br /><br />Secondly, the character design. The character does not really develop in the story. The job of the main character as a royal assassin is not reflected in the main character. The main character is just another teenager with self-identity issue, another common term in YA. It is also simply black and white, without gray area. It does not mean that black and white distinction is always bad, it is just it does not fit well in this novel.<br /><br />The usage of single POV from the main character give us the reader a single spotlight, and the author makes her always being the good-guy (to be exact good-girl) part. It is boring, knowing that she is always right, and will always survive no matter what. If she seems cannot make it, somehow MAGICALLY she manage it, because she is a survivor! Deus ex machina. Well, maybe not always survive in whole sense, because the author makes her HEART vulnerable (surprise... surprise..., something that you always find in YA novel).<br /><br />Thirdly, the worst part is the plot of the story. The plot unwrap too fast. It does not give you a sense of wonder and surprise. The plot twist is not really interesting. Almost everything is told in haste. Even the romantic part is not surprising.<br /><br />The solution of the story is also thoroughly simplistic. It strains my logic too much to believe to much. The author makes the villain very strong, but defeated easily. I feel cheated. If the villain can be defeated that way, it is a bit non sense to write a 300 page story. Too simple.<br /><br />I do not give this novel a ONE star, simply because it is not repulsive to me. I still manage to finish it, despite I will think twice to touch another novel from this author.<br /><br />My advice, if you want a fantasy novel, read a REAL fantasy novel. Maybe this novel is just for YA fans. Maybe I am too old already.nage it, because she is a survivor! Deus ex machina.

140053271X|3.0|The item is very complicated to use if you want to download public library books. quite an ordeal . you need first to get an adobe program then download book to computer etc. What is most objectionable is the pricing by amazon. The item is listed at $219 retail sold at amazon for $72 at a considerable markdown making it sound very attractive . Yet at Band N if you walk in, the same Nook is priced at $79 and you get a $20 gift card if you buy one . So there is something deceptive if not downright dishonest in the way the item is advertised at Amazon..
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I lick this book because it is funny and once you start reading it you don't want to stop and when you are finished you can read the next book.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|This album delivers a refreshing sound and a set of new faces to the country scene. It carries a good upbeat country tone throughout the entire album.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Not as good as original but it did have lots of action.  Why is there a minimum amount of words to these reviews?
B006FK7SZ4|5.0|Quick and easy way to meet various persons in the area. Nice, mixed membership, so I'm sure there is someone for everybody who joins, whether it be dating or friendship!
B008PQ8XZK|4.0|Very good book. It held my interest until the very end<br />and like with all good books I hated finishing it.  Kate Morton is<br />a  very good author!
0312641893|5.0|Setting: 4/5<br /><br />I really liked getting a glimpse into our world in the future. What I liked most about how Marissa dealt with the setting was the fact that she didn't ever spend pages upon pages world-building. That is seriously my least-favorite thing! Instead she scattered information throughout the novel giving us just what we need before or when we needed it. I think that is an ideal way to develop a world.<br /><br />As for the actual locations in New Bejing. I thought just enough information was provided for me to really picture each location. She doesn't spend a ton of time describing every last detail but the details that are provided help you to fill in the rest.<br /><br />Characters: 4.5/5<br /><br />I suppose I should get my one complaint out of the way first. I really wish we saw more of Peony and Pearl. I felt like they were hardly developed and that bummed me out, especially the lack of Pearl. It's clear by the end that she isn't all she appears to be, but that's it! Cinder spends so much time with her and I just want to get more insight into who she is.<br /><br />I loved the relationship between Kai and Cinder. It never once felt rushed or ridiculous. I think that's part of the reason why I love this book so much. They are clearly friends, who happen to have a mutual attraction. I also enjoyed each of them on their own. We don't know everything about them but as with the setting, we know enough and continue to learn more.<br /><br />I loved Cinder's android side-kick! She added so comical relief with her fantastic personality! Basically, I want one too!<br /><br />Plot: 5/5<br /><br />The plot was extremely predictable. However, it's a retelling so I'm not sure that's such a terrible thing. With that said there are enough deviations and unique ideas that make the story that much more exciting. I was never once bored with this book and I enjoyed the journey every step of the way. . . even when some crummy things happened to get in Cinder's way.<br /><br />Overall: 4.5/5<br /><br />With all of the above considered I would say that this story should be rounded up to a 5. Meyer does a fantastic job making the story of Cinderella fresh and exciting.y.<br /><br />Overall: 4.5/5<br /><br />With all of the above considered I would say that this story should be rounded up to a 5.

0425264351|3.0|I bought this book after the movie came out. I kept hearing how good the movie is which usually means the book should be much better. I was disappointed. It took me so long to get through the book. It felt like it dragged and dragged. I think David Baldacci's John Puller series is so much better than Reacher.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Fun story to read, but became so implausible, I found myself rolling my eyes quite a bit - particularly when the author insults you and me (that is correct grammar) by writing what I just did in the parentheses.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Ordered this movie for family movie night.  It was fantastic- a movie story with great actors & actresses.  My kids range in age from 5-11 yrs old and they all enjoyed this movie.  Does deal with the death of the owner at the end so be prepared with the tissue box but all of mine can't wait to watch it again.  I highly recommend for families of all ages.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awsome game but It needs faster power renewal it takes so long to get all the power back pls fix this then it's perfect
B0000C9JFO|5.0|This movie shows you a great view of students from different countries and even though they might not speak the same language, they know how to get a long.
0321127420|5.0|I actually read part of this book couple of years ago, but never had an opportunity to read it all.<br />If you are serious about programming, this is a 'must have' piece.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|I was hooked from the first time I watched this serie.  I love all the cast members and Ill say that Peggy is very hot.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great love story of strength, courage and hope ... all in the name of \\"survival mode\\".  I applaud Mr. Sparks for crossing the lines of comfort in this story and confronting what so many women endure yet keep locked away. If you're one of these women, make your plan and work it!  There are survivors like \\"Katie\\" in this world! Don't lose hope.
B005OP28XS|5.0|This is a very funny show and I really like watching it without commercials. Although the story lines  are somewhat predictable, the acting and execution are what make it worthwhile.

B007TVANDM|5.0|Fun story for our 4 year old. The story has a good rhythm and moral. The illustrations are eye catching and can help our son follow what's going on in the story.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|I decided to read this before I saw the film, and write this having not yet seen the film. As a 'faithful' agnostic atheist, 'lacking the imagination required to see the better story', I obviously didn't expect to be converted to God, as the hype behind the film claims.<br /><br />I did however find a book about religion which presented itself very much in the manner in which I understand it. It doesn't go through the same old tedious arguments, trying to explain why religion makes factual sense. Rather, it promotes the belief in those traditional stories as being preferable to facing reality. That's right, it's a story about faith.<br /><br />I found the core of the book very exciting. Almost like a daydreamed scenario or childhood game. Trapped on a boat with a tiger, with limited food and water - how would you survive? What would you be driven to do? I did find the few references to atheism and agnosticism, early on in the book, condescending and mildly irritating, but nothing worth discouraging anyone from reading this novel.<br /><br />Having read the book, I'm hesitant to risk ruining my memory by watching the film, but I will.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Our entire family (ages 8 - 40) love this movie. It is very funny. We plan to watch it every Christmas.
B0045HCJT4|5.0|Always love Kurt's movies this one is another favorite,keep the movies coming. This DVD came in very good condition wrapping was satisfactory.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I am a longtime Grisham fan, and adore the Theodore Boone series, which I find to be entertaining, fun, and a fast-read. I hope they make it into a television series. Might encourage kids to pursue degrees in law.
B009X01FJS|5.0|very easy pop my kindle in it, feels secure and turns on with an easy open. the leather is soft to the touch and very nice looking as well. definately would buy another if needed but I have a feeling that as sturdy as it is I won't have to.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am enjoying this game. It is clean fun and I would recommend this game for all ages. Especially fun when you want a horse but don't have the means to own one.

B000W93CHC|4.0|Well its a bit formulaic but its still a fun read so what's to complain about.  Follett is getting rich and I'm being entertained. And the world goes on.......without end.
B00APUQKDG|3.0|I was dissappointed in how the book was turned into a movie. I think that the characters themselves were good, but the scene play seemed slightly off.
B004UID2LC|5.0|have a new Iphone 4S , You Tube has reviews and teaches me how to do different things on the smart phone.
B0014BY72Q|4.0|Okay, the effects are dated, the acting is passable. But the story is just great. The old man (Ustinov) living in D.C. needed a larger part, he did it so well. A modern re-make of this film, with an extended ending, showing the hardships of life outside the dome would be fantastic. This movie is worth the cost and time to watch it.
B00A4YVHXQ|1.0|the idea is lovely, but the execution just didn't work for me.  the timing was so off that i couldn't get it to hit on more than 30% of the 'notes' -- wouldn't recommend -- and... it was free
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Really enjoyed this HOG/Adventure game. Good storyline, graphics (worked and looked great on my Kindle Fire 7&quot; HD), great length to the short-term not too short and not so long that it drags or is too complicated, and mix of HO scenes and puzzles etc. I like games like this that aren't just straight HO scenes, as it gets monotonous. I like having a storyline and objectives, finding objects randomly in different locations and not just through HO scenes and figuring out how to use them and solving mini-games puzzles. The story has many twists and turns, and just when you think you 're nearing the end, there is another twist. For the price it was a great game, great graphics, loved being able to zoom in on the HO scenes, great story line, and loved the bonus chapters. Recommended for those that like HOGs but with the adventure, storyline, puzzles, etc. If you are looking for a straight HO game, then this game would not be for you. There is a strategy guide if you get stuck, a hint button, a map that shows the active areas, a skip button for the mini-games if you find them too difficult or just don't feel like playing them, but it takes some time to charge, and you have the option of playing a game where you match cards instead of doing the HO scenes or just can't find an object and  don't want to use the hint button. Overall another great game from G5, a company whose games I seem to love, especially of this genre. Would definitely recommend this game and look forward to more games like this from G5 in the future!<br /><br />P.S. For those of you who have written in your reviews that this game isn't truly free, you are correct. Most G5 games are free, where you can try out the game and play a chapter or a few scenes and then if you like it you can purchase the entire game, which I believe was $1.99, a great price for  a good length, high quality, collector's edition of a great game. I personally like being able to try out part of the game to see if it's something I would even enjoy playing, unlike games from other companies/game developers where you pay for the game and end up  trying it and never playing it, therefore, wasting the $2-5 I spent for a game I will never play. There is a disclaimer in the game description advising that you will have to purchase in-game content, which almost always means if you want to play all of a free game, you will eventually have to pay for it if you want to unlock  the entire game, which is only fair to the developers who have put in their time and money to create these wonderful games and who will be able to create more games with the money and resources from other games they have developed and sold. It's not like you have to pay continuously to play the game just a one time lock and it will but unlocked on all of your android devices.I would even enjoy playing, unlike games from other companies/game developers where you pay for the game and end up  trying it and never playing it, therefore, wasting the $2-5 I spent for a game I will never play.

0937381888|5.0|This book is the bible of brewing. It's amazing how much information is given. I learned a lot and really enjoyed reading it, and i know even experts brewers would find this book usefull since it also containts very tecnical details.<br /><br />It's written in such a way that if you are a novice you can skip all the tecnical and scientific details and just follow the detailed instructions to brew you beer with no problems.<br /><br />Also, being a scientist my self, I found really interesting to find how much science is involved in brewing.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|I saw this CD and started reading the reviews, listened to the samples and was wowed! Ordered it immediately and I can honestly say that it is a great product!  I will be shocked if this group isn't receiving Grammy awards for this masterpiece!
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I'm not big on point-and-click games, but I think because this app serves the puzzles up in small doses I find it very fun.  I'm maybe 15 floors in, and so far I'm surprised at how much I like this.  Hunt for clues, figure our how to open the elevator doors.  That's it, but it's strangely compelling.<br /><br />I'd probably give it 4.5 stars if I could.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|All the Harry Potter movies together, just fabulous. The movies get better as the characters age and mature. A definite must for any collection.

B0055MBQOM|5.0|Realizing I couldn't dependably calibrate my monitor the same way every time made me decide to purchase an Xrite Colormunki. After extensive research I decided to purchase this Xrite product and am fully satisfied that I made the right choice. The price was low and the results were high. Now I own a reliable calibration tool that will ensure color correction every time. Great product.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|This could have been a great movie if they would have left it out of the Alien universe and let it stand on its on.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I am not ashamed at all that I am an almost 25 y/o female and watched this movie by myself. This is worth buying. The storyline was great, the humor was no point and I wish that they would make a sequel. Great twist on all of the monsters :)
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Usually I am not someone who gets caught up in poor writing style, I've definitely read my fair share of poorly written books.  That's why I could \\"hardly believe\\" (yes, that is a reference to the book, the author is apparently in love with this saying and uses it on average once every other screen) it when I found myself wanting to put this book down before finishing it because of the writing. I ended up finishing it because I wanted to know what happened but my curiosity barely won out.<br /><br />Let me start with the good.  The plot was good, not too original and kind of predictable but it's a good plot and I was drawn in.  I'd like to finish this series out but apparently book 2 isn't the end so I probably won't, not going to waste the money on such poorly written books.  The plot bumped this review up to 2 stars.<br /><br />Now on to the writing.  A few years back, I decided to write my own book.  I spent a fair amount of time coming up with the first rough draft but haven't completed it and know there's a lot of editing to do.  The level of writing in this book is equivalent to what I wrote, it's bad and I'll be the first to admit it.  It honestly felt that the author didn't spend any time editing her own work.  How else could you get sentences such as, \\"It was better for him to face death now, he figured, in the face then to always live in fear of it\\" or \\"Huge, wearing only loins, with immense muscled chests.\\"  Then there's my personal favorite, the \\"hardly believe\\" phrase. This phrase is used at least once every other Kindle page. I felt like the part in Princess Bride where the one guy keeps saying, \\"Inconceivable\\" and Inego Montoya (sp?) replies, \\"I do not think that word means what you think it means\\" (or something like that).  I do not think that phhrase means what the author thinks it means and, regardless, I do not think any book should have that phrase used even half as many times as this book.  I could \\"hardly believe\\" how many times it was used.<br/><br />That being said, I honestly believe that if the author were to take the time to edit her own work, this could be a great book and series.  I could \\"hardly believe\\" it if she couldn't produce a more well written book.  She obviously didn't bother to take the time though.  That kind of laziness is, quite frankly, a little insulting to her readers because it comes across like improving our reading experience isn't worth her time.  As long as people keep buying this, who cares?  SO, PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!!<br /><br />Overall, this could be a great book with a little time devoted to editing and improving the writing.  If the author spends the time doing that, I'll definitely want to buy the next installments and I'll be happy I get to finish the story.  But until that happes, again, PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!!  You'll \\"hardly believe\\" you wasted your money on it.

B0052RDHTM|4.0|This novel involves the events leading up to and including World War I from the point of view of characters who live in various countries involved in the war.  I found it an entertaining way to learn more about this period of history; the English lord and his family seem quite similar to what has been portrayed in the PBS series, Downton Abbey.  The characters are believable and likeable.

B0094AH3MU|3.0|A \\"poor\\" opera by Verdi? Yes, there are at least two examples of these: this one and \\"Alzira\\". Personally, I rate this one just slightly superior due to its rousing choral music. Indeed, the famous composer made liberal use of a male chorus as would be indicated by the title of the work - \\"The Bandits\\". Their best piece occurs in the third act when they proudly proclaim that as brigands they enjoy \\"stealing, killing, whoring, and fighting\\"; not exactly saccharine lyrics. The major problem with the opera is its libretto, which centers on the rivalry of two brothers for a woman and a title; it's the stuff for high drama but somehow leads to a totally improbable resolution. The \\"evil\\" brother commits suicide because the priest won't absolve him and the \\"good\\" brother kills the woman he loves so he can be true to the gang of bandits that he leads. The weakness of the opera is compounded by this production. Another reviewer, Noam Eitan, has written a marvelous critique with which I am almost totally in agreement, so I will not be redundant. I disagree with him on the merits of the lead tenor, Aquiles Machado. As a lyric tenor, he had no business tackling the role of Carlo, which calls for a dramatic and forceful, almost Wagnerian, performance; I found his voice unpleasant and despite the fact that he received warm applause from the audience at the Teatro San Carlo, when the cameras panned the audience at the end of the opera, I noticed that there were a considerable number of empty seats, so perhaps, others shared my perception. In the role of Amalia, his beloved, Lucrecia Garcia exhibits a beautiful soprano voice, however, I hope that her acting ability will improve with experience. Case in point: when she encounters the lover she thought dead and should be running into his arms, she sings, not to him, but to the audience! Machado embraces her but commits the same fault - is he looking at the prompter? Director? Conductor? Look into her eyes, for God's sake! Eitam's review does not mention Artur Rucinski, a phenomenal baritone who, as Francesco, the evil brother, delivered the best performance of all the actors/singers. Not only does he have a powerful vocal instrument, but his acting as a mentally and physically deformed individual is brilliant; he had to sing and emote while dragging around a right leg and foot that seems to be in a cast. This man should be phenomenal as \\"Rigoletto\\". Without him and the conductor, the production would merit even less than three stars. As regards the Unitel Classica Blu Ray version, be aware that even though it offers subtitle and audio options, you may have some difficulty finding the menu they appear on. Perhaps, the recording company will make the menu items easier to access in future editions of this disc.

B005LAII80|5.0|NOTE: I don't write reviews for products unless they are THAT good.<br /><br />Dredd is one of the best future crime movies I've ever seen.  I just watched it for the first time the other day.  I've watched it 5 times since.  This movie is serious - I would've never know since I didn't even hear about it coming out in theatres!  I'm sooooo angry right now that I wasn't able to see this in 3D!  It takes the Judge Dredd movie made earlier and makes it look like a kid's movie.  The quality of the two doesn't even compare.  Dredd is a masterpiece of a movie IMO and will become what I like to say, \\"a comfort food video\\" because you can watch it over and over - if you have the taste for it.<br /><br />When it comes to landing the niche position in box offices, this could easily become a cult classic - or even better a series like other comic book movies - as THE most accurate portrayal of future crime available.  If there's no sequel, I'll be happy watching this DVD and buying a new 3D TV just to do so.  There are small details in this movie that scream quality!  I think the major problem in this movie taking a box office dive was the promotion.  If I would've known it was as good as it is, I would've went to it TWICE in theatres.<br /><br />So, down to the movie itself.  I think we all know who Dredd is about and what he does.  The best part about the movie are the nuances, the details, the vision and the quality they achieved in making it lifelike.  I could totally see everything in this movie happening in the future with no doubts.  At no time, did I say, \\"that wouldn't happen or it couldn't.\\"  I was captivated at the realism portrayed and the sheer brutality of the criminals Dredd takes down.  Also, needless to say, the graphics and Slow-Mo sequences were absolutely breathtaking.  I didn't expect this movie to make me a cult member of the Dreddies.  I've drank the juice now though...<br /><br />Here's a good example, from a bioengineer's point of view - the guy who makes medical products - I can already tell you that the Slow-Mo drug portrayed in this movie is spot on when it comes to future drug delivery trends.  It's one of many little ingenious details in this movie.<br /><br />So, I'll top it off with this: BUY THIS MOVIE TO SUPPORT THE MAKING OF A SEQUEL!  Because Dredd deserves to have a 2, 3, 4, and even 5 if they are the quality of this movie, and I'll make the commitment to buy them too when they come out.kes medical products - I can already tell you that the Slow-Mo drug portrayed in this movie is spot on when it comes to future drug delivery trends.

B004NSULHM|1.0|There comes a time in every artists' career when they run out of ideas. Similar to an athlete on our favorite team, it's difficult to believe that there may a limit to the talent of those we cheer on.  Radiohead had two incredible albums, and two good ones, but it appears as though they're done.  This album provides evidence that they can't come up with incredible and inventive songs anymore within the traditional song structure, and they've been moving in this direction in the last couple of albums (I write to those that respond that it's just one album.)  Kurt Cobain said, \\"Pro Tools and studio effects can enhance a song, and there's nothing wrong with using them for that, as long as you can play those same songs without the enhancement.\\"  Radiohead will get four stars from critics and fans alike, no matter what they do, but can anyone say that the songs on this album could be played without enhancement?  They're done.  They've overstayed.  It's time to move on.

B008AT71WI|5.0|One of the greatest movie musicals ever.  The songs are memorable, the voices of the Urchins and Rick and Ellen are amazing and you cannot beat Levi Stubbs as Audrey's voice.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My granddaughter loves coloring on this app works great for her she loves it and I would recommend it to anyone
B00B99QTM4|5.0|Watched this with our kids for the first time this year and it was as funny this time around as it was when we saw it when we were kids! Classic humor, well-acted - a fun, fun film!
B004P4S4NM|5.0|Had to have this one I love adele and had to have this for my collection would recommend it to anyone
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|im so addicted to this game .. i came across this a few days ago on my kindle and cant seem to put it down. its definitely worth the download!!!!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|An all around fun game that can become addicting! Plenty to do or something you can play when you wake up or before bed. A great game for anyone looking to waste a little time or a lot.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|good book very interesting<br /><br />just finished Proof of Heaven and enjoyed it. A new view of NDE from a personal and scientific concept.
B0094K35S6|5.0|Love this move!  I could watch this movie every day.  Special effects are awesome and just love the story line.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing solitaire. I like play it every day. A must-have if you love card games. And plus you can play against other people too.<br />Final word:<br />AWESOME
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Geez the ending was not expected at all! A greaaaaat book I'd recommend it to anyone! I love it so much!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This is not a book for the faint-hearted mystery reader.  It has an unusual story, an imperfect heroine, and a lot of twists and turns, all of which I have come to expect from Gillian Flynn.  I would love to get inside that head of hers----can't imagine where these characters and stories come from!  Sharp Objects is a page-turner that you will hate to put down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing. Now it's even better because of the world tour upgrades.it completes the game and gets you sinned in.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Good storyline, action, and special effects.  Had problem pausing so I was mistakenly charged TWICE.  Please credit for second charge.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Feeling a bit frustrated with people but know that actually hurting them is bad? Hop onto this game and destroy everything with germs. It's fun! Though I have yet to figure out how to successfully destroy everyone on normal mode. That's ok however. I have fun with every new game I try.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Can entertain me for hours! I downloaded this game for my daughter but I find myself playing it more than she does.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It's nice to just play a game! No back-story, useless graphics or levels. Just using your brain. Cool screen. Wish it would orient landscape.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Had to buy the episodes on Amazon as they weren't really offered anywhere for free (Netflix)...  Had no problem at all purchasing or watching them!Kind of sad that they weren't on the AMC website to watch...
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was a page turner...I had a hard time putting it down!! I am a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks though and love his books! I have already mentioned this book to some close friends.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Ok  our 5 year old loved it but this installment of MIB3 is not as kid friendly as the previous two.  The villain caused my 5 year old to jump a bit, but after sliding a little closer to mom, proceeded to watch the rest of the movie without a problem .  The opening and ending scenes might be a little too much for kids in the mid range..most of it flew right over the 5 y/o's head but If I were to suggest it to another parent probably 8-10 years old , depending on the kid , is a more appropriate age.
055357342X|2.0|I was thoroughly enthralled with Books 1 and 2 for all the reasons that all the positive reviewers state clearly - imaginative, rich plot, whole variety of types of characters each with their own motives,etc etc.  But in Book 3 I have reached an incredible level of frustration that key areas of the plot just do not seem to be moving forward.  If this is book 3 and there are theoretically going to be 7 books in total, do I have to go through another several thousand pages to reach resolution?  I am an avid reader and the volume of the books is not an issue, I just do not feel like I am rewarded for my efforts here.  I finally gave up mid way through Book 3 and then just read the wiki summaries online for the rest.<br /><br />this is one of the few books which would actually benefit from an \\"abridged\\" version.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm am absolutely in love with these fascinating yet very seductive books. Two thumbs up and I can't wait until movie comes out:)
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Great read! I would recommend to friends. In fact I have! Couldn't wait to read again and ind out what was going to happen next .
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|it needs word art for project z and stuff. but taxtix wise it is good i mean greatmre than great
B0099Y2YL6|3.0|I am in love with Downton Abbey I think like anybody else that have seen this show.  I just received Season 3 and cannot wait to see it, so I spent two days just watching the series.  I am only giving 3 stars to this item simply because I am devastated with Mattew dead at the end and no returning to the show. I think it is unfair for us the fans that he is not returning.  I know this show will not be the same for me from now on.  Actors should think a little more of their fans and how much it will affect them before making the decision of not returning to the show just because they want to do something else.  We get used to them and see them as an important part of the show and then they leave.  Why not wait until the series are completely done!  Sorry for been so negative but I am very disapointed.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|This is a great show!<br />My wife and I immediately watched the second season and cannot wait for the third to start.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A good way for horse lovers to pass the time while in waiting rooms etc.  Very good graphics. My daughter loves it too.
B009Y2KGSQ|5.0|Produced by genius producer read (Magical Ears!) Jack Douglas...this is a wonderful, killer return to form from the boys from Boston!!! Wonderful harmonies, (Tyler hasn't lost much, if anything!), Smokin' leads from Mr. Perry and the wonderful rhythm playing of Mr. Whitford...all tied up with a bow from Mr. Hamilton & Mr. JOEY Kramer!!!  KICKS ASS!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this is the best game on the kindle fire. I hope they get fun run soon.I also think that this game should have som free chaiters
B009T3AE1Y|5.0|Been waiting for this movie for so long. I love it and Robert is awesome in it. I recommend this movie to Robert Pattinson fans!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Everybody in the family loves it!<br />Fun game for all ages. We all have a kindle or tablet with this game.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This book was excellent!  We read it as a family and we all thought it was a funny story to read.
B00B7FWWNA|4.0|One of the most interesting subjects for a film, &#34;The Sessions,&#34; was a sensitive portrayal of one man's search for sexual fulfillment despite being severely disabled. John Hawkes and Helen Hunt were great as client and therapist, respectively.<br />If you are uncomfortable with the topic, you probably won't like the film, but it is worth a look anyway.
1933952806|5.0|This, in my personal opinion, is a tour de force in technical writing. It is clear, logically laid out, heavy on practical examples, and supported by a well designed index and table of contents. The author, the editor, and the book designer have my highest praise.<br /><br />I ordered this book after failing to understand some key concepts and features in the D7000, in particular its advanced, for me, auto focusing system. The Nikon manual, on line forums, and magazine articles just were not working for me and my photos were suffering.<br /><br />Although I bought this book just for its section on auto-focus I immediately realized that there was much much more to the camera that Darrel Young's book could help me with. There has been a dramatic improvement in the pictures I have taken with the D7000 since going through the book.<br /><br />Until I bought the D7000 I had been using a D90 and become quite used to pulling in superior images. But my experience with Young's book has made me order [[ASIN:1933952504 Mastering the Nikon D90]] because I am sure it will help me to build on that previous success.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I love his sound and every song was a winner in my book.  I was enthralled with him on American Idol and his first Album didn't dissappoint.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|My granddaughter and I have already watched it 3 times in less than a day! She is totally in love with it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Many choices in playing on the board. It can be fast paced. lt is possible to win.  A good passtime.

0307341550|5.0|This book had twists and turns and always kept me guessing! It was mysterious, shocking and it was hard to put down. I highly recommend it!
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Being from Detroit, I was predisposed to have a soft place in my heart for this work. This story wrapped  its arms around me and didn't let go till well after the closing credits. It's a Cinder-Fella tale on steroids. It's an unforgettable roller coaster ride from the slushy winter streets of Motown to the apartheid rioting crowds of South Africa. All this while telling of a search for a beloved Detroit strummer/songwriter/troubador who had gone underground - or possibly committed suicide - after a brief but impressive career in Detroit that left a two album legacy; and a story that must be seen to be believed. Rodriguez, if you read this, your music astounds me with its poetry and lyricality. And even more, you have a wise, old soul that had given much to the world within the depths of your music. Finally it is doing the work you meant for it to do. I am so proud that you are a Detroit home boy. Peace.
0307341577|5.0|This writer always keeps my interest. Her stories are dark, loaded with intrigue and always surprising.I highly recommend this book!
B00APUQRPC|3.0|The story line was very predictable. I love baseball movies but this was not one of them. If you have time to kill, then I suppose it passes for that.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun and addictive game. The only issue that I've encountered is sometimes the daily challenge clock stops working so I'm not able to take advantage of multiple consecutive daily challenge bonuses. Fun game!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was so good, but the death toll was just horrendous! It was the reason I put off reading the series for so long. I don't enjoy gory books. And massacre's aren't my thing.<br /><br />In general, the series was extremely well developed and written.
B00B7XGGTI|1.0|If this movie has been digitally re-mastered as is claimed then we are all in trouble. I allowed four minutes viewing time before shutting it down.<br /><br />Music and sound effects drown out the dialog, joined with harsh scratches in the images, skips and jumps in the dialogue and washed out color. The music seems to have been recorded on one of those old fashion stenography machines used in the nineteen fifties. The left hand portion of a sign, giving the name of the institution the actress is entering during the opening scene is completely blacked out, obscuring the first two letters on the left hand side of the institution's sign. Say goodbye to any foreshadowing the sign was to introduce.<br /><br />Dated cultural hick cupping aside, the technical work, or so-called remastering,is so poor that it constantly interrupts a viewer from enjoying any positive aspects of the feature. I don't know if this is a good classical movie or not as both visuals and sound are so bad that one can't make a fair judgment as to the movie's content.<br /><br />Scott and York would be unhappy with this if they saw this and probably would not allow it to be shown in its current condition.  The original cut has to be better then this so called re-mastered copy.<br /><br />I don't expect perfection in older movies and can overlook a lot, including dated movie techniques. To claim that this feature has been re-masterd is simply not true. The technical work is so bad, that it makes it impossible to view the feature as it was originally intended.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Thought the first one was better, but the whole series is extremely thought provoking.<br /><br />I put off reading the series for awhile because I don't enjoy gore, but the theme is very good, books were very well written and developed, characters were very different from each other and realistic, and I was kept on the edge of my seat wondering how Katniss was possibly gonna get out of each situation!
1419705849|4.0|What isn't there to love about the Diary of a Wimpy kid series. My children look forward to reading each one. We own them all. Sometimes I wish they would come out sooner, the wait can be horrible.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book and the series were extremely well written, creative, & very thought-provoking.<br /><br />Pretty gory killing off so many children, but I'm glad the hero/heroine conquered evil.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love these books. Cannot wait till book four comes out.  I tried to read this one slowly, knowing the next one is not out yet, but I couldn't put it down.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Love the way she grabs hold of her life with both hands.  She is all in with this hike.  It makes me want to add it to my bucket list!
B003MS0UHU|4.0|They are dinosaurs so not for timid toddler's but my 2 1/2 yr old thinks its great. Favorite characters all back
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The graphics are awesome! My daughter has enjoyed it so much and taught us to play it too!  Thanks for the fun
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|A few funny moments but relatively flat for the majority of the film. Not sure the f bomb was as necessary as they thought!
B0070Y46UY|1.0|OMG, I'm on chapter 16 and it is just droning on and on and on ........just not what I was expecting.
B0072OFM28|5.0|I am so addicted to this series. I hate that the present season is the last. The first and second seasons are great. You can't stop watching!
B000002AGN|5.0|I had purchased an LP version of this recording way back in the middle sixties when it had just come out and was very popular among my fellow college music students.  Somehow over the years and several moves, my LP seems to have disappeared, so I was quite pleased that I could still replace it and in a modern version.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|I can't get enough! Best series in a long time! The characters are so easy to get close to and the story line is addictive. You'll be glued to the screen!
B0017TYPIG|3.0|I guess they are preserving the original feel of the old-time classic but I would have expected at least some updated sound option like at least stereo.  Mono sound with a Blu-Ray?  Seems like blasphemy.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I gave this as a gift to my guitar playing son and he really likes it! Hugh Laurie is a fasinating man and I'm interested in the roles he takes and his hobby!
B004EI3ON4|5.0|You'll either love it or hate it.  I love it. Great mix of tech and classical that captures the mood of the entire movie.
0684824906|5.0|We are in the process of reading the book and it is excellent.  Doris Kearns Goodwin is an exceptional writer and it clearly shows in her lates book.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Love seeing the individual channel strengths to help me select the best transmit channel for my wifi network. Now if they can just make an app that will accept my model of modem and router and auto-fix all my setting to optimize the network I would be set.
1449415881|4.0|This item was given as a Christmas gift to my son.  I liked that it was a desk-top, day-to-day calendar that was also humorous. He says he likes it very much.
0765325950|4.0|I was only slightly surprised by the outcome. I think that the wait was way too long for what was produced. I was happy to see it concluded, Now I can go back and reread the series.
B0060AY85C|5.0|I love Toni Morrison and &#34;Home&#34; is right up there with so many of her other powerful books.  I appreciated the discussion questions at the end of the book.  Even going through the questions alone was thoroughly enjoyable.
0395389496|4.0|I love this book. Unfortunately. It showed up damaged. I live overseas and so I had it sent to my parent's house in the states, where we spent Chistmas, and so by the time I saw the damage, it was too late to return it.
B00068C7WA|5.0|As a fan from the UK and not born around the era Billy Joel started in the 70's this is a great introduction cd featuring the hits but not a full singles discography.<br />Known mostly here for the huge #1 'Uptown Girl' the cd was refreshing for the range and styles displayed and a good way to get listeners interested in his albums which I did after this highlights package. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Fun Fact: 'Uptown Girl' sold over 1 million copies in the UK and is by far his biggest seller (just under half of his overall UK singles sales alone) finishing the 19th biggest seller of the 1980's. The song hit #1 again when Irish boyband Westlife did a cover version in 2001, though this version didn't outsell Joel. The track is still common today at Weddings in the UK!<br /><br />Career album/singles sales in UK: 4.8 million/2.5 million = 7.3 million<br /><br />1.Tell Her About It: US#1,<br />2.Uptown Girl: UK#1, (over a million seller in the UK)<br />7.It's Still Rock And Roll To Me: US#1,<br />8.We Didn't Start The Fire: US#1.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|So happy i finally got to see the first episode! It was so funny...a must buy for any Big Bang Fan!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Amazon Prime is a wonderful way to catch up on Downto.n Abbey Episodes. I am up to date and ready to watch new episodes.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Although the storyline is silly at times, the movie was well put-together.  Great concept of smart super heros - much better than DC comic characters!  Couldn't have found a better cast!  Special-effects were believable.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am a very visual person & this provides lots of interesting pictures of different things. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for creative ideas.
B007XNAQLA|5.0|Have been listening to Chick since, the early days, (early 70's).  Had to buy this album with the &#34;Return to Forever&#34;.
B008602KQI|4.0|I was surprised how much I liked this movie. It had a good story and good acting.<br />I would recommend it to just about anyone.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|I love this collection! I don't really enjoy the packaging because sometimes the cds fall out but everything came in one piece and I appreciate how it was sent! So far all the cds are working well as well, I'm in the 4th season.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I was slightly worried about the quality because of the price.  I would have paid a lot more for this book.  It is by far one of my favorite sci-fi books I have read in a long time (and I've read a lot.)  It is very interesting how the protaganist goes about solving one problem after the other using math, physics, etc.  At times very funny as well.  It was very suspenseful at the end and I even had a couple tears at the conclusion.<br /><br />Seriously, this is excellent.  Don't let the price fool you.
B000QCS9NM|5.0|Will now read them all.  Vonnegut lives on through this guy...and he is insane.  It says i need more words.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I AM ADDICTED TO PINTEREST! I WOULD DEFINATLY RECOMEND THIS TO ANYONE. THIS IS A GREAT APP FOR THE KINDLE FIRE!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the storyline, but I loved the way the author wrote this novel. It kept me reading onwards with lush visuals. =)
B0086700CM|1.0|DIDN'T LIKE PLAYING IT ON THE KINDLE FIRE! HARD TO USE. GAVE UP PLAYING AFTER A FEW TRIES. MAYBE SOME ONE ELSE HAS BETTER LUCK!
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|At the end you feel like you should have seen it comming. It was a great story and it was a different out look on futer crime.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I LOVE PLAYING THIS GAME! IT IS EASY TO USE ON THE KINDLE FIRE! EASY TO USE ON THE KINDLE!
B007EECSFA|2.0|This book jumped around too much and it was hard to follow. It doesn't make me excited to read or hold my attention, I have really struggled to get through it. Maybe it is just me, but I would not recommend it
B009PNQUXO|5.0|I love having this on my kindle fire! It is great to watch videos on! Easy to navigatge thru! Must have.
1423101502|5.0|My teen daughter enjoys these kind of books.  They're interesting, and I think they're a good book for teen readers.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Just Incredible !!!<br /><br />I think the author just described in this book the dream of each teenage girl..<br />Described a strong , impulsive man (with his goods and bads) which can deeply love a woman..<br />I would like that this book to be read by guys too..<br />And learn something from it..<br />Learn to fight for their love..Learn to voice their feelings and listen to their heart..<br />Like Travis Did !!!<br /><br />I can't wait for the second book..
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|i love this show. have been watching it since day one. i own all episodes and can say that the quality of everything in this show (scripts, settings, acting, directing.....etc...) will not dissapoint in any way. i hope that, if they do end the series, that they do ten seasons. it will break my heart , but will understand, it can't last forever. this season has had some &#34;head scratching moments&#34;  and a few 'HUH'S&#34; but it is still wonderful and i miss bobby!!!!!!!!!
160774273X|5.0|This book is the best of all the contemporary bread books---if you want to bake today's artisan breads.  His methods so far, at least to me, are very accurate in timing and temperature.  Takes the guesswork out of this craft.
B00APUYN0I|1.0|Only watched this movie because a few friends assured me it was actually clever.  I will never take the advice of those friends again.<br /><br />The constant use of aca- (as in acapella) by much of the cast drove me nuts (&#34;aca-scuse me&#34; &#34;aca-politics&#34; &#34;aca-crush&#34;).  Aca-killmenowsoidon'thavetowatchthismovieanymore.  It just seemed like it was trying too hard to be funny.  This category of shock-jock humor by/for women is popular, but it either works or it doesn't.  Here, it didn't.<br /><br />The worst part of all of it was that the film demands that the audience root for the girls team (&#34;The Belles&#34;) even though they are consistently worse than the boys team (&#34;The Treble Makers&#34;).  The boys' team had more energy, better singers, better understanding of their audience, better set lists over all, and even a better name.  But because one guy on the boys' team was a jerk we're supposed to side with the less-talented, boring, out-of-touch girls group?  Even the girls' big number at the end that should have shown growth just fell flat.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Enjoyed very much can't wait for number three, have recommended the first two books to many. It is an example of what<br />Ken Follett does best.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is the first game of this kind that we have tried and it is funner than I thought it would be.  For the most part it seems that you earn and spend virtual money to take care of the horse so that makes me happy. (I usually don't try these games because they lure you into spending real money.)  However, it also uses gems and I haven't figured out how to get the needed gems without trying a sponsors link or spending real money.  Hate that.<br /><br />The kids have really enjoyed it so far and it is probably the closest thing to a real horse that they will get to experience in their lives.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|reminds me of a great classic that's been popular years past and will still be popular years to come and is just as fun
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was amazing. I can some how relate to this story through Katie. I didn't have an abusive husband, but I did feel similar about not being able to trust people and scared to get hurt. Sparks really out did himself with this one. I can't wait to see how this movie! Even though I know it won't be as good as the book.
1400096936|5.0|This is a very powerful book on the war on drugs spanning 30+ years. Although this book is fiction, if you were around in that era and kept up with current events you will recognize some of the people(names have been changed) and situations. This book is not for the feint of heart, its very brutal at some points and does not hold anything back. I would like to see it turned into movie but I think it would be better suited for an HBO mini-series. Overall a great book!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy wasting time playing this game, but sice it is free it has ads. Click the ad and you have a choice to see it or skip it... not really a big deal. If you have AVG, it wont keep running ads when you close it. Everyone should have an antivirus and firewall anyway. Good game overall!
B00005JG6Q|5.0|If you like anime, then you've likely seen this classic. But if not, then you should get it. This was the very first anime I ever watched, and I have been a fan ever since.<br /><br />I would rate this anime 4.5/5 stars for story, and 5.5/5 stars for visual (considering its vintage). Well worth the watch.
B008476HBM|5.0|Jane Austen cannot but become a favorite after reading Pride and Prejudice.  It may have taken 36 years to get to it, but I couldn't devour it fast enough once began.  I was amazed at how easily the personalities were painted in Elizabeth's language of each man.  You can't help but know each man exactly for who he is as Elizabeth does, not always timely but eventually the truth comes out.  Splendid storytelling.  Exceptional literature!
B0001VTPWM|5.0|There is nothing bad to say about these movies. Nothing. This series is the very pinnacle of its time. Special effects, plot, story, execution, all top of the charts for the era.<br /><br />Has anyone ever NOT seen this series? If you haven't, it is definitely worth the time. One of the best series ever made.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Once you start you can't stop and you will play it anywhere and it fun trying to be your friends scores. Love love this game.
B0001Z37HM|5.0|So what if the special effects are dated. So are Star Wars' special effects. The point is, this movie was amazing in its time. One of Arnie's first (I believe his second or third in the US), and an all-time classic.<br /><br />The story is alright. The characters are so-so. The acting downright sucks. But it has a charm that you can't deny.<br /><br />I grew up on this movie, and my son will too.
B0012ELLB0|5.0|If you like the Grateful Dead, enough said.  If not listen to a song named Ripple and I think you will enjoy it.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This is one of the best fantasy novels I've ever read, and just the beginning of an epic story. You will beg for more when you finish the book.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|I was hoping to see enough improvement over the old Arnold movie to make it worth it but it was just ok.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|Since you can't return it, it would be nice to know ahead of time it takes 72 MB to download!!!  Now I am stuck with an app that if I download it, my tablet will be really slow.  That sucks to no end!!!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Loved this booik. Read it right after Gone Girl by the same author.  Couldn't put it down. Very startling, crisp writing. Unflinching.  Fascinating mystery with a twist.  Highly recommend for people who like taut, gripping reads.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Another very intense and skillful game of 3 or more. Takes a lot of skill and concentration at the end of game.
B007BFSYMS|1.0|Not my cup of tea/coffee.  Pandora is better.  Waste of time.  Other apps I am sure are better.  This one is not.
B006QF61VA|3.0|had to do the ol' &#34;go back a minute to trick the streaming software into playing the rest of the movie&#34; a few times.
0525951652|5.0|I had been told about this book series, and although I don't normally read fiction, the trilogy idea appealed to me.  I throiughly enjoyed it, and am looking forward to the second volume.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|The movie was extremely entertaining. We even &#34;rewound&#34; several parts to watch them again.<br /><br />The streaming got stuck a few times. Seems to be more and more common with Amazon video on demand these days.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven is a great book. I felt as if I knew the characters. The ending was a big surprise!
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|If you like music you will want to watch this movie. Good for kids and adults too! The music is very good too. Got the CD also.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|This cd is a collection of all of her best hits, including her newest music out.  So I bought it for my daughter, and also stole it for my ipod lol.
B004QOB8SO|4.0|We saw a few episodes on PBS and enjoyed them so much we had to own the DVD. Will buy more.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|This movie really is completely adorable!  My daughter is obsessed with Matilda so she loved getting it for a Christmas gift!
B004132HZS|4.0|We saw a few episodes on PBS and enjoyed them so much we had to own the DVD. Will buy more.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|I bought this for my daughter who loves Tim Burton movies, she really enjoyed it!  I was happy that I got it for her.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the game is so fun and interesting my baby love it too. This game is interactive and fun
B003S897U0|1.0|this is a collection of cover songs, not what I was looking for at all.  I thought it would be the actual band singing the songs.....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So addicting! I love this game! A little  mad that I can't choose my own countries, or  go back to New York but the game is absolutely amazing
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Twisted and darkly sexy but not bad. But really how can two people be so clueless to their relationship sort of confusing.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|Tried to play it once-couldn't even get back to the game after turning off the music.  I uninstalled the game.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Brave was a cute animated movie, but in my mind it was lacking when compared to other animated films I've seen recently like Up or How to train your Dragon.  I was mesmerized by her curly red hair though.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very fun and time consuming. The graphics are never blurry and you always look for something new to buy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app has been insanely useful to me. I read on my kindle at school and I use this to do my work without lugging yet another device along with me at school. this app has all the operations I need and it has been very useful.
B005HSG3VK|1.0|I received the case and it was the wrong one, tried to return it and was told that they have no record of my purchase even though I sent all the info on the product. It will not even fit the original Kindle. I have the Kindle Fire HD 8.5. That is the case I need.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Team of Rivals by Doris Kerns Goodwin is a great book!  I loved it.  Just finished reading it the second time.
B004TI5N38|5.0|have read book before still keeps you wanting to read to the end zero day great book will read again
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|It's interesting, yet predictable. Good acting by all, yet the story is a bit over the top<br />Somewhat creative. But would have likes less predictability
