0316227706|5.0|I love this book, the pictures are fun and silly. They really capture the dogs personalities in a fresh and wonderful way. I love seeing happy dogs and this book is full of them. The images draw me back again and again.<br /><br />The quality of the photography is really top notch too.
B001FD5KJM|5.0|I LOVE this movie. The dialogue is snappy, the pace is appropriately fast, without feeling rushed. The actors totally sell their characters.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The title sums it up.  It's not an intellectual book but I think it is very important.  It paints a picture of the honor and dedication of the teams.  I suppose this book was controversial since clandestine operators should never talk about what they do.  That is how it should be but I think this event was an exception.  September Eleventh touched us all and we deserve an un-redacted and honest truth about the end of the man that hurt this country so deeply.  The wishi-washi-ness of the current administration and their attempt of an account (or cover-up) of actual events for this raid was unacceptable.  I'd trust a SEAL's word over a politician's any day.  That is all.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pintrest is one of my favorites! I get a lot of great and creative ideas from it. Its all visual, so it is easy to use.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is good keeps.my kids entertained. not to hard for them or I to understand and play good instructions in plain english
B005LAII8A|5.0|Looper is honestly one of the best-written films I've seen in a very long time.<br />It's creative, fresh, and a new look at the age-old idea of time travel.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|This is a great film to watch with the family, but maybe not small kids.  There are a couple graphic battles and images that might freak them out.  It is definitely a beautifully shot, well done film, but it is also pretty gritty.  Consider that before the 4 yr old sees someone get run through with a sword.
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|It took me a little while to get into the story.  It didn't flow very well.  It might be that I grew up watching the Wizard of Oz for years.  It was very gory to me.  It was ok.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Seems to be a good game, good for new Solitaire player like me.  There are ads, which is probably why the game is free, but I've never had more than one at the beginning of a game.  I would recommend it for what it is-decent game at decent price, if you're looking for something flashier or without ads you'll probably need to pay for it.
B000PMG16U|5.0|This movie is an excellent pack. Star Wars forever!!! I am a fan of Star Wars and i saw many many times ever film !
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I loved this book... i couldnt lay it down when i wasnt reading it i was thinking about what was going to happen next... best book ever
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Definitely worth the cost off the complete season.  This series has quite possibly the best acting and writing at this time.  Enjoy!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great game...enjoyed it very much...looking forward to the sequel.  I was able to play it over several days...good story line.
B008N2Z1L0|5.0|I really like this album. It's a typical Jakob Dylan album with strong lyrics and a smoldering voice. This makes a nice addition to my Wallflowers collection.
B0015AARJI|2.0|it arrived well ahead of the estimated date. my only gripe is that the analogs need to loosen up.. sssooo yea
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I was probably more excited for this film than any other I've ever seen (with the possible exception of its predecessor, the Dark Knight), and it did not disappoint. TDKR was a more-than-fitting conclusion to what is, in my opinion, one of the greatest film trilogies of all time.<br /><br />Performances were stellar across the board:<br /><br />- Christian Bale's portrayal of a grief-ridden/nigh-broken, yet genuinely heroic Bruce Wayne only further solidifies my view of him as the best Batman to ever grace the big screen. Those who take issue with his heavily gruff \\"Batman voice\\" will find no comfort in Rises (no surprise), but, as someone who embraces that aspect of Bale's spin on the character and appreciates his understanding of what Batman is ultimately about, I'm more than pleased with the Caped Crusader.<br /><br />- Tom Hardy was a brilliant Bane. Nolan did well not to follow the comics too closely with this character (TDKR's Bane is close enough to his comic book version to maintain adequate familiarity, but not ridiculously so). Furthermore, while I can understand the complaints about Bane's mask sometimes muffling his voice, I was highly, highly fascinated and entertained nearly every time he spoke. In that regard, I believe that Hardy made the character his own - turning in a performance that reflected enough of both our world AND the spirit of the comics to please a wide array of audiences. One thing I love to sense about a film's villain is a great presence, and that's something I felt each time Bane made an appearance. It's not the easiest thing to explain, but all of the villians in this trilogy had it. There was little-to-no wasted screen time with Scarecrow, Ra's Al Ghul, or the Joker in previous installments, and Bane is no exception here.<br /><br />- I was probably in the minority with Anne Hathaway; I expected her to do well. Even so, I was surprised by just how well she did. She captures Catwoman's ethical ambiguity and strong personality beautifully. Never does she seem overmatched or out of place in scenes alongside Bruce Wayne or Batman, and, like Hardy, she fits rather seamlessly into Nolan's film-world overall. Though the internal conflict she struggles with isn't something I haven't seen before with characters of her type, she expresses it in such a way to make it worth caring about. Great stuff.<br /><br />- Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt also leave their marks on the film in a very good way, albeit in smaller roles (or so it would seem). Gordon-Levitt especially shines as police officer John Blake, who's genuine desire to serve and protect is much like Commissioner Gordon's. Also like Gordon, Blake is a largely unheralded, yet courageously dedicated combatant in the raging battle between good and evil on Gotham's streets. Don't confuse goodness with cheesiness here though; the air of innocence surrounding Blake is as engaging as the corruption for which Gotham's finest is mostly known. Marion Cotillard (or Miranda Tate, as she's known in the movie) probably had the least to work with of any major player as it pertains to character development. Still, she was more than interesting enough to keep me wondering about her true role in the plot. Great twist involving her character.<br /><br />- Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman are all brilliant as usual. No more need be said about them.<br /><br />The performances above also contribute to some of the movie's best scenes. One in particular - Batman's first meeting with Bane and the developments which ensued - might be my favorite of the entire trilogy. Hardy was brilliant here at capturing that combination of genius and cold, calculating physicality which makes Bane one of Batman's deadliest enemies. Gordon-Levitt, Hathaway, Oldman and Caine also come to mind when I think of the movie's best moments. No need to narrow it down though; the Dark Knight Rises itself is a masterpiece.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|The Maze Runner has you guessing  from the very first page. To go into too much detail about the book would ruin the suspense and surprise which is half the fun, but here is a  brief summary. The story revolves around a boy named Thomas whose memory has been wiped clean. He is sent to a place called \\"The Glade\\" which is surrounded by stone walls and an endless maze. No one knows why they are there or who they are, only that they must keep on living and somehow solve the mystery of the maze. Everyone has their own questions and secrets, but the one thing they all share is the fear of being in the maze when darkness falls.<br /><br />Somewhat similar to the Hunger Games, the author creates a world where kids are thrown into unimaginable horrors, and must struggle to survive as well as face their own death and the death of their friends. On the other hand, the Maze Runner has more of a mystery quality to it, and the reader is as in the dark as the main characters who have lost their memory. As Thomas and his friends slowly put the pieces together, only then does the reader begin to solve the mystery of the maze.
B0052AC8C6|1.0|This was just a weird movie- not made for kids at all, and really too ridiculous for adults. Tweens might get a kick out of it, but regardless of who they were marketing this to, it's a lame movie that really isn't worth your time.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|I can genuinely say I enjoyed this movie. Kept me amused and interested throughout the whole thing. It is just the kind of movie I would watch whenever I'm in the mood to feel good and laugh a little.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|The Sons of Anarchy is the best series on TV. I have watched it from the beginning and it just gets better and better.  No it is not for children or the mentally challenged, but for the rest of us who really like a good and different story.  Even with all of the violence there is still the underlying sense of family love and commitment , odd as it is. Anyway I find it entertaining.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|A stupendous epic in the wonderfully researched and historically accurate style of Ken Follett. I never want his stories to end. This volume is unputdownable and totally draws the reader in so that you feel you are there. Highly recommended.
B0091REZMW|2.0|It's similar to the one on Facebook but smaller.  Your not able to do everything like on facebook.  If it had more rooms and other features it might be wanting to play it more.
B001G8XON0|5.0|This is such an awesome film...I went crazy over it when it came out and I have since suspected that Nicole Kidman won the Oscar of 2002 because Hollywood was repenting not giving Best Actress to her for this!  Everyone was in great voice and John Leguizamo deserves special mention.  As for the BLU-RAY version, the Roxanne sequence alone is worth the price!!! BUT, for true fans of MOULIN ROUGE!, hang on to your DVD copy, especially those who own the \\"Red Curtain\\" edition, since ther are many, many fantastic extras on that which ARE NOT on the Blu-Ray...Fans should have both!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I have to say I wasn't sure I would like this game. Then it sucked me in and I had such a hard time putting my kindle down. Can't wait for the next installment.
B008JFC6F0|5.0|I didn't think Kevin could make another album as good as Innerspeaker.<br /><br />The fact is that He's made a BETTER one.<br /><br />All we can hope is the the \\"mainstream\\" gets wind of his genius and pays/awards him accordingly.<br /><br />This is album is straight dope. Did anyone really expect differently?
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Its free and amazing... Addictive if I may. I love it. For a free app its more than worth your while.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A decent read and moving. I was the last one to read it in my family. They all liked the book, but I won't give it five stars.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|I have, as far as I know, every commercially available Diana Krall recording one can get. I pre-ordered this one in great anticipation. It's simply not very good. It's not a style she's very good at, we hear very little of her piano playing and almost none of that fabulous lyrical jazz phrasing that she's so good at.<br /><br />We played it once, my wife and I, and looked at each other after the first couple of tracks, with my wife being the one to say it first:<br /><br />\\"This isn't very good, is it?\\"<br /><br />Neither of us wanted to admit that we really didn't like, of all things, a Diana Krall recording!!!!! I suppose I'll give it another try in a few weeks, but I'm not looking forward to the experience.<br /><br />Diana: please go back to being a jazz pianist and jazz vocalist. There's so much left for you to do in that arena. You have nothing to prove by doing mediocre versions of other genres.<br /><br />WW
B009IKPOUO|5.0|Increíble que pudiera homogeneizar grabaciones de tan disímiles épocas y suene como si lo hubiera grabado todo ayer mismo y a la misma vez. El CD es maravilloso.[[ASIN:B00914JWSW Release Me]]
1476712042|1.0|Especially after having Amazon compare it to 50 Shades, it was hard to read this book.  The sex was horribly one-sided - zero foreplay, there's no way she got anything out of it - what a letdown.  And the character development was iffy.  Why should I care about a main character who encourages her boyfriend to beat up another guy at lunch at school, knowing from past history that he would really mess them up?  And there's an organized fight in a school basement that starts a fire where people are killed - everybody knows about it, but the police are too stupid to find and punish the fighters and organizers?  A painful read.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|All the best elements of an action read.  I would definitely  recommend  this for anyone  who wants true entertainment. Lee Child has knocked it out of the park!
B007HJ84ZK|1.0|The show is great, but don't stream from Amazon -- terrible. I bought one HD and one regular. The HD was quite good but the regular video was worse than bad; the picture was actually very blurry in many shots, especially the beautiful long shots. BTW, I stream videos all the time via my Roku through Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon and have NEVER seen such a bad quality picture. I'm sure the quality of the video is by design, to encourage viewers to get frustrated and buy the HD. I'll be watching the rest of the show on itunes... You've been warned.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|My friends cancelled their cable tv service for financial reasons after short sale of their home. This little cable had changed their lives. They enjoy Netflix thru their I phone on theTV so the whole family can watch together. Great idea!
B005IQZB14|4.0|Felt I was on the trail myself<br />I wish she would have spent a little more time on the end of this book, I got the impression she rushed to finish it<br />Awesome book tho
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Very nice controls. Allows user many options to customize layers of sound for relaxation. Easy to operate and gives more options for creating a truly personal sould experience than any other similar app I have tried.
0316228532|1.0|I was so excited to read this new book by JK Roeling!  BUT, it was a complete waste of time and money.  UGH!  What a disappointment!  I feel like she tricked me into purchasing a pornographic book.  Much of the language in books today is unnecessary, and I can often overlook that.  However, her pornographic and explicit language was totally offensive--I would NEVER have purchased the book had I known she was going in this direction.  I will never buy another book of hers--ever.  BIG MISTAKE, Ms. Rowlling!  Disgusting!  BTW, I did not even finish the book because it is THAT offensive!<br /><br />BTW, I only gave it the one star because I was required to give at least that.  She is a good writer, and can create a plot that draws you in...but the graphic nasty content is wrong, wrong, wrong!
B008XG1X18|5.0|my best idea's came from pinterest. Has lots of recipes tons of makeup ideas and so much more I love it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't usually do reviews. In fact I think this might be the first one I have done on amazon. That being said, there is a reason I am doing a review this time. The author, and the book series, is just that good.<br /><br />I was recommended this book by a complete stranger. I overheard someone talking about a sci-fi series that they came upon that was surprisingly good and relatively unknown. As someone constantly seeking out good sci-fi material I asked about it and then made a mental not to look into it. Soon after I found it on amazon, read the description, saw the 5 dollar kindle price tag, and went for it. I figured why not. I had never heard of the author at that point(or so I thought), but I always try to keep an open mind.<br /><br />I was not disappointed. The plot line was extremely well done. Even at points where I thought I knew exactly what was coming, I was usually surprised. From start to finish I read the series in about a day.<br /><br />(Minor spoiler ahead)<br />In many ways the author reminds me of a cross beyond George Martin(Game of Thrones series) and Suzanne Collins(Mockingjay). There is something special about an author that is willing to kill characters that they have spent time building up when it benefits the plot line.<br /><br />After I finished the 5 books I went onto amazon and found something else interesting. I had read a book by the very same author less than a month ago(I, Zombie). It was a very different book than this(although also rather apocalyptic, which is great), and also very well done.<br /><br />I am looking forward to any future books from this author, but with the same story line as Wool(the teasers at the end kind of sealed that), or with different themes.
B00121QGUY|3.0|Nuff said. It's kinda sappy at times, but a fun movie to watch. And every scene John Goodman is in definitely makes up for the sap.
B0049J0DC8|5.0|The movie itself:<br />This movie needs no introduction. It is a classic movie good for all ages. You are never too old to watch it.<br /><br />Playing the movie:<br />Playing the movie on instant play was unfortunately, not as flawless as I had hopped. I was in a car driving back from a road trip. I had a MiFi (gives an internet signal just like a phone hotspot except it is it's own device)but IO did not have that much data left. I thought I would buy it and download it to my Kindle Fire with the MiFi and then watch offline (which you can do with the KF). Unfortunately, this is not the case. You need an internet connection to get it started (first few minutes) even though I shouldn't have. I figured out why: Although it is downloaded to the device, you have to trick the computer into thinking you are on WiFi just because...why shouldn't Amazon make it more difficult for us?<br /><br />Even with this whole review about the playing experience, the product still gets 5/5 because this is an issue with AIV (Amazon Instant Video) and the movie remained great.
B005ERX1Z0|4.0|Loved this movie since i was a kid. Classic Burt, fast cars, hot 80s chicks, Sammy and Dean, Roger Moore pretending to be himself playing James Bond and so much more! And that's just the first 10 minutes.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day knocked this one straight out of the ballpark. I fell in love with Gideon & Eva in book one, and was kind of nervous about where their relationship would go. I shouldn't have been, though. The author stayed true to the intensity and maturity of book one while showing a more vulnerable side to all the characters involved. This book has a well developed storyline that kept my eyes glued to the page and oblivious to everything around me. I am going to have a hard time waiting for number three!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It is a well written book. I really enjoyed it. It could have been a bit longer on the details, but may have been cut short because of government rules.
B00008XEOI|5.0|who didn't know Lion King? and I love it specially my child. I have blu-ray edition but i think not good enought. because why dvd so look good in bonus than blu-ray. So i must buy it. i wait for longer time to get this edition. until i have this edition .. thanks amazon
B009G8GRX6|4.0|First impressions are a b###h to get right most times.  I messed mine up.  Originally I gave this album 3 stars in part because there are not really any songs on here that go KABOOM from the start, as with other Muse albums/songs.  Most of the songs on here are slow burners in my opinion.  The more time I gave to this album the more rewarding it became.  No, it's not a case of musical Stockholm Syndrome, there are some truly moving songs on this album. Plus I have an all-new respect for Muse's version of dub step in that they intended to make dub step sounds using actual instruments and not computers.  I give it 4 stars.  Sorry Muse, 5 stars is reserved for those great albums where I find every track just as good as the next.  Rare albums indeed.  The Bends and Jar of Flies come to mind as my typical 5 star-type albums, as well as several previous Muse albums.<br /><br />Songs I love:<br />-Madness (totally worth getting to the end of that song. Probably the most moving on the album, Bellamy's voice brings this song into a whole other realm by the end of the song)<br />-Follow Me: Best song on the album, another song you have to wait for to get paid off on though<br />-Liquid State:  The most rocking song, which compared to Muse's previous work, falls a little short in that category. But still a good song in its own right<br /><br />Songs I like (best to worst order):<br />Big Freeze<br />Unsustainable<br />Panic Station<br />Animals<br />Save Me<br />Explorers<br />Isolated System<br /><br />Songs I'm not fond of:<br />Supremecy: Doesn't really do much. Bellamy's voice almost brings me around by the end, but it isn't enough. Not a strong \\"first track\\" song IMO.<br />Survival: Has some good moments, but I find the cadence and chanting really annoying to get through it on a regular basis
B001GZPZG2|5.0|Iron Man so powerfull. i don't give you a big review for this. but i loved Iron Man specially Iron Man Mini Bust. I have mask edition and I am so glad have this edition too. why blu-ray don't have a nice edition like dvd.
0553573403|3.0|If you like a story that is heavy in description, then this book is for you!!!!! By reading this book, I've learn that I don't like books with heavy description. What i mean is a story that has half the page describing a guy standing on a cliff. It will describe how he is standing, the boots he has on, his belt, how his cloak flaps in the air every time he moves his mouth, his upper body armor, his eye brow, his hair, his ears, and how his arms are position at his side. Describing all of that would take about 1 page and a half or maybe 2 before it says then he rushes off to battle!<br /><br />The story is good though as long as you can get past the description. ITS NOT A PAGE TURNER! Sometimes when the events are in motion and your getting into it, a pop up description of something comes and bogs it down but its not as long. I really do enjoy the HBO tv Show but the book goes on to much in description and don't let me imagine. Its boring if everything is painted out for me. Thats why I give it a solid 3! as a its ok!
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is a lot of fun and addictive. I would recommend it to everyone. I don't know how people are against this game

B001EBV0OY|5.0|As video maker (microdac videos) and a person who love great movies, I can say without equivocation that this movie is one of the best that was ever made. I would recommend this movie to any adult with intelligence to appreciate the story and the art form. -microdac-

030758836X|5.0|I want to preface this review with the fact that I typically do not go for mystery or suspense novels.  I read this for my book club.  I have to say, though, that the book captivated me from the beginning and did not disappoint.  Even the end left me in a thoughtful trance that kept me asking, \\"would I have done the same?  Was there really a choice in the matter?\\" (you'll have to read the book to figure out why I ask).<br /><br />Without giving anything away, I found myself rooting for one character and then rooting for another.  I am not even sure there is a \\"bad\\" guy in the book because of the 3-dimensional viewpoint the author gives of each person.  The reader is given the chance to see deep inside most of the characters in the book, and there are enough twists and turns to keep you on your toes.<br /><br />This was a great read!  I have been trying to find a book that could keep me hooked from beginning to end, and this one did it.  Great read!  I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good mystery, interesting characters, captivating storyline and an unexpected ending.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Once again the 4 musketeers (plus Penny) have done a marvelous job of entertaining us for another season.  My family gets great pleasure watching this comedy series.
0307346617|5.0|World War Z is written from the perspective of a couple dozen survivors of \\"Global Zombie War\\" with the author acting as the interviewer. It assumes that the war lasted ten years and these interviews take place ten years after that. While the companion book, The Zombie Surivoval Guide, focuses on civilian survival; WWZ, like the title suggests, focuses largely on military, particularly as the story progresses. The various stories are interesting, terrifying, and oftentimes heartbreaking. Each individual story stands strong in its own right, with some focusing on discovering zombies and other focusing on large scale clashes between entire nations. It's this mix of macro and micro that really shows the devastating impact of the War.<br />World War Z is a fantastic novel that portrays a realistic depiction of how individuals and nations would react to a sudden pandemic of zombies. The stories are excellent and varied. Some are skewed toward horror, others are tales of unmitigated bada**, and others are close to being tearjerkers. By the end of reading this novel, your reaction may well be \\"I laughed! I cried! I immediately began preparing for global zombie war!\\" And isn't that the reaction we desire from a really good read?
B0088X7YU0|4.0|I enjoyed the movie - unfortunately, it's not my wife's kind of movie.  I guess it's a bit gorry for some women.
0718158113|5.0|Got this book after watching some of her series on Youtube.  I was instantly charmed.  Wanted to read more about Rachel and her food so I ordered the book.  I read it through and picked out her chicken with lavender and honey.  Sooooo delicious!  I couldnt stop eating it.... and the recipe was very easy as well.  Note: this book was the european edition, so all measurements are in metric.  I am used to this measuring system and have a scale and all of our liquid measuring cups have millileters on it as well, so I was fine with it.  But be prepared to measure in grams, not ounces and cups!
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|I'm not much of a baseball person, but I really enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />Brad Pitt has quite an interesting persona onscreen and couple that with Jonah Hill made for quite a show.<br /><br />I prefer non-fiction, so that was an added bonus with the history of this one, and something I hadn't heard about before this movie.<br /><br />Definitely entertaining, but not mind blowing.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game it is extremely entertaining l. I always have fun playing this game.<br />I can understand why people rate it five stars the only thing I don't like it the weight of the prizes
B006LSZECO|5.0|Every time I thought I knew just exactly where this plot was headed, it did a triple somersault.  Really enjoyed the book.  I found it suspenseful and difficult to put down.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Once I started watching the first disc I could not stop.  This season is very exciting and has quite a few surprises in it.  It does show a different side of Dexter.  I finished the sixth season in 3 days and that is not like me.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|This album became an instant favorite. If you like metal, rock, anything vaguely similar, definitely check it out. It combines hard rock with awesome lyrics and incredibly vocals. Lzzy Hale has a truly fantastic voice. The album flawlessly progresses through different kinds of songs. The anthem for outcasts \\"Freak Like Me\\" smoothly transitions into \\"Beautiful With You\\", an intensely passionate rock ballad. Overall, this is a fantastic album, and I'd strongly recommend it to anyone interested.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|I am not going to pick at this album song by song, as some do. Rock is supposed to be fun, not artistic perfection!!!! This album rocks and is a lot of fun to listen to! Also, i am sure KISS will be fun to see live, as they always are. If you like great Rock and Roll pick this up immediatley! KISS are back, live it and enjoy your life now! Long live KISS and Rock and Roll!!!
0385344333|4.0|I couldn't believe what I read with some of these reviews.  I was expecting to be disappointed, but I truly wasn't.  I love Jack Reacher, and I think Reacher did what Reacher does so well in this book as he has in all the other preceeding ones.  I liked the idea of the action taking place on the highways and biways in the prairie states-Kansas, Iowa, Arkansas.  I've always felt that a nighttime road trip thriller would be ideal-intimate but at the same time unexpected and scary.  That is what this book is.  I did feel the pace was a little slower than usual for the first part of the book, but that just enhanced the intimacy of this particular road trip.  The action does pick up though about half-way through and its a bit of a wild ride after that.  I particularly enjoyed the last few chapters when Reacher storms a stronghold all by himself.  And the book keeps you guessing as to who the good guys and the bad guys are all the way through.  Nothing is really like it seems.  And the ending is explosive and very satisfying for us die-hard Reacher fans.  So don't believe everything you read in reviews.  You need to read the book yourself and make your own assessments.  I'm glad I did.
0345803507|5.0|What an awesome book.  Highly recommend.  Only thing was that it came two days later than it was supposed to so I was waiting on pins and needles!!
B00746O3X8|4.0|I have another multi carrier harness that I like very much.  In the Summer, the vest type chest carrier is too hot.  I wanted an additional belt carrier for my second camera.  I decided to try the Opteka carrier system since it was cheaper than a second belt carrier from the other system. Through the Summer I used both belt carriers at the same time.  I was very well pleased with both and even with both and a water bottle pouch, I experienced much less strain on my body than using a single camera with a neck strap.  The major disadvantage of two belt carriers is that I nearly doubled my width. Last weekend was relatively cool, mid 30's morning with high in low fifties. I used the original chest carrier and the Opteka belt carrier.  The big advantage of using a chest carrier and one belt carrier is that the chest carriers have rings to snap the camera safety lines onto, in addition to requiring less space for my width.  I have a vest (originally a fishing vest) with lots of pockets for extra compact flash cards, batteries, lens cloths, note pad, pens, rain pouch, camera rain sleeve, etc. The vest also has two rings to which I attached the camera safety straps.  When I didn't wear the vest, I snapped the safety strap to a belt loop.  Even using a climber's clip the strap was a little short.  I need a safety strap about 3 inches longer, or maybe two clips for additional length.  I have had the original system for less than a year and the Opteka system for a little over two months. It remains to be seen how well the will hold up to use multiple days each week.
B0095R64AO|1.0|This movie was such a disappointment. I love all the actors, however, the movie could have been 45 minutes shorter than it was. Some funny parts but not enough to make up for the fact that it robbed me of 2 hours of my life. Don't waste your time. Just watch the trailer for the funny parts and that should be plenty.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I've read all the recent Navy Seal books and believe this is probably one of the more well written one's.  The book follows his career from start to finish and nothing I read caused me any concern about giving up tactical information to the enemy.  The fact is, the author simply provided a detailed account of what actually happened from his perspective on the ground vs. what we saw on the news channels a few weeks after Bin Ladin was taken out.<br /><br />Some may say the book shouldn't have been written, but I hope he benefits from it.  He set the record straight based on the leaks from our Government and what the media reported.  If the Pentagon is going to go after him, they should get in line and start with the leakers from the White House on down.<br /><br />Semper Fi Mr. Owen!
B000I9VON0|5.0|One of my childhood favorites... forgot what hacking was like without the internet.  One the black box - Do kids these days even know what answering machines are?  This is definitely a movie that you should have in your collection.  Great cast.  Great writing.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|How Mr.Child dreams up these different scenarios for Jack, I'll never know.  But they're always different, and this one is too (except similar openings and identical endings, of course).  But this really was a bit better than the last several -- they're all terrific however.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I love the fact the story was told from the five year olds perspective,<br />was able to clearly get the message across while keeping some humor in it and a less biased story. very much like Forest Gump.<br />Was one of the best books about overcoming adversity and life is what you make it.<br />would recommend to anyone who likes books that have some meaning.
B000W178XO|5.0|Though I have some of Mr. Cash's biggest hits, this one has them all.  I love the wear and tear in Johnny's voice and the stories he tells through his songs.  A must for anyone who likes Cash.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is very fun. you get prizes and bonus coins. just be sure they don't fall of the side. the best part is that if you run out of coins, they regenerate after a while
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I went to have dinner and drinks with 4 girlfriends and found I could not even join in the conversation at the table.  The reason?  I had not read Fifty Shades of Grey.  So, I just started book 3.  I will have to admit that I have enjoyed it.  Oh La La, Mr. Grey!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|well worth the couple of bucks I spent long, suspenseful, and not to difficult. always enjoy these types of games and this one is now among my favorites.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|The show was a great remake of show white with many different changes that I didn't mine. The effects of the movie were astounding. A little bloody but it was great!
B002VECM4K|2.0|I'm not the first person to point out that this movie doesn't have much of a plot (I'm being generous). It's a pity because the performances are first-rate (especially Mo'Nique). Also, there isn't a proper ending. If this is supposed to be a movie about overcoming adversity, then it has a funny way of going about it. And let's not mention the plot holes you could drive a truck through...
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Just the thing for my shades of grey with drawls now waiting on the third of the crossfire series hot
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have read all of Mr. Follett's books, I love the way he weaves the characters together and gives us a glimpse into the history of the time.  I felt as if I personally knew the characters in the book, he does such a great job of creating believable characters.  I would definitely recommend this book to a friend.  It's hard to put down!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I have read several books about high school kids,but i have never read one that goes into more detail about life. The Perks of being a Wallflower provides a different perspective on life, love, and friends. All throughout the book i questioned my life and the friends i have surrounded myself with. By the end of the book i \\"felt infinite\\" because of the amazing things that Charlie has said about life. This is an amazing book for all ages, this is definitely a must read.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Very witty & well-acted - a treat to watch unlike so many current movies. The scenery is beautiful; only problem is the background music is a bit intrusive at times.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Great case, sadly I have dropped my iPhone 4 many times and this has helped it survive.  Cost is good, I like the look of the cover and it is a good fit.  Very durable.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game! I like to play while I watch tv. It gives me something to do during commercials.
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl was a terrific read, well written and twisted throughout! I went from liking, loving and hating all of the characters, plots and subplots from page to page...
B000V8A31C|5.0|If you love the sound of outdoors and your a fan of classical, this one's for you.  Relive all the emotions of the movie from hearing the score.
6304698658|5.0|Excellent condition and fun movie
0316228532|5.0|It seems this book is one that people love, or they hate. The one star reviews for price isn't fair to the book or its author, nor are the reviews from people who didn't read it, or just a read bit of it.<br /><br />For everyone who insists this book has to have something in common with the Harry Potter books.  The Casual Vacancy is what would have happened to Harry had there not been magic and Hogwarts to save him.<br /><br />The Dursleys were self satisfied, self important, stingy, petty, little people who were overly concerned with appearances, and what the neighbors would say. In the Sorcerer's Stone; Petunia Dursley was described as a gossipy window watcher. Vernon was cruel to Harry. Remember how many times he locked Harry in his cupboard, and later in his bedroom without food? The memories Harry had...of being chased up a tree by Aunt Marge's dogs, and not let down until after midnight. The clothing the Dursleys made Harry wear; all of Dudley's castoffs that clearly did not fit, and Harry's glasses that were mended with tape. His body clearly showed the lack of food.  You would think that any concerned neighbor would have turned the Dursleys into social services, but in ten years no one at his school, or any of his neighbors took  the time or effort to look into Harry's situation. Clearly Harry was an abused and neglected child. The people at school, and the neighbors, were too wrapped up in their own petty concerns to take pity on a neglected orphaned boy. JK Rowling described a desperate living situation for Harry, and I took it as a scathing commentary on social injustices way back then. I think Ms Rowling has wanted to expose the underbelly of social injustice even before she wrote Harry Potter, but you can clearly see the seeds of The Casual Vacancy had been planted years ago!<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is a look at people in situations where they can't take care of themselves. Yes, addiction is awful, and ugly. What is does to the innocent children is uglier. The kids have no choice as to who they are born to. Since they have no functioning parent they are left with little choice. They do what they must do to survive, or they don't survive at all. Without help from people with better life circumstances the cycle of abuse and neglect will only perpetuate itself. The people with better circumstances seem to see these helpless little victims as a burden, or worse; somehow they deserve their lot in life. Without help how can they possibly get out?<br /><br /> The Casual Vacancy is a tough book to read, but I think an important one. It is a book that shines a light on how cruelly we human beings can be toward one another. How we can take pleasure tormenting each other, how many of us become so wrapped up in our own little dramas that we become blind to other's suffering, or choose to look away; how we prey upon those weaker than ourselves, and how when we do nothing the consequences can be devastating. I think that is the point of the book. We have to stop looking away.<br /><br />Something to think about; If Harry were a real boy, in the real world, living in the situation described, and showing the anger he did toward the Dursleys; how long would it be before sweet little 11 year old Harry became a snarling, out of control, rebellious teenager?  Given the complete lack of love from the Dursleys what might Harry do to them or to himself? If no one intervened on Harry's behalf there would be no telling.
1423140605|4.0|It wasn't the best of his books but you still will love it! i don't really like the fact that  Percy doesn't do much in this one and that him and Jason are bickering quite often. its hard to figure out if they are really friends. Also i have very mixed feelings for the ending.  if the rest of the books have the seven apart then i don't really know how that's gonna go for me.  i like it when all of them are together working together. But the book was still good and the next one hopfully will come around quickly.
1846076439|3.0|I purchased this book because I thought it was like a traditional Doctor Who paperback in that it was a short book that could be read quickly.  Did not know that \\"quick reads\\" means easy read for children.  I was a little disappointed at what I received for the price I paid.  Will not ever buy \\"quick reads\\" books again.
B009FOBMBI|5.0|I don't usually bother writing reviews for music that I purchase or anything I purchase actually. However, I had to for this album. I quickly listened to it when I first bought it and noticed that it wasn't exactly what I was used to coming from Three Days Grace. A couple days passed and I gave it another listen when I had more time and I can definitely see the hard work they have put into this. One thing I have absolutely enjoyed with this band is that I love all the songs and while I have favorites, I usually never skip a song. This is the case for this album too. All the new sounds with the songs and the very thought out lyrics just really make this just another great album by them. Don't listen to this just once. Take the time to really enjoy this before writing it off. Great album and looking forward to hearing more from them.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome!!!  its fun and I love it.. the only thing is its so hard to get some games unlocked cause some games are so hard..... I do love this game I always want to play

B0071BGOJC|1.0|The,first  of this trilogy was promising, this second  part is badly written and far too patronizing and simplistic .<br />Failed to live up,to,it's promise.
0060763280|5.0|I've read several books of this kind, but I read this book over and over. It stays on my night stand, and I don't read it all the time, but I go back to it from time to time.  I do believe the book \\"has my number\\", that is, it addresses what I need to do.<br /><br />I believe the information is good, valid, mostly down to earth and practical. The only problem, I'm still not a millionaire. I think it's somewhat like the best exercise equipment; it will work, if you use it, or the book will work, if you do what it says.  I'm still working on it...
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was probably my favorite book of the trilogy.  It started a little slow but when it gets going you can't put it down!!

B006IDDWL2|5.0|I just got the Requiem for a Dream Steelbook and I simply loved it, besides I didn't have to wait much time (eventhough it was an international delivery).<br /><br />As for the edition iself, it is beautiful and the movie is great, definetely one of my favorite Aroofsy's films.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Really crappy teenager y writing with no real content or story line. The main character feels 'ooh so this and ooh so that' for most part of the book ! If you are looking for a porn category book, by all means go for it. If you are looking for a good piece of writing don't waste your time and money !
B0071BGOJC|4.0|A great follow-up to Fall of Giants and loved hearing how the families continue to interlink and grow up... also some insights into aspects of the Second World War which were new to me.  Obviously much research has gone into this book which helps to keep it convincing and hold our attention.  A mammoth and entertaining book and I will definitely buy the final of the Trilogy when it is available.
B009A3IHJE|4.0|this enticing teaser really makes you crave the entire series! Anyone who has watched the other two \\"series\\" will DEFINITELY want to see Season 2

B0083SBMBM|5.0|I hadn't really liked the movies before it.  Hate the two hulk movies, didn't like either Iron Man movies.  I liked Thor, but didn't love it.  And Captain America just fizzeled after the first time he took off the shirt...<br /><br />But when I read that Joss Whedon wrote and directed it, I was on board totally.  but it was too late to see in theaters by then.  So I waited impatiently, bought the DVD, and...<br /><br />I've watched it at least twenty times by now.  There isn't a part I didn't love!

B0027MJU00|3.0|I Liked the author's very literal writing style...great for any reader who doesn't like to waste time trying to interpret what the author might mean. Very good character development. Great story line. But the ending. Oh the ending. Really? Our book club enjoyed making fun of that. But I would still recommend the book despite the throw away ending. Even if you are not into books about brutal family murders.
B0015346OM|5.0|A book I wish I had read a long time ago. One that is hard to put down, lost sleep not wanting to stop. Everyone should read so they know how much these men go through for us.
B0053O89WY|4.0|Not as good as Season 4, but still the funniest show on free TV. Jim Parson makes me laugh just looking at him. If you haven't seen the Big Bang Theroy you are missing out.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I wanted to like it but it was not there for me. The story was so chaotic - all over the place.  Eva has no respect for herself. Gideon treats her like crap but this is some how a total turn on and a dream come true in a mate. I get it that they were both emotionally, sexually and physically abused in the past and this is why they are so f***ed up. This is repeated constantly in the book just in case the reader forgot what they read in the previous chapter. I was disgusted with the way Gideon spoke with Eva, how dishonest he was and how sex spoke his unspoken love for Eva. I may read it again to see if that changes my mind because I did enjoy the first book in the series.  Honestly - I want my $9.99 back.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Really enjoy this game. Have it on my Kindle Fire and it works great. It hasn't froze up like some games really like it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I downloaded this game like a week and a half ago and I am addicted!!! I used to play a drawing game but my roommate took that over. haha. I love this game more and I love playing the real versions in bars and gas stations!!
B000SEHJGQ|3.0|Bukowski bounces between drunken brawls, disgusting descriptions of acne and boils and familia dysfunction,  altogether an enjoyable, but somewhat single-themed read.  I  prefer Vonnegut to Bukowski.
B003FHMHPQ|4.0|The content of the book is really interesting but also beautiful, which can be of great benefit for the Earth Angels.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Parts of this book were fun. Some of the sex, was well... sexy. but the book itself seems written by a fifteen year old. There is far too much sighing, and it continues throughout the book. I would figure once Ana started having awesome sex with this incredible guy, she might stop with the sighing, and the thoughts like \\"oh my\\". But no, these sophomoric behaviors continue. The book is occasionally fun, but at the end of the day I realized the sex was not enough to offset the boredom and tedium.
B008SVS3FC|4.0|John Hiatt continues to produce terrific albums. Most artists Hiatt's age are busy recreating past efforts. Not Hiatt--lately he seems to thrive on taking unexpected or unusual turns with each succeeding album (although I should note that they aren't radically different just unexpected creative turns executed with vigor and confidence). Hiatt has been hitting home runs with each of his albums over the last decade (he seems to have recovered well from the rather lame [[ASIN:B000002UJ6 Little Head]] recorded in the wake of the disasterous [[ASIN:B003A9EK5E Little Village]]album.<br /><br />Different people are attracted to Hiatt's music for different reasons-some prefer his heart felt ballads, some his scorching rockers while others prefer his humorous side. Hiatt is still thoughtful here but in a rocking mood most of the time on the latest.<br /><br />It seems like every album that Hiatt makes is a reaction to the one he just made in a good way--he tries something different for each succeeding album. \\"Mystic Pinball\\" finds Hiatt returning to a harder rocking blues based approach.<br /><br />This is a very good album although not as consistent as his last two, its still worthwhile  BUT I do wish that the CD was better mastered. It's not horrible but it does suffer from some issues with compression (which probably won't bother most people).
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Fascinating read! Really clever plot line, scary and thought-provoking. Didn't really explain the \\"mob mentality\\" portion of the story, not sure what the purpose of that was but added a creepiness to it.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I made sure my google calendar was up to date ... downloaded the app ... and immediately my calendar was on my Kindle Fire HD ... seamless. great screens ... unlike others can see by day/week/month .. with the words on the monthly calendar. love!!
B007FEFLTO|2.0|I can't explain the level of anticipation I had for this new book in the Century trilogy. I was literally counting down the days until released and bent over backward to make sure my Kindle downloaded it when I was on the road. Unfortunately, that was where the fun ended. This book is highly predictable and feels as though the author just went through the motions. I would say it's a tired story, and has changed my impression of the author for the worse. I've read almost every book Ken Follett has written and this was the first time I didn't feel like I had to finish it. If I hadn't been spending 9 hours a week on a plane, I may not have. I'm uncertain whether I will buy the last one, I may wait for a used book sale, and you can't imagine how disappointed that makes me feel.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|This app helps keep me organized.  I can keep track of work stuff, personal stuff and appointments for my Mom AND it syncs with Google calendar.  The only thing I've had an issue with is appointments in other time zones.  Fix this and it's definitely 5 stars!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game one of my favorite on my kindle fire my whole family plays with it myself but so far no compliant
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I am still trying to distinguish this from porn.  I guess they are calling it \\"mom\\" porn which seems to make it okay.  I found the sex monotonous.  I won't spend money to read the second and third books but may borrow them from a friend to see where the relationship goes.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a good app to pass the time with. some of the games are kidish. though overall its a good free app.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Rest stops will never look the same again.  As a matter of fact I think I've encountered a few of these gems in my travels
1439199388|5.0|This book is by far the best examination of the modern disease epidemics and the clues to their origins. The author has done extensive research of the new science of bio-depletion and autoimmunity and allergies. He also explores recent findings linking our loss of helminths and bacterial biodiversity to cancers and heart disease as well as autism and multiple sclerosis.<br />I too visited the small clinic in Tijuana a couple of months after the author. I vividly relived my trip in the pages of this book. Like the author, I benefited from my treatment with hookworm as well.<br />I believe this book will be a major force in the paradigm shift happening in modern medicine. Well done Mr. Velasquez-Manoff.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am hooked on this app; however, it keeps crashing so I have to force-close it.  Hopefully this will be fixed soon, but I will keep using it...sometimes I will switch to my desktop PC when it crashes and also to edit boards, settings, etc. as this app has limitations.  Love this though.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Never caught this one in the theaters, so I watched it after the third one.<br />It's great story telling by Nolan and I hope there is a boxed-set soon.
B0090EIILU|2.0|found this one to be rather predictable and boring. while there were some very funny parts it, it was just very lacking in the thought department.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. it. puts. all of my favorite things on one page. my favorite is the weight loss and pin up girl pins! this makes searching the web so much fun

B0086700CM|4.0|lots of fun lots of action. a game that both my kids and I can play without me worrying about it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Once again, Ken Follett pens a book of fiction with historical accuracy and characters that come to life.  His books leave me wanting more.  Already I am looking forward to the third book in the trilogy.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Price was great, and I got my purchase within 3 days even though I didn't expect it for a week
B0063IH60K|5.0|one of the best old school games. one of the few solitaire games that let you take the card back from your complete pile. also I can put my family's Pictures in the background and deck.
159420229X|5.0|The main reason I bought this particular book was because Bill Gates recommended it as one of his favorites books that he read this summer and I also (as a graduate student) am very interested in the concept of improving memory.  I read this book in one day because I was eager to learn more about the techniques he used to improve his memory; however, this book was more about his personal journey than about improving memory.  Although I was very disappointed in the second half of the book (because it didn't elaborate on memory techniques), I give this 5 stars because it has sparked an interest in a topic that I believe could change my life by improving my memory.  Don't buy this book if you want to improve your memory, but buy this book if you are interested in a story about someone who has improved their memory and you want to learn more about this concept.  This is a very good introductory book to spark interest but won't learn much how to improve your memory...you will just get teased.  I have now bought two more books to get more information on the topic...now just to find the time to read them. Enjoy.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved the book<br />I would recommend the book to friends <br />I love books like this.  don't take my wordead it
B00821OW8K|4.0|So I purchased this season based on the low price, and the description of the show.  I had never seen it or heard anything about it.  I don't even have cable.  So I was quite surprised when I discovered that the show was actually pretty good.  The acting is top notch, with Noah Wylie playing the main character.  You may remember him as Dr. Carter from the NBC show \\"ER\\", which ended a few years back.  The show has a nice blend of action and character development.<br /><br />One suggestion that I would have for the show's creators is that they need to show more emotion from the survivors.  These people have had their lives turned upside down.  They've had family captured or killed.  They're scared.  They're angry.  But so far I haven't seen that.  The people are acting like there was an earthquake and they're just waiting for FEMA to move in and rescue them.  I want to see more grieving parents.  I want to see more angry brothers.  I want to see some people with a chip on their shoulder.  I want to see some people panic from time to time!  There's so much more you can be doing with this show other than Humans vs. Aliens.<br /><br />Anyway, I recommend this show if you're a fan of survival shows or science fiction.  My hope is that Season 2 will include some of the things I have mentioned.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|The Forever Girl an utter wonder to read! Not into vampire books normally but this book is different. Nicely put together gripping plot. The wiccan angle and quirky main character make this the perfect read for me, but might be off putting to those who like standard reads. This book is extremely original in story structure and characters so it makes the perfect read for an adventurous reader like me.<br />I liked watching Sophia grow over the story. There were moments I felt scared, moments I laughed, moments that brought me to tears. I cried when I learned Ivory's past and I was angry and sad. There were a few steamy moments too and I was attracted to Charles. The relationship with him and Sophia developed slowly but didn't overwhelm the plot. Perfectly balanced and much better written than Twilight.<br />I liked the literary symbolism in the novel too, this is not a flat read, there is depth even though the novel is so mainstream. I recommend this one over the other vampire and witch books out there. Read the opening free chapters because if you fall in love with Sophia you will love this book!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is an awesome game but I think it needs armor. and pressure plates and stuff. the biggest thin I want is infinite world like on Pc.
B002APU580|5.0|Love it. Have watched over and over. Must read book. But movie is fantastic.  2005 version is the one to watch.  Darcy is sexy.
0316227706|5.0|I sent a copy of Underwater Dogs to my 87 year old father the other day. My mom told me on the phone that he sat grinning and laughing for a solid hour at their breakfast table -- \\"The smile never left his face,\\" she said. And then he got on the phone and told me, \\"This will never be put on the shelf. EVERYBODY should have a copy of this book!\\"<br /><br />I have one myself, and I couldn't agree more. Thanks for doing what you do, Seth!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|i love this game. ive just started playing but it reminds me of my childhood playing oregon trail in elementary school.
1469984202|5.0|Each of these short books could stand on their own.  I absolutely loved getting to know a set of characters in each book.  And even though the first book was quite short there was a lot of development in that time.  And then each book built off the previous without having to do any glaringly annoying recaps.  I also must say the writing was beautifully done and each book had an ending that made me think.  I definitely recommend it.
0316228532|1.0|Was unable to finish reading The Casual Vacancy. Just not the type of story I like to read. In looking back at the HP books I can see a hint of the style for this book in the Order of the Phoenix.<br /><br />Foul language and pornographic side tracks should be beneath Ms. Rowling. I hold her in higher regard than this misguided book has begained her. \\"Doing the right thing\\", \\"Being Responsible\\" were apparently Ms. Rowling's points in writing this story. I have no arguments with that.<br /><br />I would love to see this exceptional author follow in the foot steps of Agatha Christie with a good dash of Sir A.C. Doyle mixed in, not a vulgar Charles John Huffam Dickens. Please, Ma'am, a lighter touch on your next venture in tale spinning.

1741791529|4.0|Where does the bazaari take lunch? Where do the locals buy ice cream and rice cream (bastani and faludeh)? What's the best time of day to see the stained-glass windows at the mosque? These and thousands of other questions are reliably answered in the Lonely Planet Iran. The book opens up the country to the independent traveler and helps enormously in exploring Iran without tour groups or guides. It has good hints for visa extensions, means of transport, and I also liked the suggestions for hotels and restaurants. For these parts the book easily earns five stars, especially as the Bradt Guide, by comparison, disappoints thoroughly. But the Lonely Planets gathers weak points as well:<br /><br />The new 2012 graphic design in the introductory part looks more magazine-like, more colourful - and certainly less organized. The newly designed city maps are a desaster: Earlier Lonely Planet guides had city maps that gave you easy orientation in any city you arrived; the new maps remind of conductor paths drawn with a trembling hand; you can't even guess the exact location of hotels or sights. The map for Yazd is unusable, for instance, but other maps aren't much better. Nobody at the publisher ever considered the re-designed maps with a practical traveler's eye. I suggest using offline maps in your mobile phone or using the online maps service by Iranian mobile phone companies - and you'll never get lost again, not even when stumbling out of the Bazar-e Bozorg at a gate you've never seen before.<br /><br />Very unusual: Because of the Iranian currency's drastic decline, most prices in the country are considerably lower than quoted in the guide book. At least for Central Iran the authors describe public transport with high detail (\\" three blocks with the shared taxi, then three blocks walking in northern direction, then at the gas station...\\") - but if you earn your money outside of Iran, a privately chartered taxi \\"dar baste\\" is now almost as cheap as a shared taxi used to be.<br /><br />The \\"Farsi\\" language guide from the same publisher is a good, but not flawless, companion to the guide book.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />In May 2014, i went for another tourist trip to Iran, this time to other regions. I still had to use the 2012 LP, because an update is only planned for 2016 (but there will be a 2014 LP about Middle East including Iran).<br /><br />But even in 2014, the 2012 LP guide worked mostly very well, almost no entry was outdated. This time i also successfully used some LP maps (even though i loathe them in my main review above). Some hotels in NW-Iran do get way too much praise from LP though - best to avoid any high expectations.<br /><br />The previously abysmal Bradt guide has been updated in January 2014, so i took this book to Iran too. But still the Bradt has much less practical information than the LP (especially restaurant and hotel recommendations) and the long, academic paragraphs tired me. It wasn't very helpful for my journey.<br /><br />Curious: In NW-Iran, the LP shows a wrong phone number for a hotel, that's very rare. But when i called that phone number, i reached a perfectly anglophone Iranian who swiftly provided me with the correct number - it was some of the most efficient communication i'd had in Iran, and i didn't have to drink tea first.

B009HSVHV2|5.0|If you're a KISS fan or if you like good simple riff heavy rock, you should check it out.  It's more diverse than Sonic Boom but is a little less catchy.  It makes up for it with great riffs and muscle.  Gone are a good deal of Paul's \\"be all you can be\\" type lyrics in favor of more hedonistic and fun themes with the exception of the dark anthem \\"Freak.\\"  Tommy has stepped into his own much more than the last album and this time around isn't directly lifting Ace's licks.  Gene's songs are typical \\"love me or hate me, I am what I am\\" type fodder.  This album is heavier, darker, more diverse and somehow even more fun in places than Sonic Boom.<br />They didn't reinvent the wheel with this one, they didn't have to but it is a great ride.<br />Crank it!
1905113153|5.0|I could not wait until I received this book and when it did arrive I was not disapointed.  As a pastry art student I wanted a complete reference book, this is it.

B005GG0MIS|5.0|I am enjoying this book.  It is especially relevant at this time, leading up to a presidential election.  It provides an insight to the political process that has been going on forever.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I would highly recommend reading this book its intriguing and erotic but also romantic you can see how the characters fall in love with each other even though their begins are not conventional.
B00866H7SS|3.0|I enjoyed this book. I enjoyed it more than that other book that has so many tongues waggling (excuse the pun). The difference for me between the two books was that Bared to You has more body. There is a better story, it is told in a better narrative and the sex is less. Make no mistake, there IS sex. A lot of it. But it isn't the in-your-face-sex of the 50 Shades Trilogy and there is an element of reality that I personally appreciate. As a woman, a book comes along that creates expectations that makes me, as a woman, feel incompetent. 50 Shades was so far out of my frame of reference because there is very little between the pages that could be taken for real. Bared to You, and the sequel, provides that reality that brings my self-esteem back to almost normal - exactly where it should be if you're reading this type of book. We can't all be heroines, we can't all be beautiful, young, rich, etc. But we all have our bodies and Sylvia Day writes a better sex story. It is as simple as that. The characters are real. I love Cary. The storyline with the abuse in the background is something that is so very real and I appreciate her characters' journey to healing. It is not the best book I've ever read, but for my current fascination with this genre, I am more than happy. I am willing to promote this book to friends and I don't feel guilty/ashamed for doing so. I also enjoy other Sylvia Day books, for those who are interested in angels, vamps and werewolves...[[ASIN:B0057B8CB6 A Touch of Crimson: A Renegade Angels Novel]]
1444737112|5.0|Absolutely brilliant inspirational read which shows just how life can change for the better when opportunities present themselves.

B005IQZB14|3.0|I gave it 3 stars, because it was intersting and did allow me to examine some things in my life.<br /><br />This book contained some interesting facts about the PCT; however, it left me wanting more in writing content.  I found some passages to be deep and thought provoking and other times the writing style represented a person told to keep a journal with little regard to content.<br /><br />This book represented her journey in life and the PCT but did little to bring the two together at times.

B00908DDZM|5.0|Some artists put out that one CD, or that one song that just amaze you. Every song Macklemore puts out seems like a new classic, a new best. I sometimes wonder if he'll run out of inspiration or material and start recycling, but he continues to impress me more and more with each release, and his songs always seem like something new. This CD covers the whole spectrum, from his well known social-commentary songs that get written and talked about in newspapers and talk-radio, to the personal reflections, to fun, up-beat songs you want to dance to. Well worth the purchase.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have read all of Lee Child's Jack Reacher books and have greatly enjoyed most.  'Wanted Man', while reaching a satisfactory conclusion, loses its  way mid-book and tells  a formulaic story that, while mostly entertaining, is ultimately only moderately satisfying.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|The story line development was fine, but the portions of the plot were kind of hazy and devoid of adequate explanation. There were several sections where the descriptions of the surroundings were so excessively detailed and self-indulgent that I just had to skip because they were boring and pointless. Also, that whole communication system of counting letters is just so unrealistic for all practical purposes that it just deflated my enthusiasm for this book. It is well below average of a novel out of all other works by Lee Child.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|I preordered this blu-ray because I own the first two. The Dark Knight was a great movie, but this one failed to capture the excitement of the first one. It felt as though too much story was being forced into it, but none of them were explored enough to make it whole. I mean, Comm Gordon had a bit part basically even though he was s o integral to the first two. Bane was a mess. And there were better villians that could have been utilized. And when he took Gotham hostage, that was so totally unbelievable that it almost made me walk out. I mean, the US let that happen! Months passed! Totally ludicrous.
B005P39GOI|5.0|He has a voice that gives you chills!  I really enjoyed this entire album and recommended it to all my friends.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I could write 5000 words on this movie and still not scratch the surface of its plotlines. Just go out and buy/rent it and be prepared to question what you've thought about humanity's origins.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The book really kept my interest.  It contained Twist and turns that were surprising and unexpected.  You felt so caught up with the story and could imagin the pain the family was going through.
0553801503|2.0|Holy smokes, was this book boring.  In this non-page-turner, Martin seems more interested in indulging his fetish for turning a phrase -- phrase after phrase after phrase -- than in advancing the various plot-lines.  This was already a little bit true in #3 but it's especially true here.  I finished the tome mainly as a matter of principle.  But I've now officially soured on attempting #5 and am sorely tempted to let HBO filter any subsequent volumes for me.

B00354YA4U|5.0|I don't think I have read any Ian McEwan books and not enjoyed them. 'On Chesil Beach', however, captured me from the start, and held me throughout.<br />It is a wonderfully told story of just-married couple, and their insecurities and anxieties on their wedding night. McEwan is gentle and understanding with his characters, but clearly shows how unspoken issues will lead to frustrations and fractures in a relationship.<br />At first I thought the ending section just petered away, but on reflection I think that McEwan is showing us the distance between 'then' and 'now'.<br />'On Chesil Beach' is in turn humourous and sad, heart-warming and heart-wrenching. It is a fine read.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Monster continues KISS's streak of improving albums. 2009's \\"Sonic Boom\\" was an improvement over the majority of the music the band had released in the 1980's and 1990's, and \\"Monster\\" is an improvement over \\"Sonic Boom.\\"<br /><br />The album begins with two classic KISS songs, \\"Hell or Hallelujah\\" and \\"Wall of Sound,\\" the latter being one of the best songs to come out of the band in decades. Basically they stick to the formula that has always worked, as \\"Eat Your Heart Out\\" is structurally similar to \\"I Was Made for Loving You.\\" The last four tracks that end the album are very good, and as the sticker on the album says, there are no filler tracks or ballads this time around.<br /><br />KISS never does stray much from the formula, and as good as the album is, it does get repetitive after a while. But if the listener is in the mood for an album filled with in your face rock and roll anthems, then this will not let you down. It's amazing to see this band making an album this good this late into their career, especially when you consider the lineup changes and the poor quality of releases the band ad become accustomed to for quite some time. This is a triumphant rock album and a continuation of the solid, melodic classic rock vibe that made \\"Sonic Boom\\" so enjoyable a few years ago.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|The plot in Reflected in You was to drawn out.  I found myself struggling to read this book.   The events were too much but i still love the characters. I cannot wait to read how Sylvia Day will complete the trilogy.
B00846TTDG|5.0|This movie is good action! By that I mean it is believable and not Hollywood-ized (at least not like you would expect).  I found the storyline and delivery great and the re-creation of special forces tactics to be far above what you would normally expect.  The trailer sucks though so don't go by that!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Not sure I like how on and off again they are.   Its a bit much.   its just the right amount of steamy but some of the drama could be replaced with them enjoying each others company.

B0098VYKSA|3.0|The movie was decent, but not something I am going to watch again. The vampire girl's lack of acting annoyed me in this movie as much as it did in the vampire series. Other than that, the battle sequences were a little dry and the story was predictable all the way through.
B004V5QWU2|1.0|I don't know how anyone could fall asleep listening to these sounds. Many of the sounds are on such a short constant loop, you can hear them start and stop with an audible click several times in one minute. How can you shut down your brain if you just know that in a measured amount of time you are going to hear a click, rain will stop only to start up again in a few seconds. Maybe if these sound affects actually were \\"Natural\\" it would have helped.

1568363931|5.0|I am so excited to get this for my best friend.  She is an Army wife, and with her husband away and no children to look after, she says it can get mighty lonely - and sometimes gets lazy to cook for herself.  This is perfect as she doesn't have to feel like she is cooking one portion - she can make healthy meals and eat dinner and prepare her lunch every day so that she doesn't feel like she has to modify her portions and feel like she is \\"cooking for 1\\".  This book, with a set of Bento boxes, will be perfect.  Thanks!
0691143692|5.0|Judith Herrin wrote an informative history of the Byzantine Empire. She gave good detailed analysis of the origins of the Eastern Roman Empire. The Byzantine Empire lasted for almost a thousand years after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Herrin gave a solid explanation of the complicated Byzantine model of politics and trade networks. She explained why the empire reached lofty heights during the reign of Justinian.<br /><br />Herrin explained Byzantium's unique religious tradition and the military innovations like Greek fire. She explained why the empire began a long decline and explained how Constantinople held out for such a long time in the face of Muslim encroachment. She explained the role of the empire during the Crusades and the legacy of mistrust and bitterness in the face of the sack of Constantinople in 1204.<br /><br />Overall, the author did a terrific job of covering a long period of history in one volume. I enjoyed the book thoroughly and found the book to be concise and clearly communicated. This is a valuable resource on a subject often neglected in the curriculum of many colleges and universities.
B008G8SFGO|3.0|What I miss is the songwriting magic that brought us \\"Detroit Rock City\\", \\"I Stole Your Love\\" \\"Almost Human\\", \\"Charisma\\", \\"Wouldn't You like To Know Me\\" and \\"Live To Win\\". Those songs had lyrics that went somewhere, or a cool thought, or a courage to stand up and shout. They were cool songs. Since many albums ago, that has elevated KISS (in my eyes) to just being a cool band. Love the stage show, love the stories. I saw Ace a couple years ago and was thrilled. I'm a fan. But I'm a fan of the magic that leaps from the music, and I am LISTENING to these songs to see if they capture my ears. Apart from the fact that it's Paul and he can do things that nobody else can.<br /><br />At 4 minutes each, most of these songs just bored me. I hear the great production work and I love the band. But there's got to be something clever buried beneath or else it's just KISS playing chords. I'm gonna give this album three stars because I love KISS. I realize that Paul and gene are tired of the band headaches and I fear this may be their last album - but I hope they push forward. There's so much to love about KISS. Though maybe not so much to love in this album. It's professionally built, but it's not personally delivered.<br /><br />1. Hell Or Hallelujah - You can ALMOST sing \\"I Stole Your Love\\" to this riff. All the trademark KISS riffs buried within. Lead work right on schedule in the verses. Drum cymbals squashed by compression levels. Just a bunch of typical KISS riffs strung together.<br />2. Wall Of Sound - Typical Gene cliché lyrics. Good production (nods to Paul). Guitar tones perfect, of course. Chorus didn't hook me in with an endearing quality.<br />3. Freak - \\"Hey, Stoners, we're not rich 60 year old men. We're weirdos, like you, buy our records. Our official merchandise and meet and greet packages are clearly marketed to rich adults; but we're also freaks\\". Contrived. At least 2 members of this band don't use drugs or drink to excess. It's DOA, Paul. I don't mind when you sing about sex like you don't have an AARP card, but I don't buy these clichés, \\"Out on the streets, taking all the heat, dancing in the sheets, oh yeeeah\\".<br />4. Back to the Stone age - Standard KISS riffs but a lot of effort.  Riffs a lot like Psycho Circus album \\"You Wanted the Best\\". Chorus didn't hook me in with an endearing quality. Very formulaic KISS.<br />5. Shout Mercy - I like this one the most. It's got lead work all though it, an unpretentious pace and verses are long. This one works. I'll pretend like I don't hear the hand claps.<br />6. Long Way Down - Paul, Paul... love your voice, bro; but cut back on the compression. Mix is muddy because it's so harshly compressed. Typical Paul chords, riffs. Lots of vocal production but not much below the surface. Drums help a lot - creative and catchy. Still, the song is no \\"Cold Gin\\".<br />7. Eat Your Heart out - Cowbell, so you know they're overexerting. Wow, a lot of vocal production on Gene. Stupid, cliché lyrics. Yawn. Drummer doing his best to save this POS. Tommy blatantly ripping off Ace's licks. Guess he knows what the fans want and he's doing his best impression.<br />8. The Devil Is Me - lol. Gene is trying be edgy. Going out of our way to process his vocal so it doesn't sound like every other Gene song. Band is working hard to save this uninspired songwriting. It's been done before - more creatively when you were the God Of Thunder.<br />9. Outta this World - It's funny that they've given the lead vocal to Tommy. This sounds just like an Ace song. Slower, lamer; but you forgive Ace because he's your badass drunk clown. Is this really Tommy's best? It's even got an Ace message. Feels creepy. Either KISS thinks we don't care that he's doing an Ace impression in this song, or else his songwriting is quite below par, compared to Paul. Somebody's not trying very hard.<br />10. All For the Love of Rock and Roll - Exactly the same as my comments on song 9; except replace the word ACE with PETER and TOMMY with ERIC. Guys, seriously. this is insulting.<br />11. Take Me Down Below - First impression: Domino. Gene, you've got to have another trick up your sleeve. Chorus is just awful. Yeah, it's a rocker and it will play live, but I won't be singing it in the shower. A repetitive, one pun joke. This song length is 3 minutes longer than it should be.<br />12. Last Chance - \\"Do your dance on the edge of the night? A little obscure, Paul. This song sounds a lot like Paul's latest solo album. Doesn't pull me in on message - will probably work when I am running on the treadmill, but it's simply amazing production, polishing a blah song. \\"You want it, you need it, so get on the ride\\". Ok, that lyric was actually funny. Also the chanting part rips off AC/DC's \\"Thunderstruck\\" more than a little.
1451627297|5.0|There have been many, many 5 star reviews of this book, so I do not feel compelled to say much more.  --Except to say that if you (at some point) lost interest in Stephen King, give this one a read.  It will re-introduce you to everything about King's writing that had enraptured you in the past, but lost it's lustre in the present.<br /><br />One of the best books I've read in a long time, and is right up there in my top ten favorites of all time.
B0035LJY6C|5.0|I loved the Addams Family when it was first a television show. Not sure why I waited until now to see the movie. The casting was brilliant. Anjelica Huston is perfect as Morticia and Raul Julia is a red-hot Gomez Addams. The effects are great. Thing is just as I remembered and so is Cousin It. The music is also inspired. Hammer was not my first choice for the soundtrack, but once I heard the songs, I agree he did the update with style.<br /><br />So, what's the story? A cash-strapped Addams Family retainer wants to cash in on the gold doubloons in the family vault. What better way to do that than find Gomez's long-lost brother Fester and return him to the fold? Only the man isn't Fester....or is he?<br /><br />The plot had me laughing from beginning to end. This is the kind of story I remember from the original shows. The best thing about this film is that my non-horror fan husband can watch it with me without a problem.<br /><br />After I've seen the film on Prime, I'm buying it for my Halloween collection. Thanks, Amazon!<br /><br />Rebecca McFarland Kyle, October 2012
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|What a great book to movie.  Al the actors were wonderful and the movie very suspenseful, even though I knew how it ended!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The movie got me interested in the books.  The book is expectedly a little more detailed than the movie, but the movie is unexpectedly SO CLOSE to the book!  I can't wait for the other movies to come out.  My favorite book is the second one because it kept me wanting more so badly, but you will want to read all 3 of these little lovelies :)
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I throughly enjoyed thus book.  It was  an easy read and was hard to put down. You kept wanting to know what happened next. The characters were like friends you wanted to know how they were doing

B005HSG3TC|1.0|When I ordered the Kindle Paperwhite I also ordered the Folio Case.  However the case I received was for the Kindle Fire.  Not a very good fit. There is no way to secure the Kindle in the case while the case is open.  The Kindle just slides around in the case.  Also the picture of the case shows the Kindle being held on a slant for reading.  The slot is not deep enough to hold the Kindle on a slant.  The case came about a month before the Kindle since the Kindle did not ship until October.

B0053O89WY|5.0|After sagging somewhat in the 4th season the Big Bang Theory came back in the 5th. People forget that the characters have to move forward with their lives- and the inclusion of new female characters was actually a necessary part of this- but it did make the 4th season a riougher transition. In the 5th the series was able to refocus as the parts came together. And the final scene of the finale is a classic.

B0090EHVMC|4.0|My two 5 year old's didn't like the movie the first time they saw it because they said there were too many 'people in it.' I guess they wanted to see the Lorax immediately. My 8 year old and I loved the movie (I'm 44).  I would say that at first you don't really know what's the movie about and it takes a little time before you see where the plot is going. However, I think it's a great movie with a message that little kids can understand (even if there are too many people in it:)).
B009HSVHV2|5.0|KISS is back and in a big way. The band's 20th studio album, Monster, is a fun, melodic collection of top-notch rock songs. All of the band members (Paul, Gene, Tommy, and Eric) shine, and I'm glad each of them had the opportunity to sing lead vocals on at least one song. Speaking of which, both Tommy's song, \\"Outta This World,\\" and Eric's, \\"All for the Love of Rock & Roll,\\" are standout tracks. As expected, the album's filled with Tommy's memorable guitar riffs, Gene's signature bass, Paul's excellent lyrics, and Eric's masterful drumming. Nearly every song's a winner on this all killer, no filler release. If you're a KISS fan, pick this up and get ready to be rocked because the hottest band in the world is back.
B007KCG7MQ|4.0|Analog Man is definitely Joe's most engaging and consistent release since the early 80's. But I would have a very hard time buying into the \\"best work ever\\" or 5 star rating. I can't say this is an all-time classic that would warrant a 5 star rating.<br />I look back at  \\"So What\\", \\"You Can't Argue with a Sick Mind\\", \\"But Seriously Folks\\", \\"There Goes the Neighborhood\\", & \\"You Bought It - You Name It\\" and those releases have endured and continue to have legs to this day.<br /><br />I'll admit that I've been continuously disappointed by what Joe has released since the mid 80's.<br /><br />However, Analog Man has some terrific moments that bring a smile to this face. It's satisfying to finally hear Joe writing and playing to the level he is capable of.<br /><br />It sounds like Joe is enjoying himself and having some fun and the the majority of the tracks are filled with some heart and soul.<br />Things get off to a spirited start with the title track.<br /><br />\\"Wrecking Ball\\" & \\"Lucky that Way\\" have already grown on me and sunk themselves into my subconscious.<br />I also really love the frolicking \\"Hi-Roller baby\\".<br />I would have loved to have heard more tracks similar to \\"India\\" with vocals. What a prolific jam this track is.<br /><br />This release shows the promise that Joe is capable of and is far more consistent that Got Any Gum? Ordinary Average Guy, or Songs for a Dying Planet. All of these albums mentioned had their moments but Analog Man far outpaces them.<br /><br />I have no issues with the production of this album. I'm not sure what some listeners are expecting here?<br />This is a solid release in the cannon of Joe Walsh music.<br />It's definitely worth picking up and adding to your collection.<br />Welcome back Joe!
B0091TGWYE|3.0|Got the case, and while the iPhone 5 fits inside, it is not an iPhone 5 case -- in fact, its labeled a Samsung S3 case, and it has a hole cut in the back for the samsung's camera, not in the same place for the iPhone 5 so its just a hole. Nice suede, but I sent mine back and asked for a refund. There will be real iPHone 5 cases in the future. This is not what I want.
B007YQAYDG|5.0|Now that Michael Kiwanuka have already become the worldwide British music sensation in the wake of his highly lauded blockbuster debut album Home Again, I would like to remind the entire Amazon.com staff that the CD can be enjoyed even greater in it's deluxe edition.  I just checked with Wikipedia's website to check on Kiwanuka's debut blockbuster and found that it has a few bonus tracks (which makes it an even bigger hit clocking in at roughly 61 minutes), so we would like to suggest to Amazon.com and especially it's MP3 department to finally include this deluxe edition of Home Again by Michael Kiwanuka, which will be 100% music to the ears of his growing fans who do business or shop at Amazon.com.  Now that we have heard about this young dynamic singer-songwriter, as well as the top honours and rave reviews he recieved, we would like to wish him the best of luck, because he certainly deserves it, and we can expect to hear from this great aspiring music master for a very long time as a result of first-rate musical genius.  Count to think of it, I was looking forward to downloading this debut classic in the MP3 department but decided to check with Wikipedia and The All Music Guide for if a complete edition edition have been released this year, so that's why I have decided to write you this email letter.  Now let's give Amazon.com the suggestion to look in the deluxe edition of Michael Kiwanuka's Home Again in deluxe form so they can finally bring it in it's music department, especially the MP3 department.  Good luck on this quick search and thank you for your first class service.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I. love this game. it is the only Apo I have kept. live it! keeps me entertained. Fun and challenging without frustration.
0142428272|5.0|just a great book I cant wait for the next installments. I have yet to read a bad ken follett book or listen to one.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This was an awesome book.  It kept me up at night not wanting to quit.  It's a must read book if you like psychological thrillers.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I read a bunch of reviews about how good this book was, and the writing itself wasn't horrible.  But it was so far fetched about 1/2 way through I was simply annoyed.  But I paid for it so I decided to finish it even though I could have cared less how it ended.  Which was probably a blessing, because the ending was like a train of thought totally derailed and let you with nothing but more annoyance. If I could do it again, I'd spend my money elsewhere.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app has served me well. It works sort like an instant reminder I guess so u really should kno when exactly would b the right time too put ur kindle fire on the charger. Since u cant really kno that with the symbol 4 battery life at the top right corner. All devices are different with how much time uses u have on left when ur in the red. But knowing the percentage helps! (:
B003CSV7TK|5.0|We love this movie so much we actually watch it first of all of our Christmas movies.  In fact we usually start watching it in September to get us in the spirit.<br />Movie has some great one liners and we can pretty much recite most of it by heart.<br />The colorized version is okay, but we prefer the black and white because that's what we grew up with.  A must see every year.
0375507256|5.0|This is the second time I've read Cloud Atlas, so obviously I love the book--but not without reservations.  There are parts of the sextet that are better than others.  Personally, like so many others, I found the first chapter slow.  But more importantly, based upon the 1-6/6-1 construct of the novel, the book (and reader) end Cloud Atlas on the least impactful and engaging tale.  Bummer.  And yes, at times Mitchell seems to love to hear the sound of his own voice.  To that I say, so what? I'm sure Maria Callas did too.<br /><br />What I would like to do in this review is address the criticisms of people who find the book \\"pretentious\\" or \\"snobby\\".  It's fine if you don't like Cloud Atlas.  It's fine too if you hate it.  But I for one am sick of anti-intellectualism dressed up as egalitarianism.  People manage to be offended because somebody has IDEAS!  Cloud Atlas to the chagrin of this crowd has the unmitigated gall to consider human beings' betrayals and abusive relationships with each other.  It dares to notice that people are inhumane and cruel. That white folks did a great job of colonizing and exploiting the black and brown ones.  Sometimes in the name of Jesus Christ.  HOW SNOBBISH!<br /><br />Like Roberts' Supremes and Republican presidential nominees (corporations are people too my friend) there seems to be a groundswell of disdain for anyone who isn't elbowing their way onto the consumer/consumption-defines-me bandwagon.  BOOO to those pointing out that corporations have emphasized profit over safety and community.  HISSSSS to anyone who suggests that rampant capitalism serves the few, not the many.  Isn't life and the liberty to shop endlessly all any of us needs?  YAWN! Imagine thinking a book might change something...how naive.<br /><br />Again, if one thinks that Mitchell overstates or doesn't make his case, fine.  But to say that Mitchell is a snob for saying so, or (even worse) AN INTELLLECTUAL! is just inane.  The author follows a great tradition of the muckraker novel (Sinclair's The Jungle) and the Dystopian novel (Orwell's Animal Farm--can't tell the pigs from the people), and the Explorer/Exploiter tradition (Conrad's Heart of Darkness).  To infuse one book with so many genres and traditions is quite remarkable and a terrific accomplishment.<br /><br />If some of Mitchell's stories are more successful than others, that is hardly surprising.  What is really shocking is that social and political commentary in a novel is now considered pretentious and elitist. Challenging prose is a sure sign of arrogance. Barbara Cartland would be SO pleased.f the muckraker novel (Sinclair's The Jungle) and the Dystopian novel (Orwell's Animal Farm--can't tell the pigs from the people), and the Explorer/Exploiter tradition (Conrad's Heart of Darkness).

B001D0DQUC|5.0|Great movie for kids of all ages! I have always enjoyed this movie.  Anytime you are down this is the movie to pick your spirits back up.  It is a total \\"Seize the Day\\" type of movie.
1582701709|5.0|I was desperate.  I was responsible for the finance side of my spouse and my business.  Through sheer stupidity or poor oversight, I didn't follow up on huge amount of outstanding invoices from a year ago.  I was so scared to tell my spouse of my mistake.  I was stressed out for a month trying to get a courage to tell my hubby of my mistake and I had so much guilt.  Then, I was flipping thru Amazon Prime video and saw this Secret video (I had read the book about 2 years ago. I like it but over time forgot about it).  In my desperation, I saw the video this morning just to reduce my stress out of desperation/guilt/fear.  I started buying into it and started saying the mantra from the Genie \\"your wish is my command\\".  I got myself a bracelet as a reminder and started visualizing all the checks that I will start receiving when I open the mailbox.  This one big particular client was really hard to get hold off during the past month and I was really scared.  As the day wore on, I just started saying \\"your wish is my command\\" over and over again.  I had my doubts if it would work but since I was new to this, I excused it and kept saying the mantra.  Then in the afternoon, I decided to call the client.  I just got the voicemail of my contact person again. An idea popped out that maybe I can call another person I had a number for.  He told me he will email my contact and I heard a sad personal story about that person. I decided to email the person and offer my sympathy. I get a response and an apology and that the bills would be submitted for payments.  Then I get another number and that person says the bills will be processed ASAP.  I couldn't believe it!!!!  I am baffled as to how it works but it works. I consider myself somewhat in between idealist/cynic and it has been a constant battle of the mind between the two today. I can't say how it works but it did for me.  In the beginning, it's okay to doubt but when a mantra grabs you, keep repeating it to overcome your doubtand fear/guilt (in my case) and channel your energy.  I visualize the Genie as my \\"force\\" and the Genie telling me my mantra of my wish.  Good luck to the ones who are willing to give it a shot.  I was skeptical but after a month of stress, I was desperate and I couldn't<br />believe how this day turn around. So I had to write this review.
B005FHXB0O|5.0|Tarentino makes good films and this is one of them.  It's one of the best movies I've ever seen.  It's a little lighter than some of his, but has elements of suspense.  The movie is both hilarious and thrilling.  The love story is pretty cute and Patricia Arquette's character super likable as is Christian Slater's, who comes across as really dumb, but a guy with a good heart.  The scenes with the mob characters have great dialogue.  Christopher Walken and James Gandolfini are excellent.
B006UUK612|5.0|Was able to watch this classic with my kids and watch them enjoy this as much as I did when I was young.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Barbra Streisand really needs no introduction; she is a living legend and she continues to astonish me to this day! On this album Barbra sings beautifully and I agree that it all sounds like it was recorded yesterday. Terrific!<br /><br />\\"Being Good Isn't Good Enough\\" has Barbra in her natural element; and she does a superb job on this. Her excellent diction, perfect pitch, sophisticated phrasing and sense of timing all enhance her performance. \\"Didn't We\\" is incredible and the musical arrangement fits in perfectly with Barbra Streisand's vocals. She sings \\"Didn't We\\" with great passion and it's one of my favorites on this CD. \\"Willow Weep for Me\\" is quite well done; it's tough to believe that Barbra put this into her vault without releasing it! \\"Try to Win a Friend\\"  gets the royal treatment from Streisand; and listen for more excellent numbers like \\"I Think It's Going to Rain Today\\" which impresses me so much; the poignant \\"With One More Look at You\\" that was not used in \\"A Star Is Born;\\" \\"Lost in Wonderland;\\" the wonderful medley of \\"How Are Things in Glocca Morra\\" and \\"Heather On The Hill\\" from \\"Finian's Rainbow\\" and \\"Brigadoon;\\" \\"Mother and Child\\" that Barbra performs as effortlessly as if it were mere breathing; an excellent and memorable \\"If It's Meant to Be\\" and the last track \\"Home\\" from \\"The Wiz.\\"<br /><br />Barbra Streisand never ceases to amaze me; this CD is a must-have for her fans. It's wonderful that Barbra Streisand chose to share her gift with us and if we're lucky she'll continue to make contributions to the arts for many years to come. I highly recommend this album; and I hope that Barbra releases more from her vault soon!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is the BEST GAME EEEEVVVVEEEERRRR.I LOVE temple run it is the best game ever.I have played it everyday I have unlocked everything.
B000FBFN1U|3.0|At about this point in the series, I started to expect the betrayals and turns of fate that make up much of the plot of the series.  Since the plot is the thing that hooked me into the series to begin with, not the tone or language or morality, I started getting unhooked.  The details of dress and heraldry and food began to be less interesting.
B009AJD5E0|5.0|By far the best movie to come out since inception. It asks the most important questions of our time. an all-star cast with with a world class director delivers this modern day morality tale that will make a lasting impact on how you see the world.  A must see don't miss movie
0142501123|5.0|This is my grandaughter's, new favorite book. I found it on a list of good rhyming books for kids. It's nicely illustrated and the storyline is cute. Good halloween read.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Kiss is back with a 'monster' release.  Definitely better than Sonic Boom...Paul and Gene both sound great (much better than they do live these days).  Go pick it up - you will not be disappointed.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|i have every game by these people. I have bakery story, farm story, resturant story, pet shop story, and this is the best one.It is not dangerous for kids im only 11. i see the things that say to buy things i just say no.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Pornography in disguise. The sex scenes are too long and don't serve any purpose. More is not always better. But I guess sex sells cause the book has been selling well. Personally I found it a waste if money.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest everytime I log on it makes me feel so good there is so much to look at and learn about. I find the DIY info so interesting so many things I would not have found if not for this site and the art and far away places I just could on and on and on. Must see to enjoy :)
B0097S0TM0|5.0|I would strongly recommend the new P!nk album.  It is fantastic from start to finish, containing the heartfelt ballads (if u call them that) and the rollicking party tunes we have come to expect.  She does not disappoint.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This was a great Deal on a Great Movie. BluRay, DVD and Digital, along with 3D if I ever need it.  Fast Shipping and exactly as ordered.  Fantastic!
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Best show on TV. Never watched this during any of its running season. Just started watching recently starting with Season 1.<br />It is the most unpredictable show i've ever seen. I can't wait for the next episode. I'm hooked big time! Great show!!
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|I've waited along time to buy this because it was always like $20+. I'm glad I finally found it for cheap and not a used copy. Now I can enjoy A7X live in HD anytime I want.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Wonderful mindless hack n slash. Not much depth, but certainly helps kill time. Unless ur willing to drop actual dollars on this thing ur only getting half a game
B007SGM084|5.0|The 50 Shades trilogy was awesome. I couldn't put it down! Love it! Love it! Love it! I would definetly recommend it!!
B001TIQTFC|4.0|this is an unusual album but very satisfying for those with a mind to try it. quite harsh in many ways, yet appealing. the album is worth the price of admission purely for the title track
B0087HT36U|4.0|this has been a lot fun to play. It entertained me on a flight.<br />I like the characters and the scenery.
B00005LMLI|5.0|I reckon this is a great album. the 5.1. mix is great. there is only one thing that may distract anyone about this wonderful dvd-audio, and that is the transition from devil's food to black widow. the transition is not quite the same as the original vinyl, but devils food is the whole song, not half a song (as on the original album). If you like alice and you like 5.1, i think this is a must have. if you only like one or the other, it's a should have :)
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I saw Mumford and Sons on SNL a couple weeks back.  I immediately looked them up on Amazon and ordered the album.  It's awesome.  Can't wait to hear the next one.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I am a huge Lee Child fan, but A Wanted Man is a dud. It almost feels like Child was just going through he motions. We have all the obligatory Reacher characteristics but without the soul characterized by Childs' other Reacher novels. It's like he made a list of all the necessary ingredients and threw them into a pot without really thinking very much about the recipe. The result is a boring, flat storyline and characters who are caricatures of previous Reacher novels. I kept asking myself whether Child is simply bored with Reacher. If he is, he should take some time off because another one of these duds will be my last.
B009G3T01M|5.0|As a Seattle native, this album speaks to me on a level many cannot reach. That being said, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis (and all the people they incorporated into this album) are an incredible team and their message and passion soars through their music. I could listen to this album on repeat for days, and probably will.<br /><br />Macklemore is an artist who will blow up quickly and have the power to change lives in such a good way. His lyrics hit home and resonate with truth, faith, and hope, creating an album from beginning to end that wraps you up and spits you out feeling like you want to change the world. I'm pumped The Heist is finally out, and am so excited to see what Macklemore comes up with next! Also, props for staying independent and sticking true to his values!
B008602KQI|5.0|To me, the movie was about a sick society of corrupt rich people and oppressed working stiffs. You can feel the society fabric is going to fold by looking at its controlling class garishly overdress ill-fixing costumes, pancake makeup, die-jobs, manicured breads, wastefully and lavish meals verses the working class who wore the basic clothes, shoes, hair, people living hand to mouth, everything had a function and nothing wasted. I like the movie and I am going to read the book.
B00127RAJY|2.0|I was unfamiliar with Jillian Michaels and bought this DVD because of the good reviews.<br /><br />I am a beginner and consider myself in so-so shape for a senior, but in poor shape compared to anyone who normally uses exercise DVDs. Jillian says \\"no modifications\\" but I modified a lot of it. For example running in place with varied arm movements instead of jumping jacks, no hand weights, every other day instead of daily, etc.<br /><br />I needed to modify it even more, because the second time I did the DVD I pulled a muscle in my right arm and am waiting for the spasms to subside. The warm up is too fast, although I don't know how much that was a factor in my injury.<br /><br />I was planning to continue the DVD with more modifications until I read the negative reviews involving injuries, especially knees and back, from people who were in good shape. Now I don't think I will risk it. The DVD goes in the trash and I will use my older exercise videos.<br /><br />The good thing about the DVD - Jillian keeps you busy the entire 20 minutes and makes each move cover as many bases as possible. That's why it has two stars instead of one.<br /><br />Review revised Oct 16, 2012.
B001KZI2WW|5.0|I have two pairs now, the sand color and just got today the espresso color. Awesome shoes. They look great with shorts (no socks) and with jeans (with or without socks).<br /><br />They can be worn in the summer (no socks) and in the spring/fall (socks if cool enough). They are the most comfortable shoes you can own, and they really look trendy and relaxed. You could go out to a nice club in the summer with these on and nice jeans.<br /><br />I might buy a third pair in a different color before they go out of production. Great great great shoes!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|All my life from age 2 till about 25 years ago I have been an avid reader. Sadly a bachelors degree, and 3 graduate degrees and subsequently running a TV station limited my reading to textbooks and technical manuals. When I first purchased a Kindle, I had the opportunity to read again. Strictly for recreation. It still was not all I needed to feed my love of the written word. kindle for android fulfilled all my needs and then some. I now have it on my Galaxy SII, My Tablet, and my netbook. Along with this outstanding portability, it affords me the capability to pick up right where I left off in any book I was reading on any of my devices. I especially appreciate the way it sync's all my downloaded reading matter to all of my devices. Since it's installation, I have had the distinct pleasure of reading numerous books totally for my own pleasure, as, now I can continue where I stopped reading no matter where I am; where and when ever I have a few seconds to call my own. It's more refreshing than a coffee break.
B009HSVHV2|1.0|This album is like getting a visit from a senile old uncle who tells the same old stories except that he has forgotten the good bits!
B0091574VI|3.0|Chimpanzee is a most fascinating story about how one baby chimps' drive helped it to overcome very difficult \\"life obstacles\\"; however, I would recommend watching it with the sound off and captions-on since the sound score and narration is most horrible.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game is what it has always been.  There is alot of functionality so you may touch a three and it goes over to the ace pile, but if you need it for moving a two to one of your runs, you can move it back.  I hate the commercials in between each hand, but at least you can delete them quickly.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Fun game. Enough of a challenge to keep it interesting but not so much to make it frustrating. Bla bla
B00932AA5G|4.0|It is a really good comedy/thriller, it feels a little bit artificially constructed in the first 15-20 minutes but everything else is really good. In particular I like the logic in the sequence of events.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|so gooooooooood love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this game is fun I want to play this all day long overrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr :)  addictive game
B008WHQZJI|4.0|First 5 songs are outstanding....middle of the album is a bit weak....last song is good.  In spite of what I wrote here, this is still far better than most of the stuff being released today....pick it up and enjoy!
B002L9PQGG|5.0|Awesome vinyl with lots of tracks. Included some I didn't know before but love them all! Good value with 2 discs.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I have an Omega self winding watch from the 1950s which is a little too nice for an everyday watch but this Seiko makes a good casual everyday timepiece. Is accurate to a fault and not bad looking either. I recommend it. You cannot beat the price at Amazon.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This has really helped me study the word of God. I try to  study every night before bed. I love that you can switch to different versions also
B003VR5PPY|2.0|The story is all that this game has to it.  The tiny DS screen is just a horrible platform for a pixel hunt game.  Eventually made it to the end, but I felt like I was in someone else's story the whole way, and none of my few decisions I made mattered.  Biggest disappointment of any game on this system.  And to make it the end and get a bad \\"ending\\" just topped off the whole bad experience.  Maybe kids with little prior gaming experience like it?!?  Just search the web for escape game and you'll find much better games in this genre (and they are all free).  Awful game for an adult.
B002OMZTSU|3.0|this is hard for me....I am Brazilian and the<br />English spelling kills me. I love this guy and<br />I watch is show very often....The first chapters<br />was very interesting. I still haven't finish it.<br />I plan to....Now I am reading Flowertown and I<br />love it....Sorry if this isn't want you wanted<br />to hear from me....I love amazon.com and I adore<br />my Kindle..
B0084AXZK0|4.0|This proves again that old themes can make modern readers contemplate foibles of humanity.  This is not a read-it-and-forget-it novel.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A new world full of emotion, detail, and energy. A brutal reality show in a fictional book that leaves you wanting more.
B008XCM18Q|5.0|This moves at a fast action pace and is so different from the movie version.  The characters are believable and interesting.  But, sometimes , not often, Ludlam's detailed scenes become tiresome.
B004GBIE3Y|5.0|This movie was suggestted to me by a friend and I actually watched it with my daughter and we both enjoyed it very much, never heard of this movie before but it's worth a watch for sure!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|As always Lee Child/Jack Reacher do not disappoint. Some interesting twists in this one, very unexpected. Action and excitement guaranteed but will he ever get to Virginia?
B000VMBXNA|3.0|First of all, I love a good play on words, and the title is certainly that.<br />This novella is a fast read, and interesting enough that I can remember it after a few weeks, which is more than I can say for some books.<br />In a nutshell, the story is about how reading \\" common \\" authors changed the Queen of England.  The current queen. The real one.  I guess that's what I couldn't get past,  maybe I'm too much of a realist, but it was odd reading a fictional account about public figures who are still living.  The story by itself was cute,  in a \\"what-if\\" kind of way, but the Queen of England is a substantial living historical figure.  Reducing her to this novella persona felt very odd and trite.  It was like eating carob-coated bangers and mash -- It didn't mix up very well, and as a result, in my opinion, the story lost much of its sweetness.
B009AY04A8|1.0|I purchased this game because Hidden Object was not in the Product description.  Only hidden object.  I want my money back!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I bought this book in paperback when it first released, and immediately fell in love with the characters, and the story. I have sence decided to re-read them all, and decided to buy the kindle version.. Love Cassandra Clare, and the stories she writes :)
B008XG1X18|5.0|Thia application has so many benefits!  I can inspire myself and others to see the beauty that surrounds us. By utilizing one point and picture instead of insignificant chatter,  I get to the point of what really intrigues me.
1595826971|4.0|This book was good but my main gripe would be too much background art and not enough about the characters. The background art in this book was good, some great but some of the characters didn't even make it into the book! They had lots of things like random fish hanging on the walls but no Tweedle art and only two pictures of Mad Hatter concept art. I did like the different Alice dresses and concept art, I just wish they would have given more time to some of the others. I like to know the background of the characters and wish they would have give more time to that but over all I would recommend the book to Alice fans.
B002NWXRYY|5.0|I have a old VCR, off the TV, recording of this movie and took the opportunity to watch it again.  I seldom laugh at comedies but this one brought tears to my eyes laughing.  I enjoyed it so much that I ordered it on a DVD so I could show it to friends with descent quality. Some of the old movies are the best.  As always, AMAZON provided great service at the best price.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|so very helpful, I love it. lets me know when to recharge. while @ work. its a must have for my kindle.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book(s). I couldn't put the book(s) down, lost a lot of sleep and was caught on the job with my phone / kindle while I was SUPPOSE to be working....Now that's what I call a GREAT BOOK(S)!!!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|The book was still good enough I didn't want to stop reading and had some surprises too but I don't think it was his best. Still worth the price.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is worth your Money but not the same as minecraft for the Pc or the xbox.  it it really worth it
B004PGO25O|5.0|This book was just what I needed as I am embarking on my new project.  The author starts with an outline that highlights the obstacles and then methodically addresses them in a pragmatic and engaging manner.  I recommend it to project managers young and old!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a fast read and held my interest throughout.  I read this after having seen the film and my enjoyment was not lessened.  There are intrinsic differences in the novel and the film, both being enjoyable.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love romance books and this was absolutely amazing!<br />I can't wait ti ready the other 2(:<br />Can not wait!!
B007M6P01O|5.0|I love this series.  It's so much more than just zombies.  It's about how humans react to the most stressfull situations imaginable. For good or ill, it's a story about the human condition.
B009329Y30|1.0|I didnt like that movie is soo boring I love Zack Efron but I did not even learn his carácter name a total waste of time
B0091XRTTM|5.0|loved this one. characters were great, the story was original and fun and it wasn't overdone. oh, and my kids loved it too.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I read the first novel of this series, Fall of Giants, and almost done with this one. Ken Follett has done it again on consuming my all of my attention until I have finished every page! I am going to have a hard time waiting for book three! I am interested to hear of what this time may have been like for an indivdual. This book gives the perpective of many and how all of there lives are all connected, even if they are across the world from eachother. Even though this story is fiction, Ken bases everything from fact which makes what you are reading so believable and intense. Winter of the World is the next generation from the people you had come to love and hate in Fall of the Giants. People are still dealing with the affects of World War I and yet you feel like you are there watching the horrible downward spriral leading to World War II.<br /><br />I have to say that I wish people would stop rating books based off of the price and for the book itself. I hate to think people see the low stars and are pushed away from starting a great trilogy just because someone wants to whine about prices. Have you seen the size of these books! Trust me, worth every penny! If you love this trilogy you have to try his other books, especially \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"World Without End\\"! \\"Jack Daws & Hornet Flight\\" are two more favorites.
B008BGNMZU|4.0|When Fourplay comes out with a new CD (excluding the label's release of a \\"Best of...\\"), it's a Christmas-like event for me. I hear about it...I pre-order...then I can't wait to listen a few times to really sink my listening \\"teeth\\" into it.<br /><br />This particular CD definitely has a different vibe to it. It's not the \\"same 'ol, same 'ol\\" as others have posted, it's a different musical path with some recognizable Fourplay-isms (like songs endings) thrown in. I would say this different musical path is a reflection of Chuck Loeb now being in the band. Fourplay did something similiar when Larry Carlton replaced Lee Ritenour. For example, Track 1 seems like an old style jazz jam that lasts over 7 minutes long. I can't recall any Fourplay track ever going that long...and it was really cool.<br /><br />Anyone that enjoys jazz will enjoy the CD. My only complaint is Track 10; which doesn't seem to appear on the Amazon listing. It is a repeat of an earlier song on the CD \\"with\\" vocals. I love Fourplay tracks with vocals...in fact I have a playlist on my iPod called \\"FourVocals\\" (just Fourplay songs with vocals)...but this one seems out of place. I was wondering if someone slipped a \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" track in there...that's how different it seemed for me! Maybe some of you will enjoy it, but I skip it every time it comes up. I gave that track a couple listens and it did zero for me.<br /><br />Would I recommend you to buy it? Absolutely! This said, I felt the need to warn you about Track 10, so you didn't think something was wrong with your CD or MP3 player.
B008D19WBQ|1.0|When my wife found out about this she was really excited then I told her that it will be the edited for time/content versions that were broadcasted and then she picked up the money she threw at my computer monitor. Sorry but a high quality picture doesn't make up for the lost content.<br /><br />It still boggles the mind that companies continue to F' up Blu-Ray sets, this will be a repeat of the attack of the 1 Stars like the Star Wars set got. Congrats on joining the club in Blu-Ray set fails.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|I really enjoyed Bones Season 7 can't wait to see 8. I own the CD sets of season 1-6 and intend to purchase the Box Set of Season 7. Bones has always been one of my favorite shows although I have to admit episodes containging Gormagon,Grave Digger and Epps were my favorite.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app does what it says. There are many Bible versions available, in English and many many other languages. You can adjust settings easily...font size and background lighting.  It even has audio! There are many different devotional programs too. You can decide what you want to read and it will set up a schedule for you. The devotional programs include reading through the Bible (you set the pace), books of the Bible, topics (like what the Bible says about_______), and many devotionals written by various people. It is a great app. I love it and highly recommend it!  Thank you!!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This is a great read, especially if you are a bit of a history buff. The wonderful little details of  all the various people that appear are intriguing . The title catches your eye but the characters catch your heart.
B0062OCNAI|4.0|The unusual format of using the spirits of two critically injured women to tell the story adds intetest and excites the curiosity of the reader.<br /><br />The red herrings are very convincing.  The number of suspects in the multiple crimes sometimes causes the reader temporary confusion.<br /><br />I feel that the author showed the dynamics of the two mother/daughter relationsips, such as; the normalicy between Grace and Jenny versus the abusive,<br />intimidating, co-dependent connection between Massie and Rowena.<br /><br />I appreciate Lupton's use of the family's breath in Addie's armbands to demonstrate how love keeps him afloat. Grace's death was made real by her descriptive writing, such as, dark, heavy, mile of dense water, and vocal chords snapped off.<br /><br />She did a wonderful job of showing Grace and Michaels marriage even though they could not talk.  One sentence stood out - Our marriage was bigger than our differences.<br /><br />Our book discussion group also chose Lupton's Sisters to discuss.<br /><br />Rosamund Lupton is a gifted writer.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|The movie is O.K. I really like the book better.<br />The movie changed many parts of the book. O.K overall.
B009HSVHV2|5.0|Better than Sonic Boom. Not as good as Destroyer (As that even possible??). Has a great heavy sound. Definitely a keeper!
B008ASLK8A|5.0|It doesn't take a rocket scientists to enjoy this action packed film. The twists and turns add to suspense that will keep you wondering what is going on.
055358894X|5.0|Ok, I apologize for the bad pun/rhyme. But I don't understand the 3 and 4 star reviews. It's possible some people's expectations are a tad too high and I don't know why. (ugh more rhyming :) For example, there's the review which gives it 4 stars and compares it to Tolkien, Moorcock and Martin. SRSLY?<br /><br />This is the first book by the author and it's fabulous. The characters are good. The story is engrossing. It's got a fresh take on historical fiction/fantasy. There's no Deus ex Machina. While some of the plotlines are predictable, I am surprised many a time. The back story is pleasantly well fleshed out. The back and forth between flashback and present-day works exceedingly well.<br /><br />Was it perfect? No. But this is a first effort and I can't wait for more. Given some of the drivel gets 3 stars around here, anything less than 5 is an insult. I look forward to more from the author. And I highly recommend it for your reading pleasure.
B003V3FTTU|5.0|Had seen it before and knew it was a great movie. A coworker liked it also, so I ordered a DVD for me and a blueray for him.  Both came in when they were supposed to and in the condition the sellers said they were. Many thanks!
B006M7JCC2|4.0|I am fascinated by Anita's telling of her experience.<br /><br />She begins with a recounting of her upbringing and life history to set the stage and explain the events that preceded her being brought to the hospital in a coma and at the brink of death.<br /><br />Even though her life and mine have been very different, I can relate to the struggles she has experienced.  I believe many other readers will also relate.  We all have the same problems, they just play out differently for each of us.  The underlying issues are the same.<br /><br />There are many detractors of NDE's to be found - people will just believe what they want to believe.  I would love to hear the explanation from those detractors of what they think caused Anita's tumors to spontaneously shrink in a matter of days after her NDE when she had been fighting cancer for 4 years previously without success.<br /><br />I have read some reviews here that say Anita did not have a \\"true\\" NDE.  Seriously?  Are there rules for NDE's now?  Forget labels and read her tale.  I don't care what you label what happened, I call it a miraculous awakening.<br /><br />I am so very glad Anita has written her story for us.  The only reason I gave the book 4 stars is because there is a lot of repetition toward the end.  It feels as if the publisher had a word limit that Anita was required to produce and so the last 1/3 to 1/4 of the book is the same thing being said repeatedly - just the word order changed.  It is a little off putting.  (I have found this in several books lately - an unpleasant trend.  Just let the authors tell their tales, don't impose word quotas on them!)  Even still, the book is worth every dime!  If you feel the way I did at the end, just put the book down.  You will still be left with plenty to think about.
0618918248|5.0|This Book was worth the 13-14ish dollars i have paid for it, i recommend this book to anyone who are skeptical of their faith, Atheists, Agnostics or just people who want to see the Atheist's side of the argument.<br />The book may be kinda slow in some areas but the majority of the book is perfect and Mr. Dawkins' Wit and understanding of the world really flows into the book pretty well.<br /><br />Hate him or Love him, Richard Dawkins is my Hero and i hope more books of this quality appear in support of Atheism

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Mark took you on a journey from the beginning of his career as a Seal till his last.  He describes everything in detail. he made me feel like I was training with him I was tried from all the training. I was cramped in the plane on the way over and had a feeling of what the job entailed.  When the helicopter had a unexpected bad landing I felt them holding me back so I wouldn't fall out. i went inside with the killing boy was I tired when we got back to the states.

B008VBYN80|4.0|This is a great game to play in small increments due to the diamond and action points.  I like the game pretty much, removed one star due to the diamonds required for higher end gaming.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Excellent book.  If you liked the first of the series you will LOVE this one!  Historical fiction at its best!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I've been looking for a new author/series and a friend suggested the Jack Reacher series by Lee Child.  It took me less than two days to read this book.  I'm hooked and have already moved on to the second book in the series.  Good author though he does tend towards the verbose in detail.  I'm hoping that as the series progresses that he lighten up on the excessive detail but am otherwise looking forward to the series.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|AMAZING! A MUST GET! SERIOUSLY YOU MUST GET IT! OR YOU WILL FEEL GUILTY FOR THE RSET OF YOUR LIFE!

B001HNE3NO|4.0|This book was suggested by a friends and did not disappoint. It is well-written and keeps the reader engaged. It was a quick read. I would recommend.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|YOU WANTED THE BEST, YOU GOT THE BEST......This is the best KISS record since Revenge in 1992. Tommy and Eric do a great job. I know everybody wants Ace and Peter back, but then we would get another Psychco Circus and Monster is MUCH better than it was. Gene and Paul sound great. Definately worth buying.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|Easy reading flowed well. Not the political \\"spin\\" on the operation that came out of Washington from the White House and Pentagon.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Awesome extension to the story...can't wait for the conclusion!  Really can't wait to read it... Sylvia knows how to write a great story...
B007FEFLTO|4.0|The second part of the trilogy gives a fascinating description of the context of world war 2 - from an individual to a more global level. As a novel the drama follows a few individuals in central nations thus revealing some differences i national popular outlook as well as social class of various shape at the time. But of course, although historical insight is gained, the more grizzly aspects of the world wars are circumvented. As a story - a good read.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|I would have rated the film higher, sadly there is not a director's cut included with the new release.  I will hold off on buying this movie since a later release may include both versions of the film.  Similar to the Avatar dilemma.  Ridley swings for the fences and comes close to the goal of a great film.  If I went by the sets, F/X, make up, futuristic look, I would give it 5 stars.  Some of the fault lies in the first Alien release which was immense, tremendous in scope, perfect, and created a new genre-  Sci Fi Horror; unleashed on an unsuspecting audience.  The impact of Prometheus isn't quite there, like the Sigorney Weaver vehicle.  It is a good film, not a great film.  The theme is layered: man's search for meaning in the universe, are we alone, can we cheat death, what will a superior species/advanced species tell us of their world, will we ever meet our creators?  I saw the movie twice in the theaters and the second viewing added more to understanding Ridley Scott's canvas.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I have nothing but good things to say about this application.<br /><br />It works flawlessly with Ebay. It has never crashed. It makes browsing Ebay via my Kindle Fire an even better experience.<br /><br />And did it mention that its free!<br /><br />I love it.
B008I3QZKU|3.0|I am a big The Killers fan, but this album is not what i expectet. I had all his albums even Flamingo (Is great), Batleborn do not have one single song that make me feel conected. Still my favorite band.
B000067FP8|2.0|I was so excited to discover that there was a sequel to the classic Gremlins movie. I was disappointed in this movie, however. Stick with the original. Dont waste your money or time with this follow up.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's a hive game, but you have to be careful not to make an error when solving the puzzles.  .
B00005JOHC|3.0|I LOVE Two and a Half Men. Its one of my favorite TV shows and I highly recommend it. Based upon the TV show, I would give this one 5 stars (more if possible!).<br /><br />However, 2 out of the 4 DVDs in this set would not play properly. I wanted a replacement, but that option wasnt available due to supply issues. Due to the DVD issues, I'm giving this a 3/5 stars.
1476712042|4.0|Its the good girl with the not so 'good' past. Mixed in with the classic bad boy, who of course, has a heart of gold.<br /><br />I liked the twists in the first half of their story, the ups and downs, and how they were imperfect, severely flawed humans but somehow they fit and complimented one another. I have always been a sucker for the guy/girl best friends, guessing if there is more going on or not, so putting that in the mix was intriging.<br /><br />To me it was a little unbelieavable the lengths a proud one -night stander would go to for one woman. I liked how he was trying to fight his feelings but the lengths were extreme for me to believe even in a fiction setting.<br /><br />I also think the book should have ended way before the actual conclusion. Once they confessed their love and were together I was pretty much content with an ending. Of course her mysterious past was still yet to be revealed but that part of Abby's character really wasnt focused on much through out alot of the book so I had honestly forgot about it.<br /><br />Overall, the book was read within two days. I thoroughly enjoyed the read, it was entertainging, intense but light-hearted at the same time. I would definitely read again...and read more of this author's works.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest! I'm addicted and I have come across useful information and discovered craftiness I didn't know was in me! so much fun!

B00785P2QC|5.0|I LOVE virtual city, but after awhile it just closes on me. So that's the only thing I do not like. otherwise I love it. If the creators read this please try to fix it.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|The conclusion of season 3 was brilliant.As half the club was on its way to prison I was heartbroken and sweaty, I needed a shot of Pineys Petrone and a smoke to finish the season. It ended \\"all good\\",with 14 months at Stockton,bad guys dead and Jax well with his brothers. It was a long wait for season4 on DVD, as I had watched seasons 1-3 on Netflix with no interruption. The opening scene, the men walking out of prison,the music, the homecoming, you could feel it;The love and the sexual tension. Then, back to business. Jax is no longer a young man, but a MAN.Ready to take on all that comes his way,the guns,the Blow, the Cartel,Clay, Gemma and Tara. I love the honesty in which Jax proposes, \\"We should get married, I have loved you since I was 16\\",It was beautiful and heartfelt. Manly. This season with short hair, Jax is definitely a man.A bit heavier,more weathered, but those same soulful blue eyes to convince you that it will all be fine. But we all know better. When mulling drugs,selling guns, and making side deals with Clay, nothing can ever be fine. It was a gritty season, painful and bloody. And, if I could stop loving you(SOA), I would, but I can't.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|When the item was received, i noticed the piece to switch from ring to vibrate on the inside of the case was not attached, however, being my first \\"LifeProof\\" product, I went ahead and tested it and registered it under the actual LifeProof website (which accepted the serial numbers). Whenever I would receive a call, I had to open the charging port just so people could hear me (whether on speaker or not, and then the speaker for me to hear the person on the other line became extremely muffled. After looking up support and trying the different options to correct this issue, I took the case apart, and the camera lens protector fell off. I called LifeProof and was advised that this was a fraudulent case. LifeProof did, however, offer a 15% discount and free shipping, as they are trying to remedy the sales of fraudulent cases. Go straight to LifeProof.com to order your case!
B008FTAAG2|5.0|While I purchased this based off a limited knowledge of there songs (only listened to \\"gun show\\" and \\"blood\\" I relay was pleasantly surprised to hear how well crafted this album is.  It has alot more depth then you would normally expect and still rocks out when necessary!

B00992CF6W|5.0|Finally its out! I almost had a heart attack when I figured out minecraft was out ITS AWESOME CANT WAIT FOR UPDATES!
B002ZG999U|5.0|Like most of the previous reviewers of this DVD, I agree this copy is better than the screen version.  As a long time fan of action stars Stallone, Stattham, Li, Lundgren, Couture, Austin Crews, Rourke and Willis, this was a fun movie to watch.  Even big Arnold made a cameo appearance in this film.  If you are looking for deep philosophical meanings and romance in a film, forget it.  This movie is nothing but raw and exciting action with lots of laughs.<br /><br />I love seeing each of these action stars do their own little thing which makes this just the kind of action movie to watch more than once.  I am looking forward to seeing Expendables 2 on DVD when it comes out.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you are an action freak like most guys are, you will love this film.<br /><br />Rating:  5 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author: The Monadnock Defensive Tactics System)
034580404X|5.0|Great books, arrived safely :). Really satisfied with the product. It is a good and recommend to other to read it out.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|If you like sci-fi that makes you think, than this is it. I saw it twice in the theatres and still haven't grasped all the essence of the storyline. Just the pseudo-God storyline was enough to make me consider other realities past the societal dogma forced down my throat. This is definitely one to buy on DVD and watch a few times, if only to be able to slo-mo and pause it. Plus, the Alien angle was awesome also.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you liked Fifty Shades of Grey, you will definitely like Fifty Shades Darker as it is a continuation of the first book. Excellent sex scenes without being dirty and greatr descriptions of situations almost anyone would like to find themselves in.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Very erotic.  Could have been toned down a little.  If it's ever made into a movie, either they will have to tone it down or it will be XXX.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book really woke many women of middle America up big-time! Not many of us were ready for a reversal of Sex and the Single Girl or Feminism as we learned it!Submission is sexy?! What?  This \\" out of this world\\" gorgeous,sexy,powerful and extremely wealthy Lothario was busy knocking down the defenses of our heroine and we couldn't wait to turn the pages. Book one is done and Quick,run out and buy the second! And then the Third! Spellbinding.

0525952926|5.0|I just finished this book , and it was absolutely amazing. Ken Follett is truly at the top of his game on this novel.<br />The characters are well written and intense. It was a little hard to pick up at first from the first novel, with the characters, but after the first couple of chapters, it finally made sense to me.<br /> I would recommend re reading the first book , though so you can keep the continuity,

B007NG93CK|5.0|Right from page one this story reaches out and grabs the reader. It was impossible to put the book down until well into the night, when I just had to sleep, and dream about what had been in the book. A fantastic story with twists, turns, surprises and a big helping of horror. Brilliant stuff!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great love story. Enjoyed the storyline in that a single person can have such am impact on another to be able to completely change them without changing who they are.

B009CGYO0K|1.0|I have no doubt the book is funny. I've been reading The Oatmeal for a while.<br /><br />What is not stated anywhwere on The Oatmeal's page nor on Amazon's own site is that this book is Kindle-only. It will not load on the Kindle Reader I have on my iPad or iPhone. Adding insult to injury, if you pre-ordered it yesterday you woke up today to find the price $2 lower because Google Play has it for $7.99. And the Google Play version? Works fine on the iPad.<br /><br />I get Amazon's lending library being Kindle device-only. I'm very dismayed to find Amazon applying the same Kindle-only rules to purchases.<br /><br />[EDIT]<br />Amazon support was very helpful in both pointing out where the \\"for devices\\" field is (in small text to the right of the product picture) and how to return a Kindle book. They also appear to indicate that it's The Oatmeal that is restricting the platforms, not Amazon themselves.
B00846REIS|2.0|The novel was not well done ; charactors were weak and the story line wasn't strong. Fifty shades wana be which didn't make it.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|My family and I have always loved this movie! I been waiting to add it to our collection without breaking the budget. We recently got it and we still laugh throughout the film. The packaging, however, wasn't so great. First, it had no protection for the DVD from being broken or bent. Second, it took a solid 8 minutes to get the DVD case out of the packaging. I gave this 5 stars because I love the movie, but the packaging may be a hit and miss for some people. We were lucky the DVD was fine but that may not be the case for others.
0525953728|3.0|No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden is an interesting read, although the activity in the media at the time of launch may have over emphasised the confidentiality issue of the book. It is an easy, well written account of a Navy SEALs training and the eventual operation that saw the death of Osama Bin Laden or UBL as he is referred to in the book. I would recommend it, but don't expect any huge revelations on military training or specifics on confidential missions.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I'm a big fan of this series.  Got hooked on it about three years ago and have been reading them ever since.<br /><br />They aren't terribly distinguishable from one another.  Reacher wanders into trouble in one lost part of the country or another.  This one is no different.<br /><br />But the set up is strong and you're hooked from the get go.  I read it over the weekend.  Loved it.  Anxious for the next one.
0688014291|5.0|Even when the book is oriented to become an effective manager, the principles can be applied to every aspect of your life. It won't take you more than hour to read the book to cover to cover, but the principles will stay with you for a life time.

B000I9YWZ2|5.0|The actors are brilliant in their roles and the singing is fabulous.  This movie showcases Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix at their finest.  The movie is thoroughly entertaining.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|This was a good book and held my attention as the other Reacher novels have, but I missed Reacher's investigative work in this offering. I found The Killing Floor, Hope and Despair, and 61 Hours to be much more engaging and fulfilling of Reacher's full range of skills.
0375701427|5.0|I have read several of Roth's novels and this is among the best.  The story, well summarized in many reviews, is, in some ways, mundane.  But that is not a criticism, because the power of the book derives not from its story but rather from the author's insights surrounding that story.  The major societal developments of the period that the story covers -- roughly the mid-1940s through the mid-1970s -- are all in the book, understood through the eyes of the main character, Seymour \\"Swede\\" Levov, with penetrating observations by the story's narrator.  Through this frame, we see the origins of feminism and the civil right movement, the sexual revolution, the anti-war movement, the culture wars, the beginnings of globalization, etc.  This journey is really one of the transformation of American society from post-WW II to the upheavals of the late-1960s, from an idealized materialism to one in which traditional values and ideals were in the process of being re-imagined, but clearly not established.  Swede is thoroughly baffled by all of this, and the reader sympathizes with him.  The reader may not make the choices he makes, especially with the benefit of hindsight that we all have, but we do understand why he did what he did and, in my case at least, are wont judge him. The writing is superb, the story is compelling enough and the narrator's observations are thought provoking.
1449410243|5.0|If you haven't been to [...] you are not doing LIFE correctly.    I bought two...one for me and one for some random person I will ask on the street if they have heard of The Oatmeal and if they answer 'no' I will hand them this book because they obviously need to be slapped in the eyes with some sweet unadulterated goodness.
B004QO9ZVG|5.0|The book offers a very personal knowledge of Kurt as a man as well as a detective. It is the last in the series. After reading previous Wallander books, which I enjoyed too, I had to buy this one to find out how he was coping with aging as well as his work as a detective. It did not disappoint. It explains how he felt as his 'absences' became more frequent and therefore worrying. This is a serious issue which is treated realistically as well as dealing with the emotional results of being scared. The book also offers possibilities of how things were during the cold war, when nobody trusted anyone and no one from ordinary life had a clue about the inside workings of security bodies.<br /><br />I wish there were going to more 'Kurt' books.

B0090X4GJE|4.0|UK songstress Ellie Goulding burst onto  the music scene with her sparkly brand of electro pop. Since then she and Skrillex have become an item and besides adopting a similar haircut to his, they have also collaborated a bit. Her sophomore disc \\"Halcyon\\" features a more mature sound with more pensive and personal lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Don't Say A Word\\" opens the album with disembodied choir sounds and almost tribal percussion. \\"Anything Could Happen\\", \\"Only You\\", The swirling Dubstep-influenced \\"Figure 8\\", the shimmery club anthem \\"I Need Your Love\\" which features Calvin Harris, and the US no. 2 hit \\"Lights\\" are all upbeat numbers.<br /><br />This time around, the album is laden with ballads laden with choral walls, from \\"My Blood\\", the acoustic \\"Halcyon\\", the spare \\"Joy\\" (which allows her voice to soar unhindered), the lovely \\"Hanging On\\", \\"Explosions\\", the delicate piano ballad \\"I Know You Care\\" (which sounds like it dropped from Adele's handbag), \\"Atlantis\\", and the phenomenal \\"Dead In The Water\\", a gentle number that builds and builds, as does the album.
B0001VV1GK|3.0|This toy does get played with on a regular basis, and the elevator is a favorite, although I had to fix the elevator string after a few months play. However, it is not easy to put together (need basic tools and about an hour plus patience that there are so many pieces to deal with) and the roads connecting the platforms do not stay put with higher energy play (although the children seem just fine with taking them on and off.) I find that our plastic version of this type of toy gets played with more and is more durable (and holds up to dirt and water damage better.)<br />Upshot: I got this on a stellar Christmas time deal for less than $30, which was an okay price, but would focus on buying a sturdier plastic version knowing what I know now.
B0041T52S6|3.0|The film itself is great, perfect hybrid between movie and video game.<br /><br />The case, however, was of substandar quality and very dissapointing. It is really thin, making it easily bendable to the point it might fail to protect the dvd inside should something unforseen happen. The cover art protection paper/plastic is poorly cut and pasted.<br /><br />The extra contents in the dvd are quite good. It has a lot of deleted scenes, a few alternative ones and even an alternative ending, plus all that is listed in the product's description.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Well done and very entertaining. Good acting and great action levels. Congratulations to them for keping it tastefull not overdoing gory violence scenes.
0425263908|4.0|The opening chapters were so similar to Fifty Shades of Grey that I had misgivings about liking this book. Thankfully, I was wrong. Yes, the chartacters are all filthy rich and beautiful, yet they felt real and likable. Plus, there's enough depressing reality around so I enjoyed being enraptured in the glamourous and volatile world of Eva & Gideon. The book delivers on passion, sensuality, sexual tension and the emotional drama sometimes involved in meeting someone new. I found it a sassy and provocative read, which was well written. If you're curious about the current trend in reading erotica, this would be a good book to start with.

B00914JWSW|3.0|I always enjoy hearing what great vocalist have done that is unearthed. Sorry to say the music on this album is technically sound,and has it's moments,but does not embody great presence or singing. When you compare this music to the Broadway album it sinks like a stone to the bottom of the pond. I found that the project sounds half cooked. The voice is somewhat out of sync with the times that these songs represent. Sometimes the over singing reminds me of the later girl singers that fell into that trap(Mariah,Xtina). This is the Streisand that misses occasionally. I Remember Cher doing \\"Didn't we\\" on her solo show years ago-and though she sang it with less perfectionist technique -she nailed it honestly-Streisand missed it,and should have stored it in the vault with a few others. This was probably released in time to make some cash with her pricey Brooklyn concerts. This album is too precious and not very challenging.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|I was a bit disappointed that the DVD extras didn't include the cool videos used to promote the film.  The extended/deleted scenes were nice, but I really expected things like the \\"David\\" video to be included.<br /><br />The film itself was a bit of a disappointment - I'd already heard mixed reactions to the theatrical release, so the even higher expectations I had prior to the release were already tempered.

1451683405|2.0|Harris grounds his argument in the scientific understanding that we are biological creatures, and that our behaviors --even our conscious deliberations - are therefore determined by emergence from unconscious biological processes. He states: \\"Unconscious neural events determine our thoughts and actions - and are themselves determined by prior causes of which we are subjectively unaware.\\"  To have free will, states Harris, \\"you would need to be aware of all the factors that determine your thoughts and actions, and you would need to have control over those factors.\\"  That leads to a situation of infinite regress of influences.  Therefore, free will is an illusion.<br /><br />The first two sentences above are probably acceptable to most scientific philosophers, if not to religious philosophers or other die-hard dualists.  His conclusion about free will, however, is tautological.  Without saying he is doing so, Harris tacitly posits dualism as a necessary basis of free will.  But science shows us that dualism is false.  Therefore, free will does not exist. Q.E.D.<br /><br />I feel rather conned, as I had expected better from someone as eminent as Harris.  Even $4 for the Kindle edition seems excessive for a poor tautology.  To his credit, Harris did include a succinct and, as I read it, accurate description of the counter-argument put forth by fellow atheist philosopher Dan Dennett, in his own book on the subject [[ASIN:0142003840 Freedom Evolves]].  Dennett's argument is that if we reject dualism, then we must define the \\"self\\" to be the whole person: body, brain and mind, unconscious, subconscious, and conscious.  Free will, if it is to be debated at all, must be considered to be any actions of the whole person that are not obviously compelled by extraordinary external or internal circumstances (e.g., a gun to the head or a brain tumor in the head).  This is the most sensible passage in the book, and provides a definition that is useful in a social context (e.g., a courtroom). Unfortunately Harris disagrees with it!<br /><br />Indeed, the real flaw of this book is that Harris takes the concept of free will out of its proper social context, and attempts to demonstrate that it is not a \\"real\\" phenomenon within an individual.  This is philosophical mental masturbation, and not of much practical use to anyone.  Harris states in the first sentence of the book, \\"most of what is distinctly human about our lives seems to depend on our viewing one another as autonomous persons, capable of free choice.\\"  His qualification in this sentence is essential, central and accurate:  what is distinctly human, i.e., culture, depends on our viewing one another as having free will. Free will is a social concept, not a physical concept.  Its meaning and significance is almost entirely social, and closely tied to the concept of \\"judgment by another\\".  Whether the judge is a parent, a courtroom Judge, or, for many, God the Almighty, it is important to ask whether the person could have acted differently.  A parent or a Judge well understands the relative and holistic nature of \\"free will\\" in this context.<br /><br />As a parent I do not care if my child was unable to consciously restrain herself from stealing a candy bar.  By treating her crime as one of \\"free will\\", I am teaching her that she must strengthen her superego, and learn to perceive her actions in a broader context that has consequences beyond the immediate for herself and others.  I am training her to develop her own \\"sense of free will.\\"  Eventually, it is to be hoped, she will be able to walk down the candy aisle without even thinking of stealing one.  And that is the point Harris misses:  even if my socially wrong action is out of my conscious control at the moment of action, I - my whole self, am still responsible for not having previously conditioned myself not to act in antisocial ways.<br /><br />Will(power) is something which we are held responsible for developing, primarily within asocial context of right and wrong.  It is not without a basis in biology, in that our DNA pre-disposes us to have and to learn social morals.  But it is understood that both right and wrong and self-control, i.e., will or will-power, are things that must be learned.  That is why the courtroom Judge does not hold the 4-year-old responsible for an act of murder, and gives a different sentence to a murderer who is discovered to have a brain tumor pressing on the pre-frontal lobes of the brain, in which the capability for self-restraint seems to be concentrated. For the Judge or the parent, \\"free will\\" is a useful concept, a shorthand way of saying \\"Nobody forced you to do this, and you knew it was wrong, and you could have acted differently, if you had more effectively pre-conditioned yourself to follow social norms, so let this consequence be a lesson to help you and others do more effective pre-conditioning.\\"<br /><br />In the first paragraph of this book, Harris states that \\"If the scientific community were to declare free will an illusion, it would precipitate a culture war far more belligerent that the one that has been waged on the subject of evolution.\\"  But then Harris immediately in the next few pages goes on to show that with regard to the way he insists on defining free will, as a matter of real-time conscious deliberation and decision, the scientific community has already shown it to be an illusion!  So where is the culture war he warns of?  It hasn't happened because society doesn't much care about the intellectual purity of Harris' definition, and instead holds a tacit understanding of free will that is very much like the \\"whole person\\" definition put forth by Dennett.  Most of society are not philosophers, and we are perfectly happy with the use of free will as a fuzzy-edged concept.<br /><br />Harris' concern about a \\"culture war\\" similar to that stirred by the scientific proof of evolution probably reveals an unstated target for his argument:  the Christian and Muslim emphasis on Judgment by God.  If I have no free will, I hear Harris saying, if my actions are determined by the way \\"God made me\\" and \\"God allowed me to suffer at the hands of others, how then can God damn me?  That is a fair question, but it has more to do with the logic of a omnipotent and vengeful God than with the logic of self-determination.social context of right and wrong.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this application to write down everything from poetry, notes, checklists, passwords, journal entries, ideas, temporary information, etc. Very convenient &amp; easy to use whenever you need to write something &amp; can't find a piwce of paper or don't want to lose that important piece of paper with that job lead or the name of a great author that someone recommended you check out. One of the best features is password protecting notes you don't want others to accidently access when using your phone or &quot;snooping.&quot; I love the ability to change the color of the note in order to categorize them. Also, the ability to share a note with a friend or relative through text or email is a nice feature to have when planning parties &amp; creating checklists of items needed.<br />Once you tried it, you won't be able to do without it. ColorNote is my Go To app everytime I need to write down something that I want to recall later, especially with so many things to remember while multitasking.
B005MMYC7I|3.0|I liked this sort of in-between season. In my opinion it isn't quite as good as season one. The writing seemed a bit off and (someone please tell me if it's my imagination) the dialogue seemed stranger than in the first season. I know they've always spoken in what is supposed to be \\"Latin\\", but this season seemed more immersed in that style than even the previous one. It just seemed a bit awkward at times, a bit forced.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|This is real good sci-fi. There is real excitement.<br />Later, LG sold me 3D TVs and Blu-Ray 3D players that were not ready for the marketplace. LG stinks. It took them over a year to issue a firmware fix/patch for 3 out of 6 products I bought from Amazon.<br /><br />The 3D is very excellent.<br /><br />The lack of 3D takes away from the movie. If these damn studios claim it is 3D then they are liars. There is no in your face 3D in this movie even at the most critical 3D times in the script. And 3D has been around for a century. It was around at the San Francisco World's Fair in 1915.The San Francisco World's Fair's 3D is stunning. Check it out on the WWW.Editing, 3D was around in 1830s in stereoscopic viewers, something like Viewmaster. Euclid himself knew about stereo vision. How ancient is that?<br /><br />I remember the 3 Stooges 3D movie or movies when I was a little kid. The 3D was vastly superior in the day of the 3 Stooges. WYSIWYG. If the cardboard glasses deliver great 3D and Blu-Ray 3D ain't great, which is better?<br /><br />The actors in all these movies are carrying on to keep themselves out of print in the movies themselves. Prometheus is no exception. Perhaps, these morons think they are making a threat with their words,scenes and stupid gestures. I guess they call it a one two career saving punch. Show business would start a war for their next role, their next production. How American can that be?<br /><br />Give me 3D or shove it. Have to pay a premium for 3D that doesn't really exist. The openings have graphically 3D titles. Then the 3D is reduced to about nothing. My LG 3D TV set works. My LG 3D DVD Blu-Ray player has the latest patch. My glasses are the recommended. Got em all at Amazon.<br /><br />There should be laws protecting the consumer over 3D fraud.<br /><br />Show business stinks and are partly responsible for the WorldTradeCenter. 9/11? 9/11 is 911 the police emergency telephone number. Show business and the press have never said a word about that or anything about their entertainment or the telephone companies comments. The government is pathetic and sickening.<br /><br />Would buy Prometheus as a regular DVD release if I were you. Where is the beef? Where is the 3D.<br /><br />Want 3D where I to have duck, bob, dodge and weave objects coming at me. I want the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune in my face. Want to use my arms and hands to defend myself against the 3D onslaught on the screen. Traditional movies have the same vanishing point and perspective basically as most 3D movies. In the critical 3D scenes in Prometheus there was no 3D. The opening with Noomi mulling and puking into a bowl there was no vomit spill over unto the viewer. There was no sand/silica storm blowing in your face. Noomi's operation in the medical pod had no 3D where it was most crucial. The worms/snakes attacking the crew in the alien craft had no 3D whatsoever where it was very important. And on and on...<br /><br />My comments are honest. I am not trying to sound like a snob with excessively florid language. Am not in the employ of the studios. Want Prometheus? Buy the regular DVD and save the difference. Damn good movie. It is a terrific movie.<br /><br />Avatar is coming out next week. Have seen a few clips from a B&W version that had tremendously excellent 3D. Will the new release deliver the same? Hope so.<br /><br />It seems to be my comments turn out differently then what I post.

B00846REIS|5.0|I can't say it wasn't good, the story kept my attention throughout but I can't think of it as a love story. Gideon doesn't want emotional involvement at first and then he cracks and tries to show Eva they are exclusive but the intense emotional relationship borders on the insane.<br /><br />Usually I read a romance and I think how perfect these two are for each other if they would only wake up and see it.<br /><br />This romance book breaks all the rules.<br /><br />Eva and Gideon are bad for each other and they know it.<br /><br />Each of the two main characters is so dysfunctional it borders on crazy. They are not healthy for each other and yet the sex is so intense for them they can't let it go and won't. Both Eva and Gideon are intensely possessive and jealous of everyone that so much looks at the other one and Gideon's behavior borders stalking, but since Eva's mother also is controlling and a stalker, I guess Eva is drawn to that trait.<br /><br />It took a long time for the dominant/submissive relationship to come out.<br /><br />Two other big things I want to mention is this book is written in 1st person. If I had known that I probably wouldn't have bought the book.<br /><br />The ebook has some formatting issues that drove me crazy when I read it. The font would get large and then itsy bitsy every 20 or so pages. If you can ignore it while reading it actually was a good book.<br /><br />Characters are three dimensional and not realistic but modeled after fantasy people or what could be a perfect match, not something I would want to happen to me in a romantic relationship. Gideon is not good at expressing emotions and Eva runs away every time she misinterprets something.<br /><br />It's like watching a bad movie where everything is going so horribly wrong you just can't look away.<br /><br />Good book. Good plot and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it but am not sure I am going to read the next two books. I don't see how two sex abuse victims can live happily ever after together.er after together.

The album is full of boring, slow tempo songs that don't seem to have any heart or soul in them. No Detroit Rock City or Love Gun types on here. All of the songs sound like fillers for some of their other albums. The album to me sounds most like Carnival, which is really disappointing.  There's not a single song on the album that I would want, or care, to hear live.  I really think this album may be the beginning of the end of this version of KISS. Very Sad!

B005FISBTO|2.0|The original Dexter killed those that had escaped the legal system, making the best of his dark passenger. This evolved to where there were circumstances where he had to kill the killer to protect his identity or where he delayed in order to learn from another serial killer. That is all gone in this season. Dexter chooses to suppress evidence because he _wants_ get to the killer before the police.<br /><br />The Colin Hanks character is an inadequate villain, both in what the script gave Hanks to work with and what he brought to it. The character isn't interesting -- he lacks intensity and smarts, and didn't even rise to the level of \\"the banality of evil\\".<br /><br />The religious theme - the intended point-counterpoint for the season - is provided with neither the detail nor the conviction needed.<br /><br />Missing are the clever twists and turns, although there are some wobbles. But mostly it is a tired procedural. I found multiple sections to be tedious. And too many elements that were repeated from earlier season apparently only out of inertia. And the new side plots ranged from insipid to annoying.<br /><br />Too much of the plot depends on the characters doing stupid things and failing to take normal actions (details would be spoilers).<br /><br />One of the underlying themes of the series is a highly dysfunctional person fighting to hide it and appear to be absolutely normal, with \\"normal\\" being counter-pointed by characters who are quirky (short of dysfunctional). This season has the Dexter character being the normal, well-adjusted, emotionally stable, responsible person surrounded by characters who are relentlessly dysfunctional. This might be the basis for a different series (a sitcom?), but it is not \\"Dexter\\".<br /><br />\\"Dexter\\" is about being clever and skewed, but this season was just hackneyed.<br /><br />-- Douglas B. Moran

B007A2O3FO|2.0|Too many holes and inconsistencies in the script. I was looking for a Downton Abbey quality movie but it ended up looking like a bland formula redux Disney family searches for lost treasure on island type script. Lots of formula clichés ranging from WWII military dad is lost at war while family holds out hope even though the family is about to lose their heirloom home;; scene shifts to decades earlier and a blind daughter to pull on heart strings with a selfish mom; kind servants with one evil servant to provide the criminal mystery; back to the present a young relative comes to stay, discovers himself, solves the mystery and saves the house.<br /><br />The strange part is that all those people inhabit two quite different time periods thus to connect the stories we have the young relative traveling back in time to interact with the now dead previous inhabitants of the house. By the way time travel to a past that doesn't exist is just made-up fantasy.<br />People die or just disappear from the script with little or no explanation. A gold stirrup is found but never mentioned again. Gold and jewels are somehow easily found after decades by the young visiting relative. Ghosts can be seen by some but not by others. Ghosts sometimes go through things and at other times step over things. Characters were as shallow as 30 second sound bites which is about all they did for the entire movie. Add the constant scene jumping and rather than a flow the story felt like a a turbulence.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|This is a very good movie..touching and a curious twist at the end..Wonderful acting..Keep Kleenex handy!..I give it 5 stars..
B008H6GHL0|1.0|Watching this movie was like watching a video game being ported from one platform to another (in this case, comic book to film) primarily for the sake of making money. Motion and performance capture has been around for 30+ years and this movie did nothing to advance that technique and art. I didn't know what was worse the plastic like portrayals (both as characters and as CGI); the non-creative storyline with the usual tiresome, been done before, creatures; or, the juvenile dialogue that sounded like a third grade reading primer (of course, excused if that was the intended target audience). It soon became apparent that the studio was going to rely upon CGI and performance capture gee-whiz graphics to sell their otherwise shallow story.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|ZOMBIES!!!!  Zombies are my favorite all time killing horror flicks ever no matter how cheesy they get I still love them... This was my first zombie movie I ever saw when I was younger and that's what started my obsession.  This movie is an ultimate classic or has everything it it from guns gore chaos and a Lil humor.  I suggest this movie to anyone who enjoys the classics
B0094GW6YE|5.0|This new album is worth every penny. All the songs have hard and heavy riffs, fueled with wicked solos. Monster could very well be one of the best Rock albums of 2012. 20 years ago, KISS released Revenge, and 20 years later, KISS release Monster, both albums are much alike. If you liked Revenge, then Monster is Highly Recommended.
B008BM9L72|4.0|You must read all three books to get the full story behind Mr Fifty Shades. I did enjoy the emails between the two of them and the love story, the sex scenes descibed through the three books were relevant to the story but certainly x rated. I would read another novel by this author.
1849905452|5.0|First let me say that I almost never write reviews. But I absolutely loved this book.  Rose and the 10th doctor have always been my favorite so I always look for new books with the two of them.  That being said though I rarely find a book that I think fits their relationship and characters so well. The author did a great job of protraying the characters right down to the interactions between the Doctor and Rose to each of the characters manerisms.  I could almost see things as they were taking place. I really loved that the author allowed us to follow the Doctor, to hear his thoughts and to see how he was affected by everything that was taking place. It is something that we almost never get in the books but something that was always, atleast for me, easy to see in the shows. It did take me a couple chapters to really get into it but once there I couldn't help but be pulled in as the story unfolded.

B008XG1X18|5.0|completely love this app, works great on my kindlea as well as my cell phone, so much bettervthan the mobile site
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is a great coming of age story - very relatable and poignant.  I read this book in one day and was disappointed when it was over.  It most definitely takes the reader back to high school and feelings associated with that time in everyone's life.  I am usually let down when a book I've read is made into a movie, so I hope this is a good transition.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this covers all I need to know about battery life and enables me to spend less time hooking up and charging my kindle.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great game. Not too hard but just enough to keep it interesting. I look forward to the next installment of the game.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|Monster is a much better than Sonic Boom. It is great to have new material from them and not have to wait 10 years for it. The best songs are Genes \\"Wall of sound\\", \\"Back to the Stone age\\", and Paul's \\"Shout Mercy and \\"Last Chance\\". The other songs are pretty good to ok, Eric 's vocal on \\"All for the love of Rock n Roll\\" is very Peter like that you could almost hear him sing thus one. Tommy's outta this world has a good chorus but he can look or try to sound like it he is No ACE FREHLEY! I did enjoy this one though, good effort. KISS is still my favorite band ever, even if I don't agree with their career choices. Much thanks to Paul and Gene for keeping it going so long!
B003LSTK8G|5.0|I made the leap into this book in an effort at better understanding the criminality of those responsible for the \\"crash\\" that has devastated so many lives. The author did not let me down. Mr. Lewis has provided and understandable (for non-1%'er) view into the pile of crap ladled out from our nations' bank and investment brokers. The extent of greed and avarice in unlimited.<br /><br />A must read. Especially when you consider the mindset of who might be President.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I like long books.  There are so many different story lines I have to stay alert.  The author really gives a felling of the atmosphere before WW!!.  Sometimes the characters are one dimensional so I can't give it 5 stars but I enjoy reading the book.
B005LAIHHC|5.0|I have watched this movie like 20 times since i got it funny as hell. Great price fast shipping. A must buy if you love Sacha Baron Cohen.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I am not quite finished with the book, but it is awesome so far.  I think it has definitely helped me to understand my marriage better and has strengthened our marriage.  I feel like I have been looking for answers that I have found in this book for years.  I am thankful to the person who reccomended the book for me, and I would reccomend the book to all couples or singles who have struggled in relationships.
B0026IQY9A|5.0|Funny as hell worth the buy... Fast easy shipping. Great price. Watched it several times hilarious a must buy if you like Borat or bruno
B002U0KHMY|5.0|I purchased White Collar season one after I stumbled across it at the library and borrowed it. Before the first disc was done I was on amazon.com looking it up for purchase. The show is great. You have an FBI Agent assigned to White Collar crimes and he is paired with a con artist that he has caught twice. Together they solve the crimes. The cast of characters is awesome in the show. Matt Bomer as Neal, Tim DeKay as Peter, Tiffani Thiessen as Elizabeth, Willie Garson (loved him on Sex and the City)He is absolutely amazing on this show. Diahann Carroll is wonderful and funny as Neal's 'landlady'. This is a series you need to own!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|A very interesting book that provided a unique insight into the Navy SEAL program and what exactly makes the 'most lethal sniper in US history' tick.<br /><br />The author (Chris) takes a very honest approach to his life as a SEAL and the ramifiacations his career had on him personally. His attitudes and opinions to what it takes to be a life-taking soldier are always brutally honest and provide an insightful look into the mind of an American special forces soldier.<br /><br />As an Australian, I was particuarly interested in the mentality behind being an American soldier, especially during the post September 11 conflicts.<br /><br />While there is plenty of action, recounted very well, you might be surprised at the degree to which Chris talks about the impact of being a soldier on his family and particular his wife.<br /><br />Overall a good book and definately worth the read if you are interested in what would seem to be a unique look at the life of one of history's dealiest soldiers.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I work the night shift and have a  hard time sleeping during the day this app works wonderfully pair of headphones 10mins and I am out for the day. If in doubt try the free version but the paid version adds some nice extras.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Just felt that this book was not up to the usual standards of a Lee Child novel. The plot unraveled slowly, and I think the killing of the best character in the novel (Sorenson) was not needed.......still enjoyed it, just not up to the usual Jack Reacher stories.  Basically for me, just too much time spent on narrative relative to the various car rides.....seemed to, almost always, be in a car....until the end.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Great book! Victoria is a character that will be remembered for her strength and for her ability to overcome her past.
B006T5JUFQ|5.0|One of the best books I ever read. Amazing description of what goes on in people´s heads. Very insightful in the way children think and feel.I love the backdrop of the vacation beach house and how the family and the guests get on. I lot of thick description of the beautiful garden, the bay. Not a book for action-lovers.
098555780X|5.0|The books are great, because they offer some ties I haven't yet seen on the internet.  I prefer his videos, as they are more varied, love the music and so brilliantly put together (ie. idiot proof).  The main reasons I bought both his books, were primarily because it's a way of thanking him for all of his hard work and dedication and also because they're handy to have, when you don't have access to a pc.<br />Thank you JD!<br />Looking forward to subsequent volumes!
B008OJ291W|5.0|This disc would seem to be pointless if it didn't kick so much butt! Turn it way up and marvel at the ageless wonder of Jeff Lynne.
B0078JOAOI|3.0|This show actually has decent production values and some good acting. The writing is pretty pathetic though. If anything can go wrong in any situation you can rest assured it will go wrong. In fact nothing ever works out right. In the realm of human affairs things will go wrong at most maybe 50% of the time. In the realm of the Walking Dead things go wrong about 99% of the time. If someone needs to run to escape the zombies that person will without fail trip or fall and twist or sprain their ankle. Whatever device they need to work in a particular situation will not work. This whole scenario applies to everything they do , to the point of being absurd.  The characters for the most part are about as superficial , selfish ,and stupid as any humans could ever be. Since I get it virtually for free on Netflix I will occasionally watch it for fun. It keeps me laughing the whole time. The fact that so many people think this is a great show is very scary to me, far more scary than the show is, or ever could be.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|This series would have been better had it been written with just two books.  Wrapping it up in book 2 would have been appreciated by this reader.  The third book was boring and very hard to imagine in any sense.  Bad part is, if you  read the first 2, you really don't want to miss the ending.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I do not usually read this type of book, but I had to see what everyone at work was talking about. I could not put them down. They kept me wanting to know more. I hope there is still more to come.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|This album is great. I wish I would have bought the not-so-explicit version so that I could listen to it while my son is in the car. Other than that, I love it!
1401322786|5.0|Great book.  A lot of \\" Life Lessons \\" can be learned. My first book by Mitch Alborn but it won't be my last.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it keeps your mind going.  really good for cordination with your hands.I play it for desrltress my day. have fun
B008G8SFGO|4.0|I get so pumped when the \\"past their prime\\" types shows age ain't nothin' but a number. I just downloaded all the songs - and wow. Not at all bad. In fact, even some fist pumping moments! And it usually takes me a while to warm up to new music from any band. So it's only getting better from here as I listen more. I was a fan from when I opened my Christmas present - the Love Gun album (with all the goodies inside - what was my Mom thinking!). I am trying to figure where this album falls. Definitely not the recent stuff. Some feel like the old stuff. Not even close to the middle stuff. So I am going to settle with, comfortable and then some.<br /><br />Ok - a few thoughts. The recording lacks dynamic range (is this a technique or a quality thing? Sorry for my ignorance) - but it adds to the nostalgia. Feels like I have an 8-track in the deck.  I am still getting familiar with the songs - but, I got to tell ya'... \\"Right Here Right Now\\" was downright inspirational. I will add more comments on other songs after I listen to them a bit more.<br /><br />Keep rockin' everyone! Shout it out loud until your last breath!!!<br /><br />Ken
B0084B5TK8|3.0|I liked  it but really it was not what i expected it to be. the ending was way too short and left you hanging for  more.... really i.expected more from a “classic“ such as this.
B00514HDNW|4.0|I was very interested to see the original version of this story, having seen the Will Smith version a few years back.  I must say that, like most movies, the book is better.  I prefer the ending of the book over the movie, too.  It's a more uplifting view of the death and destruction of the human race.
B001940IB2|5.0|I was alittle worried about how this would sound do to the fact it's been along since this CD was made.I'm a big Roy Orbison fan so I bought it.I was totaly surprised.It sounded great.I'm very happy with this CD.<br />  Thanks Raymond
B008B0QH5S|1.0|This just can't be the last PSB album.  Please, no.  I get what they're trying to do, but this pales in comparison to Behaviour and Very and even Yes.
B008PNBU30|1.0|But this isn't them. I dunno if its cause Adam is off the meds, or if Neil is doing most of the writing now... But this is just plain bad.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|I enjoy watching Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan in this movie. I find if I'm not feeling to well all I have to do is watch this movie and I'm feeling a lot better. I'n not into the type of dancing that this movie is about but the over all story is very nice.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This movie is amazing! I saw it in the theater 5 times, and it only got better each time!<br />Tom Hardy was my favorite part of this film! I loved every second he was on screen. Even though he was very evil- I felt for him! Just look into his eyes! His voice was so intriguing/exciting and I wished I was there to fix his mask for him when Batman punched it.<br />Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman were wonderful AS ALWAYS.<br />I'm sure Marion Cotillard was great as an actress- but I am a little bias because I did not like her character. And I didn't get the deal with her and Bane. Were they supposed to be romantic or not?<br />Anne Hathaway... puke! I don't know, I felt like some of her lines sounded cheesy like, \\"My mother told me not to get into cars with strange men.\\" And every time she kissed Bruce/Batman, it seemed out of place. Like it was supposed to be romantic but it wasn't at all. Not to nit-pick but I felt like her voice was lame and her character was an idiot. I just didn't like her character.<br />Joesph-Gordon Levitt, as an actor I think he did well. But I just didn't like his character in this or Inception, kind of trying to be a tough guy. I feel like he was way better in Looper, even though he looked creepy.<br />Overall, buy this movie and if you do not love it then you are a ding-dong (or it's not for you, which is okay too).
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|At first I thought it a little long, but the length proved invaluable after I rearranged my workspace to accommodate a printer.
B008N2Z1L0|5.0|After 13 years of playing together (augemented by different sideman at different times) Rami Jaffee, Jakob Dylan and Greg Richling decided to take a break.  Richling went on produce acts;  Jaffee sought greener pastures with the Foo Fighters and Dylan signed his first solo deal and started working with Rick Rubin on his debut.<br /><br />Fast forward to seven years later, Dylan released to two strong records including 2010's Women + Country which contains some of the finest lyrics he has ever written.<br /><br />Which brings us to the release of \\"Glad All Over\\" the first Wallflowers record since 2005's \\"Rebel, Sweetheart\\".  This record is brimming with confidence, bravado and an energy that has alluded the band since its debut twenty years ago.  The new additions to the group are drumming legend Jack Irons and Stuart Mathis on lead guitar both of whom bring their chops to the band but never overwhelm it's core made up of Dylan, Jaffee and Richling.<br /><br />Highlights include the soaring \\"Love is a Country\\", the slithering \\"Constellation Blues\\" and the two Mick Jones collaborations. The wind in your hair \\"Misfits and Lovers\\" and the should-be radio smash \\"Reboot the Mission\\" which is an all around hypnotic track.<br /><br />I truly don't believe there is a bad song on this record and I tip my hat to Jay Joyce who managed to get a tight, concise record from the band at this stage in their career.  While it seems a break was necessary for the guys let's hope the fans don't have to wait another seven years for a new record.
B00062PN6I|5.0|i just got these today and they are the best headphones i heard yet the bass and just the sound quality is wonderful i got it for my ipod and i love it there really load for the price i had left them in the living room and i can still hear the music in the kitchen and they don't hurt my ears
B008MU8ZNO|5.0|I can't even remember the first time I saw this movie. It would have been sometime after it came out and was being played on HBO back around '89 or so. I've seen it countless times. It's cheesy, campy, kinda crappy, but one of the best cult classic movies ever. They would never make a movie like this now, 9 foot tall creepy alien klowns who wrap people up in cotton candy and suck them dry. Yea, no Hollywood Doug would ever green light that project now. Im thankful they didn't f&%@ this movie up with a crappy sequel either. I hate sequels. Ghostbusters 2 is the worst! We don't need a sequel to Killer Klowns From Outer Space, we don't need a remake either. What we need is a remastered transfer and Criterion Collection treatment for this cult classic film. Since that will never happen, you can get this really good transfer on Blu-Ray. The detail and edges are sharp, there is no DNR and the overall look is probably cleaner and better than it has ever looked. Highly recommended to fans of horror and cult classics.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Family movie for all.Grownups will love it too.Me and my children really enjoyed it.Fun and funny.Loved it.kids just loved it.Entertaining funny.
B000W4HIX6|5.0|One of the best movies ever made. It builds tension, suspense, has some of the best action scenes ever filmed and even a spot of brief female nudity. John McTiernan directs Bruce Willis in this 1988 master piece of modern cinema. While Michael Kamen's score is a bit derivative of his score for Lethal Weapon (1987) the year before, he outshines his work on Lethal Weapon with his melodic and memorable score for Die Hard. I think everyone that was a part of this film was at their best.<br /><br /> McTiernan (Predator) does his best work here weaving a straight forward plot which we see the protagonist pitted against foreign thieves in a skyscraper. The pacing, cinematography, musical score, acting, stunts, action and story all work perfectly together to create a piece of modern art that really hasn't been rivaled by any other action film since its release nearly 30 years ago. On Blu-Ray this movie shines. I still think this movie should be treated to a Criterion Collection release but I'm sure the Hollywood Dougs won't let it happen.<br /><br />Yet this transfer looks as close to immaculate as possible. There is no DNR, blacks are deep, colors are vibrant or muted when they should be, detail is very sharp and crisp and the natural film grain is still visible. This is probably the best Christmas movie ever made (although A Christmas Story is an amazing film on the other end of the Christmas movie spectrum) and one of the few Christmas movies I can tolerate to watch during other seasons of the year.<br /><br />I saw this film at a very young age when it was first available on home video back in '89. It was the most violent and intense movie I had ever seen up to that point in time. Only being five at the time one would think it too intense of a movie for someone that young to be watching, but it is pure fun without being offensive. Unless of course you're a Japanese businessman or a German thief posing as a terrorist. I think I smiled ear to ear the whole time watching it, I had never seen a movie like it, and I still haven't seen a movie quite like it. Not only is it the best Christmas movie ever, it's the best action movie ever and easily one of the best films ever made. This is cinema at its best. This is art at its best.<br /><br /> There are no new features on this Blu-Ray release that haven't been included on previous releases of this film, but it looks better than it ever has which is reason enough to own this on Blu-Ray. Any fan of film or Bruce Willis or action movies needs to own this. The holiday season is coming up, you don't want to miss this masterpiece.t, I had never seen a movie like it, and I still haven't seen a movie quite like it.

B0076UXKDG|3.0|Update:  Last week the MB-D12 started to make rattling sounds, It is coming from the battery tray. After examining, it looks like there is a seal missing from the battery compartment and also the tray itself dose not hold the EN-EL15 battery in place firmly and it knocks against the grip.<br /><br />It works, but not the best quality and it is over priced. Wait a while longer if you really don't need it.<br /><br />Like many photographers I am used to expensive accessories.  I understand value and don't mind paying for it.  Nikon sales this same handgrip under the MB-D14 for D-600 for $125 less.  The two are identical in function except for a few millimeter differences in dimensions to fit different bodies, yet Nikon price this one 25% more. Why?<br />There are many after market ones that are available now.<br /><br />I am a long time Nikon user and think that their products are good value but every now and then they need to be reminded that they need to respect their customers.  if you are really a fan of nikon then help them get it right by telling them when they get it wrong.
B0080QOLCE|4.0|This isn't an original concept. It's Invaders From Mars, it's The Puppet Masters, Invasion Of The Body Snatchers and so on. Take that concept and add in teen angst and a good cast directed by Robert Rodriguez and you get a decent but predictable movie. This is the kind of movie that could really benefit from more female nudity. I think Rodriguez has done better, I think most of the cast has done better, but I got this for $5.99 on Blu-Ray. It's definitely worth the price and looks pretty sharp and clean on Blu-Ray. If you're looking for a cheap and good way to kill an hour and a half, this isn't too bad.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was very suspenseful, and I didn't want to put it down. The book starts with the meeting between the Greeks and Romans. This leads to a hasty flight on the Argo 2 from the Roman camp and a journey all the way to Rome. I liked how the book only used 4 points of view instead of all 7. I also liked the characters Rick Riordan chose to tell the story. I enjoy Leo especially because he ties in some humor in with his POV. I also enjoyed Annabeth's POV because it revealed more information on how she feels about the situation and about her in general. Overall, I think the book is a must-read for any Percy Jackson fans. It has humor, suspense, action, and adventure. It also makes you want to continue reading the series because it has a huge cliff hanger at the end similar to the Son of Neptune. However, I don't think this is Riordan's best work, but I do think it is in the top 3 of the best of his works.
B000QFW7UA|5.0|I pre-ordered this off of Amazon. Why it doesn't show that I purchased it is beyond me. Anyhow, the packaging is great. I wish more movies got this kind of treatment for their Blu-Ray release, Ghostbusters, Big Trouble In Little China and Die Hard really should have gotten this kind of treatment. The box for the 25th anniversary of The Goonies is great, the inside cover has the map to the treasure of One Eyed Willie, there is a board game it comes with, a press release kit recreation that was shrunk down and some other goodies. The overall presentation of this is stellar. They really couldn't have done a better job. I have heard some complaints about the transfer but I think it looks borderline immaculate. There is no DNR, not too many soft edges, no muddy images, it looks sharp and crisp and retains a lot of the original film grain. There's a decent amount of special features and I am really glad I got this, it's well worth the price. If you grew up with this movie and are a fan, you need this. Thankfully they still haven't made a sequel to this like they have talked about. Sequels suck folks, If you don't believe me, look at what those Hollywood Dougs did with Ghostbusters, because Ghostbusters 2 is one of the worst sequels ever. It completely undermines the first film (which is a modern masterpiece of cinema) and isn't a good movie in any way, shape or form. I just hope they don't try and squeeze more money out of the Goonies by making some crappy, forced sequel. This movie is one of the best ever made, they won't ever make a better kids movie that plays up the magic that all kids movies should have without going too overboard. You need to own this on Blu-Ray.
159420411X|4.0|As a long-time reader of Nate Silver's blog, I was very happy to buy this book.<br /><br />The book contains lots of great information about prediction in diverse fields. If you are a reader of his blog, you might have expected this book to have a lot of political content and perhaps even go into details of how Nate does his political forecasting. I certainly expected that, and was a little disappointed to find that politics does not take up much space in this book. But that is no matter, the content is excellent nevertheless.<br /><br />The only criticism I have of the book is about style. I feel that the editors could have done a better job of pruning the text as well as improving the language in a few places. At times it feels like there has been some filler inserted --- the author has a tendency to include sweeping general statements that aren't strictly necessary to advance his argument. For example, going into theology in the introduction when talking about what forecasting and prediction mean. These general statements are mostly confined to the introduction, though.<br /><br />Another minor nitpick is that the author seems a little too fond of the word \\"literally\\", which I feel a good editor should have excised in many places.<br /><br />None of this should prevent you from buying the book. It is an insightful and informative work that brings together the lessons of prediction from many different fields and explains it all very well.
B002BVQU5A|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies...it's a love story that's more about overlooking the norm and just finding the love...Sam and Joon are a great example of how anything is possible...

B007SGM084|5.0|I adore all three of these books. E.L. James knew what she was doing when she wrote them. Seeing as how she was an over night sensation. For those saying that they are not well written are obviously oblivious to what a \\"sexy, fun, relaxed\\" read is all about. I couldn't put the books down. Can't wait for the movie!!
B007CSWMWM|5.0|This is an awesome little book!  I stumbled onto it by accident from a friend, and ordered 2 more copies to give away.  It's heartwarming and uplifting, full of beautiful insights on living - and on dying.  It's not only for those facing a terminal illness, but for everyone who would like to be uplifted and inspired from another person's journey through their last days.  A must read!!!

I know, I know I need to buy more lol. I wear tennis shoes so running from the zombies won't be an issue for me. Tennis shoes are quiet so I won't draw attention from them. So women who wear high heels you have been warned... when the zombies come you'll be attracting the \\"walkers\\" and have difficulty running. LOL

I notified the vendor and they replaced the CD without any questions.  The new CD works great!  This vendor is very trustworthy and a pleasure to work with.  Thanks for the great service.

0307592731|5.0|Such a great story. In contrast to Eat, Pray, Love where Elizabeth Gilbert told us that we deserve to be happy, Cheryl Strayed shows us what it looks like to work to be happy, to walk 1000 miles to get the Wild out of our system and _earn_ our happiness.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I read the first book in the series, and I thought it was alright.  I liked it, but wasn't in love with it.  However, once I start a series I have to keep up with it, and I was anxious to see what was in store for these characters!  Well, I LOVED the sequel!  Now, I am hooked and can't wait for the next one to come out.  I felt much more invested in the characters this time around, and their love story was more believable.  If you read the first one, don't give up!!  Keep reading the series, it gets so much better!
B0094GW6YE|1.0|I will make this simple, this is by far the most Boring , lamest album Kiss has ever released. Terrible cover to boot!! These guys are around 60 and singing about stuff that was reserved for bands in spandex on the Sunset Strip in the 80's. As a lifelong KISS fan it hurts me to say it but they need to retire.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|This. Album. Is. Amazing.<br />Flo's voice just sends chills up my spine. It's as soft as a feather, and as powerful as a rock. It flows like the silks of her dresses and is full of knowledge beyond her years.<br /><br />The beat and music behind her is truly beautiful. The drums make your heart beat with wild passion and the sweet tug of the violin strings soothes you. And don't get me started on the piano solos.<br /><br />This album will definitely leave you breathless and hungry for more.<br /><br />My 3 Favotite Songs:<br /><br />Only If For A Night - the first track on the album is truly amazing. It's all about the loss of someone close to you. Not a lover, per-say, maybe a relitive or a freind. And when the song ended, I couldn't help but sing to myself, \\"and I heard your voice as clear as day, and you told me I should 'hit replay'.\\"<br /><br />What The Water Gave Me is a perfect song for Halloween. For some reson, whenever I hear it, I think of ghosts and the dead and skeletons and Witches and drowning. Not only is Flo's voice haunting, but the music is quite creepy.<br /><br />Shake It Out is suprimly powerful. The notes Florence reaches is just mind-blowing. People only 'say' she screams because there jelous of her amazing talent. But once you hear her, you'll know that she isn't screaming. Trust me; I know what scraming is. I've heard myself sing. :D<br /><br />(Also, Breath Of Life, a song created for the Snow White & The Huntsman movie, is amazing as well. It is the real spine-chiller. You will listen to it again and again and never become bored. But sadly it's not on this album.)
B001AP11KW|5.0|Jack White is just great no matter what band he's in. Awesome in THE WHITE STRIPES and more defined with THE RACONTEURS !!!
B00499LTLM|5.0|Fast paced, brilliant text, witty remarks, great actors and amazing story. I believe Sir Conan Doyle would have been proud of this rendition. As always only PBS could bring this wonderful series to US.
0307914550|5.0|I gave this to my son, who is a runner and he was able to enjoy it as he drove to work and back.  He said it was interesting and enjoyed it a great deal.  Other runners who I asked for recommendaions on a gift had suggested it and said they thought it would be a great gift and it was.....
B008VBYN80|3.0|the game could move a litter faster, but other than that great game. I don't that so much stuff cost diamonds!  I would recommend for someone who time waste and some money to spend on diamonds.:)
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Simply a great comic book movie.  I have watched this with kids and adults age 7-40  everyone loves it.  The violence is comic book for the most part.  There are some language issues in a few places, but for the most part it's fun with a few moral lessons thrown in for good measure
B00932A2MC|4.0|As crazy as it sounds, I fully enjoyed this movie.  I expected an OK movie that was completely mindless, and while I did get that, it was just way better than expected.  Cool movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a really good game. Great visuals. When I saw this game I was like oh my God I have to get this<br />game and its flat out awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B0086700CM|5.0|I think it is fun. There are different paths each time you restart or start. Well done makers of this.
B00887490Y|3.0|Jessica Biel did a great job! SHE CAN ACT..she's talented.  The movie started out good, it had that good creepy vibe...but as it went on it was confusing and boring. I wouldnt watch it again.
1579129129|3.0|Simon Winchester is one of my favorite non-fiction writers, but he is not much of a presence in this book.  There are several blocks of text but it is just mostly lots of pictures of skulls and skeletons.  If you are looking for a book to look at, this is a beautiful example, but not much to read.  Check it out at your library before you purchase.
B005ZTFPFQ|4.0|This is a fairly large collection of Atari games, but it does not have games like Megamania, which is the game I was trying to find when I got this Atari Game collection.<br /><br />Some of the controls are confusing, and it takes some adjustment to get used to the controls, but it will help you waste plenty of time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the details of the book. the war the mainly with peeta and katniss. the mystery was amazing i loved the ending. but wished there was some pages of the getting back together. happy they are but would have liked the wedding, a disccusion about the kids, their lovely kisses. wish that was there. but great ending.
B0034G4ORM|5.0|This was a gool ol' fashion shoot 'em up movie. Shakespeare it is not, nor did it advertise itself to be. The critics, mainly LIBERAL critics hated it for what they say was it's \\"overt showing of the flag and gunho militarism.\\"  Rubbish. This movie, although a tad slow in places and rather cliched dialogue, is just a FUN movie from beginning to end.  It is \\"IWO JIMA\\" but with a SCIF flavor. The special effects are swesome, the storyline..though not worthy of an Oscar was acceptable and the premise left it open for sequels!! Buy this movie, I plan too!
0307950689|5.0|Incredible story with unexpected turns and bizarre twists would not let you put this book down until you read it. Started it and had to finish in a couple of days! The way the characters are presented or weaved into the story line is just amazingly well down. Excellent job by Mr. Brown yet again. Cannot wait for his next novel! I recommend this book without any doubts.
B005FMZVLQ|1.0|The presentation is very cheesy for supposedly an expensive watch. Come on Amazon you can do better than this.  I'm almost to embarrassed to give it as a gift.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Good movie, even better on Blu Ray.<br />The special features are cool too.<br />Unbelievable price!<br />Tom Cruise is a good actor.
B0086700CM|5.0|its a great game and it has great graphics also...love love love this game my kids even enjoy it...I have it for my android phone my ipod and nowky kindle fire very good game
B006JSXYPA|4.0|Thought the 3d quality could of been better. Great movie on blu ray though! Hopefully they come out with a fourth one.
0810989956|5.0|We got this for my daughter for her 9th birthday and she LOVES it!!!!! She has spent hours filling it in and loves making up stories to write in the book.
B008HOR7VQ|5.0|I've been a fan of Mark Knopfler since I first heard Dire Straits' \\"Making Movies\\" back in '83.  I was delighted then to learn that there were two earlier albums which I promptly bought.  They got me through high school and into college, and I still love them as though I first heard them yesterday.  Last week, I purchased Mark's latest, the double album \\"Privateering\\".  I paid a little extra and got the bonus CD containing live recordings of songs from \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\", \\"Rag Pickers Dream\\", \\"Get Lucky\\", and \\"Privateering\\".<br /><br />I am extremely pleased with the new compilation.  As with much of Mark's solo work, the album bounces back and forth across the Atlantic deeply seeded in trans-continental roots.  The music is a blend of Celtic, folk, jazz, boggie woogie, and blues.  Mark travels fluidly between genres.  I am enjoying it all.  This album is a bit more into the blues than Mark's previous solo albums, and the introduction of my old harp playing hero from the Fabulous Thunderbirds - Kim Wilson - is an absolute delight!  Mark and Kim craft a savory guitar harp combo that evokes a bit of Kim's collaborations with Jimmy Vaughn and also a bit of the traditional blues flavor of Ry Cooder's work with Sonny Terry on the Crossroads soundtrack. And, with all of Mark's music, he takes the music and his listeners to another realm.<br /><br />You won't go wrong with this album.  Thanks Mark!
B009329Y30|4.0|Its a fantastic story and movie very romantic I will definitely watch it again. I wonder how long it took him to find this woman.
B008XG1X18|5.0|easy access and no lag. easy to use and able to access all my boards with no issue. I love it.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Season Four does not disappoint. There is a great deal of plot advancement between the main characters. Plus, all the original playfulness and fun is still there!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie is good, but watching it in 3D makes it awesome!  Out of all the 3D movies we own, this one has the best 3D effects, I dare say even better than watching it in 3D at the theater.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Dylan has been up and down since the early -70's. Yet, his music remains a lynch-pin of American culture, as it stands in the latter half of the 20th century. This record is one of his very best post - 60's efforts. I firmly believe that 100 years from now, people will be studying this man's work much as we study the work of Stephen Foster and Walt Whitman today. He has been a student of Americana his entire life and it shows. He will be part of Americana long after we are all gone. I will enjoy and marvel at his work for as long as I can. Thanks, Bob - my children's children study and enjoy what you have done.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|So I'm not really sure how to review this on its own. I can't help but think of it as a continuation of Game of Thrones. It doesn't stop getting interesting, you've already grown attached to the characters and this part gets you even more into them.<br />The \\"weird\\" thing is that you get some new characters and that might not be as fun as the other chapters, but that's just because you've grown closer to the other characters and know more about them by now.<br /><br />You can't stop after Game of Throne! You must keep up with this one... things are just starting to get massive!
B00914JWSW|5.0|Just finished listening to Release Me and it is hard to believe that these were the songs that were leftovers or songs not considered good enough for Barbra's Albums! Every song is a masterpiece and what I enjoy about the album is that you get to hear Barbra and her various singing styles from the 1960's up to the Present! I hope Barbra releases more albums like this from her vaults! Amazing!
B008Y5OW20|1.0|I am an ELO fan, and Jeff created expectations when he said he had worked on this project for years. When I started listening to it I thought I pressed the wrong button on the iPod. This is not ELO, this is not Travelling Wilbury's. This is simply the worst CD I have heard in years.  I was expecting something very different.

0307887448|2.0|the lead characters remind me of the bad guy in king of Kong. the cockiness and douchebaggery that can only be exhibited by these nerdy video game dorks.. wade reminds me of the comic book guy from the Simpsons. I love to laugh at these characters misfortunes, but could never root for them in a lead role. I gave 2 stars because I quit 100 pages in, and just assumed it has to get better.
B007STBUIW|5.0|What a difference blu-ray makes!  This is liking watching a brand new movie, with a sharp sound track and crystal clear picture.  Highly recommended for all JAWS fans.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I have to admit. I love Folletts work. Yeah, it's predictable sometimes and a bit corny, but it is such a joy to read. This book is no exception. Masterfully written and woven through 4 countries, this book was a great escape.
B007ORVC36|5.0|MADMEN ON AMAZON IS ALMOST UNWATCHABLE IN THE REGULAR (NON-HD)FORMAT,EVEN WITH A 7.0 Mbps CABLE CONNECTION. THE PICTURE IS BLURRY AND INDISTINCT AND EVEN THE SOUND WAS A BIT OFF. IF YOU CAN'T WATCH IT ON T.V., EVEN WITH THE ANNOYING ADS, OR ON NETFLIX, BETTER TO FIND ANOTHER PROGRAM TO WATCH.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I enjoyed the game all the way through! Great story too. I will definitely be looking for more by this developer.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Wow!  Talk about being glued to the TV.  We had to pace ourselves to make the series last longer.  Television at its best!
B008XG1X18|5.0|great app for pinterest. I really like it a lot and spend a lot of time using it. its is just as good as being on the actual pinterest website
0525952926|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  Couldn't wait to start reading it and when I started it, I couldn't put it down.
B0017SWPXY|3.0|I read this book solely based on the amount of stars and rave reviews.  I found this book to be o.k.  I am a dog lover and thought the point of view coming from a dog was something new and sometimes funny.  But the book was predictable, and the story plain.  If you want an easy read, then go for it.
B00005JKGZ|2.0|I love this musical and know all the songs by heart. I care for my 100 year old grandmother and I can honestly say that this is her most requested movie,we have watched it up to 3 times a week.Her VHS copy got ruined sso I turned to a DVD version. Was so dissapointed to get the dvd and find out that th whole trolly song is scratched! This is the best part of the movie! Funny....I ordered a \\"new\\" dvd.....
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is like Mario and it is awesome  can never find a decent game for my kindle this is awesome definitely get this gqme

B007GCY8FS|5.0|After the last few Reacher books I thought that Lee Child had run out of gas - plots were just too preposterous. This one is tight, snappy and suspenseful - much more like the early Reacher novels.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|I saw this movie when it came out, and I really enjoyed it a lot. I wanted to see a fun movie, with action and vampires that don't glow (unlike some others that do). I had really liked the book, and was hoping to see a movie that is well adapted from the novel. And to me personally along with some other people who I know it was great. The director Timur has done a great job along with the cast. It was a different take on a significant event of the American history, will deff buy it on dvd when it comes out.<br />Will update this review with info on the extras the dvd contains.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Here is a novel that is just good enough to keep you reading. You think, something is getting ready to happen, I just know it. But that something never materializes and then the author seems to run out of steam and ideas. You sit there after reading the last sentence thinking \\"Really?? That's all she could come with??\\" I was very disappointed in this read. I read it for my book club, and we all agreed. Not one I can recommend, sorry Gillian.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book will keep you guessing, just when you think you have this mystery figured out another twist occurs.  Great read!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Came upon this book without knowing much about it. LOVED IT. Raw, funny, insightful \\"first love\\" love story. I have a 14 year old daughter, who has been and a mother/child book group since she was in third grade. This will definitely be on our book group list.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have been using this app for awhile and love it. I find it easy to repin items and scroll through. I have never had any problems with this app. It is a great time killer :)
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Once again Hollywood insults the viewing public by trying to win them over with special affects alone. Everything from the directing the writing and the acting was sub-par at best. I had hoped for more but was left wanting.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl Strayed's ability to first walk the Pacific Crest Trail and then to describe what she experienced and how it changed her life is second to none.  I was with her from the day her boot flew over the abyss to the day she completed her dream.  I breathed the fresh mountain air, I drank in the images she painted of all that she saw, I was there with her!  In reality, I would never be courageous enough to attempt what she did.  She's honest and straightforward and I like her. Enjoyed the book from beginning to end and I wish her well!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I love the Reacher novels. This was just O.K. I look forward to new ones so maybe I just expect too much but I actually scimmed some of these pages whereas I generally don't want to miss a word.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|This is the best app I have! I am using it for my school notebooks, my schedule, and my personal notes. Handy Note is great!

B008KH8X2C|5.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2012 CD REISSUE ***<br /><br />\\"Against The Grain\\" is one of five new 2012 CD, Download and Vinyl reissues covering Rory Gallagher's 'studio' album period at Chrysalis Records between 1975 and 1979. His Polydor Label years (1971 to 1974) were released in full in January 2012 (see list below). The next set of studio and live album reissues are due in early 2013 - all supervised by Donal Gallagher - his brother, tour manager and keeper of the flame.<br /><br />So what's different? In a nutshell - cheaper price, restored artwork with upgraded packaging and 2012 remastering from the original tapes. Here are the finite details...<br /><br />Released 24 September 2012 in the UK (9 October 2012 in the USA) - \\"Against The Grain\\" is on Sony/Capo/Legacy 88725461492 and comes in a card digipak rather than a jewel case (49:28 minutes total playing time). The original vinyl album was released October 1975 in the UK and USA on Chrysalis CHR 1098 (it charted at number 121 in the States). \\"Against The Grain\\" marked his debut for the British label - and it was a proper belter.<br /><br />SOUND:<br />When \\"Against The Grain\\" was first re-issued on CD by Da Capo in February 1999 - the tapes were remixed and remastered by Tony Arnold - giving it a sound some found a little shrill. That first reissue also altered the original artwork in a terrible way.<br /><br />This time the original tapes have been returned to by ANDY PEARCE and MATT WORTHAM and remastered as 'untampered' versions in August 2012 at Wired Masters Studios in London - and little is going to prepare Gallagher fans for this. They've done a fantastic job. Right from the opening explosion of \\"Let Me In\\" - the sound is so full of power and incredible clarity - and stays that way to the end...<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />...And how good is to see the back of the dreadful artwork that blighted the 1999 reissue (in fact all 5 of the gatefold digipaks are gorgeous to look at - proper repros of the original LPs). The foldout 3-way inlay of old has been replaced in 2012 by a 12-page booklet with Donal Gallagher's song-by-song liner notes reproduced again. But as well as other colour photos - there's two new inclusions - CAMERON CROWE'S wonderful appraisal of Rory and the album from The Rolling Stone magazine in 1976 - and a review of the LP by SIMON FRITH in the same issue. The card digipak repros the lovely original album artwork (back and front), the CD itself is a picture disc and there's even a new photo beneath the see-through plastic tray. And priced at roughly a fiver sterling - this is a classy little reissue for not a lot of wonga.<br /><br />MUSIC:<br />The album was self-produced and featured the line-up that had been with him since \\"Blueprint\\" in 1973 - GERRY McAVOY on Bass, LOU MARTIN on Keyboards and ROD De'ATH on Drums. Rory covered everything else - Vocals, Guitars and Harmonica.<br /><br />The 10-track LP had 7 originals and three brilliantly chosen cover versions - Sam and Dave's Stax hit \\"I Take What I Want\\", Leadbelly's lonesome Blues \\"Out On The Western Plain\\" and a stunning slide guitar/harmonica working of \\"All Around Man\\" by Bo Carter of The Mississippi Sheiks (a 1930's Black Vocal Group Rory greatly admired).<br /><br />For me \\"Against The Grain\\" was the first 'studio' album to capture the sheer guitar-blast of Rory Gallagher 'live'. Even now the six-and-a-half-minute slide mayhem of \\"Souped-Up Ford\\" is absolutely astonishing - roaring out of your speakers like it's going to soil the furniture. He lets it rip - as does Lou Martin on keys - and it's hair-raising stuff. \\"Bought & Sold\\" may have referred back to the bitterness he still felt about the treatment of TASTE (his band) - but it was a chipper little rocker - and became a staple of his live set from 1975 onwards. \\"Lost At Sea\\" is unusual and a real grower - an almost Prog feel to the odd chord changes in it (fab clarity on the bass and drums). His acoustic take of Huddy Ledbetter's Cowboy song \\"Out On The Western Plain\\" is eerily clear - squeaking of chairs and strings - beautiful sound now. But I have to admit to a fave. I used to go to a Saturday night dance in Dublin in Clontarf called \\"The Grove\\" (there's a YouTube program on it done by RTE) where his joyous cover of Sam & Dave's \\"I Take What I Want\\" ended each Summer evening in a blaze of longhair and sweat. Yum yum...<br /><br />The two bonus tracks that ended the 1999 reissue reappear again too - \\"Cluney Blues\\" is a jaunty instrumental while \\"My Baby, Sure\\" is a Rockabilly tune with some great fun dialogue before it starts...<br /><br />For many - Rory's classic period was with Polydor Records in the early Seventies - and like so many fans - I adore those albums with a passion. But having just waded through all 5 of these 24 Sep 2012 reissues of his Chrysalis studio records - I'm absolutely blown-away by how good they are. While so many rock acts floundered (especially after 1975) - Rory just kept putting out one gem after another. If anything - I'm tempted to say that these albums are where his real genius lies.<br /><br />Like most Irishmen, I can't be rational about Rory Gallagher. I saw him and his band as a teenager live in Dublin in the early Seventies and the experience was mind-blowing (I'm actually in the audience at Dublin on Irish Tour '74). I then bought every album he ever put out after that and always looked forward to hearing where his flying fingers would take me next.<br /><br />Rory was sadly lost to us in 1995 through liver failure - and it still hurts to think that this most unassuming and brilliant of guitar heroes is gone. \\"Against The Grain\\" is a gem - and frankly \\"Calling Card\\" from 1976 is even better.<br /><br />Whole-heartedly recommended...and what a blindingly great player he was.<br /><br />PS: the titles in this 2011/2012 CD, Download and LP reissue series so far are:<br />1. \\"Rory Gallagher\\" (originally UK released in May 1971) - REVIEWED<br />2. \\"Deuce\\" (November 1971) - REVIEWED<br />3. \\"Live!

B0015AARJI|4.0|This is exactly what I wanted in a 2nd controller. Not some knock off, and for as of the time like $25 bucks off. Using it I find to be a little more disappointed though. The battery life seems to be terrible compared to the one I got off my PS3. No idea why, that's my only complaint.
B008KH8XRC|5.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2012 CD REISSUE ***<br /><br />\\"Photo-Finish\\" is one of five new 2012 CD, Download and Vinyl reissues covering Rory Gallagher's 'studio' album period at Chrysalis Records between 1975 and 1979. His Polydor Label years were released in full in January 2012 (see list below). The next set of studio and live album reissues are due in early 2013 - all supervised by Donal Gallagher - his brother, tour manager and keeper of the flame.<br /><br />So what's different? In a nutshell - cheaper price, restored artwork with upgraded packaging and 2012 remastering from the original tapes. Here are the finite details...<br /><br />Released 24 September 2012 in the UK (9 October 2012 in the USA) - \\"Photo-Finish\\" is on Sony/Capo/Legacy 88725461462 and comes in a card digipak rather than a jewel case (50:11 minutes total playing time). The original vinyl album was released October 1978 in the UK and USA on Chrysalis CHR 1170 (it charted at number 116 in the States) and was his 3rd studio LP for the British label - continuing on from the blisteringly good run of \\"Against The Grain\\" in 1975 and \\"Calling Card\\" in 1976.<br /><br />SOUND:<br />When \\"Photo-Finish\\" was first re-issued on CD by Da Capo in September 1998 - the tapes were remixed and remastered by Colin Failey and Tony Arnold - giving it a sound some found a little shrill. This time the original tapes have been returned to by ANDY PEARCE and MATT WORTHAM and remastered as 'untampered' versions in August 2012 at Wired Masters Studios in London. They've done a great job - the sound is very clear and muscular - still full of piss and vinegar for sure but less showy than before.<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />The foldout 3-way inlay of 1998 has been replaced with a 2012 12-page booklet that restores the original artwork. Donal Gallagher's song-by-song liner notes of old are reproduced again - but as well as colour photos - there's a new inclusion - David Fricke's article on the album in Circus Magazine from January 1979. The card digipak repros the lovely original album artwork (back and front), the CD itself is a picture disc and there's even a live photo beneath the see-through plastic tray. It looks the business and sounds great - and for fiver sterling - is a classy little reissue for not a lot of wonga.<br /><br />MUSIC:<br />Co-produced with Alan O'Duffy - for the album the band remained a three-piece with Gerry McAvoy on Bass and Ted McKenna on Drums while Rory covered everything else - vocals, guitars, harmonica and mandolin. His double tracking of electric lead (which began with \\"Against The Grain\\") added extraordinary power to many songs - the guitar solo on \\"Brute Force & Ignorance\\" for instance is just blistering - and now remastered to its full sonic potential. \\"Cruise On Out\\" sees him lashing into a fast one - screaming as he launches into a typically finger-licking solo. The lone cover - the traditional Delta blues of \\"Mississippi Sheiks\\" is turned into a slow paced Johnny Winter number - great stuff. The same applies to the chugging ZZ Top production given to the bluesy \\"Fuel To The Fire\\" - drums, bass and guitars - all sounding just blinding now (lyrics from it title this review). The two studio outakes that came with the 1998 reissue are here again - the rocking \\"Early Warning\\" and the jaunty acoustic/harmonica \\"Juke Box Annie\\"- both excellent and actually warranting the word `bonus'. All in all - a bit of a belter really...<br /><br />For many Rory's classic period was with Polydor Records in the early Seventies - and like so many fans - I adore those albums with a passion. But having just waded through all 5 of these 24 Sep 2012 reissues of his Chrysalis studio records - I'm absolutely blown-away by how good they are. While so many rock acts floundered (especially in the mid to late Seventies) - Rory just kept putting out one gem after another. If anything - I'm tempted to say that these albums are where his real genius lies. Playing back \\"Shin Kicker\\", \\"Cloak And Dagger\\" and \\"Last Of The Independents\\" is a rocking pleasure and not a nostalgia chore.<br /><br />Like most Irishmen, I can't be rational about Rory Gallagher. I saw him and his band as a teenager live in Dublin in the early Seventies and the experience was mind-blowing (I'm actually in the audience at Dublin on Irish Tour '74). I then bought every album he ever put out after that and always looked forward to hearing where his flying fingers would take me next.<br /><br />Rory was sadly lost to us in 1995 through liver failure - and it still hurts to think that this most unassuming and brilliant of guitar heroes is gone. \\"Photo-Finish\\" is a great way to remember him - and frankly the other 4 titles in this 2nd phase are pretty much the same.<br /><br />All five reissues are whole-heartedly recommened...<br /><br />PS: the titles in this 2011/2012 CD, Download and LP reissue series so far are:<br />1. \\"Rory Gallagher\\" (originally UK released in May 1971) - REVIEWED<br />2. \\"Deuce\\" (November 1971) - REVIEWED<br />3. \\"Live!

B008KH8X3Q|5.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2012 CD REISSUE ***<br /><br />\\"Top Priority\\" is one of five new 2012 CD, Download and Vinyl reissues covering Rory Gallagher's 'studio' album period at Chrysalis Records between 1975 and 1979. His Polydor Label years (1971 to 1974) were released in full in January 2012 (see list below). The next set of studio and live album reissues are due in early 2013 - all supervised by Donal Gallagher - his brother, tour manager and keeper of the flame.<br /><br />So what's different? In a nutshell - cheaper price, restored artwork with upgraded packaging and 2012 remastering from the original tapes. Here are the finite details...<br /><br />Released 24 September 2012 in the UK (9 October 2012 in the USA) - \\"Top Priority\\" is on Sony/Capo/Legacy 88725461452 and comes in a card digipak rather than a jewel case (46:40 minutes total playing time). The original vinyl album was released September 1979 in the UK and USA on Chrysalis CHR 1235 (it charted at number 56 in the UK and Number 140 in the States). \\"Top Priority\\" was his 4th studio LP for the British label - continuing on from the blisteringly good run of \\"Against The Grain\\" in 1975, \\"Calling Card\\" in 1976 and \\"Photo-Finish\\" in 1978.<br /><br />SOUND:<br />When \\"Top Priority\\" was first re-issued on CD by Da Capo in February 1999 - the tapes were remixed and remastered by Tony Arnold - giving it a sound some found a little shrill. That first reissue also altered the original artwork. This time the original tapes have been returned to by ANDY PEARCE and MATT WORTHAM and remastered as 'untampered' versions in August 2012 at Wired Masters Studios in London. They've done a great job - the sound is very clear and muscular - still full of piss and vinegar for sure but less showy than before. And the original white sleeve album artwork has been restored in the digipak and inner layout.<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />The foldout 3-way inlay of 1999 has been replaced with a 2012 12-page booklet with Donal Gallagher's song-by-song liner notes reproduced again. But as well as other colour photos - there's a new inclusion - Michael Davis' article on the album in Creem Magazine from January 1980. The card digipak repros the lovely original album artwork (back and front), the CD itself is a picture disc and there's even a repro live photo beneath the see-through plastic tray that appeared on the lone single issued off the album - \\"Philby\\". It looks the business and sounds great too - and for fiver sterling - is a classy little reissue for not a lot of wonga.<br /><br />MUSIC:<br />Like \\"Photo-Finish\\" before it - the album is again co-produced with Alan O'Duffy and the band a three-piece - Gerry McAvoy on Bass and Ted McKenna on Drums while Rory covered everything else - Vocals, Guitars, Harmonica and Dulcimer. All songs are RG originals and have a harder-hitting feel than previous outings. The guitar solo on the really strong opener \\"Follow Me\\" for instance is fantastic - and now remastered to its full string-screeching sonic potential (lyrics from it title this review). \\"Philby\\" sings of the infamous British spy Kim Philby and sees Rory play an unusual instrument - a 60's Coral Electric Sitar he borrowed from Pete Townshend. Both the fast \\"Wayward Child\\" and the stunning slow rocking of \\"Keychain\\" have guitar-playing on them that would many sit up and take notice - fab stuff. The frantic pace continues with the rip-roaring layers of \\"At The Depot\\" while the chugging \\"Bad Penny\\" is typically Rory - and became a huge live staple. A genuine blast is \\"Just Hit Town\\" which rocks like a monster and would give ZZ Top or Ted Nugent a run for their money. It ends in the bluesy \\"Off The Handle\\" which has a mean streak running through it and wild harmonica warbling and a tribute to a favourite B-movie of his youth \\"Public Enemy No.1\\". The two fast-paced studio outtakes \\"Hell Cat\\" and \\"The Watcher\\" that came with the 1999 version as 'bonus tracks' reappear here and are worthy rocking additions - even if the experimental vocal treatment on \\"The Watcher\\" doesn't quite work (and you can hear why it was left in the vaults).<br /><br />For many - Rory's classic period was with Polydor Records in the early Seventies - and like so many fans - I adore those albums with a passion.

B001F4TUCY|5.0|Thank you Natalie...the L.P.'s are wonderful.  Have you thought of a 20 year acoustic anniversary tour with just you and your guitarist? I would go. Please consider.
B004UID2LC|1.0|This app used to be wonderful, but hasn't worked for the last several months.  No longer able to download using any file type.
B00846REIS|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Can't wait for the second one. Similar to fifty shades of gray but different and I liked it better.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Jack showed himself to be a much better detective than one would expect of an ex Army MP officer. This was interesting and impressive but I missed the hard nosed frontier type justice we expect him to demonstrate with his fists.
034580404X|5.0|Decided to read the book since everyone was talking about it.  Glad I did.  Have read the first book and can't wait to start the 2nd one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great App that is easy to use.  Large buttons great for older people like me.  Would recommend to anyone needing a calculator.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a fun game.To me it is the best game ever,but I think it needs endearment, the heather, and mincarts.<br /><br />(submitted on 10-9-12)
B00846REIS|1.0|I can't even review this book properly and for what it is, without comparing it to FSOG. Similarities are not only obvious, but so there and in your face. Which gave me the impression that not even author is denying the fact that it's an attempt to make some extra buck from people who had a hangover after reading FSOG. And if you don't see that, you are either blind or you haven't read the FSOG.<br /><br />I can kind of understand why some of the people liked this book. The heroine in this story is not as annoying as in 50SOG. You don't see her constantly biting her lips, eye rolling and oh-my-ing. But for me, she is far from being likable. She had just the same amount of dislikable qualities about her as the other one, just in a different way. While some of the readers are saying that the woman in this story is stronger, more self secure and appears to be more mature, I could not be more disagree. First of all, she ran out on a Gideon just about the same amount of times as Anna on Christian. I don't see that as a sign of maturity. Second, sinse when being laund, abnoxious and dropping f-bombs in every sentence makes you mature?<br /><br />I got the impression that the roles in this book were reversed. While in the FSOG Chistian ran and Anna was chasing him, in this book Eva ran and Gideon was chasing her. I can understand why she found him fisicaly attractive, but I never understood what other inner qualities in him she saw, that made her want to actually be in a serious relationship with him. While Christian was FSO grey, darker and freed, Gideon was FSO-WTF??? And of course he owns manhattan, maybe even the whole New York City.<br /><br />And there is also Eva's roommate Steven (I think was his name). I think I liked him the most of all the characters, or maybe disliked him the least of all the characters, even though the fact that his almost every sentence started with \\"baby girl\\" annoyed me to death. I don't get it, why was it ok for Eva to laugh every time hetoled her about his new lay, and the fact that he was whoring around behind his boyfriends back. But when he got caught, she started to lecture him like mother Teresa, like she was shocked and didn't know that he was cheating on his boyfriend. What!? And what's with her crashing Gideon's family party 4 days after breaking up with him, like it was no big deal and everybody does that? When Gideon asked her why she came, she said she did it for Steven, because it was important for his carrier. Uhm... Crazy much? Oh, speaking of crazy, his mother sized her up like a monkey and first question out of her mouth was \\"Is that your natural hair color?\\"<br /><br />I could go on and on, but bottom line is, you can't call this book original and say you have never read anything like it. But the main reason I'm giving it 1 star is not because the story is similar to FSOG, but because I don't have respect for authors who takes someone else's work, rewrites it, with some minor changes and publishes as their own!
0817439390|5.0|I have a number of books on photography that I bought in an attempt to help develop my artistic side of photography. It has been a real challenge to find good books on developing personal style and expressing my photos in a different artistic way in contrast to the many excellent photographers out there. Technically I am very experienced so it was very interesting to me how much this \\"technical\\" book addressed my requirement to develop more on the artistic side. This book is well written and the author gives excellent practical advice that you can apply immediately to enhance your images. I suppose for me this book relaxed me so much that I can now just let myself be creative. I would really recommend this book!
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved it . The first book is a bit graffic, but once you get to the second one , it becomes a great love story.
B0086700CM|1.0|they need to make this game easier to play because it just ran and turned and did the stuff on its own
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie is great.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the lack of \\"back story\\" and character development that is present in the book.
B005NK69ZC|5.0|[[ASIN:0446585041 Seriously...I'm Kidding]]<br />I read the book on the way to work every day, I couldn't help myself but laugh out loud (you just cannot hold it back). People must think I am so weird! Sometimes I read it in my bedroom, my mum thought I had lost my mind (from laughing and crying at the same time). If you want a laugh on one of those \\"shooty\\" day, buy it(it really can fix things). For those people who don't have a scene of humor, buy it(you might find your hidden potential). Anyway love you Ellen!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Recommend to everyone who enjoy the hidden object puzzle games! I could not put down and was very addicting!  Not an easy game which I enjoyed but can use hint if you get stuck.
B0000266T2|2.0|The audio on this CD is terrible (\\"tinny\\", low volume setting) I notice that it's imported from Austria, so perhaps the imported CD's have to be more carefully controlled.  I see \\"imported\\" more and more on product descriptions.
0345803493|4.0|You will have to read this if you read the first and you won't be dissappointed. There is no way to stop once you have started this series. Its enjoyable but kinduv leaves you wanting more.
B008XG1X18|4.0|wish I didn't have to unistall then reinstall this app on my kindle every time I try to use it on my kindle. I have no problems with this app on my phone. love it beside this little problem.
0345803507|4.0|Followed right after the first book. Just as sexy, started to ge a little corny at the end. If you read the first you really should finish the series.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|i love this game its like temple run but cuter characters and the obsricals aree much funner it so good
B008G8SFGO|1.0|Monster could have been great, but it suffers from horrible production, another victim of the loudness wars. Even with Gene and Paul trying to erase Ace and Peter from Kisstory, I wanted to give this cd a fair chance; my earlier review was written after 1 listen, but it took a couple more to realize what is wrong with the cd, other than being another vitim of the loudness wars, it's rather dead sounding. Mr Stanley should have allowed an outside producer like Bob Rock. I stand by my 1 star rating. I should never have gkven it 5 stars. No album with fake ace and fake peter can ever be a 5 star album or even a 3 star album for that matter
B008PE9GSA|5.0|Gentlemen, I am sure we all are not new to ZZ Top music. If you are a new fan, than I would definitely refer other albums of ZZ Top that are more consistent from start to finish. However if you are an old fan like me owning every album of ZZ Top than read this:<br />1. All tracks are not very new to the ears however they are new different tunes of ZZ Top and I love it<br />2. ZZ Top are very much back to base in their songs and display Gibbons guitar very nicely<br />3. The guitar sound is amazingly good on all tracks<br />4. I am 55 years old, ZZ Top are surely in their 60's. They are playing as if they were still 30. Respect to that. These gentlemen makes me feel young and I salute them<br />Buy this album if you are an old fan like me. YOU will not regret in one bit
B000009HF2|5.0|Woowie Zowie! This recording is still fantastic 30+ years down the line. Clean, bright - just plain enjoyable! \\"Do you feel, do you feel like I do...?\\" If you want to start over with a fresh, clean version of this double CD, Amazon came up with good prices.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love browsing this app. No problems whatsoever. I could go through this getting ideas for absolutely anything. Love love love it.
B008CJ0KI8|4.0|I'm a middle aged guy who pretty much gave up on R&B after hearing way too much hip-hop boom with the vo-coder overload and not enough reason, rhythm or brain matter for that matter. Then on a recommendation, I popped this in. After a few tracks, I suddenly had faith in R&B again. Better yet, the album holds a strength of intelligence and atmosphere that is unfortunately very rare today.<br /><br />The songs range from simple to intricate, but always seem sincere and without pretension (another rarity). Sierra Leone caught me first with it's solo call/response intro that yields to several plateaus of groove gently pushed along by a heavy breath. This took me into Sweet Life, which has a slight Stevie Wonder flavor but is clearly his own. \\"Lost\\" sticks out as a great danceable groove.<br /><br />Some of the lines are incredible gems, like Sierra Leone's \\"I've been spending too much time alone, and I just ran out of Trojans\\", or Sweet Life's \\"My TV aint HDTV, that too real for me\\", and they just keep coming.<br /><br />There's definitely some hype driving this. And that's probably because R&B hasn't had an adventurous gift like this in years. There may be a few weak spots, but this is definitely an album of substance.<br /><br />Keep it coming Frank.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|the game isn't terribly complicated but I'm finding myself playing regularly. coins regenerate even when it's not running and it tells you when you'll have a full coin count again. the prizes and puzzles keep it interesting and I'm looking forward to the additional puzzles after I finish the coin drop one.
B0052RDHTM|1.0|I made a big mistake to buy this book. So boring. I am stuck about 100 pages down the road. Do not think I will ever finish.<br /><br />jan<br /><br />PS.: Others might think different :-)
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is very raw. If you're expecting anything other than Mommy Porn you're probably going to be disappointed. That said, as long as you take it as face value its an absolute pleasure to read. E.L. James is very descriptive and knows the right words to 'entrance' her audience. I couldn't put these books down.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I found Winter of the World enjoyable.  It was not one of Follet's best efforts,but was well written and pretty much a page turner.  I would recommend the trilogy, the first two have been worth reading.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|Had problems with the 3D on the DVD,  Got it exchanged with no problems,  Enjoyed the movie, but the 3D was not that much to be desired.  Have seen better 3D.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|Just saw Act of Valor and loved the movie. I didn't see any of the negatives expressed by the<br />commie movie critics. You could tell these were real Seals in the action scenes, trained to perfection. I was really thankful to get that close to the real Seal action.<br />Highly recommend this movie to any patriot!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|The best feature of this app for me is having so many versions at my fingertips.  I am limited only by needing a wifi connection for most of them, but even that is not much of an issue any more.  Great features, great app.

B004W25KKW|3.0|The book is a nice read, but I did not come away with a feeling that I have some additional practical knowledge on how to approach and improve my memory. It is a nice read if you like so called anecdote and stories about people involved in the memory circuit.

B007ZXK08C|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn until the last few pages when I was left a bit empty by the ending. It's such a pity such an excellent book ended on a bit of an anti-climax. I'd like to try one of Gillian Flynn's other books to see how it compares.
B002JCSWVG|1.0|After seeing this movie last night I can now better understand what was going on with Eastwood at his latest \\"big event.\\" It appears he has finally lost it.<br /><br />This movie is a great idea and the true story is a great story, but this movie stinks, and I hate to say that because I am both a big Eastwood fan and a big Mat Damon fan.<br /><br />The movie looks more like a made-for-tv movie than a major motion picture, the lighting, the sets and the costumes are all poorly done.<br /><br />The script is more like a rough draft and it seems to lead one to believe Nelson Mandela's only concern was rugby. What a massive trivialization of a very important world event!!!<br /><br />Damon attempts to do his best with a character who is meant to be important to the movie but without any character developmnet and even less good lines.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is given little to work with from the script and his accent is poor at best.<br /><br />The worst thing about the movie is the direction. This is Eastwood's worst film. It looks like it was directed by an adult movie director with a low budget. Uninspired. Uninspired. Uninspired.<br /><br />I hate to say it but I am guessing Eastwood will not be making any more great films. I hope I am wrong but this film is more than just not that good, it is a failure on every level.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|While not as popular with my boys as Cars, Ratatouille is a great alternative when they have exhausted themselves on Lightning McQueen.  Though that does not happen all that often.  A very cute movie, though for adults it does get a little disturbing contemplating a rat cooking your food in a restaurant.  haha.  Your kids will love this, this is typical Disney Pixar pay dirt.  However, if it is a choice between this and Cars and you are shopping for boys, go with Cars.  That will get them every time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it play all the time not as good as computer update equal to computer ad sneeking best pocket game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JNS0|5.0|This movie never disappoints my kids, who have watched it at least 100 times.  This is actually our second copy of the movie, as the first one skips in parts due to so much use and handling by little hands.  My son calls this one \\"The Dancing Cars\\" because of the \\"Life is a Highway\\" segment.  Your kids, especially boys, will not be disappointed.  If you have a choice between \\"Cars\\" and \\"Cars 2\\" I'd definitely go with this one.  While we enjoyed Cars 2, it spends a little too much time on the whole \\"Oil Companies Are BAD!\\" theme for my liking.  This one is just straight up children's entertainment with no overt agenda.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|No, it's Not Destroyer!!, No it's Not Creatures Of the Night, No it's not Revenge, hell!! it's not even Psycho Circus,  but Monster does deliver what the band promised it would, this album definitely almost captures that 70's sound, using analog equipment, (however can't not be duplicated without Ace Frehley, no offence to Tommy Thayer though), but it is a definite improvement from Sonic Boom, which I thought was a great album with some problems, the problems on SB to start, Paul Stanley's songs we great and well written, but his voice was not up to par, fortunately he had surgery on his voice, and it helped on Monster a lot, and For Gene Simmons on SB his singing was great, but for a guy who once could write some great innuendo lyrics, he wrote some of the most lame songs on that album (\\"Nobody's perfect....so just take off your clothes\\",How Original Gene) , but this time he went back to lyric lessons 101 and wrote a little more intelligent lyrics this time, this album does rock, and is not boring at all, some of you will love this, some of you won't, but this album is fresh, I don't care much for the cover considering Paul said it would have a Destroyer like cover,and it looks more like the cover of their tour programs. But the band does deliver a solid album, and one I will continue to enjoy, ( especially listening to this while doing a hardcore self ass kickin at the gym.)

I have never had a problem buying from Amazon and will continue to shop with them.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|just like playing at the game room on the boardwalk when I kid.  I would recommend it to my friends.
B008LZHA3G|2.0|Some OK songs but many are not up to his past standards. His voice used to have character but has deteriorated and is just gravelly.
B007V0Q8HQ|5.0|I've read reviews of this album (which I own) and a lot of people complain about the rapping. The rap is most apparent in \\"Broken Arrow\\" (my favorite track). The rap isn't grating to me (Mark Sheehan is a good rapper). It's definitely not amateurish. And it's rap that doesn't denigrate nor does it promote or glorify juvenile behavior. Listen to \\"If You Could See Me Now\\"; it is a heartfelt song that draws on O'Donoghue's loss (he lost his father during the production of their debut album, if I'm not mistaken), it's evocative, poignant, and a standout track on the album. It makes my eyes water (especially the bridge:  \\"Would you call me a saint or a sinner? Would you love me a loser or winner? When I see my face in the mirror, we look so alike that it makes me shiver..\\"), and when an artist can elicit that type of response from a listener, they're doing something right. This album is not a deviation from the path that has brought them hitherto. Anyone familiar with The Script knows of their versatility, and that includes incorporating elements from other genres into their music. This is an album brimming with visceral emotion. And shoutout to Glen Power, awesome drumming and vocals, as usual!

B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is really cool! It tells you how much time you have left to browse the web, watch videos, listen to music, and more! Also, if you have a problem with your charger and cant tell when your device is charging or not, this app will show up everytime it starts charging! It's great!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Easy to use.  Fun to play.  I haven't had any problems with the game.  Beware, though, it can become addictive!
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Quite different storyline than the book.  Written in the future, with flashbacks to the past.  Even so, it is a great adaptation, and effectively conveys the morale of the original story.  Buy it !
B0042FZOFU|5.0|Great deal for the trilogy! I couldn't believe how fast I got them over mail. I would recommend it!  Exceeded expectations.
B00943SQCI|5.0|I really liked the movie!  I thought it was creative, funny, and a little dark at the same time.  I highly recommend it!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|If I could give this game 10 stars I would. the puzzles are just enough challenge to keep you interested and the music is very soothing. my favorite app game by far. I play this while waiting for doctors appointments and I don't have to turn down the sound because everyone likes the music. well done!
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Enter another ripley.plot easy to grasp,visual effects good.noomi rapace roll was a surprisingly great switch.prometheus should've been the very first intro to alien.sure to be a part2 and maybe room for 3.
B009NPKTN6|2.0|I watched this movie because I was on a flight to India.  I actually expected it to be decent.  Not great, but ok.  It wasn't.  The music was distracting, it didn't add to the overall story.  I liked the songs, but they seemed to take away from the story, which was lackluster at best.  The two leads were annoying.  I love Alex Baldwin, but his bad wig was so ridiculous I couldn't take the role seriously. It was hard to tell if they were trying to make it a parity or trying to take themselves seriously.  The only good thing in the movie was Tom Cruise.  When he came on the screen and in all his scenes, he brought the movie to an all new level.  He is the only reason to watch this movie.  A good example of how a great actor can still be great in a really bad movie.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|WOW!!! I'm in love! Gideon is fabulous in a hot, sexy, alpha way. I loved Bared to You and waited months for this book. I must say it was worth the wait. I enjoyed this book better than the first. The relationship between Eva and Gideon is tumultuous and steamy. I can't get enough, give me more!!! I can't wait for the next book in this series.
B00943SQCI|2.0|This was a painful movie to sit through.  I watched it on a flight.  I love Johnny Depp, but this was a bad movie.  The timing was slow, it was hard to follow and there was no emotional investment in any of the characters.  It also was not funny.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This was not only my first Jillian Michaels dvd, but also my first workout dvd. I did the full 30 days and had great results. However, as a beginner I would suggest pacing yourself and taking more than one day per week off. I started out full force and ended up hurting my shoulder and having to take a week off. But aside from my overdoing it, this was a great program. It was hard at first, but you an tell how much you improve over time. I find Jillian to be very motivating, although I also hate her at times. Since finishing 30 day shred, I have bought most of Jillians other dvds, and find myself returning to 30ds often.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|So excited to see Bradley Cooper in this role! Loved reading the book! Now if only Amazon could send him in the mail!
B008X8QCTO|4.0|as the others have stated you can choose to pay .99 more to do the bonus chapter but it pops up earlier in the game so it is a bit misleading. however, paying $2 for this game was totally worth it. i love this type of game and it wasnt really difficult or super easy so it was a good time waster :)
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I loved this movie when I saw it in the theater, could hardly wait for the DVD. I have watched it twice since I received it. I kept the Blu Ray copy and sent the other one to my son, as he hadn't seen it! So we both enjoyed it. this movie is worth watching several times.
1609611543|4.0|The author supported his theory that the modern hyprid versions of wheat is unhealthy. I have read quite a lot about celiac disease over the past 2 years from different sources and found this author gives the reader the same information.  I have also read from different sources the danger of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome and found this author's findings similiar.  There are 3 members of my family who have been diagnosed with celiac via endoscopy and blood work.  I addition  2 members who have decided to be wheat free this past month and both have told me how much better they feel overall.  I am working on being wheat free also [[ASIN:1609611543 Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health]]
0307950689|4.0|I am not going to repeat what over 1000 people have said. Look at how split the ratings are. That should tell you a lot about the reaction to this book.<br />I loved it because I love symbolism and historical facts. The book is full of interesting facts about Washington D.C. monuments and buildings and the symbolism in a few of them. I loved all the Masonic and related sybolism and ritual. I do not have to believe it to be interested.<br />I hated whole sections however. I agree with the Lee review - too much thrown in without good editing. Most of the ending should have been thrown out as overblown. I felt that I was reading an overdone and tedious religion lecture that did not serve the story. The story was over; the wrap of details should have taken far less pages. I also agree that the transitions between places and the details of every twist and turn are a little overdone. There is a version of this book that has maps which would have helped this version.<br />The good vs. evil formula has been overdone in Browns' books. Langdon always solves the mystery and saves the day with the narrowest of margins and there is always a girl to give it a bit of adventure.<br />The villian - a little surprising. Interesting until the end. I found the CIA director a little too weird, but in a place as paranoid as Washington, the character was plausible.<br />Overall I found it a page turner, but in some places I was skimming the pages and turning them without interest and in other places I could not put it down and did not want to stop.<br />I would recommend it if your liked Angels and Demons and Da Vinci Code. If you did not like those books, you won't like this one.

B00782O7IY|5.0|the best of firms.  five stars.  this is really an excellent firm. always desirous to please and make things perfect/  highly recommended.
1423140605|5.0|There are no spoilers in this review, so you can rest easy.<br /><br />Ok, I hate to give a book five stars because no book is perfect, but it wouldn't feel right giving this four. I read a review that said that the book should have been longer because it had seven awesome characters in it, and that it was rushed. I disagree. Mark of Athena was exactly the length it was supposed to be. This book wasn't about Leo, or Piper or even Percy. This was Annabeth's story. I snorted when I read Rick Riordan described it like that because I didn't think he could pull that off with Percy nearby. Perhaps alone, I thought.<br /><br />And that's what happened.<br /><br />In a sense, every chapter but Annabeth's were fillers--entertaining fillers, sure, but fillers all the same. I admit that Percy and Piper underwent character development. I thought it was impossible for me to come to like Piper's chapters and love Percy more than I did. Rick Riordan just proved me wrong. For the first time, I rooted for Piper. If you didn't like Piper in the Lost Hero, you have a better chance of liking her here. We also saw a very different side of Percy. I could understand his fears and I never thought that Gaea almost drowning him would have such far-reaching effects. Ok, when I put it that way it sounds like a very traumatizing experience, but son of the sea god, anyone?<br /><br />We get to the bottom (or what I assume is the bottom) of the Sammy/Hazel/Leo mystery. We get to know what happened to the grey streaks from the Titan's Curse.<br /><br />The ending, I assure you, is beautiful. You wont be disappointed. Halfway through the book, I was thinking how I thought it would be impossible for Rick Riordan to pull off a better ending in this book than he achieved in Son of Neptune. Oh, he managed to surprise me very much. This book is as deserving of the five stars more than any other book I've ever read. I thought that the first series was Percy's coming-of-age books, but this is taking it toa new level. I think that all of the narrators underwent character development. Maybe Jason did a little, too.<br /><br />If you liked the first series, but stopped reading after getting halfway though Lost Hero and decided you couldn't stand the new characters, finish it and make your way to Mark of Athena. It's worth it.
0553378384|5.0|A lot of good information for your soul understanding of the universe on an intimate level. I have read many books on astrology & there is always something new to learn.<br />Thank you Jan.
0525953728|5.0|Great, non-sensational, description of a Seal's life, and a graphic description of the Team that killed Osama bin Laden.  The matter-of-fact and realistic telling of what it takes to be a Seal leads authority to the writer.  I shared the Seal outrage when administration sources revealed the identity of the unit that raided the bin Laden compound.  At the time, I felt sure that what we all saw on television in the days following the raid, would turn out to cause a serious safety concern for the team members and their families. That the folks in the administration didn't know better, shows their disconnect from the lives of our warriors.<br /><br />I hope many, many Americans will read this book and learn the truth.
B008ANFRG6|3.0|Besides a few tracks I find Vai's latest release difficult to listen to.  Most of the tracks seem to be exercises in academia without a purpose, and I have been a life long Vai fan.  I actually did enjoy John the Revelator to a degree but the Broadway treatment at the end really seems to stick out like a sore thumb.  Gravity Storm is a fun guitar track with some grinding soulful riffage.<br /><br />I understand where Vai, as a songwriter is coming from, trying to infuse his sense of modern composition, theater, and rock/metal, but this release seems like a meandering and confusing collection of songs that sounds to me, like unfinished demos.<br /><br />Another nit pick on my end is the production.  I have never been a fan of how Vai mixes drums, usually sounding like an afterthought and on most tracks, the humanness is squeezed out of them with compression and eq.  Some of the synth work seems to stick out like they are out of some old Casio synth from 1988, but then maybe that is what he was going for.<br /><br />If this is the direction Mr. Vai is going in, then I wish him luck.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I was so disappointed!!! I didn't like the up and down back and forth. I have to say the book upset me at times as well. So bummed!I wanted more of the last book. I almost gave up reading the book all together.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's a rare book (nevermind series) that catches my attention immediately and keeps it throughout. This series has done exactly that.<br /><br />It's well-written, compelling, and leads the reader on an ever-spiraling trail of mystery that turns out to be every bit as interesting as one could hope.<br /><br />Beyond that I like the writing style and characters and could easily see this becoming a movie series with little plot modification necessary. I'll keep my fingers crossed!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|good game. started out too slow. once it got going it was addictive. wish there was a way to finish the game. there is NO WAY to earn enough dozed dollars to upgrade all the prize levels. even though I finished the puzzle I would have kept playing till all prize levels were complete. maybe being able to sell coins to get dollars.
B00447L4JG|5.0|Very happy with it. It has been watched about 6 times already and all is good with it :) Came packaged well and no problems.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|its fun.  .  makes me &quot;think outside the box&quot;.  I thought it would be a child's game but its a challenge for adults.
0316228532|4.0|This is by no means a children's book, which I think we have established.  This is also a very British book.  Most may not understand some of the slang used (especially by the more 'lower-class' characters) unless you understand British slang and culture very well.  If you have seen the TV series Skins, then I imagined it to be similar, only there is a lot more adult character attention and politics.<br /><br />Without spoiling too much, the main topics in the book are politics, drug addiction, death, teenage frolics, sex, and plenty of language to suit them.  At first I thought Rowling was over-using bad language to set this book far apart from Harry Potter, but in the end I decided the use of harsh or shocking language was to appropriate to emphasize the characters personalities.  Without it, you may mis-judge them.<br /><br />Rowling's writing is still very good.  Despite the main plot subject matter, she was still able to keep my attention with her great similes and metaphors, that often elicit a chuckle or two.  The humor is not overbearing, and woven in, leaning more toward dark comedy.  Be ready to meet a lot of characters within the first chapters.  It was a little confusing at first, and by the end I still got a couple mixed up, but I was able to figure out who was who.  The book is steady, and you may have a hard time connecting with the characters at first.  As events start to unfold, you should begin to like them for who they are.  I don't agree with some reviews that I read that said they were completely hollow or unlikeable.<br /><br />Eventually, the story builds up to a climactic and shockingly sad ending, which I thought was very Skins-esque in that it is very hard hitting, dramatic, and sombre, but also very real.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|I am a big fan of Lee Child's books and I can say that I have read all his books to date and I enjoyed all of them. In a nut shell, they are inteligent, thorough, realistic and based on an excellent research. I am just surprised that I have not heard of any movies made of his novels yet ...I am already looking forward to his next book starring Jack Reacher.
B000TGJ7ZY|4.0|decadent costumes and sets that make the movie worth watching and rewatching. Plot is good, kinda lags during the second half. As to how faithful it is to the novel, can't say, haven't read it. Entertaining film, perfect sexy story for Halloween.
0375505091|3.0|I found it very difficult to rate this magnificent volume.It is a huge,heavy,hardcover,coffee table book,of 472 pages ,10.4 X 13.6 inches  and weighs close to 8 pounds.It's interesting to look at the reviews already posted and note there are many helpful votes given to both reviews that rate the book 5*'s as well as those which rate it 4*'s,3*'s, 2*'s and 1*;and very good reasons given for the ratings.<br /> I enjoy fine pgotography and Annie Liebovitz is one of the finest of the finest.<br /> This book has some of her great photographs of famous people and give a small representation of her great artistry in capturing the people involved.For example,her portrait of Willie Nelson ,done in 2001 ,is in my humble opinion,the finest portrait of him that I have ever seen.As far as I am concerned, there is far too little of her great work in this book.<br /> Obviously,showing her great work over the years was secondary with this book.The purpose was to show Annie Leibovitz's personal life,friends,family and loves.It shows much of the personal sadness of the loss of friends;and unfourtunately shows very little in the way of happiness by any of her inner circle.One can only come to the conclusion from going through this collection ,that there was very little happiness in her life,in spite of her great skills and fame.<br /> While Annie's skills are magnificent when she produces portraits of famous people;there is little of it in the photography about her personl life.In fact,most fall in the realm of snapshots.<br /> If that is what interests one about this talented artist,then you will be one who will rate the book highly.If ,it's her great portraits you like;you may simply feel that the book is primarily a lot of snapshots,many about people who mean very little to you.It's almost like looking aat family snapshots of strangers.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend a year ago, when he was just starting to take up running.  After consistently running 5K and 10K races, he announced that he wanted to do a marathon. I did a lot of research and Garmin seemed to have the best product on the market at that time.<br /><br />He's pretty good with electronics, but had a bumpy start with the watch. It has a lot of cool features, but not all of them are as intuitive or user friendly as we thought they would be when first learning the features. After reading the instructions several times, watching some helpful \\"how to\\" videos on YouTube and checking with other Garmin users, he was finally up and running with the watch.<br /><br />The GPS tool is fabulous, and the lap splits tracking is one of his favorite features. Being able to download his run information wirelessly to his laptop has been motivating and exciting for him, so he can see his progress history and where he needs to do more work.<br /><br />He just finished running the Chicago Marathon this year, and did very well. He credits much of his success to being able to train with the Garmin watch.  For us, it's a winning product all the way around, and my guy is already planning his next marathon and plans to use the watch to better his overall time.

0525478817|5.0|Full review on Reader's Dialogue: [...]  Hazel and Augustus are both really likable characters. Yes, they're weird. But in the best way possible, in a way that takes a horrible thing like terminal cancer and makes it secondary to the life they're living now, to the pressing, important issues that completely overshadow cancer - like what happens to the hamster in An Imperial Affliction. Because how could Hazel die without knowing that? By the way - Sisyphus as a name for a hamster? Brilliant. But seriously - if not for the constant reminder of Hazel's tubes and Augustus's leg, I might have forgotten at some points that these are sick teens. Which is kind of the point.    Right from the start, it's obvious that Hazel is frustrated at how the cancer took hold of her life and dominates every move she makes, and every decision her family makes. So when she begins living a life where cancer is peripheral, when she lets herself love and doesn't worry - too much - about how having cancer fits with having a boyfriend, it changes everything. Her mother is happy about it - though why she pulled Hazel out of school when she just wants her to continue having normal interactions with people is beyond me. That's not a criticism of the author. To the contrary, I think it sounds perfectly realistic, and it made me think about how people react to illness. Hazel's mom is so afraid of things that she reacts that way, but when Hazel starts changing things, her mom does too.    For me, there were two parts to the book. The first, more obvious, part is the exploration of how people deal with illness and death. There's a large enough cast of characters besides Hazel and Augustus's families that we get to see more than a few reactions. And the book is just peppered with pithy comments and observations about life, about death, about humanity's place in the universe.    But the other part that I connected to just as much is the exploration of what a book is, what a novelist is. Green prefacesthe novel with a note about how everything in the novel is made up and readers shouldn't try to search for facts in it. And then Hazel is obsessed with finding out what happens to the characters after the end of An Imperial Affliction. And the way that turns out seems to be a comment on the essence of novels and novelists, following from this preface. I love how Hazel's quest to find out the ending turns out. It winds up affecting both parts of the book, the exploration of novels as well as the exploration of death and dying.    With all its serious subject matter, The Fault in Our Stars manages to be - not exactly fun, but close to it. Definitely it has some laugh-out-loud moments. And some teary ones, but they're balanced. It's a beautiful love story, in the larger sense of love.
B00846REIS|5.0|I can understand why some felt like this was similar to \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\", but I didn't think so. It has a similar feel to it, with some similar concepts, but the characters are different, with different stories and overall the relationship was unique. I truly enjoyed this book. I would have to say I enjoyed this story more. I feel like the sex scenes were well-placed without being too much. The story between the characters was able to take precedence over the sex. But there was still plenty of that!
B004G8Y0D0|3.0|Sometimes you just want a movie that is fun and packed with action.  No redeeming value. A-Team meets those qualifications.
B0027MJU00|3.0|This was an easy read. Not a good as Gone Girl. But, I enjoyed it. A little bit violent for my taste but in the genre of the story I understand why the author had to go there.
B0031TZASY|4.0|I didn't read Life of Pi when it first came out because I didn't think I would enjoy the subject matter.  I didn't realize that it was a book about spirituality and love, which IS a subject matter that very much interests me.  I say give it a try if you're not sure.  You might be pleasantly surprised as I was.
B007Q0OV6Q|4.0|I am not going to go over everything you get in this advent calendar as it's been said before...except...Santa Darth Maul and Snowman R2-D2.  Awesome.  I mean, come on!  This is so much fun to open up.  My kids are so excited for it.  But...not awesome enough for the cost.  This is a real shame because there is nothing more fun for my family than the Lego advent calendars.  I have bought it this year...but...I am feeling frustrated by what you get for the price.  My daughter and husband love Star Wars...so this is a no-brainer, but due to the cost it is getting 3 stars.  If it was reasonably priced, this would definitely be a 5 star item.<br /><br />***Edit***  I have changed my 3 star rating to 4, now that we have used it for a few days, so much fun, the kids are so excited every morning.
0802473156|5.0|I ordered this book just for the heck of it while browsing, not expecting much. I'm not that into 'self-help' literature to begin with, but figured why not give it a try, who knows, I might learn something.<br /><br />Well, boy did I learn a few things!<br /><br />First off, the book is divided into sections according to topic or personality, which makes it extremely easy to navigate through (if you'd want to skip to a relevant part).<br />Secondly, it was very interestingly written, and the analogies used to explain complicated topics made it all the more appealing, because we all know that different trials in a relationship (and the causes of it) are really not that easy to grasp or comprehend, let alone FIX.<br />And thirdly, the author, being a couple's counsellor, shares clients' experiences and personal testimonials in regards to their marital troubles, which on numerous occasions while reading the book made me go: \\"AHA, i recognise that! And look, the next paragraph deals with the solution!\\"<br /><br />This book opened my eyes to ALOT of things I hadn't thought about before, in terms of wrong-goings and wrong-doings in relationships. It explained alot of really BASIC things that might seem obvious upon reading them, but that people surely overlook (I know I did).<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to anyone and everyone, trouble in paradise or not! It's a really interesting read and you will finish it feeling more enlightened for sure!
B000009HF2|5.0|This double album is a gotta have for a rocker. Such great tunes that have stood the test of time. I also recommend his 1999 Detroit concert.
0446693804|5.0|Just like most or shall I say ALL of Nicholas Sparks' books, this one was no exception in terms of an easy, touching read.<br />I enjoy his books alot; they're like reading the story instead of watching the (often lame & cheesy) movie.<br />If you want a good solid 'real life' story, wonderfully written, this is the book for you.<br />It was a page-turner and I must have finished it by the end of one saturday on my couch!
B0025KVLT2|5.0|Beatles Rubber Soul is one of the greatest albums. A musical treasure. And when you consider these 4 guys rushed the album, even better!
0345803507|5.0|The book was awsome! loved every minute of it.  The story line was a page turner and the characters were easy to love and relate to. I would love to read more from this author.
159420411X|5.0|I have followed Nate Silver and Fivethirtyeight since mid 2008 and have come to respect him very much as a forecaster and reported. This book was as exceptional as I had hoped it would be and is a fun, easy read that can provide you with great insight. (Unless you unfortunately discover, as I did, that you're a hedgehog and not a fox.)<br /><br />The book is not the least bit dry or boring and is eye opening in a number of ways. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone, even if they don't think they're interested in statistics or politics.
0345803493|5.0|After reading 50 Shades of Grey, I had to read the all of the books. Loved the story line and the characters. I would love to read more from this author.

B009B2U73I|2.0|I own 8 cd's of Diana Krall even a live DVD of a concert in Paris. I don't have this one I was at a friends today and listening to it and I had planned to purchase this cd. I listened to it several times and this to me is the worse cd of her career. It never takes off, one song after another with no real lyrics and you never want to hit the repeat button to listen to a particular song again. After listening it was such a let down after buying all of her other recordings. Hope that she reads the reviews here and come back to the way she use to make music.

B005LAIHXQ|4.0|All I have is one single, simple DVD of Prometheus, so that is all I can review or would even try to. Naturally I am interested in the production, the direction and the acting, and of course I was hoping for great things in the department of camera-work and special effects. However what I am rating this film on is one thing more than all the rest put together - the story.<br /><br />That is not quite the same thing as the `plot', which I can tell you would not get four stars from me. I mean, these intrepid boldly-goers take the most irresponsible risks you could imagine. One of them is an android, sure, and he probably is the worst offender, but that is only because he is operating in obedience to His Master's Voice, and the master is another human being. Not only that, he is a business tycoon who seems to have been totally unsupervised by anyone supposedly given responsibility for protecting the rest of us. Business deregulation is all very well within rational limits, I dare say, but even now in 2012 we are all too aware of what some financial interests did to us and what they nearly did when we took our eye off them. That was only money, I suppose, but what this well-spoken old English geezer is playing with is the very survival of humanity to satisfy his own moribund curiosity, which seems to bother nobody. I shall not complain about the general scenario of interstellar travel being a fait accompli within this century, within my grandchildren's lifetime on a reasonable actuarial basis, because without that I would not have my treasured story at all. However I must protest about the collision between the spacecraft. In the context of the threatened apocalypse, and considering the power that these interstellar ships must have packed, this climactic scene is downright tame. Think of the wreck of the Hindenburg.<br /><br />Still, the story gave me most of what I was looking for. The original Alien was found aboard an abandoned spaceship of unknown provenance or destination. That film was followed with three sequels, each in my opinion weaker than the one before. All the time I craved information regarding that sinister craft, and I have got it at last. Whether the craft's mission was one I might have expected I'm not sure because I had no clear ideas about that, but what we have here is a good old sci-fi yarn, of the kind I am old enough to enjoy because I have read so many of them. It tells us the origin of our race, which is rather an unexciting origin, humanity on earth being no more than a modified version of some other pre-existing beings, hailing from somewhere else but exactly like us only bigger.<br /><br />Right at the end guess which old friend puts in a cameo appearance: I shall mask its identity subtly behind the abbreviation A...n. What goes along with this is the clear promise of further sequels, and these I shall make a point of surviving long enough to watch, because the heroine and the robot commandeer a spare spaceship to head off into the realm where our deep-space ancestors really originated. Her interest in this is curiosity again, I suppose, but this time of a more reputable kind, given what she has been through, than the old moneybags had.<br /><br />The acting is not exactly Oscars stuff, and the script is a bit wooden in places, especially near the start, but it is not bad in general. The special effects department do very well, as you would expect. As in Alien, there are some fine creepy sequences that may take you two viewings to appreciate in the dim light - what-are-they-seeing-that-I'm-not-seeing kind of stuff. However two viewings and I think I have got the whole plot, or most of it. I might even watch it again sometime, but what I really want is the sequel.ination.

B007VDN1PA|5.0|I am a regular Amazon shopper - this was absolutely the best experience I have had yet. The first scanner I received didn't work correctly. I sent an email to the seller, who responded quickly to my message, called, sent me a new scanner (that works perfectly) and a shipping label to return the first scanner. In the past week I've been able to quickly scan hundreds of slides (some of which are 60 years old) and the quality is very good. I will definitely look to buy from this seller again, and the new scanner works great!\\"
0738212415|5.0|I've ran into this book quite accidentaly, and I'm very glad I did - This book is great introductory book and teaches all the basics you need to draw. The author's approach is exactly what I needed - begining with the very basics, one step at a lesson, no huge jumps, no complicated issues together, he explains the fundumentals in a fun and easy way. And most important - I was really waiting to read the next chapter in each day, after work and kisd's bath and so on - It's worthy just for that :)
B005ILWOZA|5.0|This cd is beautiful. I love every song on it and his voice takes you to a very nice place to just chill out and relax.
0440241901|5.0|5 stars★♥<br /><br />A Brit lit. romance that is a little silly but I like it non the less. It's a typical Kinsella romance that has a little bit of comedy to it.  And it's a joy to reread this.<br /><br />The main character, Emma, tells little secrets to a stranger - Jack.  The little while lies that we tell.  And although I didn't like Jemima that much, I agreed with her about how men don't need to know all our little white lie secrets.<br /><br />The interaction between Emma and Jack (the stranger) is pretty nice. This Jack guy is a pretty good catch (a millionaire and owns a company). You can already predict at the beginning that the two will hook up.  I thought their interactions were all a little bit quick. And even though Jack is a very private person (which I could relate to), he's still very much a likeable guy.<br /><br />Emma does get some backbone but I think it took her too long.  And she only gets this backbone with Jack's help. It would have been nice that she found this strength on her own. This was my only pet peeve with the book. Everything else was very good.<br /><br />I've reread this Kinsella book the most.  Every time I read it, I fall in love with Jack all over again.  I think I like his character out of all of Kinsella's heroes.

0140282033|1.0|I'm halfway through and was wondering whether or not to continue.  The book's back cover reviews by NY Times, USA Today, etc. describe it as enchanting and other fine praisewords but thusfar I'm far from enchanted.  No way can one trust these book reviewers, I'vw found.  Thanks to Amazon reviews here I won't waste any more time on this and will move on to more interesting reading.
B002L5CNRA|5.0|I have loved this story since the first day I saw it.  I had to own a copy of it that way I can watch it when ever is want . Plus Robert De Niro is so fine I love every film he's made put this one in the history books.
0316212377|5.0|Some info, without spoilers: This book is named after a (fictitious, obviously) fiendishly difficult musical composition composed many millennia ago by a composer of the Gzilt civilization \\"for an instrument yet to be invented\\" which would require a genetically modified four-armed humanoid (or android) to play (if it existed) and which (composition) is described as a \\"tour de force of technical bravura with no musical merit to speak of.\\" It's quite good; neither the best nor worst of the author's opus (the book, not the sonata). (Banks mentions that the Sonata could be tolerably played by a string trio, but it's actually designed to be played by an individual on an instrument later created just to play it, called the Antagonistic Undecagon or, elevenstring, for short; the correspondence to the number of dimensions in this particular universe is intentional)).<br /><br />The Gzilt, incidentally, are a Culture-tech-equivalent humanoid species that, 10,000 years ago, was in negotiations to be one of the founding races of the Culture, but backed out and went their own way. Now they're on the verge of subliming (entering 7th through 11th dimensional space, where everything is full, but possibilities and capacities for living to the fullest are endless, (nirvana in other words), en masse, which is, in Banks's universe, pretty much the inevitable fate of all civilizations (that don't destroy themselves first), and even some individual Minds). And stuff is happening, not all of it nice. Culture ships (not Special Circumstances, necessarily, but busybody types nonetheless) are involved. More than that, I shall not reveal.<br /><br />For fans of Banks (and I am one), this book is indispensable. It has the unmistakable voice; the irresistible chattiness of the Ship Minds, the (relatively) fecund imagination. To my mind, it doesn't rise to the level of the best of Banks's science ficiton (Use of Weapons and The Player of Games come to mind), but it is a good read, entertaining,and worth the time and effort to follow. Some of the scenes seem a bit far fetched, stretched, even, but in the end it doesn't matter so much. I preferred the next most recent Culture novel, Surface Detail, but I wouldn't have missed this one, and will unquestionably read the next one, and the one after that, too... Banks is unique, and to my mind one of the very best writers of speculative fiction currently writing.

B009AHWLHE|4.0|It's a fairly straightforward action flick. Won't have too many surprises for people that have played any of the recent Resident Evil games. Just as good as Degeneration and this one has the magnificent Ada Wong in it. The action is good, the story is cheesy, and the monsters are ugly, it's what an RE film should be.

B0034DGPEU|1.0|What a waste of money!  If you have every read Gone With the Wind do not buy this book.  At least GWTW had a more developed story/character line than this. The saving grace in this book is the description of what slavery was like at the time - and even that is not as true as could be.
0439813786|5.0|This is the most amazing book! It was as if I was \\"reading\\" a silent film. The beautiful drawings combined with the short bursts of written narrative come together to create a very touching, heartfelt story of one of the greatest filmmakers that ever lived. This is a book not only about the journey that Hugo takes, but the rediscovery of Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s who is one of the original French cinematographers. Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s is a real person, but Hugo and Isabelle are fictional characters in the book. The way in which Brain Selznick tells his story made me feel as though all the characters in the book were real. I also saw the movie made from this book. While the film itself was good, I was disappointed by how far it strayed from the original direction of the book. This book is perfect the way the author intended it. I give this book \\"5 gnus\\" based on story line, illustration and flow. An enjoyable read for all ages.

B0098VYCCE|2.0|Snow White meets Foto. Not well directed or edited. Concept is fine to twist the Snow White story a tad. Over dramatic thought. The whole movie felt like I was watching a college project to duplicate the Lord Of Rings movie feel as a class project or something. As a class project certainly it deserves an \\"A\\". As a production movie it is more of a \\"C\\".<br /><br />Bummer... it really could have been very good. Anyway... go ahead and watch it.. make sure you watch Lord of Rings first... then comment on my post.

He writes as a poultry farmer: \\"eggs is eggs\\", and not as the Philosophy Professor: \\"ens est ens\\" !!<br />For this reason, this Book is for the \\"Philosophic Mind\\"- within it's pages is contained the whole message of Western Christian Civilisation- Art, Poetry, History, Literature. There is something for everybody in the Book- learned, un-learned, the Philosopher, the Literateur, the Man-of-the-Street the Plain Man, the Educated Man. A wonderful Book- to be read again and again. So easy to purchase on Amazon!!

0316228532|5.0|No. It's not a fantasy book. It never claimed to be a fantasy book, and obviously if you read it, you must be able to read, so take some time to read the sleeve and notice that this was never meant to be a fantasy book. If more people had done this, this quite enjoyable piece of literature would not be rated a mere 3 stars. Honestly, it's ridiculous. Most of the poor reviews are from people who were disappointed it wasn't Harry Potter.. If you rated it poorly due to this reason, you should be ashamed of yourself. If you rated it poorly because you have legit problems with it, then good for you. But I highly doubt most people truly absorbed the story, because not everyone would rate it as highly as I chose to, but it sure as heck wasn't a 1 star read. Come on now... 1 star is like... Dan Brown. Even that Twilight garbage is more like a 2.. hat. Rowling writes better that that, even if you didn't like the story at all.<br /><br />I found this engaging, well written and thought provoking. I enjoyed seeing the inner workings of the townspeople. It was nice to see a book written about how unlikable people are on the inside while maintaining a facade of politeness on the outside. It gave a more real aspect on the intricacies of social society. Overall, a pretty fantastic read.
0316228532|1.0|This book was a major disappointment.  I loved the Harry Potter books.  Thus, my expectations were high for the author's move to adult characters.  I purchased the book at the Philadelphia Airport before flying to a rural destination for four days knowing I would have much time with little or nothing to do.  My first criticism is that she introduces way too many characters in the first few pages and we are supposed to keep these people--parents and their children--separated one from the other.  To complicate this process, she alternates from using their given names and their nicknames.  Unlike War and Peace, there is no list to help the reader remember who the characters are.  I had nothing else to read otherwise I probably would have given up after 50+ pages.  All of the characters keep returning over and over so one does not feel that some are important and some not.  My second criticism is that all of the characters are dysfunctional.  There is no one to like or cheer onward.  One does not care about anyone in this tale.  I do not recommend the book.

This does not make me want to purchase the game, it makes me want to delete what little bit I have takeing up good space.

1401937268|5.0|I am normally not a huge fan of Doreen Virtue's work as her views tend to be too much towards what I call \\"fluff bunny\\" new age beliefs.  However, this angel tarot is beautifully done.<br /><br />~The Art~<br />The pictures are very well designed so that the faces and postures of the people in them can reflect different emotions and ideas based on what your mind is seeking in the question you asked.  The overall style is beautiful and uplifting.  There is also enough color to keep you eye moving and interest your mind.  I see new details every time I use these cards.<br /><br />~Card Meanings On The Cards~<br />I have been reading tarot for more than a decade and I know the cards really well.  But it is still great to have the little definitions at the top and bottom of each card that let me know this deck's unique take on each card meaning.  The top gives over view words and the bottom lists phrases that explain common meanings of that card. I have also found that in my readings sometime a specific word or phrase from the card itself will jump out at me and ad depth to what I am asking about.<br /><br />~Feel of The Deck~<br />This deck is a little large for me-- I have very small hands-- but it flexes and shuffles very well.  It also feels well made and not at all cheap or flimsy.<br /><br />~Guide Book~<br />I am honestly not thrilled with the guide book.  It does give good information but it the type is very small and close together.  It is gray on white, which makes it harder to read as well.  As I mentioned, it does contain good info. But if you have vision issues it will be hard to read.  (I have 20/20 vision and I have a hard time reading it.)<br /><br />~Packaging/Box~<br />Very sturdy and beautiful.  No complaints.

B008G8SFGO|3.0|I had high expectations for this album, most of which were based on the band's own comments.  When I first heard \\"Hell of Hallelujah\\" on my local radio station I was worried.  I thought the song sounded like filler between good songs.  So when I got the album I listened to it at work, at home, and in the car hoping for the best.  Here's my opinion:  most later KISS albums have a couple of really good catchy songs surrounded by a few bad ones, and the rest are OK.  On this album they've leveled that off, which to me isn't always a good thing.  Besides \\"Freak\\" I like most of the songs, but could care less if I ever hear them live.  I think that is one of the most important aspects of any new KISS album.  Now there are some I'd rather hear live over others, but when they open the concert with \\"Hell or Hallelujah\\" instead of say \\"Detroit Rock City/King of the Night Time World\\" I'll just shake my head.  I also wanted to agree that having Tommy and Eric in the band makes everything so much better than before.  You cannot release an album of OK songs and state that this version of the band is taking them forward, especially when one of the songs rips off \\"Mr. Speed\\" from Rock and Roll Over and both Tommy and Eric's singing is meant to mimic Ace and Peter.  I know this sounds harsh, especially from someone who's listened to them since the mid-seventies, but this album is good, not great and they are running out of chances.  I know I'll go see the tour, I'm sure I'll buy the next album because I have all the others, but I see them on a decline.
B002VHI8J0|1.0|One of the very, very few books I have quit after 50 pages - unbearable and unreadable.  It was our book club choice for later this month and it has been rejected (so far) by 5 of the 8 of us - this is the first time in our 10 year history, that we have given up on a book without completing it.<br />It does get some excellent reviews on-line, but I concur with the Sunday Telegraph who refused to review it, saying it was unreadable.<br />Exactly!
B00881VLCE|4.0|Puzzles are fun and very colorful. Have difficulty sometimes getting the pieces to move or rotate, but most of the time it works.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The Kitchen House is a captivating book.  The characters are emotionally and intellectually compelling, as are their relationships, conflicts, and actions.  The setting and colloquial speech are true to life.  Books about slavery are hard to read sometimes, but the book is historically important and, evenmore, I was hooked from the beginning of chapter 1 and I looked forward to picking the book up each night.  It's a book that stays with you when you're done reading.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|I love the Bad 25! The cds were amazing ! I love the new songs ! Wasn't too crazy about the remixes. I really, really enjoyed the Bad Tour concert! I was in awe and beyond words! I watch it over and over again! For any MJ fan, it's a must have!
B0083GQKQG|4.0|A frightenly scary look into what is a very believeable real-life scenario; it doesn't try to answer the nature or nuture question but it definitely fogs the lines...well acted with odd pacing and a few 'unlikely in real life' scenes but overall...great film, it will stick in your head a few days to be sure.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|This is literally the best Nerf blaster ever comes with 4 six dart clips and can hold up to 8 clips.With 8  18 dart clips you can have 144 darts at a time and if you have a tactical vest or the bandolier kit you could have a few quick clips to reload to I would reccomend this blaster to any one it would be an awesome Christmas/B-Day present.Most reccomended!
B003FHMHPQ|5.0|This little book contains a wealth of information about earth angels and who they are: we are all earth angels in our different ways, and this helps us to learn to recognise the various types and their roles in bringing our spiritual lives into line with our earthly lives. I find myself becoming more aware of the people in my life and looking at them with new understanding, and that's what this book has done for me.

0156034026|4.0|As a Middle Eastern immigrant and author of the [[ASIN:B006LN8JJE The Last Moderate Muslim]], 9/11 wreaked havoc on my world, differently. In my case, I got devastated primarily by the loss of innocent lives, and secondarily by kissing my new way of life good bye. \\"They are here\\" is the thought that crossed my mind. Another one, \\"Where should I go to start and sustain a good life away from these thugs...where should I go?\\" to say the least.<br /><br />Mohsin's story grants readers a unique point of view into the rooted cultural factors that weigh immigrants down. Yes! Down!<br /><br />America and the for the most part the western world open their arms to the intelligent, hard working, and seemingly adaptive individuals. In return, the rewards in personal and professional growth are astronomical. That is the protagonist experience in The Reluctant Fundamentalist, until of course, he begins to internalize cues that can be overcome with staying the course, and opening the mind and heart a bit more.<br /><br />Changez decided to return to a place from which education was unmatched to that in the USA and most certainly job opportunities. You can't get such a position in the third world without knowing highly influential - corrupt individuals. The choices he made were poor, and most certainly for readers were clear.<br /><br />I do know why Changez returned to Pakistan. He made a decision, where he aligned his soul, and heart, where his body was not. He never left Pakistan.<br /><br />The character's return to Pakistan makes an important statement: Many among us are unable to unsubscribe from our upbringing, culture, and education and question the lack of wisdom of the religious and political leaders. Most return to the homeland driven by an inner and inexplicable calling. That label, \\"homeland\\" should be eliminated from the lexicon of an immigrant intent on starting a new life. It is a frame of mind and heart. Moreover, it is more alarming, if some are still here and not really here. That applies to those of all faiths eagerly working on the heavenly life sacrificing earthly and humane harmonic relations.<br /><br />I think the story is phenomenal in making that connection clearer.really here. That applies to those of all faiths eagerly working on the heavenly life sacrificing earthly and humane harmonic relations.<br /><br />I think the story is phenomenal in making that connection clearer.
B004GJYRKA|4.0|Great movie from Bruce Lee. This is one of the best movies which Bruce Lee made during his career. It's one of my Bruce Lee movies. Part history and part entertaining. It's fun to watch again and again.
0761169431|3.0|The book is ok; it contains lots of pages of fun facts, but frankly, I thought it would come with the paper to make the projects and it doesn't. The price isn't bad, but I would've been happy to pay a bit more if it included the paper, too.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Was worth the rental, but beyond that, not so much.  It's mildly entertaining, a few good scenes (Rue's death was handled quite well and emotionally), but overall, just ok.  Book adaptations usually fall short due to time constraints and such is the case here.  Check out the Honest Trailer online.  Pulls in everything from the book that was missing in the movie.
0316228532|5.0|I think plot details have been reviewed pretty well by this time, so I'd like to comment on the characters.<br /><br />What I have always loved about Rowling's writing is her ability to create characters that seem real.  She knows her characters,she knows what to do with them, and she isn't afraid to let bad things happen to them. In this novel, she has dozens of characters to work with, and oftentimes background information has to be supplied and the actual plot suspended so that the reader can keep up with everyone.  I personally don't mind because I find these characters absolutely fascinating, but the lack of action isn't going to appeal to everyone.<br /><br />With many books it is very clear who the reader should be \\"rooting\\" for, since one character seems to stand above the rest morally or in talent.  If you are expecting the same formula in this book you will be disappointed, because each character is deeply flawed, each with his or her own ugliness.  My point is that there is no hero, unless you count the deceased Barry Fairbrother, and I even wonder about him.  Again, I find this refreshing.  It makes me irrationally annoyed to see so many bestsellers about a klutzy, yet otherwise completely endearing protagonist attracting all men within a ten mile radius.  You will not find that here.  Thank God.<br /><br />The counterpoint to this is that each character is also endearing or relatable in his or her own way.  With each shifting viewpoint (and there are many), new insights are revealed that make it easier to understand each character.  It is a style that makes it hard to put the book down, since she never gives you all you want to know at once.<br /><br />Other points: I'm a fast reader, and ordinarily I'd have knocked this out in a night, but I decided to stretch it out over a couple of days.  I really think this helps for understanding the characters and their connections better -- if you don't get those, you won't understand the plot.<br /><br />Also, many people are commenting on the use of strong language, sexuality, and rape.  Personally, I think if you are going to write about problems in a small town and the people in it, these things almost beg to be addressed.  That Rowling did not avoid them speaks to her strength as a character writer; it doesn't mean, for example, that she's using four letter words just because she can't think of a better one.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Yes, there are a lot of gaps in logic. Yes, it is a huge stretch of the imagination. Yes, it would have been better if some of the movie wasn't edited out. I truly wish they would have put out an extended version of this movie where the waylan industries speech started the movie. This would have made a lot of questions non existant. That being said.<br /><br />This is a fun movie that provokes the mind to see outside the box and just enjoy a good old sci-fi. If you like any of the alien movies you will like this and enjoy the ending scenes. It is an updated homage to the old films and a good watch.
B004SRWW0C|4.0|A very good file manager for copying, moving, creating directories and files. Be sure you know what you are doing with this app since it has access to system files and can cause damage to your device if you are not very careful. Recommended for those that have a need.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|This is an awesome book by one of the great mystery writers of the day...  Kathy Reichs had done it again.
B008CPRLP2|4.0|A good file unzipper with a couple of drawbacks that are not show stoppers: cannot do .rar files and cannot zip up files or folders. Otherwise, recommended for general unzipping.

B008EZVNO0|3.0|(Not trying to start a flame war, here. I basically like Van Morrison. Just thought I'd post my thoughts on this release.)<br /><br />I've always kinda felt that, with his later albums, listening to a few songs in a row by Morrison was way better than listening to an entire set. This CD confirms it. The first 6 cuts are pretty good...nothing that will add to his impressive list of classics. But the last three cuts are, in my opinion, pretty poor. Primarily in the lyrics department. Sounds as if Morrison didn't want to put just a bit more effort in polishing them?<br /><br />Cut 7, \\"If In Money We Trust\\" is a cool groove (especially during the extended fadeout), but the melody, such as it is, and the lyrics are pretty poor by Van Morrison standards. \\"Haunting,\\" I guess, is the feel he was going for.<br /><br />Although I like the Delta Blues groove of Pagan (cut 9), the repetitive \\"...my pagan heart, my pagan soul...\\" wears thin after a while. I would think that he could some up with another couple of lines to fill the space, rather than repeat the phrase for what seems like a hundred times. The long, bluesy end of the cut would be very, very cool except for it.<br /><br />A particularly annoying move is to place \\"Educating Archie\\" right after \\"Pagan Heart.\\" It has the EXACT SAME BEAT, and similar baseline, though it is not a Delta Blues style. And the lyrics are not very eloquent; sounds like a blog set to music. Or possibly one of those songs from the 60's where a company would advertise in a fan magazine \\"send us your song poem and we'll put it to music.\\"

B008QTVNUI|5.0|My wife and I bought Homeland Season 1 after seeing all the awards the series won at the 2012 Emmys. We were not disappointed. The first day we streamed three episodes, back to back to back. It was so good we had to ration the remaining episodes so we could get other stuff done. It is THAT good. The acting is great, the story lines keep you on edge the whole time: is CIA operative Carrie (Claire Danes) imagining all this? or is returned POW Marine SGT Brody (Damian Lewis) really a terrorist? If I were a TV/movie critic, I could write a novella about all the aspects of script, character and plot development, about the intricacies of shot selection, filming, and editing. But I won't bore you will all of those. Suffice it to say the script, acting, filming, editing, etc. are all excellent. Enough so that I cannot wait for Season 2 so I can stream it, also.  Plus, I think Mandy Patinkin also deserved an Emmy. Just know that there is nudity in a few places.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I think the whole trilogy was awesome but I would hav to say that fifty shades darker was the best out of all three
B008RYN44U|1.0|I'm not one of those people who thinks that bands have to sound the exact same with every single release but this is just a stinking pile of feces, just terrible. I have no idea why they chose to release this as a 'No Doubt' album? Why not just a Stefani solo album that sounds like Katy Perry or Gaga or whatever other pop nonsense is popular right now. If that's your thing then that's great but this is about as far from No Doubt as you can conceive. I am SOOO glad I listened to this at a friend's house first before buying because I woulda been pissed
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Being a person who is detrimentally opposed to purchasing any and all digital content it killed me to not play these games so I overjoyed at finally being able to buy a physical copy of these games and I did so without hesitation. I can only comment on the 3 main games as of now since I haven't checked out the bonus content or the mini games yet and waiting till I have finished and satisfied with the 3 main releases in this collection.<br /><br />Flower: An absolute joy to play. It has been decades since I played a game and found myself smiling and actually feeling happy playing it. It's such a simple game with no spoken dialogue, no words, no context given or anything. You use one button essentially, have the visuals and music throughout the game and nothing more. I found something akin back to a Disney movie of sorts about good and evil that is told so subtly that its mind boggling as to how they told a story that is barely there using so little and having such an effect on me. I played the game twice and had just as much fun the second time. Its a very soothing game, very peaceful and yet instills a sense of dread at certain points.<br /><br />Journey: Like so many others, it made me cry at the end. I can't explain why or how but I just felt a surge of happiness that it made me tear up right at the last section of the game. Again it told this story using very little at all beyond just images and interpretation. Although this game seemed to have more story to it. Sadly I can't go into details without spoiling anything, but once you play it you will see what I mean. Wonder, happiness, sadness, danger, loneliness and excitement were feelings I had when playing this game. I played it twice but I'm holding off as I don't want to overdue, this will be a game I come back to again soon but I don't want to wear out its welcome.<br /><br />Flow: Not a terrible game but just not something I enjoyed. It was fun, interesting and different. But it just felt unfinished and thecontrols left something to be desired. I didn't hate it by any means but it just didn't resound with me the way the other 2 games did. This was also their first game so growing pains are to be expected and you can definitely see they made a huge leap in their skills when making flower and further polishing themselves with journey.<br /><br />All in all I can't recommend this collection enough. For 30 bucks purchasing it new shouldn't be a problem because I got more out of these for 30 bucks than I have spending 500 bucks on big name games from the past 2 or 3 years. I reminded me of why I love games like I did when I was a kid instead of just spending 60 bucks on brand x AAA title of the month and going through the motions only to finish it and forgetting most of what I just played. Not to mention your measly 30 bucks will support this amazing developer and keep them making more great titles.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|One of my fondest memories as a child was 1979 Alien in theater.  I'll never forget the sound clunk clunk clunk of my Father brother and I smacking the back of our heads in total terror against the wall behind us in the last row of the theater as the alien erupted from the belly.  I have always been a huge fan of sci-fi, horror, etc.  Prometheus was really painful to watch.  Almost void of terror, and really constantly unbelievable and at times just stupid and silly.  Alien on the other hand was constantly feeding pure terror, and always realistic to the point of believable.  Prometheus is unworthy of it's association with Alien.  Quite frankly I am really disappointed with the terrible garbage hollywood churns out.  Good movies are just so ridiculously rare these days.  Yeah go ahead and rent this movie.  What else are ya gonna do with $4, eat a McDonald's Cheeseburger.  My how the end of times seems so near.
B002OR0RP0|5.0|This movie like the previous ice age movies was an outstanding movie for all ages. Its humor is funny for kids as well as adults.
B0052RDHTM|2.0|I have always enjoyed Follett's writing.  However, I felt this story could have been told with more brevity and better maintain one's interest.  There were good parts in the book.  But, there was also page after page of meaningless dialogue, facts, and incidents.  This does not measure up to Mr. Follett's previous work.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|This movie was downright awful. My wife and I went to see this in the theatre and it was a disaster. I cant really figure out how people think this was a good movie. If your definition of \\"good\\" is some way of keeping you out of the heat of summer for two hours a success, then eureka... winner. The whole thing was a bloody mess. Melodramatic at its best, simply insipid the rest. I have seen Kristin Stewart in decent roles in her early career, but she is basically playing her bella character guised in the mythos of snow white. yeah she looks good, but that is about it. It all felt weak. I felt there could have been a better movie there, but it just stayed flat without much real inspection of the huntsman part, the only way to make this work and not turn it into a live action anti-disney film. If you want to watch charlize expose her back and see the cool television trailer in \\"context\\" spend your money, otherwise watch the trailer and move on.
0345803493|5.0|Anyone who loves to read, and loves adventure and romance will LOVE this book.  It is an excellent follow-up to the first book and continues on with the excitement of a new love.  The book is intended for a more mature audience, but any grown woman will appreciate the excitement!

B008TMA1LY|3.0|I downloaded the app since my daughter likes to watch me play Emily's delicious wedding series of games. Hello Kitty Cafe is very similar to those time management games. You seat customers, make the food, serve them and checkout all in the hopes of doing it fast and getting more coins for upgrades. The graphics are cute and the music is slightly annoying. The game play is harder than it looks, the screen makes it hard to touch the right person and my daughter gave up 10 second into the first scene.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Better than expected. Thought it would be another stereotypical action film but it was actually entertaining. Also has a great movie quote :)

B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is one of the best games ever, in my opinion, especially the computer version, and now also the Xbox. Minecraft PE may seem like it is too pricey for what it is now, but believe me, it is!

B002GYI9C4|4.0|I purchased the package of all the books in the series, so this review is a collective process. All of them would have managed 4-5 stars...about 4.5 if I was allowed.<br /><br />First off, the books are written to pull you in to the world. I was instantly intrigued by the world he painted...it was fascinating trying to imagine the world the books were set in.<br /><br />One of my biggest pet peeves with this book was the fact that I never seemed to be able to relate to the main character, Vin. The first and second books, I wanted more than anything to find a connection to her and really be concerned that she would continue to grow and succeed in the remaining books. I finally felt like I knew more about her after the last of the second book...I just wish I could have learned more about HER in the first book. There was no down time to really see her in both a good and bad setting. It just kind of jumped in to quickly and I felt like I wanted to know her better. I would even go as far to say I felt like I knew Kelsier better than Vin by the second book. Maybe it was meant to be this way...but I just couldn't bring myself to like Vin enough to hope she hung on and be interested enough in what happened to her.<br /><br />If by the end of the 3rd book, you haven't caught on to what the Lord Ruler is (or at least partially) with the metals he keeps on him after Sazed time and again told what they were used for...maybe you are slightly dense or just not into the books. I linked the two rather quickly...and especially after the journal. I wasn't all-knowing though...the part of him being able to use both types of 'power' was a surprise.<br /><br />Speaking of which, I wish the author had expanded a little more on it. I felt it was a major part of the story and I wanted it explained/expanded/used more.<br /><br />The writing was good and I kept reading but I didn't feel bad for putting it down either. I am hoping another book comes out to tell what happened after the final empire fell.mpire fell.
B0082FPIY8|5.0|exellent book, you can tell it's a real life experience.It takes you on a trip that very few people have the courage to undertake and even fewer alone.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|I am a long time fan of Lee Child and have read all the Jack Reacher books, often waiting impatiently for the next release, as was the case with \\"A Wanted Man\\". Sadly, Mr Child seems to have run out of ideas when it comes to Jack Reacher and I found the book to be tedious and repetitive. This may well be the last time I spend money on any more books in the series. I sincerely hope that if Lee Child pens another book he digs deeper and brings us something akin to his earlier stories. If not, then I'm afraid I'm done.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The entire trilogy is a suspenseful romance novel full of little surprises along the way. The author's word choice still leaves much to the imagination, which was quite refreshing.

B003W16T9K|5.0|how i love the cracker barrel and the opinions that are swapped around it ... the fatuous pastime of *ranking* recording sets, or separate symphony performances within sets (why not separate movement performances within separate symphonies within recording sets?). this may seem compelling to some people, but it betrays an outlook overwhelmed by the marketing mentality (\\"buy today ... and own THE BEST\\").<br /><br />relax in your seat, and turn down the lights and you'll discover this is a splendid set, front to back, from the recording quality to the chamber orchestral transparency to the modern musical texts to the intelligent, insightful and supple conducting by abbado. the horn introduction to the 9th is superbly phrased, and the energy and dynamics of the whole performance perfectly judged. the 8th is restless and searching, shafts of light in the darkness, and the 5th sprightly and fresh. the remaining symphonies are given a poised and finished account in the biedermeier quality of schubert's time, and one can appreciate these symphonies for what they are: inventive and appealing minor works. throughout one feels the enthusiasm of the young musicians and the directing inspiration abbado drew from them. at reduced price, a great value.
B003THHIEM|5.0|The show always surprises me. It's full of humor, drama, and I'm always left wanting more. Not your cookie cutter police/crime drama. Stories are ever changing & I never feel like I've seen it before or even anything similar. Beckett & Castle have great chemistry. No one could play Richard Castle better then Nathan Fillion. He is a perfect fit. I'm hoping this show will be around for along time. Lifelong fan...
B008220CFG|5.0|Viewers, readers! Help me find the official Jewish exorcism text(s)! Got a lead on the official Jewish binding and exorcism rituals, enter the(ir) title(s) as a comment to this request.<br /><br />Here's the official Roman Catholic Exorcism text:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0012U5R9G The Roman Ritual [Rituale Romanum]: Vol 2: Christian Burial, Exorcism, Reserved Blessings, etc [Latin/English]]]<br /><br />This movie sure is scary alright! I'm buying multiple copies of it for my collection.<br /><br />I won't say too much about the synopsis of this movie as you can read it elsewhere. In summary, this movie it's about a box containing an evil spirit that was bound by Jewish binding rituals. An unsuspecting girl, Emily, opens the box and gets possessed. Strange disturbances occur in the house. The daddy grows desperate in searching for answers that leads him to a Hasidic Jewish community. Although the storyline is simple enough, the drama such is tense and scary! Watch this movie in a theater and you could be jumping out of your seat!<br /><br />I'm collecting this movie because it is based on a true story, stories rather. Such things are quite common, even though they're never acknowledged by the general public.<br /><br />This movie will teach everyone a lesson: do NOT ever buy ancient, antique, curious items from unknown sellers, especially those that come with unknown inscriptions that cannot be traced to a safe and reliable source.<br /><br />The story in this movie is not something new to me, I've personally heard such stories from elsewhere. This is a reason why I went to watch this scary movie.<br /><br />Sorry to say this, but this is also not the first time I hear of most Jews refusing to exorcise a possessed person out of fear, as seen in the movie. So, what would I advise the daddy in this movie to do? If the Jews are reluctant to deal with their own rituals, go find a real Catholic priest (not those Liberal unbelievers)! For serious cases like the one you see in this movie, it is not advisable to do the ritual on your own like what the daddy tried to do in this movie.<br /><br />If victims like this Emily character is looking for a lasting solution to her afflictions, the only solution is to turn to the Catholic Church for answers. However, applying for an official exorcism in the Catholic Church could take months for formal approval as the applicant is being checked out and examines by secular medical community and then by the ecclesiastical authorities. There are many reasons for this seemingly bureaucratic process. The Church has had enough of its skeptical and time-wasting scoffers. In the majority of cases, most common applicants need not have a formal exorcism in the first place. Most afflicted applicants give up before they even begin. Compound the bureaucratic process with the fact that the current establishment is Liberal, you'd just have to find a listening ear by looking for a validly ordained Conservative or Traditional priest.

B00377E5SG|5.0|This is a wonderful remake of an earlier movie.  Who would have thought Harrison Ford could do comedy. All the scenery is so pretty.  The young girl did a very good job in her role.
B008RTE066|5.0|When I first watched this movie as a kid I thought it was very tedious except for the brilliant musical segments. Watching it now as an old man I'm surprised how short the film is (only 53 minutes). It goes by really quickly in spite of some of the (for some people) boring comedy scenes. 75% of the new remastered film is high resolution audio of the best music The Beatles ever recorded IMO, and that makes this Blu-ray release of MMT absolutely essential. We have the vinyl set coming soon, but this BD has really got me salivating for the catalog on Blu-ray (or SACD or DVD-Audio).
B0086700CM|3.0|My daughter loves this game, but I'm not really sure if it is age appropriate for her, which is why I only gave the game \\"3 stars.\\"  Otherwise product is fine.
B008OJ291W|5.0|When I first heard that Jeff Lynne was going to re-record all the ELO hits I was sceptical. Whenever I hear a re-recording it never sounds better because it's usually changed and more watered down with all the nuance and charm sucked out of it, but I heard a snippet on TV and was captivated...it sounded incredible! I immediately ordered the CD and it arrived a day later. Bear in mind I've been an ELO fan since 1976 when they played the soundtrack to my youth. I was more than surprised, I was astounded. Every song is true to the original...the same nuance, the same balance, the same instrumentation, the same vocals. Nothing has been altered. It just sounds...better. It's almost imperceptible to naked ear that it's a re-record so close are they to the original. I can't imagine how incredibly hard it must have been to do this so many years later with completely different technology. Jeff Lynne has paid respects to these incredible songs by not changing them in any way except to make every instrument sound clearer and more edgy. How on earth did he manage to recreate some of those sounds and maintain the same balance and feel? I speak from experience being a recording artist myself. I've done my fair share of recording to know what an amazing feat this is. This is what proves he is indeed a genius. We knew it already but this is the proof. Fantastic work Mr Lynne.
B008G8SFGO|3.0|Well Here it is some very good songs much better than Sonic Boom BUT it fails where Sonic Boom had so so songs and GREAT sound this one has very good songs with not so good sound. Whoever mastered it or whatever has ruined it..compressed? Paul are you going deaf in the other ear too? Why did you let this one get by like this?
B009CGYO0K|3.0|I purchased this book on iBooks, as it was not available on any of my Kindle devices.<br /><br />Overall, the book is all right with some funny comics and a lot of characters from the Oatmeal webcomic. However, most of it is just okay and I wouldn't say this is his funniest work. You might enjoy it more if you really love his cat comics. At most, a few laughs. It is not bad for the price.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|Friends, there are MANY reviews out there that cover the 'technical' aspects of this product (you'll see words like 'piledriver', '32nm', 'trinity', and 'HSA' thrown around, but who cares?) and LOTS of misinformation from people who won't put their mouth where their money is - you gotta try it before u knock on it first right? Yours truly bought it when available on day 1 (from Newegg, Amazon was 'out of stock') after following the news about it for a year.  There's no such thing as a bad product, just bad prices right?<br /><br />As a smart, savvy shopper (which you all are), you know you've got to compare apples to apples, especially when it comes to electronics.  So what do we need to compare this to? The intel core i3-3225, ivy-bridge processor, which retails for about $130 at MicroCenter (the LOWEST price you will find this chip anywhere).  Why not the bazillion other 'i3' processors floating around out there you ask? Because only the i3-3225 has the HD4000 integrated graphics baked in, which will give you the most graphic horsepower of the 'i3' lot.  That being said, the A10-5800K is its direct competitor; it likewise has the strongest integrated graphics of the AMD side of these new 'fusion' chips.  So why does this matter? Because if you want to play computer games on a budget, these are the chips you're going to want to look at.  When I say budget, how much of a budget are we talking? I'm talking a $600 budget on EVERYTHING that goes into building a new computer, short of the monitor itself.  I even got some premium hardware like a 128 SSD, a good Seasonic power supply, strong 1866 RAM, and barely broke $600.  For the truly awesome bargain hunters, I have no doubt you could do this under $500.<br /><br />If you want to play the latest and greatest games on 'HIGH' settings which will give you lots of eye-candy with all the highest details turned on at 1920x1200 (big 24-in. display) resolution, STOP reading this review.  In this price-range, we're not 'into' paying hundreds of dollars for better looking graphics on the screen (and gobs of money to buy equipment to cool down the high temps too!), but if you are, you already KNOW you're not seriously thinking of buying either an i3 or the A10.  Google 'confirmation bias' if you're still in denial about that.<br /><br />If you want to play the latest and greatest games on 'LOW' to 'MEDIUM' settings which will give you some eye-candy with some details turned on at 1366x768 ('default' low resolution), KEEP READING.  After combing through more forums than i can count reading hundreds of arguments where techie people who love intel or AMD feverishly shout and insult at each other over 'i3 versus A10' (these things stir strong passions!), here is the main takeaway about gaming with either the i3 or A10, which is the main selling point of both:<br /><br />1. If you buy the i3, you MUST buy a separate graphics card to play most games comfortably (at least 30 frames per second).  Look for graphics cards in the $70-$100 price range as these would fit the bill, as there are too many to list.  Some notable nominees include the Nvidia 550, or Radeon 7750.<br /><br />2. If you buy the A10, you do NOT need to buy a separate graphics card to play most games comfortably (again, 30 frames per second).  You COULD buy another graphics card and add it on to enable 'dual graphics', but you would have to buy a Radeon 6670 to do that, and even then, not all games are going to benefit from it.  That being said, you're still in 'budget' gaming territory, so this is an extra cost which in my opinion doesn't really deliver.<br /><br />About CPU performance - Intel is better, and that's a fact.  But in this day and age, the modern computer chip will be able to do what I spend about 99% of my time on the computer doing anyway: bothering people on facebook, e-mail, typing papers, watching youtube, burning a CD/DVD, and occasional gaming.  If you are into the more exotic stuff (trans-coding files, running very powerful benchmarks/overclocking, high-end gaming) again, this is NOT the chip for you.  Lots of mis-information out there, and there are people who will throw bar charts and graphs at each other to prove an obvious point, which is intel has more powerful CPUs, but ask yourself, 'what am I going to do on my computer?'.  For me personally, I have no complaints with the A10's performance, based on how I use mine.  If you are truly frustrated by your computer's performance, then buy a SSD (solid state drive) and replace your hard drive, you'll feel a HUGE difference.  But hey, that's not really part of our discussion, just my opinion, so feel free to disagree.<br /><br />So let's say your sold on it, and you're thinking how to get the most out of this chip, here are the KEY things to know about this chip:<br /><br />1. Look for a 'FM2' motherboard, this is the main compatibility spec.  There are three flavors of FM2 boards (from least to most expensive): A55, A75, and A85X.  They all have different selling points, but once you dig into prices you'll know exactly which one you're going to want to get.  AMD has committed to sticking with FM2 boards all the way until 2014, so don't worry about having to buy another motherboard if you want to upgrade down the road.<br /><br />2. This chip EATS memory like no other: buy 2 sticks of 240-pin, 1866-mhz DRAM for optimal performance and stability.  Anything less than 1866-mhz and you're short-changing yourself on performance.  Anything more than 1866 and you're going to be dealing with overclocking and system stability issues, which gives diminishing returns all the way up to 2600-mhz.<br /><br />3. This box comes with a 'stock' cooling fan for the chip.  Yes it's crappy (most stock coolers are), but it gets the job done.  Again, if you get into overclocking, this is NOT going to cut it...and, you're on your own!<br /><br />4. You CAN overclock with this processor, but you will need to do a LOT of tweaking, and it will be expensive to do so and get marginal gains, so maybe you won't want to.  But if you want to take this to its thermal limit, liquid cooling is a MUST.  You'll also have to disable the 'turbo' cores, and tinker with AMD's overdrive utility to increase the voltage and multipliers.  Chances are if you're in the budget gaming world, liquid cooling is probably not in your budget anyway.  But the headroom is there.<br /><br />At the end of the day, ask yourself 2 questions:<br /><br />1. What am i going to use the computer for?<br />2. How much do i want to spend?<br /><br />I wanted to do basic stuff on my computer, play some games I liked on low to medium settings comfortably, and stay under $600 with a  well-rounded system.  I didn't buy another graphics card to accomplish that, because with this chip, I didn't need to.  And I didn't buy any extra cooling equipment, because of diminishing returns from overclocking, which I don't do.  Do I have a bias towards AMD? Yes, with this chip, but that's because it fit my budget, it plays games reasonably well, and it does what i want it to well.  AND if you REALLY want to save even more...wait until Christmas!  AMD is very well known for dropping their prices on a dime, and bundling with extra components, which could drop your total price by about $40 or more.<br /><br />That being said, you will NOT find a more well-rounded system on a chip that will go into a desktop than this one on a budget.<br /><br />Happy bargain hunting folks!<br /><br />EDIT 10/11/2012--------<br /><br />For those of you are stuck in the trenches of budget gaming, but somehow find yourself with several hundred dollars more (or maybe you're just 'feeling' richer), here's a great article which pairs up the A10 and intel i5 with some high end current generation graphics cards and plays through some games on very high settings, to give some meaty comparisons.  I won't spoil the takeaway, but trust me, you WILL want to look at this if you decide to splurgeon another video card.  I can't paste the link here, but google 'VRZone A10-5800k discrete' and it will be the first hit...<br /><br />EDIT 2 10/18/2012-------<br /><br />Just played through F1 2012, Counterstrike GO, and Battlefield 3 this past week.

B0090EHVMC|5.0|The movie was very entertaining and kept our son busy for quite a while. We read the book often and liked the adaptation to film. Good video quality on Amazon instant video app through our Panasonic Viera tv.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Some of the background is photo real, which is a great advance for Pixar which started behind Pinocchio in that regard. The characters are better rounded than most Disney characters. And, the action had me at the edge of my seat. The only draw back is that this movie may scare very small children.
B00943SQCI|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. My daughters and I love to watch Halloween type movies that are on the sillier side. What I liked about this is that even though there were some sexual overtones, it was not in your face or overdone. I didn't feel uncomfortable watching with my girls (aged 13-9). Johnny Depp was perfect for his role as Barnabus and it was really a fun role to see Michelle Pfiffer(?) play. All in all we'll watch this one again!
0316228532|4.0|J.K. Rowling has once again engulfed her readers in another world.  This time its not full of witches, wizards and magical creatures, but the real life demons addiction, prejudice, abuse and poverty....to name a few.  The characters are richly developed and well crafted, allowing the reader insight into why and how they've become the people they are.  While all manner of unpleasant dramas unfold in the seemingly ideal town of Pagford, the heart of the book is the battle between the classes and the potential repercussions to society of turning a blind eye towards the poor and disadvantaged.<br /><br />Rowlings views on poverty, social injustice, and denial by the upper class and political parties to accept and address the issues that continue to plague the poor are dramatically and explicitly expressed.  No ugly stone is left unturned.  While I am glad that I read this book, and actually feel enlightened about some of the socio-economic issues our society faces, I was also glad when it was finished.  It's realistic, slightly dark and raw, but definitely makes you examine your views on the disadvantaged and lingers in your mind long after the last page is read.  J.K. Rowling is a gifted storyteller and \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is no exception.
B008RV5K4U|4.0|I have really been liking the new DC animated movies that have been coming out over the past couple years, I think they do an exceptionally good job on the Batman movies. When this one came out I had to pick it up.<br /><br />For those not aware, or that savvy, when it comes to the Batman Comics(myself included) this movie is based upon the pivotal and epic graphic novel/run of Batman comics, with the same title, written by the renowned Frank Miller (Sin City, 300, ...etc) . I personally have not read the entire collection, but it is pretty well known that this story, released in the mid to late 1980's, was one of the pivotal works, that brought Batman back into the public eye, and really helped to re-define the character. After this story was released, the \\"Adam West Batman\\" of the 1960s was finally set to rest, and the gritty/dark Batman mythos took the forefront in public's mind. This story set the stage for the Tim Burton films, and their dark setting. In addition, this story was released at the time where comic books were making their shift from child to more mature audiences: this story solidified that.<br /><br />This story is about the return of Batman, after retirement, to once again clean the streets of Gotham City. Unlike most Batman stories this movie does not really include many members of the \\"Rogues Gallery\\" but focuses on his clash with some new villains. I do not want to give away too much of the story for those who have not read or watched the story, but it is pretty cool to see a Batman story set in setting not so familiar to most Batman fans. Due to the size of the story, DC has decided to release this story in two separate movies. While this might piss some people off, I think it was a pretty good move, and kept them from skimping over the details and content, in order to meet the format. The story is very engaging, and lets the viewer see characters in a very different yet familiar way<br /><br />Like most current DC animated movies, the animation has a anime' influenced style. I would not say that I really enjoyed the animation, but you can see that the some of the original \\"Frank Miller\\" look was kept. I personally would have preferred the movie be almost a complete Frank Miller graphic novel brought to life, but I am not sure if that would have marketed well. In short, I think DC settled for a nice middle ground, when bringing this story to life.<br /><br />The only complaint I really have with this DVD is the special features. We do get a sneak peak into part 2 of this series, which is cool, but besides some trailers, not much is offered, maybe because this is a one disc version of the movie, and maybe they will release a two disc version with more stuff. I would have really like to see a documentary on the original graphic novel, highlighting it's influence on the world of comics, included with this DVD.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|The package for my three DVDs came really quickly, like 4 business days and they were all in great shape.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|as with all of Martins reads the characters are complex and sound. Just like true to life people the good have the ability for evil and vice versa. Keeps you guessing as to what will happen next, but I promise....you wont
B008RYN44U|1.0|From my hometown of Anaheim, No Doubt are easily one of my favorite bands of all time, but this latest record they put out definitely was a major bummer to me. First of all, Mostly all of the tracks on the album do not have a band sound but an electric sound and that right away dropped this down to three stars. This album told me they wanted to give away their rock roots and dive into the pop sound, which I wouldn't have a problem with if all the songs didn't sound so unmemorable. Most of these songs didn't catch on to me, and I played this whole cd on a couple of long drives. Not even the acoustic versions of the songs did this album any justice. It's a very weak album from such a colossal group.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey Stirling's music is full of passion and dedication.  Her first studio album is self titled and contains 12 tracks 6 are new and 6 are remastered tracks that have been previously released.  This album is simply amazing and I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to experience some of the best music there is.

0316228532|4.0|I loved how J.K. Rowling fleshed out each character. Two-thirds into the book I was thinking about how their lives were unfolding as I went through my day as if I too were a resident of Pagford and they were real people. I look forward to more from Rowling. She's a great writer.

B008CJ8S0A|1.0|I wonder, wonder, wonder what is it that the listener \\" Santa Fe\\" heard in this less than average, mundane and banal reading of one of the most overplayed and, arguably, one of the greatest piano concertos ever written? Mr. Trifonov is not only a mediocre player, but also a \\"musician\\" without any personality or individuality, a below average conformist, an excellent student of the instrument and, (it seems by hearing this recording), he is bound to remain that for  years and years to come. To say that his talent is modest is to grossly overestimate this young man. His talent is at best instrumental, he has basically very little, if anything, to say with his playing, particularly in Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto. To compare him (in superiority) to Kissin's talent is nothing but to completely misunderstand the very basics of music and music making. Kissin's performance of 2 Chopin concerti at age 12 are, arguably, still unsurpassed - an achievement which Trifonov could only dream of in his wildest dreams. True it is, that Kissin never arrived at better performances than when he was 12! But Mr. Trifonov has never reached the level of profoundness and musical maturity Kissin exhibited at 12!, and Mr. Trifonov is much older at the moment. He will never reach 12-year-old Kissin's maturity level!! Never! So, there is not much to listen to in this recording. The \\"great\\" maestro Gergiev is not a big contributor either, mostly rushed, unsophisticated, unsupportive and not transparent. The orchestra playing is inconsistent and ad hoc at best, sometimes even rather careless (no wonder!!): Mariinsky Orchestra/Gergiev and some winner of Tchaikovsky Competition!!<br />Here we go, dearest \\"Santa Fe listener\\". Better get yourself some real great performances of this (Tchaikovsky First) and other works by some REAL pianists and orchestras, preferably, NOT competition winners, (who you seem to hold in such great esteem!!) because these are a dime a dozen these days!! There are so many, both Russians and non-Russians who really CAN play Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto and other works on this CD!! This CD is not worth the price. Once can have much better accounts for half the price or even less!!many, both Russians and non-Russians who really CAN play Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto and other works on this CD!!

0316228532|5.0|J.K. Rowling has written here one of my favorite type of stories: loads of characters seemingly disconnected, yet their stories come together in intricate ways.  Some reviewers aren't comfortable with the many characters whose moral codes are in the grey area at best, but I think that's what makes this a great novel.  Rowling has weaved together delicious drama and interpersonal conflict in her first adult novel, and I will continue to read anything she publishes!<br /><br />During the first 80 pages, I did find it difficult to organize the many characters into a working knowledge of Pagford's citizens, but eventually all comes together.  I found myself rooting for a particular character one moment, and wishing malice on them the next.  I love that Rowling put together plenty of emotional conflict with each character and left us to sort out our individual issues with them.<br /><br />This novel is heartbreaking while at the same time having plenty of love to share.  I am a satisfied fan!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought the plot of the book seemed intriguing.  What happens when a loved one disappears?  How does one feel?  How does one react and cope?  Gone Girl answered all these questions.  Amy and Nick seemed to be the perfect couple. When Amy disappeared on their fifth wedding anniversary, I found myself sympathizing with her husband Nick.  As the book went on, I found my opinion of both Nick and Amy changing. Who was the real victim?  It showed me that evil comes in many forms and not where we always expect to find it.  If I were to say more, it would give away an ending I did not foresee when I first started reading.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|I bought this for my son, who is 21 yrs old.  Surprising that he likes some of the same music I grew up on. Anyway, he loves this CD and plays it all the time. Came quickly and was priced right.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|This was a great book. i recommend it to everyone! it makes you really appreciated your life and everyone you have in it
B00003CWPL|5.0|Eraserhead is a very original and provocative film (though not for everyone) and it arrived in good shape.  The movie could have been shortened but it was visually unforgettable.  Fast delivery.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|if you haven't seen the alien anthology or don't care, don't watch this movie. the visual effects are amazing. its a prequel to the first alien movie what else do want?<br />it was entertaining and scary. if you don't think it was, you are desensitized.

B000001ESP|5.0|What a classic album! This album, along with 2112 are Rush's signature releases. Of course, the opening track (Tom Sawyer) is a household name in rock's greatest songs. With Neil's famous drum fills, Geddy's keyboards/synths and Alex's awesome guitar solo, this song put the group on the map for good. The next track, Red Barchetta, is another classic up-tempo song that has a choppiness to it, and is different with all of its speed changes. The next track, YYZ, is a showcase of musical instrument diversification, with each member getting to show off their talents. I particularly like Neil's use of percussion in this one, as well as Geddy's keyboards. The next track, Limelight, is another household name with perhaps Alex's greatest guitar work, especially the solo. The next track, The Camera Eye, adds some city sound effects, and the music itself has a certain far-away yet nostalgic sound to it, and is very good. The next track, Witch Hunt, is somewhat underrated in my opinion. I absolutely love this song with its powerful and eerie intro, as well as Geddy's keyboards/synths and bass work. This song stands out from the rest on this album, as far as being different. The last track, Vital Signs, is another choppy song with cool synths and a very catchy chorus that's very unique. Overall, this album represents Rush at their creative peak, and is a must-have in any CD collection. Geddy's vocals are toned down for the first time on this album. 10/10
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|You know what, I'll tell the truth.  I couldn't even finish this book.  The idea that this kind of man turns so many women on, quite frankly, disgusts me.  This guy is one tiny step away from beating HER up.  Heck, he might actually proceed to doing that in the pages I didn't read.  And if she actually REDEEMS him or whatever in the end, well guess what?  That doesn't happen in real life.  You find a man like this, you leave him, because he will not change, and he will cause you absolutely nothing but heartache.  And possibly bruises.  And broken bones.  Etc.  Please, please, quit reading this drivel, and in your own personal life, go for the good guy, the nice guy, because THAT's who you're gonna want to have around when you're 70.

1449410243|5.0|I had to know what the Bobcats did on Saturday, so I bought this book and I was not disappointed! Not only do I know what the Bobs do on Saturdays, but now I can protect myself by watching for warning signs that my cat is plotting to kill me! But on a serious note, the book is really worth it. Besides there being new material that is not online, the quality of the printing is great! I wasn't expecting the book to be that well made, I just wanted it to make me laugh, but it did/was both! If you like the Oatmeal, you'll love this book!

B009AMABH6|2.0|This movie tries so hard to be something.<br />I might know what that was if I'd have read the book, but that shouldn't be prerequisite for seeing a movie.<br />This film is a waste of time, if was painful to slog through to the end; don't bother, there's no satisfaction waiting at the end of the tunnel, cut your losses and spend your time more wisely, cut your fingernails.

B007SGM084|5.0|This book keeps you on the edge of your seat.  You never know what Christian Grey is going to do. I love it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read this novel bit by bit, usually right before I went to sleep. I don't think it improved the quality of my sleep. It is spooky, disturbing, clever, well-written and it's own screwy way believable--maybe until the end. But even that is believable within the context of the whole story. A back and forth narrative on what it means to be in a compelling and difficult relationship. A good read.
B007VYAJAE|5.0|This documentary gives you a detailed summary of Bob Marley's life and the struggles of his time. I highly recommend watching it!!!
0439023521|4.0|The Hunger Games is an original concept which seems to have inspired other stories to follow suit. The book was very easy to read, and the words just flew off the pages without causing too many road blocks. The characters were believable too. I give the Hunger Games two thumbs up. Just don't watch the movie.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|This is a  Book that i have heard so much about but never read because it isn't really my type of book.  I found it on Kindle for free with audio so it could read to me.  I was surprised that I truly liked it.  Plus now I will not feel so left out when a joke or comment is made regarding this book!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I was skepital at first about this series.  I thought, \\"how can a series TV show based on zombies keep the audience interested?\\"  However, I was quite surprised.  The show pulled me in right from the start.  And, it's not just about 'the walking dead', it's about survival.  What would one do to continue to survive if the world was almost inhabital?
B0053O89JM|5.0|Sorry to see this show leave the air. One of the best shows on TV. It will be missed by many.
B0088TG252|2.0|We enjoy both of these actors, but feel the story got lost with all the fighting/action scenes...they went on and on and on....actually got up and did dishes waiting for a fight scene to get over-  over the top..was disappointed.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Anyone who has watched the series must read this book. Slight differences here and there but overall more intriguing then the series itself. Cant wait to finish this book and the next book so i see more into the story then the series entails

B0091TGWYE|4.0|Just as another reviewer had written this case does not fit the iPhone 5, as they explained it states right on the package \\"Samsung\\".  It also took 13 days to receive this product with no tracking #. Look somewhere else people, mine is being returned.<br /><br />UPDATE<br />company did contact me, and really put out effort to send me the right case. I understand mistakes happen.<br /> The iphone 5 case arrived and is quite nice, its a tight fit, and quality leather. Its high quality. Buy it!

B003VANOFY|5.0|These headphones are baller.  I previously had the turtle beach 5.1 dolby surround headset, which were great, but I had two pairs of them snap on me.  This pair of headphones are super comfortable, use metal to reinforce the headband, have great sound, and pretty awesome.  The only downside is the 100+ pricetag attached.

B004XZR63M|3.0|As the author of[..] I know a thing or two about financial info-products, such as what makes them good, bad, worth buying and reading or just skipping over.    The first 90 pages of this book gives solid philosophies about money such as knowing the difference between assets and liabilities and using your money to acquire assets. He goes over the importance of making and reading income statement and balance sheets, but today, we have Mint.com that does that for us. He also talks about how the world has changed from being an industrial-based economy to an information-based economy, why being the smartest kid in school or the hardest working employee at the office won't make you rich. All of which is true.    Unfortunately, the second half of the book contains generic and sometimes unrealistic advice, making it sound like a typical real estate investment seminar pitch. He recommends flipping real estate as a way of getting rich citing numerous personal experiences. Like one time where he made $40,000 in just 5 hours. He also states that inventing something is a good way to get rich, which of course it is, but that's a very unspecific kind of advice you probably already knew before reading the book. It also fails to give out specific strategies and tactics about investment philosophy or tools to help you manage your money. There is also some dispute over the truth of the story. Kiyosaki's rich dad may have never even existed.    It is however a quick and interesting read. Rather you agree with everything the author has to say or not, it's worth the read (and the price) because it gives a unique perspective. His views on stocks, in particular, are not what most people would agree with. However, the general premise - and a lot of the views on how to achieve \\"success\\" in life are worth examining. If nothing else, this book will provoke some thought and that's what made me feel was worth the purchase.    If you're someone that prefers to learn by reading stories over methods, this may be the book for you. Three stars for Rich Dad, Poor Dad.

0066620996|3.0|As the author of [...], I know a thing or two about financial info-products such as what makes them good, bad, worth buying and reading or just skipping past. This one is well worth the read. As a small business owner this is a great book to read. This book gave me a great insight as to what is need to become successful and also what is need in order to become an overall great company.    Collins clearly describes the six stages that companies must have if they want to go big. The ideas that are given in this book will stimulate your leadership sense and perhaps it will enable you to bring your company ahead of the competitors.    There is however one flaw with the book. Collins praises Fannie Mae as one of the great companies because they \\"grasped the subtle denominator of profit per mortgage *risk level*,\\" and \\"then it makes money selling insurance and managing the spread on that risk.\\" Sure that sounds like a good way to make money, but it proved to be a grossly irresponsible practice that contributed largely to the global financial crisis.    Still, I would recommend this book for a beginner/intermediate as it will help you recognize problems and point you in the right direction. Three stars for Good to Great.    Less Jargony: Yes    Specific and Detailed: Yes    Motivational: Yes    Easy to Read: Yes    Will you learn something new: Yes
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Of all the battery apps I've used this is the best so far.<br />The graph seems to be very accurate. Just look at the charging rate as it approaches a full charge.<br />Good developers offer a free version so you can see the app to decide if it works for you.<br />The battery at the heart of your device. The long term chart should let you monitor your battery as it degrades over time.<br />$2.00 for an app you use every day is very reasonable.<br />Support the developer and they can improve the app even more and modify as technology changes.<br />Low ratings because a version costs $2.00 and there is a free version is both unfair to the developer and very immature. Just because the free version has &quot;most&quot; of the features is no reason to poorly rate this app.<br />I hope the developer expands into Apple's products because I would buy it for my iOS devices without hesitation.

B003SNJYSK|3.0|Good written and thrilling, but not as good as the first two books of the Harry Hole series. I am not a big fan of the WWII which might is the reason for the poor review. He is going back and forth between the time during the WWII and now. You don't expect the ending and I didn't put it away even on the last pages. But hopefully the next one is about a theme I can relate more to.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book was suspenseful,captivating and haunting.  I found myself thinking about the characters throughout the day. The book was very worth reading

B00846REIS|5.0|I had read the other popular book and fell in love with Christian. When a friend told me about this series she had said how she thought Gideon was better than Christian.  I didn't believe her.  Well if we had bet I would have lost because she was right.  The story does have similarities in that they are both rich controlling men who fall in love but other than that I don't think you can compare.  The interaction between the two makes you fall in love with him. The sex scenes are steamy and not kinky at least in the FSOG sense and they are always different, not always doing the same things.<br />  I think anyone who's read FSOG would love this one the same if not more! Don't miss out on this love story.
B004WKH4PS|4.0|I do absolutely love this movie and Joan Crawford does an amazing job as Mildred, yet I do have one issue. I hate paying 2.99 to rent a movie for 48 hours. I'm a broke college student, and I feel like 1.50$ would be a better price even.
1451662432|5.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger could write an entire anthology detailing his life achievements. From bodybuilding to acting to politics to business, Schwarzenegger has run the gambit on professions and has managed to climb to the top of each. His new memoir, Total Recall: My Unbelievably True Life Story, was expected to be just that: a story of successes. As it turns out, it's anything but. The book can be simplistically divided into 5 sections; Arnold's childhood, his career in bodybuilding, his career in film, his time in office, and his personal life. While these topics are intermixed throughout, Total Recall gives readers the opportunity to see how everything Schwarzenegger does relates to and builds upon events from his past.<br /><br />Growing up in a small town in Austria, Total Recall details the many struggles Schwarzenegger faced, including an overbearing and bitter father, and goes into great detail about certain events in his young life that shaped who he is today. His childhood, while intriguing, wasn't all that exceptional, as he points out. Born shortly after the end of WWII, the adults that surrounded Arnold (and most everyone else in Austria) considered themselves `losers', having lost everything with the fall of Hitler and the Third Reich. The promises of riches and a vast empire were gone. Left was hopelessness and anger. Schwarzenegger shares with his readers how he was able to overcome the loser mentality, develop the larger-than-life ego for which he is known, and escape Europe to eventually come to America.<br />Of course, his arrival into America wouldn't have been possible without bodybuilding, a sport in which he is still revered even to this day. In the book, Schwarzenegger spends a great deal of time giving readers an inside look into his bodybuilding beginnings, his training methods, and the events leading up to his trove of world championships. He also discusses topics that have been the subject of speculation for decades, including his use of steroids and drugs. Building on what he started in The Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding, Schwarzenegger takes the stance that becoming the most muscular man in the world is as much about the psyche as it is about the body, giving readers a rare glimpse into the mind of one of the greatest athletes of all time.<br /><br />Total Recall also, expectedly, gives readers the inside scoop on many of Schwarzenegger's films, including Pumping Iron, The Terminator, and Twins. While the anecdotes and behind-the-scenes stories make for a good read, more enjoyable are the tales of hard work, negotiation, and relationship building that led Arnold into his most famous roles. Equally intriguing is Schwarzenegger's business savy that, as he puts it, drove him to `turn one dollar into two' and amass an impressive fortune. He confesses that making movies eventually grew old and that he was ready for a new challenge. This restlessness eventually led to him running for Governor in the historic California Recall Election of 2003.<br /><br />Most of what readers will find in the chapters about his time in office reads exactly like it should, a political drama. Schwarzenegger describes the opposition he faced from the Democratic legislature, the White House, and even from members of his own party. He is careful to discern between political disagreements and personal ones and points out that his time as Governor, while not underscored with exceptional approval ratings, was the greatest professional accomplishment he has ever achieved.<br /><br />All of these things, though, pale in comparison to the details of Arnold's personal life that are intermixed throughout the book. From the death of his brother Meinhard to his father's Nazi ties, Total Recall  holds nothing back in the way of embarrassing situations and all-around screw-ups, the biggest of which was fathering a child out of wedlock and causing his marriage to crumble. Also included are relatively unknown details about Arnold's emotional side. Readers are left with a true sense of the love and dedication Schwarzenegger feels towards his family. Also apparent is the undying devotion he has to the United States, the place that gave him, an immigrant, `everything'. Through it all, though, two of Arnold's most well-known qualities shine through: optimism and humor. This is none more apparent than when he describes first meeting his wife and immediately blurting out to her mother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, that `(her) daughter has a great ass'.<br /><br />Arnold Schwarzenegger is a rare specimen. Few individuals in history have a past as interesting and diverse as he with a resume to match. Total Recall is a story about a man with a machine-like drive, unyielding optimism, and an uncanny ability to get others to do what he wants done. Punctuated with humor, confidence, sadness, and an superhuman ability to think big, Total Recall is a must-read for fans of Schwarzenegger and the American Dream.

1597801585|5.0|This book is creepy, depressing, disturbing, and amazing.<br /><br />The characters are all finely crafted, with the precision of fine watches.  They are built together as products of a scary world that seems all too likely when one looks at the headlines.  Sometimes you find sci-fi writers who are good with science, with world building, or with characters, but in The Windup Girl, Paolo Bacigalupi shows that he can do all three simultaneously and with style.  This review may end up rather short if only because the book deserves high praise for its construction and reviews that just say \\"this is very good\\" a million different ways are ultimately boring.<br /><br />In style, Bacigalupi likes to write dark worlds in a way that doesn't pull punches.  These scenes may be difficult for you to deal with.  He writes a dark and difficult world without apologizing or hiding any of its dark difficulties.  Death is frequent, common, and easy to find for people living in this post-industrialist society.  As are exploitation and assault.  Every character has a unique angle, and every character must balance their higher motives with their selfish drives.  In short, every character is very real.<br /><br />Furthermore, the research and worldbuilding are impeccable and the understanding of plant biology and biotechnology expressed by the author are unparalleled.  Many science fiction writers seem to be afraid of writing speculative biology, adding it either as an afterthought to their future worlds, or ignoring it entirely.  Bacigalupi breaks away from this pack with his deep knowledge and forecasting of biological capabilities.  His passion and understanding of the field drive through the darkness and depth of his characters to stimulate the intellect at the same time as he stimulates emotional mind with his story.<br /><br />This is a real masterwork.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|This review is based on the Amazon Instant Video HD version (I mention this because you don't get the extra material at the end in the Standard Def. version) I can't believe all the people that said they are big fans of the Alien movies that said this movie has nothing to do with that series. The Aliens in this movie are the same aliens that were found in the first movie. I'm referring to the dead alien found in the pilots chair inside the alien space ship. They don't look the same because the alien in the first movie was wearing a space suit. The same space suit that is seen at the first encounter with the aliens in this movie. To make this more clear, in this movie  there are 2 alien life forms in the movie. A human like alien and a monster like octopus alien that starts out like a worm. This movie takes place before the first Alien movie. Another misconception is the one where the humans had touched the alien goo, and how dumb that was. Watch the movie again but more closely this time. It's the android that does all the touching of the alien substances . I didn't see this movie in the theater because of all the criticisms. And I have to admit that the previews made the movie look dumb. But after I saw it I thought it was mostly misunderstood. But I had the advantage of reading the reviews and I was looking for what was said regarding the dumb things that were reported. As my title says, after the credits there are scenes that were cut out and should not have been that show a more recognizable alien bursting through the chest of the human like alien. As stated in the first Alien movie, these creatures take on DNA from their host that changes their appearance. So what you see in this movie as far as the octopus like creature becomes the aliens that were in all the other movies. I've got enough spoilers in my review and I'm sorry for that but I thought there was to much confusion (and intentional misdirection from Dir. Scott) to just review the movie. There have been a number of poorly made Alien Vs Predator movies recently and that's probably why Mr Scott said that this wasn't another Alien movie like the previous ones.<br /> So do I recommend this movie? Well if you know the difference between interesting SIFI and Horror SIFI, then I would say it's good interesting SIFI. But if your looking for a movie more like Aliens where the monster aliens eat everybody, or turn them into incubator's hanging from slim covered walls, and lots of machine gun action and space marines then your out of luck. Mr Scott has made a movie that's more like there were no other sequels to Alien until this one. I would suggest anyone that wants to make more sents of this movie watch the first one again, then this one and rather then paying close attention to the action, and all the other visual attractions, listen to and remember what's being said. you'll find there some interesting connections.
0439023513|3.0|At about the point that Katniss shot down a warplane with a bow and arrow, this book became completely unbelievable for me and I was reading it just to finish it.<br /><br />It's certainly dramatic.  Beloved characters die, dramatically.  Left and right.  But overall, the book just doesn't make sense.  Why plan your revolution around the winners of a television competition that doesn't involve any kind of battlefield strategy?  Why let teenagers in on your big strategy councils?  Why fight for a system of government that's even worse than the Capital's?  The motivations and strategies of the book's protagonists are confusing at best and nonsensical at worst.<br /><br />Added to the fact that I just can't root for the nation represented by the good guys, given its equally totalitarian nature when compared to the Capital, a lot of my enjoyment of this book was sapped.<br /><br />That said, it still has great action scenes and is a must-read if you want to complete the Hunger Games series.  But it's a disappointment compared to the first and second books, that's for sure.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Perfect ending to the 50 series just beautiful! I do believe that this book couldnt get any better E L James wrote this book to perfection. You couldnt have ended it any better. I would love to see more from 50s pov but even without its perfection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've not see the movie yet, but the story is too good and immersive! I am not a native reader, but still can appreciate the text. Great story!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is awesome a great begining to the series as soon as i finished it i instantly bought the 2nd one. These books are awesome. I just fell in love with not only the chemistry but the love and trials and how they test each other how without knowing it they make each other grow n mold each other into a compatable cersion of what each other really want. It is perfectly written and well thought out and i just freaking love it!!!!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I thought it was a decent follow-up from Bared To You. I will admit that i enjoyed the 1st book much more. This was good but I was expecting a better story line. It became repetative  and crude. I was a bit disappointed considering the 1st book was amazing, i pre-ordered  this in advance and it cost $10..... most of my $5 books are  better.<br /> If you liked the Fifty Shades Trilogy or Gabriel‘s inferno/Gabriel ‘s rapture..... you will enjoy this read!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I love this book!! I cannot say it enough...i love it. I love travis and his entire character from his tough reputation to his soft romantic sweet lovey side...i love how he loves abby..i love abbys character she seems so sweet an innocent but u learn a lot about her later and u just love her character even more and the relationship she has with travis. This book os just my favorite and i will always love it..i am head over heels excited for walking disaster(beautiful disaster from travis' point of view) i know i will love it and i just cannot wait. YOU NEED TO READ THIS BOOK!
B007UWBQEU|5.0|I got this album for only one song, but found more favorites! I do like the majority of her songs.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Ok so as soon as i finished book 1 i instantly bought this one. I was addicted to 50 shades i could not put them down...i even abandoned laundry amd cleaning and stopped feeding my boyfriend bc i read all day. At the time i was doing easy work at work and read all day while i worked. These books are awesome and can not wait to see how they go about making these movies!
B00913DPW2|5.0|If you want a fun game that is full of puzzles and makes you think along with a decent story line this is one I'd highly recommend! It's actually the first game I've ever reviewed...so that says something too.
B007THA4FI|3.0|This book really dragged at the beginning. The introduction of so many characters made them very hard to keep straight. I think I finally got most of them into my head about halfway through the book. It was just a story about a typical small town and its problems with a sad ending. Definitely not worth the price. I sincerely hope that Ms Rowling does not continue this story (because I could see an opportunity for a sequel) in her next attempt at an adult novel.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|After just finishing this book this evening, I am too emotional to write about it!  I loved it.  It's an incredible book.  I highly recommend this book.  It's just plain beautiful.
B009329ZF2|5.0|This movie was better than I expected. I really enjoyed it. My older children liked this movie as well, definietly something we can watch again.
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|Good,  solid fun.  Game keeps you thinking.  Not so much you can't have a time wasting diversion ,  but enough that you don't feel too committed.
B005OZE9SA|4.0|Purchased to provide professional level I/O for recording from mixers etc.<br /><br />Works very well for that purpose; also and probably especially useful as location recorder with just a laptop and condenser microphone(s). The bus powered connection is as simple as it can possibly get, and the package is about the size of a fat paperback book. Inputs provide for microphone(phantom powered or not), instrument, balanced line on TRS, and balanced line on XLR connector.<br /><br />Tested with bass and guitar via instrument input also sounded very good indeed, and dead silent. Output of high quality material also sounds superb ... and compares well with other very high quality gear. Everything about this unit is a cut above the units from its competitors in this (crowded) price point.<br /><br />Though lacking lots of the I/O and routing options you get with more expensive units, this device, unlike most other products in this price range, has a quality feel to its enclosure, jacks and controls. Drives headphones, even inefficient ones, to satisfying levels cleanly.<br /><br />The input controls have a helpful feature wherein if you have set things too \\"hot\\" the color changes briefly to red -- helpful to bring your attention to your proper metering (in SW) to adjust your levels.<br /><br />Re computers and drivers: almost all the tests went well. On two laptops running Windows 7, installed the latest drivers from the focusrite web site and initial tests of playback and recording went great. One of these recorded perfectly also. The other, which has a core 2 duo processor (FWIW), had issues recording properly, and no matter which of the three possible usb drivers were installed, and I tried them all, this problem remained. So, for certain windows laptops, you may want to hang onto the receipt until you verify proper operation throughout. This issue is why four starts rather than five.<br /><br />On a happier note this interface \\"instantly worked\\", with absolutely no installation, on a linux desktop running ubuntu studio 12.04 \\"precise\\". So for linux users this may be a very attractive option.<br /><br />Lastly documentation and bundled software is \\"light\\"; this is fine if you know what you are doing but it would not hurt focusrite to provide a bit more substance in their user guide for novices connecting various types of gear - guidance re best practices etc.<br />But this is a nit -- overall a superb value provided your computer interfaces happily.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|pretty good..worked well on kindle fire and typical of big fish. fun for a hidden object game...similar to  mcf and decent graphics
B008FSCNTK|4.0|I am very selective about the music I purchase. Diana Krall and T Bone Burnett's Glad Rag Doll is probably only the fourth or fifth purchase this year--it has been a lean year for albums worth purchasing. I like the album--a lot. It covers a lot of territory and it lifts my spirits and takes me back to a simpler time. I am confused about all the negative comments. Can't an artist explore and try new stuff? Must you have the same sound fed to you each time?
B000068OCS|5.0|I had already seen Koyaanisqatsi once before, courtesy of a friend. Since that one screening, I couldn't wait until I could get it for myself. I've thoroughly enjoyed re-watching it multiple times over. Even to just listen to the soundtrack. Philip Glass is an absolute genius when he composed the score for this movie. It is very much worth every penny. It's a movie that you can watch and re-watch, and there's always something new to see.
B004LROUNG|3.0|I love reading John Grisham,his books are usually great.I found this one to be too slow & pretty boring.I expected better.
1594745692|4.0|I bought this deck because I thought it would appeal to my teenage son (it has) but I've also gotten really taken by it. I brought it to an intuition group meeting to read for others, and it was spot on. I do think it takes a familiarity with zombie pop culture to find resonance with the images, especially if you have a healthy, lighthearted take on the genre.  If you find the images ghastly and morbid, you may not be able to appreciate the shades of meaning in the scenes of the undead interacting with the living. Luckily, one of my favorite flicks is \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" (which may be referenced in cards like the Nine of Hazards' \\"Dead-Mart\\" scene, showing the living with their newly bought zombies on leashes).<br /><br />As a fan of mid-20th century advertising art, which I use liberally in my own collage work, I especially like the Hierophant card which shows a TV news announcer with his genial smile sitting in front of a list of Rescue Stations. The Devil card pictures a bright red cigarette dispenser with those pulls I used to love playing with as a child. It is campy, yes. Have fun with the Zombie Tarot...read the booklet for some tongue-in-cheek reading tips; just don't be surprised by the (almost) dead accurate readings.
B0034G4OYA|4.0|\\"Hotel Transylvania\\" has Count Dracula running a secret mountaintop hotel where all his monster buddies can blow off steam, away from a human world they believe is hostile to monsters.  This year's gathering is special: the (1)18th birthday of Dracula's cute daughter Mavis, who can't wait to get out and explore the world.  Her overly protective father has already lost a wife to an angry human mob and goes to great (and humorous) lengths to keep Mavis around the castle.  An uninvited guest in the form of a hipster young human male backpacker changes all that...<br /><br />The animation is superb.  The cartoon monsters look incredibly life-like as they sing, dance, and squabble.  Among the guests at the hotel are the Mummy and his mate, Mr. and Mrs. Frankenstein, the Invisible Man, the Blob, and the Werewolf and his wife and pile of rambuctious pups.  There is an endless series of sight gags, ripped off from every monster movie ever made.  The excellent voic cast includes Adam Sandler, Kevin James, and Selena Gomez.  All this fun nicely carries the movie, which has a thin and overly long plot. Portions of the movie may be too intense for small children, who may also not get some of the sight gags (well, let's hope so); recommended.
B0094OLFUW|5.0|I love all their work and this album does not disappoint  it is my favorite album this year  I would recommend
B008XDSUNU|5.0|I'm really liking this album - listen to it more than any of the other new ones I have. It has a great feel to it and nice mix of sounds and vocals.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|good story with a twist, made me cry  as I am the mother of a 14year old!! Interesting look into the court system too.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|It's easy to snap on, slim-fitting, and durable...<br /><br />I have had this case for 10 months and I love it!Unfortunately, I dropped my Kindle once =( BUT thank goodness for this case! Not a scratch on my Kindle. =)<br /><br />I think I may purchase another for the color...
1416955070|4.0|A riveting urban fantasy!<br /><br />I don't know what this book has to keep me turning every page of it as soon as I started reading. Every mythical creature you could think of are right here in the City of Bones, and seeing how well they could coexist in one tale is interesting in enough for me.<br /><br />I like the plot how things had fallen into place. But what I really loved about this book are the characters. Jace, anyone? Can I get a \\"Hell Yeah?\\"<br /><br />I agree with the lots of girls who found him lovable. Yes, he's an incredibly conceited, cocky, annoying, arrogant little arse that he is, and he knows it. Unfortunately that doesn't stop him from being charming and humorous. Clary was a character that's rare and I love her way of offsetting what Jace has implied. I do have trouble with Simon though, I can't quite decipher where I place him in my thoughts because somehow he's a little indistinctive and yet there are times he stands out. Luke's story was another thing I held on to thoughtfully, it was nice, sad and sympathizing. Alec, Isabelle, Magnus, even Raphael and everyone else spilt out their significance stylishly and I came to either love them, hate them or love and hate them at the same time.<br /><br />Yes, I will agree that this book had its share of predictability, but clich&eacute;s can be a good thing sometimes; as long as you can throw in something good to counter or add to it, like how Clare has done with this book.
B001EN1R2M|5.0|I remember this CD when I was a kid. Has a lot of great music on it! Stary Eyes is my favorite, they were so young when they did this CD.
1416972242|2.0|I loved the start of this series, City of Bones. But I didn't like City of Ashes as much. Not that it wasn't good, it is actually, but compared to the first book, this was a bit slow. I'm not the type to dawdle with too long suspense; I'm very impatient when it comes to these matters so you'll have to forgive me.<br /><br />City of Ashes was action-packed but everything seemed to just crash in, one after the other, making it so confusing, it had left me with more questions than answers. Obviously, meaning that City of Glass will have to reveal everything to me. It seems kind of a downer. Of course, I will read the third book. I've been eager to read it ever since I started this series. But having what occurred on this book made it seem like a requirement, if you want to know how it ends that is. Where's the pleasure and excitement of finding out what happens next if it's apparently mandatory. No fun! Hmph!<br /><br />Anyways, another thing I didn't appreciate is how Jace seemed to lose his spark. Yes, I know he's heartbroken and all but it's like I'm looking at a totally different person. Seriously, where's MY Jace? But, putting things in perspective, I understand the necessity of his behavior. Nevertheless, it doesn't make it okay! Sorry I'm bitter as Jace was too.<br /><br />I guess that's the good side of this though, I'm highly affected by the characters... okay fine! Mostly just Jace. And that helped me get through this book.
B000669GAI|5.0|What a great CD! Or should I say CDs, there were 2. This is a great collection of a wide time frame by Pearl Jam! Great CD!
1416972250|5.0|One. Four. Three... The three numbers that comes into my mind when I think of City of Glass. It's more than just the simple I LOVE YOU [Jace] LOL!<br /><br />ONE word I keep muttering as I was finishing the book : WOW!<br /><br />FOUR syllable word I said after turning over the last page : IN-CRED-I-BLE!<br /><br />THREE words that can sum up how I feel about this novel : ALL TIME FAVORITE!<br /><br />*Sigh*<br /><br />I've always loved the character of the Mortal Instruments, so I was very pleased to see them grow here in City of Glass. Even though I had uncertainties about the second book, City of Ashes, Clare did not disappoint me here. Everything was just as I wanted it. I love how unpredictable this has turned out to be. Really! There were some events that I just went, \\"Whoa! I did not see that coming!\\" or \\"Wwwwhaaaattt??? No way!\\" or I would just eventually find myself gasping, laughing, giggling or unconsciously be holding my breath. And since I'm such a sucker for happy endings, I love how this ended.<br /><br />As for Clare's writing, it is rather remarkable. Okay, I will yield to those who said there are similarities with J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter. But as one my favorite authors, Shannon Hale, wrote on one of her blogs, when you're starting as a writer/author, you get some of your inspiration from your favorite novels and authors. And sometimes, you'll even write similarly to them, and it's okay because eventually you will find your own writing style. Those aren't her exact words but somehow that's how I understood it. Anyway, my point is I finally saw what she was trying to say through Clare's books, sure, they had somewhat similar notions with the villains, or the recognition of character traits from HP here as well but despite the resemblance, it has its own plot which is unique and captivating.<br /><br />Moving on, I'd just like to say that I have developed an emotional attachment towards this series and I will definitely never forget the experience I've had with reading it.I've had with reading it.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|This book was awesome! It wasn't exactly what I expected which made it even better. I strongly recommend reading it.
0575085304|5.0|I don't have much to say about Graceling. I just absolutely L-O-V-E this book! Kristin Cashore is amazing!<br /><br />I like the characters. The plot of the story was wonderful. The cover rocks! This book was well written and a definite page-turner.<br /><br />I felt like I was Katsa herself as I read throughout Graceling. I did not regret buying this book and I find its price a steal!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Season 7 is so awesome, so much better then season 6. . If u have seasons 1-6 them why not but season 7.. Cuz supernatural is one of the best shows ever
B005LTDPJI|5.0|What else can be said about ELO that hasn't already been said by the other reviewers here?  Great music.  Definitely recommended.  Word of advice, if you live in the United States like me, don't buy from the UK sellers here on Amazon.  The prices may be comparable but, they seem to not know how to pack an expensive boxset for international shipping.  You'll end up with a crushed package like I did.  Just a warning.  Five stars for the music!!!
B007MDB548|5.0|I was able to review this movie last night with the kids and all I can say is that it was an amazing film. The artists at Disney have re-created a beautiful world for the fairies and have introduced a brand new set of fairy friends into the mix. I loved the concept of the movie. I also loved the change from Winter to Summer that was shown in the movie. Tinker Bell shows great sacrifice in the movie, not only for herself, but also for all of Pixie Hollow. This sacrifice provides a great example of what it means to be family and a member of a community. I can say that the whole family thoroughly enjoyed watching this film and I already know that we will be watching it again and again in the months and years to come!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a great book.  Easy read.  A clear and concise detail of the events leading up to and through the killing of Osama.  These men are heroes and it is sad that the current administration is trying to silence them from setting the record straight as to what actually happened.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|the book was very good since the story started to the end. It had me reading it to find out what was going to happen, excelent book
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book picks up where the Hunger Games stopped. It has the same attention to details as the first and keeps you wanting more. Just like the first book when you read the final page you are left thinking WOW. If you've read the Hunger Games Catching Fire is a must read.
B004UID2LC|5.0|it agrees with me I love it and wouldn't trade it with any other apps please get this and always be grateful to it.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Monday night, October 8, 2012 I drove to the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, PA to hear Barbra in concert.  Understand, I am now 63 yo and have loved her since I purchased her first album when I was only 13.  My whole life I vowed to see her in person and this time I said...I'm going to go no matter what it costs!  And it did cost...$138 and we weren't sitting on the floor but in the last row of a section one off the floor...thank goodness for binoculars.  Anyway, this (70) year old gal can still sing and she still has a fabulous body.  The concert was over 3 hours long and I couldn't get enough of it.  Her son Jason sang a few songs and he has all of her mannerisms and for you Jewish women out there, on one song he sang alone and she sat on a chair right next to him and \\"kvelled\\"...you know what I mean.  She is obviously so proud of him now.  It wasn't always that way especially when he came out to her years ago.  He's 45 now and looks great albeit very thin.  I hope that this new CD does not disapoint.  It would be such a let down.  The other night her voice was spot on except my friend and I did notice that she did not hit the mark on a few notes..but hey...this is the first concert tour she has done in 6 years and who knows when and if she will ever do another one.  Being married to James Brolin has certainly done wonders for her skin and body...LOL...<br /><br />Keep it up Barbra.  We still love you after all these years!
B0099G4Y26|5.0|Pink never disappoints. Her music is upbeat and gets you moving. I hope I can catch her in concert somewhere in LA? Have not been able to see her yet.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I can spend hours on this app without realizing it. Amazing ideas, great way to share, can't put it down. Definitely a five star app &amp; website.
B0065FFMR0|2.0|I loved this show. I still love it. I came to Amazon because Netflix doesn't have it at all and FX has removed all of last season's episodes. I don't want to buy one episode or another and I don't want to buy the whole season I just wanna watch the whole season just once. kind of think its crappy there isnt a rent option for tv series on Amazon. I only gave it the bad review because of the fact they don't give the option of renting They could make a bundle off of me charging me 5 bucks for 3 days of this show. (5 bucks to rent all episodes for 3 days) right now i say i would only watch once but in the long run i would probably end up giving them thirty and then buying it at some point. its their loss.<br /><br />Other Than that,<br /><br />Its a great show. Cant wait for the new season to start.
0345803485|5.0|I enjoyed the book, 50 shades of Grey. The pace was perfect with enough tension to keep me turning the pages.<br />The dialogue is good, even great. The exchange between Ana and Christian in the restaurant while the mother is in the bathroom was well done.<br />The sex scenes serve a necessary purpose. They define the perversion and Ana's response to it.  It answers the  question: How far will  Ana  go  to maintain this relationship? And at what cost?<br />There are some over used words such as Holy Shit etc which become redundant, however, they do not distract from the main story.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This is an engaging story with characters of depth.  I found myself immediately looking for the next book in the series to continue where we were left at the end of this book.  If you can get past the strange romance-style cover it's a worthy read for any fantasy reader.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i love this game way too much! it's an awesome free app. no complaints.  I just can't stop playing it.
0140157352|4.0|This is a very unique read and it was the 1st book I ever read on negotiation. It presents very easy-to-understand examples on why you should look past your own ego's need to \\"win\\" and why you should instead get the other person to natrally arrive at your understanding. One problem... you need to know how to let go of your ego. Books that can help with that are [[ASIN:0985923202 something like God: Six Weeks to Spirituality]] and/or [[ASIN:1577314808 The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment]].
B007SGM084|5.0|These books, stories were amazing, I'm starting to read them over and recommended them to so many of my friends and family.<br />Wish there was a movie!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I loved reading her story.  No matter her situation she never gave up hope. She is strong, courageous and survivor.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game and two others from Team Lava it relaxes me and is so much fun! I got 3 of my friends hooked on the game so it is very addictive :)
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book. The psychological aspects of the premise were intriguing and I wanted to keep reading to find out what had happened. I would say that characters and relationships are central to this book - although I was able to broadly predict the ending for me that didn't make the book any less interesting. The intriguing part was that the central character wasn't able to figure out what was going on (due to her amnesia) - I thought the author did a great job of putting the reader in her shoes and showing how her life (and mind) worked.
0060254920|5.0|\\"Where the wild things are\\"  is such a great book for a child's imagination. The pictures are vivid and full of life. I have loved this book since I was a young child and now I have read it to my own children and they loved it as well.  I think this book not only brings out one's imagination, it also shows us the importance's of loved ones and home for young children. I liked how the book displayed how Max disrespected his mother and was sent to his room to reflect on his actions and his thoughts ran wild making his room a forest. Max thought he could escape on his voyage to where the wild things are, but in turn he learned that he wanted to be home with his family. This is a book every child should read!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Lotta questions?  Oh yeah-why does David put the black stuff in the doc's champagne?  Because he disrespected David?  Because he's just curious?  Why does the first guy to get mouth-penetrated by the eel-thing not show up again, but after Noomi gets impregnated by her black-drop-poisoned boyfriend (in the usual way) she produces a quadropus?  And then the quadropus does the mouth thing with the engineer and HE produces the ur-alien?  And what's with all the mucus?  Great special effects, magical computers, workmanlike acting, but I agree that it is difficult to care what happens to any of these people.  I do like that once again a tough, smart woman shall lead them.
B0026O475M|5.0|A great love story.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Whoopi Goldberg recommended this book on The View. She said she couldn't put it down, and I couldn't either. There are a few surprising twists, but the ending was a disappointment.
B008G12ERC|4.0|This album is great but certainly not as incredible as The Resistance, Black Holes & Revelations, Absolution, or many of their older albums. I really wanted to love the heck out of this album because I love Muse. I love their music as a whole, and they put on an absolutely incredible live performance - I'm looking forward to the 2nd Law tour in the US already. My biggest problem with this album is the song Save Me, which, with the vocals (who IS that singing?) and sub-standard quality, it sounds like it's from an old demo tape. Not good. I'm also not a fan of the track Unsustainable, with what seems to be an attempt at dub-step at the intro and end. The unsustainable nature of our society is a worthy subject for a song, but Muse shouldn't try to jump on the dub-step remix bandwagon - Muse should leave that to the dub-step artists and just do Muse do best: rock out! The final and 13th track is equally annoying and nowhere near as beautiful or incredible as the symphonic pieces on The Resistance. This is always the problem when a band puts out an incredible piece... it's hard to follow it up. Buy the album, but skip the DVD set and just buy the CD or download the mp3s. The DVD really wasn't worth the extra cash and is honestly pretty boring. Leaving on a good note though, several of the tracks flat out rock. Overall, the album is enjoyable and worth every penny.
B008G8SFGO|3.0|I will admit this might be Kiss' best new music since 1992's Revenge. However, I can't help but wonder how much better it would have been with a
B0018QQQK8|3.0|After seeing the movie I was anxious to read the book but although very detailed in some areas (at times almost boring thoughts) it was lacking in story substance. Especially in the romantic parts and in anything new that books usually have over movies. I felt the movie covered the story better and the book was a waste of my time and money. Definately disappointing.
B000A3VTT8|5.0|In more recent recordings, there are mezzo-sopranos who fill the role of Angelina wonderfully - Cecilia Bartoli, Elina Garanca, but to name two. Vocally, there are a lot more, from Lucia Valentini Terrani to Jennifer Lamore, and others.<br />But admittedly, to find a singer who looks the part as well as sings the part is sometimes a big stretch for producers. Frederica von Stade is not the vocally strongest Cenerentola, for sure.  Her voice has an unpleasant wimpy quality that she employs far too much in this recording, even in Cenerentola's final triumphant aria, which is a put off.  But her acting is very good, and she makes a wonderful visual pair with Prince Ramiro, unsurpassably performed by Francisco Araiza.<br />Claudio Desderi as Dandini is hilarious and he employs his coloraturas to great buffo effect.<br />The entire cast is fantastic and the direction is truly immaculate, since even the usually stolid Araiza is an animated Prince Charming in this recording.  His characterisation and singing simply beats Raul Gimenez in the Bartoli DVD, and even Juan Diego Florez in the Didonato DVD.<br />This is probably the best shot opera film, as so many have observed.  The scenary and sets are fabulous, and the camera's close-ups of von Stade and Araiza really put many of those currently performing at the MET HD broadcasts to shame, am afraid.<br />A must see, no less.

B002UBRFDC|5.0|I read Shogun many years ago.  The miniseries, with Richard Chamberlain (how that dates it!!) was rebroadcast recently and I enjoyed it as much as i did when it first came out. So, I decided to reread Shogun.  It's still the can't put down, wonderful masterpiece I remembered.
B0070UFMOW|2.0|I wince when I use it.<br /><br />Attached it to an equalizer to identify the frequency causing the harshness. The mid/high range hurts my ears.  The harshness that makes me wince comes from the 4kHz region.  Nothing I can do about it without a separate equalizer.<br /><br />Equipment is Senheiser HD650 plugged into the FIIO E09K.

034580404X|5.0|I had heard about this series, and at first, really wasn't interested in reading it.  However, I was talking with a fellow worker who had just read the first book of the series and told me how she enjoyed it, so I thought I would purchase it myself. I got through all 3 books in about two weeks, and I really didn't want it to end!!!<br />I just loved reading the story of Christian and Ana.  It was excellently written and I really don't have one negative thing to say - only that I wish there was another book, and another. . . . so the story could just continue and wouldn't have to end so soon.  I loved when Ana's \\"Inner Goddess\\" came into play (it just made you chuckle each time) as it was a perfect description of how Ana was feeling each time.  There are so very many feelings you experience in reading these books - much laughter, many tears, sympathy, anger, etc. Please don't miss out on this wonderful story.  I am sure you will LOVE it as I did.

B004LWZW8I|2.0|I see that the reviews on this one are split and I can see why.  I wouldn't give this bloated piece of cinema a 1 star because it is at least sometimes watchable.  But what a grave disappointment it is, especially to those who were hoping to see a movie in the similar vein of \\"300\\".  They do but it is such a lesser entry in every way...<br /><br />First, would it hurt them to use daylight that actually looked like daylight or for the screenwriters to come up with more daytime scenes.  This movie was so dark that you just can't see enough of what's happening at times.  Granted, maybe that was a fault of my video quality as I noticed that on the main screen the movie looked better (!) than it did in the actual movie (I've seen this on a few different movies) largely because there was more light!  Please, people!  In an action movie let us see the action!<br /><br />Second, the story overall is very simple but the execution seemed to try to make it confusing.  Story = evil man with a grudge against the gods is making war with Greece and conquering them and is set to loose the Titans so that they can kill the Olympians; hero, and a small band of unlikely allies, opposes and stops him.  With characters that you can't see clearly half the time trying to give you backstory to make the main story seem more significant, referencing people that you never see and history that is only tangentially related, and you wondering who is saying what leaves the viewer not really caring at some point.<br /><br />Third, (a purely subjective point on my part) it took me out of the movie as I watched the hero use jiu jitsu on a ton of enemies.  I like watching this kind of stuff but I'm just saying...it took me out of it.<br /><br />If there is a redeeming portion of the movie it was in the brutal, bloody, and slow-motion cool fight between the Olympians and Titans.  As another reviewer marked, there was a lot of style there.  The fey looking Olympians (Zeus looks like Orlando Bloom) didn't look a match for the burnt embers of hominid forms that were the Titans but they sure laid a smackdown on them.<br /><br />My final word?  If you haven't already seen \\"Immortals\\" but are really interested in it then, for your own sake, go in with very low expectations.  That way you might kind of like it.t look a match for the burnt embers of hominid forms that were the Titans but they sure laid a smackdown on them.<br /><br />My final word?

030758836X|5.0|Before reading this book, I suggest at least perusing \\"Inside the Mind of Casey Anthony: A Psychological Portrait\\" by Dr. Keith Ablow. I only read through the Casey Anthony book, enough to understand Dr. Ablow's definition of \\"Identity Suppression Syndrome.\\" Though it looks like this book received a lot of negative attention, I was deeply impressed by his analysis of Casey's mind and motivations. I feel that Identity Suppression Syndrome is very real, especially in girls.<br /><br />Then I read \\"Gone Girl\\" which is a brilliant psychological thriller. The main characters are part of Generation X, with a mindset very different from my own current post-hippie perceptions, though I can remember living in LA and being a lot like these people (in a way it was comforting to realize that other people do share this condescending lifeview at certain points in their existence. Before reading Flynn's book I had some uncomfortable memories of myself in my 30s).<br /><br />I don't want to spoil \\"Gone Girl,\\" and I'll just finish by saying that the two books connect, and I walked away from the story feeling that I have a deeper understanding of what it means to be authentic (or not) and the consequences of the choices we make, perhaps unconsciously, concerning who we are in the world.

B000002B2T|5.0|I was in a bar and heard a song that sounded like Layne Staley, and it wasnt Alice in Chains.  I looked at the digital jukebox and saw it was this album Above, by some band called Mad Season.  The song was great, and I immediately purchased the album.  I put the song on my ipod and listened to it, then listened to it again, and overall several more times.  I havent done that with a entire album in quite a while, especially a \\"new\\" one.  The sound and vocals are so amazing, on every track.  Not really one dissapointing song on the entire album.  I just cant believe that I've gone this far and never heard of it before.  Alice in Chains has always been one of my favorite bands.  This album does not dissapoint at all!!!

B005LAIHY0|2.0|The Good:<br />-There have been various opinions about the special effects.  Personally, I thought the visuals and soundtrack were awesome.  They definitely made me favorably disposed towards this film.<br />-Michael Fassbender is spellbinding.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />The main problem with the entire film is that nobody (other than Michael Fassbender) has any plausible motivation for the majority of their behavior.  As a result the entire movie is basically just an exercise in convenience, much like your modern B-movie horror flick.<br /><br />**** COMPLETE SPOILER ****<br /><br />Weyland is old and dying.  A couple scientists convince him our progenitors are located in a specific solar system based on some old cave paintings found in separate locations.  Weyland immediately spends a few trillion on a space ship and fills it full of the most absurd band of miscreants he can find, plus one awesome android, plus himself (shhhh it's an unnecessary secret).  His plan?... become immortal somehow.<br /><br />It's just completely absurd.  Why is he secretly on the ship, instead of just... entirely visibly on the ship?  It's HIS ship.  Why does he think wandering up to these aliens and asking them a few questions is a good route to immortality in the first place?  Honestly his role/quest is entirely unnecessary and should have either been legitimized with SOME sort of evidence, reasoning, or belief structure, or thrown out.  When his quest inevitably and laughably fails even his final quote... is stupid.  We don't care enough about his mission to care about its failure.<br /><br />The four scientists are far more maddening and will be discussed from least maddening to \\"makes me want to curl up into a ball and sob uncontrollably\\" can-of-walnuts crazytown.  We start with the two scientists who discover the... constellation (hold on a minute, why were the aliens pointing out their biological-weapon-factory-planet to a bunch of neandarthals?? A 20,000 year delayed trap?  SENSELESS).  Noomi has \\"faith\\" which is discussed and never legitimized outside of some sad, pithy dreams, but she has very little sense.  She does, however, occasionally react to situations properly.  This occasional legitimate action makes her not completely terrible.<br /><br />Noomi's boyfriend scientist does not react to any situation properly.  First, he takes of his helmet because... Why not?  He gets depressed by finding dead aliens instead of living ones.  He also manages to be a gigantic asshat to the most dangerous character on the ship (Michael Fassbender drips with menace throughout the entire movie).  Afterwards he sees proof that he is infected with some crazy alien eye worms and... ignores it.  Ingenious!  Needless to say when he is torched with a flamethrower nobody cares.<br /><br />Choosing who is worst between the geologist and biologist is kind of like choosing the least appetizing between two liver flukes.  You can't win.  The geologist gets lost in a cave which he MAPPED with his OWN devices.  Furthermore being that he is... I don't know... a GEOLOGIST, why can't he find his way out of a cave?  Meanwhile the biologist, in possibly the most daringly risky action in all of fictional biology, sticks his hand basically INSIDE the mouth of an alien death snake after RUNNING from a \\"possible life form reading\\" in the previous scene.  What lifeform was he imagining previously if he's willing to immediately leap into the mouth of a terrifying, albino snake-beast?  They both die horribly and nobody cares.  I honestly laughed derisively.<br /><br />This is all a long winded way of saying a bunch of stuff happens and nobody cares, seemingly not even the characters in the movie.  The science doesn't make any sense, of course, but I cared a lot less about that than the terrifying senselessness of the story and characters.  Once the movie clunkily transitions into its horror phase there is a feeling of stupid inevitability to every death as the characters one byone run (sometimes quite literally) directly towards their doom.  At the end of the movie (kindly telegraphed by the previews to the movie... thanks marketing!) all I could feel was a general malaise.  This feeling combined with the knowledge that this script could have been fixed for about .01% of the money pumped into special effects left me decidely nonplussed.  This movie could have been one of the best Sci Fi epics of all time; instead it's a laughable farce.  Worth watching once just for Michael Fassbender and the aforementioned effects, or lots of times if you liked Transformers...
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this is a great game for all ages. I spent hours playing this I just wish it didn't take so long to build up the coins.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|With the tag line, \\"Everything will be alright in the end and if it is not alright it is not the end\\" we are assured that there will be no tragedies in this movie. Most older people have had enough tragedies in their real lives not to need to see others suffer for entertainment. Real life almost never lives up to the promises and we are lucky if we end up somewhere that is at least interesting and interested in improvement. So even with the cliched characters, unlikely coincidences and improbably timed events it is a pleasure to watch this group struggle to deal with the situation as it is. Even the inevitable death is well timed to avoid complications.<br /><br />This movie has hardly left my DVD player since I bought it a few days ago. I have researched locations and the ages of the actors online and watched Evil Under the Sun where a younger Maggie Smith plays a very different type of innkeeper. So I had to give it 5 stars even though I recognize the flaws. There are a few places that I now skip over and others that always amuse me. I recommend pausing the DVD to check out the \\"Have you lost your vigor\\" poster in the clinic when Norman goes to get a little help. When Sunaina suggests to Evelyn that she imagine her listeners naked I am inclined to suspect that I would be unable to speak because I would be staring at her brother Jay (Sid Makeer) with my mouth open.<br /><br />If there is a cliche that irritates me here it is the idea that one must have a lover to be happy. This is exemplified when Madge Hardcastle confides that she is afraid that she is no longer attractive to men and \\"what else is there\\"? The answer is \\"lots of things\\". This may be why several people have found the characters of Madge and Norman less satisfying than the ones who have other interests. Rather than simple wish fulfillment the others find new truths and competencies. Douglas discovers that he can be handy, Evelyn and Muriel discover that they still have value and Graham learns that hehas been living with an assumption that has cost him a lot of pain. Even the dreadful Jean learns what she really wants.<br /><br />And so all who live do so happily ever after.
B001JL5JS2|5.0|I was told by a friend to check out this series and I was hooked on the first season and went on to watch season 2 and 3. I'm now anxiously awaiting season 4 to become available for free prime streaming...can't wait!!
B00887490Y|1.0|and considering how many terrible movies I have seen that says a lot. Not since viewing \\"The Watchmen\\" have I ever been so upset after sitting down to watch a movie. This movie is about nothing but wasting 1hr and 30minutes of your life. I actually stopped the video to check and see how much longer it was going to be and my heart sank to see another 39 minutes on the players clock.<br /><br />Why would an innocent movie starring Jessica Biel be so bad? Well I'll just say it as best as I can without providing any spoilers for those interested in punishing themselves by watching this film. The movie is on the same level as The 6th sense, The Others, Willy Wonka (ok I'm kidding about that one) where you watch the movie and at some point it's like \\"haha I fooled you, you thought it was going to be like this but it's really like this\\". Pretty much it's like an M.Night Shyamalan mind \\"screw\\" film. Except the twist isn't needed because the story never made any sense to begin with.<br /><br />The movie is about a poor town recovering from the Post Bush/Mid Obama era and for whatever reason children have been disappearing from the town over the years. Legend has it that someone called \\"The Tall Man\\" takes them. However you can forget the \\"tall man story\\" because that plot ends about half an hour into the film when it turns into a crime drama, and then at the end some kind of poetic notion to make you think (think about why did you just waste your time watching this nonsense).<br /><br />Honestly you just feel cheated watching this flick. Why you asks? Because you expect to see a horror film and this is not a horror film. It's like some type of \\"horror\\"film a hipster would make before it went mainstream. In this movie \\"Society\\" is supposed to be the monster and the \\"children\\" are the innocent victims supposed to be the ones that need to be saved so they don't become corrupted by society. This isn't a horror movie, it's some type of political statement and it's a pointless one.<br /><br />Some people complained about the ending of this movie. I'm not sure what they were expecting. Me personally I was expecting to see \\"Congratulations You Have Made It To The End Of This Movie\\" flashing across the screen. As I'm sure many others stopped halfway through it as I wish I did. I still will never understand why terrible movies are always LONGER than they need to be.<br /><br />**********Edit Update****************<br /><br />I called this one of the worst movies I have watched and I would like to retract that statement. I have just seen Paranormal 2 and now I am thankful to have seen this bad movie. Paranormal 2 is so bad it makes other terrible films look like masterpieces.

One other thing, this movie was well \\"directed\\", but I wish they had lengthened the movie by about 20-30 minutes, because at the end I was left wanting MORE!

There have been no confirmed purchases,  no YouTube videos,  no ebay listings ,ad every gamestop I call has no idea what I'm talking about.  I've been waiting for an android controller since  the g 1. This one seemed like the best bet. But other companies are also starting to come out with controllers now too.  And gametel is finally under 100 bucks. Even nykos Twitter said recently that this would be releassd for the holiday. Sorry Nyko.  Big fan but what the hey? Watching this 'availability' date get pushed back 2 and 3 days at a time everytime it gets close. And we have one obviously fake review that appeared the day of the supposed release date. Really wanted this controller but I give up.  At least give us a real release date.  Toys r us and other companies have already said they were gonna be stocking the moga in a week or so. I'll definately change my review of this thing ever comes out. But for now it seems unlikely.  There is just no info anywhere on this thing,  even though its already out.  Purchase cancelled

I'm a fan of the supernatural and this period piece/ ghost story is an utter delight.  There's laughter and tears from an endearing plot woven with mystery.  I also giggled with glee, seeing Maggie Smith pop up in this as she does in so much of his work and her character as another matriarch of the family, will win you over.

030736108X|5.0|Harry Hole, former detective with Oslo police detective, has been away from the city for quite some time. He returns to the city in order to aid the son of his former lover. Oleg has been imprisoned on the charges of murdering a drug dealer. Though the murder weapon was never found, there are enough circumstantial evidences pointing at Oleg for the local police to look no further than him. But Harry has a personal interest in this case and thus, even though the police refuse to help him - to them the case is solved - he delves into it on its own. But there's someone else who doesn't want Harry back in Oslo. Who is it and why?<br /><br />When I got this book for review, I realized that this is the 9th book in the series. So, obviously I did a little bit of background research so that I had a bit of idea about what to expect - because obviously in a series, even in stand-alone titles featuring the same protagonist, the character slowly develops. Information is slowly provided over each title. I mean you cannot expect to know everything about Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple or Sherlock Holmes by reading a single story, can you? Jo Nesbø's website actually has Harry Hole's Curriculum Vitae! Frankly speaking I wasn't impressed - I mean who thinks Mel Gibson's `Braveheart' is complete rubbish? Who??<br /><br />So, needless to say that I was not very excited about the book when I finally picked it up. I shouldn't have been apprehensive! Jo Nesbø had me from the very first paragraph of the very first chapter. To say it was gripping would be a gross understatement. The pages seemed to keep turning on its own accord and before I knew, I was done reading it. The plot has murder, conspiracies, drug cartel, getting back with lost love and a `phantom' man, in short, everything interesting. Without giving out any spoilers, I can say you also get a glimpse at true `animal instinct' and that completely blew me away. The pace that the story has is also exactly perfect. It is neither too fast nor too slow. The author has provided enough information in the book to put a first time reader like me at ease and `in' the story. There are a number of twists and I think it is pretty safe to say that guessing them all right is pretty impossible. At the center of it all is this weirdo (Sorry, still upset about the Braveheart thing) who is absolutely surprising in a very pleasant way. Harry Hole has taken me with surprise with the many shades of his characters. Though I was completely disturbed by the ending, obviously because I did not see it coming, it was interesting to be able to get into his mind. There's certain darkness in him that actually makes him good at what he does - kinda like Batman.<br /><br />Also, I have to acknowledge the translator, Don Bartlett. He has done a great job.<br /><br />Would I read his other books? Hell yeah. And do I recommend this book - Yes, yes, yes! Go get your copy while I am off to get myself the previous books in the Harry Hole Series.too fast nor too slow.

B008G8SFGO|5.0|After Sonic Boom I thought KISS was dead. That album was so lethargic and unimpressive, I had to listen to it twice just make sure I got the right CD. I couldn't imagine the band falling so low. With the announcement of another KISS record, I was decidedly indifferent. Then I heard a couple of full length tracks the band released the other day and I had to say I was inspired. I picked up the CD today and was not REMOTELY prepared for the music awaiting me as the disc played. This is, hands down, the best KISS record in the past 30 years. The compositions are there. The riffs are all inspired by early '70's rock n roll and they do not disappoint. The entire record is a complete celebration of the roots of 70's rock music without a single ballad in the mix. And everyone gets their chance to shine. Eric absolutely shines with the song \\"For the love of rock n roll\\". Tommy Thayer finally begins to shine with his own polish of guitar playing instead of copying Ace. And his style is right what the band needs here. Excellent execution. Paul and Gene who typically take the lead spend alot of time sharing the mic on songs and the results are absolutely outstanding. From the Lynyrd Skynyrd feel of \\"Eat Your Heart Out\\" to \\"Shout Mercy\\", these veteran rockers show why they remain a legitimate force in rock music today. H*ll, even Rolling Stone magazine loves it! I hope the band scores a number one hit. They have earned the honor.

B005LAIHY0|2.0|Prometheus, the space ship filled with scientists, intrigue and deception, sets out to find the creators of the human race.  Somehow, from five or six random circles on old cave murals, humans find the path to a place light years distant (which is a heckuva lot farther than the \\"half billion miles\\" the woman in charge, Vickers, claims).  Beware of plot giveaways in the following, although I don't think any of them is significant.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine a more unbelievably dopey crew than this one.  When they discover that the founder race's folks are dead, the male scientist goes on an extended drinking binge.  What a dumb slob.  He wanted to talk to the creators, and when he couldn't he took non-stop to the bottle.  Which also indirectly led to his downfall.  If he'd thought for about 2.7 seconds he'd realize that the master race is quite likely still alive, even if its crew on this planet is dead.  Then there's the Laurel and Hardy duo which turns chicken and heads back early to the Prometheus, only to get lost.  Even though they can give their position's coordinates inside the ancient structure and are being tracked on a 3-D hologram in the Prometheus, they're still turned around.  In order to make the plot work, one of these morons plays with the critter swimming around in the mysterious black goo running between the mysterious canisters.  By this time you're pretty much rooting for the monsters to win.<br /><br />It turns out at the end that there are many alien ships on that forsaken planet.  Why?  What happened to their crews?  Given what happened to the Prometheus's crew, does it make sense to confront the creators' home planet, other than as a suicide run?<br /><br />What made Aliens work was a believable plot filled with believable people acting in believable ways in a horrific situation.  That's entirely missing here.  Mysteries are left unsolved here, which is all right.  But the sheer density of the people in this film fills the viewer with contempt, not empathy or even vicarious thrills.

Before I start this (in case you don't already know) this is a musical so if you are not into musicals you can stop reading. On the other hand all the music is from 80's hair bands...so that is pretty rad. I will say that this movie is easily the most clich&eacute;d musical I have ever seen. Girl lives in small town, moves to big city, instantly gets robbed but is helped by a boy who immediately gets her a job at the place she wanted and they fall in love...a misunderstanding causes a fight...yada yada yada. To be honest the movie is almost too cheesy to watch, but the music keeps you involved. The entire soundtrack is songs by 80's hair bands. Tom Cruise covering Wanted Dead or Alive is actually pretty sweet. Overall, a movie that really is only watchable because of the music, if you are not a fan of 80's hair bands do not watch this, if you are then you will probably like it as much as I did. I give it a B-
B005MZIF4Q|1.0|What a waste of money, there should be a way to return a digital copy. All it has is some pictures and a couple sentences. No real description or details. The real book is a lot better.
0439023521|4.0|Both my 12 year old and 18 year old loved this book and have read the whole trilogy. The characterization is strong and you can't help root for Catniss even with all her flaws. No doubt that the plot line and setting are captivating and imaginative, but the story is dark, violent and rather depressing. I rank this series in the same category as the Harry Potter and Percy Jackson series in terms of their ability to motivate kids to read.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|I'm not a big movie fan, but my husband is.  Although the effects were spectacular and the story line was unique, the movie dragged.  We didn't watch it to the end, so I'm not sure if it got better.  I'm glad we didn't pay the $10 per person to see it in the theater.
B0037HOWKW|5.0|I love nanoblocks and I really like the grand piano.  The pieces are small but that makes it more fun to put together.  It looks great when finished.  It is not very solid so it can fall apart when you touch it.  Not really a toy for kids more for adults.

B008J5T4Q4|5.0|Like most of the people who bought this album, I too waited impatiently for it to finally arrive and, may I say, it was well worth the wait. \\"The Truth About Love\\" picks up right where \\"Funhouse\\" left off exploring the story of P!nk's life as it unfolds. As usual, most of these songs are deeply personal to her life and this shines through strongly throughout. The first single off of the album, \\"Blow Me (One Last Kiss)\\", brings back what we all loved about P!nk back when she was just a missundaztood girl. The driving beat accompanied with the strong and sometimes raunchy lyrics hooks you in from beginning to end. Apart from this single and the other up-beat tracks, P!nk also shows once again her deep love for slow and emotionally powerful tracks. The highlight of these, \\"Just Give Me A Reason\\" feat. Nate Reuss (lead singer of the band fun.), shows off this girls powerful voice and range which delivering an emotional performance that cannot be ignored. This is an extremely strong album for her overall and I am more than excited to her from her again in the future.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed Book 1 and 2 and especially Book 3.  It brought the story together.  I couldn't put it down.  Can't wait for the movie.  Didn't want the story to end.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Lee Child has made Jack Reacher in to some what of a tour guide or GPS system.<br />Having read all of the Jack Reacher series this was somewhat of a disappointment, more then that maybe.<br />This book was almost all filler and a ho hum ending.<br />Lee please get some rest and start over with the old Jack !

B0037YOMWS|1.0|Pros:<br /><br />HP-30B is very fast. I compare it to HP 12c new platinum(use two 3V coin cell battery) with the same set of data to calculate interest rate, it took the HP 12c new platinum 3~3.5 seconds while it took HP-30B just one second to repeat 100 times! It's about 300 times faster than HP 12c new platinum and more than 1000 times faster than HP 12c.<br /><br />N=360, Pmt=-2123.45, PV=300000, FV=0, set i=15 to make calculator calculation starts from a large number so it takes longer time, then hit `i' key. For HP-30B, I have to program a program that repeats 100 times with the same data to notice the delay.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The key press feeling is not as good as HP 12c new platinum. One of the numeric key is stuck after a very light use within 3 weeks.<br /><br />Called HP and found out the original purchase receipt from **HP authorized dealer** is required to obtain warranty service from HP. The warranty starts on date purchase from **HP authorized dealer**. The Amazon market place reseller cdgameexchg111 is not **HP authorized dealer** and refuse to provide receipt from **HP authorized dealer** when cdgameexchg111 bough the calculator, so there is NO WARRANTY FROM HP.<br /><br />Don't buy from cdgameexchg111.

B007SGM084|5.0|Love the book have read over and over and could not put it down. its raunchy and i love it
0525953728|5.0|What a fantastic book.  It is a must read for anyone who is interested in what really happened the night Bin Laden was taken down.  Special thanks to all the seals and all our soldiers protecting our great country.
0375507256|4.0|Like most people, it took me a couple chapters to get into this book.  Once I did, I greatly enjoyed it and loved all of the individual stories.  However, I think I either missed something, or the book just doesn't wrap everything up as I was hoping it would.  I know there is not supposed to be much of a link between the stories, but it seems like more of 6 great stories with a weak thread holding it all together.  I did like this book a lot and I can't wait to see the movie in a couple weeks.  I hope the Wachowski's can pull everything together and create an excellent ending.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Love this movie! Love the books! The quality was great. The audio was great also. Really enjoyed watching this. Thank you!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Well...this book kept me engaged & interested right up to the last page.  What a ride!  Have you ever known a master-manipulator?  I have, but the character of Amy has manipulation perfected beyond anything you can imagine.  Her husband Nick also learns this skill as the story progresses.  Yes, the ending left me going: \\"what?\\" -  I couldn't believe that it ended when it did.  I kept looking for another page after the last one!  Clever writing, twists & turns, you will never guess the ending.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Just enjoyed listening to all the songs on this album. You wont be disappointed!!! My favorite songs are:<br />This will be my Year and Driveby.
B0053O89XI|5.0|Unlike a lot of comedies that tend to get stale the longer they air, BBT is only getting better. The jokes are funny, the cast works well together, Sheldon keeps up his usual antics, etc. I love this show. And season 6 bluray is definitely worth it!!!! BBT rocks!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Thought I'd give \\"Wool\\" a try since I heard some co-workers talking about it and it was so cheap.  All I can say is wow!!  I was blown away.  I won't give a synopsis since so many other readers already have (and I'm not an author), but I will say the depth of the charcters was amazing, the surroundings are described in vivid detail and the story telling is superb.  I'm now a fan for life!!
B003V9OCS8|5.0|Enjoyed every moment. These ace climbers, bigger than life thrill seekers can't resist the challenge of going beyond their limits. A great story of struggle, wits and overwhelming odds.  In the end you are left thinking \\"How brave and courageous these men really were\\".
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Because of personal circumstances, I found this novel poignant, painful and entirely engrossing.  It is beautifully written with powerful messages. I could not put it down. Harold's journey seemed more incredible than unlikely, but his plight captured my fancy. Indeed, I found myself dreaming about undertaking such a journey. Harold's wife's transformation was instructive. I wish that I had had the benefit of the wisdom in this book years ago. Highly recommend this book.
B0060D133E|4.0|Cute movie. Keeps my three yr old entertained, its a good break from nemo. Although after watching twenty times im sure it will be just as annoying.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|I was waiting for This moive to be released and when fliping through my Amazon Account i noticed it on the instant video on demand.

B00127RAJY|1.0|I ordered this dvd 3 months ago..due to a medical condition I just picked up the dvd today to check it out. Imagine my surprise when the packaging was already slit open.  It was advertised as new.  If it was I'm wondering why it wasn't sealed. I've never had a problem before with amazon, so I hope this doesn't start a trend.[[ASIN:B00127RAJY Jillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred]]
B006LSZECO|3.0|Very unpedictable ending.  Easy read  but far reaching the believable.  Author did her homework and thought it was written well from the character‘s view.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|I haven't read this book in some time, but I do plan on buying it and reading it again.  Why?  I enjoy re-reading great literary classics like this.  The book is full of suspense, action, and drama in a very \\"down to earth, in your face\\" way.  You will have no choice but to assume the role of the main character of the story, no choice but to oblige his every decision and consequence.  And you will do so willingly.  Everything about this book will foce you to reconsider your role upon society and maybe, just maybe, we can all come to grips with the very people who we co-exist with.<br /><br />Highly original, full developed plot and character scheme, easily able to fall into the story and read it for hours without even realizing the day has gone by.  I recommend this to those who cater to novels that demonstrate a immense grasp of society and have the ability to use coarse language in a way that will offend, intrigue, but more importantly it will make you think.  This book is not for children (ages: &lt;17)
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Having previously read all the Lee Child, Jack Reacher  books I must say that I was in no way disappointed with \\"AWanted Man\\"<br />I enjoyed every page and did not stop turning them until the finish. A trully great read. Des Thornton
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the show that sparked the \\"Browncoat\\" movement and the move \\"Serenity\\", plus multiple graphic comic stories and legions of followers.  This is one of the best SciFy tales in the space genre. Gritty, realistic and not set in a sterile or orderly future.  Great series!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great book, true love is forever i just love that they won and could go home. i can‘t wait to read the next book.
B004H0M8EA|4.0|In Collapse Jared Diamond discusses the fall of many ancient and not-so-ancient societies in very direct and understandable ways. He draws parallels and themes that run through the founding, rise, and collapse of so many civilizations. He has personally visited and worked in the areas of each studied civilization. On Easter Island where the previously highly organized culture died out because it destroyed its fragile environment by cutting down all its trees, which never regrew. Dr. Diamond covers the ancient Maya civilization that died out before Columbus \\"discovered\\" America in incredible and shocking detail. The Anasazi, the Norse in Greenland, Iceland, isolated Pacific islands like Pitcairn and Henderson, and other collapsed civilizations are fully discussed. For comparison he discusses successful civilizations too like Japan and the New Guinea highlands and contrasts how their managing of their environments and culture contrasted to the collapsed civilizations.<br /><br />My only complaint is with the Kindle version of the that doesn't show figures very well and has no plates that are referred to in the text.
B007UWBQEU|4.0|This album is as good, if not better, than all the others.  All the songs really are amazing.  Carrie is still an amazing artist!
0307744434|2.0|The fantasy was entertaining for a while but not almost 500 pages worth. I kept wondering if I was missing symbolism or other meaning that I never figured out. Just not my cup of tea.
B0060DYMT6|5.0|I miss THIS Christopher Nolan.  His second best film, after 'Memento'.  Far better than any of the Batman movies, and really, isn't anything better than his terrible remake of 'Insomnia'?
B00000J2PH|5.0|Carole King was most famous for being one half of the songwriting duo (and marriage) of herself and Gerry Goffin who wrote scores of Fifties and Sixties pop hits. It wasn't until 1971 that Carole brought her own musical talents to the fore with TAPESTRY, and this album became the best-selling record in human history until it was eclipsed by Fleetwood Mac's [[ASIN:B000002KGT Rumours]] in 1977.<br /><br />At age eleven this was the first \\"adult\\" record I ever bought (my Dad kidded me and asked if the cat sang on the album), and it was an album which toppled the AM Top Forty in favor of Album-Oriented Rock (AOR). Nearly every song on TAPESTRY is either a bona fide \\"hit\\" or memorable in some way. \\"It's Too Late\\" was the chartsmasher, but \\"I Feel The Earth Move\\" was a close second, and \\"You've Got A Friend\\" became a hit for James Taylor (who played on TAPESTRY).  The rest of the album is filled with melodic numbers that somehow cause the listener to become deeply reflective; in that sense, TAPESTRY is a truly great work, almost the equal of any of the works of the great Masters.<br /><br />Upon reflection some forty years later, I'm struck by the blueness of much of Carole King's composing. This is an album of introspective pieces, an album which helped define the weary calm after the storm of the Kennedy-King-Vietnam Era which it seemed to bookend. I'm always a little sad listening to TAPESTRY (even the added cuts), as if Carole King was bidding farewell to something only she could see but we could all feel.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I found myself unable to put it down. It was so unbelievably addictive. It was such a great book. Loved it!
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|The high quality of the AMC foam gives this a Five Star rating! Kinda seemed demented shoving the screw driver, but it's fake and you just reach in to push a button. Love it!!

0316228532|2.0|Perhaps the reason for J.K. Rowling writing this dark, joyless novel, with truly unlikable characters, was to prove to the world that she could create something that doesn't appeal to children. If so, she succeeded. Trouble is, it doesn't appeal to adults, either. Certainly not to this one. The Harry Potter books started out fun and they grew progressively darker and less amusing. Even so, they were good reads.  Maybe that dark side managed to completely take over this author to the point where all entertainment was, unfortunately, blotted out. I had high hopes for something  immensely  readable here.  I'm fairly certain I won't be anticipating anything of value should there be another book from Rowling.  For sure, didn't get one this time around. Not a book I'd recommend. With all the books on my list that I want to read, I'm rather sorry I wasted any time on this one.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great app. Great designs, great colors, great settings. Recommended it to everyone I know, they loved it. *****

B001G8NW6Y|4.0|The book is extremely too cryptic for normal readers. I had the toughest time understanding all the extremely complicated language in this book. It would be nice for it to have been made for \\"dummies\\", but I still got it. Austrian economics needs to be taught in school, period.

B006Z7Z3R2|5.0|I finally watched this on Netflix this morning and loved it. It's not some big budget scare fest but the certain scenes they did show were scary and I loved that old inn a lot. I think it was the inn and the quirky girl innkeeper that won me over. I'm gonna buy it from Amazon now for a great blu ray price.
B000059TFO|4.0|Mississippi Burning, or MIBURN, was the FBI's code name for breaking the KKK conspiracy following the Goodman-Cheney-Schwerner murders in Neshoba County, at the beginning of Mississippi's \\"Freedom Summer\\" of 1964.  Although it's a well-written production, it glosses over the \\"old boy\\" network of FBI field agents with local law enforcement.  There was no independent Mississippi regional FBI office when the investigation started, fieldwork being divided between New Orleans and Memphis (the latter taking the lead, and notorious for agents with a \\"southern POV.\\") J. Edgar Hoover had to personally intervene to get the ball rolling, as part of his running political battle with the Kennedys as much as a search for justice.<br /><br />The families of the victims also raised objections to the brutal portrayal of the FBI investigation in this film, as counter to the non-violent humanism of the three murdered COFO activists.  And in truth, it was less of the ham-fisted theatrics Hackman shows here than old-fashioned bribery of a local informant for 30K that broke the case.  That said, let me play devil's advocate on one point.<br /><br />The Mississippi White Knights of the KKK operated with such impunity because of their complicity with local law enforcement and the \\"2nd Amendment mentality.\\"  But since the 2nd Amendment applies to all citizens, what would have been the response if Mississippi blacks had also stood on *those* civil rights, to defend themselves against state tyrants like Sheriff Lawrence Rainey?  If NRA-free market purchase to bear arms had led to the stockpiling and then \\"defensive use\\" of them in Mississippi black communities; and Rainey and the White Knights then discovered they, too, could bleed?  This would have been a sure way to instigate Federal intervention in Mississippi without the prolonged procedural delay of investigation and (inconclusive) trial.  Not advocating violence, mind you folks.  Just saying. . . .  ;)
B003K1EYM6|4.0|The build quality isn't up to Apple standards.  The plastic case yields when squeezed.  Otherwise, it does work as advertised, so I'm satisfied.
B0086DBE62|2.0|The two stars are only for the special effects. Except for Julia Roberts, the acting is sub-par. The plot rambles and the script is full of comedic cliches.

B005LAII9Y|4.0|I really enjoyed this Tim Burton/Disney movie.  It is about a boy (Victor) and his dog (Sparky), his parents, and his basic life (schoolmates, neighbors, teacher).  They live in New Holland, where Victor's only interests are Sparky and science.  Mr Burgemeister (the Mayor, aka Dutch) is an old grouch and complains that Sparky sniffed his flowers and peed on his lawn flamingo.  Sparky and the Lady Poodle next door have the dog-hots for each other.  You can figure from the promo what happens in the basic storyline.<br /><br />It is done in the general Tim Burton cartoonish format.  Victor looks very much like Johnny Depp.  One of the classmates reminds you of Peter Lorre with a hunchback.  The science teacher is something like Boris Karloff.  The movie parodies Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and Pet Cemetary.  Although not a comedy, I had two laugh-out-loud moments.  Good entertainment.<br /><br />Not for the very little ones, because of the grief/sorrow piece and some cemetary-related issues that may scare them.  (Really not a  children's movie anyway.)

B005OTGS4E|1.0|In all honesty, this is a B movie.  Plot not bad, acting moderately good, but really!!  Snarling German officer promising imprisonment when you know he does not mean it.

B009329ZF2|3.0|Battleship is a film based upon the board game by the same name.  As expected, the story thus is rather weak.  This movie bombed at the box office, repeating Taylor Kitch's lack of success this year (remember John Carter?)<br /><br />The movie does have a couple of other genre actors, including Liam Neeson who I always find does a fine job.  The other featured star is Alexander Skaarsgard, who has had recent success with HBO's \\"True Blood.\\"<br /><br />To sum up the film, two brothers have joined the Navy.  Aliens invade, cutting off the ships from the outside world, and the few ships must defeat the aliens from destroying the Earth.  Uhh, that's about it.<br /><br />The visual effects are fantastic in this film, with plenty of action and explosions.  The weak story puts the film firmly into the B-movie category however.  If you enjoy movies such as those shown on the SyFy Channel, you will probably get a kick out of this film (worth a rental at least). However this was far from the blockbuster the studio seemed to be hoping for.
B008ASLK8A|3.0|Good Movie, but the video kept freezing up. We managed to finish it but very distracting. Wish I could get a refund.
B0091THRCU|5.0|The Snugg iPhone 5 case is everything it claims to be (secure, snug, perfect fit) and I would highly recommend it. However, the seller (Charon Int / Snugg) has horrible customer service. My order did not arrive within the expected delivery date window and emails to their customer service proved fruitless. My order eventually arrived several days later and, as I said before, the case is great, but I would have liked to received it earlier than 2 weeks after I ordered it.

B008G8SFGO|5.0|These \\"true\\" KISS fans that have a love affair with Ace and Peter need to get over that. That needs to be said, first and foremost, because that seems to be the driving force in them not being able to enjoy anything new KISS puts out.<br /><br />With that said, I see this album as damn near perfect. My only gripe is that I was expecting something a little heavier than the re-used Sonic Boom sound. But I can get past that with the way they used the sound. I think a die-hard KISS fan can see that KISS really went \\"back to the stone age\\" with this album in making it as similar in rhythmic style as their 70's masterpieces. This is definitely a nice step up from Sonic Boom, though. Where Sonic Boom seemed to be generic, lyrically, KISS takes it back to their sex and rock n' roll roots with this one. A great album and I think every KISS fan could, and should, enjoy it.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|fun game. glad i don't work in a grocery store. need more words. and still more words. and even more words.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Very interesting read.  Loved the idea that man created time centuries ago and we've become consumed by it. Wish there had been a bit more wrap up regarding the characters at the end of the book.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Let me start by giving this novel a flat three-star rating. This is the rating it deserves. But why do you see me adding another shiny brass to my evaluation? Well, because Jack Reacher is fun, an incon of the current paleo pop culture, a much needed escapist piece of literature superbly written by an author who knows much about how our minds work. The additional star goes to Lee Child, who may anytime start writing anything else, more powerful, another breakthrough maybe. I truly expect that from Mr. Child, because he can, and because we are a bored society.<br /><br />This time, Jack repeats itself, I believe from his last adventure, but it repeats so much that I was fighting the idea I was actually reading it all over again, everything including the \\"huge dome-shaped structure\\". Here is where my stars stopped at three. Same ole same ole Reacher, older perhaps, losing intensity page after page. I was expecting his broken nose to play a more central role, for example. Or perhaps a few deeper characters, or a gay partner, something to erase the feeling that Reacher is going to die of boredom which, judging from the choice of Cruise as flesh-Jack, is now a sure thing.<br /><br />Kudos for Mr. Child for including a character named Puller, good below-the-waistline punch to the copycat Puller series. And certainly, praise for the almost error-free editing (the Glock 17 vs. 19, didn't you see it?).<br /><br />I'll buy next Reacher's novel, not expecting him to finally die, but perhaps going back to wear those English shoes of the first novels, why not a nice italian jacket borrowed from a mexican drug lord he has just obliterated, and driving a Harley for a change.

B00846REIS|3.0|I personally liked 50 Shades of Grey better....this book doesn't have as much character development and the sex is a little weirder to me. Overall, it's pretty good though. I went ahead and bought the second book, Reflected in You. If you haven't read 50 shades, read this FIRST.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|I bought this for my sons birthday and he loves it. The Legos are everything it stats on the description. Would Definently recommend it.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Prior to reading this book I read a ton of the reviews on here and I was a little concerned that maybe Lee Child had done what some other authors had, started putting out crap to meet a contract. Though this was not his best work, I really enjoyed it and I had no real problem with the repetition that other reviewers complained about. I found this story entertaining and it kept me engaged. I've read books that I've set aside and never bothered to pick back up. Not for a moment did this one risk being part of that group. Like I said, this one wasn't his best, I would give that to Die Trying (imho), but it wasn't his worst either, that would be Persuader (I didn't get the sudden switch to first person, just weird), as a result I would definitely recommend this book to other Reacher fans.
