B007PTJOV0|5.0|If you like super Mario you will like this. Easy and fun way to waste time. My 13 year old enjoys it too.
B004LWZW7Y|3.0|The movie was a little less than I expected.  It was not the actors, it was the story itself.  If you watch it on streaming, you have probably seen as much as you want.
B004GCKRWY|4.0|This is 90 minutes of Ryan Renolds trapped in a box for the entire movie. You should know that going in. Ryan Renolds wakes up trapped in a box. He was a truck driver in Iraq and in hostile territory before his convoy was killed. This is all said in the movie not shown, because again, this is Ryan Renolds trapped in a box. His co stars are a cell phone and a lighter. With the cell phone he calls loved ones and other people that can help. He runs the full gambit of emotions from anger to sadness, love to loss. At least you hear the voices over the phone, which gets some interesting conversations.<br /><br />Buried is really a tour de force of one man's acting talent. He does an admiral job of convincing you that he will die if he doesn't get help.  His acting pulls you in. You are there with him in the cluster phobic confined area. It builds drama and tension to the climax of the movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately that's all that can be said about this movie. It is not everyone's cup of tea. There are no flashbacks. There is no big budget beyond a casket box and a cell phone. If you want to see Ryan Renolds prove his worth as an actor and what will go down as his greatest performance this is it.
0345803485|4.0|Don't read this if you are a man, this was not written for you.  This was written for WOMEN, for our happiness, pleasure, fun, a free very long-distance vacation, reward for long days at work, in long marriages, endless mothering duties...this book if for YOU.  Get it, enjoy, read slowly (if you can) and know you deserve it.
B0073U2FB2|3.0|To sum up this movie... five people visiting Moscow are left stranded when invisible electrical aliens land and start vaporizing everyone. The special effects stand out, but the premise doesn't. It seems far less grand than most alien action movies that pull in the entire planet if not the entire country. There is a very narrow scope that focuses on these five people trying to find a way out of Moscow. If a bigger movie director did this, it would incorporate families seperated, whitehouses and monuments blowing up, presidents and armies fighting the menace and other big budget fluff. Instead this is five people going through empty streets.<br /><br />The aliens are invisible for the most part and vaporize people for the first 60 minutes of the movie, before they can teather people with an electrical lightning like arm that pulls them in. That change seemed jarring. The movie really dragged in the middle which is saying a lot for a 89 minute movie.<br /><br />This could have been done on SyFy Network.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I just downloaded it and now it says it cant update because my Internet wont work. my Internet is working fine needs update. Would love to play if it worked.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|THIS WAS A GREAT READ, VERY ON THE EDGE....ENTERTAINING !! I RECOMMEND THE ENTIRE SERIES. THIS THIRD BOOK OF THE SERIES OF HUNGER GAMES WAS JUST A GOOD IF NOT BETTER THAN IT'S PREDACESSORS.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|pretty fun when your bored all sorts of cool games to play to kill time didn't think I would like it
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it. Couldn't put it down. Have recommended the entire series to everyone. Even read the entire series twice. I am even considering reading it for a third time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great app.  Works without wi-fi so good for traveling.  Fast and easy for when you have time to kill.  Good for young and old alike.
B0041KYK1A|5.0|Le sfumature di amore, la passione e l'intimità raggiungono il loro culmine nell'il classico di \\"idillio puro\\" \\"Le Fabuleux Destin Poulain (alias\\" La Destiny Favolosa di Amélie Poulain\\") ed il suo ora famoso 'cinematografico & poetico' la colonna sonora da Yann Tiersen. L'umore e la sfumatura presiedono la nostra storia epifania-caricato come i guanti di seta. Siamo subito sbalorditi dalla delicatezza del nostro Amélie di eroina (giocato brillantemente da Audrey Tautouand). Diventiamo incantato in questo film attraverso il suo mescolare poetico delle emozioni. La nostra eroina ci disegna nel suo mondo. Sì, potrebbe essere una cameriera timida ma è anche un vero mezzano, che vede delle opportunità di aiutare il nostro Cupido immaginario furtivamente tocco su quei cuori umani dentro il suo piccolo mondo. Amélie lo presenta di noi attraverso la sua persona perfettamente piacevole ed affascinante con una con veduta senza pretese ma sincera di come la felicità - come uno stato di essere - potrebbe essere trovato.<br /><br />La sua calma diventa il nostro nettare empatico: poiché sorseggiamo la ciliegia emotiva versata dalla sua prestazione in un bicchiere di Montmartre. I suoi occhi di zaffiro, il movimento e la forma riempiono la nostra immaginazione con un senso dell'anima femminile stendendo la mano sperimentalmente per l'adempimento romantico: tutto il mentre cercando - come se era un lei-angelo altruista - di aiutare quelli intorno a lei nella loro carriera di dénouement dell'amore nelle loro proprie vite. Amélie fa questo prima che completi il suo proprio movimento di sonata in III di Atto, la Scena 3 mentre \\"La i giochi di Valse\\" nello sfondo. La sua intuizione ci impegna così profondamente: sentiamo un vincolo con lei. Il suo amore ed il suo interesse per gli altri toccano abbastanza. È completamente onorevole e sincera in tutto fa. Non un'oncia di malizia o l'insincerità può essere trovata in lei, e rispettiamo il suo carattere anche mentre presenta la bellezza di tutti i giorni e la grazia a noi, come il suo molto proprio pubblico prigioniero.<br /><br />Il être di doit di femme di Une degno di onore diventa un bel tema dentro la nostra trama: quale nel giro consente che noi attendere sulla decisione dell'Amélie di cercare il contatto con il suo amante futuro, Nino Quincampoix (ha giocato con la mascolinità elusiva da Mathieu Kassovitz). Diretto da Jean-Pierre Jeunet; scritto da Jeunet con Guillaume Laurant; raccontato da André Dussollier; la cinematografia da Bruno Delbonnel; e redigendo da Jeffery Schneid. Tutte le unità hanno aderito a. Pieno all'orlo con le ironie drammatiche e comico a parte. Ha un apice superiore che comincia quando Amélie è ancora bambino e le fini quando diventa una donna matura che trova o ottiene attraverso la sua propria scaltrezza - l'uomo dei suoi sogni. Forse, le interruzioni intime e sensuali - che colpisce ci poiché un pubblico che piace un pezzo davvero elusivo romantico - e (poi) ci incoraggia a riprendere delle memorie belle e li rivive nei nostri pensieri e le nostre azioni. Porta la grand'abilità a rendere che il momento in tempo - come squisito e puro. Questo film cattura quei momenti originari con la passione elusiva e grezza. Vediamo delle coppie che fanno l'amore. Li sentiamo anche esprimendo il loro piacere mentre alle prese con la passione. La vita che sé è stato ora presentato a noi dentro la visione poetica di una donna modesta, Amélie.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|been playing for a month or so. no issues with force close as stated in other reviews I have read. it's been  well-behaved and entertaining
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is the best game in the world! I love it!!! I don't want to show it to my niece!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. Great brain simulator!!! If you like puzzle games you will love Quell. Never gets old. Lots of levels.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|I downloaded this app because there were no others availible for download that looked worth my time, but this one was disappointing. Every time I try to upload a photo, it goes back to the main screen and the screen goes dark.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Really enjoy the feature of this game! Works super! I wish I could figure out how to size the cards so I could put a little space between columns - would make it a lot easier to spot next moves if they weren't tiled against each other. Still,  better than most versions I've played.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I haven't played this yet but people are saying it is a lot of fun but I love all the movies so maybe it will be good
0790729725|5.0|This is a creation of interwoven plots, ingenuity and fantastic casting. Everyone in it is well-worth watching as the plots unfold like emotionally-potent origami. One of my all-time favorites. Highly recommended.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game.  my son loves this game and my four year old girl plays it as well.  great Mario type game.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a lot like super Mario brothers gaming. its a lot of fun and loving it! the best part is its FREE!!
B005LRWRZ8|2.0|I'm in my late twenties and I have been an avid Megadeth fan for well over a decade.  I love most of their albums but every once in a while they come out with something that just doesn't win me over.  Before rating this I went to check what other people had rated their other albums that I really don't care for but it seems Megadeth consistently gets high ratings either due to their powerful fan base or perhaps because people have a different ear for music than I do.  The latter being the case I feel compelled to include with this review my star rankings for all the previous Megadeth albums, if you match up on most points you might well match up on this one as well.  I took these averages from all the songs put together in windows media player since I listen to most all of the CDs on my computer.  Because of this I feel they are the most accurate as they change over time and level out after a CD is purchased.<br /><br />My favorite albums are (in order) Killing is my Business, Countdown to Extinction, Rust in Peace, Peace Sells, So Far So Good So What, The World Needs a Hero, Cryptic Writings, and End Game.<br /><br />This album is more like my least liked albums The System has Failed, and United Abominations.  I've heard that this album has more of a return to a thrash sound and maybe that is the crux of this rating however not being a metal head I cannot say for sure.<br /><br />Megadeth consistently delivers a CD of quality to keep me listening and plugging those CDs in again and again over the years, but this CD together with United Abominations are my least favorite.  This CD has such a homogenous sound, when I was listening to it I had to keep checking to see if I was on the same track or the next.  And the content is not as solid as the type of commentary that Dave usually has on hand.  I feel this was a weak album though not a weak effort.  Hopefully the next one is better.<br /><br />Edited:  Removed the hard number album ratings since it didn't appear to convey exactly what it was in the story I was trying to tell.  Replaced with the lists you see above.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|I always loved piano but never took lessons. I like that I can choose to listen or play the tunes and that they are classical pieces as well as simple ones.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I hate it when apps mess with the kindle interface. Bottom bar is lost and I cant get out of the game!
B004FOA84A|5.0|I loved this game will get more games from Fire Maple for sure.  I loved the strategy. and puzzles works great on my kindle fire.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|Interesting and fun you will be hooked. You go through multiple levels and worlds all with an Irish theme. All very cute.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|it is a ok game it really is fun thoe, I just don't like the controls on it, it is a easy way to mess up
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is an awesome Game!  you cant get better than over 100 games in one. All that and its not .99 its absolutley free.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|fun game if you don't mind waiting. few issues but nothing major. sometimes its hard to click on certain things. I would like a option to store things (I might just be missing how). I have not ran into any thing that requires me to pay actual money, so far I have been able to finish all quests without having to pay real money. the only thing ive seen so far is if you want little extra things and are impatient about the energy.
B004L0NGEC|1.0|Only lets me send photos to email or twitter or back into itself. It doesn't let you share with facebook at all. Nice to be able to see my photos,but wanted to share them as well.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I think this app is cool wish I could still kill pigs though I never update anything and I guess that's why it functions well

0385344325|5.0|This is the second  Lee Child novel I've read and as usual, the author keeps you intrigued from the beginning to the end.  His attention to detail is amazing -I plan to read as many of his books as possible.....I'm hooked on Jack Reacher!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is a lot of fun and even though it is like Mario it is very cute and entertaining

B005K17RU0|5.0|Really like this app.. have it on my phone and my kindle fire.  Very accurate...and has all of the info I need.  Love the &quot;real feel&quot; temp and the wind speed info.
B005HEWK1Q|3.0|I love Star Trek and I've been watching all the films and franchises since I was a kid, but there are a few sticking points that I'll probably never get over.<br /><br />One such peeve relates to the fact that the greatest characters in Star Trek, from Kirk to Picard to Sisko, are warriors, and yet, their Federation doesn't behave like an organization with military force at its disposal. Unethical and unprofessional relationships between superior officers and their subordinates is just asking for trouble and that's why armed forces in the present day tend to legally discourage such problematic relationships.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|has reset 3 times. on one building I have to wait 220 hours until its ready. so frustrating.!!! sent message to support, but haven't heard anything out of them. please fix.!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is the best game I have ever played in my life check this out please and rate it too.
B004IYISSK|5.0|Amy Tan's novels transport you to another place and time. I am reminded of that every time I read one of her beloved books.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|This game could be a lot of fun, but don't offer a free game and then nickel and dime your players with fees for everything from a to z. I would purchase this game for a flat fee rather than having to purchase a little thing here and a little thing there. As this game stands, it is clear that the developers are just greedy.
0439023521|5.0|I read the book after seeing the movie. The book is fabulous, I cannot wait to read the second book.
B000EU1PKA|5.0|Ahh... Pink Bubbles Go Ape... the title alone reveals that Helloween were taking a bit of a different direction with this 1991 release, but believe me, this was a good thing! While I like their earlier, more straightforward metal albums as much as the next metalhead, this album, much like 1993's Chameleon, is a breath of fresh air! No other band sounds as cool or unique as early 90s Helloween.<br /><br />The music on this album is not one-dimensional. It's at times silly, happy, sad, wistful, and majestically epic. No matter what, though, it's always emotional. The Helloween guys have always been great at expressing different emotions. It helps that they're such great musicians. I shouldn't have to remind anyone how pure and pitch-defying Michael Kiske's singing is, and guitarists Michael Weikath and Roland Grapow have fantastic technical ability. More importantly, they really know how to make a guitar sing, whether it be electric or acoustic. Markus Grosskopf and Ingo Schwichtenburg (yes, I had to look up the spelling for that) both do a great job providing complementary bass and rhythm (I especially love Ingo's drum rolls). However, there are also touches of synths here and there that create another atmospheric layer above the standard rock instrumentation.<br /><br />Another thing I LOVE about this album is it's lyrics. They're incredibly relevant to the modern world, and really come from the heart. Take for example \\"Kids of the Century\\": \\"We're stoppin' good waves, we're losin' our trees, the future looks bright ahead. I don't wonder we'll go under in this river of lies... We're the kids of the century--we're lost in our games, no time for the memories we look in the haze...\\" Just in these few lines Kiske comments on the false sense of security that today's young generation (MY generation) feels as we immerse ourselves in electronic gadgetry, unaware that the natural world is being destroyed beyond repair all around us! If this doesn't describe 2012, I don't know what does... The same kind of message is espoused in the epic \\"Mankind.\\" I'll just qoute a few lines from this incredible track which is one of the most meaningful, rich songs Helloween have ever written: \\"Animals dying for our vanity, Our world is a beautiful place to be free... Drinking the blood of the weak, it's so easy, no one hears them cry...\\" The musical textures of this song, along with the great lyrics, present a stunningly true, profound, and heart-wrenching message about humanity. Other songs deal with more personal subjects, like lonliness, and do it most beautifully...<br /><br />As for a few more notes on specific tracks, let me just admit upfront that \\"Heavy Metal Hamsters\\" is quite a zany song lyrically, but who cares! What fun would life be if everyone took themselves all seriously all the time? ;) Anyway, in the middle of the song, there is an absolutlely EXQUISITE harmonized dual guitar section which sweeps me off my feet everytime I hear it. Also, in another quirky song, \\"I'm Doin' Fine, Crazy Man,\\" there's this one section in the middle in which the guitars turn acoustic and create a sublime, heavenly soothing atmosphere that just melts me... Like I said earlier, these guys can express emotions.<br /><br />So anyway, I highly recommend that ANYONE who likes passionate music give Pink Bubbles Go Ape a try. It doesn't matter what music you listen to normally, because this album kind of transcends genre. Chameleon, the other unpopular Helloween album, takes the revolutionary direction of this album even further, with awsome results. Listen for yourself and enjoy something different!w what does...

B007PTJOV0|5.0|At first, I didn't think this game was gonna be all fun. But once I got to play it, I started to really like it. Then I got really good at it. So now I love it. I reccomend this game to anyone and everyone(:
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is a very runway to pass time and have a whole lot of fun doing it! the &quot;create your own town &quot; model makes for a superb time sink in the best way possible! get lost in Oregon trail!
B0063IH60K|3.0|this is so mean to me it wont change my background for some reason and the back of the cards too. its ok though. I am not at all happy with this game.  :-l
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game.  not pumped about the three minute energy wait but still fun. I like the building and how much Action is going on
B0063GORYU|4.0|it is a very good app if you like playing spider solitaire. I have no idea if I speller solitaire right. :-/ oh well.
B004WR125O|1.0|Reading the other reviews for this item, it seems like about 50% of people get it to work OK, and about 50% (like me) can't get it to connect to the network at all.<br /><br />I returned it to Amazon and got the TP-link TL-WN722N. It's cheaper, and worked perfectly right away.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Absolutely awesome book, a must read if you loved Hunger Games. Cannot wait until the third book comes out! 5 STARS
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|awesome game!!!!!!!!lots of fun.<br />great game brings back lots of memories of Oregon trail as a youth.  highly reccomended<br /> for all
B007IQX1G4|1.0|Disappointing. Wasn't enough good character development for me.  I never really cared for the protagonist and what would happen to her.
1594203334|5.0|I am an American living in Andorra (tiny country between France and Spain) raising 3 kids under 5. My oldest 2 go to the \\"ecole maternelle\\" which is one of 3 free public school systems in the country. This book has accurately expressed so many of the observations that I have made while living abroad. She touches on nearly EVERY parenting situation that I have been baffled by and puts into words some of the particularities of American parenting. Critically examining yourself and identifying your own cultural biases is not an easy task. I applaud the author for the in depth research that she completed and her plunge into the philosophical differences of how children are defined in different cultures. Just this weekend my husband and I left our 3 kids with his parents for an anniversary lunch out. We went to a tiny restaurant in Spain and shared the restaurant with 2 other tables. One table had 3 couples, the other table consisted of their 10 kids.  Our lunch lasted nearly 3 hours and I did not witness a single \\"incident\\" with those 10 kids. As we were leaving I complimented the parents on what well behaved children they had and how lucky they are. I corrected myself by then saying that I know it has nothing to do with luck. It is hard work. This author explains in detail the work required to have a happy family. And I specifically say family, because that is what the emphasis is on. The mom, the dad, the wife, the husband, the woman, the man, and the children. All of these parts have to be in balance for a happy family. Thank you, to the author for thoroughly, accurately, and concisely sharing her journey. I learned a lot from her writings and laughed plenty along the way.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The concept is fun.  The UI is wonderfully smooth.  The art is beautiful.  All Android apps should aspire to achieve Quell's standards.
B0000931QA|5.0|Mindcrime is the turning point in their career and it's a masterpiece.  Concept, lyrics, music skills, song structures and everything is great. It's a rock opera, its story follows a man who becomes disillusioned with the society of the time and reluctantly becomes involved with a revolutionary group as an assassin of political leaders. Revolution Calling, Speak, Needle Lies and Operation: Mindcrime are my favorite tracks. Mindcrime is a classic and arguably their best album to date.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|not bad but cant get neighbors ....very frustrating.<br />..also energy takes a long time to accumulate..money pit .. could be a great game tho..I may keep playing
B000002IV8|4.0|I Hear Black is one of the most underrated albums in metal. They mixed grunge, alternative rock and metal. It isn't their best but it's mostly solid and very underrated. Anthrax had a lot of grunge and alternative influences on Sound of White Noise, Metallica went a mainstream direction on The Black Album but for no apparent reason Overkill get's more hate. World of Hurt is one of their best songs ever.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really do like toplay this game.  If I'm not in th emood to read or do not have access to a Wi-Fi signal, I can play this and not get bored.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|it wont load on kindle fire!I keep on trying but it doesn't load!come on. .c...........,,....,......,........................ popcap please fix that.when you do thanks!ok.I love this game I beg you to fix it!and its awesome.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I found this omnibus by accident and was a little wary of purchasing the collection without knowing if I would like the story or writing, but based on the reviews I decided to be a crazy risk-taker and go for it. And the gamble paid off! I read a lot of self-published works on the Kindle and consider finding unknown authors to be part of the fun of eBooks. That said, it is very common to come across books that are in serious need of an editor and a spell-check. Not so this book! This book reads as smoothly as one published by one of the New York publishing giants (and I'm frankly surprised they haven't gobbled up these stories). The flow was good, the characters were interesting and well written, and I didn't notice any obvious spelling or grammar errors. I will definitely be checking out other works from this author, and can't wait to see what happens to this world in future works.
6302181569|2.0|I tried to watch this and couldn't. Anne's legs kept distracting me from the mind deadening godawful dialog---and her legs weren't even that good. Despite the scenery, effects and main idea, it's still not worth watching as a film. Want a great SF film? Watch Fifth Element or Aliens
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The main character, Christian Grey, is a really different kind of lead character.  He is possessive, extremely rich, charming, good looking, and deviant in his sexual desires.  He is sexually lewd (a dominant) and demands a contract being signed by his (submissive) that curbs her ability to discuss anything that may transpire.  Christian has a playroom where he has many playtoys, all new to my limited knowledge.  I found his sexuality extremely disgusting, but at the same time intriguing.  Antastasia, being new at the whole sexual encounter, does not seem to be as naive, as one would think.  Anastasia did jump right into the weirdness of Christian's sexuality.  I think she is a good submisive, although at the same time she cannot be completely controlled.  The ending of this book left a good lead-in to reading the second part.  I did not think that I would be interested in reading further, but I found myself ordering the next sequel.  The sexuality is a bit much, but if you breeze through the wordy sexual descriptions, there is a story and it is quite interesting. It is amazing to read how much Christian and Anastasia change through their story.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|For those who enjoyed \\"The Tipping Point,\\" or \\"Blink\\" - this is another of Gladwell's masterpieces. The common conception is that success is based upon intelligence: Orientals are more intelligent, therefore they excel in academics; the poor, living in slums, are not bright, therefore they achieve little or no success. Gladwell demonstrates with many examples that this notion is wrong. Even Bill Gates admits that he was \\"extraordinarily lucky\\" to get access to a time-share computer system during high school. Even Mozart had unique advantages as a child that contributed to his later success. Gladwell says. We are all products of our time and our circumstances. His 10,000 hour rule reminds us that success does not come easy, even if you are endowed with the highest IQ in the world. Persistent hard work over a long period of time along with cultural, social and geographical factors play a huge role in determining who gets to reach the pinnacle of achievement. The book truly defines outliers in almost every field and challenges well known assumptions about success, intelligence and the factors that contribute to achieving greatness. Definitely a recommended read!
B003L77G38|5.0|I just Love this show! There has never been nor will there ever be another show as excellent as this show! It's not just another Sci-fi show. It's sci-fi mixed with a great drama!
B004IE9REE|1.0|The only way to get the newer, updated edition of this book is to buy the paperbook edition.<br /><br />The Kindle edition is actually taken from the older, outdated hardback edition; which is to say it does not contain the numerous updates, new reviews(~450) and new Top 10 lists.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|even though its like super Mario brothers. this game is still pretty fun. the goal is simple just got to stay alive and get all the coins you can
B007MJSQSK|5.0|All I have to say is that I went to see this movie when it first came out in theatres with one of my bestest friends and we LOVED this movie. I own it on DVD and it is SOOO recommended to own! :) <33
B0075PYG1M|5.0|Nothing's better than this...... When you start listening you can't stop....first I heard of him when the radio station here started playin the song ft. Musiq .... Whoa then I the one w/ Eryka Badu, my girl, tell you what put it in sit back and let the music take you on a journey... Awesome!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I like this game because it's just nice to have a distraction. I wish though that it was more like the old Oregon Trail.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mocking Jay is a great book. It is about how Katniss and Peeta (the star crossed lovers from district 12) are involved in the rebellion. We learn the true side of everything, even Plutarch Heavensbee, the head gamemaker. Katniss Everdeen never knows what is next for her.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is awesome I downloaded it because I heard it was good. I started playing and couldn't stop. This game is kinda like frounteirville off facebook.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My nephews love this game. I would advise anyone wanting to keep their kids quiet and busy to get this app.
B0055SWM08|5.0|So refreshing to play an app with no ads.  This is a really fun puzzle game with a neat art style.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|This is a pretty cool app on the surface. It has great graphics and very detailed weather info. Unfortunately it has so many flaws that it is rendered unusable.<br /><br />The biggest flaw is that the times of day are all wrong. It is supposed to show weather info for every third hour starting at 2am but instead it populates the data seemingly at random so the data shown for 2am could really be for 11am or 2pm or 8pm.<br /><br />Another major flaw is the purely designed home screen widgets. The widgets are way to large and contain more information than you could possibly need from a widget. The excess of information isn't a problem in itself but because there's so much info the text is necessarily minuscule. This makes it nearly impossible to check the weather quickly, which is the entire point of using widgets in the first place.<br /><br />The settings are also a problem as the app appears to ignore whatever the user sets. For example, you can set it to use either 12- or 24-hr time formats but regardless of the user's setting it shows the clock in 12-hr format and the weather details in 24-hr format.<br /><br />The app allows you to add multiple locations but only allows you to view the weather for the first location unless you add a home screen widget for each additional location. Plus it doesn't have the ability to check weather by the phone's current location.<br /><br />And finally there is no option to refresh weather data so if you set it to refresh once a day you can never get an update in the middle of the day. You also can't turn off the automatic refresh so it's always sucking life out of your battery.<br /><br />These are just the app's biggest flaws. There are also many other smaller ones not worth mentioning. Bottom line: don't waste your money on this. There are numerous other apps available that are much better, most of which are free.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|eerily similar to a game about a pair of plumber brothers and a princess ... love it anyway! Pep needs a partner in the game though - brother, side kick, someone

B00000IQW5|5.0|I strongly agree with other reviewers that the biggest problem with this film was it wasn't what people expected from Spielberg, despite the evidence of his trademark craftsmanship...  The 4 main characters were well drawn and realized; each of them with the quirkiness of real people.  The chemistry between Dreyfuss and Hunter was palpable and credible, as was the different feel of the budding relationship between Hunter and Johnson.  Audrey Hepburn's performance embodied the grace and wit I associate with her, and yet, she was as I hope an angel would be.  Personally, I loved how, in the climatic scene, as Hunter came closer to death, she was better able to interact with Dreyfuss's spirit; their final contact remains on the the most affecting scenes I've ever seen.  I most appreciated that, in the film, life and afterlife were wonderful and fulfilling, but very different.  One could view Pete's experience as both his hell and his redemption.  This is a lovely, wise film for people who are open to it.
B000024KRO|5.0|perfect
B004A8ZX28|3.0|It is a mystery, with some nice action scenes.<br /><br />The story starts off with this scientist coming to a convention. Suddenly, things start to go wrong, and he discovers that he may not be who he thought he was. People start to chase him, and people start to die. By which stage, I was starting to get into the movie. But then the story just started to go south. Your left wondering at the end whether the hero actions make sense. Without trying to give away the story, if I was him, and I learnt what he learnt I doubt I would act the way he did at the end.<br /><br />The acting was good. They played their characters well. I found them interesting.<br /><br />The filming was good, the action scenes were quite exciting.<br /><br />I would not see it again as I know the story, and I doubt I would recommend it, for anything else then a TV movie.

0440539811|4.0|It's a truism that a ground-breaking work is often not as well known as its successors.  Edgar Allen Poe's prototypical C. Auguste Dupin, a detective before the word was even coined, is not nearly as well-known as Arthur Conan Doyle's imitative Sherlock Holmes.  Hildegard Von Bingen, the mother of opera and perhaps the greatest influence on the development of classical music, is not a household name like her successors Richard Wagner and Johann Sebastian Bach.<br /><br />In the same way The Illuminatus! Trilogy by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson quoted [[ASIN:1556343205 Principia Discordia]] extensively--and people still thought the original work was non-existent.<br /><br />The trilogy starts with a clue to its own mystery: it begins with the obscure island Fernando Poo, which is itself an obscure Discordian joke.  Fernando is from Ferdinand the bull, and \\"poo\\" is, well....<br /><br />Joseph Malik, radical magazine editor, stumbles on reports of a secret society that may be--and then Malik's office explodes and he disappears.  Saul Goodman, the type of streetwise detective who stepped into the gumshoes worn by the hard-boiled detectives of the 1930s and 1940s, takes the case.<br /><br />And it's quite a case, as the book travels through time and space and even thought.  Like Principia, the book can be funny, serious, funnily serious, and seriously funny.  Virtually every conspiracy you've ever heard of is in there somewhere--even if they weren't created until after the book was written.  This was years before [[ASIN:0307474275 The Da Vinci Code]], so it is ironically and perhaps prophetically a take-off of a genre that hadn't fully begun.  Also ironic is that some fans take the Illuminati books by Shea and Wilson, who when editors for Playboy made up letters to themselves, completely seriously.<br /><br />Important parts of the trilogy take place in Mad Dog, Texas (read \\"mad dog\\" backwards).  The books are copyright 1975, the same year the pornographic movie [[ASIN:B00004T8VD Deep Throat]] was declared legally obscene in Texas.  But had every word of this book been filmed, by comparion Deep Throat would look OK for Sunday School.  Discordianism at its most fundamental level challenges cultural norms, and those definitely including sexuality.<br /><br />The trilogy even briefly touches the Alice of Wonderland/Dorothy of Oz/Wendy of Neverland youth-adult sexual connection fully explored, exploited, and exploded in Alan Moore and Melinda Gebbie's porno-graphic novel [[ASIN:1603090444 Lost Girls]].  (Wendy was sexually precocious in J. M. Barrie's original Peter Pan and Wendy, and was based on the real-life prostitute Minnie Rae who played mother and wife to James, although Moore said he didn't know the real-life connection until after he wrote the book).  Like most \\"true\\" Discordian works (including [[ASIN:1937536181 Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia: The Tales of Shamlicht]] which tells details of the real-life Wendy), the trilogy feels its way into areas of sexuality that touch and toy with the \\"immoral\\" and even the illegal.  Just one brief exchange from the second book, The Golden Apple: \\"I wanted sex with my father, when I was two years old.  When did you have that thing about the Saint Bernard?/When I was eleven or twelve, I think.  Just before my first period\\" (p. 376).<br /><br />Along the twisted way you'll meet Hagbard Celine, the Captain Nemo-like owner/creator but not leader of a yellow submarine, and the prank-pulling the Midget (Markoff Chaney).  Both of them were inspired by the same real-life kid, \\"The Gamemaster of Florin,\\" who found Fernando Poo on an old map and contributed to Principia Discordia.  And if you aren't aware of the connections between Discordians and The Beatles (The Golden Apple/Apple Records, the Yellow Submarine associated with a pyramid/the Yellow Submarine associated with a pyramid)....And then there's John Dillinger, who may have died for you, and....<br /><br />Before you open the book, open your mind and be prepared to be unprepared.our mind and be prepared to be unprepared.

B0050DZ8J0|1.0|i'm completely convinced that this app uses your contacts to recommend connections based on the emails in your contacts WITHOUT requiring you to upload them. basically it snoops through every contact you have without asking you.  it would be understandable if they asked you to upload them but it does it behind the scenes.  personal contacts that are not related to the work email I registered with, who I have never emailed from my work email and who don't have me work email are being recommended to me.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I purchased this book because Amazon included it in one of their weekly e-mails and saw that it received such rave reviews. I read the first book in 2 days, immediately bought the second, read that in about 3, and then bought the third. I absolutely fell in love with the characters. My heart breaks for what Christian has gone through and I get a sense of pride in how well Anastasia handles him, and was captivated by how they evolved together. I HIGHLY recommend reading this series, you will NOT regret it!

So many characters and so much intertwine of the plot and twists in it. Almost needed a score card to keep track of everything. Ending left some holes that I can see being used in a future book. I would recommend the book.

B007LB1O3I|1.0|This album will go down, in the future, as being rubbish. The normal fuss, will be made at release, as always, but essentially this album lacks soul, depth, personality. Its a bunch of over extended advert jingles, at best. Sorry, it truly is a pile of crap, musically speaking.
159102594X|1.0|After reading all three novels I am sorely disappointed.  The only noteworthy mentions I have to make are:<br />1. \\"Grimace\\" or \\"grimaced\\" is repeated a zillion times in all three novels.<br />2. Plot is inexistent, zero, nada, a futile black-hole with a gravitation so powerful that sucks in meaningless words at an astonishing rate spewing them towards the reader without mercy.<br />3. \\"Sucking ones gums\\" is ok to be done ten times in a novel; not a hundred or more times; decrepitude can only go so far.<br />4. Characters are like a medium rare steak that the waiter dropped on the floor before serving it to the table; muddy to the reader, muddy to themselves and muddy to the surrounding characters.<br />5. Approximately a quarter of the entirety of all three novels deals with torture; either inflicted or received; either presently or in the past; either physical or psychological.<br />6. There is no texture. The reason any work of literature is created is to evoke strong emotions; negative or positive, hate, sorrow, love, happiness.. anything that would make a reader develop goose-bumps.<br />7. Did I mentioned it lacks goose-bumps?<br />8. The writer has another 200 k words to write before he can come close to GRRM, Terry Goodkind, Brandon Sanderson or the late Robert Jordan. (I have read all their respective published novels)
1904905803|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2Z5PLBNRLXFLO]]<br /><br />COMMON SENSE GUIDANCE ON UNTANGLING THE TAX SCHEDULE IN COMMERCIAL SALES TRANSACTIONS - WITH ACCOMPANYING DISC<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />If you're a tax lawyer, or accountant, or advising in some capacity in matters involving the sale of a company and concerned with negotiating the tax schedule, this book from Spiramus, the specialist business publisher, should be added to your library, or preferably your desk drawer.<br /><br />From what we can gather having perused this book (and also not being tax specialists) the matter of the tax schedule can be confusing to the point of being impenetrable.  So a guide to the processes and procedures as provided by expert author Eile Gibson is certainly timely and should prove invaluable, especially in the wake of the Finance Act 2011.<br /><br />As the publishers point out, new legislation -- the Finance Act 2011 in particular -- has generated changes, all of which need to be reflected in the tax schedule, the purpose of which is to determine where responsibilities and risks will occur once the sale/purchase transaction is completed.<br /><br />The book explains the key provisions of the tax schedule and their underlying rationale, together with long-form and short-form warranties and tax indemnities.  These are also included on a disc, which you can download and adapt for your own requirements.<br /><br />The transactional process is explained in detail followed by chapters on such areas due diligence... the sale and purchase of a company and of a business... share schemes... venture capital schemes... and much more, including of course, the tax schedule.<br /><br />As a research source, the book certainly excels, containing as it does fourteen appendices which include such aids as the long-form and short-form tax schedules, time limits, penalties and errors and key checklists and much more besides. There are tables of authorities and statutes and an extensive detailed glossary designed to uncomplicate a number of otherwise complicated concepts and terms.<br /><br />Written by an acknowledged expert in this complex field, this is an invaluable and authoritative aid to seeing you through the almost inevitable disagreements and disputes that feature in complex negotiations inherent in the sale of companies.  For tax lawyers, tax accountants and advisors, corporate lawyers and company finance directors, the acquisition of this book is a must.re tables of authorities and statutes and an extensive detailed glossary designed to uncomplicate a number of otherwise complicated concepts and terms.<br /><br />Written by an acknowledged expert in this complex field, this is an invaluable and authoritative aid to seeing you through the almost inevitable disagreements and disputes that feature in complex negotiations inherent in the sale of companies.

I recommend this series to anyone who likes funny,  brutal, and captivating books.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I was hesitant to buy the books at first, but I was really bored so I figured why not. I was surprised that I could not put it down despite the mediocre writing and sappy love story, but then I realized why. The author managed to come up with characters that had qualities that the target population was looking for. Anastasia Steele had practically no personality and was a shell that any young woman could relate to. Low self esteem, family issues, it's all there. Christian Grey was breathtakingly handsome, rich, and had one fatal flaw: He loved Anastasia too much. He was protective, a great lover, but still remained mysterious enough through all of it. So the writing was not great, but it was the characters that were spot on. I also have to say that the author went way overboard when it came to the sex. I doubt that anyone with that sort of sexual appetite could manage to walk or lead a normal life.
B004LROUW2|4.0|\\"We were asked to make a vow, and we did.  We were forced to go through hard times, and we made it.  We were able to accomplish the goal that we came here to accomplish.\\"<br /><br />This quote from Haruki Murakami's \\"1Q84' shows a side of this book that I was a little surprised to find.  While this book really creates some of the best magical realism I've read in a while it is also, very simply, a love story.  It took me much longer than I expected to finish this book, and at over 900 pages this is a long book which requires a good deal of dedication to make it through.<br /><br />The novel \\"1Q84' is a more sophisticated \\"Inception\\" where the protagonists are struggling to understand just what world they have fallen into this time.  The world is signaled by the moon.  If there is one moon, you are in 1984.  If there are two moons, you are in 1Q84 or \\"the cat town\\".  Fairly simple at the surface, but things get more complicated as the protagonists Tengo and Aomame reveal more of their stories and the novella Air Chrysalis  enters the scene along with the Sakigake cult whose secrets it unleashes.  This book is, as I've said, mystical realism with the cult being controlled by the not-good but not-bad Little People , crime novel with Aomame's secret profession, and mystery.  But at it's heart, this is a love story.  Tengo and Aomame have been longing for each other since elementary school and after 20 years are getting close to their reunion.<br /><br />There are a lot of things Murakami does well (or the translator does well.  I'm never sure who I should really be praising when I read a translated work as I cannot read the original text and compare).  The descriptions and details are flawless.  Your imagination will not have to fill in the blanks.  This book could be used as textbook for the \\"show don't tell\\" writing mantra.  The magical realism elements are also perfectly blended.  While many of these elements are bizarre and hard to imagine, Murakami makes you believe.  I couldn't tell you when I just pushed reality aside and started to believe, but it happened.  The pacing of the novel is also done well, there are sections that seem a little too repetitive, but overall each section links to the ones before and after it.  My only issue with the novel was the ending.  The whole novel seemed to be focused more on the magical elements and then ends entirely focused on Tengo and Aomame's reunion.  This does add to the overall atmosphere of the novel...but as a reader I just wanted a little more closure (don't we all though...)  I would also like to state that there is a lot of sexual content in this book, some of which is relevant to the plot and some of which is not quite so crucial.  If you're someone who is opposed to this kind of content, you've been warned.<br /><br />This book does seem to go along with a popular theme we've seen in media recently.  It fits in perfectly with movies like \\"Two Earths\\" and \\"Melancholia\\" and if you're a fan of either one of these movies you will enjoy this book.  However, if neither of these movies appealed to you and you weren't able to sit through the full two hours, don't invest your time starting this one.  It'll take you far longer than two hours to finish this book and it is in the same vein as both of these.  Obviously it's not exactly the same and if you really feel like giving this book a try, by all means go for it.  I would be lying if I said this was going on my favorite book list.  It's a little long, a little slow in parts, and the ending left me just a little unsatisfied.  That being said it is worth the time to read it once.  It gives you a lot to think about, a new world(s) to immerse yourself in, and characters who just seem real.e.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I finished all three books in the Fifty Shades Trilogy in less than a week.  My overall rating : I really enjoyed the books.  I have to agree with some other reviewers and say that the writing really isn't very good.  There were parts where the same scenes were being described the same ways over and over and it was very frustrating.  At some point in book two, I really wanted to stop reading but glad that I didn't.<br />The one positive about these books : I felt the emotions that Anastasia was having.  When she left Christian, I felt it in the pit of my stomach and even cried.  When she lied to Christian about leaving him in the third book, I felt that, too.<br />The sex was a bit over the top and got to be too much for me so most times, I just skimmed through.  I'm not a prude at all but that's ALL they do!!<br />Still, a good story and I really loved the connection between Ana & Christian.  I'm sad now that the books are done and I'm left wanting more.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book is written sweetly, gently and with just about as much tenderness as anyone can write about someone they love and appreciate.

When I don't try to move or zoom the map, it doesn't crash.<br /><br />But the crashes are very annoying, often requiring me to hold the power button in for 20 seconds to force a shutdown to get the Kindle to respond.<br /><br />If the developers would fix this problem I would give this app 5 stars.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is really fun to play. And so many different games to play if you get bored. Awesome game!
B002W5UVSM|5.0|This was the first book I got and read on the Kindle. I received my Kindle for Christmas, and shortly afterwards noticed in the \\"special offers\\" ads, kindle books for $1, which included this book. I have heard from several college buddies and teachers that I would like the dark humor and character study aspect of it. I really enjoyed this book. It's funny and very interesting. It grabbed my attention from the very first chapter. Normally I read non-fiction because it takes too long for the story to grab hold of me. This was not the case with \\"A Confederacy of Dunces.\\" The descriptive language, the characters, the twists were all well crafted and well written. I loved the interplay between the seemingly non-connected character, and how they all got tangled up in the wake of Ignatius J. Reilly self absorbed actions.<br /><br />This is a very funny book, and I am very glad I read it. I would recommend to fans of Vonnegut, because of the similar dark humor and social commentary.

B0044XV3R8|5.0|I know a lot of people don't like to do reviews, but i need to on this one.  The quality of the product is impecible, and the method under which it was delivered is superior to most.  There were no dings/dents in it and it was handled great by the postal service.  That i was able to purchase it using Paypal was even better.<br /><br />No problems with the movie (which is great by the way), so i'm happy all the way around.

0897502027|5.0|This book is not just a primer on martial arts; it is an enlightening journey through the philosophical aspects of Bruce Lee's system of fighting. I purchased it based upon the recommendation of my friend and Sifu for its value in basic fighting principles. Upon reading (and re-reading) it I was equally as fascinated by the scientific approach to fighting as with Lee's comforting philosophical principals.

B0030A0ZD4|4.0|Can't believe I haven't seen this until now.  Yes, I do think this is mainly for MJ fans, others would probably find it silly.  To me, it shows Michael at one of his best times, the BAD era.  There is a certain sweetness that I don't think is faked.  For those who don't know, there are video (sorry, short films) clips in the beginning with a very short retrospective look.  It is just a sweet, simple reminder of Michael in a much better time in his life.  Enjoy!

B007Q476KU|1.0|like others have said, the movie had some redeeming qualities, but was just so terribly slow.  its predictable plot was, to be blunt, boring.  wife and I couldn't make ourselves finish the dvd.
B005EWDA9M|5.0|I started this book with no particular set mind. As soon as i started, i could not put it down. The story is really grasping, and from one chapter to another you wonder what will happen to those two characters. The fist book was very interesting, though i must say the second book had a plot that you could easily guess. At time, some situation were difficult to understand cause no much explanation.<br />Overall, its really enjoyable to read and would recommend!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|there is a game for EVERYONE. it has over a hundred games obviously.  it is for all ages from 2 to 100.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|I think this app is really fun! I recommend it to anyone who loves art. One thing I dislike is how you cannot pick the size of your drawing tool. :-)
B0054U53WG|3.0|This book will give you a decent understanding of what google is-- how it makes money, what it's products are, how it was founded etc... I liked this element of the book and I certainly have a better understanding of google's timeline now. Personally I would have preferred the author to try and go into more details about the psychology of the Google founders-- Serge Brin and Larry Page-- and also the CEO-- Eric Schmidt. My impression is that the author was not able to spend enough time with these people to truly understand how they think. Instead the author tries more generally to explore the culture of Google.<br /><br />There is an interesting section in this book about Google's expansion in China and Google's various problems with copyright laws. These sections gave me a better understanding of the problems currently facing technology firms. In general, however, I don't think there's anything in this book that can't be found through a Google search.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is wonderful for my kids it gives them alittle energy after the games so they can play act like there doing agame where they build stuff and all
B007P3TMW2|5.0|I found this movie incredible moving. The film is about a young boy struggling with the death of his father. In some places the director makes the decision to move away from the cold-hearted reality of city life (we see the young boy openly talking to strangers for example). Personally, I don't mind this. The suspension of pure reality helps to create a story line that is better at stirring the emotions. This film probably isn't for everyone, but if you're looking for a film to create hope this might be for you.
B007MG360G|5.0|its so fun I. loved it. one of the most fun apps ever.  its kinds a puzzle game so if u don't like puzzles u really wont find fun out of it its not hard though but still get it
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|Let me preface this by saying I am a 22 year old female, and I love this show! Although I tend to have more mannish tastes. This is a show that really makes you think while watching it, so maybe that's why there was some bad reviews. This show is original, which is this day and age is hard to find. I have not read the books so I cannot comment as to how true it stays to the books, but just judging from the show alone, it's amazing. It can be hard to keep track sometimes of the storyline so I've watched the season more than once to find the things I missed but I loved seeing it again and again. It's unpredictable which is great, and the first season had some big stars (Jason Momoa, Sean Bean, Mark Addy) but mostly it was cast with a bunch of no ones so instead of focusing on where you've seen them before you really focus on the character they are playing. It's a pretty dark show so I guess if you have a problem with death then this is not for you. Also if sex makes you uncomfortable this is definitely not for you. This is HBO though, so I don't know how anyone would think that wouldn't be in it. I can't give this show a review that would do it justice but it's definitely a must see.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is almost like the Oregon trail. its pretty good and I like it a lot. great to play when you got a bit of time on ur hands
B006GM8NXM|5.0|My husband and I started watching this when someone from Blockbuster recommended it and we've been hooked since! It's HBO so that makes it all the better. It has a strong female lead, which Anna Paquin nailed, and some great eye candy (Alexander Skarsgard, Stephen Moyer, and Joe Manganiello). Every season leaves you hanging, but it makes waiting for the next season so much more intense. They are 5 seasons in and still going strong. It has conflict, love stories, violence, and in true HBO fashion, lots of sex. So if that makes you uncomfortable this show is not for you. If you like Twilight, then this show is definitely not for you. This has hardcore vampires, shape shifters, and werewolves. If you have good tastes, you'll love this!

B0073PZIYI|1.0|Wish there was a rating less than 1.  Terrible acting, should have been intriguing and exciting considering the great plot concept, but they managed to make it boring.  Didn't like Timberlake's music, like his \\"acting\\" even less.  Nobody in the whole thing is the least bit attractive, and no one elicits any sympathy or empathy or good will.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|What WAS this? Was she kidding? Please tell me this is a social experiment.<br /><br />This was horrible. A couple hours of my life I'll never get back. I cannot understand the positive reviews or the reviews that say this was hot. This alternated from insulting to boring. It's antiBDSM, misogynistic, ageist and, well, pathetic. Why anyone over the age of 15 would bother, I don't know. There are no positive role models for women over, say, 13 years old. Christian isn't a dom. Sorry ladies but this isn't BDSM. Not even close. People who write BDSM and don't understand it? Just do harm to the lifestyle. And the heroine? The book would be better off if she just went away... preferable forever.<br /><br />As for the other BDSM characters, was there a positive one in the book? Um no. Gee thanks for nothing there author.<br /><br />Not only that, the author needs to get over her Apple fetish and keep it out her writing. Us linux people find it sad and pathetic.<br /><br />And again, don't write about cultures and areas you can't be bothered to research.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|my sister has this game on her ipod and I was solo jelous I couldn't get it on my kindle. on hers its called super jump world. I kept searching that name and got nothing. I finally found it and I love it!!!!!!!
0345803485|1.0|This is supposed to be Twilight fanfiction right? IT SHOWS. Save your money. This isn't BDSM. Not even close. It is, in fact, insulting to well written BDSM fiction Skip this trash and go straight to Annabel Joseph, Cherise Sinclair or Maya Banks.<br /><br />The heroine is pathetic and judgemental. The 'hero' isn't much of one and has monumental mommy issues that take away more than make the book interesting. The author has a serious hard on for Apple merchandise and didn't do hardly any research into her subject matter including but not limited to college lifestyle in America, Seattle and its surrounding area, BDSM and, oh, how Americans talk.<br /><br />Don't even BOTHER with the sequels.

B005NKGEP2|1.0|What a waste of time - I really tried to get into this book, but I just couldn't.  The author keeps jumping around from past to present, and back again.  I couldn't tell if I was coming or going. The plot is slow in coming -but I wouldn't know because I couldn't get that far.  A total waste of $12.99.
B001NI24OI|3.0|This is a movie about young people playing a sport under high expectations. The primary focus of the movie is the on-field performance, so it's an action movie with a dramatic twist. Artistically, the highest achievement of the movie was the instrumental soundtrack by the Texas band Explosions in the Sky (even if it's not original music from them; it was recycled from existing albums).<br /><br />This movie could have been so much more.<br /><br />(1) Wasted acresses: In the TV show, we find out that Connie Britton (who plays the coach's wife in both the TV show and this movie) is an exceptionally talented actress, but we only get a peek at her talent in the movie during the scene where she talks about escaping to Alaska. Similarly, Amber Heard (who was in this movie for about 1 minute as the topless girl on the couch) is now a leading female actress with serious talent.<br /><br />(2) Not enough focus on high school social life: We play high school sports in large part for the girls. But other than the party scene near the beginning, we learn nothing about the challenges of high school relationships; the girlfriends have almost no impact on these guys' lives. The TV show turns the girlfriends, played by accomplished actresses Minka Kelly and Adrianne Palicki, into main characters and thoughtfully explores their impact on the game of football.<br /><br />There are other things missing, but I understand that you can only cover so much ground in 2-hours. If the movie had traded some action scenes for drama scenes involving actresses, it would have been a much better film, instead of just an action movie.
0439023513|1.0|This book was horrible. What a let down. Had this been the first book in a series, no one would read it. The most fatal of all her errors: telling not showing.
B000002J27|5.0|This record is really good.  I admit that I like Genesis with Peter, Phil and Ray.  Each had their own style and that's not saying that any of it was bad.  Peter was always innovative (don't care for his solo stuff, but with Genesis it was always something different) Phil was Phil.  He had his inventive moments but he became repetitive in his style.  Again, not exactly a bad thing.  It's just that you knew it was Phil before he ever started singing.  Ray has (or had) promise.  Calling all stations was a good record, not great.  Unfortunately, the record bombed.  I would have liked to have seen where he would have taken Genesis.  But this record is clearly the Alpha and the Omega of Genesis.  It is both the end of an era and the beginning of a new era.  And its excellent.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" by Suzanne Collins is a science fiction novel based in the country of Panem, a post-apocalyptic America, which illustrates the internal and external struggles of the main character, Katniss Everdeen.  The plot surrounds The Hunger Games, in which in an effort  to show power, the Capitol forces citizens from twelve surrounding districts to send one boy and one girl, tributes as they are called,  to fight to their death for punishment of a rebellion that happened long ago.  Suzanne Collins utilizes numerous techniques throughout the novel, including an inspiring ability to engage the reader from one chapter to the next, the countless detail that does not seem relevant until the plot twists, and an elegant script that encompasses love, death, and everything in between.<br /> Throughout the book, the author concludes chapters in a way that is so captivating that it makes it very difficult to put the book down.  Collins writes in an almost suspenseful way that leads to many questions and crucial ideas.  The first chapter ends with the reaping where the female tribute's name is pulled; \\"It's Primrose Everdeen\\" (p. 20).  It is difficult not to feel sorry for this twelve year old girl that will inevitably be killed if she is forced to participate. The difficulties Katniss has had to endure and the importance of protecting her younger sister Prim from anything that she can, is an important theme in the book.  This leaves the question as to how Katniss is going to protect Prim from the Hunger Games.<br /> The intense details throughout the book make it feel very realistic, giving the feeling of actually being in the Arena with the tributes.  \\"The world has transformed to flame and smoke.  Burning branches crack from trees and fall in showers of sparks at my feet . . . the wall of fire must have an end\\" (pp. 13-14).  Many of the details describe a blooming love story in the midst of a barbaric scene that is outrageous and charming but also riveting.  Collin's ability to decipher where details are necessary makes the violent situations seem a little less threatening without losing the important concepts.<br /> Just when this book seems to only be about the effects of war, rebellion and death, the love story between Katniss and her male counterpart Peeta, adds an innocent spin that is heart wrenching.  \\"This is the first kiss where I actually feel stirring inside my chest.  Warm and curious\\" (p. 298).  Whether the love is real or for the show, the connection between Katniss and Peeta cannot be dismissed.<br /> Collin's portrayal of a strong and broken, but powerful girl keeps the book interesting from start to finish.  The suspenseful and captivating words keep the book engaging and very difficult to stop reading.  The descriptive story line makes it is easy to envision what the author is trying to portray without being over the top and gruesome.  Will the love between Katniss and Peeta blossom, or will the realities of life at home and the memories of the Hunger Games steer them apart?

0345531930|4.0|If you love some courtroom drama, then you'll love John Grisham. Having read Runaway Jury, The Street Lawyer and the Testament before I read The Rainmaker, I kinda knew what I could expect, but that doesn't mean I could put the book down. Hell, I even took it with me everywhere to read between every available moment. The Rainmaker is understandable enough for those not familiar with courtroom liguistics, and written in a clever, funny way. I have never seen the movie - but the book is a big recommendation!

0671034065|1.0|This novel was really contrived and I ended up skimming quickly through any talk of the Mr. Perfect list that was for some reason the main arc of the story. At one point I had to ask myself, \\"Did she seriously just dedicate an entire chapter to the main character and her friends going on GMA?\\" The romance was nonexistent and awful, which is rare for a Linda Howard book. All the talk about birth control pills, \\"eggs,\\" and menstruation between the two lovers killed it for me.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I enjoyed the hidden object components of this game. the story was a little juvenile but interesting none the less. the biggest drawback are the mini games that don't have clear instructions.  you have to wade through the story to dicipher the instructions and clues almost cresting a reason to run the entire game more than once. not sure if its worth $5 maybe $3 or more like $2.50.

0670023329|5.0|I could not put down this book once I started reading it. Just from the point of view of being absorbing reading, it is admirable.  I can't add much to what the many other five star reviews have said on that score. This book left me not wanting to write a review so much as wishing there were something we could all do about the suffering going on at this moment in North Korean concentraton camps. And there it goes far beyond being a great read.

B005C7SXMS|4.0|----------------------------------------<br />\\"Submarine\\" (2011)<br />----------------------------------------<br />Note: mild spoilers below.<br />----------------------------------------<br /><br />This British indie film focuses on the insecurities and idiosyncrasies of a teenage loner attending a private (?) school where he hooks up with a prickly young girl and tries to form a meaningful emotional relationship inside a social context of total cynicism and detachment. Meanwhile, his family life provides a perilous example, with his totally checked-out, socially challenged father seemingly about to break up with the more functional but also emotionally remote mother. As the film opened, I sensed a kinship to the \\"quirky\\" films of Wes Anderson (\\"Rushmore,\\" \\"The Royal Tenenbaums,\\" etc.) which I detest for their facile irony and contempt for their easily mockable, stick-figure characters. \\"Submarine,\\" however, kept my interest as the familiar dynamics of precocious-young-man-in-an-absurdist-world seemed to give way to something more subtle and engaging. For one thing, the narrator-protagonist didn't seem like such a know-it-all savant, indeed, he seemed genuinely befuddled and barely able to keep ahead of the curve and maintain his public front of geekish cool. The dynamics of his relationship were odd, but not the cartoonish agit-prop of the Anderson ouvre. So, for the middle section of the film I was engaged... That changed, however, with the introduction of the family's new neighbor, a clownish New Age guru prone to martial arts hyaa-yah chops and meaningless sexual conquests: here was a classic Anderson-ian stick figure, and the tenor of the film sagged as soon as we delved into Graham's superficiality.<br /><br />What I dislike about this genre is its lack of emotional resonance and the lack of respect or credence it gives its characters... The humor is facile and empty, and while \\"Submarine\\" is a genuinely darker and more uncomfortable film than any of Anderson's efforts, it unnecessarily dips into the same well just enough that I got a familiar sour taste. Nonetheless, it's an intriguing film, with some compelling performances (mainly the teen couple) and an odd, unpredictable tang that gives it just enough mystery to make it a worthwhile view. See what you think...! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)ps into the same well just enough that I got a familiar sour taste.

0312641893|4.0|I loved Cinder.<br /><br />  I've always enjoyed \\"retellings\\" of fairy tales, but Cinder is maybe the best retelling of Cinderella I've ever read.<br /><br />  You have the main elements: two stepsisters and a stepmother who despises Cinder. Though, in Cinder's case, one of her stepsisters, Peony, is her only 'human' friend.<br /><br />  'Human' because Cinder is a cyborg. In case you're a little hazy on what that is, it's basically a person who has been 'enhanced' by robotic elements/technology. Cinder has a metal hand and leg, but she later learns that she's actually 36.28% Not Human. (So, no beautiful yet ignored stepdaughter, like in the original tale here!)<br /><br />  Then Cinder's sister, Peony, contracts the deadly virus that has been raging rampant across the earth. In response, Cinder's stepmonster, who believes Cinder is at fault for Peony's imminent death, sends her off to the labs to be the new test subject. (And, of course, no cyborg has ever returned from this place...So you can understand the issue. Also, you can read the synopsis, because I'm not summarizing the book for you.)<br /><br />  Also, Cinder meets Prince Kai who seems to like her...but of course he has no idea she's a cyborg or knows anything of her other, more important secret that I will not reveal for you (tough luck).<br /><br />  Cinder is a very likable character. Her ailments are fresh and interesting. I mean, people, she can take her damn foot off! How cool/freaky is that?! Her situations and emotions cause readers to cheer her on. Well...I was. But I just really like robots. (Well, I fear them too...but whatevs.)<br /><br />  Prince Kai is okay as a character, too. I was happy to read about a character who liked Cinder, even though he really knows nothing at all about her. (Of course, I now hate him. Read the book to find out why.)<br /><br />  Then the ENDING!! It was a cliffhanger of beautiful proportions. Leaves readers (well, left me at least) wondering about what happens next, and if I had my damn way the sequel, Scarlet (due out sometime in 2013) would be released like, yesterday.<br /><br />  Loved the story, loved Cinder's tale, and I'm eager to read more about her (and Kai, I suppose).<br /><br />  If you like dystopians, cyborgs/robots, retellings and romance, you're gunna love Cinder! 4/5 stars.xt, and if I had my damn way the sequel, Scarlet (due out sometime in 2013) would be released like, yesterday.<br /><br />  Loved the story, loved Cinder's tale, and I'm eager to read more about her (and Kai, I suppose).<br /><br />  If you like dystopians, cyborgs/robots, retellings and romance, you're gunna love Cinder! 4/5 stars.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|I am a big Sylvia Day fan, so I was very excited when this book was released.  \\"Bared to You\\" is an absorbing look into the lives of two very complicated characters.  The heroine, Eva, meets hero Gideon at the office building which he owns and where she works.  From the moment these two set eyes on each other, we enter a complex relationship between two damaged but lovable characters.  Both have been victims of abuse, but they try to find their way to one another in the relationship.<br /><br />There have been comparisons made between \\"Bared to You\\" and \\"Fifty Shades of Grey.\\"  I have read and loved both series, and although there are some common elements, such as a young, rich, dominant hero involved with a younger woman, EL James and Sylvia Day have both made their universes unique.  \\"Bared to You\\" is particularly good in letting us see the toll that abuse can have on people in different ways.  I loved seeing the trust build between Eva and Gideon as they try to deal with the issue together.<br /><br />The love scenes are scorching, but Sylvia Day also did a fantastic job with the mental drama the characters are involved in.  Eva and Gideon are in a possessive, sometimes obsessive relationship that is not easy to balance.  Day is also fantastic in providing secondary characters who are not perfect, but make the book work. My favorite secondary character was smoking-hot Cary, Eva's male model room-mate who seems to not be able to embrace his own happiness.  Day also describes the world of the rich and powerful in a captivating manner that makes the reader feel as if she is in the room with the characters.<br /><br />This book is not always emotionally easy to read, but that is one of its strengths.  The reader sympathizes with the characters and sometimes wants to shout at them for making self-destructive choices.  It is also difficult to watch as Eva struggles with issues of self-esteem, a common probem with abuse survivors. Getting that involved with the characters is s sign of a great read.<br /><br />I am waiting with anticipation for \\"Deeper in You,\\" the next installment in the \\"Crossfire\\" series.  I would highly recommend \\"Bared to You\\" as a scintillating, sexy, and thought-provoking read.<br /><br />Netgalley provided me with the copy of this work.
0545123291|5.0|Linger. I think I speak for every teen when I say that we faithfully waited long enough for the sequel to last years' New York Times bestseller, Shiver.<br /><br />  In Linger, Sam and Grace have to fight to stay together. While the threat of Sam changing again and leaving Grace has been removed, Grace isn't so sure that the threat of her leaving Sam has passed.<br /><br />  Grace starts noticing changes in herself: being overly warm, headaches, nosebleeds. She tries hiding this from Sam. But, Sam being Sam, also knows something is terribly wrong with Grace. And it may just be worse than either of them imagined.<br /><br />  Enter newbie Cole: The newest wolf in town, a wolf that's hiding secrets of a troublesome past that he doesn't want anyone to know about. He's also embracing his wolf, trying to find out how to stay a wolf.<br /><br />  Isabel is also struggling with a troubled past; the loss of her brother, when she blames herself for his death. And she is trying to show Cole that his life is worth living. These two damaged souls find each other in their time-of-need.<br /><br />  Linger is a harrowing tale of love, choices and consequences. Problems that seem to be way to complicated for any teens new to love should have to experience, and a just-plain-beautiful story. Stiefvater is very gifted with words. She has woven a tale that won't soon be forgotten, and even hours after finishing it, I'm still thinking about its ending... Can't wait for FOREVER!<br /><br />In Maggie Stiefvater's Shiver, Grace and Sam found each other.  Now, in Linger, they must fight to be together. For Grace, this means defying her parents and keeping a very dangerous secret about her own well-being. For Sam, this means grappling with his werewolf past . . . and figuring out a way to survive into the future. Add into the mix a new wolf named Cole, whose own past has the potential to destroy the whole pack.  And Isabelle, who already lost her brother to the wolves . . . and is nonetheless drawn to Cole.<br /><br />At turns harrowing and euphoric, Linger is a spellbinding love story that explores both sides of love -- the light and the dark, the warm and the cold -- in a way you will never forget.ss drawn to Cole.<br /><br />At turns harrowing and euphoric, Linger is a spellbinding love story that explores both sides of love -- the light and the dark, the warm and the cold -- in a way you will never forget.

0525423281|5.0|I don't know what to say. Seriously, I just finished Lola and the Boy Next Door, and yet I'm rendered speechless! I just can't praise this author enough.<br />  If you aren't reading Stephanie Perkins, well...you're literally missing out.<br />  I feel kinda torn between which of her novels is better, but Lola shines shines shines, people. The characters, the funky way the main character dresses, the quirky and adorable boy-next-door. The rocker boyfriend, the English boy and the American girl. Gurr! I love them all!<br />  If I had to choose one word to describe Lola, it'd be fabulous. The novel is just beautiful. I swear I want marry this book.<br />  Lola is such a different character (literally, everyday she's a new one!) that you can't help but fall in love with her. She's funny, she's so relatable, she's the most original character I've been introduced to this year. I love her outfits and how they remind me of the greatest actresses in the world. I love how she can wear a blue or a green wig and rock it like no one's business.<br />  Cricket, the boy next door is so freakin' cute and awesome I can't explain it. Seriously, he's so adorable I love him more than ANY other male in a novel. He's better than the badass boys any day. I want a Cricket! And though I liked Lola's boyfriend, Max, for a little while (of course he gets the sympathy card since his GF is all off falling for another boy) I ended up seeing him for who he was all along. Boo, you suck Max! (And whooooo! you rock Cricket!)<br />  Read this. Because it's awesome and I like telling fellow book-nerds what to do.<br />  Okay, I'm starting to sound annoying with all  my praise, I shall reel myself in for the sake of my sanity.<br />  I can't wait to read more Perkins, and I've no doubt she'll  manage to top herself...AGAIN! 5/5 stars!

0316077046|5.0|If you've read the book prior to Beautiful Darkness (why wouldn't you've?) then when you pick it up, you should think 'Okay, I know where we are...' and then read the book smoothly and easily.<br /><br />  I'm just going to jump right into my thoughts here, and skip all the symbolism that I could probably use to detail the book.<br /><br />  While I loved Beautiful Creatures, I just felt that Beautiful Darkness was a little...lacking. Sure, it was just as interesting and well written as the other one, don't get me wrong, but for some reason I just felt...bored with the book. It seemed to me that it droned on and on at points. And if I'm being honest, I will tell you two things: I hate guy POV's and Lena was being a plain bitch for like, the whole book. I don't mean to spoil it for you, but she was acting so weird I was just stunned!<br /><br />  Beautiful Darkness also seemed, to me, that it wasn't as action packed as the other one. But then again, since Beautiful Creatures is the first in the series, it's bound to be with more details, action, and whatnot, right? Yea, but still. I felt annoyed, bored, awed and lastly, confused for the entire duration of the book.<br /><br />  Regardless, I'm was happy with the ending. It was well written and thought out, so I will be sticking with the awesome duo that is Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl. 5/5 Stars

0142419400|5.0|Anna was one hell of a novel! I picked up the book and didn't put it back down until I was well past the 200-page mark. Not only was it fascinating, but it was so well written I just couldn't tear my eyes away!<br /><br />  I absolutely love Anna, but really, I should say that I absolutely love Stephanie Perkins! She definitely knows what she's talking about--none of that rubbish that makes no sense because the author knows nothing about what she's saying. Perkins seems to really know about teen love/angst and how the characters would act in the situations. I can say that if given the same, I would totally act how Anna did--in each situation! She never really did something that made me think, `oh, crap,' she always did what I would have done. And that's think FIRST before acting.<br /><br />  What I really enjoyed is how the book takes place during an entire YEAR. There's none of that having to read like, four books in a series--and having it only span three months or something of the like. No, I really liked how Perkins didn't dwell on anything too long, so really, we get to know the characters, but you have to have it in your mind that this is over the span of 12-months. So, Anna is really given the chance (as well as the other characters, too!) to develop, and then I think that this gives readers a better chance to connect and relate to characters and situations.<br /><br />  Then the setting--Paris. Who doesn't want to read about an American who doesn't speak a lick of French survive in the City of Light? That alone should entertain, even without the hot British guy!<br /><br />  Anna thinks so realistically and...well, teenage-ly, it's astounding that the author isn't one herself! I thought that being in Anna's head was so fun! The book is funny, cute, and above all, romantic (although, some of that could be accounted to the setting...but not really). What more could you want in a YA book? The description promises tingling toes and melted hearts...and it doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />  Definitely one of the best debut novels I've EVER read. I really can't wait for another book by Stephanie Perkins. *5/5 starst disappoint.<br /><br />  Definitely one of the best debut novels I've EVER read.

0984725113|2.0|Automation is a complicated problem that has been subtly advancing toward a kind of critical mass for a very long time.  The authors here are correct in noting its acceleration over the last few decades, but perhaps I should say I believe the people the authors quote to be correct, since this book does very little of it's own heavy lifting, and little heavy lifting at that.  Don't get me wrong, I'd welcome a synthesis of current thought on this predicament even if it didn't have an original bone in it's body.  In fact, that might even be better than one more true believer economist with another prediction of the future. However, at 70 pages this \\"book\\" is not prepared to deal with anything comprehensively.  75% of it is reference to other people's work, borrowing from better books, quoting statistics or just stating the obvious.  I can't think of anything to recommend it over other books on the subject.  Like some other reviewers, I read Martin Ford's \\"Lights In The Tunnel\\"(which this book references) and thought it dealt with this subject matter far more realistically and with enough depth to add something to the discussion.    The initial chapters of the book attempt to lay out the problem, but only in the most general way.  You won't be coming away with a wide knowledge of the specific fields under the direst threat from automation.  There are some specific examples but few are likely to be news.  Watson the computer plays Jeopardy and wins, Google cars drive around without people, Moore's Law of accelerating growth is explained, etc.  Then on come the statistics to show us how job growth has diminished, how GDP has detached itself from household income and how all but the most extensive, specialized education is declining in value.  All of this information is quite disturbing, so what is to be done?    I was amused to see that most of the prescriptions at the end of this forward thinking little book had such a familiar ring to them.  How fortunate that this is merely one more modern problem that can be solved by market deregulation, lowering taxes, worshiping entrepreneurs and an all systems grow approach.  Perhaps this is where a deeper and more expansive survey of the situation might have been useful.  This book seems to carry on within a topical vacuum, but in reality the subject matter certainly does not.  Some of their suggestions are so nonsensical that I might've stopped reading if I weren't so close to the end.  The idea that a significant portion of the population could become software entrepreneurs in order to procure a stable income is ridiculous.  Were this to happen as prescribed, then supposedly even more people would begin to participate in the fabulous \\"superstar\\" style wealth available with a global market at the touch of a button.  That this is possible for a very few is obvious, just as it's obvious that it's not possible for most. Ok, Ok, wait, hear them out - It wouldn't be ridiculous if we fixed the broken educational system, enabling all students to get the equal and intensive high tech training they need to compete with their parents inventions...by inventing their own things to sell...for their kids to compete with.  Of course, this suggestion is unhampered by the fact that we've been trying to fix the USA's lousy educational system for, what?  Decades? Centuries?  And never mind the archaic, enfeebled plea that their may be some possible goal for education beyond success in the market.  Then again, maybe there isn't when a poor fellow's got to be out there 24/7 selling Apps just to survive.    A few suggestions seemed reasonable, such as offering green cards to foreign students when they complete advanced degrees.  I'd also have to agree that heavily reforming the patent system and copyright law will be crucial if there is to be any hope of our economy coping with the digital world.  These prescriptions were only allowable in that they fit with the authors' general answer of utilizing technology to compete with technology, which is fighting growth with growth.    The elephant in the room here that, like all good \\"digital optimists\\", the authors refuse to even acknowledge, is that the race against the machine is really the race against ourselves.  Like so many these days, they have long since acquiesced to treat technology as essentially a force of nature, autonomous and beyond control.  Maybe that IS the most realistic perspective now; maybe I'm the one being overly optimistic to imagine that we could still exert some decelerating or critical influence over it.  However, it seems to me that as long as there is an economic imperative to undercut the cost of human labor, automation will only continue it's advance, ever broader and faster.  I'm not making an argument here for keeping humanity's nose to the grindstone for all time, but let us be honest about who's benefiting from these \\"advances\\".  Unless you are the owner/shareholder, you're looking at layoffs or hyperemployment here, not more vacation days.    The authors admit that there are limits to entrepreneurial innovation, and even if there weren't, the exponential growth of technological power will eventually exceed a speed at which humans could stay a step ahead by innovation alone.  Indeed, short of a complete reorganization of our global economic system (hardly conceivable without some enormous catastrophe setting a new precedent) any great strides made by our remaining uniquely human faculties are only likely to spur more concentrated attempts to automate in that particular area.  Given that machines have already conquered so many realms once thought categorically human, it seems very naive to assume that any of those remaining with be off limits indefinitely.  This should all make for excellent political fodder in the coming years; I'm sure we can all look forward to myriad impotent, partisan psuedo-debates as income and opportunities continue to mysteriously vanish.    Despite this book, this isan extremely important subject, especially for anyone entering college or the job market.  Legal aids, radiologists, journalists, truck drivers, research assistants, retail workers and many more are all going to have diminishing prospects in the coming years, some sooner than others.  For your own security, it's best to start becoming familiar with this problem now.
B000077VR3|5.0|This movie is a beautiful love story. I love Nicole Kidman as I always have and in this movie she surpassed my expectations. I easily related it to my first and still ever love after over 40 yrs, when I first met Marsha I was 18, and she still is the one for me, though she is married to another she will remain in my heart forever. This movie stirred those longings for my first love. Though some may think the movie was long, I hardly noticed as I enjoyed it so much. I wish I could have seen it on the big screen, but widescreen is good enough. If you like love stories and musicals, you will like this movie. Enjoy it as I did.

I have to say I couldn't wait to start on the next one as soon as I finished each one. Suzanne is a colorful writer, I am considering reading the Gregor the Overlander series. My daughter and I went to see the Hunger Games movie and we both thought it was very true to the book. We can't wait for the second and third movies. Hopefully, they will keep the same actors throughout. Personally, I thought they fit the characters to a tee.

0434020362|4.0|*A full summary of this book is available here: [[ASIN:B00HLWYH4U An Executive Summary of Charles Duhigg's 'The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business']]<br /><br />The main argument: It is often said that we are creatures of habit, in that many of our daily activities end up being a matter of routine rather than direct deliberation (just think of your morning run-through). While this is no doubt true, author Charles Duhigg insists that this is but the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the impact that habits have on our daily lives. Indeed, in his new book `The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business' Duhigg argues that habits not only pervade our personal lives, but that they have an integral role to play in the businesses and other organizations of which we are a part, and that they are also at the heart of social movements and societies at large.<br /><br />The first part of the book focuses on the role that habits play in our personal lives. Here we learn about the habit loop consisting of cue, routine, and reward, and how the elements in this loop can be manipulated to help modify our habits (say from crashing on the couch with a bag of chips, to heading out for a run). We also learn about the power of particular habits called keystone habits (which include exercise, as well as eating together as a family) that help initiate a domino effect that touches all of the other aspects of our lives. Also, we learn about the power of belief--and the importance of social groups in helping create this belief--that stands behind successful habit transformation programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous.<br /><br />The second part of the book concentrates on how habits help shape businesses and organizations. Here we learn that the formation of habits and routines within organizations is unavoidable; what's more, that it is always best for the leadership of a group to make a deliberate effort to shape the habits of their organizations, and in a way that ensures a high degree of equality and fairness for its various members, while nonetheless making it clear who is ultimately in charge of each particular aspect of the operation. Second, we learn that keystone habits--which are at the center of our personal lives--are also pivotal when it comes to larger organizations (and how a particular keystone habit was applied to resurrect the once great but flailing American aluminum company Alcoa). We also learn about the greatest keystone habit of all: willpower, and how this habit can best be cultivated (and how companies such as Starbucks are employing these lessons to help train employees successfully). Finally, we learn about how companies such as Proctor & Gamble and Target instill habits in their customers.<br /><br />The third and final part of the book examines the importance of habits in social movements, such as the civil rights movement of the 1960's. Here we learn that movements tend to follow a three-part process. To start with, a movement tends to begin with a group of close acquaintances and friends. The movement tends to grow when these people spread it to the broader communities of which they are a part. Finally, in order to really take hold and spread, the movement must be guided forward by an effective leader who lays down new habits for the movement's adherents in a way that allows them to gain a sense of identity.<br /><br />On the negative side, the organization of the book is somewhat muddled, as there is significant overlap in the parts on individuals and organizations. Also, the section on social movements rests on a precious few examples, and therefore, the theory seems less convincing than it might otherwise be. Still, though, there are many things to be learned here and the book is well worth the read.

1932100660|2.0|This is an interesting book and one premise I agree with limit your intake of meat and eat healthier diet .<br /> The fact about milk not so sure about all the dietetic mumbo jumbo but people have allergies and food sensitivities and milk  or dairy is a big one . As to the Chinese diet I too have been to china and I have been to their markets and see what they offer for sale . Trust me they are things we would not consider eating and I do not mean to offend anyone but we keep them as pets .<br /> As to the cholesterol my husband was on a fat free vegan diet for 2months . There was no change . He was told it was hereditary and his liver was manufacturing cholesterol . He is on statins and it is under control .? If he was on this diet for a year would it improve we were told no and it was too long to wait without treatment . His situation was that dire .<br />Is he thrilled with choice no but he is alive and healthy and very active . Versus the other choice!!<br /> Personally I liked the book eat right for your blood type .<br /> I try and eat healthy and we eat at home most of the time however there are times I like to go out and have a nice dinner and be waited on .<br /> Everything in moderation . Education is key and do not be preachy and a zealot<br /> . As to bill Clinton he had horrible dietary habits as we would often see him eating fast food . He admitted it and nothing like major surgery to make you rethink your food choices.

1400095204|5.0|This is a book I had been meaning to read for a long time. It has been worth the anticipation and is an excellent story with characters based on real life people. The reviews already written on this site made me look forward to reading it. It gives a clear picture of the horror and unreality of Nigeria, the Biafra war, and the rise and fall of Biafra. The multi-sided confusing nature of the conflict and the appalling support in arms and money to the Nigerian army who continued to bomb starving people long after the battle was won. The story highlights the total misunderstanding by Britain of the issues involved and the mismanagement of food and medical aid meant for the war torn areas which left homeless people without medical aid and starving to death. This is an amazing story with romance and great dialogue, but which also has world parallels of what is happening in other countries now, especially in other African countries. It is a story which illustrates the horror created by political conflict and the betrayal of a small nation. Although the civil war is a main part of the book the separate stories of the characters in the book are the centre of the story with their hopes and aims for survival. This story is more chilling than the news reports at the time the war was happening, (which I remember my mother and I watching and she crying for the hungry children, and me not really understanding it all), as the book personalises the losses and the confusion of the people.<br />Good book, brilliant title, the symbol of the Biafran rising sun, however short lived that might have been.

Moral ambiguity is rampant, seasoning memorable and engaging characters. The dialogue is magnificent, and the storyline will leave you gasping, groaning, and cheering. Fancy spending some tome on the edge of your seat, unable to put your book down? Then read this brilliant and refreshing series, and let Mr.  Howey take the post-apocalyptic genre for an absolute joyride.

First he slept with his wife, but instead of backing off he kept pursuing her...And his wife, I can't believe she actually got mad at him for killing Shane.  I wanted to slap her twice.  His son needs a good butt whipping, and Daryl turned out to be pretty okay.  I started off wanting to hate him, but he's an alright guy.  T Dogg is there for what? I mean I like his character okay, but I would have rather him die than Dale to be honest.  And I can't BELIEVE they left Andrea.  That wasn't like Rick at all.  Can't wait until season 3...
B004LWZW42|5.0|This was an enjoyable item to place in my library of action CD's.  No flaws to be found, clear presentation of material.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|best game I have played in the of logistical and logic in one game. I recommend this for people who enjoy thinking.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|After reading the entire trilogy I'm left hungry for even more.  I am amazed at how two characters can be so fascinating TOGETHER!?  As a reader you are sucked into this world which is such delicious fantasy and yet connected to real emotion.  I think I could read the entire trilogy again.  Watching and waiting for more of these Fifty Shades!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is good but gets boring fast. I suggest getting the free version and seeing if you like it. And if like this one don't bother getting the experiment one because it is almost the exact same thing as this one with a weird man always laughing in the background.
B003YCIE68|1.0|At One Time While At Mimi & Bubba's House When I Placed a Recorded VHS Copy of \\"The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking\\" into the VCR. As Soon As I Got to the Beginning of the 1988 Film, Some Weird Movie Entitled \\"Santa Claus: The Movie\\" Shows Up in its' Place. So I Turned This Movie Off and Thought About Buying the DVD Copy of the Same Movie, Along With Disney's High School Musical and Disney's Summer Magic, Online Through Best Buy. But Now I Take My Own DVDs (Even the Pippi Longstocking Classic from 1988) with Me to Mimi & Bubba's House to Watch on My New PlayStation 3. Santa Claus: The Movie - Bad. Disney's Hannah Montana: The Movie - Good. Next Time, Buy a Blank VHS Tape Just to Record Both \\"The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking\\" and \\"Disney's Hannah Montana: The Movie\\" at the Same Time. HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL ALL THE WAY! There Could Be A High School Musical Christmas Special Which Had Santa Claus (Tim Allen) at the North Pole, Purchasing New Toys (Including a New iPhone) Through Online and Delivering Them to the East High Students Especially Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Anne Hudgens). There Are Other Christmas Movies Besides Santa Claus: The Movie (1985) - Christmas with the Kranks (2005), Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000), Prancer (1989), The Polar Express (2004), Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and To Grandmother's House We Go (1992).
B007KQ6XYY|3.0|this game is ok but totally a RIPOFF compared to the regular one. it is the same thing except a weird guy saying random stuff in the background. don not recomend
B0054JZC6E|4.0|decent set of apps can get a tad boring though a lot of play time involved to unlock all of the gamed
B007SYWFRM|5.0|didn't think it would be much fun, but after I started to play it got fun real fast. my mom dad and I all play. very time consuming.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've used this and other weather apps on my I phone and Android, but this is by far the best.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|not to bad for a Mario. knock off free makes it better!  good game for all ages!  I gave it a 3 because of the knock off factor
0646497855|5.0|The book consists of many hints and advisices for IELTS Exam. I suggest to read the book before taking the exam to avoid the tricks. Anyway, the book is helpful and important for the people intend taking the exam. Good luck everyone.
B007HJ8RTI|2.0|Boring story to watch unless you just want to see endless breasts and overly violent gore.  Both of which would not be so bad if the story was really interesting.  I found it hard to stay awake after the first 20 minutes.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|It started off into the story faster and kept you reading. As the second book in this series it started to really build more foundation for more books. A very nice captivating read !
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Download! This is a great recreation of Mario. Good game. This should be in every kindle fire owners game library.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|I just couldn't get into this book right away. It wasn't what I had expected. It was a good read all the same. Although this was my first Kindle book so part of the confusion could have been from that.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I hardly read the books description but kept seeing it high on the top 100 list, so I gave it a try. Once I started reading it, the first few chapters were \\"blah\\" and I considered putting it down, but then the story opened up and I wanted to know more about Ana and Mr. Grey. My need to know more has led me to the third novel in the trilogy and I am still hooked. I don't want it to end.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Awesome game! Very soothing to figure out the puzzles. Music is relaxing also. The interface is simple and elegant. Charming.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After finishing the first novel I couldn't wait to begin this one and finished it in no time. Love the story and the characters!
B002R02FBS|5.0|this is the uk 4-disc ultimate version, everything is the same as the usa 4-disc ultimate version except the movie title, which doesn't bother me at all, and it's so much cheaper than the usa version. definitely a good buy. worth every penny!
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Another good book by Lee Childs. Jack Reacher is cool, calm and collected as usual. The sex was a little over the top.... I'm not that sure that we needed to have quite so much detail on his exploits in the bed.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is a great game. some people say it is bad but I love it. you should get it,  it is great.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I love this app. However, I do not love that when it freezes &amp; I have to restart my kindle &amp; open the game again, all my crops, businesses, houses &amp; animals say there's 180 hours until I can collect again. It's happened to me twice now &amp; the only way I can figure out how to fix it is to uninstall &amp; reinstall the game. This time, I'm not reinstallling unless the issue is somehow fixed. I'm incredibly disappointed because I love this game &amp; don't even mind waiting for the energy to refill (I do other things &amp; come back to the game later). I'll miss playing on my Kindle Fire, but the game hasn't messed up on my android phone yet.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great product!  Lots of fun! I would recommend it highly. Many hours of fun can be expected playing solitaire.  You can't go wrong. Give it a try today.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great free Bible app with many different translations available to download to your Kindle Fire. The app also features a Bible reading plan which can be used with a widget.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very very  awesome game. This game is pretty cool and it passes time quickly? GOD and JESUS are AWESOME! GOD and JESUS are AMAZING!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|angry birds is a fun game for kids that like many games. I like angry birds because it is fun.I also think u will like. angry birds.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I really liked this book. My english teacher knowing how much I love reading gave it to me.And I have to admitt I read it in two days and loved it.It was fast paced and a strange tale Im excited to see if there is a sequel in the near futre
B003VANOFY|2.0|At first glance the headset works great. Long range, comfortable, crystal clear sound. After a week of use, the range decreased to 15-20ft before it cuts out. At close range (5 ft or less) the signal cuts in and out constantly. The ear pieces randomly do not work without the charger cable plugged in. The software conflicts w/ (overrides) Logitech non-gaming software, making it so my ordinary mouse can not be customized.<br /><br />I do not suggest anyone purchase this product.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Outstanding.Fantastic.Beathtaking.Fabulous. Chilling.Are just some of the thing I can say about this book you need to read this it will satisfy all types of genres historical truth. suspensful. love story. funny. I would pay 20 bucks for it.
0316098329|4.0|I have to admit, although I found it difficult to get into the book initially, once I got past the first 30 or so pages, it was well worth all of the effort! I was fascinated by this little boy's perspective on his life in the room. You really feel an incredible amount of sympathy for him and his mother. It's a unique little book, which I highly recommend checking out.
0634022296|5.0|The lyrics and the chords, all on one page.  That's what I want.  This book claims to have essentially everything.  ALL of the Beatles songs.  So far I've found all that I've looked for.  The chords seem very reliable, and the [[ASIN:B000M74WXM book clip]] that I bought with it is serving me very nicely to keep it open to the right page.<br /><br />This book's description says it's for a \\"strumming guitarist,\\" but what they mean by that is that it's just a chord chart and the lyrics.  It's great for pianists, guitarists, and anybody else that just wants the chords.  Don't get me wrong, it can be nice to have something more than chords sometimes, but if you're like me and you almost never use the notes on the staff, it's great to have a book that doesn't have them at all.  They're not worth the page real estate to me.<br /><br />I'm really glad I bought this book.
B0055SWM08|1.0|as soon as I started playing this game I noticed tons of pop ups this made my kindle freeze and crash.worst game ever do not get it it ducks!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0307341550|5.0|I love a well written mystery,  and this is a beautifully written, sharply observed mystery of a small town in Missouri and what goes on behind closed doors.  Camille is forced to go home for work,  to report on the second child missing case there - do they have a serial killer on their hands in her small town?  She escaped to Chicago 10 years ago,  but quickly finds herself pulled back into life there.  Every detail here rings strong,  from the teenage power circles to the industrial hog farming.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book and it's haunting,  sweaty air of horror.  Would definitely look for more by Gillian Flynn.
0439023521|4.0|My order came right on time and in good form. The cover seemed a little worn, like it's been pressed between something and moved around a little, but it's not very noticeable. Other than this small detail, the book is in perfect condition. No bent pages, no rips, no scratches. It was perfect. Thank you!
B0071MV540|1.0|DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME....this movie was just plain awful.  Poor comic timing, sad setups, and implausible plots, uggg the list goes on....yuck!
B0053JJLLC|1.0|This is far, far from any semblance to what Michael Crichton would have produced, other than an interesting concept for a story line. However, the development of the plot was sophomoric-this almost reads at an elementary school level. I couldn't get over how Mr. Preston (let's face it, this is his novel, not Crichton's)used simply embarrassing wordage. If you want to read this novel, don't waste your money on buying it, simply check it out from your local library.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it....great game and good graphics. I would recommend anyone to play it. very good game for all ages:))))
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|good. I like it a lot. its fun. you should just go out and play it everyday for rewards. it is very addicting to play
B0058VW36U|4.0|Personally, I am not a fan of angry birds: I find it very hard and sometimes boring, but I would still give it a high rating for the app quality and creativity, and it does offer some entertainment. That's why I gave this app 4 stars; it's very cute, and I think that if you like games like angry birds, you're going to like this. And I have to admit, I did feel guilty if I couldn't get the candy to little Om-Nom!

B007IXWKUK|4.0|I am emphatically not a romance novel kind of gal, and my occasional forays into this genre have always been disappointing.  The writing is usually bad, the stories are weak and the characters are unbelievable and sometimes downright laughable.  But all the buzz around this book had me intrigued.  So I downloaded it and began reading without expecting too much.  The first chapter seemed par for the course in romance, not very well written and sort of amateurish.  But I kept going and hello... what is this?  A male romantic hero who is into bondage...my stomach was doing flip flops by the time the first sex scene hit.  Holy cow, by the third or fourth sex scene, there was a paradigm shift in my world.  Hunky millionaire dominant meets gawky young neophyte and sweeps her off her feet would usually not be a description of a book that would appeal to me in any circumstance, and yet I found myself unable to put Fifty down.  After I finished number book number one, I immediately downloaded book two of the trilogy and continued on.  And I was rewarded, as it just got better.  Not just the sex, but the relationship.<br />The relationship between the main characters is what really sucked me in (along with the hot sex)  These two people have complicated feelings for each other built on a seemingly improbable premise, but they keep working on it primarily through talking and improving their sex life.  What a novel idea, building a great sex life in addition to great communication.<br />While feminism brought us much needed independence from men, our own voice and ability to control our own destiny, it also attempted to negate the idea that a woman should enjoy being dominated. I am quite sure that I will be slammed for making this next point, but women are complex creatures, and I think we may be hard wired to enjoy both independence and domination. Sacrilege for a twenty first century woman to say such a thing, but something about the idea of my husband pinning me to the bed,spanking me and telling me I am \\"his\\" makes me go all weak in the knees.<br />And miracle of miracles, in Fifty, the characters actually talk about their limits.  What is a hard limit and what is a soft limit, so each of them know going into the bedroom, what the other is willing or not willing to do.  And they talk about this with regards to their relationship too.  I think the many reviews of Fifty out there that focus on its appeal being the \\"S&M lite\\" sex it delivers or dismiss the book as \\"mommy porn\\", have missed the boat.  The appeal is the way this couple works out their problems and continually has great sex while doing it, because they actually communicate with each other.  Granted, the whole multi billionaire meets ingénue portion of the story is farfetched, but the dialogue between them as they make efforts to figure out how they can make their lives work together is filled with an honesty and frankness that real couples often struggle with.<br />My husband read the book too, and he commented that it seems like the characters represent just the right blend of what a woman wants in a man and a man wants in a woman.  I tend to agree with him.  I think romance novels are generally written to play to our more primal instincts as man and woman; this novel is different because it happened to nail just the right balance of base instinct and relationship savvy for the era we are in.  And reading this book made me feel that it is ok to be a strong, independent, self sufficient woman and want to be in a relationship with a strong, dominant male who will possess me as his woman.  (As long as we can talk about it, of course)  Despite tens of thousands of years of evolution, those primitive \\"me man - you woman\\" instincts are still deeply ingrained in us, so why fight them?  Embrace them and enjoy the hot sex.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|cooooool :)  this is the best ever and I so rock at it... I told all of my friends to play this game..
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a great game, you can easily sit and play for a few minutes, or for an hour or more. The controls are intuitive, and the graphics look great. Definitely worth the price of admission
B007OUFESC|1.0|I couldn't wait to see this movie and expected it to be great.  I love Cronenberg's work especially History of Violence, and I adore Viggo.  They usually make a strong team together...but not this time.<br /><br />Here are my pros/cons.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Viggo and Michael both acted well<br />- Nice history lesson<br /><br />CONS:<br />- I agree with some of the reviews about Keira Knightly's severe overacting.  It was painful to watch. A character that is very mentally disturbed does not necessarily have to talk all weird and make seizure like motions.<br />- I understand psychoanalysis involves talking, but the movie has a length, and within that length, it needs to engage the viewer.  The talking and conversations were so excessive that I lost interest.  Perhaps this was intentional so that the viewer was part of the psychoanalysis process?  Extremely boring unless you put in A LOT of effort to really pay attention to every word being said<br /><br />Is it worth renting/borrowing?  No.  Would I recommend to others?  Only if they want to fall asleep.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|very fun my kids love it. just good clean fun you can build hunt expand farm explore. very fun game
B007AMMHSY|4.0|This isn't one of the best movies for me or one I'd want to watch again.  However, I appreciate the originality of the story and the outstanding execution of it.  I agree others that this felt like a movie master piece in terms of how the scenes were shot and how the story unfolded like peeling an onion.  I liked the layers of the story and its characters.<br /><br />Here are the highlights.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Solid acting<br />- Great casting<br />- Visually appealing<br />- Well executed storyline (and what a story!)<br />- Characters had depth and were well developed<br />- The beginning and the middle kept me intrigued<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Rape scene (I always appreciate a heads up on that)<br />- I agree with some of the reviews about the ending.  It was a simple ending.  I expected some kind of emotional break down or something more intense.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this movie and am glad I watched it.  Would I watch it again?  No.  Would I recommend to others?  Yes, definitely for some.  It's not for everyone.  I wouldn't recommend it to my parents for example.
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|I have no idea about anything involving cameras. But when I discovered this would let you see through cameras world wide, I had to have it. I love it, it's like traveling to exotic locations without having to fly there.
B007Q476KU|5.0|I just watched War horse and can appreciate the mixed reviews but relate to the 4 and 5 stars. This was a touching, moving, entertaining, beautifully shot story.  For this reason, the length and some slow parts of the movie can be forgiven.<br /><br />Here are some highlights.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Great acting & casting...Emily Watson played the wife/mother beautifully...<br />- A feel good story that shows you bravery at its best<br />- Amazing horse scenes (made me appreciate the work/effort that went into making this movie)<br />- Outstanding cinematography<br />- Great characters (I loved the little girl and her grandfather)<br />- Some scenes moved me to tears<br />- A fulfilling ending<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Yes, the movie might feel long to some<br />- The beginning and the ending were fantastic but I admit the middle seemed a little scattered at times which could have made some viewers feel the length even more<br /><br />I love all types of movies, but it has been awhile since I have found one that I want to watch over and over again like this one.
B004SBULWE|5.0|I love this app, it saved me so much battery and it shut down pesky apps. I'd set it on aggressive and just have it shut everything down every time my screen would turn off. Danke danke!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I was playing, and really enjoying this game, then all of a sudden I'm waiting 137 hours for my energy to replenish and houses to charge taxes? if this problem isn't fixed, I'm just going to have to unload this.. and I really enjoyed this.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Simple puzzle game that becomes more difficult the further you play. Nice tutorial and description of new puzzle pieces as they are introduced. Smooth play and calm music.
B000RZIGVS|2.0|I am one of the lucky ones who bought the individual seasons early on. Mine came from<br />Columbia House. The packaging is extremely well-done and should hold up well for years<br />to come. Very slick. And the video quality couldn't be better. I don't see these around<br />any longer. Sorry for the newcomers. Have hope tho'. Perhaps some generous soul(s) will<br />be willing to part with their copies altho for Heaven only knows what reason !
B00275EHJG|4.0|As part of the rest of the series of this movie, its a great movie. Came packaged securely and had no issues with the movie itself or the packaging.
B007NYODBS|1.0|4 people, arguing over their petty children's scuffle. It lacked depth. I couldn't make it past the moment where they came back inside, to have scotch.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|We love NCIC. Its the best series on television. The product came in sooner then expected and as usual, it gets better with each episode and season.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this is a great app no matter who u are as long as u like ice age you will like this
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. the graphics are beautiful and the game play is fun. you can play without having to spend money like many of the other games similar to this. highly recommend for all ages. plus you get watch ice age cartoons occasionally.perfect game!
B007MNV5WU|1.0|I herd on the news that if you install the game for your device then it allows hackers to control your device
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to learn and. fun to play! Not too challenging. unless you insist on it. Terrific time waster.<br />Two thumbs up!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game keeps you very busy. lots of different things to do.  build hunt fish shoot a little bit for everyone
0439023513|2.0|Loved the first two books. This one was so different. All about war, very slow and depressing. I was hoping for more. Ending felt forced to be happy. So disappointed as the first two wrer great.
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|I love this action flick. first off, The blu ray package was in excellent condition, and the movie itself was really good story!
B0034G4OZE|5.0|This movie does a tremendous job of taking reality and comedy and mixing them together perfectly. It was easy to identify with the main characters in a very real way, but there was enough laughter that it wasn't emotionally exhausting.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This version of solitaire is a good way to challenge yourself. It is a fun way to show yourself that you can indeed play the game of solitaire. It is fair because if you make a mistake it will let you go back with the undo button. It is also fair because if you're struggling it will give you a hint if you press the (I bet yoou are guessing this) hint button. Anyways this is a game that I enjoy,  and I'm 11.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|I've been waiting for this movie to come out on Blu-ray/DVD Wacka Wacka combo pack since the day I learned that they had started filming! Kudos to Amazon for shipping it to arrive on the day of release. Can't beat that service!
B006B3A5AA|5.0|The Roots have been one of the few bands, (hip/hop or otherwise) - to have consistently made great albums over the past 20 or so years. Unlike most hip/hop artists, The Roots are extraordinary musicians. While their first album were very Jazz influenced and groove heavy, their last couple have been much more reliant on a bit more standard hip/hop hooks and beats. When I head they were coming up with a concept album, I was thrilled! The concept is the undoing of a man named Redford Stevens. (A fictional name that combines indie rocker Sufjan Stevens' last name and a name of one of his songs). The album chronicles the downfall in a Memento like reverse order. As great as this album is, the one minor flaw is that the beats and instrumentals are a bit more repetitive than most of The Roots work.<br />Best tracks: The Other Side, Make My, One Time and Lighthouse.
B007R41E8O|1.0|I've tried everything and still can't get it to load. Don't bother with this game. What a waste of time.
B0059XTUVI|2.0|The movie had a lot of promise but essentially fails if its task is to provide a fair portrayal of the former U.K. prime minister Thatcher. Ms. Thatcher's accomplishments are substantial and have influenced the world greatly. The movie's primary focus is her battle with Alzheimer's and the movie is a series of flashbacks as perceived through the veil of the illness. Why the illness is so important to the movie maker, I am not sure but I can only suspect a desire to diminish the stature of the prime minister or of her accomplishments. A chronological movie would have been a much more accurate portrayal. Mere minutes are spent on key events such as the battle of the Falklands, the end of cold war, and many others.<br /><br />Meryl Streep does a good job in her role as Ms. Thatcher as she often does in any role.<br /><br />You might find some nuggets of value in this movie but don't make it your sole source of information about Margaret Thatcher.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game so much fun easy to play very active you don't get bored very good game would defantly reccomend it
0307266303|4.0|It's a great book; lots of adventure and true stories of incredible runners - motivating.<br />I would suggest it for anyone who has any interest in running or needs motivation.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is the best app i have ever gotten. graphics rock and i almost unlocked every single blade. totally worth getting!
B0071MDA2U|5.0|After reading Delirium, I couldn't wait to read this book.  Read almost non-stop.  It was a quick, good read.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the book and will recommend it to my teenage granddaughter.  Both books can be enjoyed by all ages.  These were my first read by Lauren Oliver and I have to say they won't be my last.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game challenges you to think outside the box to solve its puzzles using simple paradigms that, together, amount to a powerful skill set essential to completing the game. The puzzles themselves are very well-designed, some of them incredibly complex, but they still manage a simple, elegant atmosphere unique to this game. Every level brings something new to the table, testing your abilities and forcing you to apply the skills you've learned in new ways.<br /><br />In short, this is one of the best games I have ever played on a handheld device.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It excellent to entertain kids n me too....but has so many ads which Sucks n is very annoying..... but overall like this it was good
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this its very addicting and fun! its confusing at first but it gets easier as the games progress. these games are amazing time wasters ;)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy the gamw bc some of the mini games are chalenging but i end up getting it and some i dont have to try ar.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is so fun. you get to make your own community and you get to decide what to do. 5 stars
B000AOEMXM|4.0|Enterprise was a great show!  The only problems that I seemed to have with it were that it didn't seem like the cast really cliqued.  The other problems were that it seemed ahead of it's time, and there was no real connection between the original series, which it was suppose to take place before, and Enterprise like there was with the other shows.  But over all, I really enjoyed Enterprise through the original run and now I can watch it all over again.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|I gave this to my brother who is a huge fan.  He was so surprised and ecstatic upon receiving this.  He loved of course having all of the episodes and the content...I read reviews about the packaging and he said it was weird in some way then went right back to gushing about plots and extras that I couldn't understand.  Enjoy.
0143120530|5.0|A very interesting book that has made me think a lot more about everyday experience and memory.  I really like the history of memory, dating back to the ancient Greeks and the fascinating business of memory today.  The author is a very talented writer and this is a highly readable book.
B000000OS2|5.0|Teslas one of my fave bands ever. This is acoustic at it best! Get it now if you enjoy good acoustic rock!
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this story, mostly for how much it made me feel about Kevin's actions.<br />A lot of anger!. Hard to put it down. I couldn't imagine how a child like this came to be. Was it his mother's fault? Did her negative feelings during her pregnancy and his infancy produce such a little monster?  With all the referrals to Columbine and other incidents that have happened over the past years, I could visualize this as a real-life saga. I was a bit disappointed, but also relieved, to find out it was just fiction, fortunately. It was very believeable and anger-provoking.I would like to see psychoanalysis of Kevin.
B000YMJA7I|5.0|Very good!! Love me some GNR and these were all my faves rolled into 1. I even ripped it onto a cd to listen to in my car!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I can't believe how awesome this game is. I have literally spent hours playing. the levels are challenging and fun. I try not to use hints but some levels had me stumped! wonderful game.
B007P3TMW2|5.0|This movie portrays profound love in so many different ways...love among family members, love of, and by neighbors and strangers, love for an amazing city, lost love, and found love, and misunderstood love and the never ending love of a son for his father!<br /><br />This is an incredibly powerful movie!  A must see!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I have really enjoyed this game, and it is fun. it seems similar to farmville. I just don't like that the energy runs out
B0055SWM08|4.0|I'm enjoying this game so far. It's a great brain teaser and despite some of the harder levels, it's very relaxing :) I love the soothing music.

0345803485|5.0|I heard about this trilogy on a morning talk show. It was said to be hot & steamy and there may have been brief mention of the BDSM. I've been married ten years with three children and BDSM does not play any role in my lifestyle but the trilogy did interest me. My most steamy read up until this point was the \\"House of Night\\" series. lol<br /><br />So I gave the book a chance and so far I have only read \\"50 Shades of Grey\\". I have to say it's a great read and so much more than a trashy romance novel. The characters are so captivating and the love story so addicting! I enjoy their sense of humor and enjoy \\"watching\\" their relationship grow.<br /><br />More than that though is watching the characters, both so unfamiliar with how to maintain a healthy relationship, figure out how they deserve happiness. They seem to each have a personal struggle with recognizing love and knowing what to do it, realizing they deserve it. Anastasia struggles with believing she's loved. I think it's a struggle many people, women especially, face in their lives. A lesson many of us have to learn.<br /><br />It's funny because what I had heard on the morning talk show is that husbands are happy their wives are reading it and now I can see why. It does a little something for your sex life. I can't wait to read \\"50 Shades Darker\\"!!!
0812416643|3.0|I guess a lot depends on how you approach this book.  As a fiction, it had beautiful language and images but left me feeling like I was reading an elevated remake of The Pilgrim's Progress.<br /><br />As a work of inspiration, or a companion to one's own spiritual journey, I think it does better.  I probably would have appreciated it more had I been in a more spiritual period of life.<br /><br />Overall, as I said, the writing is beautiful, but this is not a book to read simply because \\"it is on the list.\\"  I think it has much to offer, but one needs to be in the mindset to receive it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|i cannot believe how violent this game is. i wouldnt allow any child under 18 to play this. you can torture small animals that come out of the woods for money and you can use drugs and gruesomely cut up your villagers if they misbehave GET THIS GAME NOW

B007MNV5WU|3.0|I was looking forward to playing this app on the free version but greedy Amazon has to make a &quot;Kindle Fire edition&quot; to the game as an accuse to make money, just like what they did with Angry Birds Rio the &quot;Kindle Fire edition&quot; is no different from the regular game. So don't wast your money here side load the app or download it free in the Android Market.
B0076NKNLA|4.0|This movie prompted me to see the real Marilyn Monroe movie that they are supposed to be filming in My Week with Marilyn, The Prince and the Showgirl.<br /><br />I really think Michelle Williams captured the essence of Marilyn.  Of course, the real Marilyn's eyes spoke in such a way that no other actress can replicate.<br /><br />I appreciated the story in this movie because it showed another side to Marilyn which helped to explain her pain.<br /><br />On that note, see The Prince and The Showgirl.  It is, perhaps, one of my favorite MM movies!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|i got the app and its pretty good. i mean the mini games arent half bad but the controls are awful. also after every mini game there a stupid advertisment and it gts on my nerves. but other than that its a pretty decent app
B00005MP58|5.0|True to Austen's book, the dialogue and actions are truely entertaining! A long-time favorite of mine since first introduced to me on VHS. I now own it on DVD and watch it on my ipad and iphone. It's one of the few non-anime movies I whole-heartily enjoy! Everything from the script to the acting and the directing came together in wonderful harmony. The newer movie versions, lacking several hours, do not hold a candle to this magnificent piece of work put out by the BBC.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I really like the game so far it reminds me of Mario with the twist of the Irish I'm going to keep playing to see if it gets better or worse you never know with some of the games

1400069289|5.0|I have never given much thought to the intuitions and motivations behind my everyday habits and daily routines (both good and bad) and Mr. Duhigg offers illuminating insights behind these behaviors, with appropriate references to the science behind the study. Given Mr. Duhigg's background as a journalist at the New York Times covering business and current affairs, the examination of business habits is equally rewarding and further strengthened by the parallels drawn by the habits of individuals earlier in the book. In both instances, Mr. Duhigg offers practical, actionable recommendations to individuals and corporations alike with respect to how to break habit chains and instill positive habits. My only critique is that each topic could have merited its own volume with even more examples and analysis, but this is a worthy introduction to the subject matter for the inquisitive layperson/C-level executive.
B006OKOZGU|5.0|So often Blu-Rays just cause me to shrug. Not this one. I know that there are many technical links in the chain between the camera negative and the file ultimately contained on the little silver Blu-Ray disc and many opportunities for weakness, especially for a movie more than 55 years old. But this one may just be the most real, you-are-there and lifelike disc I have ever seen. Kudos to the nameless engineers who made it happen. Great work, all.<br /><br />The film catches its principals at the height of their powers. I can't add to the accolades that already appear on this board. I am grateful, however, that Bernard Herrmann was not the composer this time, Lyn Murray instead. Benny would have just been wrong for the tone and lightness that TCAT needed.<br /><br />One gripe: most of the extra features again consist of random blathering by members of the Hitchcock clan. Mindless, goofball platitudes. Pat, when asked what single lesson she got from her dad says (and I am not making this up), \\"He told me to just be myself.\\" And this Drew Casper guy is seriously creepy. I'm not sure why Marian Keane was not involved; her participation would have added extra insight and viewer pleasure.
B0059XTV7Q|4.0|W. E. is a handsome film, co-written and directed by Madonna, which deals with the scandalous romance between Edward, the Duke of Windsor, and his American Duchess, twice-divorced Wallis Simpson.<br /><br />Like JULIE & JULIA, the picture tells two parallel stories.  One deals with Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish) an unhappily married woman during the 1990swho is totally obsessed with Wallis Simpson (Andrea Riseborough), and even imagines having conversations with her.  Indeed, in one of these fantasy moments, Simpson turns to Wally and snaps, \\"Get a life!\\"  The other story follows the path of Edward (James D'Arcy) and the woman who caused him to abdicate the throne of England.<br /><br />The actors are excellent, as is Madonna's direction.  The problem with this film is that the modern story, which dominates, is really not as intriguing as the historical one, even though we know how that one will turn out.  Unfortunately, it's apparent from the start how the fictional Wally Winthrop's saga is going to end also.<br /><br />The movie does, however, make some interesting points about the difference between the legendary \\"fairy tale\\" romance and reality.<br /><br />Oscar Isaac, Natalie Dormer, Richard Coyle and James Fox co-star in the film, released in a 3-disc (DVD/Blu-Ray/Digital) set by Anchor Bay Entertainment.  The sole extra is a well  done \\"Making of\\" featurtette.<br /><br />© Michael B. Druxman

0805209999|4.0|This famous novel tells the story of Joseph K, who is accused by unidentified agents from an inaccessible and unidentified agency, of a crime that remains unknown and unnamed to Joseph K and to the reader.<br /><br />This novel is very demanding, and it's not an edge-of-your-seat page-turner by any account. So why read this book? Well, first of all, although the language is rather simple, it is still beautifully written. Secondly, this is one of those books that make you contemplate the role of the individual against a totalitarian system, and the struggle of the individual against a vast complicated network of bureaucracy. This is not a light read by any stretch either, however, it is very rewarding for those who willing put the necessary effort into it.

B000HEVZ6W|5.0|\\"I am here to tell you that it is possible, that it IS possible\\". --Vincent<br /><br />I have watched this movie 3 times since its box office disappointing release 15 years ago.<br /><br />I am now convinced this is one of the greatest films of all time. I don't say that lightly. I watch a LOT of old films and watched most of Roger Ebert's top 100 films of all time. In my opinion, this movie belongs in that list.<br /><br />What makes a film great? To me, a greatness of a film is measured similar to a great music. A great music can be enjoyable, visceral, fascinating even after repeated hearings and many years of absence. This movie has that quality to me. Even though I knew its plot and its ending, the movie kept me fascinated and drawn into the characters unlike most films.<br /><br />Made with shoe-string budget and awful marketing (it was marketed as an Orwellian futuristic film which doesn't do it justice), the movie is about the triumph of the human spirit and how everything becomes possible once we commit our heart and soul with ruthless determination. \\"You want to do how I did it? I never saved anything for the swim back\\". Committment, dedication, determination, belief...everything IS possible.<br /><br />The movie, however, is mindful that no one achieves success alone. Why would anyone help someone to misrepresent himself so he can achieve his dreams? Vincent is helped by Jerome (genetically superior being), Irene (his love interest), and a doctor (who tests urine samples). Even Vincent's nemsis (Anton) finally gets out of his way once he understands the power of Vincent's heart and determination. I believe people help Vincent because, in the end, no one really cares what advantages one is born with. We care far more about the human side of individuals. Vincent is someone we all can admire, and his positive qualities can't be bought or predetermined with genetic disposition. When we encounter such individuals, we are sometimes even willing to sacrifice our self-interest for them.<br /><br />This films hits all cylinders, including all the emotions (love, betrayal, desire to win, hope, jealousy). I cried in couple of moving scenes. In my humble opinion, this film's greatness will be appreciated and validated with the passage of time.self-interest for them.<br /><br />This films hits all cylinders, including all the emotions (love, betrayal, desire to win, hope, jealousy).

B007IXWKUK|4.0|Yes, the \\"Fifty Shades\\" trilogy is total smutty trash. Yes, it's a total rip-off of the \\"Twilight\\" series. Yes, most of the plot is entirely predictable. No, there is nothing literary about these books whatsoever...and yet I absolutely LOVE them! \\"Fifty Shades Darker\\" was even better than \\"Fifty Shades of Grey,\\" if you can believe that's possible. There is just something about these two characters. The love story of Ana and Christian just pulls you in right from the beginning. I find that I have actually become desensitized to all the sex scenes because there are so many of them, but the story is really what holds my interest. I cannot wait to see what happens in the final installment of the series. If you are looking for something mindlessly entertaining to read, I highly suggest this trilogy. Love, love, LOVE it!

B0077ZNCE2|1.0|Most of these films have been somewhat entertaining but I have to wonder what the point of splitting this book into two parts could have been, other than to sell more tickets. There's almost no story here. Edward and Bella get married and have a baby. That's it. What was the point of dedicating an entire movie on that? And the only people who could find it engrossing are pre-teen girls who know nothing about marriage or babys. This should have been left as a footnote to the larger story from the book. As ONE film. Not two.
B005WGBQ9G|1.0|This is my first time buying a HD amazon video (b/c I loved Walking Dead season 1 so much on Netflicks) but was sad to see that regular AND HD versions are un-captioned on amazon.  I'd never have paid the $5 for these 2 shows had I known Amazon isn't as progressive as Netflicks for hearing impaired folks like me.  Save your money for Netflicks when WD season 2 comes out if you need to read the mumblings.

B000OCZD5G|5.0|Movies don't get more exciting and heart-pounding than George Miller's The Road Warrior (1981). Released theatrically in the same year as Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), The Road Warrior is every bit as influential and exhilarating as Steven Spielberg's cliffhanger bonanza. That it was made on a meager budget of $4 million proves that great movies can succeed on quality, not quantity.<br /><br />As every action fan knows, The Road Warrior is the sequel to the apocalyptic original, Mad Max (1979). In the original, Mel Gibson played as a patrol cop who lost his wife and child due to a brutal gang and exact vengeance on them Charles Bronson-style. In the sequel, Max, along with a feisty mutt, goes on the run, searching for gasoline to keep his car going while avoiding dangerous outsiders who control the alluring highways. Max comes across a band of rebels, whose attempts to escape to safer, higher ground have been thwarted and imprisoned in an oil refinery thanks to a sinister motorcycle gang led by the evil Humungous. In exchange for gas, Max offers his service to the band. But like Ethan Edwards from The Searchers, in doing so, Max discovers something that he lost a long time ago...his own humanity.<br /><br />I've stated many times that The Road Warrior is a great action movie. But words cannot describe how exciting and well-done the action scenes are. But I'll do the best I can in that regard. The opening scene where Max encounters Wez and his posse is riveting enough but the scenes where Max drives a semi-truck back to the compound while dealing with the motorcycle gang and is ambushed after ending his services with the band are also exciting.<br /><br />Then there's the final car chase where Max uses a trucker as a decoy to lure Humungous and his army away from the escaping oil marauders. Joining the pantheon of great movies with great car chases such as Bullitt (1968), The French Connection (1971), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Diva (1982) and Speed (1994), this final car chase is simply mind-blowing. At the hands of an amateur exploitation director, the action scenes would come across looking confusing and sloppy but thanks to Miller's tight direction, great pacing and exceptional editing, these action scenes are both easy-to-follow and engaging without being overwhelming to a normal moviegoer.<br /><br />But to talk about the action is to overlook the acting and visuals, which are also the key ingredients to the movie's success. Cinematographer Dean Semler, who would go on photograph the likes of City Slickers (1991), Dances With Wolves (1991) and Apocalypto (2006), creates an apocalyptic Australia, a vast world of desert landscapes and empty highways where danger lurks behind every intersection. The costumes and makeup are also stylish, with the punk mow-hawk elements worn by Humungous' army being the standout. Humungous, in particular, looks like a real menace with his hockey mask, lack of wardrobe and his enormous muscle mass. Like Star Wars, the technical staff in The Road Warrior successfully bring to life a \\"used future\\", a future that is neither pristine or polished but gritty and cynical, appropriate to the movie's apocalyptic theme and setting.<br /><br />Because the movie conveys the meaning and acting through visual means, it's no surprise that dialogue is not heavily emphasized here. It's actually a smart move by the filmmakers because the dramatic scenes wind up being more resonant as a result. In a scene before Max and the obnoxious gyro captain enters the oil refinery, the two look down on the carnage ignited by Wez's gang on a group of innocent bystanders. As the gyro captain looks on, we see one of the gang members shoot an arrow at the woman who is offscreen. The scene then cuts to gyro captain's reaction and his horrified reaction speaks volumes. Similarly, Max spends less time talking than observing his surroundings and thinking about his situations. But like Clint Eastwood in Sergio Leone's The ManWith No Name movies, when he talks, it feels eventful. When Max expresses his services to the good marauders and later tells them he will drive the truck, you get the feeling that you're in the presence of a real-life hero.<br /><br />Speaking of expression, the acting in the Road Warrior is very good and over-the-top. Typically, I can't stand performers that overact but in this case, it's actually appropriate. Most subtle of these performers is, not surprisingly, Mel Gibson. As Max, Mel Gibson portrays a quiet loner with a nihilistic outlook on humanity. But by the end of the movie, as Gibson discovers his humanity, he becomes a warmer, more likable main character and Gibson's acting helps his character fully developed throughout the duration of the picture. On the other side of the spectrum are the villains Wez and Humungous (played by Vernon Wells and Kjell Nilsson) and Gibson's companion Feral Kid (Emil Minty). Wells is wildly over-the-top as the crazed lunatic biker that slaughters his enemies without ever being fazed by arrow shots. When The Feral Kid murders his male lover, Wez snaps and becomes a raging psychotic in a manner that could have been laughable but is actually riveting to watch. Nilsson is the quintessential main villain: towering, immense and with a voice (presumably dubbed) that epitomizes psychological warfare. As the Feral Kid, Minty brings an animalistic quality to the character but also a youthful innocence that makes him an endearing character. The Feral Kid can be as child-like as E.T. (as seen when Max gives him a small musicbox) and as vicious as Rambo (what he does with his boomerang) and Minty makes that character change work without being sloppy and awkward.<br /><br />The Road Warrior stands as one of the best action movies ever made. Unlike many action movies that come and go because of their inability to create intelligent stories without resorting to pyrotechnics and fast-cutting to keep audiences awake, The Road Warrior works because of its gripping story, memorable characters, exceptional pacing and, of course, the action scenes themselves, makes it a breed apart from other stuntman movies where story is less valued than the stunts.<br /><br />Don't walk away from this movie.<br /><br />Strongest recommendation.With No Name movies, when he talks, it feels eventful.

B002OHROJM|5.0|The blu ray UNCUT version of The Tudors is WAAAAY better than the DVD version, not to mention you can tell the difference in sharper images, and everything feels more real. The Tudors 1 and 2 are my favorite seasons, except for the end episodes where Anne Boleyn gets beheaded. She is my favorite Queen of all time, and I feel sorry for her for what had happened. She was tried and found guilty of crimes she did NOT commit. I wish I could go back in time and change events that happened, to save her from being killed. One of them being that Henry gets hit in the head with the joust, and another would be that Anne and he get together intimately BEFORE they get married timing it, so that way they have intimacy at the perfect time to be able to conceive a son. Also, to get rid of unwanted characters that would hurt her future chances. To also give Henry some medication because he most likely had a lot of diseases that hurt the babies as well. This is a tragic story of what happened to her, but I would suggest buying the Blu ray versions, because they are simply the best!!!

I do not expect to fall into a story so intense, so passionate and so confrontational.<br />If you looking for a peaceful love story, pass your way. But I'm sure of myself when I say that if you decided to start this book you will not be disappointed!<br /><br />The author has blended different atmospheres and universe. A friendly, studious and festive one created by the scenary of this story: a university with a campus, dormitories, classrooms and student parties.<br />Then the atmosphere changes when the reader enters the electric mood of \\"Fight Club\\" with combat scenes full of blood, rivers of beer and violence that enhanced  the piquancy of the forbidden that emerges from these fights banned. Amazingly captured by the author!<br /><br />This novel intrigued me, amused me, annoyed me, touched me and sometimes confused me a lot... Incredible characters that move you, that it's hard not to fall in love. We fight with them, we cry, we laugh...<br /><br />A wonderful well written emotional adventures.

I loved this book because it made me react.<br />A beautiful discovery that I recommend!<br /><br />Lucie<br />newbooksonmyselves.blogspot.fr
0525423656|5.0|#26 Book Read in 2012<br />Crossed (YA)<br /><br />This is the second in a young adult dystopian series.  Readers definitely need to read the first book, Matched, because Crossed picks up right where Matched left off.  Cassia is on the hunt to find Ky and she gets herself assigned to a work camp near where she believes she will find him.  Cassia connects with another girl, Indie.  In the meanwhile, Ky is burying bodies with Vick and Eli.  The three boys decide to make a run for the Carving, a range of mountains where they believe they can hide.  Eventually the girls and the boys connect and join forces.<br /><br />This was a good read.  Crossed focused more on the action and the search than the romance aspect of Matched.  This book leaves off in an interesting place and I look forward to the third book, coming out in November, I believe.<br /><br />[...]

B00005CDUE|1.0|What I absolutely hate about this album is how they destroyed Angel Eyes with the Disco beat. Angel Eyes is one of the greatest Roxy Music songs. I got this album because I could not find Country Life. Imagine my surprise when Angel Eyes came on with its chinka choo beat. I threw the disc away.....Roxy Music albums should be enjoyed from begining to end. Country Life is a great album to start with if you want to rock out. Manifesto is an interesting album. Roxy Music is like a painting. Check into anything from Avalon and before and it would be better than this album..

B007PTJOV0|4.0|Yes its a Mario copy and obviously. not as good as the original. but it is free and fun...mostly easy but can be challenging at times. I would RECOMMEND!
1250004217|5.0|De Rosnay has captured what it was probably like in WW2 France and I could not help but get caught up with all the emotions of a family that was in a living hell. This book flows so well and all the characters are bought in a well structured manner. I especially like how she has described the personalities.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|Heard him by happenstance and instantly enamoured....fabulous singer with a voice as smooth as silk and the funk to backit up...can't wait to see him in Montreal this summer at the Jazz Festival
B00785P2QC|4.0|fun but controls are a little annoying to get used to. great time killer objectives come up to fast too
B00785P2QC|4.0|i love this game. this is a fun game and great way to waste time. greart graphics plus an easy interface  to learn
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I loved this book! The chaotic, and emotional love story of Abby and Travis is brutally beautiful! Sure they have issues and problems to over come but relationships aren't always rainbows and butterflies....right? This was one of the best books I've ever read!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is a very interesting way of playing Mahjong.  It keeps my interest up and I've got other things to do.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is so fun and addictive. I enjoyed playing it with my son and continue to do so. I began looking for similar games for my son.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|well I herd it was amasing and I herd in was ok and I here Its teribal I'm not shore if I should get it and don't now who to belive so I wonder how it is.???????????????
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I guess I'm just nuts but this game just seems to fulfilled that longing I've had for more Ice Age. Cute easy game,  love the characters,  and good to play anytime.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Great for my 6 month old, helps keep the pacifier from falling out of his mouth while he's trying to go to sleep (he can still spit out the paci or pull it out), he likes handling the monkey and getting the pacifier in by himself.  I wish I had this when he was a newborn because it would have really helped me when I was trying to prop his pacifier and using a rolled up blanket instead (which made me nervous and I removed it after he fell asleep).  The soothie style pacifier is sewn into the mouth.  If you're looking for something compatible with other pacifiers try searching for \\"paci plushies\\".
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Sims like Oregon trail its fun! this is an awesome game for my free time! a little addicting though. I will probably play till I beat it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Fun!!!  Great down time killer. Gonna play this a lot between books get it if you like fun. Plus reminds me of the old Oregon trail.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|The movie looks as great as in theater, 3D is really good handled and the extra content is good enough. The movies itself, in case you did not watch it, is not as good as the first title, I can feel a total difference context but still is good as a SCI-FI movie. This is one of those titles that is really appreciated on HD because of the visuals.
B005HSL626|1.0|crashed my kindle fire. days to fix it. revenge time soon.  I bate it.  don't get it if you have a kindle fire.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|This book gets results. I used to weight train to no avail. I spent lots of money on shakes and supplements to get the Chyna look. It didn't work. I got to a point where my body just stoped after about six months. I don't think I look like chyna but I am makeing progress and not spending nearly as much money.
B00005JPD0|4.0|The movie kept me interested as well as confused. I'm not a fan of time travel stuff, but Denzel pulled it off. Denzel goes back in time to save a young woman's life and to stop a ferry from being blown up by a terrorist. I love the way little details came together after Denzel traveled backwards (bloody rags at Claire's apartment, the ambulance in the burned out structure, etc).<br /><br />Unfortunately Val Kilmer added nothing to this movie.<br /><br />Even though the end results were predictable I still enjoyed the film. Everything worked for me except the final, sappy-sweet ending. How did Denzel pull that off? Who saved him? It confused me further, but I still liked the movie.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that I didn't know existed until I ran across it at the video rental store. It's been out for years and it's certainly worth the rental price.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Super fun! I sit up all night in bed playing it. Its pretty addictive and bad if you have OCD.
0312641893|4.0|I wanted to purchase \\"Cinder\\" for the longest time.  I couldn't believe the hardcover price so I ended up buying it used through Amazon Marketplace.  I just noticed that at the time of this review, a new hardcover is down to about $10.00.  This book is so worth that amount.  I breezed through this fairly thick novel in just a couple of hours of reading time.<br /><br />The story spins a new 'twist' on the Cinderella storyline.  That in itself isn't all that tunique however what the author does with the story is definitely one of a kind.  Our heroine is Cinder, a cyborg.  She is mostly human but has robotic parts for as long as she can remember.  But she can't remember anything before her 11th birthday.  She was brought into her family by a man who died shortly after she arrived.  Her stepmother Adri resent having to care for the cyborg, and sends Cinder out to the marketplace to work as a mechanic.  Of course all that revenue goes right back into Adri's pocket.  She also, naturally, has two step-sisters.  Pearl is nasty and hateful.  But young Peony is sweet and she is Cinder's one true human friend.  Iko, the family android, is Cinder's other best friend.<br /><br />The setting is a future New Beijing after World War IV.  The planet is mostly at peace as they have a new concern in the Lunars.  The Lunars are the people who live on the moon.  They are believed to be an evil, soulless race that is ruled by evil Queen Levana.  Levana wants to marry New Beijing's young Prince Kai.  She says she wants to use the marriage as a form or peace treaty or alliance with New Beijing but really she has more nefarious plans.  Queen Levana also might have something to aid them in fighting the deadly letumosis plague that is killing off a large portion of the population. One day Kai comes to the marketplace needing his android fixed and meets Cinder but doesn't realize she is cyborg as she keeps those parts of herself covered.  The meeting starts sparks a chain of events that you have to read to believe.  I keep wanting to write down more of the details but I don't want to spoil anything.<br /><br />I was worried at the beginning of the book because so much was going on.  We have the cyborg issue making Cinder feel like an outcast.  We have this deadly plague which causes heartache for Cinder.  We have the evil stepmother out for Cinder.  The friendship with a Prince and his secret.  The worry over the Lunar people and the impending effect of Queen Levana on the New Beijing people.  But all those plots really weave together quite seamlessly.  Cinder is a really great heroine, very believable in her worries and loneliness.  Yes, due to the nature of the Cinderella connection, there are several events or twists you can see coming.  That is just fine because its so much fun reading to get to those points.  Also there is a fairy big twist that I think is supposed to be a surprise but the minute the idea is introduced everyone who reads it will figure out what will happen.  Maybe this should have been cloaked a little more for suspense purposes.  Even that didn't really bother me.<br /><br />I thought this book was a five star book for the majority of the story.  Once I closed the book though it started to sink in as to what was bothering me so much.  The story is part of a series so we know going in that there are issues that will be unresolved.  However, I really felt like everything just stopped.  Not really a cliffhanger as we know it, but just boom...the book was over.  I didn't like how incomplete everything felt.  I am giving the book four stars because I think the ending could have been better written.  We want to be left on the edge of our seats, but something out of all those storylines should have been resolved.ave to read to believe.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was reading the NY Post one day and came across a three page review of this book. Manhatten housewives claim it is tantilizing and erotic and \\"makes you want to have sex with your husband\\". They simply call it \\"The Book\\" its so good. Intrigued, I bought it for my kindle (it was only five dollars then). I couldn't even finish the book. Boring. Maybe because I am in my 20's I don't need to fantasize about sex with anyone else other than my husband. It wasn't very well written either. I could not bear to read the main character say \\"Oh my\\" breathlessly one more time or hear about her inner goddess any longer. The sex wasn't even interesting. Had it been, maybe I would've continued reading.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|there is so much to do I love this game you think it would not be good but it is super fun
B003NX75B8|4.0|As far as John Green books go, this one was not my favorite. The book was pretty good overall but the ending was unrealistic. Also, although I adjusted to the lowercase writing in every other chapter after a while, it didn't really add anything to the book. As far as books go, this one was pretty good. As far as what I was expecting from John Green, I didn't get what I'd hoped for.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Its not like the original Oregon Trail, in a good way. Works fine on my Kindle Fire. My only complaint is not being able to rotate everything.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am very pleasantly surprised by this book and could not put down.<br />Yes, it can be considered an erotic novel but please do not let that perturb you.  This is much more a love story with some incredible twists.  The character development is complete and fulling.  I personally fell in love with the main characters.<br />The book had my crying by the time I had read only 1/4 of it.  I was sobbing at the end.  (Yes, SOBBING....and downloaded Book 2 immediately)<br /><br />On a side note: It WILL help improve your libido. ;)
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Great apparently, great app, funny game. I like it . Download it . You will like it. Enjoy it please.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My kids love this game, they play none stop .The oldest is 14,he is on level 30.Love you all. Awesome game
B001ANSS5K|4.0|This was a John Green read that took me a while to get into. I wasn't really sure where he was going with some of the things that took place in the book. Sorry to be so vague, but I don't want to spoil anything. That being said, once I did get into it, I couldn't put it down and I loved it. The characters were well developed and easy to relate to. If you're looking for something deep to read that is going to change your life, this isn't it. If you are looking for a good read, go for Paper Towns.
0525478817|4.0|Classic John Green in that it is smart, dry humor and also poignant. I bought it for my self and a student and we are doing a little book club. She LOVED it and has read it several times in the week I gave it to her. As an adult I don't LOVE it, but as a teacher I really do.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|when you turn it on you cant turn it off. I had to totally shut down my kindle to turn it off.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Awesome new Macca's release. Like homemade. He just sings and plays. His voice is older but still beautiful. I imagine Paul sitting at home near fireplace and singing My Valentine.... Awesome...
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun game for whole family kids love it jus<br />t like movie reminds me of tiny village that's a good game too
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|If this isn't my favorite of all the books I've read, it is definitely #1 out of anything I have read recently. The characters in the book are well developed and realistic. I laughed, I cried and about a million other cliches. Seriously though, I really did bawl my eyes out while reading the last few chapters of the book. This book is worth your money. Buy it! Read it! You'll love it!
B004XVN1T4|3.0|To me, this is middle range spies' book. The plot is more or less credible. The characters are quite well described. This author likes to include in his novels sex passages (with a commercial aim, I believe). All in all, you can enjoy this novel provided you do not look for something outstanding.
B004XZDT60|5.0|I love his voice so much and his talent. I keep listening to this CD over and over again, and now I have memorized every word to every song! It's GREAT.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Love playing it. Will keep the kids occupied. Good for little kids. For a free game it is good. lol
B006KX3GXO|5.0|well I think this app is amazing. It has so meany cool things you can do with your photos.Also you can see other people's photos and its really cool. I use this app all the time and think I always will.
B0063IH60K|5.0|User friendly and straight forward. No complaints. App has great options and is fun to play. Have thoroughly enjoyed this app more than others I've gotten.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Brings me back to the days of dragon warrior and the original final fantasy games. Great controls for the world and battle and good graphics.  I love this game, played it all the way through and I'm still playing it after I beat it. One issue with the touch controls, when you have to go to either top corner of the screen where the menu and map buttons are, the only way to get past are to switch to the joystick control, then switch back afterwards. It only happened a few times but was annoying. Also, if your character moved first, you had to be really fast to perform the break move for them, also annoying.
B004VF68AQ|5.0|Its definately a mellower album for Jane's Addiction, but Im really liking it.  Favorite tracks have been Words Right Out of My Mouth, Underground, Irresistible Force, and Twisted Tales.
B0049VGTGA|5.0|Phil Collins might not get a lot of respect from older rock fans now because of the string of R&B influenced hits but the fact is that he made some terrific pop music in addition to his work with Genesis and past work with jazz fusion band Brand X.<br /><br />\\"Face Value\\" remains, for me, his best and most adventurous solo album--at turns commerical and pushing the boundaries (\\"In The Air Tonight\\" which has a strong influence evident from Peter Gabriel's third solo album from the composition itself to the production courtesy of the engineer of that album Hugh Padgham with the gated drum sound)it's a terrific album filled with honest, direct songwriting (so much so that I feel Gabriel used Collins album as a departure point when he made \\"So\\" 5 years later).<br /><br />Regardless, the big question here is whether or not the original standard CD or the newer gold CD issued from Audio Fidelity are the the ultimate edition. Let me be clear--the original CD mastered by Barry Diament sounds terrific--nice detail, clarity, dynamics, midrange and, considering that Diament was working from an analog copy of whatever the UK used as the master).<br /><br />Steve Hoffman who remastered this CD went back to the original master tapes for this edition (although it's not noted on the packaging because Audio Fidelity has had to use--particularly in the case of the Stevie Wonder remasters--safety masters or copies when the original master tapes were not available)has done a great job with this reissue. Will you hear a difference? That really depends on 1) where you're going to listen to this 2) your equipment and, ultimately, your ears. You like what you like. If you've found that the difference between between remasters that receive praise and the original CDs isn't that much of an improvement, you'll probably hear little or subtle differences. If you just like to crank these up in the car with the windows down, it's not likely you're going to hear a lot of difference. If you listen, on the other hand, with headphones or focus on little things like the warmth of the mastering, etc. you will notice a difference.<br /><br />I'd have to give the edge to Hoffman's master in a number of listening environments (my main system, in the car, on my ipod, etc.)as depth, clarity (due to improved A/D equipment)and warmth are all improved. Again, your mileage may vary so that's something to consider. I do wish that AF would use SACD as a format (I also understand why they don't--expense, the profit margin is thinner, less plants to press, a bit more complicated QC, etc.)but that's not part of this discussion really.<br /><br />I can recommend this--you'll hear improvements largely dependent on your ears and your listening environment so if you're satisfied with you hear on the regular CD and are immune to subtle differences, you may want to spend that money somewhere else. Nevertheless, this is a great sounding remaster but the choice is ultimately yours.on the other hand, with headphones or focus on little things like the warmth of the mastering, etc. you will notice a difference.<br /><br />I'd have to give the edge to Hoffman's master in a number of listening environments (my main system, in the car, on my ipod, etc.)as depth, clarity (due to improved A/D equipment)and warmth are all improved.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the different games.  my favorite is the bow and arrow game. I have a really high score on it.
006197806X|4.0|While I completely respected the transformation Lena was having from the first book to the second book, I wasn't too happy about this suddenly quick connection with Julian, this boy who she is supposed to hate. The one who doesn't want people like HER, Invalids, existing!<br /><br />But I am happy about the element of \\"thinking for oneself\\". Julian was taught all of his life what to think about the world, deliria, and people with or without it.<br /><br />BUT COME ONNNNN!!! JULIAN AND LENA VS. ALEX AND LENA<br /><br />Lauren Oliver should have known that many readers wouldn't be happy with this love triangle that every book and tv show seems to jump onto the bandwagon with. I personally think Lena and Alex's love for each other is WAYYYYYY TOOOO genuine, strong, unique, and IMPOSSIBLY built on a story so beautiful that JULIAN could suddenly erase!!<br /><br />It was obvious that Alex was going to show up, even as Lena continued to convince herself that he was dead. Obviously somewhere in her heart she was weakened and Julian sort of filled that space, but... LOVE? Really?? I can see the love that Lena and Alex had.. but Lena seemed to care about Julian way too much on foundations of what??? PITY because of his life story, cancer, dead brother? SADNESS because of his emotionless father? HELPLESSNESS in trying to make up his own mind of the love disease and whether they could die at any second because of it? DEATH?? INJUSTICE ACTS??<br /><br />That's what their love is built on.<br /><br />And personally, I feel that that won't be enough in the end of it.<br /><br />In conclusion, Pandemonium was AWESOME and it is getting me pumped for what might go down in the third and FINAL book!!!! :)<br /><br />p.s. honestly, i was somehow wishing that julian and alex would be brothers in some strange crazy way lol just a guilty fantasy
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game I know its a rip off of Mario but they don't have Mario on the kindle so this game. is good enough
B004EPYZUS|4.0|\\"Your mission, should you choose to accept it...\\" After a mission goes south and the Kremlin is attacked and partially destroyed the IMF division is blamed. This event causes the government to cut all ties with the agency. Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his team of now independent agents are in a race to stop a mad man from starting a nuclear war and prove that the IMF is innocent. I have to admit that I have liked all the movies in this franchise (except the 2nd one) and was looking forward to this one. After a long hiatus I have to admit that the series is back with a vengeance. The action and gadgets were great as always and this one seemed more real then the others to me. There were a few call back shots to the other movies which made it more interesting to me. The addition of Simon Pegg really was brilliant and he was my favorite part of this movie. Jeremy Renner is one good character away from being the star of his own franchise and I have a feeling that will happen soon. This is a must see for all action fans, not just fans of the series. Overall, not quite as good as the first one but this has come the closest of all the sequels so far. I give it a B+.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I've been trying to download the app for my phone, but the amazon store won't let me. Which is funny, since it claims to have a brazillian portuguese interface AND it does say it is compatible with my phone, still I can't download it because of \\"regional restrictions\\". One does have to wonder if Brazil isn't elegible for downloading the kindle android app why is there a interface specially developed for our language.<br /><br />It is a big let down, specially since the pc app and the cloud reader work so well.

This cd makes me wish I'd known about it sooner!!! The more I listen, the more I really enjoy this piece. Stunning imho!! Music for the soul...
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Suzanne Collins masterfully captured the survivor's mindset, Katniss, Peeta and Gale' confusion, conflicting emotions, fears and the deeps scars of their violent experiences coloring their lives.<br />This fictional post-apocalyptic story transported my mind to those times when survival was every day game. My sincere compliments to Mrs. Collins for addressing the long term impact, the emotional scars violence/war in kids. Education on these subjects is essential in our culture controlled by a broadcasting media industry that manipulates and legitimates violence and war.
B00136S0NE|5.0|I remembered this earthy, ethereal pair from the Oscars a few yrs ago, thinking 'Falling Slowly' such a refreshingly different song, and rejoicing when it surprised everyone and actually WON. After watching the movie, I had to have this soundtrack. So many good songs and such a variety as it bounces between two very different musicians: Glen, with his rough-folksy, slightly obsessive style - and Marketa, classically trained in piano, with her delicately haunting, bird-like vocals.<br /><br />The counterpoint they weave here (a couple of her songs/vocals, mostly his songs/vocals) is an enchanting and emotional journey. One slight flaw - the 'Hoover Fixer Sucker Guy' song would better have been omitted. The Irish song 'Gold' seems out of place, yet fits the overall theme and gives you the feel of the c&eacute;ilidh in a scene around a dinner table - after all, the film was done in Dublin. Most of the journey is about disappointment and yearning in Love and the struggle of moving on in life - and with yearning for a person you want, but can't have.<br /><br />Oscar for Best Song, well-deserved.

0123694965|5.0|I'd like to add to the long list of overwhelmingly positive reviews of this book with a slightly different perspective, a lens called the \\"Lens of The Annoying Book\\":<br /><br />Is your book annoying?<br /><br />* Does it waste valuable paper and time covering technical details of tools and languages that could easily be looked up on the web, that many readers will already be familiar with, and that will soon be outdated anyway?<br />* Does it define terms in absolute or sloppy ways that make you think \\"Actually I don't think that's true in many cases?\\"<br />* Does it talk about a lot of important and closely related ideas such as \\"fun\\", \\"play\\", \\"toy\\", and \\"game\\" in a way that makes you feel more confused about these terms than when you started, or that the author is more confused about them than when you started?<br />* Does it go on and on about how the game industry is expanding and how this is the perfect time to be a game designer? Does it go into tedious detail explaining the difference between a 2D and a 3D game, explaining what the \\"Freemium\\" business model is, and explaining how you might have to pay for server hosting if you are making a multiplayer game? In short, does it spend a lot of time explaining things that as a reader of this type of book you very likely already know or could easily look up?<br />* Does it make you feel like the book is more for people who one day thought, \\"Huh, I've heard of computer games, I wonder what all the buzz is about?\\"<br />* Does it have a random collection of interviews with industry giants that have no particular coherence and can only leave you with the feeling that, yeah, I guess everyone does it their own way and some people are just game geniuses, and I'll probably never be one.<br />* Do you read it for a while and then you step back and think, \\"You know, this guy is talking a lot about a certain type of game, but these points don't have much relevance to the game I'm working on, or to the specific questions I'mstruggling with\\"?<br />* Does it say a bunch of useless truisms, like that the best-selling games are the ones that are \\"addictive\\"?<br />* Is there no overall flow to the book? Do you feel like it could have been much shorter and said the same things? Do you feel it could have been organized better? Do you feel it could have used another round of editing before they pressed the Print button?<br /><br />If you answered yes to some of these questions, your book may be annoying. Consider rewriting it to make it less annoying.<br /><br />I am pleased to say that, miraculously, this book is NOT annoying on any of the above counts, or in hundreds of other ways that it could easily have been annoying.<br /><br />In fact, even for someone who thinks they've done a lot of clear-headed thinking about games, this book makes you feel like you're just waking up to the fact that game design is pretty much the ultimate challenge and reward for a certain type of creative mind, that games and play are fundamental, critical parts of what it means to be human, and (best of all) that basically anybody who has the sincere interest, and who can learn to listen well, can reasonably hope to make games that people love.<br /><br />I mean, within the first few pages the book calls out that the single most important skill a designer can have is the ability to really listen. How great is that?
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game!  It is so different from the other village games.  There are also lots of the cute ice age  characters (:
B005BK95SC|5.0|Whitney Houston was one of those singers who could actually send magnetic power into the croud that was present. This is an amazing quality, but it also drains the singer. However the croud always expects this power output, that is what they came for, and eventually to elicit and maintain the manic event requires an additional battery pack. The album is a terrific one and radiates great power and is very well recorded. It is very highly recommended. The world and her family will miss her very much.<br /><br />This item was purchased at Amazon at a very reasonable price, and I am very happy to have this memory.

B002GY9F9K|1.0|I thought if they followed the books the tv series would have lasted much longer than two seasons, the 12 books are amazing and not you avarage fairytale.

1439148953|4.0|It was so refreshing to read about a charachter (Eilis) who is not dysfunctional, but rather an \\"old soul.\\" The book was a delightful read although I would have liked the ending to be expanded--what choices did she make. I guess that is the sign of a good book--I did not want it to end the way it did. Overall, I loved reading a sweet book. I could not finish \\"The Weird Sisters\\"--too much dysfunction.
B005KR6OBM|1.0|I like to deal with amazon for my book purchases online and was looking to see what this series would cost... I looked at sears like several of the reviews said... it is now (4/15/12)  $39.99 for the complete seasons 1-4...  is this simply a MAJOR screwup... or is this the way it is with ALL videos?  If so... I will know to look OTHER PLACES for any videos/movies from now on...
B003PIUBZS|4.0|When I got this DVD set I wasn't sure what to expect since I don't watch the cable network Starz, which airs this series. This is an action-oriented historical-based drama with a solid cast and dynamic plots filled with sex and violence and raw language (so this is not suitable for children). If you don't mind the graphic nature of the series you will probably enjoy this a lot, since it has well-developed characters and drama and the production quality stands up well to what you'd find in a major motion picture. I was pretty impressed with the quality of this series, even though I wouldn't be inclined myself to be a regular viewer of a graphic drama - at least not at this stage in my life. As media has become increasingly graphic, it's not surprising that shows are becoming more edgy in this regard. In some cases the graphic content is there as an authentic depiction of dramas that really occur. Tales with violence, sex, and power struggles can certainly make intriguing drama, and modern productions tend to be more explicit and less implicit in depicting these storylines. However, as a society we may want to consider looking for more prosocial stories to entertain and inspire us. Spartacus fictionally depicts a fairly dark chapter in Western civilization, doing so in a pretty gripping way. It is good entertainment in that sense, though I personally prefer being gripped by films and shows that inspire a vision of a more conscious, harmonious civilization.
B003JSSPSY|1.0|The books by TerryGoodkind were so amazing that it is no surprise they failed to bring his vision to tv, thats why it lasted 2 seasons when 12 books were written.
B007LE3PXW|5.0|This is one of the best albums that I have ever owned!  I had listened to some songs (I'm Addicted, Turn Up the Radio, Some Girls, I'm a Sinner, Love Spent, Falling Free, Beautiful Killer and B-Day Song) on YouTube and they sound great, but when I purchased the album, I noticed that these songs sounded different.  They were different because on YouTube, she sounded like she did in the 80's, but then on the real songs, it was toned down.  I still like the songs, but not as much.<br /><br />My Top 5 songs are...<br /><br />1) Girl Gone Wild<br /><br />2) Give Me All Your Luvin'<br /><br />3) I Don't Give A<br /><br />4) Masterpiece<br /><br />5) Gang Bang
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Fun way to waste time by completing goals. Wish getting energy didn't take as long, but very fun to play.
B0076UXKDG|1.0|The reviewer who compared this to Apple was right about Nikon but hasn't a clue about Apple (though Mac accessories are also overpriced).  This is a plastic battery holder.  Nikon should be ashamed.  Buy aftermarket and spend your savings on an iMac... you'll never regret it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|so far I love this game.  is it on facebook or elsewhere on the computer?would love to play it more than just on my kindle!
0440539811|3.0|Don't even try to make sense of this lunacy, you'll only hurt yourself. Just buckle up and enjoy this whiplash-inducing ride through the shadowy corners of history, occult lore and just about every conspiracy theory since the snake tempted Eve (or did he?). All this and kinky sex!! Reading \\"Illuminatus!\\" is like having multiple schizophrenic madmen with ADD and a handful of bennies explain their conflicting theories of the universe to you all at once. It doesn't make a lick of sense, but it's entertaining to listen to the raving. At first, that is. After it goes on for hundreds of pages, you start to wish everyone would shut up and be happy and docile and let the government run things. I feel simultaneously proud and sort of foolish that I read all 800 pages of this nonsense.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|lots of fun to play..takes awhile to build energy unless you have friends or pay cash fir it but otherwise its a nice game ..especially since it was free!!<br /><br />UPDATE: too many glitches after you get so far into the game...quit playing due to this.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|ok, its making me pay to keep it???!!! I'm very confused. it says pay 100000000 coins to keep the game and has a deadline!? anyone please answer!
B005EGXTEE|5.0|to be honest, I picked up this book because of the over hyped Hunger Games that is playing in cinemas not so long ago. But after reading a couple of pages, I am totally hooked. And I bought the Catching Fire & MockingJay straight away. This novel blasted me off to my wild imagination, one of the best utopia style novel that I read so far..<br /><br />The story is fast pacing right from the very first page.. it is full of action and details. It has successfully drowned me into the story. The plot is excellent, the world details is superb! I love it, Love it love it so much. It gives me a very enjoyable read.<br /><br />I have to say the story is PG, not too dark but twisted with a very good surprise. Love the way Suzzane Collins wrote it.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />Hunger Games, may the odds be in your favour!!
0451529065|5.0|This book should be in the drawer next to the bed in every hotel in the world. While reading it, you'll see the true genius in Charles Darwin as he write about his observations on the natural world of creatures and their evolution over time. Darwin was way ahead of his time and I think it's truly amazing that his theory held up over time and he made this happen without the technology that we have today.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is really cute and fun to play. It can save up to three different games which makes it nice for multiple people to play their own game. Yes it does have a lot of similarities to Mario but that's not why I got the game. It has its own personal touched too. Very fun game. I would recommend it.
B0034XTCFE|4.0|\\"I hate this place.\\" --Jack Bauer<br /><br />At this point, I already want Jack to get on the damn plane and be done with it. Which says something about the way this series is. JACK just wants to get the hell outta Dodge himself but feels compelled, as always, to stay and save the world.<br /><br />As the viewer, I feel the same way. \\"Run, Jack! Get OUT!\\" But we know he can't. I feel compelled to stick with him and see it through, thinking, \\"By God, eventually SOMETHING has to go right for this guy!\\" I'm going to be biting my nails until the end.<br /><br />Jack rocks.
B0058EBNAO|3.0|I used to love this app. I recently updated it and I didn't like it. I uninstalled and re-installed it. It was much worse. The interface is a lot different. I no longer have Forca on it. Today, the daily forecast says high in the 80s and the hourly doesn't show it getting above 50s. Please fix soon.
0439023491|4.0|I dont know how to write this review without any major spoiler.. I'll start with saying that it continues where the first book \\"Hunger Games\\" finishes. And dont worry because this book jammed with action, kind of romance and good story.<br /><br />Still loving the character's development, the story line and the twists!! Yes of course it wont be much interesting if there is no such a twist!<br /><br />Do not hesitate if you like the first book!
B005K17RU0|3.0|I don't use it often. or pay too much attention at least. I was hoping it would have a bigger view on the screen on my kindle fire.but its hiding in the top left corner. it works great and its nice to know how it feels outside so I know how to dress. overall I like it for a free app.
B006ON41FC|5.0|love it .love the outfits the thing wears. toddaky rekimed it<br /> it is sooo fun and play it allow the time its a must get
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is just amazing...its so well plotted and perfectly paced that...I cant put it into words. I will just say that I read this book in 1 day and I cannot wait to see the movie. The Hunger Games is the best book I have ever read and I have read probably millions of books in my lifetime. Amazing job to Collins and GO TEAM PEETA!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very easy to navigate! enjoy playing with my 6 and 3 year old. Am going to recommend to family and friends.
0525478817|5.0|John Green is just amazing in my eyes. He knows how to be funny in sad moments and bring you back to Earth when you think the world is a fairy tale. He does a great job of mixing in relevant pop culture or language that makes you feel as if you could be one of the characters or know one of them. This all helps him to force you to read his books with the eagerness of Christmas morning. I cannot get enough of John Green.<br /><br />Also be sure to check out his Webisodes on youtube, well worth it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was originally opposed to the entire premise of fighting to the death, with kids being entered into an arena of such brutality. I opened this book thinking it was not something I could stand to read about. BUT....I literally could not put the book down! The lessons interwoven into the savage Games was so engrossing, so riveting that it transformed this reader completely. The correlations between the Capitol and real government were eye-opening! The lengths that society will go to for entertainment is shocking in the read, but highly relatable. This is one book I will think about for a long time. The reader is transfered into their own arena as final victor, but it goes beyond the read. Incredible. Secondly,I did view the movie and read on to Catching Fire, but, the Hunger Games opens a new era of reading.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really love this game I recomend this to any body who likes backery story or stuff like that it really is a addictive game I played this for an hour it rocks
B0054JZC6E|5.0|play. this game it is so cool bettern than enemy game play play play play play play play play goooooo
B005VTS4EY|5.0|I love this game. you have to get rid of all the red blocks but keep the green ones on screen. I'm on leval 32
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very good game with wonderful graphics. I really enjoy this game its very cute. If you like the movie then you will love this game
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think this game is the best game ever. another game by game loft that I would recommend is asphalt 6. that is a great racing game but anyway you should use your money wisely and this is a great way to do it. it is for all ages kids and adults. so I just hope that after you read this review you will see why it is such a great game to get. first the graphics are great and there are little fun mini games in it. also you can see a funny clip from the real movie that is about three minutes long. I just hope that you buy this app I think this is way better than angry birds or anything like that. if you do notnlike the movie you should still get this app anyway if you know what is good for you. I love it and I know that you will. I this game is so fun funny and most importantly awesome. so I hope you get it. ice age is kind of like the best game in the world oh wait it is! so his game is not only fun you will own the best app in the world. ok maybe it is not the best but you should still get it anyway. his os awesome I play it all the time and it does not have flashy lights in it so you will not have your eyes hurt. you can buy friends and fey movie theaters and much more! I want to talk to the manager to tell him how good of a game this is and that they should keep making more like this. works great on kindle fire bur am not sure on other syestems like an ipad or iphone. so get this app it is super fun you will not be dissipointed and the best part is that it is free! so I hope to see you playing this bye!
B007PTJOV0|3.0|I really enjoyed this game but after a while, ur rite, it does get a little boring. but it's ok to pass the time with. weird comments though. :O
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I haven't read Twilight or Hunger Games.  I tend to not like the current \\"fad\\" books.  I wanted to hate this book.  After reading people ripping it apart, as Twilight Fan Fiction, I REALLY wanted to hate it.  I read the description on here, and couldn't figure out the Twilight connection.  I decided to download the free trial.  I was hooked.  I had to buy it right away.  I read through all three books in 3 days.  The writing does switch, college creative writing to amazing.  But it was an easy read.  It kept my attention throughout, and I loved it.<br /><br />I finished last night and was left with this sense of missing.  Silly, I know.  I am embarrassed by how much I loved this book.  And not just the raunchy parts, though those were realllllly good, too.  But you connect to the characters.
B007AMMHSY|5.0|Great movie! Very different than anything else. Cinematography is excellent and vibrant colors are always there. I hope Almodovar will keep making movies for many years to come.

B004EPYZV2|1.0|Seriously bummed out that they won't be opening up the matte for the IMAX scenes, feels like Paramount really cheaped out with this disc.  I understand that it's more expensive to go through the work of creating discs like Tron:Legacy, Dark Knight, and Transformers 2 for BD release with IMAX incorporated, but with how hyped up some of the IMAX scenes in MIGP were I thought it would be a given.  I heard from his twitter comments that Brad Bird doesn't like to see a shift in aspect ratio for home video, but somebody at Paramount should have had veto power on this decision.  For me this is a dealbreaker, and I'm sure that I'm not the only one who won't be purchasing the disc because of this.  For now I'll have to Redbox it when I want to watch, and hopefully we will eventually see a better release.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|a lot of fake reviews...don't waste ur time by supporting this developer. waiting for Nintendo to have this taken down since it's low quality Mario copy.
0439023491|5.0|Now we know what happens to Katniss and  Peeta. Catching Fire is the exciting conclusion and they both face the hunger games again in an even better twist.<br />We get to see the reaction of Gale to the two \\"love birds\\" . What about District 12? All is revealed.<br />I thought this book was just as good as the first one.<br />Hunger Games was new and could slowly develop the plot and various relationships.<br />Catching fire expands on those relationships and gives us another hunger games as the 75th anniversary of district 13's defeat brings exciting new twists and turns.<br /><br />Sam Hendricks, author Fantasy Football Guidebook and Fantasy Baseball for Beginners

B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's live. Hard to keep up wit the coins but you jus gotta keep playin the games you already beat
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow,could not put this book down. Read it almost straight threw in a few hours. definitely a page turner. Only bought it initially to see what all the hub bub was about, needless to say I have read the first, second, and third.  Hoping for more of Mr. Fifty Shades. Love story was basic but quickly grows on you as Mr. Grey and his complex personality and life story evolve. Yes,the steamy erotica was explicit and more than jaw dropping at times but I equally enjoyed the history and details concerning our fifty Shades and what made him who he is today.
0439023513|5.0|I would have to say that the first two books are the best and the third is slightly less but then again how could you keep up the intensity of the first two books.<br />Mockingjay gets 4 stars versus 5 because Collins attempts to recreate a third arena for Katniss but it turns into more of obstacle course then an arena. The various maiming and killing \\"pods\\" seem out of place in a world where the electricity sometimes goes off and TV broadcasts can be sabotaged. All in all I enjoyed the interplay between characters, and the ending satisfied all of my curiosity.<br /><br />A thoroughly enjoyable trilogy.<br /><br />Sam Hendricks, author Fantasy Football Guidebook and Fantasy Baseball for Beginners
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I love this accessory.  I use it with my Baby Jogger City Mini 2011 Stroller.  I decided to purchase this stroller cup holder over others because it had more space for my everything (keys, cell phone, recipes, personal items, money, pacifiers.)  Plus it had two cup holders that are hold every size cup.  From a water bottle, a can of soda to fountain soda cups sizes and whatever.  I haven't found a cup that doesn't fit.  I'm never afraid that I am going to spill anything; although, it does happen.  We live in the real world but its because of user error.  If I don't take the first couple sips of something in, say a Starbucks cup, then there will be slight splashing.  But I always have wipes on hand because of the capacity.<br /><br />I'm serious when I say I love this cup holder.  I spent $10 on it when I bought my stroller as a paranoid, had to have everything, first time mom.  And I have to say its my best purchase.  I have used this product for 16 months and I never have had a problem with it.  It works great.  There is no damage to it and I use my stroller a lot.  It fits well on my stroller.  Awesome product!
B00701QVVY|4.0|I think this album greatly differs from its predecessors. Electric Age is a very fast and pummeling album none the less! Not nearly as epic as Ironbound, but still delivers a distinct sound that seperates this album from others in its genre. Be it the lightning assault from the guitar work or the unmistakable screams from lead singer, Electric Age has a new and crisp sound that should leave longtime fans very satisfied with Overkill's 16th album. My personal favorites on this album are... well all of them really! Come and Get It and Electric Rattlesnake are definitely the standout songs but on Wish You Were Dead the bass lines are very hypnotic and the final song Good Night starts very mellow and rises up like a fire and is a great song to finish off another awesome album!!!
B0055SWM08|4.0|This game makes you think through the puzzles.  The proper solution is not always what you think it will be.  Great exercise for your brain.
0439023521|5.0|Having read many of the reviews here and elsewhere (both favorable and unfavorable) I decided to read this book before seeing the movie adaptation. Set in the U.S of the future after a breakdown in society by war, famine and more wars, there exists 12 districts that are basically slave states supporting a populace living in the Capital who have everything. Elsewhere the people struggle to survive with limited supplies. In order to remind the districts how powerful the Capital really is, Hunger Games or a reality TV , real life survivor contest is held annually. A teenage boy and girl chosen from each district (24 total contestants) battle it out in a large arena that can consist of varying terrain, weapons and food sources. Only one can win! Our heroine is a tough girl who breaks the rules to keep her family alive in normal circumstances. She volunteers to play in the games so that her younger sister will not have to go. She is a martyr. She owes the boy from her district who kept her alive because he loves her. This is a love story with a \\"Lord of the Flies\\" type macabre social commentary on TV and power gone amok. Yes there is violence as the contestants must fight and kill each other. But the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad. For the most part it is a love story with more of the answers in the next and final books.<br /><br />I loved it. Could not put it down. Read this in one weekend and rushed out to get the next book. A must read!<br /><br />Sam Hendricks, author Fantasy Football Guidebook and Fantasy Baseball for Beginners
B000MU4EGY|5.0|For many people (myself, included), \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" remains a quintessential Beatles film experience which perfectly captures the spirit and essence of The Beatles in 1964. When United Artists released the soundtrack album from the film, it became an instant classic and sold in the millions. It remained a stellar catalogue item in the United Artists record division through the summer of 1980. Altogether, there were a total of 34 different label variations of the record issued, more than any of the Capitol, Vee-Jay or Apple label releases. They included two white label promo discs, two black label Capitol Record Club versions, seven High Fidelity MONO labels, four High Fidelity Stereo labels, four pink-and-orange labels featuring a different logo, four black-and-orange labels with a slightly modified logo, eight tan labels sporting another new logo and three variations featuring an orange and yellow image of sunrays cutting through a cloud-filled sky. On August 1st, 1980, Capitol acquired the rights to rerelease this classic album. The label issued it in three versions of the purple label and a reissue of the label's classic 60s dome logo with a rainbow circular outer-band with a black background. In its initial release, the album spent a total of 14 straight weeks at the number one position on the Billboard Pop Album Charts, longer than any other Beatles LP. This feat would be surpassed three years later when \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" would top the charts for 15 weeks in 1967. However, it is this original United Artists album that holds a very special place for any and/or all Beatles fans that remember the excitement generated by this unique LP release. The music contained in this album represent a very special chapter in the history of popular music and in mid-60s pop culture, showcasing 8 Beatles recordings and 4 instrumental arrangements by the George Martin orchestra. Both the film and album brilliantly personify \\"Beatlemania\\" in America in 1964. No other Beatles album before or after generated as much excitement and enthusiasm as did \\"A Hard Day's Night\\". And, just like its British counterpart which included 13 Beatles songs, this marked the only time in which all of the songs for one Beatles album were composed entirely by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The songs are a perfect example of what the lads from Liverpool could accomplish: the title song \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", complete with its unique stinging guitar-note intro; \\"I Should Have Known Better\\", with its prominent harmonica throughout the track; \\"If I Fell\\", which has superb two-part harmonies from John and Paul; \\"And I Love Her\\", one of Paul's best ballads; \\"I'll Cry Instead\\" a song written for the movie but not featured in the film; \\"Tell Me Why\\", undoubtedly the highlight of the television concert sequence; \\"I'm Happy Just To Dance With You\\" which has a fine lead vocal from George Harrison; and \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\", excellently featured twice in the film. Altogether, \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" remains the definitive Beatles cinematic experience and the United Artists album remains as fresh and exuberant nearly 50 years later.64.

B006AZZPCM|5.0|I downloaded this app few times. You could download videos, even parts movie edit together convert make own movies to dvd not from app but after using these files can hook them up convert on PC. After 6 months my phone software was unfixable. My phone when making a call between connection and 5 minutes would show battery dead and shutoff. After awhile few months later couldnt make a call period. It is a sneaky app it hurts your phone slow then when unchamgeable messes up your software. On the real theres no way around it just because you dont see it soon creeps up slow and takes over. I have a lot of experience with this app and I know very much how apps can take over.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|Most realistic war movie ever! My wife enjoyed this movie even though she usually doesn't like this genre. There is no doubt this move is the real deal when it comes to live ammo being used during filming. A person that is familiar with the sound of real gun fire will notice the difference between this and other Hollywood type movies. Highly recommended.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Looking forward to reading the rest of this book. Great points in this book and everyone should read it. Great price.
B0012CH350|4.0|It protects your grill very well. I just bought it so it isn't as easy to put on or take off as I expected. There are elastic straps at the bottom to help keep the cover tight to the grill. Other than the elastic, its a good product.

B004J4WNL2|3.0|Quiet:  The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain is a compelling read that is difficult to put down, but in the end it is a disappointing book.  Quiet offers a soothing place of solace for introverts attempting to cope with the realities of workplace structures that are increasingly characterized by their extroverted underpinnings. The book is largely premised on the author's review and interpretation of existing research, but it is also sprinkled with pleasant anecdotes and a small sample of personal interviews.  The topic matter is well researched with the findings presented in a highly accessible manner.  As a result, most like-minded introverts will find Quiet to be an easy, gentle, and reassuring read.<br /><br />While there are enticing components to Cain's book, it should not be construed as a self-help book as it has limited practical value.  For introverts, reading this book will not change the realities of their daily lives.  But it does serve as a reminder to introverts that it is very important for them to take regular breaks from socially noisy environments and make space for self-rejuvenation.  For the (cherished few) open-minded supervisors, human resource personnel, managers, and business owners who have the temerity to look beyond current views of preferred employee personality profiles, reading this book will supply them with a worthwhile alternative perspective.  In these respects, Quiet is an important book.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Cain's book does have significant shortcomings that are best expressed in terms of what it does not do.  Quiet is presented in an emotionally regulated fashion with an overriding avoidance of the raw emotional aspects of introversion.  Perhaps this emotionally regulated approach to the book is a reflection of Cain's personal interaction style.  But, the author's quiet approach to overriding attitudes towards introverts within the workplace is of particular concern.  The author, who is also a former lawyer, fails to let her readers know that it is unacceptable for introverts to be overlooked, excluded, disregarded, and devalued on the premise of their personality profile.  Cain expresses admiration for the quiet Rosa Parks who softly but firmly said \\"no\\" to being treated differently by a bus driver whose conduct was premised solely on the basis of her race.  Yet Cain, herself, lacked the courage to say \\"no\\" to being denied the same opportunities that extroverted personalities enjoy.  Instead, she abandoned her law career in favour of the quiet pursuit of writing.  She even recommends that introverts take similar steps to remove themselves from workplace environments that are wrong for them and enter ventures that are more suited for the introverted personality type.  Contrary to Cain's premise, not all introverts can or should strive to start their own businesses or make a transition into another occupation solely in order to control the amount of social stimulation they encounter.  This is unrealistic, impractical, and unwise.<br /><br />The reality remains that introverts are frequently overlooked as suitable job candidates.  Yet, Cain fails to take a stand let on behalf of all her introverted readers.  The commonplace Western preference for extroverted job candidates and the selection of same through interview questions that are designed to weed out applicants with introverted personality types, smacks of exclusionary practices.  Employers that claim to be \\"equal opportunity employers\\" but simultaneously rely on personality profiling as part of their candidate screening process are merely paying lip service to such claims.  Yet the author makes no mention of this and consequently neglects to address the ramifications of reduced employment opportunities to introverts.<br /><br />Problematically, Cain also restricts her book to a narrow demographic of the introverted profile.  Little attention is divested in the realities of single introverted (young) adults and even less to mature single adults.  Furthermore, the unacknowledged and untold voice of introverted seniors in Quiet is of particular concern.<br /><br />The author unfortunately examines the introverted personality profile through a restricted lens.  Cain merely touches upon the subject of \\"bitter introverts\\" (l. 896) - the troubled souls that have repeatedly experienced the ramifications of their introversion straight on.  Being overlooked and undervalued because of one's disposition can over time take a serious toll on the individual:  something that \\"bitter introverts\\" know all too well.  There is an element of avoidance on Cain's part to address the defiant side of introverts who suffer deeply from living in a dismissive society.<br /><br />The outcome of Cain's emotionally controlled soft approach to the topic of introversion is a lost opportunity to create meaningful change for the realities that introverts - who do not have the luxury of wrapping themselves in a socially protected bubble - presently endure.  For such introverts the ramifications of possessing such a personality type continue to be passed over, devalued, and disrespected.  Creating a publication worthy book is an achievement.  But, in this instance, Quiet is a disappointment not for what it accomplishes, but for what it does not.
1400032717|5.0|This is a gem of a book. The insight into the mind of an autistic (Asberger?) mind is amazing. That is the main appeal of this book for me. The description of what it was like for the main character to step into a field for the first time and take note of a hundred different things that most of us fail to notice because we don't concentrate made me understand that autism is simply a different form of intelligence. I had so much more understanding of the difficulties parents of autistic children face after reading this book.<br /><br />All of characters in this book are very believable, which is a breath of fresh air for me, but I was touched by the boy's parents who were completely fallible. As much as the father wanted to do right with his son, he got fed up with him at times and even lashed out at him. The consequences are tough but it's so believable. I SO get the mother who abandoned her family because she just didn't know how to deal with her son. It's not admirable but these people are real.

B006UTJ6DM|5.0|I just bought this and love it. I had the original soundtrack, and lost it. I decided after seeing the movie in 3D I wanted to own the soundtrack. The songs are simple. The music reflects the mood of the movie. The CD that is songs from the era, it put the time in perspective. Well worth the money.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|This review is for the whole series as it is virtually impossible to differentiate. I read this because it's become such a cultural phenomenon. I had been aware of it as a fan fiction ever since reading Twilight several years ago and never had an interest in reading it. I think the series is interesting as a cultural phenomenon more than a book. This is the book that will sell more e-book readers than any other and it is fascinating what this series' popularity says about women but that is not a book review.<br /><br />There are many things throughout the series that are just annoying. The repetition! The entire series is a slight rewrite of one scene. The conversations in and out of the bedroom are repeated over and over and OVER. I cringed ever time I saw the words \\"inner goddess\\". The sex scenes show why talking during the act just shouldn't be. Drooling over your husband's body like a hormone addled teenager every time you see him half clothed is boring. Secondly the plot points, well the few that there are, could have all been stolen from whatever soap opera the writer happened to flip on on tv. No originality. In addition many of the plot points are simply not feasible. Christian buying and gifting a publishing company to his just graduated from university wife? Really? This man is the head of a multi-billion dollar company with a business acumen par none? Ana has virtually no knowledge of technology and has no email and she wants to get into publishing? Talk about severely unqualified. Finally, Christian, in one long passage at the end of the series, expertly explains his psychoses and their origins.  He had been withholding this all along as being simply too painful but seeing Ana in mortal danger and a quick meeting with the woman who was his dom, just leads to him spilling everything in clinical detail as if he is now a psychiatrist. Too simple.<br /><br />I know Ana is essentially Bella Swan and as such we shouldn't expect much of a character but her pettiness, for someone who is supposed to be special, reduces her once again to a teenager.Ana reads texts on Christian's phone, flies into jealous rages over and over and it's not interesting. She may have more of a back bone and a little more character development than Bella, but I don't see what Christian found so fascinating about her. She tripped and fell in his office and he knew he had to get to know her. Really? Like Bella and Edward, Ana and Christian discuss little other than how messed up he is and how much they lust and then love each other. I would argue that I can get the attraction between Bella and Edward better than Ana/Christian. I can understand why Ana is initially attracted to Christian but I don't understand why she falls in love with him.<br /><br />Finally the reason everybody is talking about this series: sex. At first it is hot and titillating but by the third book I was mostly skipping over the repetitive and all to frequent escapades. It  will probably improve some women's fantasy lives or inject some excitement into their relationships. The sex isn't as scandalous as one may be led to believe in reviews, but it is different enough to distinguish it from your average bodice-heaver.<br /><br />Bottom line, as bad as the writing and repetition are, I did want to see what happened next. I get why the book is appealing. It deals with several well-known female fantasies: changing and reforming a very bad boy, being swept off your feet, finding unconditional love, the ugly duckling getting the beautiful swan. Christian is vaguely fascinating. However, I think the main reason, after the surreptitious e-book availability, is that people are indulging their Edward and/or Robert Pattinson fantasies. Many of us had such fantasies upon reading Twilight. EJ James simply wrote hers down.
B005OK721G|5.0|The most striking thing about \\"Colombiana\\" is not the action but it's intelligence.  It contains a story that's thought provoking and characters that are neither buffoons or cartoon figures.  It's heartening to know that the antagonists and the much maligned feds in action movies are not idiots.  This ratchets up the tension of the narrative immeasurably.  This film works on all cylinders.  Taut script, crisp editing, and gangbuster direction by Olivier Megaton(\\"Taken\\").  If Zoe Saldana isn't a household name after her tour-de-force work in this film there is no justice.  She expertly juggles the physical and emotional demands the film calls for.  Behind the cool veneer of her hired assassin lies a vulnerable sensitivity.  This not only makes her character more intriguing but makes her more desirable.  Produced by Luc Besson this stands with his previous masterwork \\"Leon-The Professional\\".  In a genre full of wannabes \\"Colombiana\\" rises to the top.

0439023513|4.0|The final installment in Suzanne Collins' \\"Hunger Games\\" trilogy is even darker than the first two.  Having survived two Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen has become the inspirational symbol for the rebellion.  But this isn't a role that she necessarily embraces:  while she hates President Snow and his Capital regime, she is also appropriately uneasy with the District 13 leaders who are directing the rebellion.  The refrain from John Cage's Song Book--\\"The best form of government is no government at all\\"--seems apt in post-Quarter Quell Panem.<br /><br />The book is extremely  violent, and the violence is much more personal than that in the first two in the series, for several reason.  First, the violence impacts characters we have come to know well.  Second, here the violent acts often have protracted, lingering effects, most centrally with Peeta, whose ability to distinguish reality is greatly diminished by the tracker-jacker hijacking of his brain.  Finally, where the violence in \\"Hunger Games\\" and \\"Catching Fire\\" largely take place in the setting of the games, which, at least at some level one can dismiss as implausible, in \\"Mockingjay\\" the violence is violence of war.  Yes, it's war involving futuristic, science-fiction weapons, but it's war nonetheless, and war is real.  Moreover, the confusion of war, and notably, Katniss' difficulty in determining who is ultimately responsible for each violent, awful action, is convincing and profoundly disturbing.<br /><br />In places Collins works too hard to explain herself, reminding the reader that this is a young adult novel.  But in general, one gets lost in her carefully constructed world, and emerges spent.  It's a powerful ending to a surprisingly good set of novels.
0525478817|5.0|I was reluctant to read this book despite its glowing reviews everywhere. I just didn't think I could deal with the subject matter of teens dying of cancer. However, if you think this, you are missing out on one of the most beautiful, touching stories about hope and the human spirit I have read. It really is hard to find the right words to praise this book.<br /><br />First, let's talk about characters. The two main characters, Gus and Hazel, are two of the most memorable I have ever read. Yes they may be a touch too clever, but they have spirits. Gus maybe does seem too good to be true but I can forgive it. His search for metaphor in life is unique and his joie de vivre is inspiring. Hazel accepts her fate in life but doesn't let it get her down. Even the secondary characters are all intelligent, funny and real. You know these people.<br /><br />I won't spoil the big surprise in the book, but you will think you know what the end will bring but you don't. That twist is heart-breaking and the reason you will shed many a tear. I like that we don't have a final ending for all the characters, but there is no need for a sequel.<br /><br />This book could have been horribly melodramatic but Green's writing elevates the book to the level of literary classic I believe. I hope one non-explicit sex scene doesn't make it highly banned in high schools but I fear it will. There would be so much to be discussed and mined in high school or college courses.<br /><br />I read this book in about 4 hours because I just had to know what happened, but now I will go back and read it slowly to get all the nuances and enjoy the brilliant writing. This book put me on a John Green orgy and I can only saw the man is brilliant. I can't wait to read any book he publishes in the future.

1439152799|1.0|I loved Kate Morton's The Forgotten Garden, and liked The House at Riverton, and so was looking forward to her latest.  It arrived this morning, a gloomy Saturday, perfect for getting lost in a good book.  But, alas, this book so did not live up to Morton's earlier works that all I can say is, it was a total waste of a wonderful reading day.<br /><br />The blurb on the inside cover sounded like a wonderful story; a letter delivered to her mother 50 years too late (lost in a mailman's bag in an attic all that time) sends Edie on a search for some unknown secret in her mother's past.  The search leads her to a castle in the English countryside, inhabited by three elderly, spinster sisters, whose father also happened to be the author of a famous children's classic.<br /><br />The book got off to a pretty good start - the first 5 or so pages, that is.  But the story stalled, bogged down in tedious details.  For instance the author took two whole pages just to describe how one of the sisters realized she was getting elderly because she lost her balance while trying to put her nylons on.  The author went on and on, spinning words on mind-numbing details that did nothing to move the story forward, and in fact had nothing to do with the story at all (do we really need to know that Saffy kept pet chickens?).  And the underlying plot of the story itself soon began to feel very forced and contrived.  Raymond Blythe -- father of the sisters in the castle -- was the author of a famous children's classic never out of print for 50 years called The True History of the Mud Man, which is about some sort of monster man who arises out of the mud and consumes anyone who looks at him.  Sounds like some corny comic book story, not a revered classic.  Really, couldn't Morton come up with anything better than that?!  And this book was supposedly such a piece of great literature that it changed Edie's life from the moment she first read it; I can't imagine how, and the author never enlightens us.<br /><br />I made it about half-way through and then realized this book was a serious waste of my time.  I skimmed the last half of the book -- enough to find out what happened (nothing, really) without having to wade through all the silliness.  Really, this book is a huge disappointment, especially given that Morton demonstrated so capably with The Forgotten Garden that she really can write.  She did have a good idea here, the whole mystery surrounding what really happened at the castle in 1941 plus the tensions of Edie's relationship with her own parents.  However, she should've slashed about half of the manuscript and started over.  Of her three books this is by far Morton's worst and it is such a waste of valuable reading time that I really can't recommend it.  Thank goodness I got it through a book swap and so didn't waste any of my money on it!s us.<br /><br />I made it about half-way through and then realized this book was a serious waste of my time.

Unfortunately, the series producer, Wilma Fine, has a soft spot for Antal Dorati, one of the most inept conductors of the century.

B0001Z53MY|4.0|This has always been (by far) my favorite EJ album. It is a diverse rock album that absolutely rocks you to the core, cuts to the bone and yet has its tender moments and delicate melodies. I consider this to be the band's high point, with all the right ingredients in place; an excellent, experienced singer/songwriter team writing impactful lyrics and soaring melodies. An awesome rhythm section featuring the limber Nigel Olson at the drum kit (I played drums in my youth & always wanted to sound like him) and the late, great Dee Murray on Bass guitar. Relative newcomer Davey Johnstone articulates loudly and delicately on Electric Guitar. What can I say about this dvd-a? The main thing I noticed is the elimination of the annoying 'tape hiss' that plagued the viynl, the pre-recorded tape and even the 1995 issue of the compact disc. So sonically it is a major improvement. The drums & bass are clean & punchy in the .1 track. One thing I was was a little less then awed by was the AC3(Dolby Digital)only sound track. Oh, it is good, but is somewhat compressed. Another dvd-a I own has an alternative DTS(Digital Theater Sound) soundtrack which I think most highly of. I think all dvd-a's should have alternative soundtracks. Unfortunatley, the bonus tracks bring me no joy as they had been issued on an earlier re-mastered CD. So over all I like this dvd-a very well. If you are an EJ fan you should own this dvd-a. It is their finest classic album and this dvd-a sounds great.

B004A8ZWVK|4.0|It's during the JFK Presidency and there are talks of civil rights by Martin Luther King but things haven't changed much for the black folks in Jackson, Mississippi and you can see the great division between them and the whites: separate hospitals, different neighborhoods, other parts of the bus and even the female maids, who take care of the little white children, are told to use a different bathroom because it is believed they carry diseases different from the white folk. It's pretty unsettling to see something that was taken as the norm and yet only happened quite recently in our history. A progressive white woman (Emma Stone) decides to get the maids to open up and talk about what it's like and after a lot of resistance (because they could easily be killed or beaten by white supremacists) they begin to share the injustices of their jobs as well as their little victory/revenge moments (which are recorded anonymously). Some of the white wives treat their maids as you would expect: some are nice, most follow the societal norm and a minority are just plain out manipulative and cruel. Octavia Spenser, who would pick up Best Supporting Actress from the Academy Awards, plays the smart mouthed Minny Jackson who gets that special moment with the pie. The cruel white girl ringleader had a mother she forces into a rest home. Until I saw the credits I didn't realize that was Sissy Spacek. Allison Janney (from the \\"West Wing\\") plays the mother of the main character. The budget for this picture was $45M and it has so far made over $206M (Wiki). The Academy Awards additionally nominated this film for Best Actress and Best Picture. It is based on a novel of a similar title by Kathryn Stockett. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; RACISM FOCUSES:  B plus; SETTING/ERA: B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: mid April 2012.
0060574216|1.0|I read this book as an impressionable teenager and came to the conclusion that I must be a man. I then walked around for years thinking that I'm somehow unfeminine because I don't shop for therapeutic relief and I don't gaggle in groups. Conversely, men who enjoy open dialogue are unmasculine. I've even heard some friends admit to assuming a young man was gay because he communicated well with women. If all men were introverts and all women were extroverts then this book would have received a two star rating from me.

B0078Q2HAA|1.0|UPDATE - April 8, 2013:  I just wanted to take a moment to remember the real Margaret Thatcher, who died today.  She was a great lady and I do hope that her strength, integrity and huge contributions to history will be remembered truthfully and fairly.<br /><br />I so agree with what Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said regarding the senate resolution honoring Lady Thatcher, \\"Let me just say that Margaret was one of the most influential and revolutionary figures of the 20th century, and failing to name her achievements would do her memory and her legacy a great disservice. It would be unheard of to commemorate Churchill for example and ignore his heroic role in steering his countrymen through the battle of Britain, nor would we think of honoring Lincoln without mentioning the Civil War,\\" McConnell said. He added: \\"Let's acknowledge the enormity of what she accomplished. Let's mention her achievements by name and the resolution does that because we owe her a tribute equal to her legacy.\\"<br /><br />Truer words were never spoken, and this sentiment very aptly applies to the movie THE IRON LADY. May she Rest In Peace.  ~Linda~<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW - April 15, 2012:  I cannot understand what they were thinking!  An opportunity to make a movie about one of the MOST FASCINATING AND INFLUENTIAL WOMEN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY.  The greatest actress of our generation playing the lead.  And this opportunity is squandered on a ditzy, artsy-fartsy script that examines the whole thing through the fictional fantasy lens of and elderly Margaret Thatcher's demented flashbacks - as if anyone actually knows what is really going on in the mind of a person with dementia.  What a waste.<br /><br />It started out OK.  A lot of movies detailing the lives of great people start out in the first 10 minutes showing the main character in advanced old age and the main story is told in a long flashback.  This kind of plot device was done very well in the movie \\"Chariots of Fire\\".  I don't mind knowing that Margaret Thatcher is suffering from dementia - it is a fact and is not out of place in a story about her life.  But the problem with \\"The Iron Lady\\" is that the story got stuck in the advanced old age segment and about 45 minutes into the movie, I realized that the makers of this bomb had no intention of examining the MAIN STORY at all.  The WHOLE thing was about a lonely, demented old woman whose glory days have passed her by and now she is of no importance.  I found myself heaving an involuntary sigh of exasperation when I was subjected to yet another imaginary conversation held in the \\"fictional\\" Mrs. Thatcher's hallucination world.  What little factual and historically relevant information they included was hazy and spotty. The flow of the script is so disjointed that no sensible understanding of Margaret Thatcher's incredible life, accomplishments, family, or career can be gleaned from this self indulgent mess.  The people involved in making this boring, pointless movie should be ashamed.  I was expecting so much because it could have been great but was sorely disappointed.<br /><br />A flick about an elderly woman suffering from dementia should have been saved for an arthouse fiction about dementia, not imposed on a life story of someone of this magnitude.  Really, what could have been the motive for obsuring Margaret Thatcher's enormous contributions to the twentieth century?  Could it be that the makers of this flick hated her and her politics and wanted to diminish and marginalize her but didn't have the courage to do it in an honest and up front fashion?  That is the only thing I can figure out because this movie makes absolutely no sense at all.  At best, it is a tawdry invasion of Mrs. Thatcher's and her family's privacy as she faces a slow and difficult death.  Perhaps it is a fact that she is struggling with dementia, but the writers of this script are not privy to the details of how that is being played out and have been forced to fictionalize it to an absurd degree in order to have a story that leaves out who she really is.  To magnify this small aspect of her life while brushing aside the bulk of her life's work is almost criminal.<br /><br />There are only three good things that I have to say about this movie.  First, the make up artist did an exceptional job of making Meryl Streep look extremely elderly.  Most of the time, old age make up is sloppy and not believable, but I have to say that Ms. Streep really did look realisticly old in this movie.  The second thing is that Meryl Streep did a great job of acting, as usual.  It is a pity that she has no better judgement than to lend her great talent to a substandard production like this one.  I have always had some respect for Ms. Streep, but after watching this movie, I have lost some of my former good opinion of her. The third thing was that the movie finally ended and I never have to see it again.<br /><br />I will never get back the time and money I wasted watching this stupid show, but I can spare just a few extra minutes to warn you that this is a waste of time for anyone who wishes to actually know anything about Margaret Thatcher and her real life.  Those facts are documented for anyone to see and no story teller needs to descend into outrageous liscence to make a movie with something worthwhile to say.  If you want to make a moive about dementia, then make a movie about dementia.  If you want to make a movie about Margaret Thatcher, then please, PLEASE make a true one.ced to fictionalize it to an absurd degree in order to have a story that leaves out who she really is.

B000G8NXZK|5.0|I'm inspired to write this review after reading \\"Slick Jimmy's\\" review.<br /><br />Let's get something out of the way first and foremost:  We're never all going to agree on what's a good movie.<br /><br />I think the bottom line is whether or not a movie speaks to us as individuals.  Next, does the movie speak the truth?  Does it accurately reflect our realities and does it enlighten us to what we need to hear?<br /><br />I saw \\"Brazil\\" at a time when I worked for the government and was in love with the Goddess of my dreams, whom I pursued even thought she was engaged to another.  It was a romantic time for me, and this film reflected a lot of what I was going through.  So, yes, I could relate to it.  On top of all that, I thought it was incredibly well produced, well cast, and funny as hell!  :-)  I loved this movie.<br /><br />Some have called it depressing but Sam Lowry led, in a way, a charmed life.  Okay, so it ends in death (perhaps?), but what about all the adventurous stuff that happened along the way?  Meeting, and making love to, the girl of his dreams?  Becoming the super hero that he'd been dreaming about?  That's pretty cool stuff!  In a way, all of his dreams came true--but perhaps the final one, though, he had to revert back to his (waking) dream world.  Shades of \\"The Matrix\\"?<br /><br />Also, has anyone noticed how rare it is to find a movie that accurately predicts the future?  I can find no better cinematic prognostication than \\"Brazil\\"!!!!!!<br /><br />Terry Gilliam successfully predicted the Internet; watching it at work, and the ever growing influence of terrorism, and government control out of fear, in our everyday lives.<br /><br />In hindsight, I know of no other movie that forecast our modern times more clearly.<br /><br />This movie was Gilliam's masterwork, by far my favorite Gilliam film.  I hope he still has a few more masterpieces in him.
B00722ZIBA|5.0|Well....they've done it again! Another CD with as much funk, soul & jazz that could ever be imagined on one CD. Everytime i hear them it's like being in a time warp. Back in the day comes right back! I don't believe there is anyone else out there rockin' it like this. I have all of their music from \\"Jazz Funk\\" to this one. They keep progressing further into greatness with each release. My personal favorites are The Way You Love (which has an unbelieveable bass line), The Less You Know, Thoughtful Fantasies, Above The Night and Goodbye To Yesterday. I was still grooving hard to their previous CD \\"Transatlantic RPM\\" when they sprung this one out, now i just put them all on the CD player and \\"run and duck!\\" Back to back funk, jazz, R&B all day long!! All the vocals, horns & rhythm arrangements are straight out of the 70's. Bluey is amazing. I'm also partial to keyboard player Matt Cooper whom i'm familiar with from his group \\"Outside.\\" He was always a favorite of mine and i feel he enhances their already fantastic sound. I'm so incredibly grateful to these musicans for putting out music of this caliber, when everyone else is caught up in the mess that's dominating these times we're living in today. The whole CD is great.........BACK IN THE DAY..is \\"BACK\\"
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I absolutely loved season 7 just as much as the earlier ones.  I am like the others. I am hoping they bring back Bobby - miss him lots - he was their irascible father figure and I think they just keep getting better.  Cannot wait for more great episodes from them.  I wish they were my brothers.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|ICO is art in motion and Shadow of the Colossus has to be one of the most incredible video games to date. It is a gamer's responsibility to play these at least once.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is one of the best game ever if you don't have this game then you just need to /
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book enabled me to understand the journey from death to healing.It inspired me to look beyond all the stories on death & suffering. It made me feel hopeful that there is some kind of life afterwards. I was truly happy i read this book.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is great game for free on the appstore i would definitly recommend getting this. Works great on my kindle fire and brings back my memories of playing mario on the gameboy years ago except he's a leprachan . Totally recommend if you like Mario.
B001NZEHMS|4.0|\\"Licensed to Ill\\", the Beastie Boys' record setting album with the hits \\"No Sleep 'til Brooklyn\\" and \\"Sabotage\\" opens the ears and eyes of many listeners to a unique sound of rap and rock, though the artists would never have allowed themselves to be categorized as such.<br />This album opened doors for new-age thinking along the lines of rap music, and the fusion of rock to birth an era of heavy lyrics and sharp-toned sounds emphasizing the emotions of musicians toward their local and national government, and still spinning a funny theme of irony in their music videos that followed. \\"Licensed to Ill\\" is a necessity to music enthusiasts and likely a paramount album for many early '90s-influenced musicians.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is very cute. I like it and my daughter likes it. loved the movies and this game does them justice.
0439023491|5.0|I liked this book the best of the three in the Hunger Game trilogy. It was action packed and there were many surprises, especially the last line, which made me want to start book three as soon as I finished book two. As an adult, I found this to be as interesting to me as it was for my middle school students.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|despite many other reviews;If I lose my lives I can restart the level.I don't have to restart the whole game.there are so many haters just because the game resembles Mario.that is what is so awesome about it! most people are prob just jealous they didn't make this cool app.I woulda paid for it but they were great enough to make it free.love it.
B005MYEQ4U|1.0|Oh God! It was so boring.  I expected much more out of this movie.  I love Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams.  It was too long and far fetched and just a bad story that could have been a lot better.  If you want a good nap, rent it and watch it.
B007SSEBCU|2.0|This was poorly produce movie. The producer obvious intent was to make her look as bad as possible. They focused on the end of her life instead of the time she was in office. The political intent was obvious.
B00729Z6R4|5.0|Swedish melodic rock sensation \\"H.E.A.T\\" are back with their third album \\"Address the Nation\\". \\"Address the Nation\\" is the first album to feature Erik Gronwall as the new lead singer of \\"H.E.A.T\\" replacing Ronnie Lekremo amongst the established line up of Eric Rivers (g), Dave Dalone (g), Jona Tee (k), Jimmy Jay (b) and Crash (d).<br /><br />In terms of artistic direction, \\"Address the Nation\\" holds few surprises for those experienced in the style of \\"H.E.A.T\\". Form day one the six-piece delivered first class `80s-oriented melodic rock that would look up to the recent works of seasoned super-stars of the scene. So there is no such thing as improving their creative formula, simply delivering more of the same great melodic music. Twin guitar melodies, lavish rhythm section, majestic keyboard harmonies and flamboyant vibrato-based vocals are constant elements in \\"H.E.A.T\\"s playbook.<br /><br />  The anthemic opening \\"Breaking the Silence\\" is followed by \\"Living on the Run\\" a song in the style of previous \\"H.E.A.T\\" tunes as \\"Stay\\" and \\"Never let Go\\" - then comes the mega-protestant \\"Falling Down\\" where performance intensity peaks, never forgetting the \\"Europe\\"-esque \\"Better off Alone\\".<br /><br />From there the album takes a turn towards a more subtle adult-oriented style with such songs as the playful \\"Need her\\" and the unsurpassable \\"In and out of trouble\\" where Erik uncovers a great deal of his class as a performer.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Scandinavian rock or AOR, melodic rock and hard rock of any kind, you should definitely try \\"H.E.A.T\\"s third album. If you have experienced their previous releases, you do not need any recommendation, chances are you have ordered it already!
1439190275|1.0|I didn't even realize this book wasn't written by Dr. Atkins until it arrived... then I figured the author had simply updated the original Atkins info to current information and products available, etc.  So I read it.  This is a wannabe Atkins book, basically just another low carb diet book.  This book actually says to watch fat and calories, which is NOT something the original Atkins diet is all about.  I can't believe this book is allowed to use the word Atkins in it's title - it is NOT true Atkins.  If you're looking for the original, tried and true Atkins diet, definitely get the Dr. Atkins New Diet Revolution (Revised Edition) book.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|This is a great game to kill a few minutes of time. It's a match 3 game, with an interesting twist.
0345803485|1.0|I expected A LOT more from Fifty Shades of Grey, considering the success and hype of the series. At best, this is harlequin \\"romance\\" about a silly undergrad and the powerful, handsome (and beyond stereotypical) Mr. Grey. At worst, it is an amateur-ish, poorly written, and dare I say it: BORING \\"coming of age\\" tale that belongs in a drugstore's bargain bin.<br /><br />Think 'Twilight': gorgeous, mysterious guy rescues pure girl then encourages her NOT to fall for him while simultaneously stalking/harassing her. And of course, she is so infatuated (who wouldn't love this self-absorbed jerk wad?) that she ultimately transforms herself to be whatever he wants... vampire or sex slave, depending on what you're reading. I predicted every plot twist, didn't care about the characters, and ended up skimming until the end. I definitely won't bother with book 2 and 3... are Kindle readers REALLY that desperate for something to read?! I'm fifty shades of grey for spending $9 on this lame piece of chicklit.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book. It is impossible to put down.  It is a book you feel guilty reading but can't stop!,,
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this game. its fun to play. and it gives a little challenge. i would play this game more than any other game.

B0000844M8|5.0|I watched this movie all the time when I was a young girl and loved it.  I wanted to watch it with my 8 year old daughter who loves animals too.  She loved it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|So great!  Could not stop reading. Love all the characters and the different relationships developing.  So happy I have a kindle and didn't have to wait a minute before ending the first and starting this one. You will love it!  Can't wait to read the third. Omg
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is like Mario with a little green Mario and its definerly a great app I would recommend to everyone
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I downloaded this book four days ago, and read it at every available moment. Quite simply this is the best book I've read in a while and I look forward to the next one.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is really fun and challenging. You can get stuck playing it for a really long time.  The music helps relax you too.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The first 2 books go into extensive detail about everything. This last book felt rushed. I loved it but it left me wanting more. I wanted the details I was use to. Days weeks months years rushed. Should have been 4 books. Still loved it. Reading it a second time to try to put some of the pieces together
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it one new thing after another just makes you wanting to keep playing!! the graphics are great and you still get to hunt like the original!!!
0741470314|5.0|As a fan of Michael Jackson for 38 years, I was eager to read Defending A King ~ His Life & Legacy.  Dr. Moriarty defends Michael Jackson in a strong and credible way, explaining his decision-making, lifestyle, and unique challenges.  I now see from a fresh perspective the paradox of his life, and understand some of the disconnects that I have  wondered about.  I have more respect for MJ than ever now, after reading some of the very personal bullying, attacks and challenges he endured throughout his life. I respect that he had the strength to focused on his music, his family and in trying to make the world a better place, while going through these challenges. Thank you Michael for being the man you are, and thank you Dr. Moriarty for giving us a behind the scenes of his life!! This book is a vindication and a celebration of Michael Jackson.  Very welcomed!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this App. More accurate than the news weather... Helps me get dressed for the day. Lets me know the weather throughout the day and the week. Great App.
1591844096|5.0|I wasn't impressed by the \\"Linchpin\\" concept, it seems a bit of a stretched analogy.  However a little later in the book it begins to appear that Seth Godin simply used that as a framework to hang a lot of big ideas on.  I started turning down page corners like mad and kept it up through the rest of the book.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is fun,  but kind of hard. My 8-yr/old daughter loves this game!! It certainly takes some practice,  and the leprechaun is cute.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a intrigueing game for my son and I. we both can play and stay busy for hours. anything that will keep him happy makes me happy.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Why do you have to have wifi to update its a pain. But I love the game and so does my family. Get rid of the having to use wifi to update.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|great game...totally addicted ...only draw back is u need to use real money to buy certain thin or g...bogus!!! or would get 5 stars
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I cannot get past the &quot;checking for updates&quot; screen either. I am connected to the Internet but for some reason it isn't locating it.  very disappointed after reading all the great reviews.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|What a disappointment<br />I have finished the Hunger Games trilogy and come away wondering if the third book was ghost written or pushed through with no editing advice.<br />After developing plot and characters for two books it is as if the author lost steam and got tired of her creations, therefore, since its war, she just killed them all off.  It was like literary extinction; the author has taken this character as far as it can go....poof, you're dead.  Here is what I didn't like:<br />Too many character's built and woven into Katniss' life are so easily expendable<br />Plutarch remains such an ambiguous character, likeable, greedy, unlikeable, scheming, self serving and yet he is the one who remains<br />Too many plot devices stumble to nothingness.<br />The pearl<br />Friendship with Joanna<br />Effie (abducted/tortured/back and counting time/gone)<br />Coin?????????<br />The whole lost my mind thing........seriously?  how about \\"I don't know how much time has passed but this is what happened in my insanity\\"..................and explain more<br />Build up the friendship/mentorship with Finnick to chop it all off?  He deserved better since the reader invested in him and Annie<br />Gale's family another expendable plot device<br />As I reflect, the only character true to themselves and therefore one I can invest is Haymich.  He was and remains just a drunk.  He comes out of his alcohol cloud for a few brief moments of clarity and brilliance, but he returns to stupor again and again<br />I began to wonder if I hadn't paid attention.  The beauty of a kindle is you can search for specific words.  So Mockinjay ends with this beautiful statement about dandelions.  I used the kindle to search and there is no mention of dandelions in catching fire and 4 mentions of them in Hunger Games.  A plot device should flow through the story so the reader can further connect to the characters and events, not just random hodge podge thoughts.<br />There is also this allusion to herfather but I don't feel it is ever flushed out completely as a believeable thought, its more of an afterthought, oh yeah, I miss my father, oh yeah, this connects me to my father.<br />I guess the message of the whole trilogy is if I become a scrapbooker all my problems will be over.  Hope Katniss waits for the sale at Hobby Lobby, card stock can get expensive.
0307341550|5.0|I don't read very often, but received a kindle for Christmas this year. This was the first book I bought and I couldn't put it down. Flynn's witty and sarcastic writing style is fun and captivating. I look forward to reading more from her.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is fun like Tiny Village. So if you like this game try out Tiny Village also. But overall its pretty fun.
1400097029|3.0|Exquisitely written novel: I savoured such descriptions as 'the iron gate...rust has reduced its struts to a tremulous filigree.'<br />The narrator slips between three time frames- the present, staying in a seaside guest house in the village where he spent his childhood summers; the recent past, living with his wife through her terminal illness.<br />And the distant past and the summer when he met the exciting Grace family- glamorous parents and their 11 year old twins...<br />Keep on reading; right up to the end you think nothing much is going on, but the twist comes right at the end.<br />I can't say it's one of those books that will remain with me- it was hard to really engage with any of the characters- but Banville's poetic prose is quite out of this world.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My 5 year old is obsessed with this game she loved the movie and thinks this game is awesome and its very easy for her to play good job with this one its a winner
B0063IH60K|5.0|All you could want in a free solitare! you can even customize bkgnd and cards! would recommend to all that love this classic game.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this app. it is super fun. my kids love it also. works well with the kindle fire. good job
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I found this book to be a great ending to an amazing trilogy. I must admit I was nervous to read this book at first since I snuck a peek at a few reviews on here beforehand. I had a bad experience with the last book in the Eragon series and ever since I've been nervous about getting into another series. I loved this last book though and I'm glad I read it. Sure, I cried at a few spots but the book was very true to the characters and world she created.
B006QS0PF0|5.0|A well written frank and brutally honest memoir.A must read for anyone suffering from eating disorders and struggling to come in terms with their own sexuality.I liked her style of writing.I admire her for being a wonderful person both inside and out.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game so cool.The cool part is that there's no waiting. So five stars to this game all the way!
B004I11VZ0|5.0|This movie is awesome! Has a lots of fights, action, and the scrip is very good. Donnie Yen is very smooth and quick, love this movie.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Set in a post apocalyptic world ruled by a controlling governing body in the Capitol, kids are forced to fight to the death in an arena each year. In book 2 of this trilogy it's more of the same from book 1, and that's not a good thing.<br />The author seems to think that the entire universe revolves around these games. That somehow all the people in the Capitol live only for these games and all the people in the district spend the entire year worrying about the next ones. The characters are 1 dimensional with the only one really being developed at all is Katniss. Unfortunately she is a terrible hero; annoying, whiny, oblivious and filled with ridiculous contradictions. She's paralyzed by her emotions and only succeeds at anything because of those around her.  I found that I felt frustrated throughout the book, hoping for something to happen, anything and when it finally did in the last few pages it was idiotic along with Katniss's reaction to it. Even the games themselves, an opportunity to really show some creativity and human emotion, are completely wasted as an artistic writing opportunity.<br />While her writing style is actually pretty good, the story line is all over the map and doesn't come together cohesively or even moderatey believable. District 12 mines coal (for what?) and does absolutely nothing else while at the same time the Capitol has invisible hovercrafts and a wide variety of forcefields, terraforming capabilities, etc? Despite all the problems it's still an decent read and I will slog through the 3rd one. I'm only 5 pages into it but somehow Katniss is even more of a pathetic basketcase already (please let that change...)
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I really likle this game . it is a fun platformer that can test you skills .it is like Mario but better
0439023521|4.0|I read all three of these books. I thought the first two were really good but the third was a little slow for me. I have not read any of the other books that people have compared this to so I don't know how similar it is to those. The writing is definitely aimed at the young adult crowd. It reminded me a little of Twilight. I though it was a good story and the author did a good job with character development.
0345803485|2.0|I really don't like writing bad reviews. I admire people who have the courage to put pen to paper and expose themselves to the whole world, especially those writing erotica. Having just finished this book, however, I feel compelled to write a review.<br /><br />About half way through the book, I looked up the author to see if she was a teenager. I really did because the characters are out of a 16 year old's fantasy. The main male character is a billionaire (not a millionaire but a billionaire) who speaks fluent French, is basically a concert level pianist, is a fully trained pilot, is athletic, drop dead gorgeous, tall, built perfectly with an enormous penis, and the best lover on the planet. In addition, he's not only self made but is using his money to combat world hunger. Oh yeah, and all of this at the ripe old age of 26! And on top of that, he's never working. Every second is spent having sex or texting and emailing the female character. His billions seem to have just come about by magic. It seriously feels like 2 teenage girls got together and decided to create their \\"dream man\\" and came up with Christian Grey.<br /><br />Then come the sex scenes. The first one is tolerable but as she goes on, they become so unbelievable that it becomes more laughable than erotic. She orgasms at the drop of a hat. He says her name and she orgasms. He simply touches her and she orgasms.  It seems that she's climaxing on every page.<br /><br />Then there's the writing. If you take out the parts where the female character is blushing or chewing her lips, the book will be down to about 50 pages. Almost on every single page, there is a whole section devoted to her blushing, chewing her lips or wondering \\"Jeez\\" about something or another. Then there's the use of \\"shades of\\". He's \\"fifty shades of @#$%% up,\\" \\"she turned 7 shades of crimson,\\" \\"he's ten shades of x,y, and z.\\" Seriously?<br /><br />The writing is just not up to par, the characters are unbelievable, and the sex verges on the comical. I don't know what happens in the remaining books and I do not intend to read them to find out. But given the maturity level of the first book, I imagine that they get married, have 2 perfect children, cure world hunger, and live happily ever after while riding into the sunset, as the female character climaxes on her horse causing her to chew her bottom lip and blush fifty shades of crimson. Jeez!the comical. I don't know what happens in the remaining books and I do not intend to read them to find out. But given the maturity level of the first book, I imagine that they get married, have 2 perfect children, cure world hunger, and live happily ever after while riding into the sunset, as the female character climaxes on her horse causing her to chew her bottom lip and blush fifty shades of crimson. Jeez!
B007MLDC2I|2.0|Loved the movie, it was as everyone has described.  BUT, I ordered the HD....which was not as clear and crisp as expected, so I will never order HD from Amazon again.  ADDITIONALLY, I was charged a different price than what was advertised.  I am giving 2 star because the movie was good, but will not order via amazon.com again for a movie rental.  The rest of amazon has never disappointed me, but this service blows.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Well there are a lot of pros and cons well I think that the only big con is that you can't go back to the home page but it can be solved by pressing the  option button  and then the home button will show up.
0743496736|5.0|The thing I like about Jodi Picoult (usually) is that she is very good at making me see both sides of the story. I started this book, of course, with little/no sympathy for the shooter. After reading the book, I was able to see things from him point of view and I had more understanding. Not that I condone it any way but it made me realize that things aren't always what they seem in the beginning. This book provoked great discussion with my sister and brought up a lot of good questions. I definitely recommend it.
B000025IOE|5.0|Santana achieved their prime period from 1969 all the way to the end of 1971. This period is identified by the first three studio albums, of which this is the third. The Latin feel is deeper  in this album than in the two previous ones, but still is an excellent blend of rock, African and Latin moves. This album is very enjoyable and of a high quality output. Santana is one of those bands that were liked by a large variety of social groups.. and still is. They were a great revelation at Woodstock and one of my favourite classic rock bands along with Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, etc. (all at their prime period of course). I am alone in this world, Ain't Got Nobody. I love you guys and God bless you so much.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this game is perfect for killing time. the load is fast and the games are challenging. on my kindle it looks really clear. great free app.
0307719219|1.0|In addition to the many wrong facts mentioned in several other reviews I just want to point out one almost rdiculous mistake: there is a map of Europe in the 18th century  supposed to show the spread of serfdom in Europe at that time. This map  shows Europe as it exists today - with countries such as the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany in the borders  after 1990 etc., plain stupid in the context. This makes me wonder: if they can't even get that right, what about the rest? The whole thing is badly researched, highly speculative and single-mined. Social scientists should at least get the historic facts right when they try to make a splash launching an \\"earth-shaking\\" theory - or stay away from it. Even Isaac Asimov's \\"socio-history\\" in his \\"Foundation\\" trilogy was better founded - and at least he represented it as what it was: science fiction. This book appears to be mostly fiction with pretty poor science...
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My daughter and I played this together for the longest time! The graphics are awesome and the script made us giggle. A lot of fun for young and &quot;kind of &quot; old!
0385342063|5.0|I loved this like I loved the Bridget Jones Diary books and movies with Renée Zellweger! I wish they would also make this into a movie starring Renée Zellweger! It would be wonderful!

1589946634|5.0|First of all, I have never played the Warhammer 40K table top game. I'd like to, but the price of the minitures and the time that needs to be put into assembling and painting them has kept me away. I am a big fan of the PC games and novels set in this universe, so that is my experiance with WH40K. The gameplay is pretty fast paced and tense once you get the hang of the rules. In solo play you control 3 teams of 2 space marines. Each team has 3 action cards: attack, support, and move + activate, in which one action can be used each turn, but the same action cannot be used 2 turns in a row by the same team. Genestealers are spawned each turn by event cards each turn and the battle system is pretty basic, attack range is determined by the space marine card and then you roll a 6 sided die (numbered 0-5, 1-3 has a skull symbol) and get a skull, then the genestealer is dead. When the monsters attack the power is determined by how many of them are in a swarm, or on the same position. A die roll equal to or less than the numbers of genestealers in the swarm kills the space marine, unless he has a support token, in which the attack can be re-rolled. The purpose of the game is to travel to different locations and to meet the objective of each one. The location cards also have different terrain cards that determine where the genestealers spawn. I got this game a few days ago and have played through three solo games. The first game I didn't have a complete grasp of the rules so I got slaughtered pretty quick. I looked up video demos on youtube and my second game went more smoothly, but I still lost but made it to the final location. The third game I managed to win, mostly because of a condition on the final location card. This game is a great combination of strategy and luck, because you need both to win.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the entire series, couldn't put any of them down.  I would like to see more books continuing the series.

B004LOMB2Q|3.0|I'd much rather be using Note Everything because it is what I've used for yrs &amp; yrs now. I've heard some things about Evernote that I don't feel good about but I guess time will tell? I have found some things I don't like in the short time I've had it. Like the fact that it says I can't see my notes offline without using a paid version. I'm not sure I want to keep it yet so I don't want to pay 45$ and find I hate it. If I'm unable to view my notes offline I really don't see the point. As for the things I DO like... I LOVE the lists feature.
B005COO1X6|3.0|i was surprised that the story ended at 80%.  i was left unsatisfied.  not a typical king ending.  left me wanting more.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I came across this movie by accident in my local video store, didn't know anything about its background, but was wonderfully surprised by the excellent story line and honesty of the plot. I now have publicised it to lots of friends who also rented it and they too are telling others about it. I have now bought all the other movies by Sherwood Productions and have been equally impressed  by the quality and the encouraging message that they tell, hopefully there is more to come for us to watch and enjoy.
0307592731|5.0|Like Siddartha, who left behind all that he knew and loved, who left behind all that comforted him in order to gain insight, Cheryl Strayed walked into the wilderness with only an outlandishly heavy pack on her back, carrying everything she believed she would need to sustain her in between pit stops on the Pacific Coast Trail. She even left her old name behind and carried with her instead her new name: Strayed.<br /><br />Wild is Strayed's nonfiction account of her journey, as she made her way up California and through Oregon, seeking not only enlightenment but also solace. Without ever saying it explicitly, what Strayed needed was a respite from the unrelenting grief she felt over the loss her mother five years before her journey began.<br /><br />And while there was no big revelatory moment in which Strayed realizes what losing her mother means to her, what there is is a serious of little deaths and drifting aways, as Strayed peals away the layers of her grief and builds a newer, thicker skin to cover her original skin, worn raw by her own attempts to medicate herself through self-loathing.<br /><br />What Strayed did on her journey up the PCT was remarkable for anyone, let alone a young woman unarmed and alone. But what she has done with Wild is even more remarkable; indeed, she has shared a narrative in which we all see ourselves, laid bare and bleating. Out of Strayed's hardships, she shows us our own footsteps forward. With her, we cross the bridge and find ourselves stronger for having traveled with her.<br /><br />There was much that I personally identified with in this narrative, but I suspect that so many who read it, find that as well. Strayed captures with heartbreaking perfection what it is to lose your mother when all your life you felt your biggest job was to keep her alive, and what you learn in letting go of that overwhelming grief is how to mother yourself.<br /><br />Strayed does not take it easy on her readers. She will make you cry. In fact, I did not simply weep silently into a tissues as I read; I sobbed. Loudly. I finished the book just this morning on a packed bus to New York and actually had to lock myself into the bathroom so that no one would hear me as I sobbed. She will also make you laugh. She will entertain you and teach you things. In the end, you will awe and relief at her survival. You will be changed.<br /><br />Wild is a gift to us all. I hope you will read it.

B00628RVV0|5.0|This really was a very well-done film. However, it was extraordinarily depressing. That is how it should be, though; we are talking about the Holocaust. You really can't pretty it up, and you ought not to try. I read all the reviews before watching the film, which made the film less suspenseful, and not as dramatic. To get the full effect of the film (which I greatly advise), DO NOT continue reading. Spoilers, well, spoil the film a bit.<br />-------------------<br />SPOILER ALERT<br />----------------------------------<br />I'm not sure that the film is entirely possible. I doubt this ever actually happened, though I suppose it might have. But the story has a big impact. It touches on divisions between members of the family, and conflicts between German soldiers. It reminds the viewer that not all of Germany thought that what happened during the Holocaust was good, or even right. Then again, it also shows the viewer that the opposition did not have much of a voice. The government would quickly squash down any discontent. It also focuses a small amount on propoganda that was being fed to the German population, reminding them that the Jews were evil and responsible for the state of the nation (making the patriots happy), and cast a happy life on the 'work camps', painting them as lovely places with nice food, and sports (keeping the bleeding-heart critics happy). I think it was nice to include the real picture, as it gave credibility to the film. The German population really did have a real clue as to the horrors that went on in the camps right away. Once they realized, there was little anyone could do. The government control had grown too strong, and the people bowed beneath that control.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|It has been awhile since I read this,but it puts into words what I know in my heart, that we ourselves are in charge of our lives and our purpose in life, and that relying on a faith in something that does not exist is actually weak. What a wonderful world it would be if people realized that the good they have in them is self-based and not based on a belief that has been created out of fear of the unknown.

B006R1T40I|5.0|Back in the 70's I started developing a taste for bourbon. I had tried a number of them, but none held a candle to Old Ezra. The bottle advertised 15 year old, 101 proof, so I figured it was worth a try. One taste and I was sold.<br />I loved letting my bourbon-drinking friends sample it. They all agreed that this was special. I most enjoyed sharing it with my dad; he'd come over for a visit and I'd offer him a sip. He never asked for it; I'm sure he believed that it was just too good to demand. But he was always pleased when it was offered.<br />How do you define great? There are tons of other bourbons out there, but this one just had it all - the smoke, the sweetness, the punch, the smoothness, the feeling that the alchemy was just right as it was being made. A touch on the tongue and a story unfolded, one with deepness, and meaning, and truth.<br />I found out a couple of years later that there was no more. I search three states and found two cases sitting in a distributor warehouse. I secured both of them and stayed happy. The company came out with other bourbons that used the same name, but they were never close to the original (most were 7 year old).The decades went by and I had my Old Ezra 15 year old only on special occasions. There were other bourbons I found that were acceptable, but I guarded my stash of the best.<br />I lost my dad a couple of years ago. By that time I was down to the final ounces of Old Ezra. I poured my final shot glass and drank to a man, and a time, that will never come again. Old Lang Syne is a cliché to all but those who know those moments.<br />A new Bonnie Raitt record is like finding another bottle of Old Ezra. There's the smoke, the sweetness, the punch, the smoothness, the alchemy that has been there all these years, decade after decade. Thanks for finding the Slipstream, Bonnie.
B002RVCD0U|1.0|Well, there's nothing like destroying a franchise, is there? Take two of science fiction and Hollywood's most beloved movies, remove everything that was ever good about them and flush them down the toilet - and Jim Cameron's not even dead yet. I love - LOVE - the originals and it pains me to watch my adoptive children get the George Lucas treatment. Let me count the ways in which this film will be remembered as one of the bedrock events in the destruction of storytelling and a critical step towards Michael Bay receiving the Nobel Peace prize and Best Screenplay Oscar in 2020.<br /><br />I knew from the beginning it didn't look good from having a director called McG - Mr T was the last three-lettered celebrity I can remember but at least he didn't try to direct a film. When Helena Bonham Carter showed up as the stereotyped terminal cancer patient, I knew we were in trouble. And then Sam Worthington showed up (the Gene Hackman of our times, appearing in about 10% of all films currently being made) and couldn't decide on an American or Australian accent for the duration of the shoot. Fortunately, it's not too noticeable since Christian Bale's Batman growl steals the show.<br /><br />If you can cast your mind back to the legitimate Terminator films, one of the rules is that bullets don't tend to do much damage to Terminators whereas molten steel is a pretty effective way in taking one out. In this film, it's the reverse - Christian Bale takes out a T-800 with a machine gun but fails to destroy one with molten steel. Go figure. And that's the most faithful this film gets to the originals.<br /><br />Then there's a whole bunch of new characters introduced that nobody cares about and they attempt to recycle some of the iconic dialog (\\"Come with me if you want to live,\\" to which the only response is \\"If the rest of the film is this bad, I'll stay here.\\")<br /><br />Back to the bad and broken logic, Skynet is no longer trying to exterminate people but rather farm them for some reason that doesn't make any sense. It turns out that Sam Worthington is 50% Terminator too but by the time we find out, it's no surprise because we saw it in the trailer. More of a surprise is the massive Transformers-style bot that's incredibly bad at catching people. And then there's the even bigger surprise of the motorcycle-shaped Terminator that takes a USB Flash drive - thank God the USB2.0 protocol survived the war.<br /><br />At some point Bryce Dallas Howard shows up, thankful that she's in something marginally better than Lady in the Water. Apparently, Claire Danes is still recovering from embarrassing herself in Terminator 3 and couldn't bring herself to this horror show. I don't really remember why she's there.<br /><br />Anyway, plot-wise we get into some really convoluted plan by the machines that makes the average episode of Murder She Wrote look like Agatha Christie. They build this half-human-slash-cyborg thing to lure out John Connor when the real thing was infinitely more effective (or they could have just killed his father when they held him in the farm). Skynet is apparently running Windows ME since their strategic logic wouldn't win a chess game let alone Future War.<br /><br />The ending - slight SPOILER ALERT here - is so far-fetched I had to rewatch a Christopher Nolan film to bring back my faith in the movie industry. There's a heart transplant surgery that would make a daytime soap opera blush and literally I was ready to head out for a beer when it happened.<br /><br />So sorry for the rant but the first Terminator films are largely responsible for my love of movies and McG just did the worst possible job. Terminator 3 was possible to ignore but Terminator Salvation leaves my brain rocking back and forth in my head trying to make sense of the whole thing. As far as I'm concerned, this story ended perfectly when Arnold was lowered into the molten steel and that's the end of it.<br /><br />If you remember how thrilled you were when first seeing Terminator 2, do yourself a favor and relive that film rather than having it trashed by this one. And I didn't even get to tell you how bad the pointless CGI Arnie looked but apparently it cost a *lot* of money.t seeing Terminator 2, do yourself a favor and relive that film rather than having it trashed by this one. And I didn't even get to tell you how bad the pointless CGI Arnie looked but apparently it cost a *lot* of money.

1933633867|4.0|If you think being in debt is something we invented in our modern time which for many people consists of spending money they don't have on things they don't need, guess again. In his book Debt: The First 5.000 Years David Graeber presents a both fascinating and informative study on what debt is. What might be a bit surprising to some is how this isn't a dry survey based on economics and finances, but instead an approach which was immediately to my liking. It is already evident from the title, that the author offers a historical perspective, but he also takes the anthropological route.<br />It needs time, and many pages, to write a concise survey on a topic like this, and the book does not disappoint in that regard. Unraveling the workings behind what it means to be a debtor and creditor in the broadest sense, along with many colorful examples, this part is deeply interesting, but unfortunately also really long winded. This first half of the book, which concentrates on what debt actually is, how we relate to possessions, and the author's concept of human economies, could have used some streamlining in my opinion. The second part, focuses on the global history of debt and offers a balanced view, broaching the topics of financial systems and economic order, and finishes with a thought-provoking conclusion, \\"What is debt, anyway? A debt is just the perversion of a promise.\\"<br />In short: Debt through the eyes of an anthropologist!<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the NetGalley book review program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.

B004EPZ070|2.0|Sunday afternoon coming down after a nice, long, relaxing week away from work and I decide to veg in front of \\"Something Borrowed,\\" a formulaic romcom I stumbled upon. Two best friends who also both harbor secret, as-yet unrequited love for each other dragged me around for longer than was necessary and all I wanted was someone to get some cojones. Ginnifer Goodwin and Colin Egglesfield play the lovers with plenty of unconvincing looks of wanting and feet of clay. The third wheel is Kate Hudson, who once again plays a cliched materialistic party girl (hey, her mom made a career of playing stock characters, so why not?) and John Krasinkski is fairly wasted as the long-suffering best friend. Now, let the games begin.<br /><br />As I referenced earlier, it's nearly two hours and far too long to dangle the will-she/he or won't she/he carrot on the stick in front of the audience. Furthermore, it leaves some loose ends that should've either never been introduced or better resolved. Lastly, it gives us few if any characters to truly care about. No one is honest with themselves or the objects of their desire, and the longer it goes on the less we care about anyone.<br /><br />I'm sure plenty will enjoy it but I found it a hole that sucked the remains of my weekend. Hopefully, there's still some time to save it. Let's see what else is on...

B003BVK36Q|4.0|I've been reading Le Carre since \\"A Murder of Quality,\\" and \\"A Most Wanted Man is one of his best. I have to laugh at those who get their knickers in a twist, as the Brits would say, over claims that this novel is somehow anti-American. The book takes note of those who only see things in black and white, incapable of seeing nuance, subtlety, shades or grey or more than one side of an issue. Such people, only able to think in the most simplistic terms, should not be making policy or be heads of government agencies (or political leaders). Showing the policy of extraordinary rendition for what it is is not being anti-American. There are many Americans who oppose such a policy and do not succumb jingoistic notions of patriotism.
0545405777|5.0|This book was very interesting! From reading mainly paranormal romances then reading this, I was blown away! I actually felt like I was a character in the book watching the whole thing play out. Just mindblown!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This isn't a book that will make you laugh and smile or warm your heart. It's definitely dark and depressing. It will move you though. There is a lot of gore, and the author hasn't held back on the honesty of the brutality of war. I realize that eventually this book will be made into a movie for teens, and I'm trying to work out in my head how they will keep the PG-13 rating without altering the story drastically.<br /><br />I can't give it four stars as I did with the other two, because the story is simply depressing. At least in the first two novels, there were moments that made me smile. This one is definitely lacking that. I'm glad that I did read it, but even though I purchased this book, I can't say I will ever read it again. I was really depressed after I finished it.<br /><br />There's a definite lack of Peeta here. I don't wanna give away any spoilers why, but this particular installment focuses much more on Katniss' relationship with Gale. I'm very sad to add that a very key character does get killed off, and after this happened towards the end of the book, I had to ask myself what the point of all of Katniss' suffering was. Honestly, if that particular person had not died, I probably would've given it four stars.<br /><br />I have to admit that the Epilogue was satisfying. There is--in a way--a happy ending here. More bittersweet, I'd say. I don't understand why so many people were so unhappy with the Epilogue. I think it's safe to say that any human being would not get over being put through so much devastation to have their life go completely back to normal. And despite what one reviewer said, good definitely triumphs over evil in this book.<br /><br />This book was honest and haunting. I still think about it and the meaning a lot.
B004QBWU02|5.0|Funny. Nostalgic.  I remember when. Great start for those now very famous and talented stars, i.e. Harrison Ford, Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard etc. Love to watch again and again. I collect movies-have over 500 dvds. Welcomed it to my collection.

B003Y5H5HO|3.0|Apparently, Sony is the culprit in screenprinting the DVD to look like a bootlegged copy.  I have changed my rating from one star to 3 stars.  According to emails received from the seller, this is a known issue and they have contacted their attorney about this issue.  I'm updating to 3 stars but no more, as the seller should have included a note with each purchase to explain this as a known issue to save themselves and customers some time in issuing a bad review and then having to amend it.

B0059XTTW8|4.0|I didn't read the book, so perhaps that is why I thought this movie was so much better than some reviewers. Despite that observation, the cast and acting alone made this film worthwhile. You do have to pay attention, as the story unfolds from the present telling of who the \\"mole\\" in British intelligence might be, to scenes from the past. This past and present telling, completes the entire picture connecting the characters, and their part in the story. The movie itself takes place in the cold war of the 70's. The premise is the mission to discover the identity of the Russian spy, who has infiltrated the highest circle of the English \\"spy\\" community, known as  \\"The Circus\\". I never  thought the movie slow or boring, and anticipated learning who the Russian spy was, or if the spy would even be found out. The final minutes of the film, showing scenes from a past party, interspersed with scenes of how finding the spy among them had affected their lives, was emotional and poignant. This is a movie worth seeing to judge for yourself.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game.  Keeps me busy when I'm bored. Plus I'm a huge fan of Oregon Trail Def reccomend this app.
B000ICXQII|4.0|I loved seeing Debbie Harry in a movie role although her acting was a bit unsteady.<br />This takes being addicted to television to a whole new level.  Watching this particular new show called Videodrome of non stop torture plants a tumor in your brain which causes some very sick fantasies.<br />This movie made me question my own life long television viewing.  What would life be like without any television?  Hasn't it taken over our brains just like the people in this movie?<br />This didn't rise to the level of five stars for me but it certainly gets four stars due to it's poignant theme and the way it made me look anew at what too much television can do to us.  For anyone who loves sci-fi this is a must see.

B000ZBUY78|5.0|The picture depicts a darker face than what the actual item looks like (which makes it look even better). One would have to get it professionally resized (I only had to spend $5 at a local jewelry store and they did it right away) because it does not have the standard pin. That quality also gives it a sleeker look! I wear mine every day so greatly appreciate the lack of changing out a battery. Days are in English and Spanish, plus they are not too large where it looks obnoxious. The only con is that I didn't get it sooner!

B0073XORCY|4.0|It's difficult for legacy acts to succeed with new material. So much of our appreciation of their seminal works is tied up in nostalgia. Thick as a Brick was the first Jethro Tull album I ever purchased and at the time I was 12 years old. I clearly didn't understand it as a spoof and regarded it as a very serious work of musical expression. It was a badge of honor to own and listen to a record that I thought was so superior to the music that my \\"less informed\\" classmates listened to. Forty years of experience have taught me that Thick as a Brick was a great rock record, but not Beethoven. Listening to Thick as a Brick 2 objectively, I find it to be another great rock record, but still not Beethoven. Just as the lyrics of Taab appealed to my sensibilities forty years ago, the lyrical content of Taab2 addresses issues that people my age think about. Unlike some naysayers, I think the new album is actually more cohesive musically and lyrically than its predecessor. I appreciate the many references to Tull past in the music, from Aqualung to TaaB to A to Dot Com. I miss Martin Barre, but think the musicians supporting this project acquit themselves admirable. This rhythm section actually grooves, which is something that seldom happened in Tull's esoteric past. Florian Opahle both brings to mind Barre and adds the freshness of his own voice and John O'Hara may be my favorite Tull keyboard player since John Evan. I think the album is well recorded and mixed and sonically is quite an improvement over TaaB. \\"A Change of Horses\\" might be the best song Anderson has written since the 1970s and the rocker \\"Kismet in Suburbia\\" shows that the locomotive still has breath.

0679746323|3.0|The sheer numbers of people who die on every third page of this book are astounding.  I am by no means disputing the facts as presented - in fact, I tend to believe them.  However, the picture it paints of Mao is so utterly psychopathic that it either lends a whole new perspective to the art of being a world leader, or explains a great deal about the state of modern world politics.
B00178JDCK|3.0|Just received this pedal and now I am considering a return. It sounds very good (possibly a little \\"digital\\") and I even kinda like the somewhat silly \\"space\\" mode which backs guitar sounds with a 1980's synth sound.<br /><br />So why send it back? Well, even though it is inexpensive and it sounds very fine, it is cheaply made and difficult to control. 100% plastic, including the little plastic pins that act as both a pivot for the footswitch and as little buttons that are pressed with a ball point pen to access the battery compartment. When, not if, those break, the pedal will be worthless.<br /><br />Also, the knob which controls the various reverb settings does not line up with with the wording on the housing--example: \\"space\\" mode is achieved by aiming the knob at \\"ducking.\\" This would be no big deal if the knob at least locked into its various settings whereby one could remember where to set it. Alas, no. It spins freely. Also, the wording is so small as to be illegible except upon close inspection under bright lighting. Good luck gigging with this pedal if there is more than one setting desired. I was having trouble just trying to control it in a dimly lit room at home. I really don't enjoy sitting around playing under 100 watt bulbs.<br /><br />I realize that I can get around these issues, but I'm thinking maybe those who enjoy this pedal might be better served by spending the extra money on the line 6 verbzilla--which is the pedal behringer is copying here.

Now a showdown is coming, and an innocent man and his, or what's left of his wife, are caught in the middle.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|the tungsten is is that the game is just like Mario which brings joy to me. some may think it sucks but I enjoy this game I just cant beat 4-3
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This cooler is very versatile, it basically fits every socket types other than LGA 2011. The mounting hardwares are strong and secure once they mounted. The instruction is very straight forward, but one thing to look out for is the position of spring loaded screws. First, you will have to know what socket you are mounting this on; second, look for the correct screw position because it is rather difficult to see.<br /><br />The heatsink is big, but resonablly sized. You will be fine if you are installing this in any mid-tower or larger. I tried to fit this heatsink in my dead microATX PC, it is several millimeter over the width of the case and the side panel will not fit. According to some reputable reviewers on youtube, the heat pipes in the heatsink contain tiny amount of liquid that repeatedly vaporizes and condenses to effectively cool your CPU. I would believe that and don't cut the heat pipe.<br /><br />The thermal paste application is going to be tricky because of the design of the base. The heat pipes will make direct contact with your CPU and there are tiny gaps between the base and the heat pipes. Normally spread method is fine, but on this one I would recommend the dot mehtod because the thermal paste may not be able to fill up the gaps if you are using the spread method.<br /><br />The fan this cooler come with is a high RPM, high air flow and loud fan; I use it a rear exhaut fan, then I put the original exhaust fan as a side panel fan. I use two Cooler Master 120mm Red LED Case Fan(Blue LED and no LED are the same fans) in push and pull configuration. These fans have slightly less air flow than the stock fan, but they are really quiet. The acoustics works out fine for me, and my case is the Cooler Master 690 Advanced II.<br /><br />I installed the cooler on my i7 2600k. One thing to keep in mind if you are using LGA 1155 CPU is that these CPU are very small, be cautious on how much thermal paste you are using, you dont want to have thermal paste in the socket. A good thing to do after installing the cooler is to run a CPU stress test such a prime95 for about 10 hours. This will ensure that your cooler and CPU have good thermal conductivity. And during the CPU test, the heat generated by the CPU will fill up the rest of the microscopic gap, and the pressure on the CPU by the heatsink will push out air bubbles.<br /><br />At the moment I finished the stress test, the max CPU temp on one of the core is 36C, the other 3 cores were lower. I didn't overclock at that moment, but you can see, it has good cooling capability for overclocking. The reason I have this great cooling performance may be that I have 3 exhaust fans near the cooler and creating negative air pressure. You will almost always have negative air pressure unless you have a full tower case. The heatsink is accumulating some dust. I recently install dust filtering mesh in all ventilation openings and close all unused PCI slot. I think it will work.
B007CGLRWA|5.0|I write this in shock and amazement at the film I just saw.  One of the most memorable pieces and one of those unforgettable expressions of art that leave a lingering imprint.  The acting of every single character was raised to their peak, which is not only a testament to the writer, director and actors, but the ever reaching voice of the subject matter itself.  In this film you will see a piece of yourself, and will be flooded with memories long forgotten.  Almost documentary merged with dramatic cinema and nothing short of amazing.  This is not a film you watch.  It is an experience.  I can not believe I just saw one of the best films I have every had the pleasure of seeing and it is a pre-theatrical release on Amazon.com. Oscar worth performance and dark horse for best film of 2012.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|I've never heard of the books but am a big Tommy Lee Jones fan and enjoyed this movie. Like all of Tommy Lee J's movies the issues at the heart of the drama are big life questions, with political overtones, and this character, like many of his others, has strong moral convictions and little tolerance for people who do wrong. The Robicheaux character is classic. Love the setting of the bayou, the swamps. that culture and the overhang of the misty murkiness of the atmosphere is brilliant, making everything appear as an illusion, a dream. Most of the really awful stuff happens off screen, the focus is more on the characters; the cast is excellent, Jones is so real and the solving of the crime isn't a cause for celebration, really, more like an opportunity for acceptance of reality as seen through Robicheaux's jaded, soulful eyes. Very entertaining.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great fun game addicting fun out. going funner then angery birds woo owowowowowow wow  wow wow wow wow wow wo
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This is my first ever review. I thought Me Before You was going to be predictable when I first started to read. Not long into the book, I couldn't put it down. I was really moved by the story line. The characters were very real and believable. I couldn't put the book down and haven't stopped thinking about it for a whole week! It has been a long time since I read a book which has moved me so much. I enjoyed it immensely.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This book brought me close to tears in a couple parts but definately a great story. The plot is so unique. I mean c'mon how often is there a guy-walks-hundreds-of-miles-to-meet-girl stories are there? Truely a work of art
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I came across this while looking for something to borrow for my prime membership this month.  I drifted away from scifi over the years as I hadn't taken to some of the newer authors.  Wool, however, has rekindled my love of scifi.  Don't pass this one by and you won't be sorry.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This simple, yet addicting game, is presented in a unique way that gives it a feeling that is much more than it is.  A steal for only a dollar.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I can't even get it to open.  It checks for updates and then tells me I'm not connected to the internet eventhough I am.  Then it gives me the option of quitting or retrying, which has the same results.  And I have plenty of storage left.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This trilogy is one of the best ive read in a long time. It's a must read for any woman.!!!!!
0439023513|5.0|When I started to read mocking - jay  I was really disappointed at the beginning - first, the sector 13 was not the most valuable start, especially after the unique book as \\"Catching fire\\", secondly Gale was not Peeta and yes, this Gale was not only arrogant and aggressive but also very powerful hater in many ways as well as Katniss. As you can expected I do not like this characters move. But from the middle the story become more and more deep and dark, also really catching the interest with the distant relationships between Peeta and Katniss, the powerful angst of Gale going deeper and deeper and even the president Snow share his role as a villain with someone else. The final book is just fine, amazing, the whole saga is even better than Harry Potter and in many way (probably all ) is better love story the stupid Twilight, this of course on the top layer. Finally, I can say that I am really pleased from the final chapter and a little bit sick that the series is finished. But new book, new knowledge...
B004VRL4BM|1.0|This is the same as the second half of volume 3. and it is not for use in the US. when I plugged it in it shut down my player
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Reading it just makes me feel even better then I was feeling just love hearing about the father load or great
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is awsome i love it. it is challenging and fun, it makes my mind work more. Quell is cool.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|it might be 3$ and only 2 maps,but since it has the coming soon, I know that it's going to hacker a update and get more levels. so I'm happy about that so I gave this game a 5/5.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is worth all ninety nine pennies. I love it and apparently everyone else  does too.  What are you waiting for?
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I don't know why you would rate this 1 star, this game and the first Gangstar are very good and the only reason that it takes up so much space is to put in all of the greatness into the game
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I have installed numerous other Android games on my N2A-enabled Nook Tablet that all work fine, but this game says it is incompatible and would not run.  I rebooted back to my native Nook OS and downloaded the game from the B&N App Store. That version works fine.  This was my first time with this kind of game. The graphics are beautiful and HD.  It is a bit short but still fun.  I bought their other game, The Secret of Grisly Manor.  It is equally beautiful, and much longer. I am about halfway through it.  I recommend both games.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Sure, this game feels like any of 100 console performers, but there is nothing wrong with that. You rarely find a game that runs well and plays this much like a console game on android. A classic formula that is well implemented.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|This program lets me do what I need to do. I put it on my Droid too. Good little tool.
B002IFT1ZA|1.0|I ordered these DVDs. The show is great but 2 of the DVDs arrived with gunk all over them and were not playable.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I am really enjoying this game!! It is very fun, additive, and cute!! I cant seem to be able to put it down...
B0002BO0HG|5.0|This album his a huge triumph for Antony and the Johnsons. The emotion and angst is on the very surface of this album. The song \\"Rapture\\" is, of all the songs the band has ever released, the one that better displays all Antony and the Johnsons qualities: The incredible vocals the deep cutting melodies and the heart-on-the-sleeve emotions. This album is also the one the withstand repeated listens and gets better every time. This will be very hard to top.
B007TNS6JI|1.0|this installment is nothing like DH2 for the Kindle Fire... this is an \\"arena-wave\\" hack/slash... not a dungeon crawler like Diablo... you can level up; however I don't see the point... you can allocate your Stat or skill points but i would love to have the dungeon crawler gameplay that DH is known for back... don't be fooled by the name... this version is not the same RPG you enjoyed.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|I downloaded this app because the preloaded app would not receive all of my new mail. So I uninstall it and reinstalled it and got the same results. Also when I delete meg's and then check on my comp it was still there. Not withe hotmail app. Its perfectly synced with your hotmail account when you delete mail it will reflect that on your comp. Perfect!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Just a warning: I downloaded this book for my 13 year old daughter based on the title which is very similar to a popular young adult book called BETWEEN SHADES OF GREY. Hah! Not the same. Needless to say, she was pretty creeped out by 50 Shades of Grey.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|i figured it woud be a good mario substitute and its perfect for just that. im glad its free that makes it the perfect game
0375869026|5.0|I loved this book. It made me laugh. It made me cry.  It made me think.  It made me happy, sad, angry - all in one book.  What more can you want in one single book?<br /><br />Auggie (August) Pullman was born with SEVERE genetic facial and cranial deformities.  Because of the many, many (did I say many) surgeries he had as a child, his mother homeschooled him and he had never attended public school.<br /><br />But then the day comes when his parents apply to Beecher Preparatory School and Auggie is accepted to attend.  And he decides he will try it out, even knowing very well what the other children's responses are going to be - and most probably all the adults too.<br /><br />I loved the courage of this small boy. I wanted to know Auggie by the end of this book.  And Summer, the girl that immediately befriended him and sat with him at lunch. I liked the way the situation with Jack was handled, even though I cried along with Auggie.  I liked Mr. Tushman, the director of the school.  I hated the ignorant bullies.  And I loved the ending.<br /><br />This is an exceptionally well-written book about a boy with outer deformities, a bright brain, and a huge heart.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|most people say that they think that the last book fell short but i dont think it coul have gotten any better. i thought the way she wrote it and how they all have gone through so much and still sticked together was amazing. people say that catching fire was their favorite but i think that mockingjay out did them all.
B0032W2QUU|5.0|Absolutely a must see for any BSG Fan and worth the whole...we did this without PiXar being invented yet? whoa...<br />The storyline is still a standard for any one sick and tired of politcal pundits bs so its a nice escape but for some reason...I think my toaster just winked at me...
068817776X|5.0|As much as I love to read it is getting harder and harder for me to find a book that is just hard to put down which is disappointing. This book was spotted on the grocery store discount rack so I just grabbed it for something new to read and am I glad I did! Fabulous read especially for those interested in history.
0345803485|1.0|I cannot believe this book is on the NY Times Best Seller list!  The trilogy follows the typical recipe for romance, but I was surprised and dismayed at the number of sexual scenes compared to character development.  The trilogy reads much more like erotica or trashy romance than anything with substance or wit.<br /><br />While at times, the author found some creativity in word and technique, the frequency of her word choice was so distracting I found myself rolling my eyes and gritting my teeth.  The number of times she uses the same descriptors is similar to that of an elementary student and was distracting and irritating.  Amongst her favorites; \\"mouths formed a hard line\\",and any time a character spoke, they \\"mumbled\\".  This sounds nit-picky, but she used the same phrases over and over and over.<br /><br />Despite whether graphic sexual content is your cup of tea, the writing itself was the most appalling and offensive part of reading this trilogy.  While I could ignore the too frequent sexual scenes, I could not ignore the amateur approach of writing and would have enjoyed it more if the writer focused more in depth on the minds and thoughts of the characters than their bedroom shenanigans. If you are looking for a classic, witty, and smart romance- this is not the book for you. If you are looking for a book with some sex in it and far-fetched fiction without depth, it may be the book for you as long as you don't mind reading the same words over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over...<br /><br />I don't know whether to point the finger at the author or the editor... step it up folks!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and a lot like the old Mario games on NES. Get it now
B0073V7YTY|4.0|I tend to download everything in a category and test them all. This one seemed to have a nicer interface than the other apps. That being said, they all seem to perform at the same level. The only problem I have with the Smart Tools Co. app is the advertising and no option to purchase an ad free version.
B005TBN3EU|2.0|I think the best word to describe this movie would be 'boring'. It appears the thought of spending more than 5 hours developing a script was just too much for the writers.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it. The games are challenging without being too difficult. There is a lot of variety so you will definitely find multiple games you will enjoy.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love all the movies and now the game is better. unlike other build. your own community game this one allows you to play the game and its very enjoyable you don't need to buy things every few seconds.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game!!! love getting coins for it!!! you can get more coins for submitting a review... this is a great game to download
B007MNV5WU|3.0|Im kind of pissed of that there are only 2 worlds in this game AND it cost 3 dollers. total ripoff
B004EPYZQ2|3.0|We have all seen this movie before and Goonies did it better. This movie was a yawner to me because I felt as if I had already seen it before many of times. The formula is just too familiar. What made it so funny while watching the movie in the theater for the first time, I imagined one of the kids calling one of the older characters \\"Old Man\\" blah blah blah. Well about 10 minutes later, one of the kids was referring to the older character as \\"Old man\\" blah blah blah. They have to stop making this movie.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I. had high hopes given the history behind the Oregon Trail games of past, but this plays just like all those social games on facebook. not really worth my time or money.
0385342063|2.0|I normally breeze through Sophie's books in 3 or 4 days. This one took me over two weeks. The beginning and ending were decent, but the middle was boring. Many many pages that did not add to the plot. Hate to say that I will not recommend this one to friends.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I would have paid the price of the entire set just for the 49 minute sequence filmed in 1975 at Earls Court in Britain alone!  The totally acoustic versions of \\"Going To California\\" and \\"That's The Way\\" are incredibly beautiful and intimate.  Then there is \\"In My Time of Dying\\" and \\"Trampled Underfoot\\".  And to top if off, one of the most popular rock songs of all time...\\"Stairway to Heaven\\"!  Watching and listening to Jimmy Page as he performs is mind-blowing.  I am still not sure if he is of this Earth.
0446607274|5.0|I'm making my way through the Bosch series and couldn't put this one down. My only grumble is the kindle version has quite a few spelling errors which was a little distracting.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My son and I love this app. Great for passing time. The only thing I dislike is all the ads between the games.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the first book in this trilogy and I loved the second one even more! So much more drama. This book had me on the edge of my seat...eyes welling up with tears at some parts, heart racing during others. Holy Hannah! So glad that we got more than just a peak into Christian's past. No matter how controlling and dominating he seems, you can't help but love him and have your heart ache because of his childhood and all of his effed-up-ness. What can I say...I was dreaming about this book and sometimes wondering why I couldn't bump into Christian Grey in real life. :)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this app because it has multiple different games and allows a challenge by making you get a certain amount of points so that you can buy more games.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Oh man. After hearing about this trilogy from a few different places, I came here for reviews. Although it generally gets great ratings, some people just hated this book. So I decided to try the free sample. Boy am I glad I did! I could not put it down! I am not into the crazy, erotic sex that is in the book, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading this story. I got so caught up into what was happening to Ana and why Christian had these issues. My heart was beating out of my chest and I couldn't read fast enough it seemed. Go ahead and buy it...you'll be glad you did. Just a forewarning though...you will miss out on sleep because you cannot put this story down!
0439023521|5.0|When I read this book I could not put it down and when I finished I was obsessed I love this book!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This has been a very useful workday alarm app, and I am suggesting it to my Mom for medication timing.  It is great being able to set multiple alarms with custom titles and songs.  Using math questions to dismiss the alarm is a good idea, but I have started avoiding that on mornings that I want to avoid disturbing my husband while fumbling over the app...  :)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|a lot more to do than the original game I just wish you did the traveling the got to do the settlement
B0054JZC6E|5.0|best time waster ever! I wish it was a little more better in controls but its still great! Everyone needs to play this game.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I never thought I would get totally addicted to a game.  This game is the ultimate escape and a lot of fun
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an awesome app. get this if u want to strenghten ur faith and become closer to Jesus ur Savior. whoever made this app is awesome
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this series. I read all three books in one weekend! The book was exciting and left you making predictions about each of the characters. I would read these books again.
B0065IA4F2|4.0|The cd was ok. I only have about 4 or 5 songs that I really listen to off of it.
B003UESJH4|5.0|The British monarchy has long been a subject of fascination for the American populace. This movie is an excellent look behind the scenes of the monarchy at a time of great change. It also sheds light on the debilitating condition of stuttering. I know I enjoyed watching the King's Speech - I couldn't believe that was really Helena Bonham Carter!!
B000FCJZ4K|1.0|Lucky guy, i can not have a refund on Kindle book, he should kiss the A of Amazon on Daily basis.<br /><br />Nothing Unique, his life and over various jobs or what he did. only title is good Never Eat Alone.  Sole message of the book network
B006AX6ONI|5.0|This is a quick read.... you could easily read it in a couple of hours.<br /><br />Yes, it is a series of posts, but I found it to be thought provoking from the standpoint of his approach to business, his advice for how to approach your business, and how he ended up doing the things he did.<br /><br />It really made me think, and I recommend it for small business owners who are thinking about their focus, motivation, etc.<br /><br />He is also very interesting to watch on Shark Tank, as are all of the \\"sharks\\", on television (Friday nights).  If you haven't seen the show, it's also a great business lesson every week.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I actually heard about this book from my 17 year old babysitter, then saw that the movie was coming out. So did a little review research on Amazon and after all the great reviews from other 40 somethings I decided to download the trilogy to my kindle. I have to say \\"I loved these books\\"! Books One was the best and I highly recommend you read the book before seeing the movie. A lot is going on in the heroins head that the movie cannot reveal and if you don't read the book you will never know how things really end. Well worth the read.. Download and enjoy!

B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book is an education into the world of sadomasochism, If you ever wanted to get into the head of a masochist this book will take you there. I have to say I was always a little put off by this type of behavior, but only because it was something I really didn't understand. Read the book and it changed my mind. As a woman most of us have to be in total control of our daily lives and the bedroom is one place we can learn to let go. Read the book and you will understand what I am talking about. Not the best book I ever read, but a fun change.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is the best game in the world. I play it all the time with my friends we have games who can stay alive the longest. over all I think that everyone should get this game
B007SSDS24|5.0|This movie paces in an excellent manner. All the characters were new and never once did I get the impression that they were just acting. The science behind the aliens and weapons were all real possibilities. Sci-fyer's would enjoy this one. A \\"must\\" add to sci-fy DVD collection. I'm hoping for a continuing series.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Lots of fun and simple to learn but challenging at the same time. Couldn't ask for more. Can't wait to try the next one.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Simple graphics (so it runs great on lower end devices), the gameplay is really wonderful. easy to understand and just plain fun! Stop reading and download it!
B006OCM0G0|4.0|this game is pretty fun. too many things need to be purchased with gems that you actually have to purchase, which ill never do. also, a lot of the dishes take a long time, sometimes days to make, which is just kind of long and annoying. fun nonetheless however.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|The life of Margaret Thatcher, told in flashbacks to all periods of her life as the reflections of a woman in mental decline who is also recently widowed - a very eerie concept that I found spellbinding - I don't agree with those who say this story moves too slowly. This was a fascinating history lesson, especially for those who are not British and for whom her political stances in Great Britain were unknown. Meryl Streep is nothing short of perfect; a performance where the actor/actress disappears and the character emerges - we need more performances of this caliber, regardless of the subject matter. The supporting cast, especially Jim Broadbent, who weaves in and out of Thatcher/Streep's consciousness as the movie progresses, is excellent.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|A lot of reviewers whine about energy running out so quickly.  Yeah it does, but treat it as a challenge instead.  If you are looking for 3 minutes of fun don't bother with this one,  but if your attention span exceeds that length it's worth a try.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|the game takes a lot of time and patience.  could cost some money if you don't like taking your time.
B0073PZIYI|5.0|I liked Andrew Niccol's \\"Gattaca\\" and \\"The Truman Show\\" allegories and I like \\"In Time\\" as well. It is a dystopian \\"Brave New World\\" type of future, dealing with the corrupt nature of banking and how the oppressed peasant sheeple might finally wake up to their servitude, to an evil bankster oligarchy, and rebel.<br /><br />Actually what our current evil bankster oligarchy appear to have planned, in terms of a massive sheeple cull and how they plan to control the remaining sheeple herd through RFID type technology, is probably even worse than this \\"In Time\\" allegorical warning. \\"Worse\\" in that the banksters could simply steal \\"money units\\" from the individual \\"bank accounts\\" and track dissident individuals with ease, making any kind of \\"In Time\\" type of rebellion against the \\"Panopticon Bankster System\\" impossible. Reference Aaron Russo (RIP) and the Nick Rockefeller interview.<br /><br />As H.G Wells noted in his \\"The New World Order\\" (WW2 era) warning: \\"In the technically crude past, the illiterate Have-nots were sweated and overworked. It was easy to find toil to keep them all busy. Such surplus multitudes are wanted no more. Toil is no longer marketable. Machines can toil better and with less resistance.\\" So it is hard for me to see why, in the future, the evil oligarchy would even need this hypothetical oppressed slave class of worker drones, desperately trying to \\"buy time\\" to stay alive another day. Zbigniew Brzezinski: \\"It's easier to kill a million people...than it is to control them.\\"<br /><br />The idea that a \\"forever young\\" oligarch might get tired of life after more than 100 years of healthy luxury life, at the expense of a hypothetical slave class rushing around trying to accumulate enough minutes to stay alive, was very well made. Human souls might well \\"live to regret\\" trying to live forever in this current kind of body vehicle. The limited human body life cycle has the benefit of being long enough (at say 70 - 100 years) for a soul to learn quite alot before the body vehicle finally breaks down and the \\"driver\\" is forced to leave the vehicle. A body vehicle that did not eventually break down (naturally) might indeed become rather boring and soul destroying after a while.<br /><br />The idea that a much loved daughter of an evil bankster might \\"see the light\\" and want to destroy the evil bankster system was also interesting I thought.<br /><br />AYoung2084.com<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Lord Acton, Lord Chief Justice of England, 1875 - \\"The issue which has swept down the centuries and which will have to be fought sooner or later is The People versus The Banks.\\"<br /><br />\\"And remember, where you have a concentration of power in a few hands, all too frequently men with the mentality of gangsters get control. History has proven that.\\" Lord Acton (1834 - 1902)<br /><br />\\"Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\\" Lord Acton<br /><br />\\"The danger is not that a particular class is unfit to govern: every class is unfit to govern.\\" Lord Acton
B003Y2BMVC|4.0|I didn't have high hopes for this movie, as much of what I had heard about it was negative. It turns out to be an good movie and the alternate universe this is set in is interesting. It was a fun movie to watch with my wife.
B001TAJGO6|5.0|The first time I saw this I enjoyed it a lot, but I came away a bit befuddled. The second time I was riveted and came away deeply, achingly sad.  I had been so distracted by Kaufmann's gimmickry and strange narrarative I had missed the film's underlying emotional wallop.  Then a wierd thing happened: over the course of the next 5 years or so, Eternal Sunshine moved its way up the ladder to became one of my all time favorites.  This film seeps into your psyche and digs in.<br /><br />A few other reviewers have called this their favorite romantic movie.  It is heart-breakingly romantic, but not in the way you expect.  One of the last lines of dialog spoken in the film is one of the most romantic lines ever delivered.  I can quote it here without a spoiler alert:  \\"OK\\".  Of course out of context, it means nothing.  But if I put it in context, I give the whole theme of the movie away.  And it's something best realized on one's own to appreciate its devastating power.  If you don't get it right away, don't worry, watch again.  You will.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is awesome I love it its so fun works great on fire. its loads of fun for any age.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is adorable!!! definately a family friendly game. you could get addicted very fast. and it moves pretty quickly<br />, in the beggining so you aren't waiting forever to achieve the goals.
B000YMJA7I|5.0|Excellent music from the vanguard band of its time.  Music files were delivered flawlessly by Amazon and uploaded to iTunes with absolutely no problems.
B005N4F37S|4.0|then you will love this extended version of Gettysburg.  Of course, it is very long - intended as a sweeping epic.  Jeff Daniels is thoroughly excellent as Joshua Chamberlain (which he plays in an understated and respectful manner), and Tom Berenger is adequate as confederate General Longstreet (the accent comes and goes arbitrarily), but I would have liked to have seen Robert Duvall return from Gods and Generals as Robert E. Lee instead of Martin Sheen. Duvall played the part with more gravitas and solemn dignity. Stephen Lang returns as George Pickett after portraying Stonewall Jackson in Gods and Generals, which felt somewhat strange. Fortunately, Lang is an excellent actor who clearly did many hours of actual character research.<br /><br />Overall, the story narrative follows many details of the battle of Gettysburg correctly, and many spoken lines are taken directly from historical accounts.  It is, of course, possible to quibble with which parts of Gettysburg are shown and which are omitted, but to include all would have necessitated additional hours to an already extended movie.  However, because the battle fought on Little Round Top and the exploits of the 20th Maine are the main thrust of the movie storyline, the only real narrative choice I would venture to take exception to is the complete failure to include the monumental gaffe of Dan Sickles that cost the union many thousands of casualties and the led to the decimation of the 20th Maine.<br /><br />The Wheat Field is only mentioned cursorily, and the epic speech of Father Corby to the Irish brigade is given a fleeting glimpse. The Northern end of the battlefield is entirely ignored after the events of the first day. But again, realizing that the movie must have a reasonable time frame, these omissions are understandable.  There are lots of small details that history lovers will recognize, such as General Pickett rushing out to observe the fighting from the red farmhouse in the middle of the battlefield,and the narrative of the close friendship between Generals Armistead and Hancock.  Overall, I highly recommend this movie to those who love Civil War history.
B00753MBHA|5.0|I have to agree with all the five stars for this one. Once again, Accept hits paydirt with an incredibly wild, Rockin' record, a  brilliant followup to \\"Blood of The Nations\\". I have to admit, I was not that much of a fan of these guys back in their first life, primarily put off by their singer Udo, but now with singer Mark Tornillo, this band is back, with a second and even stronger effort. Great songs here, brilliant production & execution, this one Rocks, big time. All hard rock & metal fans should love this!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|FANTASTIC series of books....read them one after the other within a few days, as I wanted to see what happened!!!! Even though i am 53, I do enjoy these books, written for the \\"tweenager\\".  They are extremely well written, keep you guessing, still have the \\"great read\\", with the violence, bit of romance and HEAPS of adventure. Would recommend them as general reading, really for any age.

0741470314|5.0|Having grown up with the Jackson Five and danced to their music St the local dances before they went to Motown, it was heart warming to read Dr. Moriarty's book on MJ.  Through her extensive research and sources - from every genre and people who had a wide variety of roles with MJ during his lifetime - Dr. Moriarty brings to life the human being who was Michael Jackson and the enormous challenges that fame and success put on his plate.  The focus of this book is on MJ, the father, friend, employer, son, brother, performer and philanthropist - very different, thank goodness, from the books that focus on the trial and greed that MJ had thrust upon him.  Dr. Moriarty shares her sensitivity and passion by writing a biography that shows us all that MJ was not only the king but a human being.  This is a MUST READ for all - MJ fans and the curious who will become MJ fans before the end of the book.  Thanks to Dr. Moriarty for her incredible research, time and passion!  Carol from NW Indiana
B007PTJOV0|3.0|this is jus for kids not adults its dumb but my kids like it so I'm going to<br />keep it

B0054JELS4|5.0|simple and sa·li·ent review.  just saying.<br /><br />i bought the set which contained seasons 1-8 but this goes for all the seasons separate or otherwise.  from the first episode through the season 8 this show has been consistently well written, acted and produced & has had very few episodes that were below average.  i haven't season any of season 9 which is currently airing now but i can tell you this show is always great and never disappoints.  these dvd sets are all pretty much designed and set up the same with the exception of season 7 which the case is slightly different.  the average amount of extras you normally see on dvds.  the dvd menus are easy to navigate but they are slightly better as the seasons came out.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|animal zoo like game its cute, you have quests to do and you get to see all the character's and it keeps your interest, the only bad thing is the acorns cost real money but that's with every game so.......

B007PTJOV0|4.0|leps world is fun and entertaining. My only complaint is the lack of level imagination, if you will, they were all quite similar.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|Bad design when putting ads over buttons when trying to play the game.  Graphics are pretty good and game is responsive.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its pretty fun it keep u busy and many games to play and. it makes you want to play for hours
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My brother is dumb,  he did not like angrybirds at all, I was like&quot; Mikey are you dumb&quot; and I think he is crazy! I personally love this game! But one tip,  try to fix bugs,and don't do video ads,  who agrees,  and make a bird were you can shoot it and then it allows you to add another bird to the game and make a pink or purple one!
B0018M6J90|5.0|To me this is a Chick Flick with enunciation problems. It has a wonderful cast even though most of us went strictly to see Frances McDormand (\\"Blood Simple,\\" \\"Paradise Road,\\" \\"Lone Star\\" and \\"Fargo\\") as Miss Pettigrew. To any of you who have the least trouble understanding dialog in films where they whisper or confide in low tones, get the DVD from Amazon.com and turn on the captions.<br /><br />For everyone else, enjoy this frothy piece set in the late 1930s London, which depicts a ditsy American actress and singer, played by Amy Adams (\\"Enchanted\\" and \\"Charlie Wilson's War\\"), as she juggles her three men:<br />  * Lee Pace (\\"Infamous\\" and \\"The Good Shepherd\\") who plays Michael, the pianist who loves her. He looks like either Colin Farrell or Clive Owens' younger brother. A key moment takes place when he forces her to sing \\"If I Didn't Care\\" as part of her nightclub act...sigh...<br />  * Tom Payne (British TV), as Phil, the besotted young lover she is manipulating into both marriage and a starring role in his next big theatrical production.<br />  * Mark Strong (\\"Stardust\\" and \\"Syriana\\") is Phil, the smarmy lover/promoter who owns both the elegant apartment where she lives and the nightclub that employs her.<br /><br />McDormand is a just-fired governess/nanny who, in a desperate move (it's the 1930s, so \\"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\\" plays in the background during the montage which illustrates her tribulations), bluffs her way into a day's worth of employment with the actress.<br /><br />During the course of the day (because she doesn't want to be seen \\"with Oliver Twist's aunt!\\"), the actress takes Miss Pettigrew shopping (\\"Anything Goes\\" is on the soundtrack), where our doughty heroine meets a fashion designer, played by Ciarán Hinds (\\"Persuasion\\" and \\"There Will be Blood\\"). Actually, she dumps her lunch on his shoes...<br /><br />Lots of elegant sets, costumes, food; lots of period automobiles and street scenes; lots of sappy situations solved by clever maneuvering by Miss Pettigrew. It's funny and light, but deucedly difficult to hear. I enjoy the captions on my DVD.
B007BFZGAG|2.0|Hadn't bought a new album in forever until Google Play had a deal where I could get Drake's CD for a quarter. Yes, $0.25. After listening to that album on repeat, I decided that maybe it was time to start purchasing music again.<br /><br />With Tyga, I was feeling pretty much every mainstream song I heard from him. Nothing groundbreaking or thought provoking, but nice club bangers and songs that go hard.<br /><br />Unfortunately, none of the tracks that haven't been released are in the same vein as his mainstream songs. The are about him trying to be personal and deep. I think that after listening to Drake address personal issues in such a unique and refreshing fashion, hearing Tyga try to do the same falls miserably short.<br /><br />I just can't get over the fact that none of his singles allude to this fact. All his previous music has been about strip clubs, smoking and sex. All of his new songs are just not for the club and not really unique or saying anything new.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good games for the price. though i wish you had more time for some games. something to fill in time or a break from reading

B007SYWFRM|5.0|Working great so far for me on Kindle Fire.  Wished there was a more straight forward way to lock down in app purchases.<br />.

B003VANOFY|1.0|When I unboxed my new expensive G930s and tried them on, I thought, for a period of about 5 wonderful minutes, that I had made a great decision in purchasing these headphones.<br /><br />Then I installed the headphones.... You see I run a vertically cooled desktop tower, and as it is MASSIVE I can not put it on my desk. Because the heat escapes via a fan on the top of the tower, I can not put it under my desk. So my tower is sitting about 2 feet away from me at the side of my desk. Apparently this is too much for the G930's wireless to handle.<br /><br />I stuck the wireless USB receiver in a front USB port so it would have unobstructed line of sight to the headphones when I had them on. However, the massive 2 foot chasm between the headphones and the receiver proved too mighty for our hero, the G930. So I installed drivers... messed with options... uninstalled and reinstalled via the CD that accompanies the headset.<br /><br />At long last I got the headphones to connect to my PC wirelessly - but only when it is being charged via the USB charging wire... so now my G930 is kina wireless, kinda not. Even on full charge the damn thing will shut itself down if I unplug it.<br /><br />So, our hero the G930, having triumphed over the 2 wireless gap, was ready for action. So I started to play some games with it. After about 10 minutes I heard a beep and the wireless connection had failed. So I took off my headphones and placed them right next to the receiver and pressed the connect button. After many many tries the connection was reestablished.<br /><br />I've been forced to live with these new headphones for a few weeks now, and as I eagerly await the arrival of some proper headphones I continue to have the same problems. From 2 feet away the headphones will disconnect if I move my head at all, and will even disconnect if I sit stone still. The longest stretch of uninterrupted sound I ever had with these things after a few weeks is about 2 HOURS. THAT IS RARE FOR THESE HEADPHONES.<br /><br />Oh.. and did I mention they break into static randomly? Yeah. And turning it off/on, unplugging and replugging the USB devices, etc.- that doesn't fix it. Only waiting out the static works.<br /><br />Pros: 1.Good sound cancelling<br />  2.Good quality sound (on rare occasion between disconnects and static bursts)<br />  3.Lots of settings quickly available via the G keys<br /><br />CONS: 1.The wireless is abysmal<br />  2.The latest drivers have 0 positive effect on the headphones<br />  3.Painful static bursts occur randomly and often<br />  4.Must be connected to the charger at all times to work<br />  5.SOUND INTERRUPTIONS EVERY 10 MINUTES/EVERY HOUR DEPENDING ON HOW THE G930 FEELS LIKE BEHAVING<br />  6.Establishing a connection is a craps shoot after the connection gets interrupted<br />  7.Sound cancellation can make talking through the mic kind of odd- like a deaf person you can't hear your own voice and it throws you off<br /><br />SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS HEADSET. The waste of money will seem like a MINOR INCONVENIENCE compared to the hours you will spend trying to fix this BROKEN product.<br /><br />Don't let logitech, a company that usually makes good products, get away with this abortion of a headset. DO NOT PURCHASE THE LOGITECH G930! You're better off with ipod headphones and a 10 year old desk mic.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is so fun when u start it you cant stop!! I love it because it so creative and fun.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The music is soothing, the puzzles challenging without being frustrating. The graphics are crisp and the motion smooth. I recommend this game.
B0052U59F4|1.0|my brain hurts , the story of this stupid woman with her &#34;oh, he is so hot&#34; obsessive stalker went against everything I thought has to do with love . The writing is so bad that I garantie if this would have been an essay at school it would had failed. What complete garbage
B007IXWKUK|5.0|by now everyone has heard about these books and their main draw. I was very happy to find that there is actually a really good story behind all the sex which was approaching over kill at some points. Christians past is further explored and dealt with. He can be very controlling and overbearing but this is a coping mechanism so it didn't bother me and kind of made me feel for the character every time he had one of his moments because you can see the pain he is going through under the surface. I liked Anastasia's character too. Yes she is completely tied up with Christian but she at least fights for her own best interest and independence can see the issues with her situation even if in the end she may not get her way in the end. Overall a really great series which I wouldn't have seen myself recommending/admitting I had actually read it before i began.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is pretty good entertainment. its kind of like frontwierville on facebook. I would recommend this game to others who like building and adventure games.
0345803485|5.0|This is the first book of this type I have ever read. I could not put it down. It kept me coming back for more. I have pre-ordered the second of the trilogy. Until then, maybe I can get some studying done for school.
B007BT0RKG|5.0|Offline maps for free. Five stars for that with none of the hassle of caching etc.  Very fast but I do hope they introduce a search function soon, maybe navigation but i cant complain given that its free.  Open Street Map seems to be improving too but it still need some time.  Im on Galaxy SII...more please guys!
B004LWZW8I|4.0|IMO, films in general, and this film specifically, are meant to take us away from the day to day drudge of life and reality and transport us into a couple of hours of entertainment and imagination. Immortals may not be a multi-award winning film, but it does seem like the masses whine and complain about every film that isn't.  Trust me, not every award winner is a good film, and not every good film is an award winner.<br />It does all it needs to with decent acting, great SPEFX and a decent storyline. Films based on Greek Mythology and fantasy are among my first choice for passing a little time and putting aside the real world for a while, and Immortals does this very well.<br />If you try to watch it assuming you'll take away some sort of educational meaning or moral lesson you'll just be disappointed - that's not what movies are about - take it for what it is and lighten up, you'll be better for it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it is great! kind of like a more detailed farmtown from face book. love it and would recommend. my kids love it too.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|very similar to Mario...but it is still a good time killer. good for almost any age. will play tip its beat.
0199536619|3.0|The book is a set of excerpts from private remembrances while at the Ramsays family beach house. The remembrances centre round Mrs Ramsay both while she is alive as well as after her death. There is s strong sense of melancholy about human transience set against the impassiveness of the house itself - and the lighthouse.<br />Just as the book begins to envelope me within the small world of the Ramsays, the self-conscious cleverness disturbs the engagement. My mind receeds from the Ramsays and instead sees Virginia Woolf sitting and thinking of some phrase for readers more impressed by cleverness than simple sincerity.<br />Nevertheless, I enjoyed the book for this cleverness of language, as well as the many short sections where I was transported, iluminated, impressed and intrigued.
B006964E8S|5.0|This book followed the usual David Baldacci formula - one that keeps you guessing, has strong characters that are believable as well as a little implied romance along the way.  Really enjoyed reading it and I hope that David Baldacci keeps John Puller as a main character in another one of his books.  This book is difficult to put down and a fantastic read.

B000J5XS3C|1.0|In contrast to the case, which looks solid, the power supply connection is extremely fragile.  When I inserted the connector into the unit, one of the pins bent over and contacted the plug shield, shorting the connection and blowing the power supply.<br /><br />I've been plugging things in for a while now, this is the first time this has happened to me.  For a unit without an on-off switch I'd think the power connector would be an important thing to get right.<br /><br />The problem is the electrical pins are as long as or longer than the alignment stud so when I spun the connector around in the socket it scraped the electrical pins off alignment and when I matched the alignment stud and pushed the connector in, it didn't socket the electrical pins, it bent 'em off.<br /><br />It's arguably my fault, but it's also arguably a design defect.  I'd send it back but what are they going to do?  Send me another?  So it's off to Radio Shack for a new power supply and solder.  Good thing I'm a techie.  :)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves this game. It keeps her busy and entertained. I just wish it had more than one little movie that plays at the movie theater.
B0055SWM08|5.0|a creative puzzle game with fun twists added as you go that really keep it interesting. I appreciate the gradually increasing difficulty:  some games get crazy hard after just a few levels before you get the hang.  this one is just right.  will definitely pay for their next game when I finish this one (was faotd).

0800141806|1.0|Federal law, in one of its numerous unfunded mandates, in effect orders enterprises large and small to keep ill people in their employ and thus pay for their medical bills. That's the law, so be it. It could make for an interesting courtroom drama as a top legal firm defends itself against violating this law when it dismissed an attorney who concealed his AIDS infection. But what the movie does is politicize the case by using it to denounce the US as homophobic, racist, and oligarchic, plus sentimentalize a homosexual who did not protect himself against AIDS. I see the resulting movie as a cheap exploitation of the subject, with theatrics in the courthouse and lots of schmalz elsewhere.

B007SYWFRM|3.0|When I played this game it was fun and all but the only problem was you have no idea how to get back to your home page. You have to press stuff then something you have to press to get out then the home thing will come up and you have to press it quickly. So overall if you don't know how to get to your home page do not and I mean NEVER GET THIS GAME INLESS YOUU WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME FOREVER!

081297381X|3.0|If you are someone wedded to inductive logic and rest content in the belief that, since all the swans you have seen are white, all swans are white, then a visit to Australia will cause you pain and surprise.  For there, down south, swans are black and you would have been a fool to have depended on your inductive generalisation. Taleb, guru to David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, and to many others, is telling us inducto-logicians not to count our chickens before they are hatched because we are going to be surprised, no matter what the hen house. This is the central theme repeated in many pretty variations in this non-technical and largely autobiographical musing on how we mostly think incorrectly about events. Taleb is cultured, well-read, and is, no doubt, a charming companion, but I have to admit to a strange feeling of nausea reading his book, because it exudes the palpable air of self-satisfaction that comes from being able to extend the life and worth of a good idea way beyond its natural lifetime and innate worth. The tocsin beat of his message dulls the senses, though leavened by sometimes amusing and often interesting autobiographical details. That extreme results in systems - the Black Swans of the title - occur and we should be wary of them seems neither surprising nor comforting.  Taleb argues the point conversationally without much support of the data. One fact he highlights which may indeed be surprising to many but which does not actually support his thesis in the slightest, that over the last 50 years of financial markets the ten most extreme days were responsible for half the returns.  Taleb is Lebanese, and one of the examples of Black Swans that he describes is how suddenly without any warning at all Lebanon woke up to a civil war that lasted 15 years. He was a member of an elite family in a multicultural, multi-faceted region where a 'mosaic' of religions and cultures lived '...in a state of stable equilibrium'. The place '...was exceedinglyopen to the world, with a vastly sophisticated lifestyle, a prosperous economy and temperate weather...' Taleb, a member of the elite, went to a privileged school and spoke and wrote in French and yet he says '...after close to thirteen centuries of remarkable ethnic coexistence, a Black Swan, coming out of nowhere, transformed the place from heaven to hell...'  From Taleb's lofty vantage point, we learn that his principle complaint about the war was that '...The number of cultured people dropped below some critical level.  Suddenly the place became a vacuum.'  It simply cannot be true that the Lebanon civil war came out of nowhere.  Taleb needs it to be so for his thesis but his disingenuousness is unpalatable. At the time Lebanon law divided political roles among religions.  The president had to be a Christian and the Speaker of the Parliament a Muslim.  Shia Muslims were working class among whom the Hezbollah developed and the Kurdish section had no voting rights.  The Catholic political party was a fascist militia.  It seems to me that what is wrong with his depiction of Lebanon is wrong with his entire thesis.  Black Swans do not come out of nowhere, nor are people necessarily in denial about their existence. The faults in inductive generalisations are known and Black Swan moments are experiences common to many histories.  If politicians, financial operators and comfortable elites ignore them it is for other factors than ignorance, and Taleb's warning does not really hit the mark with these groups nor with the man-in-the-street who has little power to avoid them even if he suspects they are coming. What is clear - something else that Taleb does not really apply himself to - is that normal business probably cannot be conducted at all unless we all agree that Black Swan events will not happen right now. If Black Swans cannot be predicted (the ludic fallacy, says Taleb) then it makes no sense trying to take them into account in the present. Just how economicallyviable is it to take into account the costs of the hundred year flood protection when your profit cycle is only three years or only five or only ten? How can your investment funds provide the sought for returns for your investors if you only plan for stock market crashes? When the stock market crash of 1987 happened Taleb, a financial quant at the time, was sitting pretty though quite how is not explained, and he raked in a vast bonus at year-end on which he founded his subsequent idleness. Taleb lets us believe that he profited out of precisely that calculation for Black Swans, but he is short on how he did it, which suggests to this reviewer that it was luck rather than planning that got him through.  The book is not especially technical at all though Taleb does explain what is doubtful about average statistics (they purposely ignore outliers - the Black Swans) and Bell curves and Gaussian distributions, but doesn't let on when they apply and when they don't (when data points are dependent or independent).  Taleb seems to have as many detractors as fans and hints darkly at fights at conferences with those who disagree with him but he seems well connected with many of the key developers of chaos theory and its offspring, though his larks with Mandelbrot, touching upon fractals, don't support his own thesis since fractal proportions are well understood and do not contain surprises to catch you out. He refers the reader continually to the idea that nothing is certain and you are better off taking the regular pay packet without any conviction. You are left with the idea that he really admires the really rich not only because he likes to move among them but because they are the people the Black Swans never wipe out.
0393072231|5.0|The title say it all. There were those who lost in 2008 (unfortunately it was the American people mostly) and those who won (some smart-freaking people, not me though DAMN). A great read and something to hold on to and re-read every few years.

B001NLKT60|5.0|I loved the second of Larsson's books as well as the first. I'm now reading the third book, and I'm definitely hooked! These books are packed with suspense and are exciting books to read. I would recommend them to anyone who likes espionage and thrillers!
0451219597|5.0|Jackdaws is the stoy a young female British secret agent in WW11 called Flick, who parachutes into France with a team of five female agents in order to carry out a daring raid on a Nazi communictions centre. I have to admit to being a big fan of books about 'The Special Operations Executive (SOE) who were the main players in WW11 to carry out this type of mission and Ken Follett as usual proves to be an expert in historic detail. However, this is not just a book for (SOE) fans this is a book for anyone who enjoys a fast paced action adventure novel that is packed with excitment right up to the last page. I have no trouble giving this book 5 stars.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|its alright I mean don't get me wrong if I were u I would buy but it is. just like Mario. so if u like Mario than u woulld like this game or app what ever u want to call it

B007R41E8O|5.0|kindle fire owners; be sure to change your display settings to sleep after an hour.  the download goes fast if your kindle doesnt go into sleep mode.  not sure y that is but try it yourself.  i havent played much so far but i wish i could turn off the clues...maybe this is just how it is in the beginning.  maybe like a tutorial of sorts.  anyway solid entry to these types of games although seems more hidden object oriented than say  the lost city
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love, love, love this game. The graphics are great. Things move along at a pretty good pace. Great way to spend some free time.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I have a lot of time to kill while recovering and I can't sit for long so this game has been a real boredom killer. It runs fairly smoothly on my kindle fire so I can play while laying down. It's sort of a merge of Farmville (with much faster crops) and Oregon Trail. My main complaint is you run out of energy quickly and the biggest complaint is the 15 dollars you start out with seems to be all you get. I don't like paying real money for virtual cash lol.. call me cheap. Other than that,  great game :)

It is very easy to connected to a Receiver, nice to handle and control now I can hear all my old albams, the only thing want I don't like it is cable to the receiver it too short and missing a usb cable, with these two items, overall it is a completed good handle stereo turntable.

B007MNV5WU|3.0|I think that this is by far the best Angry Birds game I have ever played! Such a great buy. Well worth anyone's money. If you aren't sure about it, I say it definitely gets 5 stars from me.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really love the option of getting a winning deal. It gives me all the fun and relaxation without the frustration.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is very fun and addictive it also doesn't use much power fun for the whole family highly reccomend this game .
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I found John Locke's book to be very informative and clearly written.  I intend to try some of the ideas I gained from this short primer and then to reread the book for anything else I might have missed!  I would highly recommend this book to any new author who has written a good book and is a little confused about how to publish and promote it.  It might also be of interest to the more seasoned writer who is looking for a better marketing plan.  I know it significantly changed my views and caused a lot of light bulbs to come on in my head!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This games are fun u have certain opptions at first but then your coins add up and u unlock games
B0055SWM08|5.0|really good game, makes you think, tests your patience, nice graphics and music too, very relaxing, intuitive gameplay. great game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Either this puzzle game is more doable than most, or it fits the way my mind works, but I love it. My wife's gotten into it too and has done equally well.
B002GHIPYI|4.0|You can't beat these studio headphones...for the price. They have serious Bass and pretty nice soundstaging. They are a bit lacking in the mids but what can you expect when you're paying less than 40 dollars. Also noticed, and a contributing factor to the loss of one star, is the volume at which they start to distort. That isn't to say they don't get loud enough to cause hearing damage without distorting at all. It also isn't to say that when the bass hits hard (provided you have a high quality sound source) they don't shake. They physically shake my ears. The bass in blu-ray movies is AWESOME. Good quality cable, long, sturdy, straight cord.<br /><br />They are quite comfy, with exception to the pleather. I've noticed the heat issues others are complaining about; it's not a big problem as I don't sweat a lot and I use them in an air-conditioned environment. It may bother some. I made it through a movie just fine and I'd like to think I'm picky.<br /><br />I'm not saying these headphones are simply a great buy for the price; for many people, these will be the nicest headphones they've ever listened to. They may easily be the most comfortable over-the-ear phones they've ever worn. I've owned Senn's and Bose's. I've listened to \\"Beats\\". They need a bit of time to burn-in before they come alive, as most large magnet phones do.<br /><br />If any issues arise under normal circumstances, I'll be sure to update!
B005K17RU0|5.0|simple and effective, includes must have information such as current temp and hourly forecasts but also an extended 15 day overview! as accurate as any other source.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After being captivated by the first 2 books, I had to finish out the series.  I was so worried there wouldn't be an ending and I would be in a world of emotional pain.  Although what happens in the book I hated because I'm a pacifist like Peetah, it kept me interested until the end and I am happy with the outcome.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I do not normally ready these types of books but enjoyed reading this series.  Read all three in a week.  It was fast moving and an attention grabber.  The third book dragged a little but loved the ending.
B000GT6KEU|5.0|I finally had to break down and buy this instead of renting it. There are so many layers in this movie that I find something new every time I watch it. I have watched this movie about 10 times, I obviously really like it. It. Is one of the very few broadway musicals with a rock and roll beat. The story is very poignant once you realize that most of the main characters have AIDS and expect to die soon. To me the story is mostly about the choices you make when you know you will die soon. Several catchy tunes too.
B000GIXEIG|4.0|I've seen a few renditions of Beowulf, but didn't want to purchase one that wasn't fairly close to the original writing.  Most of them are too sensationlized, but this was very nearly what I was looking for.

B00006J3WH|5.0|This cd is a great way to relive one of the best episodes of Buffy. The songs are all very catchy and the actors all have decent voices. This is a great album for Buffy fans or fans of musicals in general. As a bonus they have a few extra songs from other episodes that you will recognize if you are a big fan of Buffy. I love this album!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book because of the reviews. I never finished it because after about 100 pages I decided I didn't care what happened and it reads like revolting soft porn. I couldn't believe I had wasted money on it!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|not provided with enough energy to play the game. they want you to spend real money to buy something with no value...id rather flush my dollars down the toilet. that would be more fun than this game.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|My family and I really enjoyed this movie in 3D. I have a LG 55 cinema 3D TV and sit about 12 feet away and there are several great Out of screen effects that made the kids jump. The depth on this Blu-ray is one of the best I have ever seen. If you enjoy 3D movies this is a great movie to add to your collection.

B006BDHAX0|1.0|I've been enjoying playing this game until I reached arrangements in which the tiles are subtly misdrawn. In mahjong, it's critical to know which tiles are free to play. But in this version, some tiles which are not playable are drawn on top of playable tiles, as seen by their edges. This glitch makes these levels too hard to play. There are many people complaining that this game freezes up, but I haven't had this problem over several hours of usage on a Kindle Fire. Nevertheless, the above glitch means I cannot recommend this app.<br /><br />Update:  According to the product page, version 1.1.14, fixes the following bug:<br />\\"We had a problem in the arrangement of the tiles in some levels, some tiles from same level were displayed up from other tiles. This bug was fixed adding a new localization tiles code.\\" I haven't yet checked this fixes the glitch.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|id recommend this game to anyone who has kids. it will keep them entertained and it will some what teach them about the old days
B0055SWM08|4.0|Its a cute little game of puzzles, a slight feel of chess. Runs very smoothly on my droid X. No time clock to pester you, play at your own pace.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|just like Mario but a leprahachaun and a rainbow not a pole and you can throw PINECONES and snails try to get you
B007KB15BA|5.0|I really like(d) the Udo-fronted Accept and thought he could never be replaced, but I was wrong.  Mark Tornillo is every bit effective as Udo and dare I say, a better overall fit.  I'm a fan of TT Quick, with Metal of Honor ranking up there as one of my favorite metals albums, but Tornillo takes it to a whole other level with Accept and seems like *he's* been with them for the last 30 years.  Wolf Hoffmann's playing sounds as good as ever and overall the band has sounds like a tight and cohesive unit.  Andy Sneap has also done another excellent job of production making it easy to pick out every instrument but keeping everything tight and clean.  Love his work.<br /><br />Blood of The Nations was an awesome release, totally caught me off guard, but find I'm liking Stalingrad just a little bit more.  It could be because I was expecting a let down after BOTN, a tough act to follow, but that is totally not the case.  Stalingrad never lets up from start to finish and does not disappoint.  Top tracks for me are Hellfire (Hoffmann really cuts loose on this track), Revolution (nice mid-paced rocker with classic Accept backing vocals), and Flash To Bang Time (which will surely have you doing a lot of banging - of your head, and may be my favorite Accept track of all time).<br /><br />I'll avoid the cliched \\"it's the 1980's all over again\\" reference, in my opinion Accept has topped nearly all their prior releases with Stalingrad.  It's 2012, and Accept is alive and banging.  Join the Revolution!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am a anglophile to the core and was an Upstairs, Downstairs fan and thought you had hit the top in showing that phase of English life but this tops everything in not showing estate life with all of its problems, especially that of finding money for a land poor English nobleman across the pond in the tradition of Jennie Jerome and Consuello Vanderbilt.  I can't wait for season 3.

B002ZG993Q|2.0|Last night's bargain rack movie was \\"The American\\" DVD which I picked up at a nearby Ross Store. It starred George Clooney as, you guessed it, the American. The story took place in Sweden (a little bit) and Italy (mostly) and the filming was excellent. This part of italy was just beautiful, and quite picturesque and the photographers really picked it up. By and large, the acting was quite good, although there wasn't much in the way of character development with any of the people. The women were the best in this respect. The men were silent types with a cold and cruel personas.<br /><br />As to the story, it was an action movie without much action. The story had Clooney as some type of assassin (never really specified as to why) with a stone-faced man of few words as a distant accomplice. Their main contacts were through extremely limited phone conversations. Clooney was in on a botched job in Sweden, in which he cruelly and cold-bloodedly murdered his lady friend, and he was whisked off to Italy until the heat died down. Well, in Italy, he started to meet more rather nice women and worked on a high-tech assassination weapon. Too much of the movie was devoted to his work, I might add. You're looking for action? Well it never really unfolded, so I hope you're satisfied with a smattering of limited dialog. The movie was a tour of the largely empty streets of this charming Italian village and visits to their largely empty shops. Clooney portrayed an emotionless stone-faced killer on assignment, except the assignment was never specified. Oh yes, a number of guys wanted him dead, including one from Sweden. Ho-humm. If you want a one-word review, the word boring comes to mind but the photography was good enough to hold your attention.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is addictive. Even my husband plays.<br />Thanks for a simple way to stay sharp.<br />Good for the memory and a productive way to use time while you are waiting.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|Streep's performance is the main attraction in this otherwise rather uninteresting biopic.  The constant shifting from present to past is more of a distraction than a clever device.  When exactly did her husband die?  In the explosion?  Why did we not see more of her son and his family?  Why is her daughter barely there?
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a fun game to play that doesn't take a ton of skill to master. It has a lot of different options.

B0063GORYU|5.0|Like many others,  I'm almost surprised at the amount of time that I spend playing this game.  It's challenging,  but fair.  Sometimes you need to get lucky.  Once you have some success with two decks, completing three doesn't seem so far fetched.  I've yet to conquer four decks, but certainly plan to try.  Thank you for creating this very cool game.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like this game.  You can actually do stuff without having to wait so much.  Its a little confusing at the beginning.

B004MC8CA2|4.0|the appseemspretty easy to use. I like the fact that it encourages me to read more often. I do wish I. could choose the version(forexample NIV). It is a little difficult for my children to understand this version whenthey ask me to read it to them.<br /><br />It is also alittle difficult to go to a specific verse. overall pretty nice app for free.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game!  It's a lot of fun to play and so far I've been able to play for quite a while without running out of money or having to wait too long for something to finish.  Also, so far, I haven't had to beg friends for stuff.  I can't believe a game this fun with awesome graphics (and movies to watch) is free!  A must have game!

1439153663|5.0|This is a story that is written by a true story teller.  From start to finish there was not a moment that I wanted to stop reading about these amazing women. If you don't read this book you are missing one terrific read.<br />Enjoy

0439023521|1.0|There is some added romance and rebellion in this novel.  However, It is essentially the same exact story as the Japanese novel and movie Battle Royale.  This books gets an F for originality.
B00004XQ83|5.0|We enjoyed the movie a lot.  We often find ourselves singing or humming the songs from the movie.  I especially like \\"Go to Sleep Little Baby\\".  I personally like to \\"sing along\\" with the music.<br /><br />The cd is exactly what I expected.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Wow! What a let down. With way too many characters and plots to be entertaining, it just feels like work to try and keep up with it all. The author has carried the style of multiple story lines and points of view to a level I've never seen before (and hope to never see again). By the time he circles back around to a character (usually a half dozen or so chapters later), I've pretty much forgotten what was going on earlier, and not surprisingly, I no longer care very much.<br /><br />What a relief it was to read another book after this (Hunger Games) where one chapter led into the next! I wanted to like this book, but it just ended up annoying the hell out of me. I won't be buying any future books in this series, just not worth the time and effort.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I was very pleased with this lightweight sturdy plastic case for the Kindle fire. For protection (and looks) it beats the leather cases I have seen and it's cost is lower.
0307477479|3.0|This is an example of over-reaching: a popular, talented author tries to be clever with a unique method of story-telling. I call it less than a success despite the Pulitzer. (Really?)<br /><br />The different characters, their different \\"voices\\", the jumps in timeline...sometimes it was a bit difficult to figure out who was \\"talking.\\" That's a little too much work for me. Nonetheless, there are a few likeable characters and a bunch of very unlikeable ones. I wish that Egan had narrowed the scope of her story - a few less characters, a few less visits with them at different points in their lives. I didn't feel that I really got to know any of them and, as a result, I really didn't care about any of them.<br /><br />I read this book as part of a \\"requirement\\" for a book club. Needless to say, I am quitting the club.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a pretty good game, but I don't like the whole money system.  other than that I cant really complain too much.
030788743X|3.0|This book has been getting a lot of positive comment on the net so I thought I would try it out and I can see why.<br /><br />If you were to design a book to appeal to geeks, you couldn't really combine more key elements than are in play here. 80s culture, MMORPGs, random geek references and anime. It is sometimes annoyingly in its obsession with meta references. The absolute worst of which had to be the call out of Will Wheaton and Cory Doctorow part way through the story.<br /><br />At its core this is a very simple but enjoyable story with a young hero and his friends on a quest. Along the way the hero matures and finds love. It's fast paced and makes you want to keep reading.<br /><br />But the writing is clumsy. Perhaps the endless explanations of how to play Dungeons and Dragons or Zork are helpful to those who haven't played them, but for me they were an annoyance getting in the way of moving forward.<br /><br />And there's a *lot* of that. Explanations of how an MMO works, how a haptic suit works, what the TRS-80 was. And on, and on.<br /><br />I wasn't really convinced by the riddles either. They were essentially impossible to figure out unless you knew the answer and people just kept randomly getting them. It stretched credulity.<br /><br />So why did I keep reading. Because the characters were likeable and the heart of the story enjoyable. As was the setting when I wasn't being hit over the head by it.<br /><br />Good, but once again I have been lead to expect too much by people's praise.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its like all the other games with making a village. but this one is base off a movie and there are fun mini games to along with it.

B003O86FMW|2.0|I was really into the first book, but Catching Fire really just brought all of the annoyances that were in the back of my mind to the forefront.  Katniss is incredibly frustrating.  For someone who's supposed to be sharp as a tack and a hardcore survivor, she's awfully slow on the uptake.  I found myself frustrated with her as the story progressed because I saw exactly what was going on (side note: the story is too predictable), but she didn't have a clue.  She just didn't make sense to me, and wasn't a very believable person.  Just too overly-dramatic...<br /><br />BTW, what is with the ridiculous \\"inventions\\" of this book?  The suspension of disbelief was thoroughly ruined upon learning about \\"muttations\\" and \\"morphling.\\"  Lame...<br /><br />If you want to read a good dystopian book with some genuine twists and turns, you'd be MUCH better off reading The Giver.  Far superior, in my opinion.
B005H2IAM6|1.0|I watched this in the theaters when it opened in Japan, and my wife and I were sorely disappointed. While the first 5 minutes of the space battle were cool - they were heavily influenced by the Battlestar Galactica remake from SyFy with the camera nervosio bit intact. The movie felt small like a TV special, and the payoff was a total letdown. The costumes were cool, and the ships looked great but there was no sense of urgency, and there seemed like the were only 50 people manning the ship. The original cartoon had a ship that looked like it was manned by hundreds and more than 7 fighter planes...sigh. If you loved the anime series - I wouldn't purchase this live action-letdown, I would wait for the new animated Yamato 2199 series that is being released in Japan (and I would think would hit U.S. shores faster than this ham acted clunker did). The 10 minute animated preview I saw was better than the whole live action movie...take my word for it, I've loved anime since the 60's and Yamato before it reached the shores as Star Blazers, so stay away from this one....unless it's on your bucket list, along with being shot out a cannon across the Grand Canyon without a chute.
0345803485|1.0|First of all, let preface this by saying that I have never read erotic romance or Harlequin type books so perhaps my expectations were a little high.  Because this was written by a woman, I thought this would be a book with a great storyline and great sex scenes.  I have always felt that porn doesn't resonate with women as much as it could because it is unrealistic and lacks a good inviting storyline. Based on the interview I saw, I thought this would be different.  I was wrong.  The story is quite banal and repetitive.  If you read the back cover, then you can skip the first 150-200 pages as nothing will touch you. The storyline is that typical over the top fantasy that is completely unrealistic.  I saw every scene coming.  The sex scenes are alright but there was all this talk of domineering and they really didn't even do that much in the dominatrix Room of Pain. There was more sex in other places: his bed, her bed, his desk, his family boathouse--which were okay. There were two choices for an ending--one that is incredibly boring and one that is less so.  In light of the fact that it is a trilogy she did pick the less boring ending but you can definitely see it coming.  It was not a cliff hanger at all.  If you want a good story, read something else.  There are many more stories that will resonate with you.  If you want good sex scenes, again I would say read something else--something shorter.  There is no need to waste the time it takes to read 500 pages when you could just read a short story that does the same thing.
0345803485|1.0|Mine not the brainless heroine's...<br />Within 4 pages I was skimming the text and another ten ignoring the banality and jumping to the point of the hype. Oh dear I wish I hadn't bothered. So badly written and saccharine sweet, it's not the content that makes me squirm, but the embarrasment of buying a book that has such poor style.<br />I also bought the book for a friend in NY via the web - please forgive me, my intentions were honourable (well sort of).<br />My problem now is how to dispose of the book and I bet I'm not the only person with the pang of \\"can I really throw a book in the bin?\\".
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it gives you the feel of what it was like back then. even though having to wait for energy is kinda annoying I still like it.
B007R41E8O|4.0|I would have given this game a five, but the ending left too many questions unanswered. For example: why was there a photo of the main character and his sister on the island?
B0055SWM08|4.0|Beautiful graphics with smooth graphics.  Deceptively simple concept but very challenging to play. I would certainly recommend purchasing this game
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this app on every mobile device in our home.  The translation options are great and the reading plans make it easy to keep up with your goals.  I think this is the best mobile app available!
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|These are absolutely perfect for my little princess. They were so easy to put up and all the extra details for each princess are great. I just know she is going to love this as it is something that will grow with her.
B0055SWM08|4.0|game is really stable which is nice that your phone isn't freezing constantly. puzzles are complex enough that game play is in the range of hours.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved the way this book took you inside the world of Nazi Germany, showing you that not all Nazis are bad. I loved the struggle and the jokes. It was really interesting how \\"death\\" shows how in war no one really wins. i wish that it had ended differently though. i wish ***********SPOILER ALERT************ that Rudy, Papa and Mama hadn't died, and if anything I wish Rudy could have gotten his kiss when he was still alive. This book seems to show you that WWII was not only sad and painful for those in concentration camps, but also for other people who have done nothing to deserve their fate.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was completely taken in by the store line of Christain and Ana.  His dominant life style and attitude, had me completely compelled to find out the answers to why he was so disturbed to have this form of submisive lifestyle.  I finished all three books within a week.  I literally couldn't put them down.  The writing style, was  not the best as far as descriptive details, but if you need an easy read with a great story line, this is the one for you. Honestly this is one of the few books I would read again, and again.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|important for bussiness andd the services are better and better ! i like it! the sync is good! the pad edition is useful
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun game to play.  puzzles are great and most are challenging.  either way time goes by while playing and is addictive.
B0055SWM08|5.0|When this app became the free app of the day, I jumped on it thinking it would be good because it always topped the top rated apps list. I was right. The game is fun and challenging and the graphics are awesome. This is one of the best games I have.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really cool because you can pick your own game out of over 100s of games so j think this is an awesome game to get for everyone plus its FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002H97|3.0|Please correct me if I am wrong but if memory serves wasn't the BLACK ALBUM originally called SMELL THE GLOVE?
B007SYWFRM|5.0|So far so good! Great app. Your kids will love it. Our family love the movies. My grandchildren will have fun with this one!
030788743X|4.0|It's like Hunger Games meets Charlie and the Chocolate Factory but set in Second Life.  If you were a fan of comic books, video games, and general nerdery in the 80's you'll love this book! If you were born in 1980 like me and really missed that decade growing up, it's still a really interesting story that will capture your attention and won't let go.<br /><br />Deducting a star because I REALLY wanted more of at the end. Or a prologue. Something! I need more!
B003Y5H5FG|1.0|Fright Night in the 80s was and is one of my alltime favorite movies.  In this I expected something similar to the original.  There was nothing except the names of the people in the movie.  Chris Sarandon does a cameo appearance and I was shocked to see that he would even grace such a poor movie.  In the original, Chris Sarandon's Jerry Dandridge was calm, collected, stunningly sexy, witty, and just brilliant.  In this one, Collin Ferrell is sexy and that's about it.  He also comes off as some little punky jerk, not a 400-year-old vampire.  He seems to be more into porn instead of the sexiness that in everything I have seen and read usually accompanies vampires.  I was gravely disappointed in this.  It needed its own title, because to me this was not a remake.  There was nothing similar.  Peter Vincent in this one was fun and cool unlike the scared, older Peter Vincent in the first one.  In fact, the actor playing Peter Vincent in this one was the saving factor for this movie keeping it from being a total disaster.  If you read all my reviews, I usually only provide a review if it is really good, but this one was so disappointing that I felt I should provide my input in the midst of all the people who have not seen the original.  The original has a storyline... and it's awesome.  This one doesn't even make a lot of sense and the story doesn't even seem to go anywhere.  I think also they are trying so hard to \\"modernize\\" it that they lose sight of what a vampire story is all about.  I'm glad I borrowed this because I would have been sick to have put out money for this movie.  I would not recommend this to anyone who loved the original.  Or really for that matter to anyone who loves vampires because this isn't much of a vampire movie.  Mostly just gore.
030758836X|5.0|In this clever mystery, Flynn explores how women have lost out in our current culture. Amy ends up vanishing, physically as well as emotionally, subsumed into presenting a false front to the man she wants.<br /><br />Amy knew Nick wanted a \\"Cool Girl...hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes...while somehow maintaining a size 2...Cool Girls are above all hot\\" (p 222).<br /><br />This is today's pinup. The bawdy equal of men in every way.<br /><br />Amy complains she \\"waited patiently--years--for the pendulum to swing the other way, for men to start reading Jane Austen...But it never happened. Instead, women across the nation colluded in our degradation! Pretty soon Cool Girl became the standard girl. Men believed she existed...Every girl was supposed to be this girl\\" (p 223).<br /><br />What Amy wanted was love. Mr. Darcy.<br /><br />The sheer misery of most women today has been recounted by study after study. They all show a dramatic decline in the level of female happiness over the last 50 years. Romantic want in a time of sexual plenty. Women complain they have somehow missed their chance at love, in a world where only love brings happiness.<br /><br />To the extent Amy can conceive of right and wrong, she views things as right or wrong in terms of cool. Never in morals, of course. But as one of the honored members of the chattering class from Manhattan--you have achieved the highest status possible if you are a writer, irregardless of the fact that writers are no longer needed--Amy is horrified to recount the lack of cool in fly-over country. Amy shudders to relay that she was served \\"little fried things and drank cocktails made from ice cream\\" (p 96). You can almost hear the revulsion throb through her at the possibility of \\"chicken Frito casseroles\\" (p 96).<br /><br />Chicken Frito casserole? Can anything be more...wrong?<br /><br />Clever writing and a book that works on many different levels.
0345803485|5.0|What can I say? I am a 33 year old mom of three who enjoys reading as a past time. The Twilight series left me wanting the \\"adult\\" side of the story. This book delievered in every area that I look for in a book. The details were so well thought out and was easy for me to have a detailed visual throughout reading. The BDSM is off the charts, adding that to the emotion both are feeling makes this one captivating read. A page turner which I could not set down and read in a little over a day.<br /><br />This book is so much more than erotic play it is a true love story that deep down creates a pang in every woman or man who reads it, wanting more.<br /><br />I have read the trilogy not once but twice and am anticipating a moive release. Brilliantly written and executed, I would love to read a book released through Christian's view ;)<br /><br />A must read if not only for a great love story but maybe to spice something up in your life and try something that is new to you. Or at least now have a perspective on why people may choose to live outside of the box in their relationship.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|You just can't find good action apps like this one. classic. I am always looking for an easy to use obstacle game and this is it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|very intense book! had a hard time putting it down and finished it in a day. cant wait to read book 2
B004EFYZ1C|2.0|used to love this on my Xoom until the ice cream sandwich update, now the moon live wallpaper locks the xoom up constantly
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This item popped up in my recommendations list, seemingly out of nowhere. I have been wary so far to buy books from authors that were unknown to me: I have had a few disappointing experiences in that regard.<br />However, the Wool omnibus came as a pleasant surprise. I googled the author, read a few independant reviews and what was being said about the themes and setting.<br />As far as I am concerned, the themes and setting are what I was looking for: a great post apocalyptic story with a nice background, well formed characters and a nice plot. Furthermore, it is well written in a seemingly easy style that supports a classical construction.<br />The last two parts are, in my opinion, a little weak when compared to the great first three. But, even though, they are more than just good.<br />All in all, this is a most excellent surprise that leaves me wanting for more.
B007PTJOV0|2.0|People who say they like it are ver easily amused, i couldn't play it because it was just to boring, my attention kept drifting, and its is easy for the most part, i just finished the frist level and i did not want to keep playing, if you are one of the people who can be amused easier than me, it would be a good game for you, i really don't like how its a mario clone and its is very lacking of mario gaming, its just incomplete for gaming, the funny part is when i am writing this my attention hasn't drifted once, writing this is more fun than playing this game...
B007PTJOV0|4.0|This game was good but if you lose all your lives then they make you restart the GAME instead  of restarting the level. If they were copying Mario they there would be tubes that transfer you from one place to another. Over all I guess this is a fun OK game.nIt just gets a little fustrating at times. So I guess if your looking for a kinda hard kinda easy game then I guess get  this game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is the best game ever build a village! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !!
B00005JLEU|5.0|I had first seen this movie on the Cartoon network & fell in love with it!  This movie is a real trip - definitely different!  There's a lot of weirdness to the story, but it's very enjoyable to watch.  I highly recommend it!
B000VAQX0A|2.0|This review refers only to the MFSL gold disc release.<br /><br />There are some MFSL releases out there that, in my opinion, warrant the high price tag. But this isn't one of them. The sound is fine, but I didn't find it to be notably better than other versions of this album I've heard. On top of that, there is a good amount of hard limiting, particularly on the first two songs and the final song. Rush in particular is a band that benefits from lots of dynamic range, and it's baffling why an outfit in the business of producing audiophile releases would sabotage the final product by cutting the dynamic range down in order to make the CD louder.<br /><br />Steer clear of this one.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|It was fun until the timer is broken.  Takes days for a 30 minute project.  Not worth the aggravation to play.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Act of Valor is a great movie and not just because I was in the military as a Army Medic, but as a fan and patriot of our special forces. I have a video from Amazon about a SEAL class and also have books I read on other special forces. My favorite part of the movie was when the SWCC teams (Special Warfare Combatant-crew) come and lead the SEALS out with the fire power was extraordinaire. The part that was a surprise is when the SEAL jumped on the grenade in the warehouse to save the other SEALS. Whoever picks these men apart because supposedly their acting is not great need to get a grip on reality, THESE GUYS ARE SEALS, NOT ACTORS! I think they do a terrific job and most of the missions/scenarios that were portrayed were accurate and definitely could happen. I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE FOR ANY action junky or who just enjoy realistic or military movies. I STAND UP AND SALUTE OUR WARRIORS AT HOME AND ABROAD....
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|The game was very fun at first.  Quick to get energy, but after about 10 levels, it takes forever to get energy.  Sometimes it will not even give me energy after not bent on the game for an hour or so!  I had to force close it seelveral times and now woke of my homes are taking over 100 hours to give me the 100 or so coins.  If they do not fix these things, I will have to uninstall.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|I did not love this book, and I am a huge NS fan. I felt this was more predictable than usual. I like how his writing is something you can see happening, that it is realistic, and this book has too much other-worldly stuff that I cannot see it happening in reality. It was well written, just blah and unrealistic. And some of the imagery seemed to take from previous books he has written.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed reading it. It was an easy read, and I got to escape from my daily life for a few hours. I just did not love this book like I love some of the others.
B005HSL626|5.0|its soo fun. I think its funny that were cutting fruit. but it is really fun so you should get this app. o and its ok to get it for you kindle fire if you want to know if its going to make it bad. its not going to do anything. its safe. lol!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A very additive book. I really enjoyed reading this one & went onto read the other 2 books in the trilogy.<br />I couldn't put them down & was so disappointed when I had finished them all. I hope this author writes more.<br />It makes it easy buying from amazon especially the kindle versions, you can have your book at the click of a button.<br />Well done.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like it but I don't like it that It wont let me go to friends. other than that yes its a cute little game.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good fun.... energy does go by pretty quick..so you need to think things thru when planning your town....and also you have to be patient if you don't want to pay for anymore energy...
B004UID2LC|4.0|This is a amazing app its just youtube how could anybody give this app a 1 star. This app can be useful if ur doing to many things online and its different than going online it will mark what you were on the other day so downloud this app NOW enjoy!
B004HNTER6|1.0|The DVD is of such horrible quality we will not even watch it. Can't wait to get a good copy to review the content.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app because there are solo many different games in one! its almost like having a folder for games instead of having them all in one.. YAY
B006KX3GXO|3.0|ONLY 4 DESIGNING PICS!!!!!! that was one of the biggest reason I did NOT like it!!!! otherwise it was a good app to use
B007SSDS24|4.0|The beginning of the movie avoided the typically formulaic setup to invasion or disaster movies, keeping the viewer interested and caring about the protagonists.  The post-invasion world was done well, and the physics behind everything was not so unbelievable (as it tends to be in some movies).  If you watch the movie for what it is, it will be quite enjoyable.
B0055SWM08|5.0|really well made fun puzzle delight worth owning and buying beautiful graphics and music that just makes ur day!!! get itttttt
B0059XTV4Y|1.0|I guess if you have King George The Third's death being announced in 1936(sic) and Nazi affiliations written of by the talentless director as \\"empirical lies\\" then you really are thick. Be it personal interpretation or straight bio pic-open a book and at least get basic history straight. Are there any words that elicit more revulsion when trying to pick a film' to watch than \\"A Film By Madonna\\" ? I listened to her explanation of what the film was about at a press conference' and I am' now' convinced that Madonna is stupid. She can barely string a sentence together and should stop inflicting her failed vanity project films on the world. She seems to think an affected English accent and penchant for film-making will make her appear clever when the opposite is true!! Sad , poorly scripted film and a waste of time and money. Angelina Jolie's film \\"The Land of Blood and Honey\\" is far superior but it received barely any attention yet when Jolie is criticized for being a novice she and her fans are not crying out \\"victim\\". First madonna is not a \\"victim\\" because she can't direct, can't write and won't take acting lessons. W.E. is one of the worst films I've ever seen-it was murky and lame.Madonna spent almost USD$40 million (or $20 million British pounds) to make essentially a love letter to a bunch of royals and fashion victims with' Nazi sympathies and in some cases PROVEN COLLABORATIONS which she claims are \\"libel\\"(sic). Just when you thought her career couldn't get anymore vile, here it is.
B007TMON8M|5.0|Love this game! I play it all the time. Some levels are easier than others but they are all fun!
B005LAJ23A|1.0|I'd like to start by saying that I read the comic this show is based off, and I don't want to end up sounding like I'm just mad because the show isn't like the comic in anything but the most basic of ways.  I love the comic, and only found out about it when I heard that AMC was making this show.  That's about the end of me love affair with the television version of The Walking Dead.  Season one was okay, but a bit to short to really get a feel for where the show was going, and now that I've seen season two, I can say its in the wrong direction.<br /><br />**You may find some indirect spoilers in here.  This review is more intended for a person who has watched the season but not yet purchased the box sets.**<br /><br />I will never understand the obsession with taking a well written piece of work and adding in all these preset equations for how people interact and amping up the level of drama to points where I think a person might just flat out die of heart failure if they ever acted with such intensity.  You don't need people flying off the handle over nothing, and going from one extreme for good entertainment.  In fact, I personally feel that having characters with a more balanced basis of personality goes for more realistic writing.  In life, you don't have \\"good guys\\" and \\"bad guys\\", you just have people doing what they think is right to get what they deserve, and even if someone may be portrayed as an antagonist in the comic, they were always shown to have there own understandable reasons for there actions in these situations.  All I see in this show is people flying off the handle over every little thing, getting into well timed but pointless car crashes, and puking up abortion pills about eight seconds after taking them.  Most of these characters don't have a personality, they're just a walking pile of drama waiting to explode on the nearest thing that could possibly set them off.<br /><br />Aside from just being walking piles of drama, I don't find the characters to be all that logical in how they operate.  I'm gonna put this one in a nice list for you:<br /><br />1. Parental Supervision- Exactly how many times does Carl have to sneak out to almost get eaten by zombies before you keep an eye on him?  This is the zombie apocalypse, not the state fair.  He'll get eaten at some point if you don't keep an eye on him.<br />2. CDC Anyone?- Hey, do you guys remember that episode where they went to the CDC?  They met this guy who told them zombies are dead dead, and that they're not going to wake up and be magically better the next day?  Rick might have wanted to mention that to Hershel at some point.<br />3. Driving School- Road maps + Zombies + Panicking = Not good.  I get the point was the be a lure to make you want to watch the next episode to find out if she was going to be horribly killed, which amazingly she wasn't (surprise!), but at least use a little common sense next time you go out driving in the zombie apocalypse.<br />4. Sophia- That entire thing was just horrible.  A 12 year old girl isn't going to last very long out in the woods.  I can't really say what was less intelligent.  Her running away when she was told not to, or them assuming she was still alive after like a week alone.<br />5. Dale's RV- This may be more of a season one critique in some areas, but was it the best idea to go driving around in an RV with a busted radiator hose?  Couldn't have found maybe another vehicle somewhere along the way?<br />6. Andrea- I just have to say that everything this woman does makes about as much sense as well, zombies do.  Andrea has two feelings.  Emo, and RAGE.  In rare instances, she can combine the two into EmoRAGE where she tries to talk members of the group into applauding teenage suicide.  There are to many individual instances to list, but the entire character of Andrea in the show makes so little sense to me I can't even rationalize it all.<br /><br />Now, to anyone who is going to say that people aren't always going to do the logical thing, and that stress can be a factor which would increase drama and irrationality I have to say that to a point, I agree with that.  The difference I'm trying to point out is that if they really constantly acted irrationally, like these people always do, then they'd probably have ended up dead already.<br /><br />Another thing that gets me about this season is that they're trying to rush to many themes that appear later on in the comic into the show to early.  I'm not sure if this is to try to keep the interest of comic readers or what, but the show is just moving to fast.  Rick is a character who has, and continues to go through a very long and hard moral change.  He does his best to hold onto the values he had in pre-apocalypse life, but will do whatever it takes to protect his family.  This evolution is cut down from the course of over a year to the course of a few weeks, where Rick seems to go instantly from law-enforcing family man to sociopathic killer, ready to shoot anyone who even looks at him a little wrong.  The change happening over a longer period of time really makes you empathize with Rick more, while the change in the show only makes me question his sanity.<br /><br />In addition to rushing the themes of characters it seems that just the show itself is rushed.  Characters are being killed of at a rapid rate that survive for much longer, leaving a lot of plot holes for how the show could have an resemblance to the comic in the future.  An entire family thus far was never introduced.  A lot of the character evolution is based on who you have to interact with, and with cutting these characters out or just killing them off so early, you cut out the potential for that same interaction to be brought up in the show.  I'm aware that the show isn't meant to be a copy of the comic, but at least holding to a bit more of the character interactions than just being in the same location once in a while could be nice.  Even the few scenesthat are kept similar to the comic are so blown out of proportion with drama and craziness that they just end up being ruined.<br /><br />The last thing I have to say, which I think is the culmination of pretty much all I've said up to now, is that this show just isn't what Robert Kirkman claims his writing style to be.  Kirkman writes to be realistic.  He tries to figure out how something would work, how someone would act, and then he does his best to deliver that in an entertaining way.  I get that in writing things can't always be 100% realistic, like zombies walking around for example, but trying to keep to that style is what I love about the comic the most.  A lot of the things that happen you really don't see coming, and that's what really makes empathize with the characters and enjoy the story.  All I have to say after watching how these people act in season two, I'm going to start rooting for the zombies.
0307887960|5.0|This book has a great diet that is sound and safe.  There is also good exercise information and encouragement.  Great book!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|wish it had narration for more translations. the NASB narration disappeared for some reason. minor occasional bugs, but besides that it's a great app.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|it is nothing like the other games the birds have different powers it is so worth money buy it now
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Still playable with the crashes. I would give 5 stars instead of 4 if it didn't have this problem. Well paced gamer.
0756405890|5.0|This story and the sequel, A Wise Man's Fear, is one of the best stories I have read in a long, long time. Can't wait for book 3.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this game is so much fun. it is easy to play; lots of fun; and great for long road trips. will keep you busy for hours. worth the money.
B00753MBHA|5.0|I LOVED Blood of the Nations and had high hopes for this one, but like with many sequels, the expectation was that it would fall short.  Happily, I was WRONG!  What a great follow-up by a band I have followed since the early 80's.  Blood gave me chills and a sore neck (from head-bangin') and this album is just as rewarding...glad I pre-ordered it because it freakin' rocks!  Too bad that I just cut off so much of my hair because I have the desire to swing it around to Stalingrad, but at least my neck will not suffer (too much ;-)
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I can never find a flashlight or if I do the batteries are dead.  I have used my kindle fire twice now, just being turned on,  as a flashlight,  like when I had to go out to the backyard at night.  So I decided to download a flashlight app just for the heck of it.  This one works in many colors just in case I feel like I need a certain<br />color to see,  ha ha.  I suppose it could be a source of entertainment when the power goes out.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is a lot of fun. I liked this game from the first minute! The characters are really cute - just like in the movie.
B005ORVMT2|5.0|The best old school Rush concert footage! Footage from concerts from the mid to late 80's.  The original Rush hits which took them to another level!  Good stuff!
B000VIPJKM|5.0|Reese Witherspoon transforms into Elle woods and makes this movie a huge hit. If you just want to get away from your life for less then a couple of hours. Or if you Need a break or just want something fun. Legally Blonde is a Prefect fun filled movie. Reese is not only beautiful, she rocks this role and becomes Elle Woods one of the best characters ever created on screen.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is the best game in the world but don't take it from me because I didn't actually okay or get the game
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It describes how Jake Epping goes back in time to save JFK. It is VERY intense with tons of action scenes and twists. It does contian cursing and some adult content, but it is not extreme in innapropiate content; it does not detract from the story. I love this book because it mixes realistic fiction, so it feels like if happened recently, with historical fiction and a bit of a sci-fi twist.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|I first heard Joe on a PBS program and had to get the Albert Hall concert dvd. Got on the email and had to get Dust Bowl cd.  Recently got the Beacon Theater concert dvd BEFORE it was on PBS.  Now, I've pre-ordered the next installment \\"Driving Towards the Daylight\\".  If I only could have one album in my collection, impossible!, this would be it.  I range from Brian Eno to John Fogerty, and from classical to musicals.  I'm a music affecionado, so I can only agree with the descriptions and praises I've read here. Anyone who loves this liquid blues rock would enjoy Joe's website, lots going on.  He loves to share about his girls, his guitars.  I missed the concert here in Oakland at the restored Fox, but hope some day to have good enough health to see him and be with other fans.  He is absolutely a genius through incredible hard work and love for his craft.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Reader 10.2 is pretty awesome and includes commenting and form filling. You can even draw your signature.<br /><br />No more print then sign.

B004JN1D2I|4.0|That´s pretty much what I have to say: George captures the eternal traces of human behavior, concocts a fantasy scenario with lots of struggle for power and links all that in a strongly paced story.<br />If you were paying attention, yes, the story line is great, the scenarios, hardships, intrigues and peoples in these novels (or should I say \\"humongous novel\\") are of fine quality and so on.<br /><br />But that is just a minor thing to the value of his work.<br /><br />The real value of George's rendition of his views on human nature is that we may consider it \\"high fidelity\\".<br /><br />There are the emotions, sentiments, rages, ambitions, calculations and egotism, lust, naïve and childish behaviors and options, mistakes and successes, suffering and false hopes and so on - more so in theses novels than anywhere else one reads nowadays - but that is not what sets George Martin from all the others. It's something great, something really \\"in tune\\" with reality, something that I might consider genius-like.<br /><br />Gorge Martin gives you a hero, from a hero in the making to a mature and directed person, coaches the person through hardships and victories - only to let the bugger succumb to his childish desires, immaturity, lust or misplaced trust and, with the hero-to-be, a whole nation or people succumbs. Isn't this reality?... Furthermore, you see good sides and bad sides in all the factions that fight for power (or mere survival) in this fine work - and so more rightly so as they are composed of people with conflicting traits.<br /><br />It's the capacity to tell a story whose mind-grabbing feature is an ambiance of fantasy, yet populating it with real, true to life people, whose story is so tied to success and failure as in real life, and - above all else - the capacity to resist the \\"good guys vs. bad guys\\" and \\"psychotic hero\\" trends (I'll explain this one, if you have any doubts). OK, so it's all a novel - but real people live in there. In my book, where there are no saints and no demons, but a bit of each in everyone, George Martin got this one right.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, great reading!...
B0055SWM08|5.0|quells music is amazing grafics amazing and its a raindrops its awesome. the puzzle are hardly simple and simply hard. this game is outstanding.<br />I really want to get the second one
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is similar to Frontierville on Facebook.  I love how you can go fishing for food and do other things you would need to do to survive if in this situation in real life.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I haven't read the second or third book but from the movie trailer it instantly yelled Battle Royale in my ear.  I read the book and watched the movie and my verdict is final, it's a more elaborate version of Koushun Takami's Battle Royale.  The series goes let's take a high school math class or whatever, stick them on an island with bombs strapped to them that will explode if they try to escape, take it off, or if there is no winner after 48 hours and force them to kill each other with whatever supplies thy find lying around the island.  Being a Japanese movie, it was more gruesome the hunger games and it ends with two winners too, can you guess, a young couple that fell in love and beat the system.  I'm not saying the Hunger Games isn't worth a look see, people say Avatar was a copy of Pocahontas but that didn't deter from it being a good movie/book.
B002APS61I|5.0|This is a classic story. With a classic performance by Keira Knightley.  She blends the drama, humor, romance and intelligence that this character embodies. And she does it with beauty and grace!  Her best performance in her career!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|amazing game it makes me feel like a real restuarant owner which sets a good example for our future again I like the app thnx
B007SSDS24|3.0|My wife and I like to see alien movies.  Darkest Hour is more understandable than Cowboys vs Aliens, and the characters are more likeable than Skyline.  The steady camera work also makes it less of a nausea fest than Cloverfield.  The movie is entertaining, even though it has a few tropes.<br /><br />Unfortunately most of the time in Darkest Hour is consumed by the heroes running from glowing shadowy angel things.  All the running really showcases how nicely Moscow is filmed.  Oddly the movie takes the heroes through all the famous tourist spots in Moscow.  A nightclub, the highway, Red square, The Kremlin, Moscow GUM(mall), the US Embassy and the famous metro are all setpieces.  Perhaps without all the shadowy ghostly things, all of these places in Moscow would be fun to see.<br /><br />If you are looking for over the top violence, sex, or drama, there is none here.  That isn't the fault of the young and unknown actors and actresses, its because you can't really script a movie about running from invisible angel things.  The movie has more Deus Ex Machina than the average Star Trek: The Next Generation episode. It's a better movie than Cloverfield but it is begging for some closure.<br /><br />Close your eyes and imagine Ghost Busters vs Pikachu. If that vision makes you smile, rent the movie!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Amazing!!!!!!! Accept there should be more enemies such as bees or rabid squirrels. And ma eye Leper can get temperary powers like lucky jumps and rainbow flight.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good game to kill time with its a little different to get used to be I'm getting it now overall a great game
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Cute game that brings back a lot of good childhood memories of me and my friends playing the NES back on Barclay Ave.<br />The price is good too!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|absolutely awesome app its so entertaining you can raise so many families and the scratch kung fu mini game is also awesome. keeps me entertained all the time.

B005MQW5RI|5.0|Read great reviews about the movie and wasn't disappointed. Recommended viewing for all ages, great in 3D would love to enjoy other similar movies.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I am absolutely enchanted by these Quell games and can play them for hours. I really enjoy that the developers offered a tiny behind-the-scenes look at the history of this series. As with the first one, the music, art, and gameplay are all wonderfully beautiful. Very relaxing and well worth the price!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game I got it and within a hour or two got to level 6 the levels can be tricky and involve some waiting but that's what makes it fun!
B003HARV3Y|2.0|I was in love with this book but SO disappointed in the movie.  I was cringing the entire time.  They really dumbed down the Greek Mythology and changed the entire story to appease people that wouldn't have been willing to follow the original plot.  Grover's character had a completely different personality and his cheesy little one-liners could have been stolen from your typical Disney or Dreamworks movie about talking animals from a variety of ethnic backgrounds.  I think the books have enough of a following that this movie would have made plenty of money without selling out this way but whoever made it did not have enough faith in the Percy Jackson fans.  And why are they in high school??  He was supposed to be 12.  They thought having good looking teen actors would be better than young kids.  I guess they weren't worried about what age he would be in the sequels, if they even bother to make them after this atrocity.  Maybe they were trying to make it more \\"hip\\" than Harry Potter, but I've got news for them: If they had just told the story as it was and had younger kids grow up in these roles it absolutely would have been better than Harry Potter.  No contest.  But instead they RUINED it.  I should have known it would suck when it was bargain priced on Zune.  I won't give up on the series though, because the books are so awesome.  Maybe someday someone else will come along and make a movie worthy of the stories.
0792839692|5.0|For fans of the movie, the 8 page booklet that came with the 1998 release contains the following: page 1 title page; p2 photo endpaper; p3 Letter From The Director on the theme of \\"Sanctuary\\"; p4/5 Riding The Carousel with more technical development details; p6 20th Century Movie Magic with paragraphs on the domed miniature, Stickmen dissolving the runner's corpse, decayed Washington DC, holograph interrogation, laser lighting during city destruction, and cast list; p7 A Glimpse Into The Future with paragraphs on Texas locations, Logan's apartment, ice cave set, and California sewage disposal plant location; p8 Scene Selections track list.  This information does add to what is said in the commentary and contemporary featurette.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|this is a great Bible app.  You can use your favorite version, most you can download and use offline.  The number of reading plans can keep you reading the Bible for years.  great on both htc evo and kindle fire.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|love this, had it forever and still play it almost every day. sometimes crashes when I try to continue a game otherwise it would have gotten 5 stars
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great game like Mario on a shamrock high. awesome graphics and the controls work very well. would definitely recommend this game
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Can a movie made with marionettes make a strong social commentary? Sure can...<br /><br />These guys leave no group untouched. Liberal are hammered. Conservatives are flattened. American arrogance is brought to the foreground with pride!<br /><br />The story of America's \\"world police\\" is peppered with displays of the ignorance of people of all sorts; gays, Americans, actors, women, men, middle-easterners, North Korea, etc...<br /><br />At first, the marionettes were a \\"red flag\\" for me, but as soon as I saw preview of the puking scene (Gary outside of the bar), I relaized that I had to see the movie. Very, very funny throughout with biting, acrid humour. Some filth, some wonderfully stupid profanity, full marionette nudity, zany dialogs, and you have a fun film. Humour of the highest caliber, IMHO.<br /><br />Highly recommended movie!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|One of te best love stories I've read!! Forget what all the Negative Nelly's have to say and give it a try. E L James is a phenomenal writer, the books are very compelling. I couldn't put them down! I know a lot of others who are reading or have read this trilogy and they all say the same thing!! I fell head over heels for Anastasia and Christian (oh who am I kidding, for all of Grey/Steele clan!) what a phenomenal love story she created...I absolutley loved everythjng about these books, the emails between Christian and Anastasia, her inner goddess, Fifty's transformation, the suspenseful twists, the passion (WOW!!), the list goes on and on... Oh an the the extras at the end of book three, such a wonderful treat!
B00005614M|5.0|The quality of the music on this if very fine - the true roots of hard bop are clearly at hand! This is certainly NOT elevator music (as one reviewer states it) and is nearly a must for jazz fans. The playing is competent and inspired throughout. The sound is acceptable - not much can be done about the original recordings, which were not of the best quality. You do not buy this recording for the audio quality, you buy it for the priveledge of listening to one of the most influential performances of the post-bop jazz style.<br /><br />This really is not to be missed - highly recommended!
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|Saw this movie when it was originally shown in theatres.  Critics at the time gave it lukewarm to negative reviews.  Was not a blockbuster which was unfortunate.  The performances of Hines and Baryshnikov alone were worth seeing this movie.  It was interesting to see Gregory and Mishka dance in their own styles and then see them meld their styles of dance (ballet and tap) when they performed together.  The story was intense and kept me on the edge of my seat even though at had seen it before and knew the ending.<br /><br />The commentary on the making of White Nights was interesting.  I always wondered how they were able to film in Soviet Russia and how they were able to get Baryshnikov there and most importantly out again since he actually defected from the Soviet Union.  (I won't spoil it for you).  The scenes of the Soviet Union as it was at the time were fascinating.  This is definitely one for your collection.
B00000IL26|5.0|Very interesting recording with a very clean and wide sound. If I understand correctly, this was THE recording that saved a struggling Blue Note records when it was released.<br /><br />Every song is a winner on this recording. Morgan is an excellent soloist, on par with any one you could mention... incuding Miles Davis! Morgan's style is a bit \\"cleaner\\" than Davis' and I find it quite attractive sounding. Not better than Davis, but different and very worthwhile to have in your jazz collection. This is just a complete winner of a recording - you really cannot go wrong with this one. A great follow up to Morgan's work with Art Blakely!
B007SSDS24|3.0|It's getting harder and harder to find movies that are original and good at the same time.  This one is a different look of how things may turn out one day... probably not though.  It was difficult at times to stay focused on the movie wondering about what else might be going on... but if you are really bored and nothing else is on tv this movie is barely a good replacement.  Rent at your own risk.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|More so than the [[ASIN:B0055SWM08 first game]] (which I've recently acquired as a FAOTD), this game has some real head-scratching, brain teasers. The hint feature means you're never stymied completely, just until you've given each puzzle every effort you care to.<br /><br />The puzzles have two levels of difficulty, really. First, you have to solve how to get all the pearls (including golden ones). Then once you've discovered that ... you can try to figure out how to do it in the last possible moves. Doing so earns you some \\"hint\\" points that you can cash in later for those puzzles that have you totally stumped. The two challenges built into each puzzle guarantee that you'll have hours of puzzle-solving enjoyment.<br /><br />This is the kind of app I really want. Well rendered, unhurried, not insulting to my intelligence, no ad networks (checked with Lookout Ad Network detector), quiet sounds that won't disturb others.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|the game is awesome but why wait so long to make another level they don't even tell you when it comes out
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Lep's World is a fun game... I liked it and think everyone else will. :D<br />I'm glad I got this app!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love this app. But I would love it more if it were possible earn more tokens and acorn in a more fashionable way instead of buying them or earning them in the game in such way. My wanted to have more tokens to play whaile waiting to attend to the families.  So he can earn more coins or acorns. The tokens are so rare, that's frustrating.  And we both wish there more driffent kind of movies clips too watch. I give it a 4 or 4 1/2. I feel they could have made it a little better.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I decided to read The Hunger Games after seeing it come up as a Kindle best seller on Amazon for quite a while followed by all the hype about the movie. I first got a sample, which I read without ordering, then finally got the book. It is a \\"page turner\\" once you get into it, especially the games themselves. By now I think everyone knows the basics of the plot. The decadent Capitol rules the oppressed colonies and forces the teenagers to engage in mortal combat for entertainment. It is easy to dismiss as unrealistic until you think of regimes such as North Korea that actually starve their citizens. The Romans had the gladiators and we have \\"Survivor\\", so I'm sure Americans would watch the Hunger Games if they existed in our reality. I think that's part of the point that Suzanne Collins is making with the book. People are drawn to violence and competition.  Of course you route for Katniss, the heroine, but mourn the deaths of the other \\"tributes\\". So as not to spoil anything, I will just say that Katniss is wise about some things and naive about others. Overall, I'd recommend the book as a compelling story. Now I'm ready to see the movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really loved the series! It was very thought provoking and allowed for good discussions in my classroom and at home with my own children!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|simple and fun, nicely done. the graphics are good and the levels have enough variety to keep you interested. good for kids and adults alike.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really loved the series! It was very thought provoking and allowed for good discussions in my classroom and at home with my own children!
B0041T52S6|3.0|Every time I watch this movie I LOL, so I finally gave in and decided to buy the DVD.  While usually ordering from Amazon has been nothing but perfect, I was disappointed when my DVD arrived and was clearly loose in the package.  I'm sure Amazon doesn't plastic wrap their own DVDs so they could not have anticipated the DVD being loose inside, but when you can hear it knocking around in the case, that should raise a red flag.  Upon opening the package, I found that the squeezie thing in the middle that holds the DVD in place was broken, thus causing the DVD to roll around and get scratched up.  Fortunately, it wasn't too scratched and not worth returning, but Amazon should pay more attention to this sort of thing.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really loved the series! It was very thought provoking and allowed for good discussions in my classroom and at home with my own children!
0486281523|5.0|I had a TBI and almost died. So I started rehab with a speech therapist (that's a thinking therapist) then with math fact pamphlets for 3-8 year olds. I advanced to this book after a year. It's been 5 years and I still haven't finished it. It's great for learning and reviewing how to think.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. Have not had any problems so far. You will enjoy and if you have kids they will have fun playing also.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is the awesomest game ever!!! I've shown all my friends, and they are addicted too! Get this app, if you don't your missing out!!!
B006W0QOF2|1.0|This movie is so slow.  Not art house pretty story developing slow just slow with no explanation. None of the characters are developed enough for me to even care what happens to them.  I spent most of the movie wishing for all of the main characters to get stabbed in the face, or for the power to go out so I didn't have to finish the movie.  For a movie called drive there are shockingly few scenes that have anything to do with a car.  They should have called the movie stare because most of the movie is several minute long silent close ups of Ryan Goslings idiot character staring off at nothing.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I dislike the energy issue; wait 4ever to get ur energy back or pay real money 4 energy.  Keeps force closing causing everything to reset to 200 hours.  I would have given a 5 if the game didn't have the energy issue.  Kindle Fire Edition.  Updated review -- force close issues and the resetting of everything to 200 hours has been fixed with an update. Updated to 4 stars.  Still not happy about the energy issues.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Love it. Just wish you could earn more acorn's and unlock more things without paying with acorn's.  Other then that great game.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|on par if not better than other evernote apps. I would really recommend this for first timers too. loads fast, no flaws
B0055SWM08|5.0|great relaxing game. play it on a rainy day with a warm cup of joe for the best experience... haha
B007PTJOV0|5.0|can't believe this is FREE!!! May be a Super Mario rip off but that doesn't deter from the fun had playing.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This app is great for anything to notes at work to a to do list. You can use it for anything to I if you want it get it. It is free you know!!!
