B0009NSE1K|5.0|If you like (Pepper Keenan's) C.O.C., or old Blackfoot, or Black Sabbath, you will love this record.  Do not hesitiate,just buy it.  They are unique; I simply mention those other bands as a reference point musically (although Clutch does not sound like any particular one of them, they truly created their own sound!).  Chock full of incredible riffage and fantastic lyrics as usual.  After long overlooking them, Clutch has become my new favorite band, thanks to their unflinching dedication and musicianship.  If you do not know them but like hard rock with attitude and yes--humor, buy this and just pres PLAY.  :headbanger: <br />
0440241030|4.0|It is very refreshing to read a mystery book that is well written and well thought-out and not just a generic toughguy slapped onto a page and published.  Lee Child's Reacher is an ex-military police officer and he uses his training to solve mysteries and help people in his civilian life.  This is a great concept and doesn't delve into the oft-used \\"special forces\\" soldier concept. <br /> <br />This book finds Reacher looking for a mercenary's kidnapped wife.  Since the merc is not being as helpful as possible, Jack has to do things \\"The Hard Way\\". <br /> <br />Like the previous Reacher novel I have read, the plot in this one is a bit slow-paced, but so well constructed that you hardly even notice it. <br /> <br />The characters are all well drawn and seem to develop nicely over the course of the novel. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a nice detective novel, with a helping of danger, this will definatly fit the bill.

1881273156|5.0|Chapman drives home the point that sometimes the way that you express love is not the way that the other person *feels* love. This book explains the importance of showing love in different ways to different people. My husband understood these principals when he was courting me, and to this day I never question that he loves me.  <br /> <br />You need this book!

B000BYA5GO|3.0|If you watch this movie taking this movie as it is intended to be taken a \\"black comedy\\" then you should enjoy it. Cage is great and the story is interesting. Some very cool visual effects are used in this good,but embellished story. Much better than I expected.
B000EMGJM2|5.0|I don't know what I put before to win over 4 people's votes with my 3.5 star rating but I have grown to love this disc the most out of all of Van's. Almost every song is really great and the sound on the album is just eclectic goodness. The lyrics are very sharp and descriptive here. Some of my favorites are \\"Hole In My Heart\\", \\"Suspicion (She Knows Me Too Well)\\", \\"Character\\", \\"Being A Girl\\", \\"Hot Stage Lights\\", \\"The Thrill Of This Love\\" and \\"Mean Sleep\\".<br /><br />I know this review isn't very long but that's cause I sadly don't have the time to go on and on about my favorite Van Hunt album. But just know that it is rich and varied in sound. Some of it dabbles in sounds of the past and there is a mix of R&B, Soul, Rock and some kind of Dance on \\"At The End Of A Slow Dance\\".<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />4.8 stars.

0618680004|4.0|This book is difficult to put down.  But does it really impart enough information to merit the time?  At times, I wondered.  To be fair to Dawkins, he teaches the reader a few new terms:<br /><br />--HADD (hyperactive agent detection device) is the tendency to attribute human motives to machines.<br /><br />--Polyamory is \\"the belief that one can simultaneouslylove severalmembers of theopposite sex.\\"<br /><br />--The Potlatch effect is the custom of providing for another person in order to assert one's own superiority over that person.<br /><br />--Zeitgeist is defined as \\"the spirit of the times.\\"  The term refers to a social change in different parts of the world at about the same time.  Dawkins gives the example of women's lib.<br /><br />On the whole, however, Dawkins does not give much information to back up his claims.  He promises to prove the non-existence of God, but then doesn't.  He also denounces the notion of \\"irreducible complexity\\" as baloney, so I was all prepared for him to refute Michael Behe's book point by point, which he doesn't.<br /><br />As G. Merritt said, Dawkins is truly \\"preaching to the choir.\\"
B000I0QKDS|5.0|The late sixties produced some of the best music ever. Many masterpieces are overlooked these days, and this is certainly one of them. Anyone who appreciates the blues and folk based music of the period will enjoy this album. They will also be shocked to discover that Rod Stewart is the singer! The other treat is Nicky Hopkins on keyboards - he later went on to influence the Rolling Stones and Jeffeson Airplane sounds.  <br /> <br />In a nutshell many people owe a debt to this album, and the musicians involved. it has pride of place in my extensive collection. <br /> <br />Just a word of warning - if you are looking for pop - it won't be for you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002L5P|5.0|I'm not a kid, and I'm not a music reviewer. But the soundtrack of my collegiate life -- and even on into my middle-aged life now -- was dominated by The Smiths and Morrissey. (And just to gloat, I got to see Morrissey in concert Friday at a tiny venue, and it was awesome.)  <br /> <br />I can't recall the first Smiths song I ever heard, but I know who played it for me. My best friend had musical tastes far more wide-ranging than me, and he convinced me to give them a listen. I won't go so far as to say it changed my life, as another reviewer did, but The Smiths' music stunned me with its depth and raw emotion. I acquired one CD of theirs after another, then got Morrissey's solo work, adding each new recording as it came and loading up on imports, bootlegs and singles. <br /> <br />When I went to England, \\"Everyday Is Like Sunday\\" was the song I listened to repeatedly on the flight. And when a break-up with a girlfriend devastated me, I turned to the live version of \\"I Know It's Over\\" from \\"Rank\\" -- and to The Smiths' stark debut album. \\"It's time the tale were told of how you took a child and you made him old.\\" My youthful, angst-ridden, college boy self found no better words to express how I felt. <br /> <br />Now I'm older, happier, married and largely angst-free. But I still love The Smiths and Morrissey's entire canon of work. It is inextricably bound to my memories, and with Morrissey still recording, it promises to go on with me as the future turns into the past. <br /> <br />One reviewer here said there's a dud on every Smiths album. I disagree. Every Smiths song, from the most tortured to the most frivolous, works on an emotional level; you just have to hear it at the right time.
0316018953|5.0|When Harry Bosch gets involved in domestic terrorism, you can be pretty sure that things aren't ever quite what they seem.  <br /> <br />Indeed it is part of the genius of Michael Connelly that he is able to lead you in one direction and move the plot in a completely unseen different direction. When Bosch solves the crime, as he must, you suddenly realize how some of the details mean something you had never imagined. Connelly's greatness may lie in the kind of finesse of plot that makes you hungry for more and not annoyed at the writer.  <br /> <br />At the core of this tale is Bosch. It is classic Bosch-determined, dark, skeptical. to Bosch murder is simply murder even if others want to dress it up and call it another name. And to Bosch murder must be investigated, assumptions must be challenged, biases must be overcome and murderers must be caught. The world according to Bosch doesn't change much-it's violent, jealous, and enraged. Understanding that rather than the bureauspeak of federal agents leads to solving crimes. <br /> <br />So we have a body, Stanley Kent, and a couple of crimes, and the threat of nuclear terrorism. Lesser souls would abdicate the job of homicide investigator and let the feds handle the terrorism and its fallout. Bosch challenges those assumptions so directly that you almost think he is crazy or at least obsessed. But the man who beat back every attempt that Deputy Chief Irving Irving  made to fire him is not intimidated by the suits. His job is as important as theirs, and he lets you and them know it. <br /> <br />And this is why this short novel is a great read.
1591841666|4.0|Let me respond to the few comments about how small and short this book is. They are right and the book is small and short and I read it in 45 minutes on a train. However, the idea and concept is enlightening and thought provoking.<br /><br />I can think of many people around me that can use this book. Seth Godin could probably write a 400 page book on this topic but he chose to present the idea in this format on purpose. Most people are too busy and just don't have the time or inclination to read a 400 page book. They will read an 80 pages booklet and recommend it to their friends.  As for the comment about the concept being \\"obvious\\". The world is full of this stuff. Sometimes it is the simple and obvious stuff that make us stop and \\"think\\" and have the most impact. Kudos to Seth for another good read.
B0000AUHPG|4.0|\\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" is director Sergio Leone's formidable and unique vision of the old west as grand opera.  In Leone's work, as in opera, subtlety is replaced by exaggeration, i.e., the villians in his creation are all over-the-top, almost cartoonishly evil while the ingenue/heroine is both pretty and boring to the extreme.  The movie's musical score, as in opera, is as important or even more important than dialogue in conveying the story.  In fact, words are rarely uttered in this western tale.      I'm not always comfortable with Leone's antagonists and protagonists because the audience never really gets to know or understand them.  They are presented more as abstractions of good and evil than they are as fully developed, three-dimensional human beings.     And Ennio Morricone's idiosyncratic score, while elaborate and memorable, sometimes seemed too languid or pretty to suit the violent action in a western.  But perhaps Morricone was aiming for irony.    Overall, \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" is an unusual and gorgeous- looking western very much worth a glance or two.
0743496728|5.0|This was a GREAT book. I really loved it... it dealed with an issue that all high school kids are familiar with (bullying) and put a whole new spin on it.<br /><br />And plus, the writing was great, I cried (of course), and yet the ending was so satisfying. There are really no words to describe this book. Besides, read it. It's meant for adults, but that didn't stop me from loving it.
B000KCHZK6|1.0|I loved Norah Jones first 2 Cds and awaited the arrival of this offering with  great anticipation. But I guess its just too hard to keep up that level of perfection. Anyway I do not like this CD very much at all. It sounds stale and uninteresting and I think Miss Jones blew it with tis one.
0395645662|4.0|Imagine that you live in a world where everything operates in an orderly fashion and pain, anguish, crime, poverty, hunger, prejudice, racism, sexism and other societal ills have been eliminated. It is just such a society that young 12-year-old Jonas lives and we are given a glimpse into this idyllic community. <br /> <br />The Gift by Lois Lowry opens as Jonas is approaching his twelfth birthday which is also the year of a milestone where the young persons, reaching the age of twelve, enter into adulthood, are given their vocational assignments, and enter into a period of apprenticeship. Jonas is bestowed a great honor when he is selected as the next Receiver of Memory. <br /> <br />Jonas' world quickly turns upside down as he learns that his society, which has totally eliminated individuality and personal choice, is not as perfect as he once thought. <br /> <br />This is a wonderful book and the ending is quite poetic.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|Loved the mood on this album. Different and great. Cant take it out of my stereo
B000MR9D5E|5.0|What stopped us in our tracks during a walkthru of BestBuy was the snow leopards on a 60-inch screen!  We asked what was playing, found out it was Planet Earth, then ordered it the same day.  Amazing photography!
B00000G3PA|1.0|Armageddon ranks up there with one of the absolute worst movies I've had the misfortune of seeing.  It gives new meaning to the phrase 'over the top'.  (Bigger is not better).  Why is it that Hollywood insists on giving 99% of the attention to ridiculous special fx and 1% to the script/writing?  Mega budget blockbusters like Armageddon are the most guilty of misappropriation of resources.  Somebody please make Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer stop ...
B000NA28I4|5.0|A ture adventure in the Dragon and rider style of drama.  It does have a few new twists from other dragon stories.  I really enjoyed it.
B0001L3MI0|1.0|This movie sucked big time.  It was so Over the Top.  One man takes on the galaxy with help from the President and a guy flying a crop duster.  Gimme a break.  Also, this movie sports some of the worst one liners.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|Of the many 'gadgets' that fall under the ASOTV label, I have been most intrigued by the Swivel Sweeper and decided that I just had to have it. <br /> <br />I received it today... and it is impressive! After the initial charge, I ran it through some tests like kitty litter (no sweat), pergo and tile floors (A+), and versatility (very nimble and convenient).  <br /> <br />David S's review is perfect and I echo his sentiment of wondering why there are so many bad reviews. This isn't a replacement for a vacuum cleaner and shouldn't be treated as such. You know what? Neither are the Roomba and the Euro-Pro Shark (by the way, the EPS is also a very good product but not as agile as the SS). <br /> <br />David S also makes a good point that I agree with: the SS is oversold on TV. You will need to clean the brushes frequently. In doing so, I was amazed at how much carpet fuzz this gathered. Furthermore, despite it's on-air claims, this is not a vacuum. It is an electric, cordless floor sweeper meant to be used for the quick clean-ups between major vacuumings. <br /> <br />Here are some recommendations to make the most of this: <br /> <br />* When sweeping, move the SS in an 'S-like' fashion -- much like how they mop in the Navy. This will allow the brushes to push/pull/spin at the utmost advantage for cleaning. <br /> <br />* Tape the 'cleaning tool' to the pole so that it's nearby when needed. <br /> <br />* Haven't done so yet, but I hypothesize that spraying Static Guard on the brushes may be advantageous in keeping excess dust and 'knap' off the brushes. <br /> <br />Go ahead and buy it if your curiosity is getting the better of you. Follow the advice and expectations of this and other positive reviews and you'll be pleased.
0439813786|5.0|i heard about this on an NPR podcast, and was intrigued.  i bought it, and when i got it, i read it all in one setting.  the illustrations are excellent, and do more than just illustrate the story.  Unlike most illustrations, these actually serve to further the story, plot, and character development.  You have to pay attention to these intricate and careful black and white drawings. absolutely lovely!
B000OCXFCO|5.0|well what a great follow up from the system has failed, i wasn't expecting much from this album, i was a bit suprised when i heard it, for some reason this album puts rust in peace in head, not that it sounds like it but gives me the feel of rust in peace album. you will find that mustaines voice is more muture than some of his past albums thats a plus for me. so go ahead and give it a shot you'll either love it or hate it.
B000OMD4BG|5.0|Totally Elliot-totally unique. Other reviews say quite well what this album is and means. All I want to add is....sigh.... Elliot, I miss  you :(
B00079FUI6|5.0|Don't miss out on this superb show. \\"Desperate Housewives\\" is a fun, sassy, innovative TV phenomenon that mixtures drama, comedy and mystery to create what is perhaps the best TV show of the last decade. It is already regarded as pioneering a new genre and will probably go down in history as one of the most popular shows of our time. In case you've been living under a rock for the past 3 years: the show revolves around 5 seemingly normal housewives who one day learn that one of their friends took her own life following a mysterious secret that haunted her and that we would only learn of at the end of the season. Every housewife goes through her own turmoil (Hatcher falls for a sexy plumber; Cross struggles marital problems and the discovery that her son is gay; Huffman gives up her business career to be a full-time doting mommy to a bunch of hyperactive children; adulterous Longoria sleeps with her gardener and almost loses her home; and Sheridan as the supporting act is always there to make quip remarks). You'll find yourself laughing quite often, thanks to the witty script and the talent of these 4 veteran TV stars (excluding Longoria). Highly recommanded.

B000H5U832|5.0|My husband and i loved it! My 11 year old son as well as my 14 month old son loved it, they were so excited about the animated cars.  <br />The first DVD i got in the mail from Amazon kept freezing up and skipping a section, i contacted them and they sent a new one right to us.
B00005JPFF|2.0|I would give you a synopsis of what happens in SPIDER-MAN 3--but even that would be too long to sort out.<br /><br />To say that there's too much going on in this movie would be an understatement.  The experience might have been more comprehensible if they put three separate screens on a wall and ran the three different movies that are wrestling together in SPIDEY 3.<br /><br />SPIDER-MAN 2 hit the perfect balance of continuing Peter Parker's story with the emergence of (and connection with) Doctor Octopus.<br /><br />SPIDER-MAN 3 is pure chaos.  The Sandman is ripping off banks but we never find out what he's doing with the cash.  Somehow he was the one who killed Uncle Ben in convoluted flashbacks.  Gwen Stacy shows up a couple times--but for what?  Spider-man saves her but what about that crane going completely out of control?  Oh, yeah, Venom was in this movie, wasn't he?  Peter Parker goes Goth and acts like every immature worm in college these days.  Mary Jane sings TWICE--what's going on here!<br /><br />Since every male character gets their individual scene to shed some tears, I had wonder if there even was a script or just request cards from every actor as to what they'd like to do in this film.<br /><br />I'm assuming all the raving reviews here are coming from children and adults with Attention Deficit Disorder and without any awareness of things like plot and character.  Look, pretty colors and Playstation!<br /><br />I've loved the first two Spider-Man movies.  Hopefully number three will just be a bump in the road for the franchise.
B000MRAAJW|1.0|Real rating is a minus 30!  I was unable to access the DVD on ANY player!  I took it to Best Buy, and they said it will not work in any player they have in stock and are unable to program any player to play the DVD.  It was a total waste of money and a horrible experience with Amazon because they will not help in any way to correct the problem.
0316113077|4.0|i got this book as a gift. the pictures and recipes are presented cleanly and clearly. i have yet to try a recipe, but she really explains how to assemble the sculpted cakes. i would reccomend this book to any baker . its very pretty and Elisa is very talented.
B000A6CLL0|4.0|, besides the episode with the Vulcan Zombies, and the Forge on Vulcan, parts 1,2,and 3 from the final and 4th season, was \\"Similitude,\\" where Dr. Phlox has to clone Com. Charles Tucker Tripp, the chief engineer, to replace some brain tissue so he can be revived form a coma that resulted from an injury in time to save the ship stranded in a part of the expanse that is rapidly accumulating magnetic debris on it. Yes, I am a huge Tripp fan (I wish he would improve his website). I also love the episode where he and T'Pol have to strip down and rub antibacterial gel on themselves while in quarantine for most of a day, and the other episode where he accompanies her to Vulcan for a marriage. We can'y ever get enough Vulcan stuff. She is hot. I had to write this review after someone gave it a C-. No, sir, it is definitely an A, and one of the best ever, along with the 2 mirror universe episodes that were way too brief. I thought they had redesigned the show because of fan feedback, and I buckled my seatbelt for a ride-- man, was that exciting in season 4. I had missed these season 3  until after seeing  season 4, and was very impressed by the Vulcan Zombies. Ya, the Zindi stuff was a bit too drawn out, but I would say that Similitude was one of the top 10 of them , or even the top 5. We get to see Trip mature from an infant in a few days to an adault and fall in love with T'Pol. It was very endearing and emotionally touching. An excellent performance, almost as cool as ST III The Search For Spock movie, where  younger Spocks are seen maturing rapidly. Man, I can't believe the two of them did not show up for the Farewell Party. I was not too crazy about the   Eugenics episodes with Dr. Soong, but it was very cool seeing real Orion green slave women and Cold Station 12 was pretty good, with its biowarfare stuff. By the way, the episode about Dr. Phlox being kidnapped by the Klingons to cure their plague was very cool, explaining the enigma of the Klingons without ridges, ofwhich FAFSA corp alluded to in their now-defunct role-playing game. (Obviously, this relates to more than season 3, but I had to mention how good \\"Similitude\\" was, and squeeze in my whole review in 1 shabang). This would be a great opportuity for Atari, the exclusive ST game licenser for several years, to revive the unfinished original series game \\"Secret of Vulcan Fury,\\" from the now-defunct pc game company, Interplay, the intro for which can be viewed on either the CD-Rom set or the DVD version, or the Action-Pack edition with add-ons, of Star Trek Starfleet Academy-- 1 of the best 3 ST games ever (along with KA and EF). (I plan to go on a crusade for this when I get time- feel free to contact me, anyone, if interested in campaigning to see this game completed). But, back to Enterprise, it is one of the best shows ever (and thank goodness the shows only had on ferengi episode). And, yes, we needed more Tellarites (pig people), and they should have had Alpha Centarians-- but at least we got to see green orion slavewomen and blue Andorians (love the antennae) and their telepath subrace (man, was that ever cool). It is too bad they also had no 3-legges, 3-armed Edoans, with their orange skin and concave heads and yellow eyes , or any Catians (cat people-- these can be seen, among other places, in the animated series). P.S.: Koodos to Sulu for coming out-- that took guts. Paramount: we need more green-blooded Vulcan artwork for sale!
0425188809|5.0|Watchers is, I'd say, the perfect example of the sort of novels Dean Koontz used to write, back in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It has excitement, danger, monsters, shadowy government forces, recombinant DNA, a man, a woman and a super-intelligent dog. What more could one ever want in a thriller?  There is a refreshing lack of quirky humour, and an absence of eccentric names, just thrills, suspense, action. For those who are only familiar with Koontz's most recent output, I recommend Watchers. It will show you what the rest of us have been missing for the last decade.
0517543052|4.0|being it was a new book i only expected a few things. one that it was in good shape, and it was, and two, that it arrived on time, witch it did. so i can honestly say that i am pleased with my purchase from amazon.
B000EGF0B4|1.0|The only redeeming thing about this movie is the scenery.  I am not giving this movie one star because of the sexual content.  I am giving this movie one star because of the acting.  Heath Ledger mumbled his lines do badly I could not understand a word he was saying, and I watched this move twice.  A cardboard standup would have displayed more acting ability than Jake Gyllenhaal.  My advice, don't bother.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I have been wanting this album to come out now forever, but when it did come I was truly surprised. Linkin Park did something different, which was expected. Nobody thought that they would keep doing things the same way, but this change came as unnexpected. I personally listen to just about every type of music from under the sun, so it didn't really phase me when Minutes to Midnight wasn't chalk full of rap-metal. What we get is a sort of pop rock album with ballads and minimal hip hop beat intros but also some interesting deviations with metal, rap, and pop. I was surprised though, to find tracks that were not fully rock or metal or anything like that. Especially In Between brings back the electronic feeling of Hybrid Theory, but extremely minimal. After listening several times to the whole album, in found there is a very prominent political message about an irresponsible government and environmental awareness. This abrupt change in topic was very welcome to me. I'd definitely like to think that Linkin Park is growing up. I'd have to say my favorite track is the last on the album, The Little Things Give You Away. The melodies and lyrics are very touching and appreciated. Overall, Minutes to Midnight gets five stars for an impressive step in a new direction.
B000EGCITG|5.0|Never bought any of Pink CD before until seeing her performance of \\"Dear Mr President\\" on Jimmy Kimmel..  This young lady can really sing, most of the tracks are really great.. Not afraid to voice her point of view about anything.. Definitely a winner from an talented young lady.
B000O178BY|5.0|A masterpiece in the making....a revolution in music.  Its simple beats contast with some complex guitar movements, brings back old school into 21st century music.  With some music nowadays, sounding repeative and boring.  Here comes a new sound from Trent Renzor!   <br />The first song \\"Hyperpower!\\" just brings you into his visionary world of 2022, emotions high, marching of troops, the world now in complete control of the goverment.  Freedoms lost and now hope gone.   <br />\\"God Given\\" a favorite of mine, because of its funky beats, then retro turns your attention to religion.  <br /> <br />\\"I would never tell you anything that wasn't absolutely true that hadn't come right from his mouth and he wants me to tell you.\\" <br /> <br />This record has to be Trent Renzors best by far!
B000MRAAJW|4.0|Don't get me wrong. This is a wonderfully shot series. However, as with any documentary, you need more than just shots. The narration is good, but the story jumps all over the place. The same material is often recycled in other segments in the DVD series.     In addition, based on the hype, I thought that unlike any previous national geographic special, this documentary would have had significantly more original material than it actually did.     Overall, loses 1 star for repetition and lack of a cohesive story/special features.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Out of all their CDs that they currently have out I think this one is the winner. Their I stand alone song, Changes and Straight Out of Line all rock.
B000002B1M|4.0|Nas's \\" it was written\\" is it a classic ?Basically. Beats wise, lircally wise, and Nas was killing with his words back then. Strictly for fans of true hip hop. Few tracks such as streamdreams, blackgirllost and uhm if i rule the world were a bit commercial but thats about it. Its sick!
B000K7UBTI|3.0|I was disappointed by this film. It starts out great but devolves into a robot bash rock-em/sock-em. The story line is both confusing and not memorable. I watched the movie and cannot remember nothing about it at all. It's really not that good of a film. It could've been much better.  <br /> <br />I would not recommend it to anyone but hardcore Ironman fans
B000NQR7NO|4.0|(by Phil Posen):<br /><br />Straight outta Sheffield, the Arctic Monkeys return with their highly anticipated follow up to their debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, Thats What I'm Not.  They deliver the goods with a darker and much more polished Favourite Worst Nightmare.<br /><br />Being hailed as the saviors of music in their home of England puts a bit of pressure on the only 20-year-old boys who still live with the parental units (not to be confused with any sort of cheap rental space).<br /><br />On this album they definitely try harder to impress by producing more polished sounds and experimenting with new song ideas. The undeniably catchy radio single, \\"Brainstorm\\" that came out only a week or so before the album was a good preview of Favourite....

B000000W6R|5.0|I first heard the Smashing Pumpkins on the Singles Soundtrack, the song was called Drown and, even thought it didn't make it to a SP album, it is as good as the best the band has produced. <br />A collection of b-sides which are, mostly, the leftovers from the astounding Siamese Dream (which may be my favourite cd of all time), Pisces Iscariot shows the great moment billy was having as a songwriter (though he certainly didn't feel so). It opens, quietly, with the incredibly beautiful soothe (recorded in billy's apartment, or in a hotel room, i don't quite remember), and follows with the energetic Frail and Bedazzled. There, you get the impression that these songs didn't quite fit Siamese Dream (which is a very tight album). They are great, but not in the same mood, or maybe there were songs on SD that already fulfilled the purpose of these material. <br />Anyway, the rest of the cd is just first class material, I particularly love the nice guitar work of Whir, the tender and surprisingly enchanting interpretation of Landslide, the sonic bliss of Starla, and the slow builder, La Dolly Vita. This cd is one of the best samples of alternative rock, if such a thing ever existed. oh, don't forget to check out Siamese Dream, Mellon Collie and Adore, which are also great pumpkins cds (even better than this one)

B00012FXB8|2.0|Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986) are among the best action/horror/sci-fi films ever made, the first being a claustrophobic nightmare of a movie and the second being a thrilling, action-packed sequel that continued and built upon the themes introduced in the first. And then, David Fincher ruined the whole series within the first fifteen minutes of Alien 3. <br /> <br />Actually, I like quite a bit of Fincher's work, especially Seven and Fight Club, but Alien 3 might be the most disappointing sequel of all time, systematically destroying every element that made Aliens one of the best. First, he kills off Hicks, Newt, and Bishop, wasting the talents of the three actors as well as obliterating the surrogate mother and man vs. machine themes of Aliens. Those characters were half the reason that Aliens was so great. Then, he compounds the issue by having Ripley attend Newt's autopsy without shedding so much as a single tear. The rest of the film plays out with Ripley and the prisoners fighting against a quadruped alien, without the aid of any weapons. The idea of Ripley carrying a queen alien and throwing herself to her death to keep the queen out of the hands of the Company was a fine, powerful ending to the series, but Fincher destroyed the possibility of any human drama about her demise; all the characters that she cared about have already gone before her.  <br /> <br />Yes, I've heard that Fincher does not deserve all the blame, and yes, I know that Fox ruthlessly shredded his ideas and stole the film from right under his nose, but honestly, nothing in Alien 3 could redeem the first fifteen minutes of the film. It's like a slap in the face; everything that happened in Aliens didn't matter in the slightest, and it does not improve on the ideas of the first two, not once, throughout the whole film, right up until the poetic finale. And that isn't nearly enough to make Alien 3 a good, or even worthwhile film. Rewatching it recently has only confirmed that in my mind.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|Rush has been one of my favorite bans for years. In fact, I'll be seeing them for my fifth time in concert next month for their tour supporting Snakes and Arrows. All I can say is I hope they don't play too mmuch of this \\"new\\" material. <br /> <br />Rush is still one of the best bands out there, but their music is getting less and less inspiring with each new release. This album just feels that is was released for monetary gain. <br /> <br />If you're new to Rush, start with some of the older, more inspiired material.
0307263118|4.0|The temporal layers of the story make it a little bit confusing in the beginning, but by the end you understand this man's grief and search to find himself by going back to the town where he lived as a child, trying to make sense out of his life and who he has become.  My book club read this and we all enjoyed the writing and story. Some people will not like this book.  It is not a fast paced story, but it is a story full of emotion.  Soo.... go read it.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|I got this dvd in the super ultimate collectors edition set that also included Superman I , II , III and IV. I watched Superman I- beautifully restored and reprinted in vibrant color with outstanding sound. The next night I watched the special info that comes with this disk regarding the restoration of the Donner cut and then watched the film.  <br />WOW! I know that having 2 films where Superman resets time is a cop out- but to be fair that was not supposed to happen in the first film...this aside. If I had seen Donner's cut of Superman II back in the 1980s I would have paid to see more Superman movies. As it was I always hated the Lester film's cop out ending with the memory erasing kiss.  <br />I loved the scenes that were restored to Donners vision and the fight scenes were amazing. Use of Marlon Brando was very effective in the fortress- his work was missed in the Lester edition. <br />Overall- well worth viewing- a must for any true Superman fan!

0316018953|3.0|Read the original serial and it was a fairly decent read.  But I'm reading the book version of it now and am surprised at how shallow and elementary it seems.  The writing at times virges on \\"See Spot.  See Spot run.\\"  Harry seems wooden and bland when compared to even the more recent books.<br /><br />This probably should have been kept as an exclusive to the NYT.  It just doesn't seem to be up to par when compared to the other Bosch books/stories.  The only thing that it will probably accomplish is to set up the next Bosch book and Connelly won't have to explain how and why Harry changed jobs again.
B00064X3FO|5.0|This being Elton John's second album after \\"Empty Sky\\", it truly embarked Elton on his remarkable career.  It was the first of many productions by Gus Dudgeon and contained Elton's first group of band members that would last throughout the seventies.  \\"Your Song\\" was the big hit here, but songs like, \\"Take Me To The Pilot\\" and \\"Border Song\\" became FM radio station staples.  Elton also recorded live with an orchestra here and it marks the first time that he really took advantage of the setup.  Stand-out cuts are \\"Sixty Years On\\" and \\"The King Must Die\\"; songs he later recreated in concert.  Bonus tracks, \\"Bad Side Of The Moon\\", \\"Rock `n Roll Madonna\\" and \\"Grey Seal\\" were fantastic single B-Side cuts that should have been on the original album.  In fact, \\"Grey Seal\\" was later rerecorded for \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\".  In SACD Surround Sound, this album is like being in the studio with Elton John the first time he had a huge success.  This is a landmark album.
0670034711|3.0|I bought this book because I needed a vicarious trip around the world. (Not really going anywhere this summer.) It was entertaining, especially since my past travels have taken me to Italy and Bali - I enjoyed going back via this read. For the most part, I think the reviewers here are being either too harsh (take it for what it is, people - Gilbert isn't claiming to be a grand literary talent - she's not) or too glowing. I suppose if you had a five-star reading experience, fine - it's your experience - rate it as you like! Obviously, this book spoke to a lot of people in a more intense way than it spoke to me. As for the 1-stars:  Sure, Gilbert comes off as narcissitic, but she never claims not to be. She's a privileged white woman with money to spare - if you can't accept that, don't read the book. Honestly, it was interesting \\"meeting\\" her, but I wouldn't necessarily want to hang out with her. I'm not crazy about her style - her metaphors are ....hmmm overly contrived and many are extended beyond what I thought could be possible. I do agree with those reviewers who liken the book to a long magazine article. But isn't that what you want sometimes? No, it's not high-brow lit, but in my opinion, an amusing beach/back porch read.
B00000AFWZ|4.0|Le titre peut être trompeur car ce coffret ne renferme pas uniquement du psych&eacute;d&eacute;lique, il est important de tenir compte du \\"era\\" dans le titre. En effet, ce coffret pr&eacute;sente la musique d'une &eacute;poque 1965-68 mais ne se limite pas qu'au psych&eacute;d&eacute;lique. On y puise dans le rock de garage, le frat-rock et le psych&eacute;d&eacute;lique confondus. C'est &agrave; la fois la force et la faiblesse de ce coffret qui devient par le fait même un excellent survol de bijoux issus de cette &eacute;poque mais ce n'est pas le coffret &agrave; faire jouer pour un bon buzz lysergique ou psylocibien (d'o&ugrave; le 4 &eacute;toiles)... C'est plutôt un gros \\"teaser\\". J'ai de la difficult&eacute; aussi avec le \\"first\\" parce qu'il est clair que le psych&eacute;d&eacute;lisme existe depuis des milliers d'ann&eacute;es bien que l'appellation n'existait pas encore... Bref, un peu pr&eacute;tentieux mais excellent, et un moyen d'obtenir des titres  de vieux psych&eacute;d&eacute;lique autrement difficiles &agrave; d&eacute;nicher... La pr&eacute;sentation du coffret est aussi magnifique, avec des pochettes aux couleurs flamboyantes et un livret d'infos complet et bien fait. Pour du vrai psych&eacute;d&eacute;lique, se tourner vers le coffret Acid drops, Spacedust and Flying Saucers, les compilations Beyond the calico wall, Psychedelic Experience volume 1&2, Pebbles vol.3, Electric Sugarcube Flasbacks, Rubbles (toutes) et Chocolate soup for diabetics (toutes). Il y en a d'autres excellentes mais celles-ci sont relativement faciles &agrave; trouver et vous injecterons plein de couleurs (des plus obscures et ind&eacute;finissables aux plus fluorescentes) dans les oreilles!
B0000793ZA|5.0|Often records I one loved 20 years ago don't hold up well to the test of time.  Book of Love's records, Killing Joke's \\"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns\\" and several others fall into this category.  That said, I bought \\"Sparkle in the Rain\\" on vinyl when it first came out way back in the mid-1980s.  After being introduced to Simple Minds via \\"New Gold Dream\\" (on limited edition gold vinyl even...) this was a welcome addition to my record collection.  I remember being amazed at the driving rhythms and the powerful vocals.  I hadn't listened to or even thought of the record until a few weeks ago when someone off-handedly mentioned Simple Minds telling me \\"I'm alive and kicking.\\"  That made me seek out and replace my long-missing LP with this CD.  I'm glad I did and am enjoying it right now as I take a break from writing a thesis.
1933784032|5.0|Lorne Peterson's book is another great Star Wars book being released to coincide with the movie's 30th anniversary.  I've always been interested in the making of all six movies, and this book doesn't disappoint in letting us know how the model shop he headed at ILM accomplished the movie magic they have been doing for three decades.  My only critique is that there could have been more photographs and the binding leaves something to be desired with some photos being severely \\"split\\".  I was wondering if the book would start falling apart after a while...  But overall, a book any Star Wars fan should have.  I'm looking to forward to Steve Sansweet's new book due out in October.

1594489505|5.0|I have just finished Khaled's Hosseini's lastest book. I GREATLY enjoyed this book! It is similar to the Kite runner in that the story quickly brings the reader into the story. This book is much darker than Kite Runner. Though much of the story the women are repressed and abused by the male dominated society. It is a tale of adversity and hardship which the female characters persevere and overcome. I reminds me somewhat of the Good Earth by Pearl Buck in that the main characters face obstacles and overcome them.
0345494768|5.0|What an amazing book!  I was fourteen when Star Wars was released, and I used to have \\"The Art of Star Wars\\" back then.  This book, however, is a wonderful treat for us fans, especially now that the movie is thirty years old.  It's amazing what the artists, designers and movie crew could do back then, especially if you consider how inexpensive the movie turned out to be (by today's standards, that is).  Thanks to J.W. Rinzler for writing this.  The one thing that surprised me: it's a big and very heavy book, and it's not a coffee table picture book at all, but a well-documented history of the making of a movie that changed the lives of many.
B00005J6T0|4.0|After having ruled the chart with preceding Like A Virgin, Madonna seemingly tries to reflect and express herself genuinely in her third album True Blue. Working with her old friend (Stephen Bray) and an unknown producer (Patrick Leonard), the sound production, prevalent light funk in the 80s, is ordinary but straightforward and intimate. Broadened song themes include an uplifting message to a woman on the edge (\\"Papa Don't Preach\\"), a love-and-peace anthem (\\"Love Makes the World Go Round\\"), nostalgia for a memorable foreign place (\\"La Isla Bonita\\"), and many love songs from assertive \\"Open Your Heart\\" and \\"White Heat\\" to introspective \\"Live To Tell\\" to happy \\"True Blue\\" to silly \\"Jimmy Jimmy.\\" Combined together, they all serve portraying multidimensional Madonna. The album is full of positive energy, most likely thanks to her own true love to \\"the coolest guy in the universe\\" back in the time.
B000MTFDCO|5.0|David Fincher's follow up to his out of nowhere masterpiece \\"Seven\\" is another example of his true genius.  The Game is a film that grabs on to you and doesn't let up until the end.  Even after it's over you still question everything you've seen and go over the film in your head.  This is a film deserving of repeat viewing.  The HDDVD quality is superior to any other version of this film available;although it would have been nice to have some extras on it.  Who knows maybe a special edition is on the horizon.
0676978819|3.0|Like many of McEwan's books, this one was difficult to hate/difficult to love.  Difficult to hate as McEwan is one of the most skillful writers in English right now--he writes sentences that are among the most elegant going.  At the same time, it was difficult for me to get the sense of this book as a fully realized work, as On Chesil Beach is indeed a sketch, rather than a novel.  The story concerns a pair of newlyweds preparing for their first night as man and wife.  Like many of McEwan's early works, On Chesil Beach deals very intimately with the vagaries and raw emotions that are at the center of any sexual relationship.  In this particular case, you are presented with a couple who are deeply in love with one another, but whose respective attitudes to their imminent conjugal congress could not be further removed from each other.  The eventual confrontation is told with startling detail and finely observed nuance.  Yet the book is repeatedly interjected with exhaustive exposition that feels largely superfluous.  Ultimately, I must say that On Chesil Beach irritated me far less than the equally well written Saturday.  At the same time, this work can only be considered a minor accomplishment.    While I am at it, I wanted to make anyone interested in this book aware of Jonathan Lethem's EXCELLENT review in the New York Times Book Review. Lethem has summed up just what makes McEwan McEwan in an incredibly succinct and accurate fashion. Like much of Lethem's criticism, it is spot on.

0380789035|5.0|To be honest I wasn't what you would call an addicted reader of late. I started trying to read Dracula and I guess it's alright, but it just didn't hook me. So my director and friend told me I had to read this book. In fact he basically demanded that I stop reading that \\"boring\\" vampire book and pick this up IMMEDIATELY. We share many of the same taste in music, movies, and art in general so I picked up American Gods by Neil Gaiman and I never put it down.<br /><br />I got so entrapped in this story I HAD to know what was going to happen to Shadow next I had to know where Wednesday was leading him and why he kept having all the amazingly odd dreams he was having. It started off well and caught my attention fast when the first curve ball was thrown just before Shadow was released from prison. Then a strange journey began and I felt like I was riding shotgun the whole time. Sitting in the white nova between Shadow and his passengers listening and experiencing all the excitement with him. The imagination of Gaiman is just amazing simply put he's got one of the most creative minds I've ever seen for an author. He researched what he couldn't think up and put a sense of familiarity with the places and attractions he used to show the \\"true\\" America as it's seen by the Gods. I was just enjoying the ride as I read then twist after twist started to hit me over and over and by the end of the novel my heart was pumping and I read the last 200 pages in one night just to know what happened in Rock City!!! But I don't want to give anything away because the sheer unknown is what makes this an epic story and a real page turner. You'll sympathize with Shadow and wonder what you would do if you were to be in the same situation.<br /><br />I highly recommend you pick this up and read it. I did and now I'm about to start my 4th book in less than 3 months (I hadn't read a full book in over a year and that was for English in college :P). It sparked something and really turned me on to stories and characters. It's the best book I've read thus far in my life, period.stories and characters. It's the best book I've read thus far in my life, period.
0385340559|5.0|When conceiving the Jack Reacher series, bestselling author Lee Child wanted the protagonist to be consistent from book to book. At the same time, however, he was determined to make each installment stand on its own. This way, one can pick up any Reacher novel (regardless of order) without the need for a general back story. Such an arrangement is considerate to the reader yet also gutsy --- one does not feel compelled to purchase previous volumes, so the author is betting that the reader will like the series well enough after one taste to pick up on the rest.<br /><br />Keeping the Jack Reacher series accessible to new readers at any point has not prevented Child from making each of the books better than the last --- and BAD LUCK AND TROUBLE is no exception.<br /><br />The story begins in Portland, Oregon, where Reacher receives a cryptic message from a member of the special investigations unit he had been asked to form while in the U.S. military police. Longtime readers of the series will immediately wonder how one leaves a message for a man with no apparent ties or contacts. The answer is worth the price of admission to BAD LUCK AND TROUBLE all by itself --- and gives the first of many hints of the wonders to come.<br /><br />It seems that someone has murdered a member of the team, and that several others are missing and possibly dead as well. The group's motto, \\"You do not mess with the special investigators,\\" gives Reacher and his former teammate only one course of action to pursue. Their painstaking investigation leads them slowly but inexorably not only to the \\"who\\" of the hostile actions but also to the \\"why,\\" even as the answers demonstrate that if Reacher is to exact revenge for the wrong done to his colleagues, then he must do so quickly or sacrifice his desire for the greater good.<br /><br />Lee Child, who always seems to be at the top of his game, finds new summits to climb in BAD LUCK AND TROUBLE and --- no surprise here --- conquers them quite handily.

B000NVIXFK|3.0|These guys are relying too much on just being good on the guitar and not creative or as fun as other bands.  There are just other, better CD's out there more worth the time and money.  Far Cry is by far the best song on the Cd and is worth listening.
1400034779|4.0|I'm a High school student in California. The No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency was my book club book, so I read it. First time, it was not that fun or interesting to me. Because, I expected serious cases such as murder. However, chapter by chapter, I realized that the author wants to show something to us such as the women independence or the common but important struggles between person and person. And he shows to us the processes of solve the cases which we should know. Also the book shows that many weakness environments in Africa but also it tells us that they do their best to live and be happy. The background of this story is Botswana which is located in Southern Africa. It is not that much developed however, that country, is really peaceful and clam. Even that makes me want to live there. Mma Ramotswe is really powerful and independent women in the story who is the main character. She lost her mom when she was very young and unfortunately, she also lost her baby when her baby was got born. But he emphasizes that even Mma Ramotswe who has the sad backgrounds she can be the No.1 in the Botswana by her own business. I really recommend this book to you. It can make you happy and warm.
1594489505|5.0|Hosseini has proven that his first novel isn't a fluke.  While his first novel (\\"Kite Runner\\") is a coming of age story of a young man, his second (\\"A Thousand Splendid Suns) is a tale of two women.  The books are so different that I would be unable to pick one over the other.  While part of  his first novel was painful to read,  part of his second novel triggered silent tears.  Hosseini's first two novels are effortless reads.  The characters are vivid and evoke empathy; consequently, these two books are genuinely \\"up-put-down-able\\".  They are contemporary yet are classics.  I have recommended both books to family and friends.  <br />
B000OONTFU|4.0|The reviews listed here so far are fairly confusing.  A lot of people like it, but there are a handful of 1 star reviews, which, in my opinion, are wrong. <br /> <br />First of all, I can't see how ANYONE could compare the video quality of the first movie in HD to the original DVD release, no matter what resolution it's up-converted to.  NO COMPARISON whatsoever.  The original looks awful up-converted, the new HD version looks amazing.  I've seen the movie a bunch of times, and I noticed a lot of things in the HD version I've never seen before. <br /> <br />As to the reviews where people are knocking it for being sold as a one-piece collection.  You don't like it, don't buy it.  The single release HD versions will be out later.  I am giving it a 4 star instead of 5 star rating for pretty much the same reasons, but I can only see taking off 1 star because of the price/pack issue.  The extras disk is well done, and of course the Animatrix wasn't re-released in HD.  I doubt that half the original content was made in Hi-Def quality. <br /> <br />If you're a big, big fan of the original movie, and have a good HD setup, do yourself a favor and spend the money.  They did a great job.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Those four guys from SoCal who used to where socks on there jocks have given us the Rock Record of the year.  There is no filler, every song is great and every song is different.  The lyrics, the funky bass, and the shredding guitar all come to paint a beautiful picture.  This album is a must hear for all.
0312954468|5.0|Right up there with The First Man In Rome: fantastic story, characters you love to hate, hate to love, I couldn't put it down, and and was exited to read the next book (which you should skip btw).  Just plain fun! <br /> <br />Really fun read and some of the battle/gore was so well written I was a little queasy sometimes...but never could put it down.   <br /> <br />Skip book two (painful painful painful) and go on to book three.  Book three doesn't require knowledge of book 2 in any way (just book)
B00012QM8G|2.0|I ordered this movie without having ever seen it before. I got it, watched it, and was pretty disappointed. It was so boring I coulden't get through the whole movie.
B000MGBSI0|5.0|The DVD set was delivered very promptly as promised and the quality was excellent.   <br /> <br />The content of the show is great...(that goes without saying to any Melrose Place fan!!!!).
B000MCH5P4|5.0|Wow, that's all I can say.  This film was great.  Despite it's mixed bag of reviews, I can honestly say this is a film that I could not turn away from.  The actors/actresses felt as if they were next door neighbors, or people that you had known for some time.  The first time I watched a film like this (where the storyline seems to bounce all over from start to finish) I'll admit, I wasn't a fan.  The more it is used (which seems to be quite a bit more now) the more it grows on me.  You just have to watch this film.  So many emotional performances.  Give it a shot.  You won't be disappointed.
B000NQR7NO|5.0|I have yet to find such an enjoyable CD! This is packed with high-energy danceable tunes from start to finish (excluding Only Ones Who Know). Maybe not quite the same Arctic Monkeys you knew from Whatever People Say, but this change of pace is very much welcomed. Every track is catchy, in some respect, whether it be the vocals or the guitar riffs. There isn't a single track I don't like on here.
055358202X|5.0|The reason this book only focuses on the more \\"minor characters\\" is because GRRM ended up with too large a book. It has been stated that he had to do this in order to accomplish two tasks. The first being that had book 4 contained everything it would be thousands of pages long. The second reason is because it does take a long time to get these books out so had he continued with what was proving to be a very long installment it would have delayed the release for book 4 even more. I also feel that there really are no minor characters as every person reacts and changes due to interactions with other characters. Some of these have been proven already as others may be yet to come. As the series is not completed one can not truly have an understanding of where each characters placement is in the story or what that person may accomplish.     The entire series is beautifully done and incomparable to any other fantasy story I have read.  This book as well as the three prior are truly works of art. If you enjoyed the first 3 you will love this as much, especially knowing that GRRM has not forgotten our favorite characters. There stories have just been postponed to the next installment so that he can devote as much time as is necessary to each individual.    One must understand that it takes a lot to get a book published along with all the other things that GRRM is doing. Such as other projects, the HBO series, as well as life! Unless one is an author it is difficult to understand all the demands made on one. For just a glimpse you should check out his website. Just google his name and maybe then you will understand a tad of what the author is thinking.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|I do not own this as of yet (I don't know why), its a fantastic movie.  The first time I saw a trailer for this movie I was hooked.  I waited patiently for this movie to make it to the theaters so I could go and see it in \\"big screen glory.\\"  It was great.  We talked about it for quite a while after we left the theater.  Now that I think of it, I need to go and get this on DVD.  Clive Owen is spot on as usual, and Michael Caine did quite a good job as well.  The story will keep you wanting more.  A keeper for years to come.
1596912855|4.0|Shannon Hale has found success with her novels for teens, which often retell folktales and fairy tales. She has a talent for giving would-be princesses interesting backstories and well-earned triumphs.<br /><br />Her first novel for adults which is quite unlike her previous works - and every bit as enjoyable. Austenland is the story of Jane, a twenty-nine-year-old New Yorker whose day job is successful but rather unsatisfying. Jane is secretly obsessed with Mr. Darcy from Pride & Prejudice and has watched the BBC miniseries countless times.<br /><br />Jane is snatched out of her humdrum life when a family tragedy leads her to visit a very special resort in England. There, everyone and everything is straight out of the Regency period. She must dress, speak, and act accordingly. The three-week trip could be the time of her life -- or her wake-up call to actually get a life.<br /><br />Jane Austen fans will lap up Austenland like a happy kitten with a saucer of cream. Both the wit and pacing are quick, with no words or time wasted. This romantic comedy is sure to make readers laugh one page and smirk the next. Not only is it a fast read, but it's also a fairly clean read, allowing her teen fans to share that saucer and enjoy Jane's sauciness.<br /><br />The audio edition is literally suits the story's tone. The characters sound as they should, with Jane's words and the narration delivered in an American accent while the English characters have their lovely lilts.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|Stars Phoenix and Witherspoon are the movie. Their performances are top-drawer as, surprisingly, is their singing. Phoenix worked hard to master the tics and idiosyncracies of Johnny Cash. In fact, having seen Cash in concert on several occasions, I occasionally felt that some of the signature gestures, such as the pout and guitar slinging were a bit overdone.<br /><br />  The storyline wasn't all that engrossing. Too much emphasis for me on a few selected episodes from Cash's life and nothing at all mentioned about many of Cash's excesses.<br /><br />  Johnny Cash was a solid performer and also a man who made many poor choices in his life and lived with them. I don't think he would have been offended to see incidents like his firing by Grand Ole Opry included in the film, considering that he more than made up for that behavior in later years.<br /><br />  Overall though, it's a pretty good film.<br /><br />Jerry
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Planet Earth in High Definition you've heard people raving about it for good reason, it is an awesome presentation of awe-inspiring spectacles you will never see, unless you happen to have a bank account to rival Trump.  <br /> <br />WOW! The HD DVD looks even better than Discover Channel HD's presentation! <br />The sound is wonderful. Dolby Digital Surround. <br />How that works out I don't know, I was under the impression that it would be Dolby 2.0.  But it's not.  <br /> <br />I do wonder why the none of the high def editions of Planet Earth got the same special features the regular DVD set got? <br />David Attenborough, nothing against you but where did Sigourney Weaver's charming voice over from the Discovery Channel go? <br /> <br />Bottom line: This is why we have a HD TVs and if you have a HD DVD player this show will amaze you. Wonderful product! Can't say enough about it. <br />
0316018953|5.0|Harry Bosch fans have yet another delight awaiting them in \\"The Outlook\\". Originally serialized in The New York Times magazine, the series, according to Connelly, has been expanded with additional characters and storylines for the novel. Whatever he did, the novel works well and reads fast --- I consumed it in a day of on-and-off reading.<br /><br />  Bosch has a new partner, Ignacio Ferras. Ferras's relative youth and inexperience becomes a component part of the storyline as Harry \\"Bull In  A China Shop\\" Bosch gets into gear.<br /><br />  Bosch has been assigned from cold cases to Robbery Homicide Division and he is up late at night literally waiting for the phone to ring. It does: a body with two bullets to the head has been found on the Mulholland Overlook. The deceased was a physicist with access to radioactive materials in many Los Angeles hospitals, materials that could be used to make dirty bombs and other terrorist weapons.<br /><br />  Needless to say, all the usual antagonists want a piece of the investigation and maybe a piece of Harry as well. There's the FBI and a bunch of other federal alphabet soup agencies. There's LA's own \\"homeland security unit\\", led by the inept Captain \\"Does Badly\\".  And, of course, there's the requisite invocation of Irving Irving, Bosch's enemy in so many books.<br /><br />  The hunt is on for the terrorists suspected of enginering the complex plot to gain possession of the radioactive cesium.<br /><br />  But there are surprises in store for Bosch and the reader. Personally I think Connelly takes the surprises a step too far into Perry Mason-land. But that's simply my opinion. The surprises, whether plausible or not, don't derail the book: Connelly's writing is too strong to permit that.<br /><br />  Overall, it's another great installment in the Harry Bosch lifeline. Bosch is one of the great characters of modern poular fiction and Connelly serves both Bosch and the reader well.<br /><br />Jerry
0307275639|1.0|This book is poorly written, poorly developed, pretentious and above all sanctimonious to it's very core.  It will indeed change your life though, it will make you realize that popular contemporary books are complete wastes of time and natural resources that could have been put to better use making toilet paper.  I highly recommend burning this book-it deserves nothing else. If you disagree with this posting and feel that \\"Tuesday's with Morrie\\" is the greatest thing since sliced bread, well...I feel sorry for you.  Terrible. Trash.  Could have been written by any bum off the street.
1400063515|5.0|I found \\"The Black Swan\\" by Nassim Taleb to be fascinating.  One reason I was interested in reading the book is that something appearing to be analogous to \\"Black Swans\\" (i.e., rare and important events) may be found in turbulent flows and in the heterogeneity (extreme variability of certain physical properties) in natural sediments.  Just as with Taleb's applications to economics and politics, scientists are attempting do describe the statistics of the variability using non-Gaussian, stochastic fractal, concepts.  Some type of mathematical/physical chaos seems to underlie all these phenomena, which results in unpredictable behavior with a deterministic component.  Taleb's book \\"The Black Swan\\" does a superior job of explaining and illustrating the basic ideas using economics and politics, topics with which many people are familiar.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Of all the people presenting themselves as potential candidates for the Democratic nomination, one who is not should be.  And as proof, examine his well reasoned and award winning \\"Inconvenient Truth.\\"  It's dissemination should be widespread.  After viewing it, you too will shout, \\"Al Gore for President!\\"  This gentle, intelligent, soft-spoken, personable man is head and shoulders above the announced candidates, and I hope and pray he will opt to run.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|One of the only movies i have watched 3 times in a row after getting it. When i look for good movies i look for the little things you don't notice at first, AC is full of this and a worthy addition to anybody's collection.
1582701709|4.0|It's a shame that the power of positive thinking, feeling, and living has resorted to envisioning oneself behind the wheel of your brand new BMW. For those of you that are using the secret for material things, it won't work. If you use this power for material things, you'll end up eventually feeling guilty, which in turn will put the negative feelings back in you. The authors are obviously using these tactics to sell more product, but many of us can see deeper into this, and realize that the secret should be used primarily for health, love, respect, and the little things that make our daily lives so wonderful. If you use the secret for that brand new BMW you'll end up with nothing but a KIA. - Joey Rahimi
B000MR9D5E|5.0|My family LOVES nature documentaries and this is one of the best!  We make popcorn and watch a couple segments for Family Movie Night.  I also kind of like the extra DVD that shows how the camera crews got some of these shots--amazing!  Very educational, too, as my young children remember lots of what they see and then compare it to things they observe on hikes, in stories, and other fictional movies.  Only drawback to DVD is that sometimes I wish it went into more detail about a certain animal, but that's what libraries are for, I guess.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series, as seen on Discovery Channel, was so fascinating I had to have the entire series.  My whole family enjoys the series.  <br />
B00004WF68|5.0|Many mid-60's artists, names too countless to mention here, failed to bridge the gap from the R&R/soul based music of that day to the more experimental stylings which followed.  Not so with Mr. Winwood, who jumped from Spencer Davis Group to form Traffic with fellow headliner Dave Mason and relative unknowns Jim Capaldi (dr) and Chris Wood (woodwinds).  Actually, Dave Mason often slid by the wayside allowing Winwood's influence to prevail.  The US cover of this LP was a rather unimaginative photo of the group members, whereas the UK version (used here) gave us more insight as to what the music inside \\"looked like.\\"  This was, perhaps, evidence of the UK's head start on the dreamier elements of psychedelia.  Songs like \\"Hole in My Shoe\\" and \\"Berskhire Poppies\\" utilized heavy phasing and made us hang on white-knuckled for awhile til we got the idea.  Yet we also got the beautiful ballad \\"No Face No Name No Number\\" which became an oft-covered standard.  A cornucopia of styles at work here, and more songs than appeared on the original releases of this LP. For example, the title tune from \\"Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush\\" which fits here quite well.  If you are expecting the long jams of latter era Traffic, think again. A seminal work from a transitional age.
B00000F169|5.0|This film answers the question what do you do when your crew was scraped up from the people rejected for spaceflight, you are light years from home, your smart bombs are smarting off, a captured alien gets out of his pen, and your ship is falling apart.  <br /> <br />It is a important film to see, not for the flashy special effects, there aren't any, but for the characterizations and plot lines. It is the obverse of the spit and polish of many SF films.  <br /> <br />This does not portray the best and brightest in space, its more like putting fruits and nuts in a can and sending it into deep space for a mission nobody really cares about anymore.
B00013M6NK|4.0|Battery is good. The charge life is shorter than I would expect.
B000OMD4BG|3.0|Elliott Smith has the kind of voice, and sound that I love, love. It's the soft, simplistic, soul music ( think Cary Brothers, James Blunt, Mat Kearney) that I just love. I could listen to four hours.  <br />His music while nice, is so similiar to a million other songs like this, is nothing new. Unfortunately, this has been done, too many times. I wish he had a little more original take on his bluesy, melancholy sound.  <br />His Miss Mistery reminds me so much of the Cary Brother's blue eyes that it's hard to listen too. I like the Cary Brothers better than this guy. But, if you're like me and you just can't get enough of this bar blues, depressing music ( and i mean that as complimentary) than this album will do.
0800141660|5.0|A \\"MUST HAVE\\" for the J. Austen fans and the DVD collection! The sisters (Elinor and Marianne) were well-portrayed by Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet. I especially liked the actress who portrayed Ms Lucy Steele-- the body language, the facial expressions, etc. were so effective in portending the true nature of this character (who was found to be quite conniving and insidious in her engagement with Edward and later his brother Robert). With the exception of the male actor who played the Colonel, I found the female actresses to be more convincing in their portrayal of the female characters in Sense and Sensibility. Overall, this film adaptation remains quite true to the book story line. One would not have to read the book in order to understand the film story line. I enjoyed watching it and was glad to have this DVD in my collection!
B000NA1OXY|1.0|WOW! What a total sell-out. Avril has always been our little grunge girl next door with a punk rock chick sound....but this album is just dirt, and is complete junk. I think it's funny that Avril publicly scorns Britney Spears, and now seems to have generated a sound much like that of Britney's. What is she thinking. These songs are bratty, teeny bopper, and immature. Avril is getting older, and recently married I thought we could expect something different, or atleast something closer to her old sound...but this CD was written by a 12 year old.  <br />The Best Damned thing is one of the worst songs I've ever heard. Horribly commercial, and just begging to sell albums. \\"When you're gone\\" is her attempt at a slow love song, but is horribly written for her voice, and again sounds awful. It sounds like a 5th grade choir singer. And shows just what an awful singer she is.  <br />Her remix of best Damned thing is rap wanna-be, better done by Gwen Stefani. \\" I can do better\\" another of her songs, should be the title of the cd, because she can do better. It's very 4th grade \\"stick your head in doo-doo....and extremely immature, with yelling, and an attempt at being cool because she can say s***. The album is completely stupid and a TOTAL disappointment. Britney's more punk shaving her head than this ridiculous attempt to put an album out. I think it was written, produced, in a day. What's next Avril, a belly ring?
B00003JRCQ|3.0|Glad I read the book before watching the film. There were scenes from the book that could have been included to make the film story line flow better. The actors/actresses were not as believable and didn't seem to fit the descriptions in the book as well. This adaptation of \\"Persuasion\\" was not as good as Ang Lee's \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" (with Emma Thompson) nor Andrew Davies' \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle). <br />If you're not keen on owning this DVD, I'd borrow it from the local library, a friend, or NetFlix before spending money to buy it.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Like most people I saw the No Such thing on MTV years ago and went out and bought the album. Mayer was cute, and had a great voice, and he looked like any regular kid you went to highschool with. I discovered body is wonderland before it became and single and was obsessed with the beautiful song. Still am....all these years later. But, what I did not expect what a musically different, acoustic, and bluesy sound paired with ultra-deep and insightful lyrics. The CD is a journey of highs and lows leading you from one experience to the next of musical gems. I am in love with the mellow and deep tracks late in the album 3x5, back to you, not myself, and the great indoors. There is not a song on this CD that isn't great. That's why when you go to Mayer concerts his fans no the words to songs that weren't singles. His radio singles are often great, but don't quite show the musical versatility his albums dive into. Most labels just want to sell records so they pick the most mainstream stuff. He's got much more where those came from. His albums are great!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|LOVE IT!!! This movie has all my favorite actors - Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman - and is SO romantic and funny and sweet!! Perfect chick flick!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|John Mayer has obviously grown past the pop icon he was chalked out to be with his first single No such thing. Two studio albums later, and we have a new sound, with the same things we loved about him before.  <br />Continuum shows Mayer in a new light, and he's really grown despite what some critics think.  <br />Mayer's range and versatillity on this new CD include Gravity, a bluesy feeling tune, Slow dancing in a burning room- a heart wreching love-falling-apart song that Mayer fans have come to love and expect from him. But,Mayer takes a more political stance in his world with ready-for-radio tunes like Waiting on the world to change, and the up-temp Belief. He also stretched into a \\"fleetwood mac\\" funky sound with Vultures, a song that will have you singing along. I think there is a lot here- very different sounds. There are less slow songs, but still a lot of deep songs with his melancholy echo's like in repair, and dreaming with my eyes wide open. His lyrics translate into poetry, and he prooves he's grown as a musician with more solo's, and more attempts to show his musical talent that he's made on any of his last talents.  <br />I am a huge Mayer fan, and am thrilled with this new album.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|This is the most incredible show I have ever watched...I have never had a show keep me interested for 2 entire seasons...but Supernatural has and my interest in it has only grown.     Season Two is even more amazing than season one. It gets further into the story line and contains less of those episodes that don't relate to the actual plot of the show. Season 2 also seems to have this angsty shadow that hangs over it...the brothers are dealing with a lot more, including things about Sam and the demon, a couple someones who are going to test what they have been taught to believe their entire lives, more loss and heart ache is on the way, and more trouble with the law. Dean is tested in new ways too and you really get to see his commitment to his family, especially his need to always protect his little brother. There are some funny episodes as well as some that might make you cry...and as always Dean is right their with his sarcastic humor.     There are a few new faces this season too...Bobby comes back and is in quite a few episodes...some people from John's past enter the boys life and the boys cross paths with some new \\"special children\\". The end of season two was incredible...and all I can say is thank you Kripke for actually answering some questions and ending things instead of leaving people hanging for 3 0r 4 seasons like other shows do. But for all the questions that are answered new ones come up...I can't wait for Season 3!     The acting was really good in season one...but those boys really turned it up in season two...they grew right along with their characters...its great. Oh and the music...I love 80's music and classic rock...and they kept that up, with a few other things thrown in and its all perfect...they always pick the best songs/music for this show!...I wish they'd release a SOUNDTRACK!!!    Croatoan, Heart, All Hell Breaks Loose 1& 2, Hunted, Born Under a Bad Sign,and Children Shouldn't play with Dead Things are just a few of the best episodes ofthe season!    So definitely check out this series! You wont be sorry!!!
B000BJS4SU|5.0|John Mayer does have a lot of live albums for a guy who just put out his Jr. cd this past fall. But, hey...if you have the chops, and the raw muscial talent than people will listen, even if it's the same tracks. Mostly because he's the king of creative variation. This CD is better than I expected, and more edgy than some of his past albums.  <br />There are old favorites here, but again- he never sings the same song twice, and has a lot of fun with his music! His music is so dam good people buy cd's with the same tracks just to hear them a different way!  <br />
0805047905|5.0|The way the book is structured as a conversation invites the child's active participation in the story.  The repetition in the language is a delight for very young children.  A wonderful book for children who are just discovering the charm of books.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|I am 66 years old and have been listening to Bob Dylan for longer than I can remember. I probably have everything he has ever recorded. This, however, is my favorite Bob Dylan CD of all. He, quite simply, does an outstanding job and pulls at my heartstrings. In my humble opinion, he has never sounded better. I play this each and every morning to get motivated for my day.When Dylan leaves the sunshine of this life, I'm going with him.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Absolutely love it. The images are amazing and I love diaries that show what the photographers went through to get some of the scenes. I recommend it highly. It should be required viewing for everyone to make them appreciate this planet we have.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This movie is a wonderful story.A romanic, and hopeful story.I loved the original movie and the book and this version is just as wonderful.I loved all the stars in this movie,they were all so great and captured the there carectors so well. this movie has love,comedy,and inspiration. truly a clasic move.
0393307050|5.0|I love this series - have read them all five or six times. There are many reviews that summarize  the story of \\"Master and Commander\\" and indeed the many following books. I'd just like to highlight a few points.    About the early 19th century speech idiom and thought processes, so well captured by O'Brian: while these may present difficulty to those who aren't familiar with the writings of that time, they also represent a great opportunity. The O'Brian books are a delightful way to begin to appreciate the charm and subtleties of a long-gone way of life. Read Jane Austen for an appreciation of the overall social framework, for instance. Pick up on the strict codes that governed conduct: some perhaps too macho for today's taste, as where any insult to a gentleman - by a social equal, not by one of the \\"lower orders\\" - called for either an apology or a duel, the duel itself being a formal affair with each man having a \\"second\\" (a supporter) in attendance, the challenged one having choice of weapons. That's why, as Jack and Stephen leave that first concert, they coldly tell each other where they may be found, in the event of one deciding to \\"call out\\" the other. Also, later, when Jack is almost directly accused of cowardice (being \\"shy\\" in 18th/19th century idiom) by James Dillon, Stephen is depressed at the thought of two people he respects shaping up to fight each other.     Yet at the same time, note the courtesy in conversation: see the point early in the Aubrey-Maturin relationship where Jack holds back because he doesn't want to commit the rudeness of questioning a guest about personal matters.  Stephen however picks up on the unspoken question and is happy to tell something of his life story, an indication of their growing mutual esteem.    Then, the technicalities of sailing ships - anyone today who has done some sailing should be able to grasp what's happening fairly readily, but admittedly readers from the prairie states may be on unfamiliar ground. (I confess to an unfair advantage, perhaps, with time in the Royal Navy - no, not in sailing ships! but there are many terms still common today.) The diagrams of a ship's rigging and sails, in the books, should help, and there are passages where O'Brian finds an excuse to give quite a good lesson in \\"the naming of parts.\\" But isn't it a little strange that those who revel in action novels where every detail of modern weaponry is cataloged at length, should be unwilling to ride over the equally complex details of that wonderful creation, the fighting sailing ship, and just enjoy the story? You can always go back over the unfamiliar parts later in learning mode. Dictionaries are for the second time around.    The humor: there is so much of it! Word-play, especially Jack's malapropisms, of which there are many. Of course some rely on the reader already having a general knowledge background. Jack says someone is roaring \\"like a bull in a basin\\" - you have to recognize the Biblical misquote: \\"the bull of Bashan\\" (Psalms, 22:12-13; Amos 4:1). And also in Master and Commander, Jack's wonderfully mangled French lets him down, as so often, when he is told about the Catalan language and says it is a \\"putain\\" - Stephen has to gently correct him, the word for a dialect is \\"patois.\\" Jack says he could swear the other is also a word, \\"I must have heard it somewhere\\" - well, since \\"putain\\" means prostitute, we (and Stephen) are left to speculate just where he heard it! Oh, those sailors when they get a run ashore... Then there are the sly puns - Jack had once been injured by a woman in Deal (a coastal town) hitting him with a smoothing-iron because she did not think her man should be *pressed* - the press-gang was the Navy's way of grabbing unwary landsmen and \\"pressing\\" them into Navy service whether they wanted it or not: but to *press* is also to iron clothes! I strongly suspect O'Brian was tempted to write that his wound was *dealt* him by a woman in Deal, but thought that would be overdoing it.    Another aspect of his word-play is the frequent use of favorite phrases that stem from other well-known authors. Every time we see the phrase \\"remote and ineffectual\\" we're reminded of Belloc's famously amusing poem (see Poetry Archives if it's unfamiliar). Incidentally, Belloc was a keen sailor. Then \\"Expense of spirit\\" is a phrase that surely has its most famous use in that Shakepeare sonnet. And more...and there are probably others that I'm missing because I'm not familiar with the source. But those that one recognizes are pleasant - a kind of sidelong glance from the author as if to say \\"Here's a little smile, if you're a reading person.\\"     An inexhaustible treasure trove of riches. Enjoy!
1400034779|4.0|I am freshman in high school, and I read this book for my ESL class. I had several choices, but I chose this book because I really like mystery. Also, when I first saw this book, it doesn't seem like difficult. However, it is not real mystery. It is just about normal woman detective who lives in Botswana. She investigates such as missing husband, a daughter whose father wants to know whether she has boyfriend or not. However, I and my teammates become like this book because we can feel a warm heart from the main character of this book, Precious Ramotswe. Although she hurts from her ex-husband, she still has warm hearts and thinks about the others. Also, she tries her best to solve her clients' problem. In addition, she is very proud of the fact that she is woman, and she is the only woman detective in Botswana. If you like hard mystery, such as murder, I assume that you would not like this book because my teammates were also disappointed about this book at first. However, if you would like to read a book about a woman who has proud of herself, I strongly recommend this book.

B0002KPIQY|4.0|Cast is excellent, Jolie totally believable. 4 stars because of her.<br />Something bugs me about direction. At times \\"told\\" as documentary, at times overdramatized... It's like director wasn't quite sure how to tell the story.<br />Script also has a few holes in it, for people not familiar with Gia Carangi story - Why wasn't her mother there for her, ever? What happened to her friends? Actually what happened to all the people a person in her 20s has around her? Was her agent not only her second mother but also the only friend?<br />And finally, what was it about Gia that propelled her into stratosphere, just like that?<br />On last note, this film will most likely leave you feeling \\"heavy\\" and depressed.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly defies classification by genre.  Each episode is packed to the brim with exciting (but believable) action sequences, heart-wrenching (but never sappy or maudlin) drama, clever dialogue (that never tries too hard to be so), more laugh-out-loud moments than your average episode of Friends/Raymond/W&G/KoQ/etc., and absolutely breathtaking (but never gratuitous) effects. <br /> <br />Though a science fiction western by setting, Firefly never panders to and is never limited by that framework.  Those designations merely provide a unique and relevant context for the series which is nonetheless character and story driven.  Episodes are never about fanciful technological mumbo jumbo, unlike standard Trek/Gate/Bab5/BG fare.  Every episode is instead an engaging look into the lives of human beings, always life-sized, with human problems that submit to human solutions, all the while taking place in a world lovingly and meticulously crafted in astoundingly intimate detail. <br /> <br />The acting is incredible, and the chemistry between the actors is as authentic as any I've ever seen.  The writing is superbly fresh and compelling.  The soundtrack is gorgeous and seductive, providing perfect ambience and a stark contrast to external views of the spaceship where the main characters live, which are always perfectly silent.  (No show or movie I've ever seen, before or since, has gotten that right.) <br /> <br />Firefly is, by acclamation, the greatest television show ever to be canceled.  I don't hesitate to call it both the best science fiction series and the best western series in the history of television.  Personally, Firefly is in my top two favorite TV shows of all time, the other being Seinfeld, with the order depending on my mood.  If you haven't seen Firefly, you are missing out on one of the finest TV shows ever made.
1594489505|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is a wonderful story-teller and he does not disappoint in this his second novel.  This time he brings us the intermingling lives of several Afghani families over a two-generation span and interfaces their shared and individual experiences against and with the politics, instabilities, warfare, traditions, and cultural \\"givens\\" and taboos of Afghanistan of the last 30 to 40 years.    For those people who still doubt the absolute and grave nature of the submission perpetrated upon Muslim women, this is the book for you.  For those who still mentally marginalize the resolve of jhadists, warlords, and the most fundamentalist Islam sects, e.g., the Taliban, this is the book for you.  For those who have wearily concluded that human suffering and social turbulence in that part of the world is irreconcilable and/or acceptable, this is the book for you.    But for the rest of us, here is a story of love--young love in bloom, selfless love of parenting, deep love that endures.  It is a story of the kind of strength of body and soul that sustains humanity, even in a might-makes-right climate and amid the environs of extreme adversity.  And for some of us news junkies, it is the human, compassionate, and hopeful side of an otherwise media-portrayed dusty, barren, politically-troubled nation.  It is the flesh and blood of today's generations of Afghanis.  Thank you, Khaled Hosseini.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|First of all, the only songs I've heard so far were Aesthetics of Hate and Clenching of the Fists of Dissent, but I was completely blown away.  Why haven't I heard the rest of the album when I could have easily illegally downloaded them, you ask?  Because from the little bit that I have heard, and the rave reviews, it's obvious that Machine Head put so much effort into this record and for that, I owe them my 15 dollars.  So tomorrow morning as soon as I wake up, I'm heading down to FYE and picking up a copy of The Blackening.  This is metal.  Thank the lord! <br /> <br />Being a fan of 80's thrash like Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, I looked down upon Machine Head.  Actually, I even went as far as to saying that they sucked.  I hated their nu-metal sound and I completely forgot about their existance for the last few years.  They've really come out of left field and left my jaw dropping to the floor.  If you like ANY type of metal, you will surely like Machine Head's new sound.

I showed her The Alchemyst and she immediately began reading. At the end of the day the student reappeared in my room having completed the book in under four hours (and completing all assignments). She said it was fantastic and can't wait for the next book. She said she would have to get a copy for herself, I agreed and quickly put my name in my own! Now I look forward to reading it myself tonight.
0446310786|5.0|The daughter of a noted attorney, Harper Lee was born in 1926 in the small town of Monroeville, Alabama.  Although she studied law, she became increasingly interested in writing, and in the 1950s she created a series of semi-fictional, semi-autobiographical writings about the events of her childhood.  Over time, these writings developed into a novel, and she completed TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD in 1959.  Published in 1960, the book not only proved an instant bestseller but received every critical accolade available, including the Pulitzer Prize.  It also proved controversial, and almost fifty years later the American Library Association continues to list it as one of the most frequently challenged and banned books in both the United States and abroad.<br /><br />Told in the form of an extended flashback, the novel unfolds in a series of scenes in which Lee seems intent upon evoking the small challenges and quiet charms of childhood in a small, Depression era southern town.  We are introduced to Scout, our tomboy narrator, and her brother Jem and their playmate Dill, and we join in their summer games: climbing to the treehouse, rolling in a tire, and most particularly their fascination with \\"Boo\\" Radley, a mysterious recluse of unsavory past who has long been a focus of town gossip.<br /><br />Written with remarkable simplicity, it is a charming, often comical tale--but as the story extends it comes to focus not so much upon Scout and Jem as upon their father Atticus Finch, a noted local attorney who is suddenly appointed to defend a black man accused of the vicious rape of a white woman.  And Atticus Finch is a man of rare integrity, quietly but firmly determined to bring the facts of the case to light.  In doing so, he places himself and his children at storm center of a controversy that threatens to tear both his family and community apart and which ends in violence and death.<br /><br />In 1960, with the United States of America embroiled in the Civil Rights movement, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD was considered a political statement.  It proved a lightening rod for controversy, and in truth the novel still speaks to us of the evils of racism.  If this were all, it would be a novel of historical interest and little more.  But that is not the case.<br /><br />The two threads of the story--the children's fascination with Boo Radley and Atticus Finch's defense of Tom Robinson--are not separate portions; they interweave and ultimately dovetail into a seamless whole, remarkable in narrative, brilliant in clarity, to create a portrait of social bigotry counterbalanced by deep humanity, at times monstrous, at times deeply beautiful as only perfect honesty can be.  The characters spring to vivid life; the events unfold with a mixture of the unexpected and inevitable.  There is pain, there is suffering, but there is growth as well, and as the children grow in knowledge and understanding so too does the reader.  It is a remarkable work, not only capturing the texture of life in a small southern town, but bringing its events to a universal level that transcends time and place and touches something that speaks to the best in all of us.<br /><br />Since the novel's publication, Harper Lee has become almost as much a recluse as Boo Radley, seldom appearing in public, even more rarely speaking or writing for publication.  She has never again created a work of this length.  Even so, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD places her at the forefront of American authors.  This is a great novel.  I wish I had written it.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerement, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD was considered a political statement.

B000R7GKQE|5.0|Not since \\"Buffy\\" and \\"Angel\\" have I been this passionate about a TV show! The first season of \\"Supernatural\\" got me hooked, the second season has made this show my new obsession. There is truly nothing else like it on television. The wonderful and complicated relationship between the two brothers, the clever writing and twists in every episode, the humor, the angst, the awesome classic rock soundtrack and last, but not least, the '67 Chevy Impala. There is nothing I don't love about this show. It is so statisfying to watch as it just seems to get better and better with each episode. The show has grown so much in its second season. By taking some risks, introducing some new characters and storylines, and wrapping up old storylines, it still feels fresh and gives you the sense that there are so many more stories to tell. There is a wonderful balance of humor and angst in this tale of the Winchester brothers that could so easily be depressing. These boys have seen it all and have lost everything but each other, yet there's always a sense of hope.  You feel for these brothers and you can't help but love them both with their very different and equally appealing personalities. Jensen Ackles (Dean) usually provides the comic relief with Dean's quotable one-liners and bad habits, while Jared Padalecki (Sam) plays off of him so well with Sam's reactions to his older brother's behavior. This show is most definitely well-cast. Ackles and Padalecki are perfect in their respective roles, are quite the talented actors and have tremendous chemistry. I cannot say enough about this fabulous show! It sounds crazy, but it is so much fun to watch, yet heart-wrenching at the same time. Standout episodes of season 2 are the season opener \\"In My Time of Dying\\", \\"Crossroad Blues\\", \\"Tall Tales\\" (hilarious!), the critically-acclaimed \\"Hollywood Babylon\\", \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\", \\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\", and of course, the two-part finale \\"All Hell Breaks Loose\\". Do yourself a favorand buy this DVD set, then watch season 3 of \\"Supernatural\\" on The CW this fall!

B000B5XZLU|5.0|This is one the strongest efforts by Jamiroquai. He has cretaed his own style which is very recognisable and, of course, he keep persuing it. Jamiroquai is innovative because he is different from others. And, this is true to his every album. <br /> <br />\\"Dynamite\\" is diverse in tempo and includes a number of really good songs. Some of them you may enjoy when you are up in the spirit and need some further drive, the others will serve well when you are a bit down in the mood. The album is recorded very well, both highs and lows. Very well defined bass. The voice sounds very natural. The sound engineering is great. <br /> <br />You will enjoy both the music and the sound. You will hear the details that add to the overall perception of this highly recommended CD. Take time and it will grow on you even more.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|25 years ago, we heard a catchy song and \\"Everybody\\" set the beginning of one of the most prolific careers in World's Pop Music, full of high and downs, and always more surprising than before. Madonna's has no more to demonstrate, She's certainly Lady Madonna. She is just giving us one more sample of her incredible talent to recreate herself as well as classics from the Disco Era. For those who grew up listening to the disco and Madonna's first hits, seemed impossible to be amazed, but her music, sounds newer and newer. It's impossible to ever get tired of listening to it. It sounds disco, rock, pop, techno... but never old. And what can I say about the concept of her show? Even though I have never had the chance to attend one of her concerts, I have bought several of the DVD's, and \\"Confessions Tour\\" is the best... so far. Great songs, great arrangements, incredible choreographies and (I quote) \\"dancers who defy gravity\\", in addition to a Madonna who shows herself as one of the greatest Pop Artist of all times. Whether you like her, her music, or not, you can't deny her talent to put a great show together. If you don't believe me, take your chances and spend 120 minutes watching this DVD.

B00012FXAE|5.0|After achieving huge critical and box office success with 1979's \\"Alien\\", it is surprising that 20th Century Fox didn't rush a sequel into production, although at the time sequels were not so quick to arrive after their predecessors, but still the property was hot and the decision would have made them a lot of money.  On the flip side, if a sequel had been rushed, the story may have suffered which would have lent to reduced box office and possibly the death of the franchise, so it's probably a good thing that Fox exercised patience with this franchise and waited 7 years before releasing the James Cameron directed sequel, \\"Aliens\\" to excited audiences worldwide.    \\"Aliens\\" begins with Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the only surviving member of the Nostromo crew, being discovered by a salvage ship a half century after the events in \\"Alien\\".  Upon arriving on Earth, she discovers that a human colony has been set up on the very planet her former crew had found the creatures on.  Not surprisingly, contact with that colony has been lost, and a squad of Marines are being prepared to be sent to the planet to determine what happened, if there are any survivors, and exterminate whatever creatures are left.  However, the best bet the Marines have for success is if Ripley returns with them to the planet, so after just recovering from her fight with the first alien, and her excessively long sleep, Ripley finds herself face-to-face once more with the creatures of her nightmares.    James Cameron (director of \\"The Terminator\\") was given no small task when he wrote and directed this sequel to the incredible 1979 film \\"Alien\\".  A major decison that Cameron made in creating this movie was changing the tone and type of movie this is from that of its predecessor.  Instead of being a methodical game of cat-and-mouse, relying heavily on atmosphere and the audience's imagination to craft the horror like the first movie, \\"Aliens\\" was a much more action-packed thrill ride with a little bit ofhorror thrown into the mix.  The decision could have been costly by isolating fans of the work Ridley Scott had done on the first film; however, the decision worked out for the best, delivering audiences what is quite possibly a superior movie to \\"Alien\\".  The story was much faster paced, yet still not skimpy on the details or the fear factor, with more action involving the aliens.  Though shadows were not used as heavily in this film as they were in the original, the suspense surrounding when and where the aliens would strike next was equally thrilling to that of Ridley Scott's creation.  The special effects work in this one was better than the original (as it should be considering advancements made during the 7 year gap between films), but the best part about the effects for this movie was the practical effects work that was done to create the massive alien creature known as the Queen.  The effects for that alien is some of the best practical effects seen in almost any movie, and the final fight between the Queen and Ripley is incredibly fun to watch.    The cast, led by Sigourney Weaver (the only returning cast member from the original), was full of talented actors such as Michael Biehn, Paul Reiser, and Lance Henriksen who each brought a depth and reality to each of their characters that is often lacking in action/horror films.  The success of \\"Aliens\\", coupled with that of the first film brought even more acclaim for actress Sigourney Weaver, who solidified her place in the pantheon of great action heroes (or heroines), and even garnered her an Oscar nomination for her work in this film.    \\"Aliens\\" is rated R for violence and language.

B000CNESU8|5.0|Network is a cynical but totally beleivable portrait of network television in the modern age.  Suits and not journalists run network news like it is entertainment.  Ratings points are fool's gold.  Thoughtless climbers stop at nothing for promotion and reward.  Dirty laundry lurks underneath that eventually forces the entertainment gurus to kill the messenger.  This film makes the events that unfold beleivable and eerie.  Turn on your television and you can't be sure anymore what is truth and what is manufactured reality.  It's hard not to be cynical after viewing Network,which sends a shiver down your spine every time you think about what you see and hear today.  Sometimes it seems like celebrity foibles are headline news and in depth reporting of issues is shunted off to public television.  It is no surprise that the powers that be have little use for network news beyond sound bites.  The soft underbelly of the news is revealing in stark reality in this film.  It is a sad commentary on the state of news gathering and packaging.  But you can always watch public television and still get the news and if you need a tabloid fix the network news will still be there.  Only when people say they have had enough will network executives consider a change in programming.  I for one have had enough.
1416914285|5.0|From the moment I picked this book up, I couldn't put it down. It came everywhere with me - from work, to shopping, even to a Yankee game (for the hour before the game)!   <br /> <br />I gave it five stars for not only the story that has been told so far, but the potential that has been set up for the next two books.  I am not an avid reader of Young Adult books, but I have been known to dabble here and there.  I thought it was incredibly genius of Clare to address a topic, homosexuality, that other authors, to my knowledge, have stayed away from.  As a lesbian, I would have greatly enjoyed seeing sexual orientation described in such a fashion while I was growing up, devouring every book I could get my hands on.  She did an amazing job of portraying the subject in a true-to-life manner and I applaud her for that. <br /> <br />Also, anyone who is familiar with New York City will absolutely fall in love with the descriptions and settings that Clare uses.  It makes you feel like you are standing right there with the characters throughout the entire story!  <br /> <br />There were many other aspects of the book, however, that made me give it five stars.  The slow blossoming of all the characters into the adults they would someday become was very entertaining to read.  I loved how Jace opened himself up and Clary started seeing herself as a girl that wanted more than just a friendship from a boy.  Simon, I'm sure, would have preferred that boy to be him, but I don't write Simon off just yet.   <br /> <br />I thought that the dialogue and behaviour of Isabelle, Jace, and Alec were spot on considering the fact that they were adolescents who had been trained their entire lives to fight demons.  They are not your typical adolescent, in that regard, and it is best to keep that in mind.  Isabelle seems to be a girl who likes to work and play equally as hard and I love her as a character.  Alec is quietly in love with his best friend, who is clueless, and if I could, I would just keep him as a pet because he is just too cute and brilliant as a character.  His infamous confrontation with Clary is so emotionally packed that it made me shiver!  Though, I would probably trade Alec to Magnus Bane for an invite to one of his parties, or maybe a dozen!  I'm sure Bane would be more than pleased with the transaction! <br /> <br />As much as I enjoyed the \\"kids\\", I also look forward to finding out more about Jocelyn and Luke and Valentine and Hodge.  Their stories can only get more interesting and I can't wait for the next book to arrive!  This entire WORLD that she has created is sure to please anyone who likes good dialogue, good plot, and fantastic characters!
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|I got to say, I am usually not a person that is big on dialog driven movies, EG, woody allen films.  But, this little film about jaded southern california high school students and their heroin addictions really caught me off gaurd.  Yes, there is action and violence, but the movie has a very intricate dialouge to follow, many words. At times i felt they were reading out of a book.  And the little slams and quirky language that they use, I just don't envision people naturally just being able to play off each other so spontaniously with insults etc, giving this movie and almost short story feel to it.  I felt like I was reading a story, and the pictures were playing the images out for me.  Very unique way of presenting a film, I believe pulled of nicely, with some great camera work as well.  A great independent film, if you like the Movie Kids, Requium for a Dream, or Spun, than this movie might interest you to see.  Check it out.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|In the midst of this television season's coverage of \\"Lost\\"'s fall from grace and eventual comeback and the big waves made by \\"Heroes\\", not to mention the slew of increasingly brazen reality TV saturating the market this gem of a show got lost in the shuffle.  Season one was a solid start for the show, full of monster-and-hottie-of-the-week stories that stood alone while very slowly giving us an inkling of a larger plot at work before ending with a glorious cliffhanger. The music was wonderful, the guest stars brilliant, and the homages to classic and modern horror were thick. If you missed it, now's the time to catch up because season two is a winner in every possible way.  The first episode is among the greatest season openers I've ever had the pleasure of viewing and it shakes this show to it's very core and sets the tone for the entire year's events.  From there, Sam and Dean set out to get revenge for their deceased family members and save as many people as they can along the way.  Second verse, same as the first, right?  Well, no, not quite.  We still get our monsters-of-the-week and our cute guest stars and our classic rock soundtrack, but the tone of this season is so much darker and the events so traumatic that the stakes just seem to be on a whole other level.  Friendships are made and broken, loyalties are tested, long-standing beliefs are challenged, all three Winchesters fight for their very souls, and almost nobody's getting out whole.  This season is a tooth-and-nail battle for survival and while it still has a hefty dose of the humor that made the first season so much fun, it's obvious that this show is no longer just playing around at having a larger plot. This is the real deal.  Among the baddies met along the way are more vampires (one played by an almost unrecongnizable Amber Benson of \\"Buffy\\" fame), a rogue hunter, a living dead girl, a female werewolf (in the most heart-wrenching episode of any show I've seen this season), a deal-making demon for those who remember the legend of Robert Johnson, some of Sam's fellow \\"gifted\\" children (we do learn their secret), and a Norse trickster god to name a few.  The music, if anything, has gotten better this season and so have the guest stars. My favorite guest performance has got to be the loveable Katherine Isabel from cult-classic werewolf flick \\"Ginger Snaps\\" who shows up twice and inspires adoration in every frame she's in.  If you missed this show on the CW, shame on you; now buy this set.  If you missed the first season buy that set too.  This show is so good I'd hate to see it die because nobody bothered to watch it for themselves.  These kinds of shows are notoriously short-lived and the television big-wigs have little patience for them so when one of this caliber gets on the air and stays on the air, we need to keep it that way in every way we can.  Support horror, sci-fi, and fantasy television now, and we'll be rewarded with more later.  I hope.or those who remember the legend of Robert Johnson, some of Sam's fellow \\"gifted\\" children (we do learn their secret), and a Norse trickster god to name a few.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|I haven't viewed all of it yet, but the packaging is great and I have had good luck with everything I've ordered from Amazon. I'm giving it a 5 star rating anyway with confidence.
076790382X|5.0|Bill Bryson has to be one of the 'most readable' authors for folk who prefer a good chuckle. My wife is not so happy and moans about my giggling keeping her awake. <br />Keep up the good work Bill
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This DVD is well worth getting in the Blu-Ray format.  The additional detail is amazing.  A facinating look at nature, some of it, extremely rare.
B00003CXCD|5.0|This is a classic film anD while watching it is like having a tour of Rome, all the sights and famous monuments . If you have ever been to Rome it brings back all the memories of your own Roman Holiday.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|Linkin Park probably disappointed a lot of fans with this album due to the result of their experimentation.  I admit it's not really what I was looking for but I am still satisfied with the album.  In my opinion, Hybrid Theory was by far their best album with a solid line-up of amazing songs.  This one is solid too, but it seems to be aimed at a different audience.  The album is very \\"My December\\"-ish with majority of the songs being mellow but it still keeps a couple songs with their same angsty passion of the previous album in No More Sorrow and Bleed It Out.  Altogether a good album but I won't be listening to it very frequently because there are many other albums I'd rather listen to.
B000067J24|5.0|Charming little romantic \\"Magic Realism\\" tale with a mellow Brazillian soundtrack.  Penelope Cruz was never more lovely.
B000N3ST7K|4.0|Another entertaining soundtrack by Tarantino - well worth having. I'm curious about the version of the Coasters' \\"Down In Mexico\\" though. It's very different from the one on \\"Very Best of the Coasters.\\" I can't tell if it's just remixed or another version entirely. I hope some R&B expert can comment on that. Finally, though, another great collection of very diverse sounds.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Consistantly funny, yet amazingly believable, take on a zombie invasion.  Characters well drawn and full of subtle details that make rewatching fun.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|In my humble opinion this DVD is an amazing eye-opener and should be made accessible to every citizen of the  United States! Better yet, it should be made available to every citizen of the world. We must all be made aware that we all can, in no matter how small a way, contribute to the lessening of Global Warming, to assure the existence of future generations, and of our world.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a wonderful set of DVD's. It is spectaculer to watch. People of any age from young kids, even teenagers, and adults enjoy it and watch in awe. Keeps your attention with scenary and animals one would never see. Would recomend it for anyone.
B000P2A256|5.0|I just loved this CD it is far better than their first album. Although I do love Songs About Jane, this CD is a lot more mature and grown than their freshmen one. One of their best song is \\"Won't Go Home Without You\\" a soulful ballad that pierces the heart, for those hopeless romantics. \\"Wake Up Call\\" is just another hit, just wonderful. I do think that Adam Levine the lead singer explores with his voice, which I find beautiful. I really recommend this album.
032147404X|5.0|I enjoyed the book from cover to cover and caught myself laughing out loud on occasion.  The clear cut and simple strategies provided by the author are priceless to anyone interested in picking up a camera and walking away with a decent shot.
B000E5KJES|5.0|After picking up The Departed in HD DVD, I got a hankerin for more Scorsese. I wasn't aware that Goodfellas had been released in HD DVD until I caught it out of the corner of my eye at my local Target. I was thrilled and the movie didn't dissapoint. It's as captivating as it was when I first saw it, and now it's been polished for the new era in home theater. Beautiful visuals and crisp sound. A must-have for HD DVD <br /> <br />If you loved Goodfellas when it first came out, get this, you owe it to yourself.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|I just love this album.  Didn't think it could get better than her debut....it did.  I was instantly hooked and listen to it all the time.  My Song is my fave.
0765315246|4.0|I found this an enjoyable, quick read. Interesting concepts and execution. It is not as deep as the Ghost Brigades, but well worth the read.
0066620996|4.0|A great account as to what these great companies had to do to jump ahead of their competition and dominate the general market. The author along with his research team used statistical data to show the systematic approach that these companies took to success. I was really surprised at which companies were featured in this book, companies such as Nucor, and Pitney Bowes werent really the giants that i expected when i disocered what this book was about, but in the book it offers great detail as to what they did to turn themselves around. The book mentions the tenacity of the CEO's, the determination of the board, and the daring journey these companies took to excel. In the end of the book the reader figures that the companies did nothing complicated at all but simply use smart and simlpe business practices, but the most interesting thing i saw was the direct similarities between all these companies A great book worth reading
B00000K3D4|2.0|This film was designed for staging an elaborate puppet show. The acting of the two main human actors is wooden, and the plot is shallow at best. The film's interest is harmed because of the slow pace. Fine work by the late Jim Henson, but beyond that, it just doesn't hold the viewer's attention.
B000P0I4O4|3.0|Enjoyable if not derivitive thriller with perfunctory performances by leads Morgan Freemand and John Cusack.  The storyline is thin, the characters are thin, but the film is beautifully shot, had some wonderful set pieces (the cliff scene) and some moments of nice suspense and action.  A few of the action sequences are extremely well executed and surpisingly quite thrilling.  On the downside, the movie definitely plays it too safe, there's certainly nothings screaming \\"extraordinary\\" in any sense, and is lacking verisimilitude.  Still, it's a pleasant and very scenic journey, has some memorable moments, and John Cusack and Morgan Freeman even when only mediocre are still always fun to watch on screen.
B00005JMK0|5.0|One of the best 'computer takes over' movies out there with a love story sub-plot (or is it the main plot :). I have this on VHS from a move-of-the-week recording. All the 'original' VHS copies out there are either ex-rentals or very used. I've been looking for years for a good clean copy. <br /> <br />We need a remastered DVD of this classic movie please!
B000OMD4BG|5.0|I have heard these songs before but never so clear an crisp. It is a gift to hear these songs in this light and I recommend any fan of Elliott to pick up this album. I particularly recommend the track \\"Going Nowhere\\" as it is truly haunting and completely introspective. If you love Elliott, this is a must have!
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I have been hooked on Supernatural since the Pilot episode.  The story of Sam and Dean told against the background of hunting ghoulies and ghosties is heartwrenching and fascinating. Season 2 is by far better than season 1.  There's angst galore.  But through it all the strong love between Sam and Dean and their determination to protect each other through everything that comes their way is what really keeps you tuning in every week.  Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles bring Sam and Dean to life with their fabulous acting and amazing chemistry.  And the 2 part season ender is probably the best I've ever seen.  Eric Kripke is a genius who has taken some real chances with his heros and it has worked wonderfully.  He has really dragged Sam and Dean through the wringer and I can't wait to see what happens next season.
0374105235|5.0|This book was well written describing the life of a young boy who was forced into being a soldier at an earlier age and how he had turned his life around.  He looks back and remembers the war and the things he did to others. As you read this book, you will not be able to put it down.
B000255LNE|5.0|Love classical music.  Never heard of Phil Collins till I heard him on a Youtube video.  What a talent!  Highly recommend this album.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|WOW!! Pretty much sums it up. I can't get enough of these guys. I'd been hearing about Nightwish for the last couple of years, and now I understand the buzz.  <br /> <br />They've created a sound all their own, blending classical, keyboard-based composition, crunchy guitars, and a truly gorgeous operatic female voice into a very heady brew. Some people have said the combination doesn't work. To each his own. For me, it works amazingly well. The talent is topnotch.  <br /> <br />Two songs I especially love: Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan  - - simply enchanting. Sung in Finnish by the amazing Tarja (now departed from the band to pursue opera in Germany, I heard), it's like nothing I've ever heard before. Dark Chest of Wonders - - can't stop singing or humming it. Impossibly catchy.  <br /> <br />&lt;sigh>This band has it ALL: class, style, musicianship, songs, stunning vocals, and, for those who appreciate a bit of eye candy on the live stage (I do, and won't apologize for it) - - that celebrated beauty which denizens of the cold Viking north seem so effortlessly blessed with. I'm excited about the debut of their new singer, this current tour stateside. Following on the heels of a voice like Tarja's, she's got her work cut out for her. I wish her all the best!! <br /> <br />Somethin' for everybody, here.  I warn ya, this music will grow on you.
B000002I8D|5.0|What can I say?  It's Phil Collins, and it's wonderful.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|The Holiday is a cute and yet predictable film about two women who will do anything and go anywhere to get over their recent heartbreaks. Winslet's character is a hopeless romantic, her boyfriend gets engaged to another woman and decides to swap her house for two weeks with a lonesome American, Cameron Diaz does a wonderful job, she keeps getting better and better with each film. Amanda (Diaz) has discovered her boyfriend has been cheating on her with his receptionist, he blames Amanda saying she pushed him away and that's why he strayed. Deciding to start anew, Amanda and Iris (Winslet) change their scenery and lives. With that being said, eventually both ladies find love again, I won't spoil the rest but The Holiday isn't a perfect film but it's darn close. Enjoy!
B00004VXF2|5.0|I own four copies of this recording on three different media: LP (framed, on the wall), 8-Track (still sealed), CD (early eighties Japanese bootleg that I shoplifted around 1986 or so) and now this package.  It's obviously one of my favorite records.  If you listen to most of the other reviewers here I guess that makes me either psychotic (at worst) or a hopeless geek (at best).  But I don't necessarily love it for the \\"music\\".  I find that I'm fascinated by Lou's complete and utter rejection of commercial success and conformity.  Only Van Morrison worked harder to push success away (but, of course, made arguably better art doing it). <br />It is my understanding, from reading just about every Lou Reed/Velvet Underground biography ever printed, that MMM was not entirely a joke nor entirely a \\"middle finger\\" to the fans or RCA.  Lou had to make one more record to fulfill his contract and RCA was pushing him for it.  So he sat down and made this recording of squealing feedback.  RCA was skeptical but Lou had a reputation (rightly or wrongly) for being edgy so he was able to convince them of it's merit so thoroughly that they wanted to release it on their classical music label.  In a interview by Lester Bangs Lou claimed he talked them out of that because (here's the real joke...) he thought that would be pretentious! <br />Lester Bangs also wrote a sometimes irony-free article suggesting that MMM was the best album ever made.  That article is the reason I searched out and stole that CD copy all those years ago.  Now, I can't say, as Lester did that, \\"I take [MMM] about once a day, like vitamins\\"  but I will say that if you actually listen to MMM it is pretty interesting, especially through headphones.  The screeching noise through the two stereo channels is almost hypnotic and if you listen long enough you'll swear there are voices in there.  All that said though, is there any reason a regular ol' Sweet Jane loving Lou fan should own this?  Well, I guess not.  Exceptmaybe as an historical artifact or it is useful as a late-night-party-ender.  There are those of us though who, for whatever reason, have risen above being just a Regular ol' Lou fan and have morphed into something more... more... Cynical, I guess.  I mean I would rather listen to MMM a hundred times than be forced to hear The Raven even once.  Geez, which album is the joke here, huh? <br />Bottom line is, if you're only a Lou Reed dabbler or if you have Lou albums AND Coldplay albums don't bother with MMM.  Me, though?  I plan on playing it at my wedding, during my first dance with the new mother-in-law. <br />By the way, Metal Machine Music was recently resurrected and transcribed by Zeitkratzer, a ten-piece German orchestra ensemble, for a live performance at the Berlin Opera House, and Reed was invited for a guitar solo.  So, there are other masochistic goons out there too.
B000NIVJHM|5.0|Dirty Dancing (20th Anniversary Edition) is still the best and sexiest dance film I have ever seen. Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey sizzle, smolder, and set the screen on fire with their undeniable chemistry. It's kinda funny since both stars couldn't stand each other off camera. I am so glad I waited 'til this new edition came out, great special features. Watch the deleted scene where they really dirty dance in Swayze's bungalow, it's hot, hot, hot!!!!!!!!!!!! This movie is a classic and everyone should own this tender film about first love, trusting those you're afraid to trust, and having the time of your life. I highly recommend it!
1594489505|5.0|You don't just read this book, you experience it.  Hosseini has succeeded in giving us a novel that is at once universally accesible and empathetic and insightful about a particular place and time.  It had me trembling. It has no false notes---it rings true from start to finish.  Hosseini has done a beautiful job capturing the subtle joys and triumphs that are possible despite the terrible atrocities and tragedies the characters endure.  So much so, that the beauty of love is almost shocking in contrast.  This book also offers such complex charatcters and circumstances that it provokes contemplation andintrospection.  It doesn't allow the reader to make sweeping generalizations about the place, the people, or even, the political forces in the book.   In the end, it left me profoundly grateful to be a woman in the US.
B000P2A256|5.0|Reading reviews from people who go to great lengths to say how \\"over it\\" they are when a band (god forbid) changes their musical direction a bit and produces a follow-up to a hugely successful album that dares to be different than its predecessor crack me up.<br /><br />If the only Maroon 5 set you ever want to hear is SAJ, then don't ever buy any others, just keep listening to that.  I loved Songs About Jane, I loved their live acoustic CD's, and I love their new CD.  So what if a lot of their lyrics are about love gone wrong - we live in a country where more relationships fail than flourish, so most of us can relate to the lyrics.  That they are able to capture the emotions associated with it (anger, bitterness, revenge, sadness, acceptance) in such a wide variety of musical styles speaks to the strength of their creativity, and that they channel some greats in the process (yes, Won't Go Home does have an Every Breath You Take-like guitar riff) is awesome.<br /><br />I won't go song-by-song, but there are so many great tracks on this CD - catchy, lyrically clever, tightly produced - that the fact that there are a couple filler tracks is largely unimportant.  You can't find hardly anyone who doesn't hum along to Makes Me Wonder, and I'd venture to say that several more tracks from this CD - If I Never See Your Face Again, Little of Your Time, Won't Go Home Without You, Can't Stop, Kiwi, Back at Your Door - are also major hit single potential.<br /><br />There's no point in whining that your favorite best-kept-secret band hit the bigtime and is writing for a larger audience - all of their material they've done has been great in different ways, and this CD is going to be huge.  Can't wait to see 'em live again.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|This is Pearl Jam's best studio effort since Yield, and definitely worth a look for past and present fans of this classic band.
B00000J7J4|5.0|As a sixty-something year old musician and guitarist who still gigs, I am truly amused by all those folks who love an artist's work SO much, they think time, and the artist should stand still. I have been a fan of Santana's since he first broke out, and I have every album he's ever made...and listen to them frequently. I also love SUPERNATURAL! I especially love his collabo's with younger artists. He's not so much reaching out to them, as he is bringing them into his world. If you are the kind of listener who wants to know before you open the jewel box what you will hear, Carlos is simply not for you. He has always experimented, and grown. Some of his \\"experiments\\" are lifelong companions, others don't work as well as they might. So what? As to all those who have the nerve to call Carlos Santana a sell-out simply because he has been successful, I remind you all, that this master is wealthy enough to never have to record or gig again in life, and that he does it for the sheer joy of it! I hear in this album his incredible joy at trying something else, and loving it. Rock on Carlos!
0143038419|5.0|this is my new favorite book (i have purchased multiple copies to distribute to friends)... a very touching, personal account of one woman's journey, written with a sense of humor & in a way everyone can relate to & gain something from no matter who they are & where they are in their journey in life.
B000P2A256|5.0|The first Maroon 5 tune I heard was Makes Me Wonder (love the video) and I knew I wanted to hear more.  I immediately bought the new CD when it was released ( I also bought SAJ) and I most definitely am loving every bit of it. I love Adam Levine's voice. The band's unique sound sets them apart from a lot of the other bands that are out there. And for all of those special people who are disillusioned because this CD isn't as good as SAJ, according to their individual standards, I say it's a good thing it isn't,why should it be. I think it's idiotic to expect any singer or band to continue to put out CD's that achieve meteoric success. If they stayed the same it means they aren't growing, and no one wants to remain the same. I say ROCK ON MAROON 5!!!
0425152251|1.0|I've never written a review on Amazon before, even though I love Amazon, it's great, and have been using it for years.  However.  I honestly felt the need to post this, after I saw the rating this book has been given. <br /> <br />This book is terrible. <br /> <br />On the back of this book, if memory serves me right, some critic called it a tour de force.  That is completely, inexcusably wrong.  It is not a tour de force.  It's a tour de vomit, i.e., if you took a tour of the history of vomit, sludged through it, then you would have also experienced this book.  It is just terrible.  The \\"plot\\" with \\"Sophie\\" that runs through the entirety of this book made me physically cringe.  I felt embarrassed for both myself and the author.  I hid the cover so that no one could see what I was reading.  I only finished it because I am a diligent student who finishes what he starts.  Like Jumanji.  I had to do it.  I almost wanted to see just how godawful this book could get. <br /> <br />When I finished it I felt like I had just slept with my mother. <br /> <br />If you want to learn about different philosophers' philosophies, then go to a library or use wikipedia.  Wanting to know about the history of philosophy is a noble endeavor, wanting to read this book is not.  Sophie's World reads like it was written by something the cat dragged in.  Something a very boring, uncreative, and morbidly obese cat dragged in.  Jostein Gaarder must have some sort of brain-wasting disease.  If that is true, then I feel bad for him and I'm sorry for being so harsh.  If it is not true then he should be deeply ashamed of himself.  And he should issue a public apology for writing this... thing. <br /> <br />I'm certain the SW fans are going to tag this review as unhelpful, and that's their thing, but to YOU, the potential reader of this book, I beg you, do more research, don't read this book!  If there are any spelling errors in this review it is only because I read Sophie's World and became stupider because of it.
B0000009SF|5.0|Frank Zappa And The Mothers Of Invention-The Grand Wazoo *****<br /><br />A previous reviews have stated Frank Zappa belongs to a select few composers of jazz that surpass all the rest and are among some of the most talented musicans ever, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Duke Ellington, Frank Zappa. Now, and really even during his career Frank Zappa was mostly known for his satirical comedy in his lyrics and his vituosic guitar playing which is fine and good because he was amazing at both, however Zappa was also one of the greatest arrangers of classical and jazz that the world has ever known, as well as one of the most inventive and innovative, and that is often disgarded and overlooked, and The Grand Wazoo does a wonderful job of showing all of showing all of Zappa strong suits.<br /><br />The Grand Wazoo was released in 1973 as part of the tilogy of albums begining with the legendary classic Hot Rats, continuing with the brilliant Waka/Jaka, and concluding here with The Grand Wazoo. While not the overwelming classic that Hot Rats is this is far superior in composistion and form. More mature and thought out even though most of this is 'free form/improv' though not much was ever improv with Zappa other then guitar solos. While this is more orchastral then Hot Rats it is more like Waka/Jawaka, and once again this album is superior in all the techincal ways of playing and composition and form, however the other two albums in the genra are favorites above this one. Doesnt make since does it. See while this one is most innovative and revolutionary it does not compare to the other albums as a whole.<br /><br />Zappas playing as far as guitar playing goes is nothing short of breath taking here, not that it ever is, but this album shows a more adventurous nature to Zappas playing one that had not been heard by him before and he had tried after The Grand Wazoo but was never able to reach this level of experimentation with such success again.<br /><br />As composing goes this is possibly his strongest album in that area. The songs, well piecces of music rather are so of his most original and interesting. The time signatures and molodic lines and harmonies are out of this world. Zappa was really on a role with The Grand Wazoo.<br /><br />Aside from Zappa himself Sal Marquez owns the trumpet here and shines like never before or since. This album may contain the most talented and cohesive group of musicians ever assembled together to play on a Zappa album, which explains the incredible results. Aynsley Dunbar, Don Preston and George Duke all in the same room playing together...are you kidding, there is no way this album would be anything short of phenonomal!<br /><br />For jazz fans and Zappa fans alike this is an album not to pass up. This is the album Miles Davis wishes he would have made with Bitches Brew!sing goes this is possibly his strongest album in that area.

B000001EL7|5.0|Like a sister to \\"Rock and Roll Over\\" - \\"Love Gun\\" offers more blistering live in the studio rock. To me, the highlight here has to be \\"Shock Me\\" and not just because it's the first song Ace sings, but because of that SOLO! It's one of his best solos ever! But \\"Love Gun\\" \\"Christine Sixteen\\" \\"Got Love for Sale\\" and \\"I Stole Your Love\\" are all Kiss classics! One of Peter's best songs, \\"Hooligan\\" - which is even better live is found here. This album really showcases each of the four members very well. I know they started really battling each other at this point, but the music didn't suffer (yet). The only other thing I have to say is why oh why have they never played \\"Almost Human\\" live? That songs absolutley rips!!!
B00000J7SS|4.0|Miles Davis-Bitches Brew ****<br /><br />Long held as one of if not the greatest jazz album of all time. This was released in a time of revolution, the civil rights movement was basicaly still in height and change was happening everywhere. Jimi Hendrix redifined guitar and a group of white boys from England named cream were making black music better then some of the blacks were making it at the time. Jazz was changing around the genius that is Miles Davis and had been for a while and he was ignoring it. That was until he sat down and realized how stubborn he was being and caught up. He had long since given up on Coltrane as many did only to later realize his later work was far superior to that of his early material, as did many others in the world.<br /><br />Some will tell you that this album is outragious and nothing special and even tell you that it is Miles worst album, others will hail this as utter genius and concider this his all time best rivaling the amazing Kind Of Blue, or even Coltranes phenomonal A Love Supreme. Well nither the former or the latter are correct. While this is one of the most important and very best albums in all of jazz and all of music really this is far from Davis' best and far from rivaling the two for-mentiond albums.<br /><br />What Miles did here was as previously stated give in to his own inhabitions and embrace what he had for so long wrote off as nothing moro then a mere joke. Miles went from classic form jazz right head first into electric and free from like it was nothing. And for someone of his stature it was nothing. In this genre of jazz this album fails in comparison to other albums of its kind, so then why is it so important and revolutionary then? Well it saved Miles career and showed his willingness and flexability to grow as a artist and musician.<br /><br />The first disc of Bitches Brew containing 'Pharaohs Dance' and the title track 'Bitches Brew' are very simular in song structure, changes, mood, and even in tone. Being as this album was pieced together from several free form jazz jams it is possible that some of these are from the same jam. The first disc fails in direction and in excitment. The jams here are way to long for not having focus and can lose a new listener easily.<br /><br />The second disc containing 'Spanish Key' 'John McLaughlin' 'Miles Runs The Voodoo Down' 'Sanctuary' and now 'Feio' s much stronger and much more focused. Aside from that disc two is much more interesting and is why this essential for all listeners. It is phenomonal with no other word possible for explaination. It must be heard to be fully appreciated. The playing by Miles and the rest on the album is stronger on this disc and is just all around better.<br /><br />So is this an essential album for jazz and for Miles Davis, yes, but is this as revolutionary as has been made to seem, certainly not, but that is not to take away from the sheer greatness of this album. You may be wondering why if this album is \\"sheer greatness\\" it would only recieve four stars from me well because as great as it is the legend that is Miles Davis could have done much better and did do much better. Essentail!nd even in tone. Being as this album was pieced together from several free form jazz jams it is possible that some of these are from the same jam. The first disc fails in direction and in excitment. The jams here are way to long for not having focus and can lose a new listener easily.  <br /> <br />The second disc containing 'Spanish Key' 'John McLaughlin' 'Miles Runs The Voodoo Down' 'Sanctuary' and now 'Feio' s much stronger and much more focused. Aside from that disc two is much more interesting and is why this essential for all listeners. It is phenomonal with no other word possible for explaination. It must be heard to be fully appreciated. The playing by Miles and the rest on the album is stronger on this disc and is just all around better. <br /> <br />So is this an essential album for jazz and for Miles Davis, yes, but is this as revolutionary as has been made to seem, certainly not, but that is not to take away from the sheer greatness of this album.

B000001EKX|4.0|...That was initially supposed to be the title of this record until they decided on \\"Hotter Than Hell\\". Again, I think this is a great record for the songs it contains, but sonically, KISS was going for a harder edged sound, and some of them are really good, but some sound too distorted. But, awesome tunes on this one. The title track, \\"Got to Choose\\" \\"Parasite\\" \\"Let me Go R+R\\" to name a few. My favorites and lesser known gems are \\"Stange Ways\\" - written by Ace and sung by Peter - what a shame they didn't do that one live! Also, \\"Comin Home\\" and \\"Mainline\\"  are cool riff rockers. Recently, they did \\"All the Way\\" on their Rock the Nation tour and it sounded great.
B000002LKU|5.0|The Notting Hillbillies (four pals from England: Mark Knopfler, Guy Fletcher, Steve Phillips and Brendan Croker) was a bluegrass band formed in the late 1980s. In 1990 they released Missing...Presumed Having a Good Time, their first and last album. That fact alone is a shame because Missing is just so good.    The track list is a mixture of old, old bluegrass/blues numbers and original compositions written by the band members - Knopfler's signature guitar work is heard clearly on several of the tracks, especially the mournful \\"Feel Like Going Home\\" finale. What makes this CD so special is the unpretentious mood and feel that you get from the songs - it's the perfect album for just relaxing and having a good, easy time.    The liner booklet includes lyrics for each song, and a photo of each band member, and if my memory serves me, I think the lyrics are written down pretty correctly for each song.    It is difficult to pick a favourite song, but the real stand-outs are the atmospheric \\"Railroad Worksong,\\" bluesy \\"Your Own Sweet Way\\" (Knopfler's original), \\"Will You Miss Me,\\" calypso pastiche \\"One Way Gal,\\" the wonderful \\"Weapon of Prayer\\" and of course the weepy \\"Feel Like Going Home.\\"    You won't find banjos or fiddles, but you will find plenty of heart and just simply good music. The word for this album is \\"laid back.\\" It's one of those few CDs that rank on my essentials list, and I would recommend it to anyone.
B000001EL3|5.0|Destroyer is excellent. Arguably the best Kiss record. It has it all. \\"Detroit Rock City\\" \\"King of the Night Time World\\" \\"God of Thunder\\" of course \\"Beth\\" and \\"Shout it Out Loud\\" - and my favorites \\"Sweet Pain\\" and \\"Flaming Youth\\" and \\"Do You Love Me\\". This saw Kiss hit their first snag with Ace as he was replaced by Dick Wagner on \\"Sweet Pain\\" and \\"Beth\\". But, oh well. Bob Ezrin was a genius on this. This record made Kiss bigger than life. The songs matched their personas. These songs because the soundtrack for their shows and generations of fans. It is interesting to think what would have happened if Kiss had followed up this record with another Ezrin produced album...?

B00005JPD0|5.0|Excellent film. Alittle different from what Denzel would usually do but it was great. For a sci-fi flick, it was not corny at all. I've rented this film but I plan on adding it to my home collection of movies asap!:)
074356619X|5.0|Fantastic reading.  <br />There are many many that has very knowledgeable points of views. <br />All positive action and reineforcement of what we all should be doing through our lives. The Secret is well worth reading. <br />I love it so much that I am listening to the cd's 2-3 times a week just <br />for the positive reinforcement of the \\"Laws of the Universe\\". <br />If you want something to happen in our Life or to make changes in our Life...you should be using the Secret!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Words cannot do justice to the amazing footage that the planet earth series show us.  I am extrememly happy with this purchase, great buy for anyone who loves to learn more about the earth they live in.  One note: I specifically purchased the BBC version and not the Discovery version due to David Attenborough narrating the BBC version and Sigourney Weaver (who I did not really enjoy) narrated the Discovery version, so I guess it is up to your preference.
1400063515|3.0|In a remarkably long-winding book with numerous supposed-to-be-insults against anything French (may be the jokes were written during the 'Freedom Fries' movement), Taleb just about manages not to squander his reputation from his previous book.  The point(s) made by the author is no doubt a refreshing look at how things \\"evolve\\" (they only jump).  But the background discussion about that single point, however important it is, is painfully long and very tangential at times.  Very unorthodox methods for eliciting reader interest include 'citing' examples about a fictitious author.  Some of the points regarding observation biases mentioned in the book can be obtained in any traditional book on behavioral finance as well. Regardless, the book is an above-average but laborious read. Fans of the first book may be disappointed at the seemingly tangential discussions in this book - a black swan of sorts for the author.
B0001907DA|5.0|Police Academy is a fine example of humor taken to the level of ridiculous.  The many levels meld nicely together.
014100018X|2.0|I realize this book is a fairy tale and the standards have to be a little different. I am obviously not the audience that this book was intended for and the audience that was captivated by it.  I did not believe the plot or the setting.  If there had been a little more magic, I might have bought it.  It seemed to me to be a collection of cliches from other stories. As the author had actually lived in France, I hoped for a little more realism.  I've read about the anti-Catholic bias in film and books and generally dismissed it as over reaction, but I thought this book had an offesively clear anti-Catholic bias.  The men don't come out very well either.
B0002SROT0|5.0|Elliot Smith is one of the great musicians of our time.  This album is the last of his recordings before his death.  Each song is delivered with the tortured whisper that Smith is so often trademarked for.  Delivering his thoughts with both clarity and subtle emotion this album is an insight into his tortured soul.  The album is suprisingly more distorted than most of his work.  He voices anger with the bewildering screech of his elctric guitar.  The most impressive song is 'Kings Crossing.'Its smoothe organ and stunning percusion evoke both a mood of agression and haunting beaty.  Overall this album is most impressive in its depressing lyrics that speak true with ever word.  This album is a man on the edge of insanity.  It is his gift to us that we may begin to understand him through his music.
B00005JPM0|3.0|Another breathtaking exercise in vulgarity from Euro-trash schlockmeister Vorhoeven. Even the furnishings appear to be dripping in slime. Lovers of high camp should follow the chocky bar as it will have special significance in one of many outrageous plot twists. Any film that makes \\"The Boys From Brazil\\" look tasteful must have something going for it.
0066620996|5.0|Good to Great is one of the best business books I have read.   The book is well researched and the conclusions give you a lot to think about.     After writing \\"Built To Last\\", where he showcased companies that were built well from the beginning, and possessed the write DNA from the day they were opened for business, he was approached by someone that told him that he found his book completely useless because the book implied that if the business didn't have the \\"right stuff\\" from the foundational period it was somehow doomed.   Mr. Collins was intrigued by the comment and decided to investigate companies that were once bad, mediocre, or just plain good, and that eventually became great.  The companies that made the cut outperformed the general market for at least fifteen years.   Only eleven companies made the list.  Then he picked comparison companies that were in the same field, with similar market conditions, that did not performed as well.   The result is an almost scientific report on the leadership, disciplines and culture that made those eleven companies go from good to great.      When I read a book, I typically highlight points that I find interesting and or useful.   For most books, if I can come up with a couple good ones, I consider the reading of the book a worthwhile investment.   With this book I was able to extract 27 points.     It is worth noting that many of the conclusions that make great companies can also help the individual become great.   I would, therefore, recommend this great book, to not only people in business, but also to individuals that have a desire to become great.

B000IJ79WU|4.0|I was one of the thousands of Superman fans who had petitioned Warner Brothers to release this material.  I always thought that Richard Lester's version of this film was enjoyable and well-made, but I'm also a bigger admirer of the style established by Dick Donner for the original film.  The prospect of seeing all of the Marlon Brando material, seeing some of the story as it was originally written, and seeing the entire film in the Donner style was a tempting prospect indeed.  I've just now seen this film (via a Netflix rental), and walked away with mixed feelings. <br /> <br />First, the good.  Most (not all) of the restored Donner material is fascinating.  Yes, Brando's performance here is more pomp and circumstance than it is substance, but it's still wonderful to be able to see all of it.  The sequences involving Superman voluntarily relinquishing his powers (and then later regaining them) have more meaning and impact than they did in the Lester cut, and in many ways, they make more sense.  The sequences involving Lois Lane's suspicion that Clark Kent has a secret identity are (almost) completely \\"new\\"; at first, I was a bit off-put by the bizarre aggressiveness of Lois' tactics compared to the Lester cut, but upon further reflection, I decided that this tenacity fit in perfectly with her character. In any event, they were great fun to watch. <br /> <br />Now, the bad.  As much fun as it is to be able to finally see all of this material in one place, the film in its totality is a bit of a mess.  Donner did not shoot all of the required scenes for Superman II, so there were portions where he and his producer/editor Michael Thau had no choice but to use the Lester material.  In the documentary that accompanies the film, Donner admits that it was difficult for him to even watch the Lester material, so most of the final editing was (presumably) turned over to Thau, who seemed to have been given the direction to use as little of it as possible.  The result tells thestory adequately, but seems disjointed and abbreviated in places, as other reviewers have noted. <br /> <br />I have no doubt that if Donner had originally shot 100% of the film and had all of that material available, the result of this retroactive cut would have come across far better.  I also have no doubt that my familiarity with the Lester cut influenced (most likely subconsciously) my expectations of the Donner cut.  And I, like many other reviewers, did not care for the ending -- which, we're told, is the original ending that was penned by Mario Puzo at the time that the films were first written.  The deus ex machina of the \\"super-kiss\\" has been replaced by an even more blatant attempt to wrap up an inconvenient unresolved plot point.  At least the consequences of the \\"super-kiss\\" were a bit more localized in scope! <br /> <br />Still, despite all of this, I'm giving this DVD four stars for the following four reasons: 1) The child-like, goofy grin that I had on my face when watching all of this \\"new\\" material that we fans have been requesting for years. 2) The ability to see the storyline of Superman II in the style of Richard Donner (albeit imperfectly). 3) A generous helping of extras, including even more restored Donner scenes that were not used in the final cut, a brief featurette, and full-length commentary from Donner and and creative consultant Tom Mankiewicz.  4) The fact that Warner Brothers even released this DVD at all. <br /> <br />It is impossible to overstate the last point; the fact that this cut was ever assembled and released to the public is a perfect example of digital democracy in action.  Warner Brothers would never have done this had it not been for the thousands of us out on the Internet who demanded it.  It would have been very easy for them to ignore such requests, but they didn't.  For that reason, I'm going to purchase my very own copy in the hopes that any future requests of this nature will be proven to be financially viable options for Hollywood.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Love, love, love this CD! The song Rosie's Lullaby takes my breath away! This CD is not background music. Every song is expertly crafted. Her voice is an instrument, part of the arrangement - not just sung over the top of the music. She does not over-embellish and always leaves you wanting more.
032147404X|4.0|<br />I really liked this book. It is some sort of photography for dummies, but it touches some of the fundamentals that we are all supposed to know, but forgot about it. It also has a couple of nice product recommendations.
1594489505|5.0|I think Khaled Hossieni has just become my favorite author. Just like in his first novel, I learned more about a part of the world that prior to reading I knew or cared very little about. And also just like his first novel I learned that there are real people in Afganistan, human beings just like myself, that have to live in a war-torn, violent, unforgiving, male dominated, poverty stricken, etc. society.    <br /> <br />The best way that I can describe this book is that it is depressingly educational and entertaining. On the surface it is the story of two women whose lives come together by fate. But really it is a book about Afganistan, it's culture and unfortunatley the downfall of the country. Within the pages of this book you will learn a brief history of the country, it's religous factions and it's culture. It is certainly one of those books that make you thankful that you live in a free society. More importantly it makes you grateful that you are not a woman living in Afganistan. Just like THE KITE RUNNER, you learn what a bunch of thugs the Taliban really are. If you enjoyed THE KITE RUNNER then you will certainly enjoy this book just as much. I would say they are equally awesome. <br /> <br />I thought the book started off great, then I thought maybe it slowed a tiny bit. I remember thinking to myself during this time that Hossieni's first novel was going to be much better.  But just past the half-way point it became awesome. I literally could not put it down nor could I read or turn the pages fast enough to find out what was going to happen.  <br /> <br />This book is beautifully written. It is very well organized and coherent. All the chapters and sections within each chapter fit and tie in together perfectly.  I love how he uses things early in the book that you don't think much of at the time, only later to be brought back at the end to have enormous meaning and symbolism. I thought the characters were real and believable for the most part and you reallyfeel for them. <br /> <br />The majority of this book is sad and depressing. Ironically, I do not like sad books or sad movies but I have to admit that this book was the exception. When I finished reading the book I remember shutting it and saying to myself out loud, \\"Wow, that was a great book!\\" I really enjoyed it and once again, I am already waiting for his next book.
B000LXHK22|3.0|About 18 months ago, in my review of Peter Mayle's \\"A Good Year,\\" I likened the book to a helping of cotton candy, a silly confection that may satisfy a temporary sweet tooth, but cannot satisfy a real appetite.  It was with no small trepidation, therefore, that I sat down to watch the film version directed in 2006 by Ridley Scott.<br /><br />One hundred and twenty minutes later, I was not sure what I watched....I know only that it was NOT Mayle's \\"Good Year.\\"<br /><br />Oh, yes...the title was the same, the setting was the same and the main character, Max Skinner, had the same name.  But that was where any similarities between Mayle's original and Marc Klein's screenplay largely ended.<br /><br />In Mayle's original, Max finds himself improbably cheated out of his livelihood at lunch, and inheriting an estate by dinner time.  His career for the moment shot, Max has nothing to keep him from the splendors and adventures waiting in France.  The Klein screenplay, by contrast, has Skinner at the top of his professional form, albeit under a small but worrisome cloud: France, the estate and the circumstances of his inheritance are a bother, and this Skinner fully intends to make short work of them.  What follows is a standard boy-meets-girl tale, told against a larger story of self discovery.  Klein begins where Mayle began, and ends up in roughly the same place...but the path he takes to that end point is vastly and significantly different that the one taken by Mayle.<br /><br />The concept of screenplay and source material differing, even differing greatly, is certainly nothing new.  The problem here, however, is that Klein added nothing appreciably better.  Where the tension in Mayle's original came from a half-baked mystery he attempted to establish (before apparently losing interest and simply wrapping the whole thing up), the tension in Klein's version comes from Max's flashbacks to the time he spent under the tutelage of his dear, departed Uncle Henry....visions which call into stark contrast the man his uncle intended for him to become, and the man he in fact became.  Unfortunately choosing spend time recreating odd bits of Mayle's original storyline, Klein never gets the chance to fully develop the thread of Max's catharsis.  The change of heart he undergoes apparently comes as easily as everything else in his uniquely charmed life.<br /><br />The mediocre screenplay aside, the acting is generally first rate.  Russell Crowe has a romp playing a character who, had he been filmed fifty years earlier, would have almost certainly been played by Cary Grant.  Albert Finney has a similarly grand time playing the dear departed Uncle Henry, irascible, sly and all-knowing.  Unfortunately, Marion Cotillard, cast as Max's love interest, and Didier Bourdon, and Isabelle Candelier, the estate's husband and wife caretakers, get far too little screen time given the performances they turn in.  Among the few annoying cast notes is Freddie Highmore, as the young Max of the flashbacks, once again cast as one of those wise-beyond-his-years screen kids no one has ever actually met in real life.<br /><br />In the end, this film is no worse than the flawed book upon which it is loosely based, and may actually be a bit better.  Both are meaningless confections; but, as opposed to the book, the film takes only two hours to digest.isions which call into stark contrast the man his uncle intended for him to become, and the man he in fact became.

B00008RV1L|1.0|Mary Harron butchered one of my favorite books in the world. A literary giant. A book that defies so many conventional styles of writing, and set the pace for so many other budding artist to open their minds eye up to paper and spill all. I was horrified beyond explanation, and after initiallly viewing the film, which I waited two years plus to see because of fear of said deplorability, I sent her agent a letter detailing in 'no uncertian terms' how I felt about her talents, or lackthereof.<br /><br />Let me begin, and I am hoping you reader, you avid movie afficioando, will have an open eye to my view and not shoot me down with a check in the unhelpful column.  Remember this is just one movie lovers review, but it is *mine* nonetheless. Just one person's opinion on the transformation or migration, if you will from print to 35, just like one would certainly not go see a film based on what Gene Siskel or Shalit would say, or even A.O.  Scott (Heavens to Betsy), would say. We see the films we love or despise in our own unique ways.<br /><br />So with that said, if you read the book, and instantly, no immediately, no almost compulsively read it in one sitting, and then read it again, and again and again, and shared it with others who gave you strange  looks, or read it on the metro in Montreal or the filthy NR train to do your own bloodstained shirts downtown in NYC, and then realized that you have this work of pure metaphysical art next to your bedstand, and you stick it routinely in a napsack or the like, and for some reason or another you have 'YET' to rent or buy this DVD: \\"DONT.\\" I strongly encourage you, from one Ellis lover to another, hold off. Your Pat Bateman and the like, the characters you know and love and cherish and adore,  the scenes you have built up and played out in your minds eye time and time again, the pages that you have highlighted and doggy eared, the paragraphs which you have transformed over to myspace in perhaps your 'About Me' section, and the underlining on endless tabs of dazzling, dancing prose, that make Psycho what it was, will be sledgehammered, and you will wonder why it happened, who let it happen, and perhaps, like I was, be angry you saw it.<br /><br />Now I don't know what Ellis thought about Ms. Haron's version of this or even worse transforming of prose to film, the focal point of this reviewer, however the blame should lie ENTIRELY with her, not only from a directors standpoint, but from the dual roll as well as writer. Just like the most important part of reading a book in English from another language is obviously the translation, (Hamsun's 'Hunger' comes to mind, the others don't touch his translation) such should be that of the dual role of Ms.Harron.<br /><br />Now everyone has their own interpretation of Ellis' masterpiece, some take the novel very seriously, and compare it to some of the finest novels of our time, others, like Norman Mailer for instance, compare his writing style to that of Dostoyevski, and the reader can think it's a farce from the getgo with the satirical portrayal of Manhattan in the 80's and the stink, stank, stunk of the city that everyone knows 'how filthy it really is'. Yes, often times you wonder if in fact this murdering lifestyle Ellis' main character Pat Bateman delves into, is simply a figment of a warped mind, a sociopathic troubled yuppy, who would like to at times lash out at the world, and slice the throats of not only pathetic street urchins and flaming homosexuals, but also friends, coworkers and family alike.<br /><br />However, I took the book a bit more seriously. Ellis' amazing eye to detail in the murder scenes, and the exceptional tools he uses to craft out his work, is sheer brilliance. Ellis practically hands down nails 80's socialities in Manhattan. He nails their bravado, their ostentatiousness, their melancholy, ignorance of the downtrodden 'others' and his overt drug usage in the novel, placated with his having to look immacaulate with people that he surrounds himself with, who in turn have to look immaculate, is DEAD ON, and they did try hard to make that portrial come through in the film. The pretentiousness and thinking they have a better pot to piss in exist even moreso today (look at the pathetic Lindsey Lohan's, Paris Hilton's and Nicole Richie's of the world).<br /><br />The movie was portrayed too much as a farce. The dining scenes and dialouge are so brilliantly executed in the novel and sadly Ms. Harris misses almost every fine turn and trick in those conversations, including, but certainly not limited to the multiple 'Bellini' Orders that keep coming to the table, the red snapper scene which carries over to multiple chapters, trying to secure tables at A List restaurants last minute, Bateman's inner turmoil. I mean you kind of see it, (the business card scene comes to mind, which was not done that badly, for in that scene in itself we so how something as truly insignificant as raised brail on a card, can be so utterly important and top priority in these mens lives), yet it's not tangible to this viewer. I want to see Bateman cringing and screaming inside, and rarely do we see that in the film. The secretaries roll of Jean (played lacklustery by Chloë Sevigny), was third rate Ishtarian. Jean is a very important role, and at times I find, at least in the book, that Pat's feelings for Jean he stating he may eventually marry her, are quite genuine.<br /><br />There is one scene in the book where Bateman and I think that goof Van Patten and Craig McDermott, who is tres hip, are in the Yale Club and the flamboyant Carruthers is sitting a few tables away, and he (Bateman) is talking about what it would be like if Luis was eradicated. Would Courtney like him less if Luis was gone, what would it be like, and in his charade about killing Luis he talk about the war in Namibia with the Soviets, and through all this he ends with thinking about hacking Luis to death. There is nothing really humorous about that, disturbing and certainly sadistic, and that is exactly what Bateman is thinking. In the Yale Club at that exact moment he would love to just cold out murder Luis and watch his blood drain from his body, that in all surreal innuendo, is freakin brilliant.<br /><br />To think how many of us, (it's ok I will say it), want to just dump a body in a river sometimes, because of some of the assanine, trite people we share the earth with. It's human emotion, hate is an emotion.<br /><br />Those types of emotions garnered by Ellis and this reader did not come through in the film. It was rushed, lacked depth and character development. The exchanges between the detective, played suprisingly unbrilliantly by William Dafoe were adolescent; and the social scenes, although they were immaculately dead on with the clothes and the spit-spot looks and demeanors of the characters, the cohesion was flat and uninspiring.<br /><br />Then they went and defiled Ellis again by making American Psycho 2.<br /><br />In contrast, and to close, Christian Bale is a brilliant actor, his role as young Jim in Spielberg's \\"Empire of the Sun\\" is one of the most brilliant performances in cinema, and he did a fine job playing often emotionless and dead on 'mentally deranged' Pat Bateman. If they had a different director let's, say \\"Brian De Palma,\\" and a brilliant screenwriter (Ted Tally comes to mind), with a more interesting ensemble cast, this could have been a masterpiece.who in turn have to look immaculate, is DEAD ON, and they did try hard to make that portrial come through in the film.

B000OCXF0Q|1.0|man, i am so bummed that i wasted my time and money on this cd! i love avril's first two records, but this one is not worth anyone's time. i don't know what happened, but she took a step in the wrong direction. the tracks have no melodies to speak of, and little use of actual instruments. with the exception of \\"keep holding on,\\" i wouldn't bother. i love you, avril, but i hope you get back to what you do best, and leave the bells and whistles to performers like gwen stefani.

B00003CX5P|3.0|The more overhyped, overrated movies like The Departed, Brokeback Mountain & Blood Diamond that I run across, the more respect I have for Lucas & these movies.  Yes - even Episodes I & II.  At its worst, Star Wars makes more sense, is more entertaining & has more heart & soul than the so-called `masterpieces'.   <br /> <br />Sure, I have some quarrals with TPM: the pace could've used a bit of a jump start, following a structure like ANH had, and the Gungans seemed out of place in the SW Universe (though there were things I liked about them).  And yeah, Jar Jar got on my nerves a little in places (mostly at the beginning) but his antics were funny in several others.  I thought Anakin's beginnings made sense, though I think he should've been a little older & I loved the fact that he built 3PO.  I loved the planet of Naboo & there is just something cool about the droid armies. <br /> <br />I was a little disappointed by the space battle & thought Lucas made a big mistake by killing off Darth Maul.  I understand his reasoning but as much as I love Count Dooku & Lee's performance, Maul should've been the `Vader' of the prequals.  I've gone through periods where I've loved TPM & periods where I've hated it.  Now I've accepted it as the first part of the best movie saga ever made.  Other directors should be so lucky.
1594489505|4.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns is an emotionally powerful window into a society that is seldom opened to American readers.  Though I was not as totally captivated by Hosseini's second novel as I was by The Kite Runner, this novel was nonetheless compelling in its own right.  Again, Hosseini proves himself as an accomplished writer as he continues to discourse on friendship, suffering, traditions, and life in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Hosseini proves himself to be a fine surgeon, cutting away the fat to reach the very heart of the issues faced by the people (especially the women) of Afghanistan during several different government regimes.  And, like all surgery, this one will leave a scar on the heart of the reader.  This is a scar that is not meant to heal, but to educate and remind us of evil campaigns wrought by governmental powers that resonate with malevolence.<br /><br />This is a profoundly disturbing book.  It is a compelling story of friendship and sacrifice, grief and struggle and gives the Western reader a rare opportunity to peer into a way of life thrust upon Afghan women by the Taliban and other extremists who have wrested power in this part of the world.  One can almost taste the evil nature and feel the inhumane treatment meted out at the hands of these repressive governments.<br /><br />The main characters Mariam and Laila are sympathetically drawn, rich in development, likeable, and believable with flaws of their own. And, each will experience an inescapable life of endurance and suffering but also a life of hope and friendship.  And, it is this hope and friendship that will sustain them through unimaginable brutality inflicted upon them by their own husband and sanctioned by their own government.  It is hard to imagine living under these kinds of conditions and it's a strong reminder of our need to be vigilant and thankful for what we have in our country.<br /><br />The character of Rasheed garners the reader's wrath, distrust, and disbelief, as he continually mistreats his wives. He appears to take great pleasure in his role as sadistic master.  For me, Rasheed was the symbol for all the disgusting and vile actions of the various forms of government that literally destroy countries and citizens.  It should be clear that this type of power is corruptible, destructive and without redemption.<br /><br />Though at once a heartbreaking story of mental, physical and emotional abuse spanning 3 decades, this is foremost a novel of inspiration and determination.  It is a deeply moving account of life that speaks of a gut wrenching time in history and place when women were stripped of their humanity yet manage to shine forth with the indestructible hope created by love and friendship.  Contemporary and powerful, a novel well worth the read.  I look forward to many more fine novels by Hosseini.He appears to take great pleasure in his role as sadistic master.

B000053VAF|3.0|Dogma is not a bad movie, but it's not a good one.  It began with some sharp satire, got preachy in the middle (all the arrogant religions only see a little bit of the truth but the humble and wise Kevin Smith sees the whole picture - the standard elephant and the blind men fallacy) and ended like most of Smith's efforts...unevenly.  If Kevin Smith was a chess player he would have one of the world's best opening games, a slightly below average middle game and a horrid end game.  Oh, and if you are going to make a religious satire, please don't include 3 extended diatribes expounding `correct' pluralistic religious perspective.  Satire should preach subversively not didactically.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|The premise of the history of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), from a college frat-like tough boy club, where pig-pen mud wrestling and macho truth or dare sessions, (\\"Tell us something about yourself you've never told anyone\\"), were the order of the day, through to a troubled and scrutinized CIA in the early 1960's and the Cuban Bay of Pigs missile crisis, makes, as backdrop, a much more intriguing story than THE GOOD SHEPHERD's main focus - an upstart recruit's success and conflict, during the founding years of the organization, as he tries to live by his belief to know who you can trust. He soon finds he can trust no one but himself, but before we are accustomed to Matt Damon's bookish characterization of a serious minded government agent, (he's described as a tight-\\"behind\\" with no sense of humor), we can't help but wonder why he was so aggresively sought out by the CIA as a junior member. He's first seen, in drag, make-up, wig and falsetto voice, on a college theatrical stage singing in a Gilbert and Sullivan opera. He is, (gulp) a poetry student, and his father committed suicide with the distinction of being a traitor to the U.S. government. These should not be high marks on a CIA score card. But without further explanation he's sought after as if he's the ideal candidate. The rest of the film is a series of knee-deep espionage, and double agent revelations that apparently astounded the filmmakers, (musical score soars), but which could be found as passive page-turners in a mediocre paperback spy novel, (watch out for the brunette with the 'hearing aid' and eastern European accent who asks you over for dinner; wink, wink, nudge, nudge). The film goes on for three hours and is missing a narrative drive despite some dramatic pitstops along the way; Angelina Jolie is quite effective as Damon's socialite wife, and the Bay of Pigs segment seems an accurate portrait of the blundering by the U.S. government, but THE GOOD SHEPHERD mostly shepherds along as if searching a landmark statement it never reveals.arching a landmark statement it never reveals.

B000OCXMAE|5.0|For years I have felt guilty about enjoying Linkin Park, mainly because the   band has always been an over-the-top, cliched caricature of heavy music. I always felt embarrassed knowing that the very same tightly knit and interesting music I enjoyed was at any moment being played at top volume by some spoiled, suburban kid who just got grounded by his parents, and knows for sure that no one understands him.  <br /> <br />Linkin Park was to rock music what a good comic book is to literature...that is until Minutes to Midnight came out. This album breaks out of the well fortified box that the group solidified with Meteora. They cut loose and relax, no longer compelled to prove themselves as the rockingest-band-ever. And ironically, what hard parts this album does contain seem to soar beyond any track on previous discs. Perhaps because we're not over-saturated with fury this time around. Instead, both Chester Bennington, and Mike Shinoda (In Between) take their singing voices out for a spin, with terrific results.  <br /> <br />This album was written for a much more expansive audience than Linkin Park's current fanbase. Their maturity is showing through by now, but in a way it's also like the akwardness of adolescence. A great departure from all previous work, Minutes to Midnight will probably take awhile to establish it's identity.  <br /> <br />People either love or hate Linkin Park. Some former lovers will grow cold, for sure. But at the same time, some former haters will find a lot to love in this release, if they just give it a listen. The greatest obstacle for this band to overcome is the reputation they have already established.  <br /> <br />I, for one, am finally proud to say that I'm a fan.
B000P2A256|1.0|I would give it a NEGATIVE 5 Stars if I could.   Terrible and makes me want to take a nap.   What is up with this album???   They are trying way to hard and it doesn't work.   This album is Trite at best. This album shouldn't have been made.   I mean come on guys you wait 5 years, and this is all we get.  I expected something different and good, not the same. (Plus did you see Adam Levine on American Idol, his performance was worse than ANY of the contestants.  His voice was horrible.)   Don't waste you time on this album.

0802130208|2.0|I came across this book amidst many recommendations on how laugh-out-loud funny it is, and have always been bowled over whenever I've reasd a Pulitzer Prize winner.  I really wanted it to be funny, and I could see these ridiculous scenarios building up to their humorous climax in anticipation, but they quite simply weren't funny. I get what the author was going for - this absurd, delusional, quixotic train-wreck of a slob in Ignatius.  It was a clever book at points (especially Ignatius' writings).  I did laugh to myself a couple times, but most of the time, the humor missed the mark for me, and when something tries to be funny and fails over and over it just gets tired.   <br /> <br />I kept waiting for this to get funny all the way until the end of the book, it just didn't happen.  Not a bad book per se, but given the accolades it's received, and the fact that it's a Pulitzer Prize winner, I'm very dissappointed.  This is the first time I've ever read a Pulitzer winner and not been really impressed.

Besides being very dreary and depressing, it quickly deteriorated into another trite chasing and shooting guns movie. I'm so tired of movies with ridiculously unrealistic gun shooting.  There was also very little story and character detail, you have to know what the story is about ahead of watching it.
0618135871|5.0|David Kepesh, the narrator of THE DYING ANIMAL, leaves his wife and young son for a life of \\"emancipated manhood.\\" Then, for more than 30 years, Kepesh, a public intellectual, has complete freedom in his sex life, moving from woman to woman without commitment--albeit sometimes showing avuncular concern. Here's how alter-ego George O'Hearn and Kepesh advocate for this freedom.<br /><br />George: \\"People think that in falling in love they make themselves whole? The Platonic union of souls? I think otherwise. I think you're whole before you begin. And love fractures you.\\"<br /><br />David: \\"He who forms a tie is lost. Attachment is my enemy.\\"<br /><br />In THE DYING ANIMAL, Roth explores what happens to Kepesh after he loses his detachment and, in an intensely physical but still distant fashion, becomes emotionally involved with a beautiful young woman. Eventually, he must choose between survival and detachment or the consequences of responsible love.<br /><br />This is a fast-moving and fascinating novella.

0743455967|5.0|Stephen King's main point throughout this quick and entertaining read on the craft of writing is that authors must be honest or the work will not be compelling. And he follows his own advice -- or at least he seems to since the book confesses some pretty raw information.  The writing tips portion of the book reminds me of a recipe for meat loaf: it is utilitarian and designed for the 99 percent of us who just aspire to serve up a good story without botching it.  It's not for the final 1% who have the potential to write soaring prose like Steinbeck or Updike, but then those folks don't need writing manuals anyway.  Note to Mr. King: thank you for saving me the embarrassment of committing the first 100 mistakes you mention in your book!
B000002L61|4.0|Dio's debut album, \\"Holy Diver\\" was a metal classic, so Dio and company decided to do the same thing again. . .plus a few changes and compromises presumably intended to gain more airplay.  Now, there really isn't anything wrong with this in theory, especially since metal like this was mainstream at the time anyway, but, in practice, these changes weakened the sound a fair bit.  The biggest hit, by far, comes in the production.  The guitars are weak and distant and just totally wussed out.  Now, \\"Holy Diver\\" wasn't exactly the most bone-crushingly heavy album you're ever gonna here, and it was more about the energy and catchiness than the intensity.  Nevertheless, this is metal, and you need some crunch, and \\"The Last in Line\\" just doesn't have enough.  Beyond this, they've also increased the number of synths they used.  I've no strict ban against synths in metal, but they need be used sparingly and well, which doesn't always happen here.  They're not a huge problem, but a few tracks are weakened by poor synth work.<br /><br />More significant than the minor changes in the sound, however, is the drop off in the quality of the songwriting.  Most of the songs here are quite good, a few very good, but it's got nowhere near the consistency of \\"Holy Diver\\".  Like that album, \\"The Last in Line\\" opens with a speed metal opener followed by the more mid-paced title track.  Both are solid, if not totally remarkable.  (\\"I Speed At Night\\" would've been a better opener, as it's another speed-metal number, but just better than \\"We Rock\\")  \\"Breathless\\" is the first real standout, a good, driving mid-paced track with one of those unforgettable Dio choruses.  \\"One Night in the City\\" is even better, and probably the best track here.  It's one of the most overtly commerical tracks here, a quaso-ballad story song, but it's still the strongest track, with Dio's most intense, operatic vocals on the album.<br /><br />The second half isn't as solid as the first, though it too has no obvious filler.  (Though \\"Mystery\\" come close.)  \\"Egypt (The Chains Are On)\\" is probably the strongest track here.  Honestly, there should probably be more going on in it, as it's meant to be an epic, but it never gets dull, and Dio's overwhelming vocals carry the day once again.  The lyrics are a bit silly, but that's part of the fun.  \\"Evil Eyes\\" is probably the next best late track, and is fairly comparable to \\"Breathless\\", if not quite as good, though it suffers from some unneeded synth work.<br /><br />I'm coming across as more critical of \\"The Last in Line\\" than I actually feel.  It's a solid metal album through and through.  Still, comparisons to \\"Holy Diver\\" are inevitable, and \\"The Last in Line\\" is bound to come up short when looked at this way.  Still, it's more than worthwhile in its own right.ious filler.  (Though \\"Mystery\\" come close.)  \\"Egypt (The Chains Are On)\\" is probably the strongest track here.

B000P2A256|4.0|I must say, this album has really grown on me. Some real gems can be found here. There are the typical filler songs (which is part of what bumped it down to 4 stars instead of 5), but there is also something worthwhile to be gleaned from this album as a whole. <br /> <br />The strange part is that despite the fact that actually analyzing the quality of these songs leads me to believe the first album is better, I keep going back to this new one anyway! There's a certain quality here that I don't think is inherent in Songs About Jane - and I think it is this: It Won't Be Soon Before Long has a more mature, up-to-date feel that can't be found in Maroon 5's earlier works. By \\"mature\\" I don't mean it has any less energy. It's full of energy. But this is smoother - it's not just raw emotion anymore; it's emotion with meaning behind it. <br /> <br />My favorites are: Won't Go Home Without You, Makes Me Wonder, Kiwi, Can't Stop. <br /> <br />1. If I Never See Your Face Again - 8/10: Funky! I love the instrumentation in this one.  <br />2. Makes Me Wonder - 10/10: Here's their new single, and it's definitely very catchy. <br />3. Little of Your Time - 7.5/10: The chorus here is kind of bleh, but it does have a certain energy in it that makes it fun. <br />4. Wake Up Call - 8/10: I HATED this song at first, because the lyrics just seemed so outrageously dumb. After a few listens, though, I've realized that it all depends on how you look at it. The lyrics can be dumb... or they can be funny. I choose the latter. <br />5. Won't Go Home Without You - 10/10: This is catchy, simple, and sweet. It's the type of song you just have to sing along with. One of my favorites on the album. <br />6. Nothing Lasts Forever - 7/10: A little boring, but nice to listen to. <br />7. Can't Stop - 9.5/10: Hyped up and full of energy - I just wish it were longer. They should have stretched it into a full song. <br />8. Goodnight Goodnight - 8/10: Adam Levine's voice works great with this type of bittersweet, ballad-y song. <br />9. Not Falling Apart - 7/10: Not the best here, but it captures the type of music that can be found on this album: upbeat, energetic, and frank. <br />10. Kiwi - 9/10: This is a sort of funky, rocky song. I actually like the bridge better than the chorus. <br />11. Better That We Break - 7/10: This one is just okay. <br />12. Back At Your Door - 8/10: A good, determined way to end the album.

B000683VI4|4.0|`The Notebook' is a sweet romance with a compelling story.  The appeal easily develops with freewheeling dating scenes and revelations which unfold lovers sorting out priorities that hit so close to home.  A  bitter-sweet romance, the film is a beautiful tale of two sweethearts who come from completely different backgrounds but live in the same Southern town during the early forties.      Noah (Ryan Gosling) is from a dirt poor family and works as a logger for forty cents an hour.  Allie (Rachel McAdams) belongs to the Southern aristocracy.  She has private tutors for every class and most of her whims satisfied.  It is love at first sight for Noah who spots Allie at a carnival and jumps between her and her chosen date from the platform of a Ferris wheel.  Once he has her attention, he threatens to let go and fall to the pavement if she won't agree to date him.  From there his colorful presence challenges every route she's ever known.  They each bring a measure of deep beauty to each other:  He recites poetry, and she creates paintings.   All the oddball adventure he presents from lying down in the middle of a street to dare the traffic, letting go in a torrential rainstorm, to dancing in the street provide those defining moments that demonstrate how strangely people act when they are in love.  As the summer ends their lives are disrupted:  She is forced to go to Sarah Lawrence College in New York, and soon later he is drafted to fight in Europe during World War II.   They split ways and find different lovers, but their relationship is truncated, especially when Allie's manipulative mother (Joan Allen) intercepts Noah's letters that are meant for her.       `The Notebook' is told  from the point-of-view of \\"Duke\\" (James Garner) who reads the story of Noah and Allie to a beloved nursing home resident (Gena Rowlands) suffering from dementia.  I kept thinking as they sit on a park bench in one scene that the story is retold in a manner not entirely different from 'Forrest Gump'.  Duke narrates the story, and we come back to him and the woman until the two stories meet and have meaning.        Besides solid, absorbing performances by Gosling and McAdams, Garner softens the edge of the story as narrator, and Allen and Rowlands are easily captivating as Allie's complex and emotional mother and the elderly dementia patient.  'The Notebook' is a pleasing old-fashioned movie that easily plays on our heartstrings and provides a very satisfying viewing experience.  (Based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks)

B000NQR7KC|3.0|I first listened to these new remasters in the car late one night coming home on a long drive. On this release in particular, I noticed that everything, especially the drums, seemed either re-mixed, or just mastered so hot that it was overdriven sounding. Something didn't sound right....it wasn't as clean, and the separation seemed lacking. I'm no audiophile, I'm a drummer and long time musician/music lover, but I don't have the $10,000 system at home. I knew something sounded not the same with these re-masters. Sure enough, I got home and A/B'd it with the 1994 re-masters, and the difference was obvious. The older remasters actually sound cleaner to me, the drums sound undistorted and natural....unlike the new version, which almost sounds like it was re MIXED, not just remastered. Granted, I love the louder volume in most remasters, but this isn't just louder, it sounds like the original recording was tinkered with. Maybe I'm imagining things, but I don't think so. Needless to say, I've kept the old versions to listen to, and am keeping the new ones for the great DVD content. Bummer. I don't even have surround sound to check out the 5.1 mixes.

It's good to start with volume one because you learn about Mma Ramotswe's father and how she came to set up her agency.

Botswana, like places everywhere has worried parents, suspicious spouses, and employers who sometimes need a detective.

But in the middle of class and humerous snobbery, there is a man who is on a quest for cosmic clarity and union with the infinite. His journey is so different than the people he associates with, that the novel becomes a story of contrasts. That is one of the enjoyable aspects of this novel. It is also rich in description, which allows us to be included in that time and that place.
0743270754|5.0|First and foremost, Team of Rivals is not a perfect book.  Goodwin seems to almost worship Lincoln, excusing and explaining away his faults while lauding his strengths.  However, the title of the book, Team of Rivals, indicates that this is not purely a biographical work about Lincoln.  It is about his cabinet and the inner workings of a group of men, each of who were brilliant and strong willed.  It is about Lincoln's courage in calling these men together, in spite of their divergent beliefs.  It is about Lincoln's ability to reconcile these men and work for positive change during one of the most trying periods in America's history.  On these levels, Team of Rivals succeeds admirably.\ <br /> <br />Team of Rivals also covers the history of a period that shaped the world and resulted in a nation that was changed forever, becoming a world power for over 100 years after the Civil War.  Goodwin brings this history to life in engaging and accessible prose.  To one who is not a Lincoln scholar, her approach was refreshing and opened my eyes to the inner workings of government in a time that was so very different from ours today. <br />

0439813786|5.0|<br />You know that feeling when you're sitting in a movie theater and the lights dim? The audience hushes, the curtain opens, the music starts to play, and suddenly you feel as if anything can happen, as if your very dreams could be projected up there on the screen.  <br /> <br />OK, on the other hand, maybe you don't know --- or remember --- that feeling at all. In this age of megaplexes, stadium seating, DVDs and home theater systems, it's hard to imagine a time when going to the movies was truly a magical experience. In his fascinating new novel, THE INVENTION OF HUGO CABRET, Brian Selznick brilliantly recaptures this feeling and repackages it for a new generation.  <br /> <br />Selznick's reputation up until now has been primarily as an illustrator, so it's no coincidence that nearly half the novel's pages consist of wonderfully detailed line drawings. What's remarkable about the way Selznick uses illustrations, though, is that the pictures --- often as much as the text --- help to tell the story, to set a scene, even to develop characters.  <br /> <br />Take the novel's opening pages, for example. On the first two-page spread, we see a full moon peeking out of a small white box in the middle of a sea of black. On the next page, the box opens up to reveal more of the sky. Likewise, in the third and fourth pages, the black border (like movie theater curtains) retracts to reveal the Paris skyline. Subsequent pages focus on the Paris train station, and finally settle in on one particular boy in the teeming, bustling crowd inside.  <br /> <br />That boy is Hugo Cabret, whom we proceed to meet in the text that follows. Hugo is a lonely boy, an orphan who has been charged with maintaining the many clocks in the train station. Hugo secretly lives in the station, too, stealing what he needs to get by. This includes not only food, but also small mechanical toys from the grouchy old gentleman who runs a toy shop in the station. Hugo needs the parts to help him repair the clocks --- and to try to fix his greatest secret and most prized possession.  <br /> <br />It's an automaton, an incredibly intricate mechanical man. Hugo's father found the machine and spent years trying to fix it. After his father's death, Hugo is determined to fix the automaton. After all, the automaton's mechanism should allow it to write --- maybe even to pass on a message from Hugo's dead father. If only he could find a way to make it work!  <br /> <br />Soon enough, though, Hugo's thefts get him in big trouble with the toy shop owner. Hugo's new connection to the man and his busybody goddaughter seems to threaten the future of the automaton as well as Hugo's own well-guarded secrets. Or could it be that these new acquaintances are just what Hugo needs after all?  <br /> <br />Inspired by real historical characters and films, Selznick's novel is a real breakthrough in storytelling technique. By using illustrations --- including not only his intricate drawings but also film stills and other archival photos --- to further the plot, establish setting and even develop his characters, Selznick's spare prose seems to gain gravity and importance as well. Readers will pore over not only the illustrations, but also the words, which are rarely wasted and often contain real wisdom.  <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl <br />

0385335997|5.0|Outlander will always be my favorite in this series but Voyager runs a close race. What can I say about Jamie and Claire that hasn't already been said. The most realistic charactors that you will ever have the pleasure to meet in a story. As much as I loved Dragonfly in Amber, there were parts in the beginning that were a little slow but Voyager starts with a bang and never stops until you finish the last page. Another incredible triumph in one of the greatest epic adventures ever written.
0743289412|2.0|I'm going to keep this short and sweet.  Stephen King is one of the greatest storytellers of his time.  If you're expecting a real Stephen King masterpiece like Pet Semetary, IT, or The Shining, then this is not it for you.  The writing is beautiful and very original.  He's creative.  But, the story is boring and, in my opinion, a chore to get through.  As I said, this was piece of originality and probably a creative endeavour for him, but he's better writing the scary stuff than this boring manuscript of 500 pages.
0385335989|4.0|Let me first say the Outlander Series is the best collection of books I've ever read. However Drums of Autumn was not my favorite of the series. After reading Voyager that was non-stop action and romance, DOA slowed down quite a bit and focused more on the relationship between Claire and Jamie's daughter Brianna and her relationship with Roger McKenzie. Unfortunately I couldn't seem to ever care for these two as much as I had Jamie and Claire. Of course the book still had breathtaking and suspenseful moments and Diana Gabaldon is a master storyteller. The place and time of this book had special interest to me because my ancestors immigrated from Scotland and Ireland along this time period and came to GA through the NC mountains. It was interesting to learn how many southern customs and traditions came to be. Even though not as good as the first three, still a wonderful book and a must read to continue the series.
B000002UWF|5.0|This disk rocks, and is packed with great, upbeat music. It brims with humor and spirit. Even though it runs for well over an hour, I feel let down when it's over.<br /><br />Unlike many of the people who have posted here before me, I have no particular interest in the swing revival, and I did not come across Louis Prima via Brian Setzer. Brian Setzer is, however, as good a link to Louis Prima as any. Prima was a mysterious figure who played heavily in the otherwise fictional 50's period Italian food film \\"Big Night\\" (1996). Intrigued, I bought this disk after seeing \\"Big Night\\" in the theatre.<br /><br />The song \\"Beep Beep\\" is dated and corny, but it differs from the rest of the disk only in its space-age subject matter and \\"otherworldly\\" slide-guitar sound effects. It was topical during the late-50's space race. Everything else holds up perfectly well over 40-plus years.<br /><br />Prima's band is tight, yet spontaneous and not sterile. He has a great onstage comic rapport with cohort Sam Butera, and also with his then-wife and straight-woman Keely Smith.<br /><br />An example from \\"Embraceable You\\" --<br /><br />Keely (singing): \\"Why don't you come and get your baby-do...\\"<br /><br />Louis (aside to the audience): \\"Call from 'The Point'.\\"<br /><br />This disk is a must for any non-classical music lover with a pulse. This is in my top 5 CD's, out of perhaps 400 I own, and is certainly a \\"desert island disk.\\" Deservedly, almost everyone on this page has given it 5 stars. It doesn't get any better than this, kids.  (Adapted from my review of 10/27/1999.)

B000H5U65C|5.0|Mastodon is the rarest kind of metal band -- a really brilliant, creative one. No posing or nu-metal appeals for radioplay here.<br /><br />And after their previous brilliant albums, they reached a new apex in \\"Blood Mountain.\\" The Atlanta band spins songs about a beautiful, icy land -- played in a sonic eruption of kinetic instruments and some brilliantly mythic lyrics. It's a fiery, breathtaking ride.<br /><br />It opens with rapid-fire drums and a squealing guitar, with a hoarse voice shouting, \\"The hero of the gods/The crossing of the threshold!\\" But the music soon uncoils into a fast-moving hard-rocker, full of blistering riffs and surreal lyrics about gods, shapeshifters, tyrants, heroes and \\"hulder folk and fairies.\\"<br /><br />Then we break into the tribal drums and blazing, sludgy riffs of \\"Crystal Skull,\\" which is just begging to be air-guitared. And they don't let up in the songs that follow: the darkly epic \\"Sleeping Giant,\\" metal with nimbly catchy melodies, sludgy hard-rock that blazes with muscular basslines, and expanses of roaring prog-metal that races by at light speed.<br /><br />No ballads. No interludes. Sure, some of these songs open with some electronic squiggling, or maybe a mellow guitar melody, but they don't take long to explode into something totally different. The only exception is \\"Pendelous Skin,\\" the very last song on the album -- it's an atmospheric blend of slow-burning rock played in a more alt-rocky style.<br /><br />But up until then, it's nothing but rapid-fire, headbanging proggy-rocky metal. Sludgy and/or muscular riffs, smashing bass, and blindingly rapid drums that have to be heard to be believed -- and the whole thing is tightly woven out of different styles. And this is all to make story-songs with complex, intense melodies that can change in midsong -- from epic metal to chaos, and back again -- to reflect whatever is happening.<br /><br />And the world Mastodon is exploring in this just reeks of fantasy and old legends -- nature gods, wilderness, icy lands, skulls, tree people, ivory towers, one-eyed monsters, more skulls, and ancient elms. I have no idea what they're trying to communicate, but their songwriting is definitely atmospheric (\\"A vast calm wilderness/The call to adventure comes/Lead and land atop this rock/Infinite path carved with unrivaled skill...\\")<br /><br />Mastodon's \\"Blood \\"Mountain\\" is a devastatingly, frighteningly mythic experience, like wandering through an ancient legend.

B000IN0ZLS|5.0|\\"Possession\\" is far above and beyond the kind of books usually labelled \\"romance.\\" It's lushly written, with exquisite characters, great poetry and interweavings of legend and myth. It's almost chastely erotic, mysterious and dripping over with Victorian-era romance. It's hard not to be drawn in.<br /><br />A young scholar, Roland, stumbles accidently on an old letter from acclaimed poet Randolph Ash. He soon has reason to believe that the letter was to Christabel La Monte, a lesser-known \\"fairy\\" poet -- except Ash was happily married, and La Monte was single all her life. Roland and the chilly fellow scholar Maud investigate caches of hidden letters, poems, and diaries by the lovers, wife, friends and relatives.<br /><br />In the past, the cordial letters of Christabel and Randolph blossomed into love and passion. They vanished for a short, blissful time together. But what happened to Christabel and Randolph's love, and why did Christabel leave England, while her companion Blanche committed suicide? And how do these events somehow involve Roland and Maude's own growing attachment?<br /><br />They say the pen is mightier than the sword, and in \\"Possession\\" it's a valuable historical tool. When words are hidden or read, it can change perceptions and even lives. Byatt's own words are wonderfully lush, dreamy and vivid. Given the rather formal language and writing, it almost seems like a nineteenth-century novel, as if Byatt got so swept up in the characters that she started writing like them.<br /><br />Byatt has an excellent eye for the language of the era. The letters, poetry and fiction of Christabel and Randolph have a very authentic feel. Especially since Byatt manages to change tones for different people's writing (Christabel's poetry was a bit reminiscent of Emily Dickenson's). The only problem is when the book veers into long tangents; Byatt seems to get a little off-track there. But most of the time, the richness of Breton legend adds depth and mystery to an already beautiful novel. The sunken city of Is, the legend of Melusina, and many others are here.<br /><br />Byatt gives us an amazing look at the ill-fated lovers, Christabel and Randolph; you can feel their passion and love. They aren't just attracted to each other, but drawn together in the mind and spirit. The supporting characters, such as the artist Blanche and devoted, wistful Ellen Ash, are equally well-drawn; you can't dislike any of them. Roland and Maud seem a little anemic by comparison, but they are still compelling characters, caught up in a love affair from over a hundred years ago.<br /><br />After taking the recommendation of a good friend, I found that \\"Possession\\" is the kind of genuine, heartwrenching romance that you don't see much of -- meetings of minds, genuine passion and love. It's a beautiful thing, and something to be deeply treasured.stery to an already beautiful novel.

0783114893|2.0|Hitcher takes a great story and turns it into an unbelievable, frustrating mess. Murphy's Law is definitely the premise of this movie. It becomes so frustrating watching everything go wrong.  The problem with the movie is one that is just so unbelievable.  I have this problem with a lot of movies but this one just takes it so far that it totally ruins it for me.  The killer manages to be everywhere with little explanation of how he got there.  Not only that, but he seems to be able to move and kill silently without anyone noticing until an opportune moment when he suddenly appears.  The only good thing about this movie is Rutger Hauer who plays his part perfectly. And it is occasionally suspenseful when you're not too busy laughing at it.

B00009ATKS|4.0|In a way this album exemplifies the musician's perennial problems of trying to square the circle by coming up with something different whilst staying the same. From the opening notes this is clearly identifiable as being Mogwai and as it progresses can be heard to equal the quality of its predecessors. The individuality of their musical identity creates unenviable inbuilt difficulties: if a piece resembles an earlier recording, the band is laid open to charges of stagnation, of simply having further stabs at basically recording the same album in a new guise; if it differs too much, they risk being accused of losing their identity, or even of selling out and becoming too commercial.<br /><br />Perhaps tellingly, the two songs that featured in the top ten of the 2003 John Peel Festive Fifty, the only two to be placed, were Hunted By A Freak and the eight-minute epic Ratts Of The Capital, as these side-openers contain the most recognisably Mogwai trademark qualities: the sinister, slow building of the soundscape, the quiet/loud/quiet passages, the tortured guitar. However, elsewhere on the record there are several subtle indications that Mogwai have plenty left to say, musically speaking, and there is more of a democratic band feel than in some of their earlier guitar-led pieces. Four of the tracks are augmented by cello or violin, and a string quartet is employed to atmospheric effect on Killing All The Flies.<br /><br />As always, the titles remain enigmatic and willfully ungrammatical (Boring Machines Disturbs Sleep; Moses? I Amn't), and in a mark of the new maturity and restraint shown throughout this extremely listenable record, most of the pieces are only three or four minutes long. This is not a record that gives away all its secrets on the first listen, but rewards repeated plays. This is in no small part due to the skilful engineering led by Tony Doogan at the CaVa studios in Glasgow, but also to the collaborative efforts and musical empathy of the band themselves.hemselves.

While Anna is fighting for medical emancipation from her parents grip on her and her sister, what is learned from the process is amazing. <br /> <br />The plot intensity builds as the narrative switches between characters in each chapter- a writing style I love and admire.  This book is well written and you really feel like you know each character and why they do what they do, even if you don't agree.  The family life as they try to accomodate this poor sick girl is a whirlwind of hospitals and needles and blood, and is an emotional ride, for sure. <br /> <br />This book has so much to be discussed, so many characters to unravel and pieces to put together- it would be an amazing book club or discussion book, but it was also a pleasure to just curl up with and enjoy on my own.

0151013047|5.0|There is no resolution in this book.  The aura of threat, a kind of squirmishness pervades the monologue of a Prinston-trained, bearded Pakistani who has selected an American to share a table with and confront with his personal history regarding the present strife between our cultures.

It is a reasonable place to be hanging, as a reader, between the desire to make amends and the fear for our lives.
B000O178BY|5.0|Trent Reznor's 2007 \\"Year Zero\\" may prove to be one of his strongest and most sonically accessible records yet. Complete with catchy guitar hooks, faintly disguised hip-hop beats laced with electronic beeps and white noise, and a concept album storyline featuring a plausible American futuristic nightmare, \\"Year Zero\\" holds its listener in fascinated and groove-driven captivity. <br /> <br />Expanding on themes that were briefly reflected in \\"With Teeth,\\" such as the ongoing Iraq War and the Bush Administration, \\"Year Zero\\" is by all means a departure for Reznor. Since Nine Inch Nails' debut in 1989, Reznor's music has always been viewed by fans and the music press alike as highly introspective, cryptic, and daresay even a little mysterious. Albums such as \\"Pretty Hate Machine,\\" \\"the Downward Spiral,\\" \\"the Fragile,\\" and the violent EP \\"Broken\\" lyrically and sonically read like quickly written diary entries, complete with fresh pen ink, eraser marks, and sometimes little fantasies that most of us would keep hidden. This highly personal and intense persona, driven through music influenced by everyone from Bowie, Talking Heads, to Skinny Puppy, gained Reznor an immense following in the alternative scene and beyond.  <br /> <br />Now clean and sober in the post-9/11 age, Reznor has matured considerably. Less inclined to open the diary for an album, Reznor has instead aimed NIN's lyrical and sonic broadside guns to the very real world outside our doors. With song titles that would fit perfectly into a Noam Chomsky dissertation (\\"Hyperpower,\\" \\"the Greater Good\\"), \\"Year Zero\\" is clearly political. <br /> <br />Beginning with the instrumental \\"Hyperpower,\\" a brief jingoistic guitar and drum assault that marches and cheers like an American \\"Triumph of the Will,\\" the tone of the rest of the album is set. As in usual Reznor fashion, one song metls seamlessly into the other. \\"The Beginning of the End\\" picks up where \\"Hyperpower\\" introduced us, while \\"Survivalism,\\" a jangly dark-pop driven tune, puts us in the mind of counter-revolutionaries in a futuristic U.S. swarmed by reactionary conservatism, foreign aggression, and terrorism.  <br /> <br />Other stand-outs include the industrial grind of \\"Vessel,\\" the trip-hop of \\"Me, I'm Not,\\" and the downright electrofunk of \\"Capital G,\\" one of the few songs this reviewer can think of that you can dance along to lyrics describing elections, greed, and air attacks on foreign lands watched comfortably at home on the TV set. Another sure stand out, \\"My Violent Heart,\\" sonically nods Public Enemy during their \\"Fear of a Black Planet\\" days.   <br /> <br />As the album progresses, the view of America (and indeed, the whole world) in the future progressively becomes dimmer and dimmer, when it seems that humans are even now beyond the control of their ultimate fate. Reznor's vision isn't too dissimilar from another recent dystopia; Alfonso Cuaron's \\"Children of Men.\\" In that movie, set in an infertile world beset by rampant terrorism and the loss of hope, its main characters strove on to their ultimate fates despite the confusion all around, always with the faint glimmer that hope could be on the horizon. <br /> <br />\\"Year Zero\\" also comes to the same conclusion. In the slow, blip-beep-beat driven \\"Zero Sum,\\" where the end of civilization seems nigh, Reznor whispers through the piano and distorted beats that he is not afraid.  <br /> <br />And neither should the listener be afraid of \\"Year Zero.\\" Instead of isolating and numbing the listener, Reznor instead invites us to sit down, to put on the earphones, turn on the BBC News website, think of our democracy and environment, and maybe, just by chance, bobb your head to the beats.

Collins makes it a point that great companies are not formed over night and in order to meet his stringent requirements only eleven companies can be classified as being truly \\"Great.\\"  A refreshing discovery Collins and his research team discovered was the characteristics of what they consider a \\"Level 5 Leader\\" that took their companies and out performed good companies such as Coca-Cola and General Electric. Collins states the level 5 executives are humble, modest, works for the company and not themselves. They point any blame onto themselves when things do not go right, but contributes success to good luck and their team.

I bought a copy for my 5 year old son (warning there is a bit of cursing but hey, I grew up with it so can he)  He loves it and watches it over and over again. Thankfully its one of those movies that I could never get sick of so I havent gone crazy from seeing it yet.
0743289412|3.0|Lisey's Story is the story about Lisey Landon, widow of famed and acclaimed Scott Landon.  While going through her husband's office two years after his passing, she begins to discover things that trigger memories that she has been suppressing.  The reader is taken on a journey that jumps through time and space, visiting the unforgettable Boo'ya Moon, a strange Otherworld, that people visit when they are unable to face life.<br /><br />While there were parts of this book that I thoroughly enjoyed, such as Scott Landon's use of the phrase \\"the pool where we all go down to drink\\" to describe a figurative and literal place similar to Jung's collective unconscious, I found myself more interested in the ideas set forth in the novel rather than the story or the characters themselves.  I found Lisey's internal monologues to be long-winded and grating on the nerves, and I found myself just not caring what happened about 3/4 of the way through the book.<br /><br />The sections of the book that took place in the Otherworld Boo'ya Moon left me unsatisfied, and I much rather enjoyed the stories that were rooted in reality, such as the story of Lisey brandishing a silver spade to save her husband.<br /><br />While King is one of my all-time favorites (and always will be), I have to admit that I just couldn't get into his latest effort.  I look forward to reading what he comes out with next.

A lot more than something like The World is Flat or Greenspan's Fraud, both which told me a lot of what I already know and were very into spinning their own stories.  <br /> <br />I read some background commentary on the Black Swan from the New Yorker (Gladwell) and at Daily Speculations that suggest there some issues with The Black Swan as well.  But I wasn't smart enough to fault the arguments in the book, and in fact I agree with most of them.  <br /> <br />Where I can see problems is if people expect to develop trading strategies looking for Black Swans. Black Swans can be White Swans to others. I think that goes without saying that not all people are surprised by the same things.  <br /> <br />Applying this book's conclusions to investing can be dangerous (ie, looking for a Black Swan that is a White Swan to someone else). I would rather learn from the book about the nature of risk as unevenly distributed than think I am going to make money looking for unevenly distributed risk (which is the implication from some discussions). <br /> <br />A couple of things I didn't like were the strong sense of being right and an 'us against them' mentality coming from some of the sections as well as the use of catchy terms (heuristic devices). Inventing terminology (Black Swan, Extremistan...) for a book should only be done sparingly. Black Swan is ok, but the other terms are not really needed. <br /> <br />I liked the chapter organization and a relatively tight read in covering a lot of ground on thinkers and events. But I was also expecting a few more discussions on markets.  <br /> <br />Having doubted the usefulness of CAPM and traditional usage of concepts on risk for most of my time as an analyst, I enjoyed the critique of Plato, Bell Curves and Merton. But since Taleb is good at communicating, I would have liked longer and more in-depth discussions on problems with the concepts rather than the people and the institutions who developed the concepts. <br />

B000KQGX1Y|5.0|A New Journey.  Honestly, I do not have the words to describe it.  Only that it is the most beautiful, inspirational, and powerful of all Irish music that I have heard thus far.  The voices of each girl are incredible, but when combine would bring the world to its knees and then make it rise and dance all over the world creating A New Journey for all of us.
B000002MUN|5.0|Wildflowers truly is a wonderful album.  The thing that makes the album so great is the fact that Tom Petty really gave each of the songs a personal message that just about ANY one can relate to.  Every song has a meaning that's worth listening closely to. <br /> <br />Whether it's the rockers or the ballads or just the pretty songs, there's something here for everyone.  Everybody knows Tom Petty is one of the most easily likeable musicians in the world of pop music, and this album further proves just how enjoyable his music is.  He's good at what he does, and he continues to show the world his style with overwhelmingly positive results just about every time.   <br /> <br />Kick back, turn the lights off, and just listen to a personal journey and probably the best album Tom Petty ever made.
0345440900|5.0|The \\"EASY\\" approach really helped me to better read my baby & interpret her needs. I felt more in control of what was going on with my baby & it helped in what to expect next. Soon I could plan things better because I knew what was going on with the baby and I actually felt like I knew what I was doing! It helped me relax and enjoy my baby instead of wondering if I was meeting her needs. I honestly don't know what I would've done without this book!

0743277457|5.0|I heard Josh interviewed on NPR recently. Before the show was completed I ordered his book; The Art of Learning. Having just finished my first reading, the pages are heavily highlighted and the margins are drenched in notes. This is a narrative too meaningful to miss, rich in the human experience. The application of his life experiences go beyond chess and martial arts. Josh's struggles and his victories may be on a different level than most but you will resonate with the humanity, as I did. <br />  I have worked in critical care nursing for many years and the intensity can at times be overwhelming. This leads many to burn-out and leave the profession. The insights Josh provides in this book should be an integral part of nursing education. Concepts such as investment in loss, using adversity, and making sandals, are tools I now employ in the workplace challenges I face. I know these ideas could help others whether you are a nurse committed to healing, a business person closing a deal, or a parent raising a child.  <br />  Healing is invoking the will to live in others--Josh has done that for me in this work.
B0007P0LPC|5.0|This Swan Lake is one of the best I have ever seen. Though the Nureyev staging is very different from the \\"typical\\" staging, his performance is unrivaled. He carries the Pas de Cinq in Act I and does an amazing job in the Black Swan Pas de Deux of Act III. Fonteyn is also very good, though she is admittedly past the peak of her career. For all Nureyev fans, this is his best commercially available performance.
0689861141|5.0|We have the board book edition of this, and even though our 'baby' is 5, we still read it often. I just can't figure out WHY people get rid of their 'board books' once their baby is past the toddler stage. These are little treasures. I think I'll probably keep all of ours and read 'em for myself to keep me young when I'm in the nursing home! -At least the grandkids will have something fun to look at when they visit.:)<br /><br />The rhyming and the illustrations in this book are great! You get to see the animals go through their nite time rituals of getting ready for bed. We enjoy reading this as well as our daughter. It's a short one and she's memorized it, so she reads it to her dolls sometimes.
158799190X|1.0|Slipshod thinking and appalling writing from a preening egoamaniac with a fat wallet. Of course, the great irony is that, for all Taleb's admonitions to beware survivor bias, this would never have been published if he himself had been unsuccessful in his trading.    The author confesses in the first few pages that he did no research specifically for the book, and relied entirely on memory -- and it shows whenever he writes about anything not autobiographical. Even then! Maybe this is a fictional memoir of a repulsive, unreliable narrator, a Nabokovian game? Taleb does claim to be a \\"connoisseur\\" of literature. The joke's on us, I think.

However, somehow, this law hides  from so, so many.  Revealing itself probably could be the most wonderful gift for humanity, but as other great principles, The Secret has gotten the grip of some good people to make us use our own thoughts as the more powerful tool to build us confident, honest, generous, successfuls, prosperous, victorious, auspicious.

1594489505|5.0|I wanted to read A Thousand Splendid Suns simply because I thought The Kite Runner was incredible.  Hosseini did not disappoint me.  Others have already given an overview of the story, so I'll skip that here.  <br />As an American, I admit that I know very little about the people and culture of Afghanistan.  I see war torn cities and covered women on the news and have no real understanding or sympathy for what is going on.  I am grateful to Hosseini for making me take a closer look.  Through his engrossing and disturbing story, he introduces us to women living through the turmoil of the fighting factions and the Taliban.  He enables us to have a better understanding of the culture of Afghanistan from the eyes of an insider.  I have a new sympathy for the Afghani women living through the unrest in that part of the world.  I feel a sense of kinship that I have not experienced before.  I thank Hosseini for broadening my awareness and providing an excellent story at the same time.  I eagerly await future books from this author.
0385340559|5.0|Jack Reacher has taken on some of the trappings of civilization.  He has a passport, and he has an ATM card.  He became tapped out when he took a woman out to dinner in Portland, Oregon.  When he accesses his account, he finds an odd amount of money has been deposited, i.e., $1,030.  He is a numbers guy.  10-30 was the radio code for \\"urgent assistance needed\\" when he was a major in the military police years previously.<br /><br />When he tracks down the source of the deposit, he finds one of his old associates, Frances Neagley, who wants him to put the old unit back together.  One of the members, there were originally nine, has been brutally murdered.  \\"You do not mess with the special investigators.\\"  Reacher sets out to find the people responsible.  It is first necessary to determine what the individual had been working on.  He had been in contact with the assistant director of security for an aerospace company developing a highly classified weapons system, also an old team member.  That man is now missing.<br /><br />The novel is partly mystery and partly procedural.  The \\"old team\\" had some special talents, and they are quite willing to exact their own form of justice.  Dead bodies are left for others to clean up, or conveniently buried.  Reacher picks up some working cash as \\"spoils of war.\\"  There are some surprises, and a question about who is better off, Reacher who is footloose with few material belongings (he changes clothes by buying new and throwing away the old), or his old associates who have tied themselves down.<br /><br />As expected, the villains are punished (let the punishment fit the crime), and Reacher goes his own way, although he becomes somewhat richer from captured spoils (Kipling wrote a poem about that).<br /><br />Who knows where Reacher might next end up.  It depends on where he gets off the bus.  It might even be in your town.  Look for a tall, heavy individual, probably walking, dressed down in somewhat scruffy clothes, and probably with a bad haircut.  Don't even think of messing with him.think of messing with him.
B000QQH4YS|5.0|I was nine years old when my Dad snuck my brother and I into this movie and it changed my life forever...Seeing Murphy's hand blow up all over the floor was so good at that age...A must have...! <br /> <br />\\"Go Robo!\\"
0743442539|4.0|This is an excellent, tightly told, spy thriller but let's get one thing out of the way - if you're expecting high tech gadgets, cover to cover action, and chisel-chinned heroes who know kung fu don't bother with this.  The main character, Alec Leamas, is a 50 year old guy who drinks too much and wears raincoats, the majority of this slim novel is simply characters talking and the climax takes place in an East German tribunal, not in some underwater fortress.  The Spy Who Came In from the Cold is a thinking persons thriller - intricately plotted and written, and will leave you guessing and second guessing everything that is going on.  I don't want to say anything about the plot other than Alec Leamas is assigned to act as a double agent in order to take out a high-ranking East German spy.  To say anything else would be criminal.  The book has it's flaws, notably the narration which is effective and readable but is often a bit too cold and clinical.  However, it is well worth reading if you're looking to read a classic spy thriller and if you've never read le Carre.  It might not be the best book ever written, but good on the editors of Time Magazine for including this in their All-Time Top 100 Novels.  Recommended.

B000HC2LIK|2.0|I heard the \\"suits\\" at Warner made Scott add the voice over because they thought the movie's plot was too vague without it, looks like they were right. But this movie has other weaknesses. First the FX which set the mood has lost much of its power to impress, granted that can't be helped, but its still a fact. The not so subtle Japan bashing, from a time when Japan was seen as our #1 threat, seems as corny today as a Red Scare movie from the `50s. Last the endless philosophizing by beings, that don't exist, and probably never will, on the subject of \\"are skin jobs human\\". Maybe expecting a movie to have the same impact 25 years later is unrealistic, or maybe it was based on once trendy now passé ideas.
B000MGUZM0|4.0|I ordered this for my 15 year old.  He thinks it's cool and it sounds even better really loud.  What doesn't? <br />I like it because they sound like a whole bunch of other people: Echo and the Bunnymen, Talking Heads (a little)and it has great arrangements incorporating unusual musical instruments and effects.  Haven't heard a huge church organ in a popular song ever?
B000J103WK|4.0|An excellent concert & to be enjoyed in HD is another plus.  The Eagles actually seem better in their old age now.  It must be maturity.  Although, the HD DVD did not have camera angle shots as an added bonus, it was still produced well & is an excellent item for the DVD library.
B000002H6C|5.0|I doubt that anyone here has not heard of Metallica.  And, there are probably many among you who feel this was Metallica's last great studio effort.  Whatever the case, it must also be remembered that this was the first album they did without the legendary bassist Cliff Burton and the lack of his music theory knowledge is clearly displayed on this album.  Don't get me wrong.  \\"...And Justice For All\\" is a spectacular album, but it will always be in the shadow of \\"Master of Puppets.\\"    Even so, there are some really good songs on Justice and not a one I don't like.    --------------------------------------------------------------------------    1. Blackened - \\"See your mother die!\\"  Yes, this is a great song.  Many consider this to be the best album opener that Metallica has ever done.  I am not here to argue, but there are strengths and weaknesses to this one.  The strengths include a tremendous intro, great technical play, a strong mid section, and indelible lyrics.  The weakness, which may be true of all the songs on Justice, is a thin guitar sound.  Perhaps this has to do with the perceived underproduced bass play.  Whatever is the case, this song would be infinitely greater with a deeper sound and I would consider it among the best songs in Metallica history, were that the case.    2. ...And Justice For All - Wow!  Did you get to sample the job they did with this one live on the Sick of the Studio tour?  With a proper bass play this song is as powerful and dynamic as \\"Master of Puppets.\\"  Tremendous lyrics, great theme musically.  If there is a complaint it is that the song might be too long, at nearly 10 minutes.    3. Eye of the Beholder - the consensus weak point of the album.  Nevertheless, it is a good song in it's own right.  The only problem is that much of what Metallica meant to say with this one could be gleaned from the previous song.  The music is powerful and tremendous, however.    4. One - from which Metallica's first video came.  It is the storyof the tragedy of a man who loses his senses on the battlefield.  This is a melodic yet powerful balad type song and is probably Metallica's second most famous song, behind \\"Enter Sandman.\\"  If you've never heard this song, then buy this album just for that experience alone.  Trust me, you won't regret buying this album, and you'll just love this song.    5. The Shortest Straw - The song of bad luck.  The power of the drums really kicks the song up a notch.  Without them this would be the album's weak point.    6. Harvester of Sorrow - A really great song.      7. The Frayed Ends of Sanity - This song has the most unsual sound and progression on the album.  One of the most underrated songs in Metallica's early history.    8. To Live is To Die - mainly an instrumental, this is the only song on Justice that has some of the dynamic musical quality provided by the late Cliff Burton.  It is the longest song on the album.  It is melodic and progressive, and also heavy and crunching.  If you like \\"Orion\\" from Master of Puppets, you'll probably love this one.  Take the opportunity to hear the last concept of the genious that was Cliff Burton.    9. Dyers Eve - The most aggressive song on the album, this is one of the best thrashy songs that Metallica ever put out.  It is as aggressive as \\"Battery\\", or \\"Whiplash\\", or \\"Fight Fire with Fire.\\"    --------------------------------------------------------------------------    If you've never heard Metallica's music before, don't start with this album.  Instead, pick up Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, or Metallica first.  But, if you have been a Metallica fan for some time and have yet to pick up this one, don't wait any longer.  It is a tremendous album; Metallica's most progressive outing thus far.
B000IZJ1KC|5.0|I have no idea where some reviewers are getting a Motorhead comparison here... they need to lay off the pipe, I think. <br /> <br />Except for the absence of crazy fast blastbeat-type drumming, this very well could have been a new Immortal album.  The vocals are vintage Abbath, as are the lyrics, but there's less trem-picking and blasting on the drums, so I'm guessing he didn't want to \\"dilute\\" the legendary(and deservedly so) Immortal legacy.  No worries - this album kicks major ***! <br /> <br />My favorite song is \\"Warriors\\" - hands down.  And horns up!  Abbath shows he is still relevant in the metal genre - so listen up, you young guns - Abbath ain't done yet!
B000002H97|5.0|The actual title for this one is \\"Metallica,\\" but all the fans call it \\"The Black Album.\\"  This might be Metallica's most controversial album besides \\"St. Anger.\\"  This album marks a concerted departure of the band from complex song structures and the like.  Because the sound is so simple throughout the album many have taken to call this \\"pop\\" metal.  I think that is a rash judgment, though.  Sure, the songs are simpler than on Metallica's previous effort, \\"...And Justice for All.\\"  But, this album might be one of their heaviest overall.  It is certainly Metallica's most popular album, having sold more than 14 million.  I don't think this album measures up to the greatness that was \\"Master of Puppets,\\" but then there are few albums in the history of metal that do that. <br /> <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />1. Enter Sandman - it would be hard to find people in either America or Europe, and probably other parts of the world, who have not heard \\"Enter Sandman.\\"  It is filled with the furious vocals and powerful riffs that we've come to love this band for.  This was the perfect opening song.  The song is about a seemingly never ending nightmare.  Heavy, heavy, heavy.  It begins with a traditional Metallica acoustic intro and leads straight into some of the heaviest metal out there. <br /> <br />I give \\"Enter Sandman\\" a 5/5 rating. <br /> <br />2. Sad But True - Even heavier than \\"Enter Sandman\\", this song is about reflecting on the contradictions and failures that often make up a person's life.  It has one of the heaviest crunches for a main riff that I've ever heard.  The song is not as good as the opener and it gets a little boring after much listening.  That is the problem with simpler songs.  They are easier to sell but the power in them seems to wane after extended play. <br /> <br />This one is a 4.5/5. <br /> <br />3. Holier than Thou - This song tries hard to be a kind of thrash exploit.  It doesn'tquite make it.  The theme centers around dealing with someone who is always judgmental, and never finding fault in themselves.  This is a heavy song, though not as heavy as the first two.  The advanced metal listener might think this one is at the top of their list from this album.  It is a good song, but not great. <br /> <br />I give it a 4/5. <br /> <br />4. Unforgiven - this one is about the mental anguish suffered by a man never allowed to have his moment.  It is a blend of acoustic lightness and metal heaviness that fascinates the listener.  This song of raging sorrow will get inside you and stay. <br /> <br />It is a clear 5/5. <br /> <br />5. Wherever I May Roam - my favorite song on this album.  It has a unique sounding acoustic opening that builds into one of the catchiest metal riffs of all time.  Ultimately, this song is about the power of freedom.  James Hetfield seems to clearly express his sense of arrival at the pinnacle of rock stardom, and the implicit respect that comes with it.  This is one of Metallica's all time best. <br /> <br />Certainly a 5/5. <br /> <br />6. Don't Tread on Me - use of the old American cliche might be either a focus against America's enemies or America's too easy determination to go to war, depending on your point of view of the song.  This one is almost as heavy as \\"Sad But True,\\" and is a very good song.  It is a bit repetitive, though, so it can become easily boring after many listens. <br /> <br />4/5 <br /> <br />7. Through the Never - perhaps one of the cleverest songs on the album.  \\"Questions pending...\\"  This one is about man's obsession with knowing all there is to know about the physical universe.  It could easily be a defense for the Evolution theory and a reproach for those who close their minds rather than try to understand the nature of things.  There is a good main riff and the song is not too long.  Great metal tune. <br /> <br />4.5/5. <br /> <br />8. Nothing Else Matters - this one is a mostly accoustic song about friendship and comraderie between the band members.  It is a good tune, but it is also one of those songs that brought the word \\"sellout\\" to the lips of many Metallica fans.  While not very heavy, it is a good song that is inspiring, though some of the lyrics are a little cheesy, imo. <br /> <br />4/5. <br /> <br />9. Of Wolf and Man - a great, great song.  James Hetfield's raging vocals and primal lyrics really set this song off.  The main riff is not as heavy as other Metallica tunes on this album, but the punch of the song is unmistakable.  This song is ostensibly about lycanthropy, or werewolves, but it touches base with the wolf in each man. <br /> <br />4.5/5. <br /> <br />10. The God that Failed - this song might be about the loss of Hetfield's mother to cancer when she refused to seek medical treatment because of her beliefs.  I've heard this explanation many times but I've never heard it confirmed by Mr. Hetfield.  Apparently, God failed to heal his mother when she refused treatment.  It is a good song with a solid riff.   <br /> <br />4/5 <br /> <br />11. My Friend of Misery - a good song about dealing with someone who will not leave you alone to think for yourself.  There is nothing but problems.  We can all identify with being around someone who just will not let go of their solution for everyone's problems.  This song is somewhat bass driven but not too complex.  It is very heavy but it is different from the typical metal song.  This one was not written to be popular, but observant and brutally truthful.  From a depth standpoint this song might be the strongest on the album. <br /> <br />4/5. <br /> <br />12. The Struggle Within - This song should be last because, imo, it is the weak point of the album.  I don't really know why Metallica included this one on this album.  It seems out of place and a little bit strange.  It has always been one of my least favorite songs from Metallica.  To be fair, it is heavy and fast and there are bound to besome listeners that enjoy this song very much.  I'm just not one of them. <br /> <br />2.5/5. <br /> <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />Metallica's fifth project is a very good one, though just shy of greatness.  I give it 5 stars on the weight of the great songs that are on the album.  For the initiate Metallica fan either this one, or \\"Ride the Lightning\\", is the place to start.  If you've never heard this album, or are new to the Metallica experience, then by all means buy this one.  It is not as commercialized as some people claim, but it is polished enough to be one of the most enjoyable listens in heavy metal history.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Its compact (a big space saver). and the fact that the dvds are store in books, helps prevent misplacement of the dvds!
B000BO0LKY|5.0|But I guess most of her CDs have a fair bit of screaming. But I digress.<br /><br />I'm gonna start off by also saying that we all shouldn't deny that Mariah's voice isn't what it was back when her first couple of albums were released, and she sounded like a sensitive angel that just needed to be heard. These days, however, it sounds a bit strained. It's not too bad, but you can definitely tell that it has waned a bit in power. When she gets to the shrieking, I don't like it.<br /><br />But really, I'm writing this review for a couple of reasons. But the main two are this:<br /><br />1. Overall, this CD is pretty damn good.<br /><br />2. Mariah is, and has been my favorite artist of all time thusfar. I loved her in her &#34;Vision Of Love&#34;, &#34;All I Want For Christmas&#34;, &#34;Dreamlover&#34; and &#34;Fantasy&#34; days. The music she makes now doesn't quite measure up as much, but is still pretty enjoyable to say the least. ^_^b<br /><br />Back to the songs on this particular CD though. There are a couple of songs I skip sometimes, but I wouldn't categorize them as bad. It's just sometimes Mariah gets the yelling and I have to skip 'em. Or she kinda bores me (I Wish You Knew or Joy Ride) Otherwise, this is a pleasant ride.<br /><br />If you don't have ANY of Mariah's albums though (who wouldn't have at least one if they are reading this?) I would start with either Emotions (1991) or Daydream (1995). But if you like your R&B music, then get this one. If you do get this one, make sure it's the Ultra Platinum Edition because the extra songs are TOTALLY worth it.<br /><br />The only reason I could see someone getting the original Emancipation is for the beautiful cover which is superior to this one. But don't both look great?!<br /><br />The highlights for me are:<br /><br />3. Shake It Off, 5. Say Something, 6. Get Your Number 8. One And Only, 9. Circles, 10. Your Girl, 14. Fly Like A Bird, 15. Don't Forget About Us and 16. Makin' It Last All Night (What It Do).<br /><br />This CD has many highlights.<br /><br />Mariah's writing has always been decent enough, and she doesn't stop writing for this one. She collaborates with other songwriters such as Jermaine Dupri, Pharrell Williams, Snoop Dogg, Kanye &#34;Omari&#34; West, Twista and notably, Babyface again.<br /><br />I hope you enjoyed my review. Have a look at my others if you would like.<br /><br />5 stars. ^_~<br /><br />End note: If you don't hear a ballad here, then it's a club-ready mid-tempo. Fantastic album from a true entertainer. I must see her in concert before I die. :^)(1997).    Mariah's writing has always been decent enough, and she doesn't stop writing for this one.

089381525X|5.0|I  was lucky enough to see this wonderfully humane expose and photographic genius while it was on tour at The Philadelphia Art Museum years ago.  At that time, I passed up buying this book at the Museum Store and regretted and searched in stores for it years later. <br />If this book were on everyone's coffee table and looked at page by page ... there would be much more respect and much less oppression in the world.  Good people would see to that.
0743289412|5.0|First a quick comment...if Stephen King wasn't a horror writer, he could have been one of the best science fiction writers of this generation. <br />Now...I don't understand all the negative reviews.  Maybe those folks just have short attention spans.  Maybe they've been spoiled by King's earlier work, or by the literary snobbery that says anything popular must have no merit. <br />Whatever... <br />I'm honestly not a big fan of Stephen King, but I loved \\"Lisey's Story.\\"  It pulled me immediately into all five of its worlds...Lisey's interior thought processes, the intricate world of her marriage, the public life of being married to a famous writer, the world of their extended families, and of course the fascinating and dangerous world of Boo'ya Moon.  And it never let go 'til the last page. <br />A big \\"THANK YOU!\\" to Mr. King, and a big \\"PHBBBBTT!!\\" to his detractors.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|Not even in BELOVED has a film director let Thandie Newton look so unglamorous and everyday.  You might pass her on the street without a second glance, which I think freed up something in Newton, allowing her to do some of her very best work here.  Of course she has a thankless part because nobody cares about her anyhow, as everyone has pointed out.  It's sort of like the way Meryl Streep is treated in KRAMER VERSUS KRAMER, except here she doesn't even get to come back at the end, not even a phone call to let her boy know she made it safely to New York.<br /><br />Am I the only one who watched all the extras to this movie and tried in vain to find out what happened to the little boy?  What's the mystery all about.  We find out in every corner of the menu that Chris Gardner became the most successful black enterpreneur of all time.  But what about the son?  Is he even alive?  Hope I'm not putting my foot in my mouth, but I'm curious.<br /><br />When Chris sells his bone scanning machine to the kindly doctor, he cashes his check at Ted's Market, which is on my block South of Market here in San Francisco.  There are big blowup photos all over the deli counter, shots of Will and Chris making nice with the store workers and other neighbors.  It's always fun to see a movie filmed in San Francisco, and I hate those people who quibble about locations, but if you live here you will laugh when you see that every San Francisco park seems to have a BART entrance at the corner, whereas in real life BART is built to service the most builtup sections of the Bay Area, not the country club locations.  I hate people like myself who nitpick about these matters!<br /><br />Finally, I better duck from the rotten tomatoes, but in my opinion little Jaden Christopher Smith is one of the worst child actors I've ever seen, and I give Will the same credit I gave Aaron Spelling for trying to make Tori a star despite unpromising credentials.
B00005NGAG|3.0|Two beautiful women meet by chance when one is being throttled by her boyfriend in an alley. The other also suffering an abusive relationship picks up a pipe to aid the woman and accidentally kills the man. The women concoct a kidnapping to cover up the murder but nothing goes as planned in this dark Comedy of Errors meets Thelma and Louise; except with a happier ending... at least for the women. It is a humorous, startling and entertaining film with a lot of evil men who like to threaten, control and abuse women. The women are meek and compliant in the beginning but really come into their own by the end.
B000GY729M|5.0|After listening to Hot Fuss and completey falling in love with it I thought that this band coulden't really get any better.Well guess what? They did.I recently went to there concert in Atlanta Ga and this band is even more amazing preforming these songs live.It is very very rare that i listen to an album where i do not have to skip songs.This album is one of those.Every song gives a whole differnt meaning and new sound.It definatly is added to my favorite all time album list.Buy this album and you will not be dissapointed at all!
B000QQFKYE|5.0|I strongly disagree with the person who says this movie has no plot. I just think it takes mental effort to stay focused and understand it. I have only seen it once so far, and quite frankly I was fading out during the last hour, so I def. need to watch it again, but it did make a lot of sense to me. I'm sure it will make sense in a different way to someone else. <br /> <br />The movie is pretty staightforward until the scene where Laura is having a romantic moment with her movie costar. She tells him \\"This is just like a scene from the movie.\\" and then realizes that the cameras are rolling, and gets disoriented. At this point the move really breaks from the reality thus far, which I appreciated since that moment was so awkward and tense. <br /> <br />The rest is very dreamlike. I have always thought that Eraserhead is the closest representation to my dreams than anything else in real life, and this picks up on that a bit. We see some of Nikki's dreams, where I believe she is dreaming about her lover's old flings all in one room. Her story runs parallel to the actors who tried to film this movie in Poland and died during filming, and their story is shown a bit. The male actor dies later on, which I had been anticipating. We also see the story that the woman told in the beginning panning out. <br /> <br />It is confusing and I need to watch it again. I highly recommend watching it in the theatre first since Mr.  Lynch is aware of his theatre audience and plays of off this. There are points of it that may never make sense to me, and some storylines that I don't quite see how they fit in. But I figure if I can anticipate events before they occur then it can't make no sense. This is a movie I feel I could talk about for hours, if only someone was willing to talk about it with me. It is quite an experience, I love the cinematography, the intense close-ups, the dark colors, the actors. I enjoy taking something to think about away from it. <br /> <br />A great movie.
B00000IGGA|5.0|In the categories of songwriting, creative arrangements, production value and pure mojo, this album is genius. More accessible than a lot of his work, still weird enough for the purists.
B000N3ST7A|4.0|I love Stevie Nicks, but it would be great to see her putting out a new CD.  Doesn't she already have at least two greatest hits packages (Timespace and the Box Set)?  Anyway, I don't know if she is planning to retire or has hit a song-writing block, but I really get tired when these artists continue to re-release compilations over and over again.  I guess there is money to be made; otherwise, record companies would not do it.  Still, to me, the point of \\"art\\" is art; not rehashing and repackaging old stuff over and over again for the almight dollar.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I came into the Browncoat thing a breech birth - I saw Serenity first, then Firefly. Oh man, what I missed the first time around! <br /> <br />Whedon's vision of the future is bleak at times - the rich will always be rich, the poor will always be poor and humanity never quite learns from its mistakes. I mean, they used up Earth and had to leave, but get into another planet and strip and plunder and thieve just like before.  <br /> <br />So now you get a new diversity - Western and Eastern cultures fuse. The rich adopt the decadence of both worlds - money, fine clothes, expensive homes and parties. The poor scrabble out an existence any way they can. Do some viewers find it odd? Sure at first - but just as the American West created a culture different from the ones the settlers left, so would this new society. What I loved about this show was that the more you understood where we'd come from, the more you understood where the characters were coming from.  <br /> <br />So we have shepherds and companions and girl mechanics.... and a doctor with a stick up his pigu and a crazy sister, a mercenary with a girl's name, a captain who's lost his faith, a pilot who plays with dinosaurs and the first officer who looks like an Amazon.  <br /> <br />But you also had humor and humanity. Sci-fi without aliens and rayguns? A western with spaceships?  <br /> <br />Oh gimme more!
B0002858YS|5.0|I will admit that i do like Sams Town better.But none the less this album is still absolutey fabolous.The Killers and Coldplay are the only 2 bands albums where i can listen to there albums without skipping songs.This band is just so fantasic in so many differnt ways and for all you people who think that they are just another average band i seriously think that is so false.Other than Franz Ferindad i really dont know any other band like The Killers.And even Franz doesn't really stand up to The Killers.Also these guys are mind blowing live.I've recentyl attended there concert in Atlanta and it was the best show i've been to.I will be a killers fan for a long long time and there cd's will never leave my car cd player lol
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|A Beautiful lie is my first 30 Seconds to Mars CD. After listening to it thoroughly, I can't wait for their next album. <br />Every song has a different sound to it, which makes the CD even better because you really can't put a certain theme on it--I like that. <br />I especially like 'The Kill', 'A beautiful lie', 'Attack' and 'From Yesterday', but that is not to say that I dislike any of the other songs: each one is fantastic in its own right.   <br />Appart from Panic! At the Disco's Debut Album, \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" is my favorite CD of 2005.  <br />With this album, 30 Seconds to Mars has won itself a good position in my highly-coveted (at least I think so) list of favorite bands. <br />Anyone who wishes to spend some money on some quality rock-punk-emo music, should definitely look no further.
B000BMSTMS|3.0|\\"Twisted Transistor\\" is kind of a cool song, and there are a handful of other songs on here that are pretty good, like \\"Coming Undone\\", \\"Politics\\", and \\"Souvenier\\", but I don't know if I like this stripped down, industrial sound that they have tried on. It has some moments, but overall, I was unimpressed with it. Stick to earlier Korn if you are just discovering them, and if you buy it, plan on being surprised by the new musical direction.

B0002NRRAG|5.0|I heard \\"You're gonna Leave Me Lonesome When You're Gone\\" on the radio a while back and thought how great she sounded. The next day she was still in my mind and I called the radio station and they told me who she was. I was dead broke, wasn't getting paid for another week. . . and I went down and bought the CD. I listened to it through nights of Top Ramen and ice water-- ramen never tasted so good! <br /> <br />The whole CD is great. Each song makes me feel like I am in some European tavern. This is music that just makes you feel good. My teenagers listened to it and I got them to quit listening to their R&B long enough to ask who she was. One resumed playing the guitar that she'd given up a few years ago. <br /> <br />The CD is haunting and stays in your mind long after you turn it off.
1582701709|5.0|Got to say I was somewhat doubtful about what the secret can do in your life, but after reading it and using it's principles I've got to say I believe. Thoughts and visualizations are powerful, but it's up to the individual to stay on track. I no longer worry about finding a parking place up close. It's almost always there when I see it in my mind first. One of the things I like about the book is that it is not cluttered up with religious stuff. If you want the religious connections I think there are some books that include it.
B000NVIXFK|1.0|I've been a Rush follower and devouted listener since day one.  However, I can't let this unjustice go on any longer.  I gave them lots of time since Vapor Trails came out, but this time, they've gone too far.  This album is like a slap in the face to us die hard Rush fans, period.  The word \\"cheesy\\" really comes to mind.  Terribly mixed.  Drums sound horrid.  <br />They have heavily relied on overdubbing for the vocals and backgrounds.  So disappointed.  Nothing \\"new\\" from them as you'd expect from Moving Pictures and the evolution from there on out.  It's like a step backwards.  You know how some songs just stick in your mind over and over?  There are none on this album.  I hate to say it, but ever since Neil \\"returned\\", they have not been the band they were.  Their style is very predictable.  The drumming that has helped mould Rush into Rush, is simply not there.  There are no new techniques, sounds or innovations.  There is a little bit more off beats, but nothing to enhance style.  The quality of recording has gone done. Lay off the click tracks for the drums and actually record the drums themselves.  In the past, Rush had always wrote material that was very distinctive.  Not any more.  The last two albums have not attributed anything to maintain their place in elite status.  I'd even go as far as saying that if this was a band by any other name than Rush, this album wouldn't even get a consideration.  It's that bad and that's the road Rush is traveling now. I get the feeling that Rush has developed an attitude like Neil has over the years and just don't really care what the fans are saying.  They know that whatever they build, we will come.  Not any longer from me.  The last great \\"Rush\\" album was Geddy Lee's solo one.  Geesh, if this is the best you can do, then go down in style and retire from the scene so we can at least have the best of the good stuff and not this dog food your trying to feed us.
1594489505|5.0|Isolated by mountains and insulated in traditions, Afghanistan has been landscaped through geo-political tectonics into a contemporary Thermopylae battleground. A fractured country that was grudgingly reconciling a traditional past with an emancipating future began to crumble under the confluence of enflamed passions and heavy-handed retribution. Khaled Hosseini offers us safe-passage into this maelstrom to reveal to us \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns.\\" (But don't forget to pack your handkerchiefs.)       Khaled Hosseini's Afghanistan is a nation of proud people, who are steeped in tradition and fiercely struggle for family. It is a nation in primal turmoil: the country governed by AK-47's, the home ruled by the back of the hand, and the mind fettered by collective dogma. Society clinches and can only offer a tenuous and desperate existence for its disenfranchised citizens.      The story follows the intersecting lives of Mariam and Laila who emerge scarred from personal traumas, labeled social outcasts. They are swept up together into a shared nightmare under the brutal dominion of Rasheed. They begin as strangers in conflict but discover a common bond through their anguish, strength, sacrifice and dreams.      Hosseini's wonderful story is engrossing, emotional and spiritual. The author achieves new literary heights as he explores transgression and redemption, the ephemeral and the enduring, avarice and sacrifice, and ultimately, evil and good. All of the characters are judged in this manner, stripped raw as they plunge through the travails of Afghanistan, of Kabul, of their demons. It is then that the shroud of war becomes transparent and we can rejoice with Hosseini in the warmth and brilliance of \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns.\\"

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love this. It's hard to pin down why. The cast are just really likeable - great, spirited ensemble acting. I've got to episode 9 and I'm trying to put off watching the rest because I don't want it to end. Is it great sci-fi? No, not really - there's a smattering of sci-fi sets and effects but it's more that the roving spaceship scenario allows themes from almost every genre to crop up and the characters and cast bring them to life so enjoyably. It's just starting to pick up and set out themes for development when it ends.  Please can we have some more of this.
0394800389|5.0|As a community theater director, I was running out of tongue-twisters for the traditional vocal warmups when I remembered \\"Fox in Socks.\\" I brought my dogeared copy down to the theater and ever since, it's been part of my standard backstage warmup repertoire. Even the most jaded actors light up in grins when I lead them through the Tweedle Beetle Battle.
032147404X|2.0|I have been taking digital photos for a few years and recently upgraded my camera to have more control over my pictures.  I also read a few books to learn specifically about the differences between digital and 35mm photography.  After reading the reviews of this book I expected to be dazzled with useful information.  I was not.  Here are some of the reasons. <br />*The author is not a very good writer.  He tries to be funny and he is not (to my taste anyway).  The author is very preoccupied by his own status.  He is constantly talking about his famous photographer friends, blah, blah, blah.  I thought this was going to be a book about hands-on technique...Show the photos and explain how they were taken. <br />*The quality of the book is poor.  The book is small and the paper and printing are cheap.  The paper is magazine quality. <br />*It seems that nearly half the photos in the book are stock photos, not taken by the author.  That surprised me. <br /> <br />This book might be okay if you know abolutely nothing about photography but I found it simple and uninspiring.  There was no single photo in this book by Mr. Kelby that made me say \\"wow\\". <br /> <br />I found [[ASIN:0817435522 The Betterphoto Guide to Digital Photography (Amphoto Guide Series)]] to be a far superior book; well written with great photos, all by the author.

B00004YZ36|3.0|In its time, this cycle of concertos was state-of-the art.  One of the signal pleasures of this cycle today is how both Anda and the orchestra sound like they're having an enormous amount of fun.  That comes through everywhere, even with the caveats below.    Some of the performances hold up fairly well.  20 and 24, in particular, are still among the best performances of those concertos ever recorded.  But overall, the sound and performance are dated.    The orchestral playing in this set was never the greatest, too-often a bit ragged, and intonation in the strings is occasionally hit-and-miss.  The winds were quite good for the time, being a bunch of big-time soloists of that era (including people like flutist Aurele Nicolet)...but even they sound a little out at times.    Anda's playing was reasonably stylish for the time.  Certainly better than that of many pianists who came later.  But given the evolution of Mozart-style in the last 40 years, his playing now sounds a little too plain-jane.  Nothing particularly wrong with just playing the music, but Anda is a bit too uninflected to be interesting.  And, like nearly every other pianist who should know better, he plays the inferior publisher's solo part for #26...an unforgiveable act even then.    Still, all-in-all, hard to beat for the money, and an adequate introduction to some of Mozart's greatest music, but only adequate.   Anda is nearly eclipsed by Bilson and Gardiner.  By Immerseel and Anima Aeterna, and would have been totally eclipsed by Levin and Hogwood, had they completed that much-lamented incomplete cycle.    Barenboim, Ashkenazy, Uchida and Perahia are all tastelessly un-stylish.  Each in their own special way.  To my ears, those recordings are just about unlistenable, in their day, and now.  Anda beats these handily.  But they are not the standard these days.  They never were.    Andreas Staier and Concerto Koln give a sense of what's really possible in this music, and may have set a kind of standard for insight and virtuosity that has yet to be surpassed..it is truly tragic that Staier has not recorded any more Mozart concertos, beyond the four he did some seven years ago now.    Too bad Ivan Moravec never recorded all the Mozart concertos.  That would have been something to hear.  The ones he did record are right at the top of the heap, for sure.      I'd probably go with Brendel if you want a complete cycle with modern piano.  Hard to beat Brendel in anything, although the ASMIF is a mediocre band at best, and you can only wish Brendel had recorded with someone else.    In short, finding top-flight Mozart piano concerto recordings, even now, with the enormous number of them out there, is still a hit/miss proposition.  And finding a complete cycle on modern piano that really *gets* Mozartean style, is damned near impossible.   That would be a real milestone in recording history:  a cycle of Mozart piano concertos, with modern instruments, that truly delivers stylistically, and the pianist plays with the kind of freedom Mozart would have, not following the score so slavishly as nearly all recordings do, including, especially, Anda, who should have known better.      No-one's done it yet.  But, maybe someone will, someday.

The book is full of info for literally every point and circumbstance on the planet. It is a book that you will use, demolish while using it and you will buy another copy because you used this one too much. The only regret I have of this book (and why I give it 4 stars) is not the content but the book itself. It is not sturdy enough. The content itself is a mini library to survival around the globe.

0061148512|2.0|Ya know how an artist's work isn't worth much until he/she dies? Well this is what happened here. Now I see why it wasn't going to be published when she was alive. Because it is BORING!(The book was published 6 weeks after Sylvia Plath committed suicide. Things always sell better after they are dead.)  The entire first half of the book is so monotoned I found myself putting the book down quite often. I kept thinking \\"when will she go insane and be interesting?\\" I have to say that her description of things was intelligently written it was just so BORING! <br /> <br />Let me sum the book up for you and save you the money....girl gets job in NY, girl meets boy, girl dumps boy, girl goes slightly insane, girl goes into a rehab/asylum, girl is up for getting out of the asylum, book ends......just like that! The worst ending ever!  <br /> <br />I really am torn by giving authors a poor rating because I know how hard they work on their writing but this book was just arrrgghhh boring.

I like the first song cool aggressive pick-up. <br />I have heard other Megadeth in the past, the music is original so you cant expect it to sound like something you have heard. This CD is easy to understand but its original the 'ol Megadeth Mustaine style. If thats how you will recieve it. <br /> <br /> If you like Megadeth you will like this CD for sure. Worth me waking up and listening to this CD before going to work. Good job Dave Mustaine! Lets hope this wakes up Metallica! <br /> <br />This CD reminds me to go out and buy other Megadeth CDs that I dont have.
B000296GVG|1.0|The Michael J. Pollard cameo is cute. Jerry Lewis is always interesting. Faye Dunaway still looks great. Johnny Depp gives an excellent performance, but it is another of his Edward Scissorshands distant characters. Lili Taylor also gives an excellent performance. Vincent Gallo's character is just too easy to do, so no points there.    So why the low rating? This is another of the current chic and trendy narratives that features \\"quirkiness\\" as a substitute for inquiry or reflection. There is no statement here. Things happen, and the virtue is in the nonsequitor and jarring juxtaposition of events. People of average ability should not be given big film budgets. And writers have to drill down a little further into the model novel \\"100 Years of Solitude\\" to find out that there is a *structure* underlying the mysteriousness of life depicted there.    But it so much easier to be a *fresh* director whose worldview is that all the \\"ism's\\" have been exhausted, and only absurdism reigns now. That is not correct, as movie-making itself is a form of \\"consumerism\\". And this film dishes out enough of the in-demand absurdism to satisfy the market, that's for sure.    As an antidote to this trend, read John Gardner, \\"On Moral Fiction\\" (available here at Amazon). It's not a stodgy right-wing Walt Disney thing at all. Gardner was a hard leftist, but one who had good theories about fiction and narrative.
B00005JPD0|1.0|The first half hour of Deja Vu is like being forced to watch overly melodramatic CNN/MSNBC news coverage of 9/11 or the tsunami.  Anyone who was alive during 9/11 has already had a lifetime overdose of news coverage of terrorist tragedy - I don't need a film to present the same.  The few shots that cut away from big band military music, flaming bodies and crying bystanders are straight from a bad, made-for-TV movie - Denzel gazing steely eyed at clues like grease smears under a bridge while mouthing soap opera'esque explanatory bomb specifics to the police.  And these few lines of awful dialogue only occur about half hour into the movie.  I'm serious, no one says a word for the first quarter of the film! Once again Hollywood cranks out another movie that lacks a plot or screenplay and has forgotten to be entertaining.  Not even the promise of staring at Denzel Washington for two hours could keep me awake.  The only entertaining moment is seeing Val Kilmer's beyond bloated face and neck appear on the screen and wondering how the neck of a 600 pound man could fit on the only marginally over weight Kilmer.  Bad Liposuction perhaps?  That's the only mystery worth pondering in Deja Vu.  Still lacking any semblance of a plot or more than five lines of dialogue, the movie starts showing close ups of burned and mutilated body parts, including severed children's hands.  Considering I was eating dinner, and not only bored but extremely irritated by the film at this point, I turned it off.  It was forty minutes into the film and they still hadn't gotten to anything to do with the manipulation of time - which was what sounded interesting about the movie to begin with.  While watching I kept thinking about how pathetic this era would seem to future historians looking back on the decade of \\"terror\\" - where every action film uses terrorists as the stock villain now replacing the Bolsheviks in the bathroom.  Deja Vu is not only dumb but out right pissed me off for trying so pathetically to manipulate emotions associated with the fear of terrorism.  The only thing I'm afraid of is how mainstream it has become to sell brainless propaganda as entertainment.cally to manipulate emotions associated with the fear of terrorism.

B000KRNG5E|2.0|Apart from one knockout horror sequence (with the heroine swimming in an underwater chamber) this movie never really catches fire. The performances are very poor, in marked contrast to Suspiria. The music is also strangely sedate for a horror film, also in contrast to Suspiria. The look of the film partly makes for the lack of real horror, but only in certain spots. Overall a disappointment.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Alright, so I like Smallville, and I enjoy watching Heroes, and The 4400 is entertaining. But I absolutely love Supernatural.

B000065U1N|4.0|It's a great movie for a guy who just endured a chick flick with his girl.  It puts manhood back in you!
B000JLTRKE|1.0|Oliver Stone is a movie maker, his bottom line isn't to tell us the truth , its to make as much money as he can. September 11th, being so close to all of our hearts and souls, and it being so soon after the fact, Is a hard story to tell especially in regards to the survivors and victims. Stone did not choose to tell this story, in all its heroism and individual sacrifice, in the light of truth. Instead he decided to bend and twist these men's rescue and the rescuers stories to his \\"bottom line\\" agenda. In the movie NYPD officer Scott Strauss is the man who crawls through hell to get to John and Will, in real life it was Chuck Sereika. Chuck had absolutely NO training in search and rescue and extrication, He was a paramedic who thought for sure he was crawling to his own death. In interviews with Chuck after viewing the movie said \\"the facts are so distorted that he didn't recognize what he was seeing as what he lived through\\" A journalist who was at ground zero and did first hand interviews of both the rescuers and Will and John at the hospital asked the filmmakers if they wanted his input, and was declined. Oliver Stone chose to focus on the men trapped, flashbacks, family grief instead of on the true life harrowing story of the rescuers and their unbelievable acts.<br /><br />Stone missed many real facts that should have been put into the movie, and he added some that weren't necessary<br /><br />1) Karnes, the man who dons his marine garb and sneaks onto ground zero, did not spout religious phrases to passerby's. He refused to be any part of the film.<br /><br />2) The Other marine who shows up to help Karnes was a black guy, not a white guy<br /><br />3) They completely left out a firefighter named Tommy Asher, officer Richard Doeler, and John Busching former detective now paramedic in new york. ALL of those men were VITAL to the rescue effort!! Doeler literally DUG out John with his bare hands, with no oxygen tank. It was Doerler, along with two FDNY firefighters, who finally pulled McLaughlin to safety after three hours of digging. In the movie, a team made up solely of firemen extricates McLaughlin. In real life, Doerler came in to relieve many other rescue workers who had been digging for about five hours and working sometimes in 20-minute shifts as the conditions were too difficult to withstand any longer amount of time. Doerler fashioned scoops out of metal scraps, as his usual hand shovel wouldn't fit at first. But none of these dramatic details come through in the movie. Doerler, like Strauss and Sereika before him, had to straddle the trapped officer's body in order to fit in the narrow space, balancing himself on his right arm and reaching out with his left to pull out the mashed concrete and twisted metal bits--a task made more difficult by the fact that he is right-handed. he says that the filmmakers never called him once to hear his story firsthand. Doerler said he hoped his character would be included, not for his own credit but so that the world would know what the Nassau County Emergency Service Unit did that day<br /><br />4) The wife of Dominick Pezzulo, the NYPD officer who died along side John and Will is outraged at the filmmakers saying \\"my thing is, this man died for you, how could you do this to this family?\\"  Obviously scarred enough by his death, but also scarred again by the onscreen death as well, and not in a true light.<br /><br />Most people will watch this movie and take it as the truth, for how could someone make a movie about Sept 11 and leave out crucial, and important details, especially to tell a tale of \\"heroism and perseverance\\"?. Clearly it's because the filmmakers didn't care about the people who were really involved, they were out to fill their pockets. Don't buy this movie, don't watch it. Instead I would recommend, if you are curious about the truth of that day, to watch \\"9/11 The filmmakers commemorative addition\\" which is footage shot on that very day of the events unfolding and the heroism of the firefighters and NYPD involvedfirefighters and NYPD involved <br />
B0000AQS0F|1.0|I'm just writing this review to let readers know that not everyone likes Firefly. I am a pretty big Fan of the Sci-Fi genre as well as the Western genre, but I have had a hard time making it through these episodes. The dialogue is poor, the story is boring and the music is ridiculous. The quality of the show never rises above the 1983 film Yor: The Hunter from the Future. I'm thankful that FOX cancelled the show and I hope that it is never brought back in any way. It's actually pretty unbelieveable that FOX let it on for 14 episodes! I would rather watch Mama's Family than this nonsense. The series proposes to be 500 years in the future, but for some reason people are riding horses, carrying revolvers and speaking Mandarin Chinese in the future. This seems incredibly unbelievable.<br /><br />What's funny is that all of the Firefly fans are going to say that my review was not helpful. But if you are not into cheesy Sci-Fi, bad dialogue, boring stories, then I actually think that my review will be helpful to you. You'd be better off if you spent your evening gnawing off your own arm, than you would be watching this program.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|The number of negative reviews here, esp. of the \\"I didn't get, it left me baffled\\" type, even after 5 years of blood-for-oil war on 2 fronts, is a directly proportional gauge of the self indulgent ignorance of Americans at large regarding their own oil addiction and its genocidal consequences.<br /><br />A possible cure is for these willfully cretinous simpletons to buy the DVD and watch the 2nd \\"special feature\\" , \\"Participate & make a difference/change\\".<br /><br />This film is the best you can hope for from Hollywood regarding geopolitical analysis, and readily stands up to multiple viewing, but, without more than two brain cells to rub together, or the lack of self discipline to think any harder than necessary to watch Wizard of Oz, even Tinseltown's best efforts are wasted as pearl before swine, a Biblical reference for Jack Abramoff's captive gospel thumping flag wrapped \\"patriots\\" in hope it might be their access to enlightment as to, and thereby salvation from, their sins perpetrated in the name of the marketed greed branded as civic duty to consume like locusts.<br /><br />If you still don't get it but want to, READ THE BOOK by Robt Baer.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Where can I start with is classic?  It has all of the famous Monty Python skits (missing is the parrot skit) and is still hilarious -- viewing after viewing.  The material, after all of these years, is still fresh.  My fourteen year old niece recently saw the movie for the first time and it has become one of her favorites.  Buy this movie or...I'll turn you into a newt!
0061139378|5.0|I really enjoyed this clever little novella, but then again, I enjoy mostly everything from Gaiman. This is a story of young Coraline (though often mistakenly, and to her despair, called Caroline) - a bored and curious girl who longs for an adventure. As is expected from Gaiman, the story contains comically eccentric characters, a talking cat, a sudden dark twist to an otherwise ordinary day, and one very stubborn main character. <br /> <br />Though intended for a young audience (indeed Gaiman originally set out to write this for his daughter), the story actually gets quite chilling (he does admit his daughter used to have a bit of Wednesday Addams about her). Kidnapped, soulless children trapped in a mirror, an Other Mother who looks like Coraline's mother (except that her eyes are made of black buttons) a body-less hand stalking Coraline outside her window at night...creepy! But in a good way! <br /> <br />The writing itself is simple enough for it to be a children's book, but that doesn't take away from the experience for the adult reader. In fact, it gives the book a sense of fun and lightness that counters the gothic horror of the plot. <br /> <br />I recommend picking up Coraline if you are a fan of Gaiman's work, or if you are looking for a cute, quick book to read on the train. And what's more, an animated movie is being made based on the book. I'm not usually a fan of animation and would much rather see this go the way of Mirror Mask, BUT the fantastic news is that the brilliant Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders are doing the voices of the wacky neighbors. But things always get lost in translation from book to screenplay, so do yourself a favor and read the novella first.
B000GCFO0I|4.0|The movie captures the feel of the game, although it doesn't follow it lock-step. I thought the first 3/4 was awesome, but the finish is kinda weak. Still a must see--especially if you were a fan of the game. The first time when she's walking down the stairs.. and the horn goes off and everything goes dark.. wicked scene. The \\"dark world\\" scenes are awesome. <br />Highly recommended.
0679745653|5.0|Holiday Golightly. She's quirky, comical, and glamorous. She's fashionable, in-the-know, and in-the-now. She's lonely, lost, and waiting to be rescued. You couldn't resist her charm if you tried, and you can't help but fall in love with her.<br /><br />Well, at least in the Hollywood film version. Capote's original novella paints a darker portrait of Miss Golightly. Unlike Audrey Hepburn's adorable Holly, who needs a knight in slightly-rusted armor to save her, Capote's girl is a \\"wild thing\\" who cannot be caged, trained, or rescued.<br /><br />I can't deny that the film is a classic and is one of my favorites. Audrey Hepburn may be the epitome of glamour and beauty, and Hollywood's Holly can't help but absorb Audrey's charm. By the end of the film you find yourself rooting for \\"Fred\\" to save her from the nonsense of high society, reunite her with the cat, and wipe away her case of \\"the mean reds\\" forever. That is Hollywood, after all, and we would expect nothing less.<br /><br />But the real Holly, Capote's Holly, can never be caged by convention. It would be hard to imagine her ever settling down and being content with Fred (regardless of the fact that he is an implied homosexual in the book. Hollywood seemed to have \\"overlooked\\" that).<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it's not that the book's Holly is a Bad Person; she's just more layered and real. Think about it - how many people have you come across who create a new persona for themselves, based on what they perceive others to desire? People who feign interest in the popular styles/entertainment/notable people of the day, just to seem like a Very Important Person and garner adoration, fame, and possibly fortune. I could name a few.<br /><br />But we get to go deeper than Holly's exterior and see the scared and lonely girl at the core. She is terrified of being a caged animal, but also tired of being alone. She wants to seem as though she's making a holiday out of life, but struggles with the need for stability and the desire for freedom.<br /><br />The book I read also included three of Capote's most famous stories, and I'd be remiss not to mention them as well: House of Flowers, A Diamond Guitar, and A Christmas Memory. The three short stories are amazingly intimate and touching, illuminating different sides of human emotion. I have not read Capote's magnum opus, In Cold Blood, but after witnessing his detailed descriptions and haunting perceptions of human nature in these shorter forms, I have added his novel to my \\"to-read\\" list.
0743504984|5.0|I got this as a gift for my husband.  He is really hard to buy for, but I struck a winner with this gift. He said that he really enjoyed listening to the cd.  As he was listening, he could see parts of the movie in his mind.
B000002L3P|5.0|Kenny Wayne Shepherd, in his first CD, is amazing.  There will be the inevitable comparisons to Stevie Ray Vaughan (and perhaps Jonny Lang), but the tone and style of his super guitar playing are different than SRV.  (Note that I did not say better than....)  There is a wide range of SRV style blues and playing along with acoustic, slide and such.  I am glad that I bought this thoroughly enjoyable CD and can recommend it to all who like electric guitar blues, Delta blues and more!
B000MNP2KI|1.0|The Broccoli's, and now Sony, have been ruining this series since Goldfinger and now they have cast the worst possible choice to play Bond. Craig is so far removed from what Bond was meant to be it's painful, but what does it matter? Since 1964 these stories have not been true James Bond adventures, at least not what Ian Fleming had in mind. Now they cast the most ridiculous choice in Daniel Craig, a humorless, trailorpark thug (which he is good at and should stay) that looks absolutely ridiculous in a tuxedo and kissing the heroine. That's Bond? <br />The producers have finally put a stake in the coffin of this legendary hero and the sad United States box office take for this film reflects that (Casino failed to have as high attendance as Brosnan's \\"Die Another Day\\" here in the States) Hopefully the studio will take this into consideration and bounce this sorry excuse for a spy out of here and try and finally do this series right(I'm not holding my breath)
0743496728|5.0|Picoult proves again why she is today's most popular author.  Nineteen Minutes, like her other books, is intriguing, sickening, emotionally draining and worth reading.
B000084T18|1.0|Nowadays, whenever you think of the name \\"50 Cent\\", you would think about the commercial hip pop idol that doesn't care about his music and he thinks he's tough because he's been shot 9 times. Truth is, he was shot AT nine times, only 3 of the bullets hit him (one in the jaw, one in each leg). The real \\"50 Cent\\" was a robber known as Kelvin Martin, and he survived many bullet wounds (24 to be exact), but tragically, he died from the wounds in 1987.<br /><br />Luckily, Martin doesn't have to live in a time when hip hop has reached its demise and is overflooded by fake, overmarketed hip pop idols such as Fiddy Cent. This CD is just proof that you don't need talent to make it big, and if you have talent, the media could care less.<br /><br />First off, Fiddy can't rap to save his life. It might be the bullet that hit his jaw, but this guy sounds like a complete mess. Plus, there is multiple repetitiveness in lyrical content. The background beats are rather annoying and have no depth or soul to them. It's just nauseating. Listen to the song \\"In Da Club\\". It's hard to understand what he's saying, because he slurs throughout the chorus.<br /><br />Overall, avoid this album like it's a WMD headed for your ears. You'll thank me later.
B000O75F7C|5.0|Great stuff. The entire album is in the set list for the current tour - an excellent show!
0887307280|5.0|So you have a great business idea....so what!  According to Michael Gerber, ideas are a dime a dozen.  Unless you execute that idea in an effective way, its destined for headache, heartache, and bankruptcy.  The McDonalds model is the focus of the book in inviting you, the reader, to not just say, \\"Hey, I can make great burgers, why don't I sell them for a profit.\\"  Rather say, \\"Hey, I can make great burgers, at a great price, with a flawless system, that anyone anywhere in the world can do and it will come out exactly the same...give or take a pickle or two.\\"  Now you have a great company that is destined for success!  Look out McDonalds of the world, here comes competition.

B000053VAZ|5.0|Johnny Depp is a wonderful character actor, with such a wide range of ability.  This is, hands down, the best movie he has ever made.  I loved him as Capt. Jack Sparrow, and he was fantastic in The Secret Window, as well as his many other roles, but he is just phenomenal as Sam, a quirky young man who falls in love with a mentally ill young woman.  He brought such warmth and humor to the role.  I can't see anyone else playing sam.
1594489505|3.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns is well worth the read.  It's lovely and breathes life into a place very far away from us - in miles as well as spirit.  It will, of course, be compared to The Kite Runner and I, myself, feel compelled to do so.  I found the characters in The Kite Runner to be more three-dimensional, less stereotypical and more vivid.  These characters, by contrast, were less different from one another, less real, less deep and rich and fully drawn.  Still, the reader does care about them and about their decisions, their fate, their ultimate capacity to \\"hang together\\".  I remember reading somewhere that the ending of The Kite Runner was written one way and the author forced to change it to be more American-ized and more Hollywood.  I remember feeling somewhat vindicated because I'd recognized that the ending didn't quite gel with the rest of the book's power.  I felt he'd taken the easy way out.  In this new book, too, I feel he's learned a bit of the Hollywood novel writing technique and we see it in the predictability and one-dimensionality.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed the story, cared what happened, learned more about the countries I've only gotten to read about in newspapers and the book breathed life into an otherwise opaque world.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Never has a film been so aptly titled!<br /><br />\\"The Departed\\" tells the story of two Boston cops - one called Billy (played by Leonardo di Caprio) who is \\"good\\" and one called Colin (played by Matt Damon) who is most certainly rotten. Colin is using his power and influence to protect his gangster father-figure Costello (Jack Nicholson).<br /><br />The police know that they have a traitor in their midst so two investigators - a wise old cop Queenan (Martin Sheen) and a young tyro Dignam(Mark Wahlberg) have secretly asked Billy to infiltrate Costello's gang to find out who the mole is.<br /><br />So begins a race against time between Billy and Colin to see who gets \\"outed\\" first.<br /><br />Scorsese has humbly described \\"The Departed\\" as a genre movie. But it is more than that - sure it's a bloodthirsty gangster film with more than a few credibility issues - but this is Scorsese in top gear.  The concentrated energy and almost stylised nature of the plot gives \\"The Departed\\" an operatic quality.<br /><br />Scorsese draws superb performances out of the big-name cast - did I mention Alec Baldwin as the wonderfully oily Chief of Police?<br /><br />Truly exciting film-making from this master film-maker.
B000A6T1JU|3.0|WARRIORS (1979) is a quintessential late 1970's movie partly in from <br />the automobiles shown, the debilitated housing and neighborhoods <br />specifically chosen,  and the cheesy 70's era hard rock soundtrack. <br /> <br />Its strength is that it touches on  the basic survival and <br />self-preservation instincts that people  have when in danger. Some <br />may have come to recognize this as fear, and the reaction that ensues <br />in varying degrees. Those in the military know this well, in combat, <br />for example. <br /> <br />The story stresses the need for physical fitness (running, jogging, <br />weight lifting) and excellence in one-to-one hand combat to properly <br />engage opposing gangs. At the time, this did not encompass gun powder <br />weaponry, as the arms perhaps were difficult to obtain, and the minds <br />of the gangs did not see a need for mortality, but rather, \\"just\\" <br />baseball bats, switch blades, molotov cocktails, physical brutality, <br />arson of vehicles, subway stations, etc. <br /> <br />Above all, what works most, is the amusement and the reaction to a <br />host of ridiculous scenarios, such as a policewoman working <br />undercover in a park, looking to actively entrap johns or rapists. <br />Other examples are the fashion or clothing selections of some gangs <br />(purple vests anyone?), or even the intro that suggests this plot <br />being on the same level as the ancient wars told by Homer in respect <br />of the Greeks and Trojans before the Roman Empire. <br /> <br />The formation of gangs is not entirely unrealistic, in some respects, <br />as they are often built by ethnicity, with the Warriors being the <br />sole exception. <br /> <br />The plot is reasonable, starting with a jamboree of sorts attempting <br />to get various gangs to unite together, for profit maximization of <br />their untold activities, with the except of a gang of anarchists. <br /> <br />The role of the police is well presented, as they are shown as being <br />effective, against literally dozens of platoons of thugs, mainly <br />comprised of youths who seem to have unlimited amounts of free time <br />on their hands, mainly in the evenings and at night, in the public <br />transportation systems of NYC and streets. <br /> <br />Amusingly, but unrealistically, a Radio DJ comes on from time to <br />time, with her score sheet (as if assisting to a boxing match), to <br />provide the listeners with the latest on the gang strife. (This is <br />the same actress that shows up in Enzo Castellari's movie, as a gang <br />leader of stylish dancers in New Barbarians.) <br /> <br />With NYC's dark underbelly (neighborhoods) exposed, it  brings into <br />focus the territorial limits, that gangs feel should not be crossed <br />by opposing ones, as a matter of pride and of economic control. <br /> <br />Although this DVD is not a true wide-screen release, it does not <br />distract at all from the action. The filming is good, sharp and good <br />quality, well edited, if not for the erroneous artistic choice of <br />using cartoons in between scenes, unfortunately, which takes the <br />audience out of their surreal experience. <br /> <br />The eye-candy of Deborah Van Valkenburgh obviously works well, as a <br />contrast to the bleak subway scenes, and to the combat and action <br />scenes, yet, implausible in her eagerness to forego her own gang and <br />join Swan. <br /> <br />In sum, Warriors is obviously a popular movie among a segment of the <br />population, above all, those below 15 or 21, or those in high <br />schools, owing to the interaction and interplay between gangs and <br />within the gangs, that is one-on-one, consistently, which makes the <br />action personal to the audience, never anonymous, impersonal, or <br />inconsequential. In 2007, the music is a liability, as it has no hip <br />hop or other styles that were invented and now dominate radio.
B000P2A256|5.0|Ok, so we all saw it...the weird haircuts, and awful live performance on American Idol that made us all wander if Levine and Co. had sold out? Wonder is a great song, true Maroon 5, but it seemed a bit like Levine was just trying to cooly write a cuss word into a song to make it a hit. The American Idol performance was a mess! And I kept trying to pretend it sounded better than it did..... <br />But now that the CD is here.....whew! Rest easy- because our boys just delievered another gem! <br /> <br />There are a lot of emotional high's a low's here. There are some songs with some definite 80's qualities, like \\"Not falling apart\\", then \\"Kiwi\\" a total jam session, and very beautiful dramatic songs like we experienced on their first album- back again with songs- \\"Goodnight, Goodnight\\" and \\" Better that we break\\" both equally pretty. The CD features their full rendition of \\"Nothing lasts forever\\" the song sampled in a Kanye West song, slower here, and softer. A few songs sound a little like they are straight from JT (Timberlake) like Little of your time. I think it's because they're a little more pop this time around, but JT is also bridging the gap as his style has morphed closer to their style. Maroon 5 is just different than what you are hearing from other bands right now, and their unique quality and Levine's unique voice is what made them uber-popular a few years ago. Songs you will love if you love the very first album are \\"Wake up call\\", and \\"Can't Stop\\". They are very classically \\"Maroon 5 material\\"  <br />Levine's high pitch, make songs like \\" If I never see your face\\" ultra sexy...not to mention that every song drips with his confidence.  <br />You won't be disappointed if you liked the first album, and there definitely is no sophmore slump here. If you only loved the first album because of songs like \\"Driving slow on Sunday morning\\" you won't find much of that here. The CD does have some slow pretty music, but closer to the style of \\" She will be loved\\".  <br />It's a great 2nd album!  <br /> <br />
009917961X|5.0|John Grisham is one of the best authors of this era and this book is proof to that fact.  He is very good at devolping characters and plots without the need to use reaccuring characters.  The story is a perfect balance of a believable story and a thrilling legal battle.  Recommended to any Grisham reader, and if you haven't read a Grisham novel then this is a perfect book to start with (along with The Firm and A Time to Kill).  Enjoy
B00027JYLC|5.0|The Freaks in this movie were not the only things freaky in this movie.  One of the funnier scenes in this movie was the party where the Freaks began to chant, \\"Gooble Gobble Gooble Gobble WE Accept Her We Accept Her One of Us One of Us!\\".  How wild and inventive this was.  The Freaks in this movie were some unusual people to be sure but they had good hearts.  the acting was wooden I suspect but to me it just added to the realness of the movie.<br /><br />Freaks was a movie about basic good and evil.  Freaks showed that those the world considered most different held the same basic humane values most of us hold dear.  Yes the unique folk in the movie were different but but they were more humane and honorable than the strong man and trappese artist.<br /><br />I love this Freaks Movie because, being autistic I like people who are different.  I like that this Freaks movie has a very positive message while being lots of fun to watch.  I wished we had the complete original version.  I pray somewhere a complete original copy with its original shiocking ending is found.  My research tells me in the original ending of Freaks the Strong man was condemned to a life as a high pitched sapprano as a result of injury to his, \\"pride\\".  The lady trapeese artist became a odd ball freak in the form of half Duck half lady.<br /><br />Enjoy this movie there is plenty of meaning and laughs in the plot.

B000063DHL|5.0|Iron Maiden at its peak moment. After their double live album Live after Death (World Slavery tour) Maiden  took a slight change and used some synth sounds keeping their strong but melodic guitars work and solid bass guitar, where Steve Harris shows again who's Maiden's more influential element. Many epic songs at the Maiden's style concluded with \\"Alexander the Great\\" an instant classic when the album first appeared.<br /><br />These is one of the most solid Maiden works, a classic Maiden fan must to have album. Sadly this disc also marks the end of the Maiden Golden Era, no more Piece of Mind, Number of the Beast, Killers and Power Slave quality works appeared again.
B00003CXBK|5.0|It's an allegory about the moment when Humankind stopped living with the Natural and Spirit worlds, and sought to master them.  Man's need for Nature, BTW, was also a major theme of Miyazaki Hayao's earlier classic \\"My Neighbor Tottoro\\".  The English dub is okay, but do yourself a favor and listen to the Japanese Audio with the subtitles \\"on\\".  Don't be put off by the \\"Anime\\" tag.  This isn't about transforming superheroes or kiddy card games.  It's a heart-felt epic, and you'll forget you're watching animation within a few minutes of hitting \\"play\\".  If at least one Miyazaki film isn't on your list of \\"Best Movies-Ever\\", then truly you are missing out.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|The Arcade Fire is a unique band in and of itself.  For them to have found fame and popularity among the masses, is impressive, and proven to be deserving with this newest CD.  The first time you listen to the songs you hear the music, which wraps itself around you.  'Intervention' still gives me chills.  But eventually you start to realize that lyrically the album is amazing as well.  They don't have typical lyrics, but this is not your typical band.  There seems to be something very intellectual about listening to them. I first started listening to them in my car, and quickly moved the CD to work where I could listen to the songs using headphones.  That is when you can really appreciate this album.  It's a full sound and entirely pleasing to listen too.  I believe most people could find some enjoyment in this CD, even if they don't quite understand what they are experiencing.  But the people who contemplate music, whose lives are continually enhanced by it- those are the people who will really enjoy this album.
B000005RU2|5.0|This is the famous line-up of Mark 2; Ian Gillan on vocals, Ritchie Blackmore on guitars, Roger Glover on bass, Jon Lord on keyboards and Ian Paice on the drums. <br /> <br />This is absolutely one of the best recorded live albums for me. Recorded live in Japan in 1972! Just buy the album and listen! If you own it in vinyl (LP) like me, it's better that you own it also in the form of a CD coz it's expanded with extra tracks like Black Night, Speed King and Lucille. These songs didn't appear in the first release of the album and even in the first release of the CD. <br /> <br />This is my third copy of this album already. I've got my first copy in the mid 70s and again in the 80s. Actually in the Philippines it was released as Made in Japan Volume 1 and Volume 2 in separate album. <br /> <br />All songs in the LP Volume 1 and 2 are in one CD only in this edition and the other CD contains the extra tracks from the same Japanese tour in 1972. <br />
B000EXDS5M|5.0|Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a modern western. It is more exciting and has more action than the typical slow western. Paul Newman and Robert Redford are an excellent duo. A great story with an even greater cast.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Boston is one of the best-selling albums of all time! Bands these days just don't come-up anymore with excellent album like this! This is the first album of Boston and it's their best album ever! All songs are excellent like; Rock N Roll Band, More Than A Feeling, Piece Of Mind, Foreplay-Long Time and so on. <br /> <br />Excellent vocals by the late Brad Delp, nice guitar licks by Tom Scholz (also keyboards), also on guitar is Barry Goudreau, Sib Hashian on drums and Fran Sheehan on the bass.  <br /> <br />Again if you're collecting great rock albums, this is one you shouldn't miss!  It's a collector must! This is my second copy of the album already. <br />

No purpose in this product other than a concert tour tie in and you can purchase this along with tickets to her show currently running.  I saw her this week in Albuquerque along with my teenage daughter whom kept me grounded when she said she was just 'plain vanilla'...and why does she change costumes so often when they each look the same?  AND can you tell me why her concert tee shirts are $35 and $45??? This CD is only for beginners, training wheels not necessary.
0743219619|5.0|This book begins in a gloomy mood and in a setting that seems hardly designed to hold a reader's attention: a nursing home. But the writing is so good that I stuck with it, and it all comes to a thrilling finale. Then I did something I rarely do: reread the book. This time I was completely bowled over by the quality of the writing. This is one of the most perfectly crafted books I have ever read. As such, I would rate it with such works as The Great Gatsby, Jude the Obscure, and Appointment in Samarra. What a surprise from a mystery novel.
0156907399|5.0|An extraordinary book, at once light as air and dense with meaning. From the smallest happenings (a family gathered at a seaside house) seen in two brief glimpses (a long summer afternoon before the first world war, and a single morning ten years later), Virginia Woolf distils a profound meditation on love and loss, hope and disappointment, and human relationships, especially the precarious and limiting balance between men and women. But it is impossible to summarize in a sentence what Woolf achieves in two hundred pages, so let me just pick on three specifics: art, thought, and time.<br /><br />ART. The Harcourt Harvest Book paperback edition has a beautiful cover, apparently a tinted turn-of-the century photograph of a beach with the sea and a lighthouse beyond. It is a perfect evocation of the period and of lazy summers by the sea. Yet the credits say it is adapted from a photo by a much later artist, Herbert List; presumably the period air and the uncanny overtones of Seurat's \\"Grande Jatte\\" are the work of the designer, Liz Demeter. I mention this partly because a book's cover is like incidental music; it creates the context in which you start reading, and this is perfect. But also because visual art also plays an important part in the book. One of the guests of the owners of the house, the Ramsays, is Lily Briscoe, an unmarried woman in her thirties. We first see her as she is painting in the garden: \\"Lily's picture! Mrs. Ramsay smiled. With her little Chinese eyes and her puckered-up face, she would never marry; one could not take her painting very seriously.\\" So of course we take her for a mere amateur; and Lily similarly puts herself down, conditioned by a climate which denied creativity to women except as wives and mothers. But when we get to look closer at Lily's picture we see that it is extremely advanced for its time, and her thought processes are as rigorous as anything we hear from the paterfamilias Mr. Ramsay, a once-celebrated philosopher. Indeed in the glorious closing chapters of the book, it is Lily, struggling to express balance and feeling in paint, who comes closest to giving meaning and permanency to the whole family history. One recalls that one of Virginia Woolf's closest friends in the Bloomsbury Group was the art critic Roger Fry, who coined the term post-impressionism. Lily, far from being a minor character, stands as the alter ego of Woolf herself, achieving in touches of paint a very close analogy to what the author manages so marvelously in words.<br /><br />THOUGHT. But fine as Virginia Woolf's visual descriptions are, her main medium is not sight but thought. The two days at the seaside are described entirely through the minds of various individual members of the family and their guests. There is occasional dialogue, but no third-person narrator. A paragraph may start with the thoughts of one person about another, switch smoothly to the mind of that other person, and then return to the first again. And often the thoughts of the first character will change significantly between one moment and the next. Affection can switch suddenly to anger and back again; Woolf knows that most emotions, especially given the complex ties that bind families, can seldom be contained by a single label; through her apparent contradictions, she builds up a truth that is richer than could have been attained by consistency alone. Again, I think of the visual arts and the multiple viewpoints of cubism, but though a modern writer, Woolf is not a modern-ist; her technique is concealed, not flaunted; she is not a \\"difficult\\" writer in the sense that Joyce or even Faulkner are. As a results, her portraits come through with great warmth, especially that of Mrs. Ramsay, willingly adopting a supporting role to her curmudgeonly husband (or almost willingly -- with Woolf that is important), but blessed with a radiance of personality that illuminates the entire book, even when she is not at the center of it.<br /><br />TIME. Most novels tell a story that unfolds gradually over the course of time; this doesn't. The outer sections of the book take place virtually in real time; the action happens at about the same speed as it takes to read about it. But for all intents and purposes, these sections are static compared to the ten-year duration of the narrative as a whole. Only one thing happens in either of the outer sections that could really be called an event, and that involves two minor characters whose relationship to the Ramsays is never clearly specified. But that does not mean lack of movement. The rapidly shifting juxtapositions and viewpoints build up a dense texture of relationships and feelings that reach a certain stability at the close of the first (and longest) section, but leave you wanting more. In painting terms again, one might call this opening a still life -- except that the various figures in it are now linked by quasi-electrical charges, so that the balance between them is not static but dynamic, presently in equilibrium but capable of further motion. In effect, you could close the book at this moment and write your own narrative. Instead, Virginia Woolf does something quite extraordinary. In the ten short chapters of the twenty-page interlude entitled \\"Time Passes,\\" she takes on the role of narrator for the first time, and tells what happens in the next few minutes, the remainder of that night, the ensuing nights, the changing seasons, the course of the War, and the passage of years. She writes of impersonal things -- the house, the garden, the wind, the sea -- throwing in small nuggets of personal information almost as afterthoughts. When the Ramsays finally return, much has changed, and the former golden days seem tarnished. But by the end of this marvelous novel, Virginia Woolf has burnished them to a new shine, less brilliant perhaps, but deeper and more lasting.hat unfolds gradually over the course of time; this doesn't.

0618680004|5.0|It's a great book. In depth and not narrow minded, yet never swaying from his point of view. I think everyone, religious or not to read this book. It does not harm or hurt anyone, but tries to come to a positive conclusion.
B000O76T86|1.0|I had posted a review a few weeks ago on here upon learning about this release having a DTS audio track. I was thrilled to finally be able to watch this movie with the best sound available.     But to my dismay, the info was incorrect. There is no DTS audio track on this version. It's the same old version we've seen available a half dozen dips before. Fox needs to release this this with a DTS track and Amazon needs to keep their info correct and up to date.

B0000CABBW|5.0|Keisha Castle-Hughes shines in the role of a lifetime. She plays a Maori girl whose mother died in childbirth, and her father, in his grief, abandons the child to be raised by her grandparents. Her grandfather, at first, rejects her bitterly as he wanted a boy who could carry on the tribal traditions. Although he in time warms to the child, he repeatedly berates and humilates her when she shows independence, promise, and inventiveness. Her father returns for her to take her to live with him and his new wife, but the sea calls to her and she cannot leave her homeland, her traditions, and her destiny. As she returns, her grandfather is working hard to recruit an island boy who might lead the community in the old ways. Like many of us he does not suspect, or see, the treasure right in front of him. It is a story of tenacity, and irrepressible spirit. It is a story of family love, and one that is not soon forgotten.

B0007Y89ZM|5.0|Enough people have reviewed about the album and hence I will stick to the quality of sound. I brought this DVD as a reference DVD for my music setup comprising of Klipsch speakers, HK 635 amp linked using Monster THX cables/inter-connects mostly brought from Amazon. The quality of music listening to the DTS is amazing and really make you proud about your investment on hardware. As is being reviewed by hifi buffs, I almost started listening to each and every instruments separately and this is where the danger starts. Music is supposed to be listened to as one, when you have more and more expensive music systems, you will end up listening to some un-heard sound,  missing the song. There  should be a limit to the \\"separateness\\" needed for people  who loves Music and I think I have almost crossed that limit with my set up.
B0007OY2P8|1.0|I love this book and all Jane Austen books but this movie is dreadful! I thought the acting was not very good and couldn't connect with any of the characters.

B000J4QWMC|1.0|The theatrical version of \\"Miami Vice\\" was a huge disappointment. It lacks a coherent plot, and like its TV counterpart, it's all style (or wants to be) and very little substance. About the only thing going for it is the atmospheric cinematography. But with little to no plot, it's a hard one to sit through.<br /><br />The always stellar Jamie Foxx is completely wasted - he has little to do but act as back up for his hot headed partner (not a bad way to collect a multi-million dollar payout); the other detectives on the team have literally no screen time at all.<br /><br />I was expecting a lot more considering it was directed by Michael Mann. It wasn't even on par with a cheesy Jerry Bruckheimer film. I was shocked that two relatively good actors were reduced to this tripe - the acting was so stiff that Colin Farrell (who needed a shower desperately) makes Don Johnson look like a thespian.

B00005JPRT|5.0|\\"Once\\" is a real find. The story of a street musician who meets a Czech &eacute;migr&eacute; on the streets of downtown Dublin, is a believable, well-made film about love, dreams and making things happen.<br /><br />Guy (Glen Hansard, a real musician who also appeared in the film \\"The Commitments\\"), a street busker who sings his heart out on the streets of Dublin, works in his dad's vacuum repair shop. One day, a young lady (Marketa Irglova), a Czech immigrant, begins to ask him questions about his music, his passions, the inspiration for his ballads. They form a friendship and she encourages him to follow his dream and put together a demo album. As the friendship grows, she helps him negotiate a recording studio and practice the songs. In the process, she invites him into her home, to meet her mother and young daughter. During the course of their relationship, they grow closer, but she is still married and can't let anything happen. They round up some other musicians and begin to work on the demo, to help him with his dream.<br /><br />\\"Once\\", written and directed by John Carney, is a very intimate look at the relationship between these two people. A lot of handheld camera work, close shots and grungy, real locations help to give the film an incredible cinema verite look and style. The camera work is handheld, but not overly shaky, creating shots with an intimate, close appearance, really thrusting us into the middle of the action.<br /><br />The relationship between Guy and Girl (as they are listed in the credits) is really an interesting one that draws you into their lives. Initially, the guy is a bit put off by the girl, she is extremely chatty and forthcoming, asking him a lot of questions about his music, why he sings certain songs, the inspiration, etc. As a street musician, he is naturally a little weary about people getting too close, he simply wants them to enjoy a little of the music and drop a couple of coins or bills into his guitar case and leave. So, the young woman who stops to ask questions, in her accented English, is a minor annoyance, until he realizes she is genuinely interested.<br /><br />As their relationship grows, he feels a fondness for her, and as a single man, he naturally flirts with her. But when she realizes this is going too far, she gives him a little look, a minor reprimand, and he realizes she is right. They are friends, sharing an experience. And she is married, even if her husband still lives in the Czech Republic and they are having problems.<br /><br />As they become friends, they become involved in each other's lives. He meets her mother and daughter, sees where she lives, has dinner at their house. She meets his dad and becomes involved in his making of a demo album.<br /><br />When the duo shows up at the recording studio, with their fellow street musicians, the sound engineer greets them, but secretly reveals his true feelings to someone on his cell phone. He has a feeling this group is another example of people with too much ambition and not enough talent; they don't even know the technical details of recording the music. But when they start playing, he recognizes they have talent, the songs are good, and the lead singer, our guy, is quite good, so he becomes engrossed in making the demo as good as possible. He becomes a part of their team, investing part of himself in the production of the demo.<br /><br />Part of the beauty of \\"Once\\" is that nothing seems forced. They don't have sex, simply to make the story more dramatic. In fact, the course of their relationship seems all the more real because they simply remain friends, close friends invested in each other's lives and livelihood. There aren't any manufactured crises involving her mother and baby or his dad. They simply struggle with real life.<br /><br />Also, the music is quite good throughout the film. Guy sings a song, a love ballad he wrote for his girlfriend who moved away to London, a few times, each time making it a little better. Finally, when they record it for the demo, it is as good as it could be, with the girl playing keyboard and singing backup and the addition of the other musicians they have recruited.<br /><br />\\"Once\\" is a film about the guy following his dream. He wants to make a demo and travel to London, to try to get a contract. But perhaps more importantly, he wants to reunite with his girlfriend.

B000HCPU0Q|4.0|Not to be confused with the one-disc, 18 track collection \\"The Singles,\\" this is a box set that collects the Clash's UK singles on 19 individual discs that are designed to look like black vinyl.  Since it includes not just the original B-sides of the vinyl singles, but also alternate B-sides from releases in different markets, the total length and track listing is quite considerable, 67 tracks total.  Since the ordering follows the UK singles releases, not the US ones, there are a few oddities that may seem a bit humorous.  For example, \\"Train in Vain,\\" one of the biggest US hits, is included here only as an alternate B-side to the \\"Bankrobber\\" single. <br /> <br />I shouldn't need to tell serious Clash fans that this set has a lot of fine material.  Still, I should say that for anyone who is just looking for a career-retrospective of the Clash, you might find the CLASH ON BROADWAY box set, or even THE ESSENTIAL CLASH more user-friendly than the 19 disc format here.  The real audience for this set is the Clash completist, who really wants to have the total recorded works of the Clash on CD.  <br /> <br />It is true of course that some of the tracks are available elsewhere, and certain tracks may appear on as many as five other discs.  Collectors can expect some duplication.  Still, it is not true, as an earlier posting implied, that all of this is available elsewhere.  I have tried to compile a list of what is distinctive about this set. <br /> <br />(1) The \\"Capital Radio EP\\" was a free vinyl giveaway distributed by New Musical Express magazine.  It included an interview conducted by Tony Parsons on a moving train.  A few minutes of this was included on the STORY OF THE CLASH compilation, but not the two part, 12 minute version included here.  The instrumental \\"Listen\\" plays through part of the interview, but to hear it without the talk, you have to get SUPER BLACK MARKET CLASH. <br /> <br />(2) The live version of \\"London's Burning\\" from the \\"Remote Control\\" single was once released on CD on a disc called 1977 REVISITED: CRUCIAL MUSIC, but that has been out of print for years, so it is only currently available here. <br /> <br />(3) This set includes a pair of \\"dub\\" remixes of \\"Armagideon Time, \\"Justice Tonight\\" (running time: 4:09) and \\"Kick it Over\\" (4:44),  presented as two separate tracks from different single releases.  That is a little different from the combined \\"Justice Tonight/Kick it Over\\" track on SUPER BLACK MARKET CLASH (8: 53) and even more different from the earlier 7:00 version of \\"Justice Tonight/Kick it Over\\" on BLACK MARKET CLASH. <br /> <br />(4) \\"Rockers Galore...UK Tour\\" is a reworking of \\"Bankrobber\\" with Mikey Dread singing new lyrics about touring with the Clash.  This is not the same track as \\"Robber Dub\\" on SUPER BLACK MARKET CLASH, which lacks the Dread vocal and lyrics. <br /> <br />(5) \\"Radio One\\" from the \\"Hitsville UK\\" single is a fun Mikey Dread composition with Dread on vocals.  The lyrics complain about the lack of reggae music on the BBC. <br /> <br />(6) This set has two single re-edits of \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" from the 7\\" single (3:39) and the 12\\" single (4:30).  Both of these are shorter than the version on the SANDINISTA album (5:29).  The longer 12\\" version is available on the single-disc THE SINGLES CD, but the 7\\" version is only available on CD here. <br /> <br />(7) There are also two versions of the instrumental \\"The Magnificent Dance\\" from the 7\\" (3:35) and 12\\" (5:36) singles.  The longer version is on SUPER BLACK MARKET CLASH, but the shorter one is only available on CD here. <br /> <br />(8) \\"Outside Broadcast\\" is a jaw-dropping variation of \\"This is Radio Clash\\" with mostly different lyrics that reference everything from \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\" to \\"Lord of the Dance.\\"  Truly unique and a highlight of this set. <br /> <br />(9) \\"Radio 5\\" is a dub remix of \\"This is Radio Clash\\" with lots of rap style record scratching.  It is more conventional than \\"Outside Broadcast,\\" but worth a listen. <br /> <br />(10) \\"Long Time Jerk\\" from the \\"Rock the Casbah\\" single runs 5:08, almost twice as long as the version on SUPER BLACK MARKET CLASH (2:57). <br /> <br />(11) \\"Inoculated City\\" from the \\"Should I Stay or Should I Go Single\\" incorporates a radio commercial about toilets into the middle of the song.  Either this is the original radio commercial that the \\"Flushco\\" company sued to have removed from the US release, or it is a substitute commercial that was only on the UK single.  Either way, it adds a more satiric tone to the song than is found on the version on the US release of COMBAT ROCK <br /> <br />(12) \\"Straight to Hell\\" appears here in its short single version, running only 3:51.  That is shorter than the version that appears on COMBAT ROCK (5:33) and the still longer version on CLASH ON BROADWAY (6: 50).  I am not sure longer is better. I rather like the shortest version. <br /> <br />(13) and (14) The 12\\" single of \\"This is England\\" included two tracks that are only available on CD here, \\"Do it Now\\" and \\"Sex Mad Roar.\\"  I think these are better than several of the tracks that did appear on the CUT THE CRAP album. <br /> <br />Obviously, some of the above are only slight variations of familiar tracks, but there are also interesting rarities like \\"Outside Broadcast\\" and \\"Sex Mad Roar.\\"  The set goes a long way toward making all the previously uncollected Clash tracks available, though there are still a few exceptions.  Around the time of the STORY OF THE CLASH release, the Clash put out a CD-single called \\"Back to Brixton\\" that contained three remixes of \\"The Guns of Brixton\\" that are not included here.  Also, the discography of CLASH ON BROADWAY lists a B-Side called \\"Radio 6.\\"  If that is not a misprint for \\"Radio 5,\\" then it is missing here. <br />
B00005OCMR|4.0|You have to understand, I was about 12 years old when this first came out in theatres and I've already had a personal computer for a few years by then (got my first Atari 400 in 1980) and was definitely a computer geek, even then.  To see this movie back then was almost beyond words, as it fired my imagination more than just about anything else had before or after.  It was a great time - videogames were taking off,  computers were taking off, and there was just a feeling in the air that anything could happen.  This film was a perfect example of people taking these feelings to their extreme and no other movie takes me back to that era (except for maybe Wargames) better than Tron does. <br /> <br />Back then, a lot of people actually felt threatened by computers and this film did little to help that notion.  Viewing Tron today, it may be hard for the younger set to see what the big deal was, but in 1982, this was probably just as mind-boggling to audiences as 2001 was when it came out in '68.  I still remember being absolutely floored after seeing this the first  time on the big screen...you have to remember, back in '82, there really WAS no CGI and the best graphics resolution on the best home PC or arcade game was not even as good as the original Gameboy.  This movie pulled out all the stops and really showed the world what could be done with computer graphics and I feel that it was HUGELY influential in the development of CGI in the years to come. <br /> <br />Ok, the plot is kind of lame and there are a few lines in the script which are cringe-inducing when heard today (eg. \\"C'mon you SCSI data, be in there\\"), but I can forgive the writers for dropping a few buzzwords in the script, even if they didn't quite know what they meant.  The acting is great - Jeff Bridges completely sells the movie and is solid, as usual, and David Warner is fantastic as Sark.  Bruce Boxleitner was definitely cast against type but also did a great job and Cindy Morgan nailed her character as well.  Barnard Hughes played his usual father-figure role to great effect as well. <br /> <br />After the lackluster original non-anamorphic DVD which was plagued by line noise, Disney has finally done right by Tron with this double-disc set.  The Anamorphic picture looks about as good as possible and the colors really pop.  The faces on the characters are a bit grainy due to the process used to make the film, but it's not a problem.  The sound has been remixed to 5.1 (unlike the 4.0 of the previous release) but to my ears, for some reason the original DVD has much deeper bass - I'm not quite sure why.  On the original DVD, the recognizers absolutely THUNDER, on this DVD, the effect is diminished somewhat. <br /> <br />There are also a ton of extras, the best of which is an absolutely incredible 88-minute making-of documentary which was obviously lovingly prepared and is almost as good as the film itself. <br /> <br />When you discover the actual work it took to create this movie, you realize that it was WAY ahead of it's time.  And as I said, if you ever have a chance to see this on the big screen, jump at it.

6304119046|5.0|Orson Welles' film debut is nothing less than a masterstroke of pure genius. A modern \\"Tragicall Historie Of Dr. Faustus\\" (written by Christopher Marlowe; the play, NOT THE MOVIE), this deeply sentimental portrait of lost love is remarkable not only for its thematic elements, but for the camerawork (considered revolutionary in 1941; expertly shot by Gregg Toland, who had worked on the successful \\"Wuthering Heights\\" two years earlier). This film deserves to be seen not just by film students, but by everyone. What a shame that this film was not a box-office hit upon its initial release in 1941. The only movie over which Orson Welles had complete creative control (he was subjected to his films being severely re-edited and reshot, most notably \\"The Magnificent Ambersons,\\"<br /><br />\\"Macbeth,\\" \\"Othello, Moor Of Venice\\" and \\"Touch Of Evil,\\" among others, for the remainder of his career), this film remains his best. Not Rated.

When I popped in The Matrix for the first time and watched it at night I was completely blown away. This movie is [..]and not once could I find anything wrong with it. Sometimes I will get bothered by the poor transfer, see Alpha Dog where the scenes are at night, there is sooooo much disturbance it is almost unwatchable. If you have an HDTV and an HD DVD player and you enjoy the Matrix Experience I strongly recommend owning this collection. I am sure the movies will be released individually sometime down the road, but for me I loved all the movies. Please disregard the reviews that are rated 1 star because that reviewer only wanted the first movie, or that it does not look any better than SD. The good thing about these flipper discs is you can see for yourself and believe me this is the best looking HD transfer I have seen yet. Absolutely amazing.
B00005JPG1|4.0|Another sprawling comedy about a man who goes mad? May as well corner the market in something. However, the introduction of levity in the midst of a brutal murder scene, while matching the tone later to emerge in the film, appears at that point to be incongruous and queasy. It may be historically accurate, but as director you can choose what to emphasise. It just made me think too much of Brad and Janet of \\"Rocky Horror\\" fame. Aside from that, it was a wonderful film. Although marginally shorter than the average Tarkovsky, it mostly zips by. <br /> <br />I do find that Fincher's films don't tend to stand up to many repeat viewings and I've drawn a blank as to why. Maybe an element missing or the fact they tend to resolve around working through a puzzle and once that's solved, there's not enough else to them. Remains to be seen if that's the case with \\"Zodiac\\", but you MUST see it in the theatre for its truly stunning photographic job. And no better time to fall in love with Chloë Sevigny.
B000NA28IE|4.0|I found a number of parallels between this film and the Star Wars saga. I was not dismayed at these parallels, but found how these are storytelling elements that were not invented by George Lucas, but rather draw on much older literature and legend.<br /><br />  I have read the book prior to seeing the film in a theater, and although I recognized shortcuts taken with the plot and characters, the part that attracted me the most - the relationship of a human and a dragon - is the best I've seen portrayed since [[ASIN:0783225814 Dragonheart - Collector's Edition]]
B00003CXCT|1.0|After reading these reviews I will wait until the old version is on DVD I do not want to own this NEW version, thanks for your reviews I'll wait, patiently until Mr. Lucas decides now is the time, until then I'll stick around & save my money.
1594200823|5.0|I was extremely pleased with Michael Pollan's book. <br />I was expecting the book to be slanted towards organic foods or vegetarians, but found the book to be extremely balanced, with a \\"tell it like it is\\" approach to the various topics he covered. <br />I also learned a lot about what it takes to process and transport food.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This version of the film is absolutely nothing less than superb.  It's beautifully acted, directed, produced and edited, and most importantly, it's true to Austen's original novel.  So much so, that a great deal of the original dialogue is retained.  Jane herself would have been proud to see her masterpiece brought to the masses so wonderfully!
B00005JPLU|5.0|This movie is one of the most perfect adaptations of a graphic novel put to film ever produced.  I recommend anyone who is interested in a great movie to see this.  It is on my top 5 list of all time greatest movies made.!

B00006G8G1|5.0|1. The Wicker Man: Excellent way to start off a concert, with brlliant light effects. 5/5 <br /> <br />2. Ghost of the Navigator: Probably Steve's highlight, and a good job he did too. 5/5 <br /> <br />3. Brave New World: Starts off excellent, and the first verse is even better. However Bruce made a slight mistake in the second verse. 4/5 <br /> <br />4. Wrathchild: My favourite headbanger. Awesome, and the crowd are brilliant. 6/5 <br /> <br />5. 2 Minutes to midnight: My second favourite on here, particularly the intro and chorus are brilliant. Verses are also more than excellent, and the song just couldt have been made better. 8/5 <br /> <br />6. Blood Brothers: Never really has been a great favourite, but it wasn't a bad attempt. 4/5 <br /> <br />7. Sign of the Cross: Vastly underrated by Maiden, and should have stayed a classic. Awesome performance, even the really long instrumental bit is done well. 6/5 <br /> <br />8. The Mercenary: A classic live, and probably wont ever be this good again. The best for stunts, this is one of the fastest songs they ever wrote. 5/5 <br /> <br />9. The Trooper: Not one of the best, but still awesome. Bruce waves the Britain flag while he isnt singing. 5/5 <br /> <br />10. Dream of Mirrors: The worst song on the DVD, but still not bad. 3.5/5 <br /> <br />11. The Clansman: The audience are brilliant in this song, and the freedom cry is one of the best things on the DVD. 5/5 <br /> <br />12. The Evil that Men Do: You wont be disappointed by this. Best bit is when Janick Gers fights Eddie with his guitar, and at the end of the song Eddie walks away. 6/5 <br /> <br />13. Fear of the Dark: Awesome live, as always. A lot of the song Bruce doesn't even need to sing, because the audience do it for him. Even that doesn't make the song worse. 6/5 <br /> <br />Now we near the end... <br /> <br />14. Iron Maiden: Guitaring is very unusual because the band do someting to totally change the style. At the end, Bruce goes inside an Iron Maiden,and then he reappears just before the next song. 6/5 <br /> <br />15. The Number of the Beast: My classic favourite, but i love this version lots. Bruce does sound a bit weak on the vocals, but it puts effect to make the song better. Nothing better than this! 12/5 <br /> <br />16. Hallowed be Thy Name: Excellent vocals and guitaring, sand thats all i have to say. 5/5 <br /> <br />17. Sanctuary: I dont see the point in giving this less just because of the audience. The audience didn't manage to get into this at all, but the band performed it well. 5/5 <br /> <br />18. Run to the hills: An all-time classic which remained famous for 25 years, and will probably still be famous when im dead (im 13). An excellent way to end a concert, and all the band members perform it well. Nicko McBrain even plays the drums without the heads. Up the Irons!!!!!!!!!! 6.5/5 <br /> <br />Best bit: The fight with the troll in \\"The Evil that Men Do\\" <br /> <br />Worst bit: The pause between \\"Iron Maiden\\" and \\"The Number of the Beast\\" is unnecessarily long, but at least they play my favourite song afterwards. <br /> <br />Average rating: 5.722222222
0694003611|5.0|I know this book by heart.  I read it countless times to our son and daughter and then I read it to our grandkids.  They all love it.  The DVD, \\"Good Night Moon\\" is even better.  Buy it if you get the chance.
B000000YG5|5.0|This is one of the best ever Jazz albums, recorded by one of the top five tenor players in Jazz history.<br /><br />The other musicians are:<br /><br />Tommy Flanagan - Piano<br /><br />Doug Watkins - Bass<br /><br />Max Roach - drums<br /><br />Even if you're not a Jazz fan you'll know Sonny Rollins 'St Thomas' which opens the album, with its calypso melody its one of the best known Jazz tunes. The performances are uniformly excellent and the sound is incredible since this album was recorded 50 years ago.<br /><br />The track 'Moritat' is in fact 'The theme from the three penny opera', but it sounds remarkably similar to 'Mack the Knife'. Whatever the tune really is, Rollins is never less throughly inventive, as anyone who has seen him live will testify to. This track perhaps contains the highlight of the album, where Sonny Rollins trades 4's with Max Roach.<br /><br />This is one of the classic Jazz albums and should be in everyones collection.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|Linkin Park's latest album is too much of a departure from previous albums. They've gotten soft and moved to far away from what brought them to the dance. Very disapointed as this is one of my three favorite bands that up until this time have always delivered. Maybe next time.<br /><br />-Mark
0743298020|5.0|Couldn't put the book down.  I found myself forming a relationship with these chacters and I cared about them and the path that their lives would take. There really aren't any books that I would say that I would pick up and read again, but I would indeed read this one again!  This book would make a wonderful movie.
B000P2A256|4.0|These guys are moving in the right direction. This album is very heavily produced and I like the sound. Reminds me of the great albums by Prince and Michael Jackson at times. This type of music where great songwriting and heavy production meet to make cool songs is rare now but this album is almost there. Songs like \\"If I never see your face again\\" and \\"Makes me wonder\\" and \\"Can't Stop\\" and \\"Kiwi\\" are pure pop heaven with killer hooks all round. Overall I think this is a good album with some killer tracks reminiscent of the golden era of pop music when Michael Jackson and Prince were pushing eachother to produce the best music possible. Fans of their previous album will certainly like these grooves and new fans will dig the more professional sound being created. Hopefully they can lift it a notch for their next album and create a real classic pop album that can be mentioned in the same sentence as Prince's \\"Gold Experience\\" and Michael Jackson's \\"Dangerous\\". I think they have potential to create something that good.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Simply the best album of the XX century, it was recorded in 1966 but we can hear it today and sounds very recent, just as if it was recorded last week, an album that can sound that good is really good. <br /> <br />There is no doubt on Brian Wilson's genius, this albums proves it. <br /> <br />
0066620996|5.0|\\"Good to Great\\" by Jim Collins might be one of today's best business books. It is his second book after \\"Built to Last\\" which provides some unanswered questions that arouse from his first book. It explains clearly how great companies become great. The book shows us good-to-great findings including Level 5 Leadership, the Hedgehog Concept, a Culture of Discipline, the Flywheel and the Doom Loop, and many other concepts to achieve greatness. Collins introduces a winning economic model that can help you transform a good company into a great one. Overall, this book is very worthwhile to read.
074356619X|5.0|I am astounded at all of the info that is given with a positive enforcement and backed with facts. How can a person not have their eyes opened!!!! I love the cds and will recommend them to everone that will listen. <br />Mark
B000002L75|4.0|On this album, fans get to witness Depeche Mode in a strange transition between their older sound (\\"Something To Do\\", \\"If You Want\\"), their poppy stuff (\\"People Are People\\", \\"Master & Servant\\"), and a newer, somewhat darker theme (\\"It Doesn't Matter\\", \\"Lie To Me\\") - which two years later would reach its zenith on Black Celebration.  This album also features \\"Somebody\\", one of 'schMode's more famous and beautiful songs in which Martin Gore bares his soul.  While the songs seem all over the map, they somehow still come together to form one of Depeche Mode's better records.  I think whether you're a Top-40, Just Can't Get Enough fan or a gothic, Dressed In Black fan, you'll still find something to enjoy on this CD.
B000001ELD|4.0|I think there's enough cool songs on here to outweigh the wacky ones. One thing I'll never figure out is why all 4 members decided to have female background singers on their records. More groupies I guess? Anyways, \\"Radioactive\\" is a cool Gene tune and sounded great live on the Dynasty Tour. \\"See You Tonite\\" is Gene doing a great Beatles interp., but I like it. I also like \\"Man of 1000 Faces\\" and \\"Mr. Make Believe.\\" Gene gets silly with \\"Living in Sin\\" and \\"Tunnel of Love\\" and \\"When You Wish Upon a Star.\\" But having the Kiss guys branch out and do different things is what makes these solos cool and unique. At this point, they had to write some different stuff.
B000001ELB|4.0|There are mixed feelings on this album for me. First off, the packaging is so cool, if you were lucky enough to get the LP from the 70's it came with cool inserts like a platinum award. The cover is awesome. I actually like the remixes and freshening up of the songs, my only problem is the songlist. It weighs so heavily on the earlier albums. I feel that it should spread the wealth more across all their releases up to this point. \\"Shock Me\\" and \\"Rocket Ride\\" should be on there as should \\"Christine Sixteen\\" and \\"King of the Night Time World\\". Having said that, it's still a great compilation and it will always be popular because it's famous for being the first KISS greatest hits package 1974-1978. <br />
B000001ELF|5.0|This album to me is as essential to Classic Kiss as \\"Destroyer\\". It's THAT good. The solo albums vary in style, but this one has a rip roaring classic Kiss vibe to it, and it even goes places that Kiss as a group can't go...like the melodic \\"What's on Your Mind?\\" - How that wasn't a major hit I'll never know, but it still sounds like it could be released today by a new group. \\"Rip it Out\\" is timeless. Obviously \\"New York Groove\\" is awesome. But \\"Fractured Mirror\\" is like Ace's \\"Stairway to Heaven\\". Unbelievable guitar work on here, great songwriting, and Ace and Eddie Kramer obviously had a blast getting out all of these cool sounds. I know many say that KISS should have never done the solo albums...but then we would never have this classic record.
B000001ELL|5.0|I love this album. I don't care what others may say. Look, Kiss was experimenting and they went for it on this one. There's no denying \\"I Was Made for Lovin You\\". Yes, it's rock and bit mired in disco, but it still rocks. ALL of the Ace tunes are awesome especially \\"2000 Man\\", but I love \\"Hard Times\\". If only that could have been played live. Paul's poppiness and cool melodies come through on \\"Sure Know Something\\" but I really like \\"Magic Touch\\" which rocks hardest for Paul on here. And Gene only has 2 tunes, but \\"Charisma\\" has a cool riff and beat and in content to me is similar to \\"Dr. Love\\"... I mean it's a silly sex song. \\"X-Ray Eyes\\" is okay. Sadly, this contains Peter's last Kiss song that he both sings and writes on and it's cool. \\"Dirty Livin'\\" turned out to be autobiographical for Peter. I love the whole Dynasty period. The costumes were over the top, I love the setlist on the tour, and this record offered a new fresh, rockin sound for Kiss. Here's another tid bit...I wish they would have recorded Alive 3 at this point. It could have been a mix of solo stuff, Dynasty stuff, and other tunes that didn't make it on the first 2 live records. Oh well.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I am mainly writing this out of disgust for the stupidity of some people. This is an excellent program with some of the best HD visuals you will see currently on the market.  For those of you stupid enough to not understand that you must have an HD player to play an HD DVD...well... go back to your caves and get a clue!  It has noting to do with the show so why would you give an excellent program a bad review because you are to stupid to buy the right format...hey I got a bunch of VHS tapes if you wanna try those on your DVD player...
0393327655|4.0|This is my second book on atheism (first was Sam's \\"Letter to a Christian nation\\").  As a newly de-converted I found this book interesting and thought provoking. Perhaps because I am new to atheism, I do not agree with Sam's insistent that Religion is completely bad and that it has nothing to offer society.  I still hold out hope that liberal christianity, jewdaism, etc can be of use to society.    <br /> <br />This book gives one many things to think about.  As a somewhat liberal person I've always tried to be \\"politically correct\\" and this book has made me re-evaluate that thinking.  If something is wrong its wrong.  why do we not say so?  I think even conservative Christians would agree that Islam is not good for society.  Why do people constantly stand up for it and say its really a peaceful religion?  It is not a peaceful religion.  That is not to say that most Muslims are peaceful people, but that seems to be despite there faith, not because of it.   <br /> <br />This book is definitely worth a read. In fact I plan on re-reading it in a few months.   <br /> <br />And Since Bruce Bain will undoubtedly spam this post as he has done all others:  Your posts are garbage, they make no sense.  The Constitution has nothing to do with the discussion of Atheism.  If you really want to debate this issue, why not put up a real argument?
0143038419|4.0|Our heroine is a little whiney/self-indulgent but humorous and engaging. An enjoyable read overall. Made me feel like traveling. I was in Bali nearly 30 years ago and it sounds like it hasn't changed much there. Good vacation book or to read on an airplane. A page turner.
0694003611|5.0|We love this book- our copy is well-read! When children are read to daily, they learn to love reading.  Perfect bedtime stories, to calm everyone down and make us ready for sweet dreams.  If you can find the LARGE size board book get it- they're fabulous keepsakes. Perfect gifts for any child, and a perfect tradition in your own home and family!
0596527055|4.0|As a full time inventor, I read this book with especial interest. There is nothing new or radical here. The essentials have been stated earlier in various books. But you can treat Berkun's text as a concise assessment of famous inventors and what possibly characterised them.<br /><br />Innovation is a precious intangible. Its yields are very unpredictable. But Berkun suggests ways that it might be cultivated. Something of interest to anyone of creative bent.<br /><br />Maybe the most cogent message is that you should strive to define a problem precisely. Where perhaps no one else sees it as a problem. Or where it is not believed possible that a solution exists. Then, try to tackle it. To some readers, this could be the most surprising section of the book. Many wonder how some inventors got their ideas. Well, sometimes, clarifying a problem starts you on the road to its elucidation.<br /><br />It echoes what the physicist Richard Feynman once said. That what distinguishes a great scientist is not so much his ability to solve a problem. Necessary but not sufficient. He also needs a talent in defining an important problem to work on. One that is amenable to solution. Feynman was speaking on science, while Berkun's examples are mostly drawn from industry. Yet the underlying idea is the same.
0805047905|5.0|What's not to love? Every child needs lots of Eric Carle books- we were able to find these basics in large size board book, and they still read them even in his kindergarten class (he has a fabulous teacher, but I presume they all utilize them!). We think kids need reading to every day from the time they're born or so- and these fun, short, colorful books keep their attention and help them learn to enjoy reading and learning!
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I have never written an online review before, but I feel pretty strongly about this.  I love Linkin Park's first two CD's.  I bought this one based on what the other CD's were like and off of their hit single \\"what ive done\\".  The rest of the CD \\"minutes to midnight\\" sound nothing like their first two CD's.  It is largly hip-hop style with very little musical complexity.  I was extremely discapointed with this release.  So, please, Listen before you buy.  <br />     I give this CD a 1 star because I did like one song.
0399226907|5.0|We love this book- and ALL of his books!! When children are read to daily, they learn to love reading.

1582701709|4.0|Book was fine as far as phsycial appearance, disappointing content, I expected a more organized book.  It was just several people having input.
B000001ELP|5.0|The problem everyone has with this is that it's not made of more \\"Shout It Out Loud\\"s or \\"Rock and Roll All Night\\"s. With the state of Kiss in 1981, I'm not so sure they could have done anything right from a commerical standpoint. They were critiqued as a kiddie band, lost a member, and accused of selling out due to Dynasty. This album - if it had been a commerical success - would be their biggest album to date. There are great melodies, hooks, riffs, drums...and the songwriting is inspirational and it goes places that Kiss never went before as far as content. \\"Just a Boy\\" \\"Under the Rose\\" \\"I\\" and \\"A World Without Heroes\\" are awesome melodic tunes. Ace's \\"Dark Light\\" and \\"Escape from the Island\\" are cool. To prove my point - in college I put this CD on for my roommate who knew almost nothing about Kiss. And he thought \\"Under the Rose\\" was one of the coolest songs he ever heard. At this point in 1981, in many eyes, Kiss could do nothing right. This is truly a musical work of art. Even Bob Ezrin has since claimed that the problem with this record is that it's too good, and too shocking because it turned out exactly the way they intended. But Kiss couldn't get away with conceptual music like The Who or the Beatles. And as far as Gene, Paul and Ace bashing this record since it came out...I don't buy it. They can't claim in hindsight that it was the wrong thing to do. They really believed in it at the time. If it had sold, they'd be playing half of these songs live.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|If he just gets better...he does. His sound is so fresh to things old and new. In a time where nothing is left to the imagination in the new pop genre, romance is in the words and from his voice. This is an excellent album. Michael Buble's previous albums are also worth having in your collection.
B000001ELR|5.0|This record kicks major major butt. I'll always remember the video for \\"I Love it Loud\\". Eric Carr's drums are unbelieveable on this record. This record still did not sell well because Kiss wasn't cool in 1982. This album has grown by legend since it came out. It will always be remembered as the last make-up album (until Psycho Circus). But all of the attention is warrented because this record IS that good. The lyrical content is somehow cooler and more serious than ever before. \\"Saint and Sinner\\", \\"War MAchine\\" - these songs sound like Kiss, but like Kiss on steroids. The title track from Paul is great...the whole thing is great. I just get depressed over it because later we found out that Ace didn't really play on it and it was to be his last record until the reunion. This will also always be one of my favorite album covers. On the Rock the Nation tour, they finally played \\"War Machine\\" again and it really rocked. I only wish they would have continued to make albums that sounded like this one in the 80s, but it wasn't to be.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I purchased this album some time ago, following having seen the dvd of the movie.  What I had really wanted was the sheet music so I could play the beautiful piano pieces as heard in the film.  It took a few months for the music to be published - Dario Marianelli is the composer - but until that time I listened to the c.d., which, I believe any lover of classical music will enjoy whether they play piano or not.  Mr. Marianelli has crafted a hybrid blend between the best of classical form in musicianship with a more modern aesthetic.  His music is cleaner, less fussy . . . and therein lies the beauty  - you can hear the melodies singing out above all else, and they are rich, lovely melodies!  Grab a cup of tea and the newspaper, or head out in the early morning dew to fuss with your garden . . . with P & P playing as your soundtrack.  Hugely satisfying!!!
B00000AF95|2.0|Okay. One of lowest rankings for the albums because: #1 - Gene's songs on here are absolutely horrible. Not one of them is good. Just awful. \\"Lonely is the Hunter\\"? \\"Burn Bit## Burn\\" \\"While the City Sleeps\\" ? I think I'll go to sleep. Gene was off making movies and he should have stayed there and let Paul have 9 songs on here. But, Paul's not off the hook either. He was going through this phase of trying to sing really high notes and it ruins otherwise great songs. \\"I've Had Enough\\" \\"Under the Gun\\" and \\"Get All You Can Take\\" would have been great if Paul had not been trying to break the windows in the studio while singing. And, God rest his soul, but Mark St. John's playing really stinks. But it probably wasn't his fault. I'm sure Gene and Paul wanted someone to play a million notes a minute as was en vogue in 1984. But, couldn't they have just stayed with their sound? This was the beginning of them losing sight of themsleves and trying to copy the flavor of the month. But thankfully \\"Heaven's on Fire\\" was such a great song, that most people forget how much the rest of the record stinks and this record went on to sell millions. That song is like a diamond in the middle of a bunch of cow poop.
0385340540|2.0|Joel Backman has been serving 6 years of a 20 year jail sentence when he is unexpectedly pardoned by the out-going US President. Backman was once a highly influential political power-broker with friends (and enemies) in the highest places. But when he became involved in trading software that had the ability to hack into another country's latest and most sophisticated defence satellite system, he had faced a choice of confession or likely assassination. He chose to confess, needless to say. Now without prior warning he has been set free, although he's being very closely tracked by the CIA (who manipulated the president for Backman's release) and, eventually, secret agents from a number of other countries.<br /><br />Choosing a new Grisham novel is rarely a difficult decision, he's a good story teller and several of his earlier works have been converted into big-budget movies. I doubt that this will be one of them however. As I progressed through the story, I became more and more interested in the story that wasn't told - the events leading up to Backman's arrest 6 years ago - and wondered if this book was actually a sequel to a previous novel which covered that storyline. I'm pretty sure it wasn't, and it made me wonder if Grisham could have created a better novel if he had told that story rather than this \\"sequel\\". It seems to me that there would have been a lot more excitement, more tension and good old entertainment than in The Broker.<br /><br />Much of the story takes place in Italy, where Backman has been forced to hide (by the CIA), and it wasn't long before I gained the impression that his culture-adaptation and learning of local history was similar to his own experiences (Grisham's) while he researched the book. I know that it was right that he should go there to better understand the ways of Italian people, but his experiences seemed to influence the story more than they need have done. And I found Grisham's stereotypes of \\"Europeans\\" very irritating, occasionally referring to them as if everyone in Europe comes from the same small village. While not exactly racist, it does nevertheless sound rather ridiculous, as we know only too well that the characteristics and attitudes of European people vary enormously, in fact in Britain alone we have a widely diverse culture. To illustrate, I quote from Chapter 12 : \\"Space is shared in Europe, not protected. Tables are shared, the air evidently is shared because smoking bothers no-one. Cars, houses, buses, apartments, cafes - so many important aspects of life are smaller, thus more cramped, thus more willingly shared. It's not offensive to go nose-to-nose with an acquaintance during routine conversation because no space is being violated. Talk with your hands, hug, embrace, even kiss at times.\\"<br /><br />Well, that may be true in Bologna, but I'm not sure it applies in Basildon. Or Birmingham, or Basingstoke, or Bolton for that matter.<br /><br />Despite this sweeping, generalistic description of us \\"Europeans\\", Grisham is keen to point out the cultural differences between those from Texas compared to those of Tenessee, the characteristics of a Canadian as opposed to an American, and why someone from Manhattan is different from someone from Memphis.<br /><br />And I'm sure that many readers of The Broker will have found, as I did, the seemingly endless translations of Italian to English more than a little irritating. We got the point after one page of it - but it went on for ages until it became like an Italian-English phrase book.<br /><br />This book could have been hugely improved by omitting the naive 'Euro-observations' (American style), cutting back on 90% of the translation, and perhaps replacing that with the untold story of the events which took place before Backman was jailed. At least half a book could have been dedicated to those past years, it could have been called 'Part One', there could then have been a 'Part Two' entitled \\"Six Years Later\\" which would have been a condensed version of the story we are actually given here. This was, in the end, frustrating for me because there's no doubt that Grisham is (was?) a very good story-teller, but on this occasion he has been rather casual, not stretching his once vivid imagination to the fullest, and failing to come up with a really gripping, entertaining story that we all know he is capable of. And I have to disagree with the opinions of one or two other reviewers here who thought the ending was fast-paced and exciting; it wasn't. Quite the opposite - I was waiting for some kind of bombshell, but then I reached the final page and I was still waiting. It just fizzled away meekly.<br /><br />It's almost as if Grisham spent an extended holiday in Italy, decided to write his memoirs of that mini-odyssey, and to make money he built a mildly interesting fictional story around it.lly given here.

1582701709|1.0|The book is premised on the law of attraction. The theory is that if you think positive thoughts that good things will come to you, and if you think negative thoughts that bad things will come to you.  In practice, the theory tells me that this book was horrible, because i was thinking it was horrible after the first 15 pages.  So it is my fault the book was bad:) <br /> <br />This book boils down to something we all have been told before...It helps to have a positive attitude in life.  If you need to be told that again and again and again, then read this book.   <br /> <br />
0316096199|5.0|Yes, like many I bought Lucky having earlier read The Lovely Bones by the same author. The earlier novel deserves its high praise, while this one is quite different - even though it tackles a similar issue. I rarely enjoy true stories, especially autobiographical ones, but this consistently held my interest through to the end. The trial in particular was actually full of tension, all the more so because we know it actually happened like that. A powerful insight into the intense trauma of cross-examination of a rape victim and why so many such cases fail to lead to conviction. Ms Sebold is clearly a strong-willed woman, an exceptional writer and I will pre-order her next work without even waiting to find out the subject matter. She's that good.
0316018953|4.0|When the Overlook arrived at my door, I was immediately discouraged by its lack of thickness.  I questioned how the text could possibly cover a full story at half the length of its predecessors.  Within the first few pages, I realized that Michael Connelly knows his audience and more importantly knows that his audience has come to know Harry Bosch.  While in previous excursions further description was required, the Overlook conveys through use of short, subtle details that immediately describe what drives Harry.  This book is not intended for a first time reader.  This text is intended for those who know Bosch well.  It is a chance for the dedicated reader to toss aside the need to understand Harry and hang on for the ride.  And what a ride it is.      The story starts with what looks to be a standard murder scene and pumps up the adrenaline as it introduces terrorism to the plot.  Convincingly, Bosch remains true to form, unwilling to hand over the case no matter the title in front of him.  If you have enjoyed getting to know Bosch over the years, you will certainly not be disappointed.
0312997221|4.0|This appealed to me simply because I have an interest in 'vengeance' storylines as opposed to revenge, and although I enjoyed it it didn't move me in particular, not emotionally at least. It was a tremendous odyssey however, winging its way from such unusual places as Vietnam to Canada to Dubai and on to Surinam - among many others. Chief among those others was Bosnia, and I have to admit I welcomed this history lesson about a series of conflicts that I never truly understood as well as I do now, thanks to Fred! Likewise the guerrilla warfare in Vietnam, even the Second World war - how superbly the author entwines fact with fiction and fills us with, if we're honest, a lot of unexpected knowledge on the way through this somewhat long-drawn-out mission of justice. Thanks to fascinating background on the central character of Cal Dexter, in particular his years as a 'tunnel rat' against the tactically superior Viet Cong army, we know that he is more than capable of carrying out the seemingly impossible task of finding and returning the Serbian war-lord to the paymaster who recruited him for his role of avenger. The tale contains more than passing associations with Al Qaeda too, and their 9/11 strikes, leaving the reader to wonder how it might have been avoided, or how Usama Bin Laden could have been found just days later. Not classic Forsyth I guess, but a mightily interesting tale nonetheless, and worth reading more than once.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|The real life story of Chris Gardner is an inspiration, those were very difficult times for most of America and we prevailed, Chris prevailed even more so than the rest of us.  Will Smith has become an excellent actor worth following and his son did a fine job on his first time out.<br /><br />I agree that this movie comes to an abrute conclusion and would have liked to seen more of his success and the success of his son, but I have a feeling that would lead to disappointment.<br /><br />My family enjoyed watching and I will probably watch it a couple more times, but don't see it as my go to movie for getting me out of a rute or inspiring me to do great things, just the things that I have to do.

0743289684|5.0|A must read - especially to every American who thinks America should embrace \\"multiculturalism\\"  by convincing themselves and others that Islam is a peaceful, non-violent religion. To those of you who think that, I dare you to read this book.<br /><br />The author writes a very graphic biography of her experiences growing up in Islamic culture and tradition. As she shows the reader:  Islam spreads a culture that is brutal, bigoted, fixated on controlling women, and harsh in war. The thought that Islam is peaceful and tolerant is a fallacy. Women must obey men because Islam requires it. Clerics rule in the Islamic culture by compete totalitarianism. By the end of the second chapter, one begins to understand Islamic culture, ideology and traditions; getting a sense that Islam is not all that it appears to be.<br /><br />Asaan Ali's book is very timely and should be a wake up call to Americans. If we continue down the road of multiculturalism and ideological tolerance of a culture/religion that encourages and is sworn to eliminate all Islamic unbelievers, we need to speak out and stop such ideology. I hope we will wake up and learn the lessons of the Netherlands and not let America make the same mistakes.<br /><br />- Gary Perman
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Corinne Bailey Rae's style is beyond words.  She somehow puts tremendous feeling and expression into her singing, and her songs are perfect for her style.  She's the best new performer/song writer, in my opinion.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|I bought this DVD for one reason only.....Pink Floyd Reunion.  I wasn't dissapointed.  I was however dissapointed in MTV for cutting out most of David Gilmour's guitar solo on Comfortably Numb.  The only part of the Floyd performance I didn't like was Roger singing on Wish you Were Here.  Dave probably should have sang everything.  The highlight of the concert was Gilmour's guitar solo on Comfortably Numb.  I haven't seen Dave play with that much emotion for a very long time and it gave me chills.  That is why he is one of the greatest guitar players of our time.  A must own for any Floyd fan.....
B00006FDCD|5.0|I can remember watching \\"It\\" as a child, and falling in love with the movie. As soon as I could, I bought it on video. When I'm bored, or there's nothing to watch on tv, I would put my tape it. After wearing it out to the point of no return, I went on the hunt for the DVD. Finding it at such a great price was a deal I couldn't refuse. I never realized how much I really destroyed my tape til I saw it on DVD. Thanx!
0786838655|5.0|My 11-year-old daughter is really enjoying this series of books. She was introduced to it by her fourth grade teacher last year. He read the first chapter of the first book aloud to his class at the end of the year. My daughter didn't pick that book up again until the spring book fair of her fifth grade year. However, once she started reading it, she hasn't been able to put it down. She's reading all the books in the series the same way. I recommend it for kids who love fantasy and adventure.
B000NVIXDW|3.0|This CD is okay compared to his previous recordings which are all excellent. This one lacks the excitement I hear in the others.
1400097029|1.0|I would give this book zero stars if I could.  The narrator is unlikeable and misogynist.  His descriptions of his adult daughter I found frankly creepy.  The prose is horribly overwritten - florid and clumsy, with unbelievably clunky dialogue.   <br /> <br />In general, if I buy a book on Amazon and don't care for it, I can't be bothered to return it; this particular book inspired me to pay the postage and send it back.  Not recommended.
B000002ITW|5.0|This eclectic group of misicians formed a band CSN&Y, and told the story's of America growing up in the 60's and 70'. It was a difficult time for this country. But David Crosby, Graham Nash, Stephen Stills, and Neil Young wrote about love & hate, the Vietnam War, the killings at Kent St., political corruption, the blight of the black community, etc. They wrote about their lives & experiences. They wrote about what mattered most. To this day, \\"4 Way Street\\" is my favorite piece of music. They wrote the songs that our children, and grand children will listen to, and ask, \\"What did that mean daddy? What happened at Kent State mommy? Why did we hate black people? Who was this man named Martin? This collection of song & stories is a must. <br />
0380713802|5.0|Having been in a few places in Europe, I can relate to what Bill Bryson is talking about. But if I had never been, I still could relate. His humour, the way he has of connecting past musings with his present surroundings is skillful and funny. I sit by myself and giggle at the way he takes a thought and stretches it like PlaDoh into a ridiculous mental play with him playing the star fool. He does not spare himself and he does not disappoint. We are entirely there with him. A wonderful read.
B000P2A256|5.0|I cant pickup on any filler songs on this record, they all seem like possible singles. It does tend to dabble into really poppy areas but somehow doesn't detract from my overall impression. After few listens many songs are stuck in your head and will not disappear. Just succumb and buy this sucka now. The ballads are all memorable and catchy and the rockers have a frenetic energy that blend rock and pop seamlessly.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Supernatural is an EXCELLENT show!   Jared and Jensen have wonderful chemistry that bring Dean and Sam to life.

0743298020|5.0|The Thirteenth Tale is a rare find and I hope that Diane Setterfield will turn into one of those rare authors who keep punching out great stories.  This book deserves to be widely read and I believe it has already found a following. This definitely makes my list of favorites for 2007.<br /><br />Setterfield proves herself a master manipulator as she gracefully twists the plot and characters in versatile ways that will keep you guessing even after you've finished the book.  How's that for magic?  If you've got it figured out ahead of time, I envy your ability of deduction.  It would appear there are many still debating the outcome of the fire.<br /><br />You'll want to pay close attention throughout the reading because this is not a flimsy work of art and it will suck you in, twist you up, and spit you out at the final climax.  The novel is rich with complex characters and a compelling plot that will haunt you long after you finish the last page.  It may start slow, but it picks up speed and barrels through the finish line.<br /><br />Perhaps the ending was a little too pat for some, but after all the other heavy lifting, it was nice to have a quiet calm conclusion.  For certain, the rest of the book will have you holding your breath, rereading passages, and wishing for more.  I know it was a sad day when I finally came to the end of the book.  And, though I loaned it out, I asked for it back so I can reread it one more time.  It's that good.  What better endorsement can one give?  It's hard to believe this is a first novel and I pray it won't be Diane's last.<br /><br />This is a finely structured story of madness and mayhem, lunacy and eccentricity, love and friendship, in the typical gothic English setting but not during the typical timeframe of most gothic novels.  Though some may not care for this type of mystery, I found it compassionate, stimulating, and thought provoking.  And though it echoed of Bronte and others, it stands on its own merits and deserves to be read for its own intrinsic worth.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, read it, share it, and cherish it.serves to be read for its own intrinsic worth. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book, read it, share it, and cherish it.  <br />
0060882611|5.0|This was one of the first \\"long\\" books that my 5 year old and I have read together, as opposed to picture story books. He absolutely loved it. Our only issue was sticking to one chapter a night, as he was always begging me to continue for just 1 more page! <br /> <br />The story is tender and realistic; a little sad in places, but good life lessons for even sensitive listeners - and a happy ending. My only very minor negative would be that in places the vocabulary and dialogue are a bit specific to time & place (American farmland), so culturally diverse young readers might need some explanation. I was easily able to substitute or explain a word here or there, and my son followed the story just fine.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|What makes the Pride and Prejudice soundtrack by Dario Marianelli the best? It's so good that you would want to heard it throughout the day, while you're driving, while in your shower, while you're cooking, while doing chores around the house, even while watching my kids play in the park. I got the CD, downloaded it in my cell phone's MP3 and off i went into my classical, magical and elegant world of Jane Austen... even in the midst of my very ultra-mordern suburban life. I love the Black-eyed Peas, Justin Timberlake and the ENglish rockbands too, but sometimes, when you want to go about the day in the Elizabeth Bennet kind of mood, this is the kind of music that puts you into character, that enables you to walk elegantly, slow down and smile charmingly at your kids and husband... this is the soundtrack of my life. <br />

006074815X|5.0|Eye of the Needle is clearly one of the best suspense novels ever written. I recently re-read it, and enjoyed it even more the second time.  <br /> <br />I read it again as part of a self-education project (which you can find by searching the web for \\"lew weinstein's novel writing blog\\"), so my comments are organized around various \\"writing topics\\" which are important to me. <br /> <br />In a technique that I used in my new legal thriller [[ASIN:1595941622 A Good Conviction]], (although I don't presume to have done it as well as Follett did), Follett employs what he calls a \\"ping-pong\\" structure, alternating between the characters, switching focus abruptly at the end of scenes, and leaving the reader in suspense for many pages before resuming the thread. <br /> <br />This structure was, according to an essay by Follett appended to the end of my copy, developed in the author's original story outline and then rigidly adhered to, and it worked splendidly, forcing him to consider the impact of each character's actions on the other, and offering ample latitude for enriched attention to character, landscape and emotion. <br /> <br />Eye of the Needle is also a historical novel, and as a writer of historical fiction myself ([[ASIN:0299187942 The Heretic (Library of American Fiction)]], my first novel, is set in 15th century Spain), I am particularly impressed with Follett's ability to write a suspenseful story despite the fact that we know D-day succeeded, and thus that Faber failed. <br /> <br />Follett draws the distinction between fact and fiction with a one page historical preface about the D-Day deception. He ends the preface ... \\"That much is history. What follows is fiction. Still and all, one suspects something like this must have happened.\\" We're immediately intrigued. <br /> <br />Follett brilliantly, and necessarily, transfers his fictional tension away from whether Faber will succeed ... to how he will be foiled. In the process, he creates a superb heroine whorises to larger-than-life status in the greatest two days of her life.  <br /> <br />In this regard, Eye of the Needle is much like Frederick Forsythe's [[ASIN:0553266306 The Day of the Jackal]], where we know that De Gaulle was not murdered by a sniper but are carried into exquisite tension anyway, again over how the also enormously competent Jackal will be stopped. <br /> <br />Follett's two main characters are complex and well developed. <br /> <br />Faber of course is the villain. But he is also patriotic (to Germany), quite competent, and even capable of feelings, which he must repress in order to carry out his mission. He is a wonderful lover, which he could not be if he were truly devoid of  feeling. This complex character must be admired even as we hate and fear him. A remarkable achievement. <br /> <br />Lucy starts out as a dominated young woman, who chooses to escape to her father-in-law's island rather than live among people. But in her virtual solitude, she develops an unexpected resolve, and when faced with the ultimate challenge, she rises to it. Is what she does believable? Maybe not, although in wartime people do extraordinary things. In any case, it doesn't matter since Follett portrays this larger-than-life character in a way that fully engages the reader's emotions as we root for her to succeed against the far stronger and better trained Faber. The final scenes and epilogue drew tears from this romantic reader, but then I'm always a sucker for melodrama. <br /> <br />Godliman (What a name! I'd love to know where Follett got it.) is the enabler of the story, providing the narrative links that show lead Faber to Lucy. But how much better to provide these through an interesting character than through narrative prose. Godliman's growth from passive professor to razor-sharp spycatcher is done a little quickly. We can believe it, but we would like to know more about him. Perhaps as the third character, he doesn't warrant more attention. <br /> <br />Follett uses several writing techniques that I found quite instructive. <br /> <br />At least once in the story, the omniscient narrator speaks in his own voice, providing a foreshadowing that sets the stage while piquing the reader's interest. The narrator interjects \\"Faber ... Godliman ... two-thirds of a triangle that one day would be crucially completed by ... David and Lucy.\\" <br /> <br />Follett  has Faber ask himself questions about what he should do ... should he bury the five dead men? ...what should he do with the boat? ... should he jump on a passing train? This technique allows the exploration of options within the context of the story instead of more clumsily by the narrator. <br /> <br />There is also a short flashback scene where Faber dreams about his first arrival in London. We first think it's a true dream, but soon learn it is not. This allows us to learn both how Faber actually arrived in London and also how terrified he is about being discovered. <br /> <br />There' much more in this great suspense story, but I think this review has gone on long enough. If you want more, I invite you check my blog. <br />
B00005JPM2|4.0|Anyone who has seen Soldaat van Oranje (soldier of Orange) will want to see Zwartboek (Black Book) by Paul Verhoeven.  The cast names will not be familiar, but all actors are quite competent.  It is the story of a young Jewish female singer and entertainer who barely survives the massacre of a boat load of Jewish refugees by the SS when they attempt to escape to Belgium from Holland during 1944.  She links up with the Dutch Resistance as a spy and insinuates herself into the good graces of a German officer who eventually shows himself to be a good guy reminiscent of the good German in The Pianist.  The plot involves many plots and counterplots and moles and betrayals that do not need to be revealed here.  Verhoeven is a gifted director and the movie is beautifully put together.  There is quite a bit of good music in refreshing contrast to most American movies.  The cinematography is excellent.  The language is Dutch with English subtitles except for a few scenes in German or English.  It is long, but you will have no trouble staying awake.
B000J10ERO|1.0|This movie is just a retread of the original Superman movie.  The plot is basically the same, except for the lame subplot about Superman and Lois' kid.  All of the actors are just doing impressions of their counterparts in the Donner film, instead of taking the parts in new directions.  It seems to me like the film makers wanted to take the safe route and just do a re-make, instead of taking a chance with a new story line.  Luther has his crazy land scheme (never mind that this new version of the scheme would ultimately leave everyone dead, including Luther himself), and then there is the pondorously boring relationship between Lois and Clark.      I have always found it humorous in Superman that all Superman had to do was put on a pair of glasses, and then everybody thought he was a totally different person.  Christoher Reeve played to this and acted like such a coward that you could understand why others could never equate him with Superman, and Donner put in a key scene early, where Louis is being mugged, Clark acts scared and faints, while actually saving louis by grabbing the bullet.  From that point on you could understand why she would never think Clark was Superman.  In this film there is very little difference by the way Superman behaves as himself and Clark except for the glasses thing.  There is even a scene where the main characters are sitting at the Daily Planet, lois is at her desk working, and constantly putting her glasses on and off, and yet no one ever mistakes her for being someone else.  My best advice is to avoid this film and buy the original, everything is just better in that one.  The one star that I gave this movie was for the excellent opening credits, it really got me pumped up, unfortunately it was all down hill from there.
0316018953|1.0|I was extremely disappointed in this book.  It failed to even approach previous books by this author in terms of plot development.  I have read most of Connelly's books in the past and greatly appreciated them.  This was fluff-if did not make any effort to pay attention to detail or character development that his previous books exhibited. I read it in a few hours and wondered at the end why I bothered.  It is a very weak effort by a previously respected author.  I would give it zero stars if it were possible.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The most beautiful filming of earth every filmed. Great viewing for family gatherings, to keep the kids entertained as well as the adults. Just GREAT filming.
B000P0J02E|5.0|Amazing!  I have to say that I've been a Zimmer fan for a long time, and when the first Pirates soundtrack hit, I loved the music, but found that almost all the songs were just variations of the main theme.  It was hard to tell the difference from one song to the next (with a few outstanding exceptions).  Having said that, I still loved it.  The second was just as good, and even had a few new themes that didn't play off the first movie.  The Kraken theme and Jack Sparrow were excellent new introductions that sounded familiar but were different from the first soundtrack.   <br /> <br />Now with the third, we have all kinds of new themes, including the fantastic \\"Hoist the Colors\\" that permeates most of the songs, but in different ways each time.  The fantastic score hasn't gotten old for me, and I have over-listened to it.  I have the CD in my car, and the mp3's on my player, my laptop at work, and my computer at home. <br /> <br />Someone else gave a great review of the separate tracks, and I have to agree with all but two of them:  First is Singapore - I loved it, and though it isn't the best on the soundtrack, it is a great intro to the action in the movie and memorable for it's oriental/pirates mixed flavor (I would rate it at least an 8.5).  Second is Parlay - for some reason, the electric instruments in that are strong and bring the parlay scene strongly to my mind when I hear it (again, at least an 8). <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor, if you love movie music like I do, pick this one up, and if you don't like it the first time, listen to it entirely at least 3 times, you'll fall in love with it.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|Snakes and Arrows is definitely a step up from Vapor Trails but the lyrics still sound like they're forced into a space where they don't quite fit.  Geddy needs to work on that aspect and lose the cheesy vocal effects, he sounds fine with just a nice clean reverb.  The instrumentals are a nice feature, I was quite surprised to hear a guitar only track.
B000N6TX1I|3.0|I just finished watching \\"Children of Men\\" and I'd have to day that I was quite disappointed. I didn't think it was a bad movie though, it did have excellent photography, production, and direction.<br /><br />When the movie started I was really into it, reminded me a lot of the \\"Andrei Tarkovsky\\" films \\"Stalker\\" and \\"Solaris\\" but only bits with \\"Solaris\\". When the film started getting more into the immigration(illegal-immigration... what ever they mean by that) ideas and imagery I really started to feel that the movie was starting to get a bit more preachy about things. Then when they finally rolled into the jail/prison city and there was that over the top blatant \\"Abu Grab\\" related message I mentally through my hands in the air. \\"this is ridiculous\\".<br /><br />I'd have to say I was quite entertained throughout the whole film, it was very engrossing, especially the rescue/escape at the end. Another scene I thought was done very well was when they attempted to slipped away from the farm and were almost caught, a narrow escape indeed.<br /><br />Also i though it was a nice use of \\"The Court of the Crimson King\\" near the beginning of the film.<br /><br />In the featurette one of the ladies talked about what she called the \\"global green zone\\" and all I could think about was how that's essentially a home. I have a home, I keep closed up so I feel safe and I lock the door to protect my family, what's wrong with a country or in this case \\"tribe\\" locking the doors and keeping their people safe or at least feeling safe? Most of the others they had speaking were basically using a lot of facts and speculation to pick-on global capitalism when there's a great deal of other things to aside from just that to put some thought into, like what other things will it conflict with. It all just reminded me about how one-sided scholars can be. Pessimists who never seem to question themselves.<br /><br />Getting back to the movie, fundamentally it speaks for a certain ideology, one who enjoys being right about the folly of man so much that they never take the time to see if they are right about it or if their own beliefs effect these problems in some way.<br /><br />By the end of the move I guess I was a little let down with the way it ended. it really led up to a bunch of nothing... sure I get it about the hope and how their goals were met but.. that was it?.. and he died?...

B000OCXMAE|1.0|Linkin Park, probably one of the most origional music acts that I have followed since 'Hybrid Theory'. One of the main acts in the NU Metal movement of the late 90's early 2000's. They were awesome and their songs were great, but for some reason some of the old school metal fans were saying 'oh these guys are just the Backstreet Boys with guitars'. I actually defended LP...until now. What in gods name happened to this group? All the industrial turntables and screaming and heavy metal guitars have been replaced with EMO! Sorry for all you fans of Dashboard Confessionals but I think that EMO has to go. No one wants to listen to songs about being depressed with whinny whinny lyrics, that was The Smashing Pumpkins job and they did it with style. The only song worth listening to is 'What I've Done' because it is the only song on this album that is true LP. I mean I always say that experimenting with new sounds to evolve is a good thing, but if you plan on doing that don't experiment with a style that has been milked for all it is worth for the past 4 years! For Linkin Park's sake I hope they learn a lesson from this disaster.
B000O5B4C4|5.0|Basic Instinct has been released several times on DVD, but this is the first incarnation on High Definition disc.

Fell in love with Wicked immediately and bought tickets to see it.  We LOVED the show and the music is magical.

The lyrics are wonderful, too.  \\"For Good\\" will really touch you!  If you love great musicals, don't miss this one.  Wicked is destined to be a classic!
0393061310|5.0|Why was the Spaniard Pizarro with his ragtag band of 168 soldiers able to brazenly attack and capture the Inca Emperor Atahuallpa in the midst of 80,000 of his soldiers?  Why, instead, didn't Atahuallpa show up in Spain and go on to sack Madrid and invade Italy?  For that matter, why didn't Aborigines from Australia invade China and go sweeping west towards Europe instead of the Mongols?  Why do modern societies today communicate using satellites while hunter/gatherers like the Bushmen of the Kalahari continue to use Stone Age tools?  This book attempts to answer such questions without resorting to what Jared Diamond refers to as racist arguments.  <br /> <br />Geography, unequal distributions of flora and fauna, and the advantages gained through early food production, population density, and dissemination of ideas and germs gave some cultures huge advantages over others.  This, as opposed to differences in racial characteristics, resulted in some societies thriving and conquering while others got conquered or failed altogether.  Diamond argues that Eurasia, with its east/west axis and size, gave its inhabitants a distinct advantage over those dwelling in Africa and North and South America, with their north/south axes meaning that peoples, innovations, useful crops and domesticated animals would have to travel not only across significant physical barriers such as desert, jungle and mountains, but also have to traverse different climates.  Therefore Eurasian societies benefited significantly more from cross-pollination of ideas and innovations than did societies of other continents.  Parts of Asia, especially the Fertile Crescent and China were also blessed with more than their share of wild plants suitable for domestication -wheat, barley, peas, and lentils in the Fertile Crescent and rice, millet, soybeans and mung beans in China.  In contrast Mesoamerica had only corn -inferior in nutritional value to the Eurasian crops.  Likewise, Eurasia had the luck to have domesticable animal species like the cow, pig, chicken, goat.  In contrast Mesoamerica had only the turkey.  The Andes had the llama and the guinea pig.  Africa with numerous large mammals (elephants, rhinoceros, zebra, antelope, giraffe) would seem to have had enormous opportunity to benefit by raising these animals for food and harnessing them for power.  Diamond shows that these animals and others on other continents failed to be domesticated not because of any short-comings of the human inhabitants, but because these animals failed to satisfy one of the five requirements of a domesticable animal -diet, growth rate (an elephant takes 15 years to reach adult size, as opposed to about a year for a cow), problems of captive breeding (some animals, like cheetahs, just don't feel comfortable mating in a pen or cage), nasty disposition (grizzly bear ranching has never taken off for obvious reasons), tendency to panic (gazelles tend to jump 30 feet when startled), and social structure (some animals herd much better than others -remember the cat herding commercial of a few years ago?  We all know what the reality would be. )  Here is what the author has to say about Zebras - 'Zebras have the unpleasant habit of biting a person and not letting go.  They thereby injure more American zookeepers each year than do tigers!  Zebras are also virtually impossible to lasso with a rope, even for cowboys who win rodeo championships by lassoing horses, because of their unfailing ability to watch the rope noose come towards them and then duck their heads out of the way.' <br /> <br />Areas with the climate and the plants and animals suitable for domestication inevitably gave rise to increased populations and towns, with attendant technology advances and the development of diseases, both of which were then passed on to adjacent areas.  In Eurasia this happened more easily than in Africa and the Americas, areas which were deficient in useful plants and animals to start with, leading to lower populations and fewer cities.  Disease was a huge factor in the conquering of the America's indigenous peoples by Europeans.  Diseases introduced by Europeans eventually killed 95 per cent of the pre-Columbian Native American population.  The Europeans, of course, largely had immunity to their own diseases and just didn't encounter anything nearly as virulent coming from the other side. <br /> <br />This book is well written, easy to read, and stuffed with amazing facts that are a delight to encounter on their own, in addition to strengthening the author's thesis: <br />-Native Australians kept captive dingoes as company, watchdogs, and even as living blankets, giving rise to the expression 'five dog night' to mean a very cold night. <br />-Of the world's 148 big wild herbivore mammals, only 14 could be domesticated, the majority in Eurasia. <br />-The major killer diseases of humanity -smallpox, influenza, tuberculosis, malaria, plague, measles, cholera -all evolved from diseases of animals. <br />-kuru (laughing sickness) was transmitted by New Guinea highland babies licking their fingers after playing with the raw brains that their mothers had just cut out of murdered enemies that happened to have kuru. <br />-When the Canadian Pacific railroad was being built through Saskatchewan in the 1880's, that province's Native Americans, who had previously had little exposure to whites and their germs, died of tuberculosis at the incredible rate of 9 per cent per year. <br />-When syphilis was first recorded in Europe (1495) it was much more virulent, causing pustules that covered the body from head to the knees, causing flesh to fall off people's faces, and causing death within a few months.  By 1546 syphilis had evolved into the disease with the symptoms so well known to us today.  The disease had adapted, so that by keeping its victims alive longer, it could spread its spirochete offspring into more victims. <br /> <br />

080701429X|5.0|Have you ever wondered what your purpose is?  I picked up this book after two speakers referred to it as a must read book.  One was a Vietnam POW the other a top producing salesman.  I was impressed by both of them and wanted to know what they found in this book that helped them.  I wasn't disappointed. <br /> <br />Instead of me telling you about the book, I'd recommend getting and reading it.  It's fairly short and not as difficult to read as some have suggested.  I think you'll be better off.  I liked it so much I bought 10 of them and hand them out to people I think need some inspiration. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0060763280|3.0|I already knew the information T. Harv writes about in this book.  But sometimes it is necessary to hear the same message over and over so it finally sinks in. He talks about how all wealth (whether it be money, spiritual, psychological etc) starts in the mind.  This really is the same message that Napoleon Hill said in his groundbreaking book, \\"Think and Grow Rich\\".  In fact, you won't read ANY wealth creation book that isn't a variation of Napoleon's (including \\"The Secret\\").  And for that matter, Napoleon's principles are straight out the Bible, so they all are rip-offs of The Good Book. Basically, these types of books are just to reinforce what everyone else is saying with their personal twist on it.  Harv talks about influences and money blueprints.  That's fine, I can relate to that because I did receive some messed up money mantras when I was a child.  And it does take a lot of effort to re-write those messages. I guess I'm not the only one receiving those messages, considering all the class envy we have in today's society.  The one message I got from this book is: instead of concentrating on what your next door neighbor has, think your way into the lifestyle you want.  Your life will be a lot happier if you pursue your passion, instead of trying to take away another person's.  This is a good book to help reinforce what you probably already know. But, if you want to read the same thing without spending any money, go read your Bible.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|Wow! I was shocked when I first heard this disc. Rush has drifted back to Moving Pictures/Signals era with a blend of the newer sound. This isn't 2112 Rush but I really like it. Less synth and more guitar, a couple of instrumentals, and Neil drums and lyrics make this a tight disc. Rolling Stone's review was spot on. 3 stars, add two if you are a Rush fan and subtract two if you aren't. I don't see this bringing in a whole lot of new fans but the ones that are already here will love it.
B000NA2BEU|1.0|I loved Veronica Mars.  Season one was spectacular.  Season two wobbled a bit, but there was still so much good that I was overjoyed that it was given a third season.  Now I wish it hadn't.  There are so many things wrong with season three I barely know where to begin.  There was the most hateful, sexist portrayal of feminists outside of neoconservative hate speech.  And the re-writing of events from previous seasons to such a ludicrous degree that it felt like none of the writers had even seen the show before, ever.  Then there was the marginalization of Wallace, the really weird and inappropriate joking between Keith and Veronica that bordered on pedophilia.  How about the oh so funny male rape jokes?  And I haven't even gotten to Veronica yet!  There was not one sympathetic thing about her this season.  She was hard and cold and cruel.  I couldn't identify with her on any level whatsoever.  I highly recommend, if you truly loved Veronica Mars in the first two seasons, just skip this season and pretend the show ended after two seasons.  It's not worth watching, not even for 'completeness'.
1579126227|5.0|The novel Mysterious Affair at Styles: A Hercule Poirot Mystery by Agatha Christie is the perfect staring point for any fan of the mystery/thriller genre.  There is a reason Ms. Christie is one of the most popular and prolific writers - with some 80+ titles to her credit - she is as enjoyable today as she was in 1920, when this classic was published.  It is in this novel that we are first introduced to Hercule Poirot, an off little man who uses his little grey cells to solve mysteries.  This is not Ms. Christies best work; however, it is a great foundation for truly enjoying a true fan favorite and mystery's true MVP!

The problem is, you will be in such a hurry to figure out who the suspect is, you will race through the book in no time at all.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and enjoy The Murder of Roger Ackroyd: A Hercule Poirot Mystery, by Agatha Christie.  It is a 5 star book.  It is a true testament to the author's talents that over 80 years later, the novel is being re-released as a hardback.  I expect nothing less than a new legion of fans to discover the fun of a Christie novel.

A young teenager has to kill her father in self-defense and later we learn that she is a product of incest, her mother's sister and daughter at once.

Had I applied the power of thinking without thinking in the store, I would have saved myself $15.
1416914285|4.0|Under the sparkling steel and neon lights of Manhattan, a race of ethereal warriors called Shadowhunters fights malicious demons. Artist Clary Fray is blissfully ignorant of the existence of Shadowhunters until one dry-ice hazy night at the Pandemonium Club when she sees Draco Malfoyesque Jace Wayland pull a knife on a demon disguised as a blue-haired boy. When she follows Jace out of the pulsating club and into a scene of supernatural murder, his partners in otherworldly crimefighting are surprised to learn that she, a Mundane, can see them. Mundanes, or everyday folk, aren't supposed to be able to see the preternaturally swift Shadowhunters.    <br /> <br />Clary is ready to ignore the murderous incident until Jace shows up at a coffee shop she's visiting with her best friend, the almost witty, slightly bumbling Simon. Jace won't forget Clary's remarkable vision, and while he's explaining the basics of his paranormal underground existence, Clary receives a disturbing phone call from her mother. She races home to find her artisan's apartment trashed, her beloved (if sometimes antagonistic) mother missing and a scaly, fanged demon in her hallway.   With the carefully dispersed, often frustrating knowledge imparted to her by Jace, his tutor Hodge and his snooty fellow Shadowhunters, Alec and Isabelle, Clary finds that she has a Shadowhunter legacy through her mother, Jocelyn.   <br /> <br />Knowing she cannot go back to her demolished, demon-infested apartment, Clary stays in the underground home of the Clave. The Shadowhunters are part of a diverse and complex world of beings that most earthbound Mundanes have only heard about in fairy tales. By legend, the Shadowhunter race is over one-thousand years old, and a magical cup was used at one point to create Shadowhunters out of humans. The magical cup is missing, and Clary believes that her mother's disappearance is tied to it.  <br /> <br />Amid the dry lessons in Shadowhunter politics and history, Clary continues tolook for her mother. Her search takes her to a party hosted by a blue-lipped man with glitter nail polish, abandoned hotels and houses, and the apartment of her downstairs neighbor, a tea-serving, scarf-clad psychic with knowledge of the Shadowhunters. In the end, Clary's tireless search will reveal much more to her than just her mother's history.   <br /> <br />It helps if you're already familiar with the world of werewolves and demons before jumping into this whirlwind urban fantasy, because author Cassandra Clare draws on many different legends and tales while building Clary's New York. Although the book often gets dragged down in too many lurid adjectives and uneven pacing, the story of an underground world of demon hunters is appealing and unique. If you like theatrical, fey dialogue, a little humor with your action and many references to familiar fantasy stories, then CITY OF BONES --- and the subsequent installments in this new series --- may be the perfect fit for you. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Carlie Webber

1932100660|5.0|This book is a meticulous, transparent analysis of the relationship between nutrition and disease.  It is written in terms that are very easy to understand and draws support from research conducted all over the world.  A friend recommended this book to me 5 months ago, and since I read it I've ordered 23 copies for the people I care about. <br /> <br />The book deals with the diseases that so regularly take the lives of the ones we love, and provides information that empowers the reader to take preventative control over his or her health that may preclude protracted, expensive, or fatal bouts with diseases such as diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, macular degeneration, multiple schlerosis, Alzheimers, arthritis, kidney stones, osteoperosis and others.  It is a ground-breaking book with revolutionary implications for health and well-being. <br /> <br />My father has a history of coronary disease and had been living at high risk of future heart problems.  He worked as a doctor for 30 years and read this book with great scrutiny, but was thoroughly convinced by what he read and impressed by the quality of the sources cited.  He became a vegan after reading the book two months ago.  Since that time his cholesterol has gone down 50 points and he has lost 15 pounds!  The father of a good friend of mine has seen similar results after adopting a vegan diet, losing 20 pounds and dropping 40 cholesterol points in one month! <br /> <br />I'm very excited about the potential of this book and look very forward to the changes it may bring about in our culture and the health of our nation. <br /> <br />-Brian Jordan <br />
B000E97X66|5.0|When I first started listening to Springsteen, I was pretty luke-warm on the song Kitty's Back.  Then I heard a bootleg version, with extended jamming, and I fell in love with it.  Sadly, I lost the bootleg tape (don't even know what show it was from, this was circa 1980).  So I'll tell you point blank, I bought this album mainly just to get a live version of Kitty's Back. <br /> <br />Let me tell you, the Kitty's Back here is well worth the price of the album all by itself.  Tremendous, lived up to and exceeded my hopes.  The rest of the album is just gravy (and delicious gravy at that!).  The band is just outstanding.  I'd never been much impressed with Max the drummer until I heard him here, where he's doing great stuff.  I'd ALWAYS been impressed with Roy Bittan on piano, and even he exceeded my expectations here and raised my high opinion of him even higher!  The band is tight and energetic, just impeccable.  I could do with a little less of Bruce taking minor liberties with the melodies on some of the songs, but the band is outstanding. <br /> <br />Oh, and for those who bitched that they released the CD after the DVD was already available to try to milk more money out of people:  not everyone is a collector-of-everything, not everyone has or even wants the DVD.  I was very happy to buy this on CD, since my main interest is listening to it in the car.  I don't have the DVD and may never own it.

B000N4SHPS|5.0|Even while this was in the theatres, reviews and critics were praising this movie.  I, on the other hand, was afraid to believe the hype.  Even after talking myself into renting this, it sat around the house for days because I still couldn't bring myself to believe that this film would actually be good.  But boy am I glad I finally hit the play button.  I had forgotten how much I enjoyed Rocky Balboa and it's strange how he feels like an old friend I haven't seen in a while.  I'm impressed with Rocky's wisdom and understand his heartbreak over Adrian.  Afterall, I've known her for thirty years too.  In no time, I'm quite charmed by Rocky's humbleness and inspired by his unconquerable soul.  The script is a bit laid back and not over the top like Rocky 2 thru 4. (I like to pretend that 5 never happened.)  In short, this is a wonderful film about a remarkable character.  You won't be disappointed.

B000MZHW40|4.0|despite itself.  This film as well as the press coverage surrounding its pre-theatrical release did bring attention to this monstrous situation in Africa. I confess, I didn't know anything about conflict diamonds prior to this.  I'm not a jewlry person.  I don't own a single diamond-or cubic zirconia.  Back to the movie.  Despite a compelling situation a couple of good acting performances, (Djimon Hounsou particularly.), great cinmetography and even score, the movie fails at making a grand slam with me.  There are way too many coinsidences and all three of our main characters are apparently shielded by a jedi's force given how they are able to dodge a billion bullets. Dicaprio's accent is strong in the begining and dies down considerably before we hit the mid marker.  It's never completely gone (circa Kevin Costner's Robin Hood) but it is noticable.  The romance (if you want to call it that) was sort of forced and seem to come out of nowhere.  Before you hit the final act, you can pretty much guess the Hollywood ending you're heading toward.  BUT it's still a good film and worth seeing.
B00005V9IJ|5.0|Something about this movie speaks to my soul. Something about the lack of dialogue in this movie refreshes me. Maybe because life is so hurried and harried, I just like how this movie slows you down, strips away the many layers of life, and exposes a bit of the seed within. There's no rush. No animals attacking him on the island. No pirates. No frenetic struggle. Just the quiet struggle of a man who decides to keep going, to keep breathing. The camera lingers on scenes of silence, and somehow, it just works for me. The movie's messages that resonate with me are the acceptance of life's losses, the resolution to keep going despite those losses, the perseverence to continue hoping, and the ingenuity and imagination to explore new possibilities. The movie's score nicely accompanies these themes.

1579126278|5.0|The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is considered by many to be Agatha Christie's best novel while others consider it fatally flawed due to the nature of the solution to the crime.  It's impossible to debate the merits of that argument here without giving away the ending, so we'll move on to a more general discussion of the book and its merits as I see them. <br /> <br />Poirot \\"retires\\" to a small village and almost immediately is drawn to investigate two deaths.  One is due to an overdose of a sleeping drug, which some call accidental and others call suicide.  The other is more obviously murder as the victim has been stabbed to death.  Poirot, of course, is called upon to use his little gray cells to solve the crimes.  As usual, we meet an interesting array of characters and most of them seem to have had a motive to kill Roger Ackroyd but Poirot eliminates them from consideration one-by-one.  Until we come to the murderer, that is.  I won't give away the solution but it is the person I thought most likely in the beginning and then let myself drift away from for various reasons.   <br /> <br />The Murder of Roger Ackroyd deserves its status as one of Christie's best novels.  The story is well told, as narrated by the town's doctor, and moves along at a good pace.  Poirot is as entertaining as ever, and the characters are interesting enough for you to care what happens to them.   <br />

1579126235|5.0|Murder on the Orient Express is almost certainly the most famous Agatha Christie novel and may well be the best-known novel from the entire mystery genre.  Despite the fact that I had been told the solution to the case many years ago, I decided to go ahead and finally read the book and am very glad that I did.<br /><br />The basic plot, for any who don't already know, involves a murder on board a train with a small, but colorful, group of passengers.  It becomes apparent relatively quickly that no one could have possibly committed the murder but Poirot has no option except to exercise his little gray cells to their utmost in an effort to solve the case.  The story moves along at a nice clip and the cast is varied and interesting.  My favorite aspect of any Poirot novel tends to be the little Belgian himself and he is in fine form here.<br /><br />It is a tribute to Agatha Christie's writing that I could enjoy reading a mystery novel so much on my first read even knowing the murderer before starting.  The book is an excellent choice whether you are an old Poirot fan who hasn't gotten around to it yet or a first-time Christie reader.
B000NA2BEU|1.0|[[ASIN:B000A59PMO Veronica Mars - The Complete First Season]] was practically perfect in every way -- I was emotionally invested by the end of the Pilot and loved following Veronica's journey as she searched for her best friend's murderer. [[ASIN:B000FL7CAK Veronica Mars - The Complete Second Season]] started out much weaker by focusing on boring characters and lame gotchas(!), but went out strong with a shocking and intense final episode.    On the other hand, Season 3 has barely held my attention for a large variety of reasons. Characters I've grown to love and care about have been tossed aside as unimportant in order to make room for new, boring stereotypes, like Piz. Veronica has become virtually unrecognizable as she alienates her father, boyfriend and the majority of her friends/classmates in her eternal search for \\"justice.\\" She's not a character I can care about or root for any longer, but I kept watching in the hopes that there would be a Season 2-style turnaround.    However, I quickly grew disgusted with the repeated storylines involving rape and sexual humiliation and the disrespectful way the writers treated these topics -- even having Veronica, a survivor of sexual assault, make jokes about rape. Everything I use to love about this show has been diminished or re-written because the writers are lazy and misogynistic.    Furthermore, even the once top-notch acting has decreased in quality. Kristen Bell relies on OVER THE TOP \\"humorous\\" scenes to make up for the fact that she's phoning it in 90% of the time, Enrico Colantini seems just as bored, except when he & Kristen are sharing one of the inappropriate father-daughter jokey scenes that have popped up this season. Jason Dohring, who was so brilliant as Logan that he quickly became the most popular character after Veronica, has even languished this season, mumbling most of his lines.    My recommendation to you: SAVE YOUR MONEY. The first season is definitely worth it and if you can suffer through the first half of the second season, it gets a LOT better. The third season is so awful, I didn't even watch the last few episodes, so don't bother watching if you didn't already.
076790382X|5.0|In this book, Bill Bryson presents a compilation of weekly columns he had published upon his return from England to the States, after being away for 20 years. And boy did he had a cultural shock! He presents in a VERY funny way the things that we take for granted every day and, one by one, dissects the very elements that make up the American way of life in an insightful way.<br /><br />The book is assembled in a chapter fashion with a certain structure that connects them whenever applicable. The chapters are short and self-contained enough to turn the book into an endless feed of amazing 5-minute fun reads before bedtime or while you are sitting in a waiting room.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Being one that has not followed Al Gore as closely as some over the years, I found this documentary to be a huge eye-opener.  <br />  <br />Gore is a great story-teller.  He weaves in stories of his personal life, his political life, and the life of his ancestors.  This demonstrates that not only is this a political move on his part, but how what he has to say is effecting people just like you and I.  He knows exactly who he is targeting in this documentary, and hits a wide range of Americans. <br />  <br />Covers many facets of the threat of Global Warming, including statistics of weather, seasons, natural disasters, and more.  He has worked closely with many scientists and researchers that back up his statements throughout. <br />  <br />Not only does this documentary show you all the problems, but gives you reasonable solutions of how you as the individual can make an impact.  Not by spending lots of money or volunteer time, but very simple choices that can be so easy to integrate into one's normal and busy lifestyle. <br />
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have seen most of the film productions of this wonderful novel and each has its merits and weak points.  I have just looked at the Michael Jayston/Sorcha Cusack version from 1973 and also have the Timothy Dalton version from the early 1980s as well as various other versions.  However, this one stands out for me as my favourite.  Although quite \\"compact\\" compared the two versions just mentioned, this one has a fire in its belly that the others don't.  Here's a few thoughts to share:<br /><br />In my DVD, there are interviews with the two principals, Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens and Stephens in his interview, hits the nail on the head about how very much Jane and Rochester are very much sexual beings.  This version brings that out very clearly in the most tender and touching way.  I thought the scenes in the last episode were particularly well done.  We have Jane, living with St John Rivers and his family, remembering the aftermath of the terrible visit to see Bertha after the wedding is called off.  Here we have a Jane who is clearly attracted to Rochester in the most erotic way; he likewise clearly desires her with deep, deep longing.  How these two suffer when Jane leaves Thornfield.<br /><br />The concluding scenes when Jane returns to Rochester at Ferndean Manor are clearly demonstrative of the passionate nature of these two.  These scenes alone are a miracle of Bronte's imagination.  That such a sheltered woman, living so remotely (the Bronte parsonage is quite grim) could create such very human creatures whose sexuality jumps off the page is miraculous.<br /><br />And, in this version, the character of St John Rivers is very well developed and one can see how Jane might be tempted by him.<br /><br />After watching this version and the Jayston/Cusack version I re-read the book.  Although not as faithful (literally) to the book, I think this one captures the passion, spirit and sexuality of the protagonists.  This is a DVD version of the literary \\"keeper\\" andI shall return to it again and again.
B000IOM0WY|1.0|I recently rented this movie from Netflix and I'm glad I didn't buy it due to the poor video quality. The picture is grainy at 1080P like others described especially at low light levels. When you spend the money upgrading to Blu-Ray, there is a certain expectation that the quality will be substantially better, and in this case it is awful. A pity since this is a great movie. Paramount, shame on you.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I was surprised how good this CD is.  I shouldn't be though.  RUSH has consistently delivered top quality, hot rock.  I think this was album number 2000 or something but you can't seem to stop these guys.  There is a little liner note that says \\"All songs composed by Lee and Lifeson, with lyrics by Peart...\\".  What a team! <br /> <br />Being a drummer, I follow Neil a bit.  He is amazing... <br />Wait until you listen to \\"The Main Monkey Business\\".  It will blow you away.  \\"Faithless\\" and \\"Bravest Face\\" will remind you that RUSH likes to get in your head with their lyrics and then not get out.  This is a theme album but each song stands up nicely by itself. <br /> <br />If you only have one RUSH album - this should not be it.  But you should have lots of RUSH - lots - and this one too.
B000O5AYCA|5.0|I say 'art rock' but The National really defies definition. This CD harkens back to 'Cherry Tree' with its thoughtful pace and lush sound. While Alligator was kind of jarring in its changes from fast to slow Boxer builds in momentum and seriousness. 'Mistaken For Strangers' could be a late Smiths/early Morrissey song with its minor chords and lilting rhythums. Also like the Smiths Boxer feels more like Matt Berninger's voice is blending into the music rather than the music filling in under him like in previous CDs. I encourage everyone to see The National live as they put on a great show and the true brilliance of the arrangements comes out on stage. The incredibly overrated Surfjin Stevens plays on the CD and The National is often compared to Arcade Fire. Two acts that sell alot more records. Why??? There is no comparison!
B0002ZMITY|2.0|After watching Borat, and loving it. I decided to watch Ali G Indahouse. From the hilarity of Borat, I expected Sacha Baron Cohen's Ali G Indahouse to be just as funny, and entertaining, I was wrong. While Ali G provides some hilarious moments, there are too many slow spots in the movie. There were times I laughed by butt off, them other times the movie was so boring. If you loved \\"Borat\\" rent \\"Ali G Indahouse\\" it is not anywhere near as good as \\"Borat.\\" 2 1/2 stars, worth a rental!
B000OCXFCO|3.0|Ive been a Megadeth fan since day one, Dave has always stood out and came across sincere in his anger and vision, ive always expected and gotten well crafted music and highly skilled musicians at the top of their game.          That being said, I understand some of the positive reviews here, this album isnt horrible...but statements like \\"the best album ive ever heard\\"?  You have to be kidding.  On its own its ok, but it is not the Megadeth most of us 80s teenagers grew up loving, and if you missed the 80s and the birth of thrash then go back and start there....not here.     I agree with Marty's absence being felt.  Drover is a fine guitar player, but his solo's do not enhance the tunes anywhere close to the way  Marty's did. (contrast him to Dave as well....not even close)            Theres some GREAT guitar playing here, and some killer riffs. My biggest complaint is the vocal melodies and arrangements.  They just feel tired to me.  Some of these tunes sound like they are rough tracks or first takes on the vocals.  Theres no hook, no catch...just blah blah change the syllables and make it fit....very un-creative sounding. Almost amatuerish in nature.  The content is the content...if you don't like Dave's politics dont buy a Megadeth album.   But I do expect catchy, heavy, well done tunes.  Overall i'm just not feeling it. Blessed Are The Dead in particular starts out good, begins to build a killer tension and you just feel the crusher coming....but nope....the vocal melody comes in and ruins it...\\"nation will rise against nation\\"...etc.  Next.  Gears Of War and Burnt Ice are much the same.   Although Sleepwalker has the spit and anger I like about Megadeth.        And NOONE has mentioned this Jack Bauer thing on the sleeve???? Are you kidding me?  Jack Bauer...a cheesy TV show character?   Are you serious Dave?  I realize even Vic is a fictional character...but this?  If theres anything Megadeth NEVER stood for...it was the mainstream.  This turns ANY relevancy the lyrics or the cover art has into a joke.  Im amazed the man who concieved Peace Sells or Rust In Peace would use such a stupid shameless thing and actually feel its cool. Absolutely amazing.      But back to the music.  Im not sad I bought it and i'll buy their next one the day it comes out too.   Buy it, listen to it, but dont expect it to change your world or to be Rust In Peace.
B000000Y2F|5.0|The sound is not good, but these two masters of jazz of all time together are simply great.

B000FIMG68|5.0|I watch a lot of T.V and there are a lot of great shows but this is by far the very best. No sitcom will ever match up to this
B00065MDSG|5.0|This is the only band of the story of rock who do more and more, and every work is different, new, interesting, you will never listen an old album, this band is ever new!
B000OCXFCO|3.0|First, I'm a HUGE Megadeth fan and have been listening to them for years ... through all the lineup changes, so I was really psyched for this CD's drop date. <br /> <br />I gotta say that this CD is a disappointment. I've listened to it at least a dozen times and it just feels like Dave is running out of ideas. As I listen to this disc, I find myself thinking, \\"I swear I've heard this song before.\\" <br /> <br />Marty Friedman seemed to really inspire the band when he was in and he absence is huge now, IMO. <br /> <br />The CD isn't bad, it just isn't as good as I hoped it was going to be.

B000KKPN5C|5.0|This flash does everything the amateur photographer could want. While there are no operations on the external shell of the flash (you have to program it through your camera), its small size, versatility, and the swivel head for bouncing the light off the ceiling or wall are all great features worth buying. Great price and it even comes with a cute little case for it which actually serves a purpose!
B000000Y2F|5.0|The sound is not good, but these two masters of jazz of all time together are simply great.
B00002428O|5.0|Every track an absolute classic, which just grows and grows on you on each hearing. This is definitely recommended, especially after a hard day in the office. It just fits. The lyrics, as usual, are laconic philosophical poetry, and the music flies you away to the farthest sanctuary of reason, far from the madding social mess us Westerners are growing up (down?) in. Definitely buy this - it's great!
B00008BXJF|5.0|The first time i listen this music was at the concert in Turin, belive in me, this cd is a great experience, this band is the best rock band of all time, but the word \\"rock\\" is too small for this great musicians!
0736063684|4.0|I wanted a boook that would help give me new Ideas and  Tips.. this book was it.. Now I have incorporated a new routine that should work.. and give me better result.
B000JLTRIQ|5.0|Excellent movie.  Fast Shipping.  Very happy with this purchase.  Excellent movie to add to your collection.
B00006D295|5.0|You need a certain personality to like this movie. I loved it. The first time I didn't think there was much of a plot to it. Which is the main reason why my friend doesn't like it (How many \\"comedies\\" today have not plot? too many). But watching it a second time, I understood it better. The music is amazing. Time Warp is my favorite song. Its bizzare. Everyone should watch this film at least once in their life.
B00067BBSC|5.0|In this live concert DVD \\"Toto\\" looks and sounds better than ever. The picture is crystal clear and the 5.1 Dolby Digital and DTS surround sound are incredible to say the least. Not only is Simon Phillips a great drummer, his mixing and producing skills are simply amazing. Bobby Kimball can still belt it out and Steve Lukather can still light it up on guitar. These guys can still rock and this live concert DVD proves it.    The \\"Toto\\" 25th Anniversary Live In Amsterdam DVD is a must for any Toto fan. Whether you're an old fan of Toto or just discovering them for the first time, you can't go wrong with this concert DVD. The Audio CD included is an added bonus, making this release an even better deal for \\"Toto\\" fans. As for the DVD extra's, you either like them or you don't. Fortunately the extra's don't take anything away from this awesome live concert performance. My only complaint is that (99) was not included in the song list.       DVD Features Include:   -The latest performances of Toto's greatest hits captured in hi-definition video   -Featuring 5.1 & DTS surround sound   -Exclusive footage shot on the \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" tour    Songs:  1. Girl Goodbye, Goodbye Elenore, Child's Anthem, I'll Supply the Love  2. Gift with a Golden Gun  3. While My Guitar Gently Weeps   4. Bodhisattva   5. Africa   6. David Paich - Solo   7.

B000059XUO|5.0|First time I saw this film, I watched it on VHS. Not that great. It was extremely dark and I had a hard time seeing things. I popped in the DVD and WOW! I could see what was going on! It's great. The story is beautiful, dark but powerful. I highly recommend this film. Especially this eddition.
1594200823|4.0|I've read reviews of Pollan's writing that complain about his pedantic tone or his \\"abuse of five-syllable words.\\"  I don't find that to be true, but Pollan IS a professor.  His writing naturally takes an academic tone.  That being said, this book changed the way I think about eating.  I am an adventurous eater, cautious about food additives, an even more cautious shopper, a gardener, and an enthusiastic cook.  I have long since stopped shopping at x-marts, support my local produce store which buys from local farmers in season, shop the farmers markets, and buy organic when possible.  And I have a TINY food budget-grocery shopping at wild oats/whole foods and boutique food stores is not possible for my family.  If you are open to re-thinking how you shop and eat, this book can have a tremendous impact on one's eating.  If you go into reading this feeling the tiniest bit defensive of American spending and eating habits, you'll only grow more so.  I highly recommend this book.
B000NA2776|5.0|I was walking into a local bookstore in Atlanta last night, when I saw a poster on the door advertising Mika's upcoming Atlanta concert. This was the first time I had heard of Mika. He was being compared to Freddie Mercury and George Michael on the poster so I figured he must be worth a listen, so I bought a copy of the CD at the store on faith after a friend told me it was a must-have. I bought the CD, and listened to it all the way home, and was blown away!  <br /> <br />I could instantly tell Mika is a very talented, gifted, and creative young man. I love the wide variety of the songs. They definitely do not all sound the same. There is something here for just about everyone to like. I'm a sucker for songs with catchy, singable melodies and great vocal harmonies (that's why I'm also a Ben Folds fan), and there is plenty of that on this album.  <br /> <br />I'm still very early in the learning stage concerning Mika, but I see he is constantly compared to Freddie Mercury. As a BIG fan of Mercury and Queen, I can definitely see their influence, and Mika's voice certainly is similar to Mercury's, but in my opinion he sounds more like George Michael. In fact, there were times when I would have sworn it was Michael who was singing. Stylistically, I hear a lot of Beatles, Bee Gees, Queen, and especially Sweet in his music. If he wanted to, I'm sure he could do an identical cover of \\"Ballroom Blitz\\". Some other artists mentioned by reviewers are ones I'm not really familiar with, so I can't comment on his similarity to them. <br /> <br />Mika has definitely earned a new fan!
0312323867|4.0|i was really curious reading this book especially from darcy point of view. since i'm sure we all hated her after emily's first book.  It's really interesting how i turn from hating her to feeling sorry for her and actually cheering her on(reluctantly of course) at the end.  I thought emily did a good job on transitioning darcy's character.  I really enjoy  this book and i can't wait for her next book coming out.  I already bought baby proof.
0618680004|5.0|If you are a believer, read chapter 7.  If your a non-beliver you will love the whole book.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I've no words to well how excellent is this documentary... it's a crime not to have it!! 100% recommended.
0440237688|5.0|This was not required reading for me in school, and I would have missed The Giver all togeather were it not for a friend who insisted that I should read it.<br /><br />I just finished the book last night and I have to say I was floored. though I admit I probably woudn't have gotten so much out of it, had I read it as a child. to me the genius to The Giver is the the way that Lowry slowly builds the world of The Community, so that the reader does not fully realize the disurbing emptiness of Jonas's reality until quite late in the story. Perhaps even more suprising is that until that point there is a twisted kind of logic to the society in which Jonas lives, this certainly does make you question yourself. I was fancinated by The Giver himself, though the character of the wise old  man can be found in coutless other novels, I find somthing unique and endearing about him. I have a have a habit of reading aloud when I'm alone and especially taken with a book, but the seen in which Jonas's father \\"releses\\" the smaller twin made me wish i hadn't actually said the words. I won't be getting over that scene in a hurry. In short The experience of The Giver is one that should be passed on.
B0000X61UU|5.0|I've been using this tape for 10 years now I think.  Just updated to DVD.   Quickest results I've gotten from anything.  Not good for bad backs so if that is an issue, i would pick something else or skip all the back exersizes.
0151013047|5.0|Like Kazuo Ishiguro's brilliant NEVER LET ME GO, this fantastic novel is one that you should finish before reading reviews since knowing too much of the plot will spoil this story for you. Also set aside enough time to finish THE RELUCTANT FUNDAMENTALIST in one sitting for you will not be be able to put it down. I was hooked by page 4--the novel is slim, consisting of 184 pages but it is too rich and intense to be much longer-- when the narrator describes Princeton University as raising her skirt \\"for the corporate recruiters who came onto campus and--as you say in America--showed them some skin.\\"  About that narrator-- he is a Pakistani named Changez who is now 25 years old who is telling his story to an unnamed nervous American as they have a meal at a cafe in Lahore (\\"there is no need to reach under your jacket, I assume to grasp your wallet\\"). Educated at Princeton and the recipient of financial aid, he accepted a position at the high-powered financial firm of Underwood Samson immediately out of college and worked tirelessly, always achieving more than his elite American co-workers. He also fell in love with the beautiful but sad American Erica. He was in Manilla on assignment on that ignominious day of September 11 when his world, and those of many others, changed. Enough of the plot. Changez' extended dramatic monologue will affect you in many different ways. You will be at once sympathetic to this complex character but repelled by him.<br /><br />Mr. Hamid's richly nuanced novel will keep you reading as the tension builds. He asks difficult questions that many of us would choose to avoid, specifically about the perception of the United States in the Middle East and other parts of the world as well and the reasons why we are hated so. In Changez he has created a character that you will not soon forget. The title of the novel speaks multitudes.
B000IOM1Y6|3.0|It's Eye in the Sky after all... it was a great album.  Had a lot of ups, a couple downs as the album gets a little to poppish with \\"Step by Step\\".  Overall, this is the most successful Alan Parsons Project album and also one of the best albums as well for that band.   <br /> <br />But this review is about the remaster.  The improved sound quality... what improved sound quality?  The music on the original CD sounds almost identical to the new release (granted... this isn't a \\"remix\\").  So if you are looking to really step it up a notch with this CD, unless you are going from tape to CD, you aren't getting a noticeable sound improvement here.  Granted, I don't own a $2000 sound system, so maybe for them, it is improved, but for most people, I don't think they'll appreciate any new quality to the sound. <br /> <br />That said, the extra tracks are indeed interesting.  The best being the two last tracks.  The first of those two is a conglomeration of studio recordings in the process of developing the songs.  The second is a conglomeration of the orchestral music developed for the songs.  These two tracks are really cool to listen to.  It seems apparent that the Alan Parsons Project didn't have B sides, because there are no extra songs really as part of the additional tracks.  You'll just be hearing first / second draft recordings of some of the songs.  The experience is really neat. <br /> <br />The other additional feature is added material in the CD booklet.  Pics and stuff from the mind of Alan Parsons and Eric Wolfson.  Perhaps the only thing that would have been nicer was contributions from the other members or guest members of the band, but all in all, the additional material given in the booklet definitely is nice. <br /> <br />To round it out, overall, you aren't getting too much from this.  You'll read the booklet once or twice, you won't be able to listen to the raw tracks that often like you could the album itself and as I noted, at least from my experiencefrom Eye in the Sky (and I Robot), these remasters aren't particularly ground shattering in their remastery (you can go pretend that's a word ;)).  <br /> <br />Luckily, the price isn't expensive.  Whoever was in charge of the releases had mercy and realized they weren't giving us much we hadn't already had.  To me the most important thing is the sound!  So buying up all these new remasters probably won't be my plan.  However, if you really want to hear the additional tracks, especially the \\"naked\\" tracks and appreciate the material put into the CD booklets, you won't be wasting your money.
0767805712|5.0|A very good futeristic movie. Our world becomes a place where you lot in life is decied by how good your DNA is. If you like scifi or pretty boys with pretty eyes you cant go wrong with this movie! Also very slash-able! ;)<br /><br />-ksha2222
B000025XKM|3.0|This album was recommended by Jeff Tweedy in a WSJ \\"Hit List\\" column and sounded interesting. I was not disappointed by what I heard but obviously do not appreciate it as much as Mr. Tweedy. I believe that someone who is into the finer points of acoustic guitar playing would really enjoy this album.

B000002KKC|4.0|A good album, and well worth the money.  It is; however; not the best from Fleetwood Mac.
B000BKVQTS|3.0|Good movie but I felt that something was missing. Maybe if the two guys had really kissed at the end. *g*<br /><br />-ksha2222
B00008PW3Q|5.0|This has fast became my favorite Fleetwood Mac album.  I love the mix between Stevie and Lindsay.  I feel like this album really shows what Lindsay can do (this album has the most songs from him that I actually like) and showcases what we have come to expect from Stevie.  It is quite different from the other Fleetwood Mac albums, but I feel like that is what makes it stand out to me.  They have changed through out the years and continue to make great music.
B00000G42T|5.0|I grew up with George Micheal for over 20 years. Every since I was in elementary school. My mother introduced me to him. I loved his music. I used to get in trouble because of him. It kind of affected my schoolwork. I forgive him for his arrest for the bathroom bit. I tried to forget about what his did, and move on. I may not approve that he is gay, but I don't hate him. He is still a good artist. I may like him for another 20 years to come.
B00003XACV|5.0|I purchased ths item for my husband because he loves the score of this movie. The CD arrived in adequate packaging, and the product was un-damaged and played perfectly. The haunting sounds of this CD are ideal for sleeping with. Sounds crazy and some of the tracks are sporadic and not good for restful sleep, but with modern technology you can pick the tracks you want to listen to over and over.
0439813786|5.0|Page turning story, beautiful illustrations.  We all loved it (7 to 38).
0060872675|5.0|So we're in the bookstore, and my husband says \\"You have to read this book... right now.\\" And then he hands me a large flatboard picture book called \\"Where's My Cow?\\" I am baffled. I'm even further baffled when I see \\"by Terry Pratchett\\".<br /><br />We're both huge Pratchett fans... but of course, I've never seen him write a picture book before. I am intrigued. I open it up.<br /><br />I am laughing from the first page. The laughs get harder and harder as I progress. By the time I get to -- well, a certain city ruler, I have to sit down on the floor of the bookstore because I'm laughing too hard to stand up.<br /><br />What an absolute treasure. In addition to being the funniest thing I've ever read, it's a fantastic children's book that rings true for any parent. My son loved it, and being ten, of course he's not read Pratchett... yet. We're starting him with Guards! Guards! this summer.<br /><br />Needless to say, we purchased the book right then, and we're ordering more copies for friends. My only qualm is that I know some people who aren't versed in Pratchett, and will therefore not get it. I'm pushing them to start reading now in preparation for \\"Where's My Cow?\\"<br /><br />Terry Pratchett, you are the MAN.
B0000AOV85|5.0|First I want to say that the Eagle Rock series Classic Albums is sheer quality. I have several of these DVDs and I have not been disappointed. I think this one is the best one so far (probably because Dark Side is my favorite album). Anyway, this DVD gives great insight into the writing, recording, and producing of Darkside. It has interviews with all the members of the band and Alan Parsons. There is a crap load of bonus material. If you love Dark Side and you are even remotely interested in what is involved in the creation of a brilliant album than this DVD is an absolute must. I have watched this one more than once simply because there is so much information to absorb and it is extremely interesting. Oh by the way avoid the hacky Wish You Were Here documentary, it is not part of the Classic Albums series and it is not from Eagle Rock.
B0000028WD|4.0|This album is really recommended for Dylan's fans, yet I have to say that some of the artists, including Dylan himself, didn't perform like I have expected.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|I'd been curious about this film for a while, and after seeing it I can honestly say that it exceeded all my expectations. This film explores the rich, complex emotional lives of a variety of characters. While superficially the characters are all very different (straight, gay, partnered, single, rich, poor, etc), what they all have in common is that they're all at a crossroads in terms of their sexual behavior, and how it either helps them to connect with other people and their own true selves, or not. To quote one of the actors in the film from the (excellent) documentary in the special features section of the DVD, the sex is really just a metaphor for something else. \\"Shortbus\\" is a deep, joyous, cathartic and beautiful film.
B0000C7PSW|3.0|Although I love Rufus' voice, I think this CD is not than good. <br />\\"Want two\\" and \\"Poses\\" are much better
B000PT6OY2|5.0|I own this one and gave it a five star. Everything in the film is great except the card game and not using my favorite actor Jeffrey Wright a LITTLE more.  Take the card game out and use Jeffrey Wright more and it becomes better than a five.  But I'll still give it the top score because everything else in the movie is great.  Love the black and white stuff at the beginning.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I have to say, after waiting some time for another album to appear, it has finally arrived and it does NOT disappoint!  RUSH always seems to out-do <br />themselves with every album they release.  I am not bias either, they are the greatest Canadian group around.  If you were a RUSH fan before or never even heard their stuff before, after listening to this album you sure will become a fan.

1596912855|2.0|This book is a total dissapointment!  It could have been really good, but it is lacking in essentials that would have provided a memorable trip to the era of Jane Austen's characters and world.  The premise is that, thru a bequeathment, a young American woman gets a 3wk vacation to Austenland in England, where she will dress, eat, and live as the characters in Jane Austens day would have.  Sounds like a good plot, eh?  But the problem is that Austenland is simply not fleshed out enough. There is only one other guest there while our Jane is spending her 3wks there.  And the other person is in her 50's.  It would have been a much better read with several more guests at the \\"resort\\".  Even some paying gentlemen in search of an Elizabeth Bennett, perhaps, to counter the women searching for their own Mr. Darcy.  <br /> <br />Even if the two women in the story had been compatible, the story could have had more depth.  But they are different in every possible way, and do not interact any more than they must during their stay.  If there were an Austenland and I paid my good money for a Regency adventure and got stuck with someone old enough to be my mother, and silly and boring too boot, I would have asked for my money back and gone home!! <br /> <br /> There is very little discriptive writing to make the day to day adventure at Austenland enjoyable reading.  Very little about the meals, except dinner, and it becomes routine.  Cursory details of the rooms, the grounds, the overall plan by the owners of Austenland of what the entire adventure is supposed to accomplish. You would think that professionals who design and run such a place would have events planned for most days of the 21.  With more characters there could have been more visiting, taking tea, walks out of doors with most of those in residence where the plot could have thickened in  delightful and surprizing ways.  But no.  They eat, they sit, they read, they do a bit of needlwork and only occasionaly does much ofanything transpire.  <br /> <br />Do we, who love Jane Austen, find the day-to-day doings of any of her characters dull as dirt?  Certainly not! <br /> <br />Then the author throws in a dirty old man scene, for what purpose, I still can't figure out, but it was distastefull, to say the least.   <br /> <br />I felt this story started off with a great story line, but it seems the author got as bored writing it as I did reading it.   <br /> <br />
1401359418|2.0|Though based on academic research, this book has the kind of self-help pop psych style that I personally find extremely annoying.  It compares people who self-describe as lucky or unlucky, and shows this is associated with a range of other aspects of positive or negative attitudes to life. Well duh. Their concluding principles? Maximize chance opportunities, listen to your intuition, expect good fortune, see the positive side of misfortune.  Is this an improvement over fortune cookie philosophy?
067960085X|5.0|The late novelist John Gardner said that an ideal fictional story invokes in the reader an unbroken, fictional dream.  I like this way of thinking about reading a novel or short story.  If you keep \\"waking up\\" during the reading, then the author isn't doing his job very well.<br /><br />I just read Breakfast at Tiffany's--not 30 minutes ago--and I'm still not sure I'm fully \\"awake.\\"  Holly Golightly, the focal character here, seems so real to me, I can hardly believe she isn't in New York, this moment, missing her door key.  Very few novels have affected me this way, this strongly.  A Catcher in the Rye--that one did it.  Jane Eyre, a few others.  If you read, as I do, primarily for company, to share the company of fascinating \\"people,\\" I think you'll love this little book.<br /><br />Truman Capote was one of America's most gifted writers, and in this story, he not only brings his characters to life, he brings this New York City neighborhood, in the 1950s, to life as well.<br /><br />A magical, unforgettable read.

This is the first Deep Purple CD I have owned and I got this one because it seemed to have all their hits on it and also becaus I think it was the only one that has \\"When a Blind Man Cries\\", which to me, is an incredible song.  My 12 year old son loves the CD too and we have listened to it every morning this week while in the car driving to his school.  People are very surprised to hear a 12 year old saying he loves Deep Purple! <br />
1932100660|5.0|A great META-ANALYSIS of an enormous amount of PEER-REVIEWED research. People who argue that the statisitcal analyses of all of the research he cites is weak...needs to re-read the book. Also, meat and dairy eaters may argue that a vegan diet is not the way to go but I say...look at Americans...do we look good? feel good? live quality lives? The answer is NO! Apply these questions to countries that do not eat a lot of meat and dairy. People who eat a more vegan lifestyle do not look like people who eat meat, high fat foods and dairy. We Americans, for the most part, are a lazy bunch of overweight gluttons. Would it be so bad for every American to give a vegan diet a shot and see what happens? What does everyone have to lose....besides weight? Dr. Campbell just provided the world with an alternative to lying around like a sloth by eating better. Everyone I meet has something wrong with them, sleep a lot, tired a lot...etc. It's disgusting. Read the book and follow the research. Read all 750 references if you don't like just reading 1 book.

B0002858YS|5.0|I have to admit, when I first heard \\"Mr. Brightside\\" back in 2004 I wrote these guys off as new wave copycats devoid of their own creative force. Boy was I EVER wrong!!! Fast forward 3 years later. After hearing \\"Read My Mind\\" from their \\"Sam's Town\\" album and instantly falling in love with it, I went back, gave this album a fair listen from top to bottom and I was blown away. Sure, the influence of 80's new wave with it's blasting bass lines and sonic-filled synthesizers are there, but they've pulled off in such a way that makes this offering fresh without giving the listener a nostalgia hangover. The playing by the band is tight, groovy, and as catchy as an STD in Africa (okay, bad analogy but you get my drift). Brandon Flowers' voice is awesome in the weirdest way. It's pitchy, squeamish and loud at times, but somehow you fall in love with it. Overall, I believe that this album should be considered a modern day classic. Rock on Killers!
B000OCXF0Q|4.0|I think her earlier albums were much better. There's only three songs that I actually like. Don't get me wrong I love Avril's music but this cd is lacking. Her earlier work sounded better and had more heart to it. This album sounds like she made it up as she went.
B000LRY9PY|4.0|This young lady has such a sweet sounding, easy listening voice - I love it.  Her voice is so relaxing and peaceful - totally un-violent.  She warms my heart.  I will be keeping my ear open for more of her talent...
B0000X61VE|5.0|This was the first workout video I ever bought - when I was an overweight out of shape 13 year old. At the time, it was way over my head - so I have to say it's not a beginner friendly sort of workout.  These days I do it all the time - even though it's now 15 years old.  As \\"Celebrity\\" workout videos go - it's very good.  Cindy Crawford leads the video, she's not just there while the instructor leads, and even waves Radu off a couple of times when he tries to interrupt her instruction. (It's actually very cute without being sassy.) There is minimal instruction - which I have come to prefer as I have advanced through higher levels of excercise videos.  Video's that give lots of detailed instruction on form and placement are great - this is not one of them.  You start the workout from the beginning of the warm-up and go straight through to the cool down. She does remind you to watch your allignment, but doesn't go into great detail about what that is. Other revievers have given excellent breakdowns of the sequencing - so I won't.  There are short water breaks, which is really nice because you have the feeling of working out with her instead of having to miss a little bit of the workout. It is more toning based - which is what the title indicated - it's a shaping video.  There is a little cardio benefit, but it's not the main focus of this video. The second workout is my favorite because of the long ab sequence. The \\"leg flinging\\" mentioned in the editorial review is actually very effective strength training for the legs which maintains flexibility and elevates the heart rate at the same time - it's similar to excercises I've done in dance classes and seen my husband do for martial arts.  Overall, this is a great workout, there are lots of us who still do it even after all these years.
B000002UEB|5.0|This is the greatest begining to end disc I have ever owned.  Queensryche opened for Metallica on this tour and played Operation Mindcrime from start to finish sorry Metallica bad move.  It was and still is the best complete disc I can think of.  AC/DC has \\"Back in Black\\" Pink Floyd \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" Rush \\"2112\\" but Mindcrime is still on top.
B000GY729M|4.0|Look, this album is no Hot Fuss, so I wish that people would stop comparing it. I mean do you compare Led Zeppelin I to Physical Graffiti??? No. It's the same band folks, just on a different path ---- and that's certainly no reason to write the whole album off. Besides, it wouldn't be right if they went in and simply made \\"Hot Fuss 2\\". That's not what GREAT bands throughout rock history have done, unless were talking about Metallica or AC/DC, which have earned the respect to do so. <br /> <br />There are many good tunes on this record --- of course, \\"When You Were Young\\", \\"Bones\\", and the hauntingly beautiful \\"Read My Mind\\". The album was worth purchasing for the later of those songs alone. Even so, the remaining of the album is still enjoyable and of great quality. For all the haters (who are more than likely disgruntled 90's alt. fans)--SHUT UP!!! This is a good album and worthy of appreciation.
1582701709|5.0|The title should really be \\"The Truth\\", or \\"The Law\\".  The problem with the hard back is that it is physically to small, and the paper is to reflective to be read comfortably with a lamp.  The small size of the VERY STURDY BOOK makes it hard to hold open comfortably.  But the truths contained in the book are remarkably \\"spelled out\\" and the \\"Sumaries\\" are effective in the application of the truths.<br /><br />Dan Rush<br /><br />Oakland, CA
074356619X|5.0|I made this purchase because my daughter recommended it to me.  At first I thought it was a bunch of hype, but after listening to it a second time realized the thought process behind this is linked historically to the teachings of the Bible and God's promised blessings.  I think even a non-believer will develop a spiritual sense after listening to these cds.
B000005JA8|5.0|I have loved this album since the days of vinyl, back when I was in High School.  That said, it is the only album I have ever owned which evinces groans and sounds of vitriolic hate from unsuspecting listeners.  I imagine that its the same response Coltrane got from the lady who screamed \\"ENOUGH!!!\\" in agony while Coltrane was soloing at the Village Vanguard. <br /> <br />MORAL OF THE STORY: One person's beautiful music is another's wretched noise.
1594489505|5.0|Absolutely amazing. Horrifying in many parts, while touching and exhilarting in others. I officially can say this is the best book I've ever ever read.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|This was a great movie, containing a segment from almost every genre known to man.  I loved it.  The best parts for me were the fighting scenes, where the action is choreographed to be almost a dance.  Most prominent in this movie is the comedy...after the first 5 or ten minutes...that had me laughing all the way through.  Though there was a lot of fighting, it was light on violence.  I would recommend this movie to viewers at least ten and up.  Totally.
0374105235|5.0|As the many other reviews before mine sure say, this read takes you through a difficult road, much unknown to most of us.  Mr. Beah overcame many troublesome situations and I commend him for being \\"human\\" enough to finally grasp the difference between right and wrong.  His story is one of many, most of whom go untold...sadly.  It portrays human nature at its best.  It is about survival, at least at first, then the wickedness of life takes over, as drugs engulf the author in a stupor, and lead him to behaviors he dares not dream about for the remainder of is life.  I am glad Mr. Beah made it out alive.  I am sad for the many more who remain there, trapped by a system that promises no future to a population bound by its traditions, that will stay and either fight, or die.  This is a great read.  It tells about a broken system, but most of all, it reaches out to all of us who get so frustrated with the mundane things in life, when the Mr. Beahs of Sierra Leone are walking along rainy, dirt paths, RPG rauncher stapped to their back, AK47 in hand, in an oblivious state of Marijuana bliss, painfully unaware of what awaits them around the next corner.  Mr. Beah's read tells us what...death, either theirs or the others, but either way, someone dies.   <br />Enoy this book, it makes you realize how lucky we are,a nd how sad others like us, with no choice of their own, are forced to make unthinkable acts they will forever run away from in their dreams! <br />Thanks Mr. Beah.
160096527X|5.0|Chesterton was regarded as being a genius at seeing the obvious. Here again, I am in awe of his talent for presenting a sequence of proof, with clarity and sense, which was hiding in plain sight. His writing may be old fashioned by today's standards; but then, so is having standards in the first place. He writes precisely and with true emotion. Reading this book is an improving experience on every level; especially those levels that count.

B00000JPYQ|5.0|One of the finest, if not THE finest array of live recordings ever created. If there were ever a live album that pinpoints the pinnacle of a band's career, this is it. After hearing this, it is difficult to imagine UFO without Michael Schenker. The album showcases most of the classic UFO songs well known to fans in extended form, with some additions since the original release in '79. However, the star of the show here is Schenker, whose flying V is on fire with each solo. For example, check out the guitar work on \\"Rock Bottom\\".  This is intense stuff...not for the faint of heart. Highly recommended.
B00003CXCT|5.0|No, I don't like the changes that have been made to the films. But they are at least 95% intact and are still the defining movies of my generation. The themes of good versus evil, the underdog versus the technologically superior enemy, the young hero who rises from being nothing to changing the course of history- are timeless. These movies will still be loved a hundred years from today.

1400032717|5.0|The book I read was The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time as made famous by Mark Haddon. The book is about a boy with autism who finds a dead dog on his neighbor's lawn. The boy's name is Christopher John Francis Boone and he is a very interesting boy with many strange habits. He likes to count the cars he sees on the way to school. He also has a habit of going off topic a lot. <br />   Christopher is a very smart boy. He knows about space, quadratic equations and he is very good at logic puzzles. He also knows all the prime numbers up to 7057. The problem is that Christopher can't understand human emotions so he doesn't respond to people in expected ways.   <br />This is a very good book. When you read it, it makes you feel many different emotions. You hate his dad one minute and the next thing you know you feel sorry for him. One example is when his dad tells Christopher that he can't write a book about the dead dog. But when you find out why he can't, you begin to feel sympathy for what Christopher's dad is going through. I really liked this book. If you don't like bad language, don't read this book because there are a lot of bad words. The father swears a lot at Christopher because he is frustrated with him. If you like books about dead dogs and people with autism then you'll love this book.

0143038419|5.0|I enjoyed Gilbert's book, but am perplexed at some of the negative reviews.  It seems to me that many of the issues voiced had more to do with the readers than the author.    For all those jealous people who thought she was pampered and \\"lucky\\" because she hit the road with a book deal in hand, let me remind you that she had written three books already.  She earned that advance.  If you write several books that are well enough received that a publisher is willing to bet on you then you too, can spend a year traveling and then many grueling months churning out a readable manuscript.    For those who were angry that she had deep enough pockets to take a year off - I'm fairly certain that if most of you sold your house, your car(s), your furniture, etc. then you would also have enough to rent a small apartment in Rome and live on an Ashram for a while.  If you read Ms. Gilbert's biography then you will know that she is a seasoned traveler and that most of her experiences have not been from the top end of the food chain.    For those who objected to her opinions and her voice - it's a memoir.  It's supposed to have a voice.  If it didn't then you'd be clamoring twice as loudly that it was bland and boring.  If you want straight reportage, read the NYT.    For those few Republicans who slammed down the book for page 48, it was a joke.  Get a sense of humor, please.    For that one absurd comment that she must be an alcoholic.... I do not know Ms. Gilbert personally.  I can say that she was relentlessly honest about everything else (from mucous lakes to [...]), so there is absolutely no reason to believe that she would not have admitted to that if it were indeed her failing.  Alcoholics do not join ashrams where there is nothing to drink.  But perhaps that one reader is hypersensitive to the issue for a reason?    And if I may be allowed one final observation - she was unerringly positive about everyone she met.  This may have been her only serious(though to my mind, quite endearing) untruth. I'm sure she met a number of unpleasant people, and I'm sure at times even the people she wrote about were less than perfect in real life, but she passed on only the best of everyone.  For that alone I like her very much.  It's easy to make fun of other people (Bill Bryson) or to cut them down (Paul Theroux).  The only person Elizabeth ever does that to is herself.  How many of those bilious readers could say the same?
B000002UAU|4.0|...and who'd think people would still be not only listening to, but also ardently talking about, what is considered the Beatles' masterpiece?  For the record, and speaking as someone who was obsessed with the Beatles all through his tortuous teenage years, I think the band's true masterpiece was either [[ASIN:B000002UAO Rubber Soul]] or [[ASIN:B000002UAR Revolver [UK]]], and even though \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" is in places somewhat dated, the darn thing still holds up remarkably well.  After giving it a spin just now (I hadn't for a long while), I can humbly report that it still sounds like nothing else out there, including its numberless imitators ([[ASIN:B00006AW2M Their Satanic Majesties Request]], I'm looking at you!).<br /><br />It's still worth noting the historical context, at least as far as the band was concerned.  The Beatles quit touring altogether in '66, and in effect became a somewhat loosly-knit arts \\"collective.\\"  As more than a few biographers have noted, in the aftermath they basically went in seperate ways.  John became a hipster butterfly, dabbling in radical arts and politics (along the way running into a certain Japanese artist).  Paul looked to the past, immersing himself in the English music-hall traditions so beloved of his parents (and perhaps nostalgic for a time when fighting a war was still a noble effort?).  George studied Indian music and mysticism, learning more about the sitar and Hinduism.  Ringo painted his house.  So when they all reconvened at Abbey Road to record a new album, they all had different elements (not all of them pharmaceutical) to bring with them (incidentally, it was also around this time, in the same studio, that a somewhat more \\"avant-garde\\" band was recording [[ASIN:B000002UA0 The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]]--some can see the influences running both ways)).  The resulting album, though not altogether revelatory, is still a great piece of popular music.<br /><br />--The opening title overture, and indeed the overall conceptual nature of the album, was Paul's idea.  He wanted the Beatles to be re-invented, his first attempt for them to \\"Get Back\\" to the comradery of the past.  For, Paul, the present was all about the past, anyway.  George's acid-rock guitars on the opener was perhaps an attempt to drag things forward.<br /><br />--\\"With a Little Help From My Friends\\" is another of Paul's reveries, this time sung by Ringo (\\"The one and only Billy Shears...\\") so no one is left out.<br /><br />--\\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\\" is the most dated moment on the album, even though it's brilliant in many ways.  John denied it was about LSD (please note the initials) but of course it couldn't have been written otherwise.  Even if it's not about a drawing of young Julian, today it oddly enough sounds a bit like a lullaby.<br /><br />--\\"Getting Better\\" is one of the last true Lennon/McCartney collaborations.  Paul the optimist sees a rosy future while John the cynic lightly mocks him (\\"...it can't get much worse...\\").<br /><br />--\\"Fixing a Hole\\" was thought by moral scolds to be about heroin (it's not), but continues the Lennon/McCartney Yin/Yang to fine effect for a song about societal alienation that isn't just a product of it's time.<br /><br />--\\"She's Leaving Home\\" is Paul's dismal but poignant portrait of \\"modern\\" family life.  Both the parents and their runaway daughter are given equal emotional weight, even if the parents seem to make more sense (the girl leaves just so she can have fun?).<br /><br />--\\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\" is another of John's lysergic fantasias, and it benefits from not being as over-analysed as \\"Lucy.\\"  Many years later, the Elephant 6 collective (the Apples in Stereo, Neutral Milk Hotel) would use this song as a virtual template.<br /><br />--\\"Within You Without You\\" started off side two of the album (please consider buying the vinyl edition if you can) with George's full immersion into Indian music and thought.  It created the mercifully short livedgenre of \\"Raga Rock,\\" but by itself it's one of the most different-sounding pieces on an album of distinctly-different songs. (Try to find a cover of this song by Sonic Youth if you can)<br /><br />--\\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" was written when Paul was about 25.  Now he is indeed 64 (going on 65!) and going through a vicious divorce from a reality-TV star.  Irony, man, irony...<br /><br />--\\"Lovely Rita\\" is the weakest song on the album, ant it's not helped by the psychedelic freak-out towards the end.  I find it tolerable mainly because I heard it about a trillion times during my formative years.<br /><br />--\\"Good Morning, Good Morning\\" is an uncharacteristically upbeat tune from John with one of his strongest vocals and an energetic horn section to boot.<br /><br />--The reprise of the title track brings the concept of the \\"concept album\\" full circle, and thus it's been imitated by most concept albums since then.  It's mainly notable for the way it leads directly into...<br /><br />--\\"A Day In The Life\\"--perhaps the most over-analyzed song in rock history, it started out as two different song fragments from both John and Paul that just stuck together in a fit of inspiration.  One can only imagine the looks on the faces of the full orchestra when the lads (and producer George Martin) told them to \\"just play anything...\\"  Yes, it is quite brilliant but I'm convinced that it was so by accident instead of grand design.<br /><br />So there you have it.  I'm glad I went back to the album, even if I was mainly inspired to do so because of the big round number it has aged to as of this writing.

This, however, is probably no accident, since \\"Pepper\\" has virtually fathered other great albums, including [[ASIN:B0000019PA In the Aeroplane Over the Sea]], which is actually even a bit better.

0446310786|5.0|I recently read &#34;Mockingbird, A Portrait of Harper Lee&#34; and vowed to reread the novel.  After so many years (a lot of water under the bridge) I found that Nelle Harper Lee's words have lost none of their shine.  Her style instantly transports you to childhood with all it's innocent abandon, conflict, tears, fears and hope.  It is a story everyone can relate to in some way: If you can't relate to Scout then you darn well wish you did.  If you didn't have a brother like Jem or a father like Atticus, well . . ..

Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" album, nothing would ever be the same again in this planet, or at least nothing would \\"sound\\" the same.<br /><br />The truth is that the Liverpool quartet revolutionized the music industry standards in vogue at that point, with the release of a conceptual album which modified - among many other things - the simplistic format of the \\"single\\" album replacing it for a more daring experience of multiple tracks on vinyl - \\"Sgt. Peppers\\" showcased a total of 13 songs. In addition to this major leap, \\"Sgt. Peppers\\" would introduce novelties such as fancy artwork for the cover, printed lyrics of the songs on the inner sleeves, a cut-it-yourself inlay with Sgt. Pepper's chevrons & other band related memorabilia, and of course the most recent hi-tech recording techniques available at Abbey Roads Studios.<br /><br />The depiction of the Beatles as the \\"Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" was perhaps the ground-breaking concept which raised the bar on rock and roll from being a simple rustic musical style to becoming an outstanding form of media capable of establishing complex relationships with its audience as well as influencing their behaviour. From this point on, subsequent generations of bands would make use of this peculiar style of composition. Notorious examples range from The Who's 1969 Opera-rock \\"Tommy\\" to Pink Floyd's landmark 1973 \\"The Dark Side Of The Moon\\", both of which have developed their song writing on recurring themes and motifs as to establish a conceptual framework for their songs.<br /><br />The \\"Sgt. Peppers\\" album also gave consistency to an on-going avalanche of high caliber albums by other rock n'roll bands which were also surfing the hazy waves of musical psychedelia in 1967 - during that year rock titans such as The Jimi Hendrix Experience, The Doors, Jefferson Airplane, The Velvet Underground, and The Rolling Stones all released mind-altering works.<br /><br />The music of \\"Sgt. Peppers\\" was heavily synesthetic in nature. At the apogee of the psychadelic movement, songs such as \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\" and the homonymous \\"Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" were crafted with the use of sound textures and motifs which could arguably be touched, seen and even if the listener was daring enough smelled. In other words, these songs were so heavily influenced by the sorrounding beatnik/hippie \\"flower power\\" aura that they were themselves an open door leading to the expansion of the senses. These interlaced sensorial experiences were achieved mainly because of the Beatles' ingenious musical ability. John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr were a breed apart in the select hall of musical geniouses, and their vein for musical experimentation, together with their avant-garde vision for the development of innovative ideas were accurately captured on magnetic tape at Abbey Road.<br /><br />As impressive as it may seem, the 40th anniversary of \\"Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" only proves that the band's ahead-of-their-time thinking was capable of producing an atemporal classic which will continue to echo throughout the coming of ages.<br /><br />***** FIVE STARS - AN ATEMPORAL CLASSIC!g of ages.  <br /> <br />***** FIVE STARS - AN ATEMPORAL CLASSIC! <br />  <br />

038073186X|3.0|This book has a good story in there, but as many others have said, it all takes place in the last 50-60 pages. The worst thing about this novel is that it takes so long (at least halfway through the book) for ANY real action to happen. The author may have intended to gradually build up to a climax, but he takes so long about it that he runs the risk of readers getting fed up with trivial, repetitive, seemingly meaningless dialogue and pitching the book before they get to what the story is really about. The dialogue, intentionally or not, is also very badly written and I would have quit except for the reviews that said the ending was worth it. One thing the author does well is the mixing of real and fictitious places and events. There really is an island in Boston Harbor with a Civil War fort (supposed to be haunted), another with a historic lighthouse. The Cocoanut Grove fire in 1942 is still the worst nightclub fire in U.S. history, with almost 500 people killed. The owner was charged with homicide and spent time in prison. There is a small memorial at the site. The hospital in the book is fictitious, but probably a lot of the techniques are not. It's too bad the author didn't do a better job with this book's structure. Most of the plot twists and the good stuff came way too late.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|This is such a great album.  There's not one dud song on it.  The only one that doesn't stand up as strongly as the others is Gunning Down Romance, but all the other tracks could easily have been released as singles.  Savage Garden were the best thing to come out of Australia in a while.  It's so sad they broke up after only two albums.  They could've gone on to do so much more.  Unfortunately Darren Hayes's solo efforts never came up to par although I was hoping that he would be the 'continuance' of Savage Garden.  The songs are just bland pop, even though he does have a great voice.  It would seem he needs Daniel to write a good song. Plus I'm still peeved at Darren for being gay. How dare he mess with our psyches making us think he liked girls!  But anyway, I digress...Affirmation is pop at its best.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Not only the photography, but the stories that it told were amazing.  It gave us a whole new insight and appreciation of this planet we call home.  It also serves as a warning of how important it is to preserve these strange and mystical regions of the world, so future generations will be as amazed and awed by their existence as we were.  A truly 'Fantastic Voyage\\".  Thank you to everyone that contributed.
1400097029|4.0|At the start of the book you wonder if Max Morden, the protagonist, ever went anywhere or met anyone he actually liked.  His descriptions of locales and people all seem unkind and harsh.  Even the description of his youthful crush is raw.  However, by the end of the book you find yourself almost liking the man and thinking maybe this is someone you could spend time with. <br />John Banville writes an extraordinary novel and weaves a world so real you can almost smell the ocean and hear the waves.  It is not a happy-ever-after story, however it is a redeeming human story and well worth reading.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|Hybrid Theory, although short, was simply brilliant. Meteora try to recapture that magic and was quite good overall. This new release, Minutes to Midnight, just doesn't make any sense.  <br /> <br />When legendary producer, Rick Rubin, came on board I figured that he would take them to new heights. Longer, more complex tunes, and maybe a bridge or a solo here and there. But this was not to be. Balllads, ballads, and for something different.... we get MORE BALLADS. <br /> <br />Each song on its own is listenable, I guess. Overall this highly-polished mellow fest is NOT what we want to hear from LP. I'm sure that over the next five years well have to endure a few remix, mash-up versions of this CD, and maybe they'll get their act together when their new one hits in 2019.
B0009IOR6Q|4.0|This movie holds a special place for me. The fact that my grandpa in the 50's lived in Baltimore and he was a Drape! That man had alot of wild stories. Drapes as John Waters talks about was a gang in Maryland and term used for juvenile delinquints. Suffice to say I often wonder if John and my grandpa ever crossed paths. In fact the character Crybaby is alot like my grandpa he was white trash, he'd been to juvie, he rode a motorcycle, had a leather jacket and a greasy ducktail. He used to swipe cars and get into fights. He also was a musician with band called Rich Rocket and the Automobiles. It was a Rockabilly band he did a song called \\"Shaking my Dice\\" a euphemism for you know what, after watching a film warning about the solo act him and his buddies came up with this song as a joke. My Grandpa said they did a 45, the flip was a cover of Jerry Lee Lewis' \\"Great Balls of Fire\\" they pressed copies only for the band and after he died I looked all through the attic to find it to no avail I was pretty pissed and sad. His stories and bravado made me want to be a Drape and Rockabilly greaser.  Your probably wondering what this has to do with the movie. Alot, when I was a kid me and my grandpa watched this movie in theatres. He snuck me past my parents who wouldn't let me ever set eyes on a John Waters film. I had a good time and so did my grandpa. He thought the movie vulgar and little stupid because he had become a born again Christian but overall I saw that gleam in his eyes and he said it brought back memories. This movie is hilarious and some of the music in this film is really hokey and corny. The Rockabilly stuff is pretty good since Rockabilly veterans Dave Alvin and James Intveld worked on those numbers. Its pretty surreal and crazy overall it is a mind trip and a delightful one. My grandpa if he was alive would recommend this movie. The DVD has interviews with John Waters, the cast and crew. Waters talks in length about the real Drapes which I found interestingand there is commentary. Some of the musical numbers could've been done a little better, but all in all as my grandfather said after leaving the theater with a smile on his face: \\"Swell, pretty swell.\\"
B000OCXMAE|4.0|Linkin Park were in a bind when this album was made.  While they didn't want to lose their core audience, they were limited to the sound of rap metal, which hasn't been successful in radio for quite a while.  As such, they needed to find something new.  Enter minutes to midnight.  This album shows Linkin Park both growing and falling behind.  Linkin park try many different things, slower more melodic sounds, and harsh and biting numbers, with many in between.  The trouble is, many times, Linkin Park where there influence on their sleave.  Try listening to Shadow of the Day, without thinking of Joshua Tree era U2.  Or better yet, No more sorrow, which feels so much like early Metallica, I started head banging.  That beind said, there is a lot to like.  I like Linkin Park trying to mature, and I like them experimenting with different versions of sounds.  This could be either the start of something great, or the first step towards their demise.  Only time will tell.  Regardless, I'll be blasting Bleed It Out while I wait to see.

0307155102|5.0|I am twenty-five years old, and my first copy of this book was very old and tattered when I read it in the early 80s. I still have and treasure it, but I am looking forward to buying a new sturdy copy to give my son (now six months old) before long. This was hands down my favorite picture book as a child, and even now, every time I pick it up, I wind up mesmerized by the pages and studying every single picture before I put it back down. I'm so pleased now that my son is here, so I have an excuse to read it again without looking silly! <br />
B000P2A256|4.0|I have to say I was blown away how similar this sounds to Duran Duran's 2004 album \\"Astronaut\\" - and in my book that is a compliment.  Dont get me wrong I don't think they ripped them off.  I think they are similar in the fact that they both have a modern pop feel and the production seems similar.  Perhaps that is why I enjoyed this album so much it just had a very nice \\"fun\\" feel to it.  Not as straight forward pop/rock sound from the first album (which was good too).  I think they are progressing nicely as a band.  I hope they are here for the long haul.
B000OCZ0ZO|5.0|I got this for my brother who is a mad fan like myself, and he loves me for it. Ever since LP hit the scene, it changed our lives. Their words and aggressive sound tells everyone's life stories as well as their own. And true the sound changed, but their message didn't, which is why I'm so glad I got a copy of M2M for myself, despite many disappointed 'fans'.  Of course, since last November, I was well aware (unlike those who dissed this album to the ends of the Earth) that there wasn't gonna be the hip-hop/electronica sound that we all knew and loved them for in the beginning, but wow, no one, not even me was prepared for how different this album was, and I for one will say, the truest of the true LP fans will love it all the same. I admit, I miss the old sound, but whatever.  IT ROCKS, IT ROCKS, IT ROCKS!    Oh and to the haters, think on this, but don't hurt yourselves: It's been 4 years since Meteora (I was 15 and 11 months, do the math), a lot happened since then, and they're not the only ones who renovated what they were. And so what they put their 2 cents in on current events? We all should, right?     I look forward to the successes this album brings for them, especially more lives they'll save, because they saved mine.
B000002P2V|4.0|Who Are You? is a good Who. Same old song Had Enogh are good. 905 is the best to me, with the beeps, guitar, drums, lyrics and vocal being some of The Whos best. Sister Disco is still good to listen to. Music must Change is great, good guitar solo. Trick of The Light is real good. Guitar and the pen is underrated. Love is coming Down is one of the worst Who songs'Who are You is one of the most popular Who songs. Who Are you? Is a good farwell to Keith Moon.  <br />
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Possibly his best yet. Even though he is terrific at covering Sinatra classics he seems to have moved away and found his own niche. This CD has a great selection of songs from Eric Claptons Wonderful Tonight to Willy Nelsons Always on my Mind and for good measure a couple of Sinatras thrown in. His talent just grows and grows. Having seen him perform live I have no doubt that this mans popularity will continue to increase, hes a terrific showman, a true professional and he has the ability to laugh at himself which makes him even more appealing. I never have this CD off the player, terrific to listen to when driving. An absolute must for people who like the 60's Rat Pack smoothies. Cant wait for his next one!
0575077859|5.0|What a surprise this book was.  Not being able to find it in America yet, I picked it up in Canada.  It was worth the trip!  Very rarely does a fantasy from a new author have as much depth and polish as this outstanding debut.  Like some other reviewers have noted, the final few chapters were stunningly brutal, but one is left wanting more.  Looks like another trip to Canada is in my near future.
0679783261|5.0|I enjoyed this classic totally.  I thought the way Jane Austen developed the characters personalities was incredible.  I have reread it many times.  I am amazed at how much an author can get across without the overuse of sex and violence (that we see way too much of today).  I have also enjoyed her other works Emma and Sense and Sensibility.  I have not read the others.<br /><br />I have found the Pride and Prejudice movie from A&E with Collin Firth to be one of my favorite movies and I think is an excellent addition to have.  The Annotated Pride and Prejudice is very helpful and enjoyable by David Shapard.  The World of Her Novels by Deirdre Le Faye is also very helpful though at times seems a bit heavy.  It gives you a real feel for the era and thus the settings of the book.<br /><br />A word of caution.  When you enjoy something you don't want it to end.  Of the countless spinoffs of the original I totally disliked one and am in the middle of another.  Mr. Darcy takes a wife is unbelievable and totally devoid of character.  Seems there are sex scenes on almost every page in the beginning.  I grew disgusted.  The account of things from Darcy's point of view by Pamela Aidan has been enjoyable.  I am only half way thru the first book, however.[[ASIN:0307278107 The Annotated Pride and Prejudice]][[ASIN:0711222789 Jane Austen: The World of Her Novels]][[ASIN:1402202733 Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife: Pride and Prejudice Continues]][[ASIN:0743291344 An Assembly Such as This: A Novel of Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman (Fitzwilliam Darcy Gentleman)]]
B00000JRTX|5.0|The real life locations in which this film is set are outstanding from start to finish, a veritable travelogue of \\"secret\\" Great Britain. Many moments work well, especially when the characters begin to show their personalities. Hugh Grant is good (cast as a character that resembles himself) in this film and Andie McDowell was never lovelier. We wish she would appear in more first rate films. The supporting cast is really an ensemble cast and they all do their work very well. The cameo of Rowan Atkinson the bumbling vicar is so good. Father Son and Holy Goat indeed! Holy Spigot, too. What fun. The tender eulogy by John Hannah is one of two of the best eulogies in all of cinema history, the other being in \\"Waking Ned Divine\\". The scene in the rain is also lovely. This movie wears well upon re-watching.
0345477618|5.0|If you are into the behind the scenes of movie making and Star Wars, there is simply no better book written on the subject of how one of the greatest touchstone films of all time came to the silver screen.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Here is my 2 cents on this album.  Last summer when I heard the single \\"Crazy\\"  I INSTANTLY took notice...I was stunned how great it was. <br />And this was playing on commercial pop radio?  I gave the record a chance anyway, and man let me tell you...after the 2nd listen to this disc I was HOOKED! This record is interesting, soulful, edgy, thoughtful, original, and fantastic.  A musical masterpiece.  I can't wait to hear what Cee-Lo and Dangermouse do next. <br />Highly recomended.
B000002J2F|4.0|Released in 1980, this album marked the end of their progressive rock era and showed the band hurtling upwards to mega pop stardom. For many fans the streamlined sound on Duke was very different than albums like Selling England by the Pound (1973) and perhaps to some extent, And Then There Were Three (1978). I have to say that I really like Duke, in spite of my being a hardcore fan of their 1970s output. I think that one of the great things about this album is the fact that the guys in Genesis were writing as a team - this group approach to composition stands in contrast with And Then There Were Three, which was basically a collection of solo pieces. Then there was the music, which still had the sheen of progressive rock all over it, in spite of Duke being a comparatively more pop-oriented album; all good things in my book. I think that of the albums being released by the English prog giants still around in 1980 (Yes - Drama; Gentle Giant - Civilian; Jethro Tull - A) Duke is by far my favorite.<br /><br />The lineup on Duke included Phil Collins (drums; percussion; lead vocals; \\"duck\\"); Tony Banks (acoustic grand piano; Yamaha CP-70 electric piano; Yamaha CS80; Sequential Circuits Prophet 5; ARP Quadra; Moog Polymoog; Roland VP330; Hammond T102 organ; 12 string guitar; and backing vocals); and Michael Rutherford (electric bass; electric guitar; backing vocals). Just by looking at Tony's equipment list, it is clear that this is a pretty synth heavy album - the CS80 was used a lot as well as the CP-70 piano. In terms of the elements of the classic Genesis sound, it is still there, but presented in a scaled back manner. Of course the incredible prog rock workout on Duke's Travels/Dukes End is the exception to this, which features some great playing by Tony. Phil of course shines throughout the album, his drumming as impressive as ever and his vocals in top form.<br /><br />Based on what I have read, the tracks Behind the Lines/Duchess/Guide Vocal/Turn it on Again/Dukes Travels/Dukes End were originally planned to be arranged as a continuous, 25-minute long suite (The Duke Suite). The band changed their minds though, thinking that the other tracks (on Side 2 of the original LP) would have sounded weak in comparison and decided to sandwich the solo tracks in between the individual pieces of the Duke Suite. Speaking of which, the other tracks are really not bad at all and my favorites include Mike's \\"Man of Our Times\\"; Tony's \\"Cul-de-Sac\\"; and Phil's somber \\"Please Don't Ask\\", which is a reference to his (at the time) ailing marriage. In general, the playing, arranging, and song writing are excellent throughout and the tunes feature loads of Tony's gloomy chords; this is not the cheeriest pop album out there.<br /><br />This remastered album comes with all of the lyrics along with the original album cover art.  The sound quality is pretty good too.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good album that finds Genesis quoting from their progressive rock past yet simultaneously looking towards the mega pop stardom they enjoyed in the 1980s; as such, it serves as a nice bookend to their prog rock albums of the 1970s. Highly recommended along with And Then There Were Three (1978); Wind and Wuthering (1976); A Trick of the Tail (1976); The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway; and Selling England by the Pound (1973).End were originally planned to be arranged as a continuous, 25-minute long suite (The Duke Suite).

B0002IQEHI|5.0|A good film and a great film...<br /><br />No spoilers here. Simply mentioning things not mentioned (much) in other reviews, here:<br /><br />The frenetic music as Manhattan traffic is reflected in one of the anonymous AKA boring glass International Style skyscrapers. Hitch's hymn to the worst of modern life. Doreen Lang as Maggie, Grant's cute and long-suffering secretary and their dialogue from the lobby throughout the taxi ride. No hotter love scene anywhere, in any film, ever made, than when Cary Grant ends up at Eva Marie Saint's table in the dining car. Scorching! Grant's line \\"I've never been in Pittsburgh!\\" Hitch loves cars and the juxtapositions of them are fun throughout--some of the best and worst models ever made are clustered in this film. Old Westbury looks nice on film. Jessie Royce Landis' lines in traffic court (\\"Roger, pay the two dollars!\\") and in the elevator (\\"You boys aren't really trying to kill my son?\\").  The auction scene scene. The sunglasses scene. The shaving scene. The female patient's \\"Stop!...STOP!\\" classic double take when Cary Grant appears in her hospital room. The pseudo Frank Lloyd Wright hideout. Every detail is dead on. In Summary...<br /><br />This is without any argument or exception one of the top ten films of all time and Hitchcock's best, bar none.
B000002UAX|5.0|When I was a child and a teenager I got so much enjoyment listening to my poppy crackly copy of the White Album.  When I and the rest of the world switched over to CD's for some reason I never got a copy of it.  My kids are now preteens and finding music that we can both enjoy has sometimes been a trial.  I started singing some Beatles tunes and decided that I had to expose them more to good music.  Now it is with such pleasure that I hear my 10 year old son singing \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" and it is sheer bliss to hear my 13 year old daughter singing \\"Dear Prudence\\" (as that has always been my favorite song.)  This is undoubtedly one of the best albums ever.
B00004RF97|5.0|No need to chronicle the miracle that this vehicle wrought in Kate Hepburn's career, sufficing to say that Howard Hughes bought the rights for her and she took it from success on Broadway to Hollywood gold with tremendous aplomb. She insisted on control of director (Cukor) and co-stars (Grant and Stewart) and her gambit paid big dividends. The rest is movie magic.<br /><br />Hepburn portrays a Main Line divorcee on the eve of Wedding Number Two. Grant is Husband Number One and Stewart is the initially-under-cover reporter there to chronicle `An Intimate Day with a Society Bride' for \\"Spy\\" magazine. Hepburn's character is the one to watch as she grows from a distant goddess to a flesh and blood woman, but it is fair to say that one and all undergo some pretty rooty tooty transformations before The End.<br /><br />Marvelous moments abound--it is playwright Philip Barry's masterpiece, after all. Favorites...<br /><br />Hepburn and Virginia Weidler's send up of the Main Line drawl, complete with the lockjaw pose is dead on--people in Bryn Mawr and Chester County Horse Country still talk like that if you can believe it.<br /><br />Droll moments include the witticisms about South Bend (Hepburn says vaguely, \\"It sounds like dancing, doesn't it?), about Duluth (Hepburn again: Duluth. That must be a lovely spot. It's west of here, isn't it?), of Stewart's friends (\\"Of whom you have many, I'm sure...\\").<br /><br />And Weidler's over the top rendition of \\"Lydia, the Tattooed Lady\\".<br /><br />The witty repartee holds throughout the film, and at one point, perhaps the key moment in the film, Barry gives Hepburn's character Tracy Lord the best line in this or any film, \\"The time to make up one's mind about someone is (pause) never.\\"<br /><br />The ending is one of the three or four ideal wedding endings in film, along with \\"The Graduate\\", \\"It Happened One Night\\" and \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\".<br /><br />P.

B0008ENICU|5.0|Put screen divas Rosalind Russell, Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford on a big budget set and watch them outdo one another. They all rise to the occasion and give among their half dozen personal bests of their careers in this legendary \\"all women\\" film.<br /><br />Claire Boothe Luce wrote the play in the 20s and it was a hit, although it almost missed out being produced because the author insisted that all of the sets and especially the clothes be the sine qua non--ka ching, ka ching. The same holds true for the film, adapted for the screen by Anita Loos, which even has an Adrian fashion show in Technicolor (but WHO wore those cumbersome clothes in real life?).<br /><br />The sets are places where Manhattan Matrons might be found, elegant department and dress stores, one another's bridge tables, trips to Bermuda, dude ranches, limited edition trains, Elizabeth Arden's and smart nightspots. All very well rendered in this outstanding production.<br /><br />Supporting cast members include a caterwauling Marjorie Main, sultry Paulette Goddard, the doe eyed Joan Fontaine, charming little Virginia Weidler and Mary Boland as Flora, Countess DeLave, the much married marriage mill heiress.<br /><br />The break up of Shearer's marriage is told with tenderness, and the viewers long for her to take her mother's advice. But then we would miss out on the changing room confrontation between Shearer and Crawford (the tension was real), the bubble bath disclosures and the nightclub powder room denouement.<br /><br />This is one of the greats.
0452286751|4.0|Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead is excellent when it remains in the realm of fiction - however, you will find The Fountainhead is much more than a work of fiction.  Rand does not seek to trick you at any point in the novel; this is clearly a vehicle demonstrating ideas found in her philosophy Objectivism. <br />     Consider the following conversation on page 22 with her self described \\"can do no wrong\\", \\"human as humans should be\\" messiah figure Howard Roark and the dean of Stanton university, whom has just expelled Roark for having refusing to create imitations of \\"classic\\" architechture.   <br />The dean says  \\"You must learn to understand... everything beautiful in architechture has been done already.  We can only treasure the past. Who are we to improve upon them? We can only attempt, respectfully, to repeat.\\"  The entire conversation was so one-sided that you have no choice but to agree with Roark in denying the dean's statement.  By page 22 half of Rands message (that will be emphasized countless times in the coming 700 pages) is delivered.  Howard Roark does not compromise his ideals, and he listens to his own judgement, as everyone should.     <br />     Although the message is easy to decipher, it is the writing in which it is conveyed which makes The Fountainhead such a great novel.  The descriptions are vivid, the charecters interesting, and the plot surprisingly fast paced considering it spans two decades and 700 pages.  If nothing else, Rand knows how to tell a story, and tell it well.  The book is simply captivating, despite some unneccesary dialogue and a few rough patches in the plot.  Whether you agree with the philosophy behind it or not, you will enjoy The Fountainhead.

I think she decide to change her look and sound due to the ridiculous criticism she recived for the \\"Stripped/2002\\" album.  I though that album was musically geinus.  So that brings me to \\"Back to Basics/2006\\".  I love this album, though it would have done her better to release it as a single album and the drop of two songs.  I can listen to Disc 1 all day long, with songs like: Ain't No Other Man, Oh Mother, F.U.S.S. (which by the way means F**k You Scott Storch), On Our Way ect...

Oh Mother<br /><br />5. F.U.S.S.<br /><br />6. Ain't No Other Man
1401308201|5.0|The book was great! I saw the musical in New York, and was very pleased that I could learn more about it.
1416914285|1.0|This book was set out as a staff favorite at a bookstore I shop at.  The recommendations sounded promising but found this simply didn't live up to what was said about it.  Once you get past the very purple prose and the attempt at incest as a plot twist, it's just a dried up old husk of Star Wars, which is of course a rehash itself.<br /><br />The author seems to have some promise and needs to break out of the done-before trap.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|the set came and was intact and complete - I am very satisfied with my purchase. Friends is awesome.
B00005UKKF|5.0|Unlike today (May 2007), Britney's public image was riding high at this point and her tight clothes, amazing body and sexy dance moves are completely erotic. She is so unbelievably seductive and sensuous!! Her confidence and energy are infectious.  <br />I just have one question: What in HELL is Jon Voight doing here??????? Jon Voight was famous 10 years before Britney was born, for crying out loud. He's an anachronism here. <br />But seriously! Not to mention, his little segment was hokey and silly, embarrassing and painful to watch, and it was a distraction from the substance of the rest of the show. Maybe Britney (or her management) was trying too hard to show her wholesome side. No one came to this concert (and no male bought it) to watch Jon Voight read a story to a little girl. <br />I'm surprised there was no audible booing at that point. I have owned the videotape for some time, but I think the DVD would be even better!  <br />I also strongly recommend her Greatest Hits DVD for sexy alternative versions of some of her videos. <br />
B000MR9D5E|5.0|After watching the series on Discovery, I knew I had to own it.  The photography is amazing, and I learned so much about our world.
B00000I3JM|5.0|A Walk Across the Rooftops....on graduation day.... <br /> <br />1983.  Still timeless, beautiful, melancholy.  IMHO the best debut album of all time.  Still sounds incredible.  A must have for any serious appreciator of pure emotional songwriting....  The follow up HATS is also a must have.  The 3rd album Peace at Last (1996) has some gems (Family Life, Happiness), and their fourth album, High, is in my view their weakest to date BUT... having said that, the bar was raised IMPOSSIBLY high with the first two albums..... <br /> <br />Overall.... essential music for any collection.  A welcome cup of coffee on a rainy afternoon.....
B000GDH9J6|5.0|This movie has some of the best camera work and aesthetic qualities I've seen in a movie of this nature. The starkness of the landscape is captured in such a rich fashion. This film is right up there with Eric Valli's \\"Himalaya\\" in it's treatment of the Himalayas. <br /> <br />The quality of films coming out with Tibet and the Himalayas as their setting and subject has been improving greatly over the past few years. I hope we see much more in the future! <br /> <br />I read a review of the film (I think it was in Phayul) that criticized the film for being guilty of perpetuating an anti-romanticized view of Tibetan life. One of savagery and hardship. However, I'm inclined to disagree, though I can see where one might come to that conclusion. I think the film mainly uses the setting as a vehicle to make a statement about the duality of nature in general and man's place within it, and not just in Tibet. How it can be at once very majestic and beautiful, and yet also savage and unforgiving.
0694003611|5.0|This was my son's favorite bedtime book for over a year.  So by now I have it memorized.  It's a sweet little rhyming book that gets little ones in the mood for bedtime.  We've had the regular size board book which now lives at Grandma's house, and we have the lap edition at home.  I highly recommend!
B000P6YNSE|5.0|i think lost is one of the best tv shows that has been made in a while (possibly the best show ever and i wouldn't be surprised). lost season 3 is awesome, lost season 1 was about surviving and helping the survivors deal with what they've just been through. season 1 ended with the hatch, and walt being kidnapped. season 2 is about entering the numbers \\"4,8,15,16,23,42\\". season 3 is about learning about the others and finnaly the season 3 finale was awesome. what will happen next? what is the significance of the numbers? and who will be killed off?  <br />i wish this dvd would come out sooner (i thought around september or october) but i guess i'll just have to wait until december 11, 2007. <br />if you're a fan of lost buy this dvd when it comes out. everyone that watches lost should know that season 4 starts febuary 2008.  <br />also, be sure to check out the lost video game coming out later this year. <br />\\"we have to go back\\"-Jack Shepperd
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Angelic music.  I never tire of listening/watching it. These women are blessed with incredible talent.
B00007KWHG|5.0|Excellent collection of all the hits.  I really enjoy listening to this cd.
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|These women have voices of angels.  You can't help but be mesmerized by their performance.
B00004RERW|5.0|This is the best CD of Celine Dion !!
B000P2A256|5.0|Love it, love it, love it!!!! Haven't stopped listening to it since I got it. It is a great follow up to a first cd that would be hard to beat! These guys just know how to put a cd together. It has the right mix of groove and moves at a good pace. Even my 4 year old son is singing and dancing to it! It is a must have , if you ask me!
B000NDIAWY|3.0|The first time I popped her debut album into the CD player, I had to listen to the whole thing.  THen listened to it again.  And again the next day.  Simply, Brandi's first album is fantastic.  Unfortunately, where that album was cohesive, this one seems completely unsure of itself.  Perhaps that was the intent, but IMO, you have to take it on a song-by-song basis to get any satisfaction.  I appreciate that the sound is perhaps a little matured, but certainly only sophomoric at best.  I wish that there were more songs on it with the \\"Radiohead-with-a-female-vocalist\\" sound as in the title track.  I'm hoping that the next album will have pulled together a bit better...with better songwriting, maybe?
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Es una de las mejores producciones que he visto sobre documentales, los recomiendo 100%. Imagenes, sonido y produccion es de destacarse. AMAZING...!!!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Great flash. Very powerful for its size. Light weight, which I feel is important on my Nikon D200 which is rather heavy. Tilt head allows easy bounce flash.
B00013RC66|5.0|This movie came to me in perfect condition and I received it super fast.  This is a great suspense movie and it is really cool.  Thank you for such great service!
1582701709|5.0|I had this book read in 2 days.  Easy reading and very enjoyable.  It does make one wonder about life, i.e. our lives.  Combining what it says with what the Bible says, there seems to be a correlation between the two.  The bottom line to what this book and the Bible reveal is to, \\"Do unto others what you want them to do unto you!\\"
0316018953|5.0|When Ed McBain died a couple of years ago it meant that everyone else on the list of awesomely great living police procedural writers moved up one spot.<br /><br />For my money, there was wide gap between McBain's spot atop the list and the number two... which isn't saying that that number two was a slouch. No, Michael Connelly isn't a slouch by any stretch of the imagination.<br /><br />In this roundabout way I'm trying to say that Connelly now holds the spot sadly vacated by McBain on July 6, 2005. Big shoes to fill and he did it again with aplomb.<br /><br />THE OVERLOOK is fantastic!
B000NA2776|5.0|first heard and seen grace kelly on mtv and this song reminded me of the theme song from sigmund and the sea monsters which i watched when i was a kid.  it went: you better run you better hide we gotta keep you out of sight we care for sigmund... which is almost the same way grace kelly sounds. <br />anyway bought mika's cd and been listening to it constantly.
0307346609|5.0|This book is an excellent read. Normally a book this thick would take me two weeks to read. I finished this in four days. <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed it from cover to cover.
B000002J1O|5.0|I consider this album as one of Genesis's best, but strange enough I play it less frequently than for example Trick or Abacab. This is because you have to really sit down and listen to appreciate this masterpiece. Its greatness comes essentially from Steve Hackett, who produced here a few of the best guitar solos in the history of modern music. He never reached this superb level before and after Selling. Hey Steve, where are you ?
0374105235|5.0|If the civil wars in Africa are a mystery to you, this book will educate you very quickly! This is a hopeful tragedy. Perhaps it is exactly what MUST happen in Iraq.
B000002IST|5.0|It is the perfect lounge music - before lounging became popular. Phil Collins had become successful as a solo artist and still blended with keyboard virtuoso Banks and Guitar player Rutherford. Chapeau !
B000O174CM|1.0|God, this movie was one of the worst I've seen in a while.  I wasn't expecting it since it got like, Golden Globes and stuff.  But, it was boring and the music was bland.
B000002J27|5.0|I can't find any weak songs on this record. The first side (on the original record, that is) with the superb array Entangled, Skunk and Mad Man Moon it is almost as good as side 2 of Abbey Road...
0786890754|2.0|I usually really enjoy books like this, but P.S. I love you didn't come together for me. I found the idea of it very interesting, that her deceased husband left her message to open. BUT other then that, all the in-between message opening I found to be sluggish and boring. I don't know if it was her writing style or the story, but it just didn't work. It actually was kind of depressing. I know it must be extremely difficult to get back on your feet again after losing a husband, but now that I think about, is that really something enjoyable to read about? Probably not. It might have been easy to identify with Holly if perhaps you have gone through the same type of loss, but for me it wasn't the best book.
B000067CPX|5.0|This, I think, is the best Red Hot Chili Peppers album. The songs are amazing. If you are interested in the band, consider buying this CD.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|We are thrilled with the Planet Earth set.  I have seen part of the series on Discovery channel but I wanted the DVD set for our library for us and our children (and grandchildren some day!)  It's so amazing that the crew captured so much intense, never before seen footage of our planet, and wildlife.  We really appreciate all the work that went into putting the dvd's together!  It was totally worth the money we paid to have these in our collection.
B00000J7JO|3.0|This CD is alright, but the Red Hot Chili Peppers have some CDs that are much better. It has some really good songs, but I don't like the rest.
B000022TSW|5.0|alright where do i start(by the way this is my moms account)THIS MOVIE IS SOOOOO FUNNY!!!!LOL I LOVE IT (I KNOW IT IS WEIRD A 12 year old boy watched it) plus i LOVE south park the show its soooooo funny i think it is soooo funny how they made sadam and satan gay LOL(come on satan lets f#$k) LOL and the devil sings this really funny song that makes him look like a softy lol i give it five stars!!! get this movie(unless you are one of the really boring people that can,t take a joke....
0440238609|5.0|These books are amazing. Great plots, good characters, good writing for  young adult books.
0060760273|5.0|This little board book and bunny make this package a memory for long time use. <br />Being a classic \\"read me a bedtime story\\", and being the size for a small child to handle, you can't beat Goodnight Moon for infants through kindergarten.  Great package!
B00005MP58|5.0|Really enjoyed this on PBS, and the DVD is even better with the cast and directors insights.  I have most of the remakes of Pride and Prejudice and this one is my favorite.
B000050LY8|3.0|people hated this albulm so much when it was released in 1992 because it dosent have the classic toto sound. although the albulm does have a heavier sound than toto fans are used to it is not all that bad it isdefinitely  not in the same class as toto, hydra, or toto iv those were great albulms but it didnt deserve the bashing it initialy recieved.
B00014NE62|5.0|beautiful story, beautiful people. loved the movie though i have problems with english accents.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I was pleased to get just what I ordered...a quality product and it got to me so fast...well that was amazing...thanks so much.
B00008R9KF|3.0|the sound was difficult especialy with the english axcent. good story.skiped around a bit but was well acted i thought. glad i saw it
0743289684|5.0|If you want an erudite, well-conceived and written explanation of the indoctrination into Islam that is hard to kick and so all-consuming (unlike \\"true\\" religions in many ways) particularly from the perspective of a woman with considerable insight, this book is for you.  It won't explain Islamo-fascism directly, but will get you some distance in understanding the intricacies of the Muslim culture.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
1416909532|5.0|I have really enjoyed reading this book. I read alittle each night especially if I am alittle down at the end of the day or a man has said something that has ticked me off, then I read a few pages and it all makes sense as to why he said what he said! LOL I would recommend this book to every woman that has been through a bad break up or divorce especially DIVORCE!! I love Greg for writing this I could hug him! It is a real pick me up or it is a real wake up call for a woman that could be in the dark as to why men are the way they are or as to why we act like we do with men, it's because He's Just Not That Into You! LOL
B000NA2BEU|1.0|While [[ASIN:B000A59PMO Veronica Mars - The Complete First Season]] and [[ASIN:B000FL7CAK Veronica Mars - The Complete Second Season]] are some the finest television produced in the last twenty years, the third season is so bad that it's almost like watching a different series.  Some characters go so far over the top and out of character that they're unrecognizable while others fade into the background as pale, unentertaining shells of their former selves.  The storylines are weak and cliched, some even offensive in their treatment of rape and social issues.  I recommend you skip season three and save your money for seasons one and two.  Season one especially stands out for its top-notch writing, excellent ensemble cast, and gripping plot.  I still try to get everyone I meet to watch season one.  I do my best to stop them from even knowing season three exists.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I saw WICKED the summer it came out in New York. Unfortunately the day we went it was Idina's day off, but Kristen was there. Idina's understudy, Eden Espinosa, was absolutely brilliant and I couldn't be happier to have seen her. When they went on tour and were in San Francisco the following year we went and saw it again. Once more we saw it with Eden, but this time instead of the background being green in \\"Defying Gravity\\" it was a dark blue hue. They also jumbled up some of the words in the performance. When I say \\"jumbled up\\", I mean they weren't consistent with the lyrics in the soundtrack.....which was slightly annoying...
B000NVIXFK|4.0|I am 33, born in Peru, my brother share Rush with me when I was 8 or 9 years old, since then I am Rush fan. In my teens (late 80') it was awsome to be part of the few bunch of kids that love being a Rush fan, specting every record as a important sucesss, enjoing to know when Neil, Geddy or Alex where nominated as the best players in their respective instrument and learning, yes learning with Neil's lyrics. I own every Rush CD and DVD. <br /> <br />When I bought Vapor Trails I was a little bit scared of what I was going to hear. It really cost me a lot of hearings to be used to this new sound and not having solos or instrumental songs; but little by little I begun to enjoy it and I really love it now. Same happened with Snakes and Arrows, I was really scared about not likeing this CD but I really like it after 3 hearings.  <br /> <br />I think that fans are used to a particular sound and we spect to hear something similar in style to what we like most (I love 2112 and Grace Under Pressure) but they are artists that don't need to copy themselves and (thanks god) they have the right, the will and guts to try new things and evolve. Every musician that matters has evolved just see The Beatles, The Who or Rolling Stones. <br /> <br />I must say that I am still waiting for a new record that completely satisfy me in the first hearing like Roll the Bones or 2112 or Counterparts. I belive that I am much more cinic that when I mas 9 years old or a teenager but I still enjoy every Rush record and I undersatnd that I love not only the music but the memories. Thanks Rush for making that wonderful music and boys, keep giving us more music. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Gore talks repetitively about the carbon dioxide levels on earth. Movie could've been cut down to about 35 minutes
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is educational entertainment at its best.  The naration, photography and subject matter are engrossing, enlightening and, at times, surprising.  I love to watch documentaries that make me say, \\"Who'd a thunk it?\\"
B000NA2BEU|1.0|Man, I loved this show, once. Season 1 was awesome. Season 3, however, is a total waste of time and money, and absolutely not worth buying. The characterizations are hamhanded and juvenile. When and if our favorite characters show up, they are mere shadows of what they once were. The writing is terrible, and the handling of sensitive subjects is clumsy and immature. It's like, when Veronica went to college, Rob Thomas went back to high school.  <br /> <br />Don't buy this. Save your money for better television.
0670888443|2.0|Several things- I don't think it's too hard to borrow off a classic story to try to make a cute book- so I would not go overboard stating this book is super creative. <br /> <br />Another thing- I don't like the language and tone of the book, and just think it's wierd. I know it's a kids boke, and a joke, but it's got odd lanuguage for a kids book...and I promise I am not a super-conservative...but the underlying tone is violent.... <br /> <br />Here for example: <br /> <br />\\"Now I am usually a calm fellow....I go a little crazy\\" <br />\\"And do you know what that little porker answered?\\" <br />(About the 1st pig) \\" he was dead as a doornail, it's a shame to leave a good ham. So I ate it up\\" <br />\\"And your old granny can sit on a pin\\" <br /> <br />I think it's negative, and crass. <br /> <br />I have to give it atleast a 2 beacuase the illustrations are phenomenal though!
B000I5YCCO|5.0|Shopped around and decided to purchase from Amazon. As usual the service was excellent and the product was exactly what I wanted.
B00005JM02|3.0|Finding Nemo is a cute movie for sure. Ellen Degeneress lends her voice and makes is a funny movie. Nemo is vivid with beautiful colors, and again, is cute, but lacks some of the creativity of Toy Story, and Monsters, Inc. The story does have an underlying deep meaning which I can totally appreciate.
0740748475|5.0|I love this series of books, though I haven't finish all of them. So far as I read, I love its humor and word usage. The only defect is the book just too heavy, if it's lighter I think it would be much easier to carry.
B00005JKDR|5.0|For me- The storyline of Monsters, Inc. is the most creative, and imaginative of any of the Pixar films, is better put together too.  <br />What kid won't love the creative and interesting looking monster characters. Most the monsters like Sully turn out to be just sweet and loveable. Billy Crystal and John Goodman are a riot in this movie.  <br />The monsters scare kids because the screams power their city. In the end, their laughter is more powerful. It does not get any more creative and artistic than that. And the humor will have adults laughing too!
B000JU7NCE|1.0|This is the worst Cure release ever.  When you watch this you'll be saying to yourself \\"Where are the keyboards???\\".  It's a shame the band got rid of Roger, he is sorely missed. Bringing back guitarist Porl Thompson does nothing for the band here either. He offers nothing new or interesting and doesnt do any better of a job than recently sacked guitarist Perry Bamonte.  The songs on here are mangled, lifeless and boring. Pick up the Trilogy DVD to truely see the once great Cure live.  Avoid this dog like the plague.
B00005JPLU|5.0|This is the best movie ever.  I'm chomping at the bit, waiting for the release.  Its like video drugs. <br /> <br />Sure its not Casablanca or the Godfather, but honestly, while those are great dramas, and well watched for the content, 300 as a movie is the pinnacle of the action genre.  Its pure entertainment, and will leave you gasping, panting and hungering for more. <br /> <br />If movie companies want to make movies that epitomize a genre, they should look to 300's pureness of spirit as a beacon to light the way.  I can't believe anyone would give this movie less than 5 stars, if judging it for entertainment value alone, which is what movies SHOULD do. <br /> <br />The Academy Award For Awesomeness should be awarded permanently to 300.
B0000028WD|5.0|Any Dylan fan would appreciate the scope of his compositions, especially if done by such an array of artists. Even though this concert is from 1993, the music holds up. New approaches of Dylan songs by the artists just go to show how the songs are timeless. Johnny Winters take on Highway 61 smokes and My Back Pages is the cut that initially caught my interest. You cannot go wrong in purchasing this CD.
1401308201|5.0|Love this book! It is a behind the scenecs look at Wicked. Beautiful photos in a wonderful book.
B0000028W9|5.0|In 1993, the night of Clinton's inauguration, I watched the MTV Rock & Roll Inaugural Gala, and Don Henley did a great set on that program, which was hosted by Dennis Miller.    Henley did some of his old Eagles songs and a few of his solo hits, but when he introduced \\"Democracy\\", written by, as he said, one of the greatest singer-songwriters anywhere, Leonard Cohen, and then went right into the song, I was hooked right away.    \\"Democracy\\" was the most intelligently written song I'd herd in a very long time, and when it opened with \\"Those nights in Teannemmen Square\\"  Leonard Cohen's words had my full attention.   I needed to hear more.    \\"I can't Run no more with that lawless crowd, while the killers in high places say their prayers out loud.   But they've summoned up, they've summoned up, a thunder cloud - They're gonna hear from me!\\" Cohen intones in \\"Anthem\\".  Words that ring through to the present day!    Playful words in \\"Closing Time\\", a Rock & Roll apocalypse in the title track, the raw sexiness of the lyrics, all combine to make \\"The Future\\" a CD I keep going back to over and over again afer all these years.    Years ago I turned a co-worker friend of mine on to the song Democracy,  and later after he died, I put that tape on in my car, and got the distinct sense that he was alive again and riding right there in the car with me, just to hear that song that we both loved so well.    Great work, Leonard!    May your songs be sung and heard for generations!
B000001EEN|4.0|A good listen. I especially liked the live version of Hendrix's 'Little Wing'.  It is way better than the one on the Layla album.  Buy this and enjoy
B000MTPAHW|5.0|I've always been a fan of Steve Mcqueen, him and Paul newman when i was growing up. I'm 23 now and i couldnt be happier that they put this film out on HD DVD. Its not the greatest transfer but for it being as old as it is, its pretty freakin sweet man. I also purchased the Getaway too and that was pretty cool stuff as well. Anyway if you love this film and Steve Mcqueen buy this movie on HD.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|I only own one LP CD - Hybrid Theory, but I think it's great.  I've never been to a LP concert or anything like that.  I heard that LP was going to release a new album and I hadn't bought anything for a while so I said to myself hey the LP album I own is great - let's give this other one a try! Right now Minutes to Midnight has only 3 of 5 stars on Amazon, which is abysmal.  Unfortunately by the time I noticed that I had already told my wife to buy the album and she was already on her way home with it.  So I kept it what with it being a rare \\"gift\\" from her and all.    <br /> <br />I've listened to it all week, perhaps 20 times all the way through.   I hate judging things on first impressions because I've changed my mind about other albums after a few listens -- usually new/different things grow on you after a good 10 or 20 listens if there's any merit to them.    <br /> <br />Here are my thoughts: <br /> <br />1) LP throws the F-bomb into a few songs on this album.  I'm no prude but it is obvious even to the casual listener how awkwardly it is used - it really does give the impression that it was added as an afterthought as if LP didn't like the original lyrics.  It really seems like a case of trying too hard/copping out when they couldn't find the words they wanted. <br /> <br />2) Hands Held High is unbelievably annoying.  Amennnn Amennnn over and over and over.  It is even more ridiculous when you play this album with friends over (as I did) and suddenly they've heard Amennnn 40 times in a row - everybody notices and everybody cringes. <br /> <br />3) Of the remaining tracks, What I've Done is the only track that sounds like it could have been on Hybrid Theory --- which is a good thing!   The problem is that the rest of the tracks are substandard shlock.   I hear Chester, I hear a bit of Mike (neither of whom seem to be trying hard) and you wonder if the 4 other guys even bothered showing up to the studio.   I understand that the consensus amongst fanboys is that this album is just misunderstood and it is supposed to be a more mature sound for LP, but if you're going to go mature you might as well listen to artists who know what they're doing (and understand that the F-bomb isn't the best way to express your new-found maturity). <br /> <br />Learn from my mistake and pass! <br /> <br />
0440237688|4.0|Now Lois Lowry did a great job in writing this book, but it gets a little confusing sometimes. You kind of have to bear down and really think about what she is saying.Overall it was a really good read with some great twists and turns. Imaginative storyline and a painfully familiar way of life to some people. Im not really sure i can relate though. I wouldnt recomend this book to any body under the age of 13 but otherwise anyone would be ok reading it. <br /> <br />-Tg
067960085X|4.0|Like many others here, I was inspired to read Truman Capote's work for the first time after seeing the movie Capote.  I thought that starting with In Cold Blood would be too dark, so I chose Breakfast at Tiffany's instead.  Surprisingly, this orginal work is not nearly as light and cavalier as the famed film version.  Although the movie stuck fairly closely to the actual plot, Holly is a much deeper character than her excellent portrayal by Aubrey Hepburn would suggest.  There are nuances to her story that are completely left out of the on-screen version, including a poignant conclusion that is nowhere near a Hollywood ending.  Overall, however, Breakfast at Tiffany's is an excellent read, at it alone is deserving of a 5-star rating.<br /><br />While Breakfast at Tiffany's is more of a novella, the other tales in this book are simply short stories, and I found them to be much less compelling.  House of Flowers is a sort of off-beat romance, some of which I found to be disturbing and with an ending that I found to be unsatisfying.  A Diamond Guitar was more moving yet quite depressing.  Finally, A Christmas Memory, the best of the three, was a sweet tale of a young boy's special bond with a much older relative.<br /><br />If you are looking for an entry point to Truman Capote's work, this book would be a good place to start familiarizing yourself with this talented, important writer.
B000P2A256|2.0|I have to admit I was really excited for this album. I wondered, after Songs About Jane was such a massive hit, if we'd ever hear from Maroon 5 again after the tour ended. So I was very much looking forward to this release. I was really into \\"Makes Me Wonder\\" when it was first released (still am!), but thought it sounded a little tinny, like a song that had settled for over-smooth production instead of searching for the real heart of the music.  Still, it gave me high hopes for the album, especially knowing how capable this band is of turning out catchy single after catchy single - but now that I've had the album for a week, I am so, so unfulfilled. <br /> <br />I wasn't expecting another Songs About Jane - a band has to evolve, after all, especially after five years off.  But this album just seems to be more of a rough draft than finished product. These songs should have been given more time to develop, more.. oomf.  More heart and soul.  The songs have little drive, less bass, and seem to more mimic old 80's synth-pop than create their own new sounds and rhythms.  It is a great missed opportunity - if anyone could have brought back the sounds of Prince and the like, it would have been Maroon 5. <br /> <br />\\"Makes Me Wonder\\" is still a great song, though, even after extended listening.  \\"Wake Up Call\\" is a fantastically catchy, rock-y song with an oddly dark story to tell.  But the rest of the songs settle in to superficial lyrics with awful rhymes or cliched sayings, and don't have a backing of solid musicality to support them.  Not to mention \\"Kiwi\\", which has to be the single most awkward song about that particular sexual act ever recorded. Come on - the fruit-as-sex metaphor has been done to death.   *skip* <br /> <br />I still think the band has potential, and I still really love most of Songs About Jane.  This new album will still get time in my player, but it's background music and little more.  I just hope we don't have to wait another five years to see what else Maroon 5 can turn out.
B00005JPKE|5.0|This film was superbly done and I agree that it was much better than 'Flags of Our Fathers.' It flowed much better and you actually get to know some of the characters. It's definitely a just tribute to those Japanese soldiers who defended that doomed island and did their duty just like our boys did theirs. Sure there's the significant cultural differences, and you can argue that they started the war, but once those bullets start flying, we all feel the same fear and bleed the same blood. Foot soldiers don't start wars, and only the hardest of hearts could watch this and not feel sympathy for these young men. Another reviewer called this an \\"anti-bushido\\" movie and I think there is some truth to that. One of the recurring themes seems to be the contrast between the common soldier who just wants to survive, and the hardcore bushido officers who believe in nothing less than death before dishonor. Personally, there's a part of me that sympathizes with the whole honor-driven samurai tradition, but I can see how many regard it as primitive and senseless. The cave scene with the grenades comes to mind. I also have to say that the score is one of the most touching I've heard in awhile also. The main theme is one of those pieces that tears at your heart. All in all, this will go down as one of Clint Eastwood's finest achievements.
0618680004|1.0|I purchased this book after reading all the hoopla about what an intellectual approach Dawkins took to a a difficult question. I wanted and expected to be fascinated by his arguments.  <br /> <br />Instead I was disillusioned by his shallow approach. In the preface he listed all the wars the world would have avoided without religion, most of which were the result of far more deeper, often economic, causes. Then he goes on to spend an inordinate amount of time analyzing quotes from Einstein, Thomas Jefferson, etc.to determine whether they were, contrary to public opinion, closet atheists. As if I cared. Actually the more I looked at the quotes, the more uneasy I became with his conclusions.  <br /> <br />All in all a great disappointment.
1400063515|3.0|I was prepared to love this book; I bought it with great anticipation. I got it home and started reading it immediately, but it was so repetitive that it got boring fast. Taleb's thesis boils down to this: social reality will produce a big punch out of nowhere and it will have a big impact, usually negative. Duh!!! Taleb bemoans Gaussian Curves, and normalized this and that; basically he seems to scramble mumbo jumbo in a word soup that is confusing and not very well argued. Taleb seems to be saying that same thing in tortued prose what Spencer Johnson says in very simple prose in Who Moved My Cheese? And Johnson's book is much cheaper. <br /> <br />Taleb tries to explain human decision making but winds up writing confusing explanations. In place of Taleb, I would recommend Gilbert's Stumbling On Happiness. Stumbling is very well and simply written and it's funny. Taleb's tends to take himself a little too seriously at times and he name drops and is a little precious too, and those tendencies make him a little boring to me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B000NVIXFK|3.0|Well, I think something is missing from this record but I dont know what. The sound is good, the musicians are great and the songs...well I dont know. You know, for me the perfect Rush album is the Roll The Bones, Counterparts and Test for Echo. Maybe the great songs missing from this album? I dont know.....
B000NVIXFK|3.0|A Review of Snakes & Arrows <br />by Jose L. Vasquez - Highlands Ranch, Colorado <br /> <br />Rush's new album, Snakes and Arrows, is best described as a throwback.  This is an album that truly hearkens back to the days of early Rush and the power beat of the mid-70's when the hammered out songs led with Geddy Lee's strong Robert Plant-inspired vocals.  The album starts out very promising with the pre-released single \\"Far Cry,\\" combining elements of what has made Rush a very strong band, strong guitar and even a little bit of synthesizer with the sense that the song progresses and takes you to different places.  It's as though the album will be a more melodic version of Vapor Trails.  Wrong.  Something happens as you get to the next track and you realize that this is NOT the Rush that you have known and been familiar with since the days of Presto, Hold Your Fire and what this reviewer considers their best album, Test for Echo.  \\"Armor and Sword\\" is an uninspiring song that plods along and just tries to make its point with heavy guitars.  \\"Workin' Them Angels\\" again takes us back to early Rush and you have the feeling that the next song will be \\"La Villa Strangiato\\".  In other words, gone are the synthesizers and Rush turns to the guitar with a careful blend of electric and acoustic and Geddy continuing to experiment with new vocal ranges.  \\"The Larger Bowl\\" starts out promisingly and the song does caress us with Neil's thoughtful lyrics but leaves me disappointed in the song's predictability and just lack of originality.  \\"Spindrift\\" is one the better songs and bursts through with strong riffs in the manner that many of classic Rush songs provide.  The album provides us with three different instrumentals and, interestingly enough, the best track on the album is \\"The Main Monkey Business.\\"  I didn't care for \\"Hope\\" which was a weak instrumental, certainly too weak to put on an album (it felt like an interlude you might expect to hear at one of their shows while Neiland Geddy are getting drinks and toweling off).  \\"Malignant Narcissism\\" seems to be Rush's tribute to 70's guitar rock and roll music and just good old hard rockin'.  I had a hard time with this.  Two other tracks \\"The Way the Wind Blows\\" and \\"Bravest Face\\" are two good efforts but yet again this not Test for Echo and it's not Roll the Bones.  The one song that reminded me of recent Rush efforts was \\"Faithless.\\"  This song very easily could have been found on Test for Echo as it seems to have the Rush melodies that I became enamored with. <br /> <br />The days of Power Windows, Grace Under Pressure and even Counterparts are distant memories.  I am not sure if it's that the band is undergoing a nostalgiac phase and attempting to re-create the sounds from early 70's.  The band's \\"Feedback\\" album should have been a clue to Rush fans that the band is going back into the Wayback Machine and re-tooling their sound to the old classic rock days.  For fans of classic Rush, this is good news and there will be many happy fans in their late 40's and early 50's that will be revving it up at concert time.  For those fans who were introduced to the Canadian power group by \\"Spirit of Radio\\" or \\"Big Money,\\" like me, it's going to be a little bit of a struggle.  The album shows that Rush is at the top of its game, the sound is strong and the vocals are where they need to be.  But instead of going into a new direction, the ablum is going backwards - a true regression.  I think I'll go give Vapor Trails another listen to. <br /> <br />Comments can be e-mailed to jlvlaw@aol.com

1400063515|5.0|Let's see now:  1.) Unexpected things can happen (in finance, and other areas of life).  2.) They can have disastrous (or sometimes, positive) consequences.  3.) There's no way to predict when or if they'll happen, and after they do, we can't really know why they happened.    That's the book a nutshell. Since #1 and #2 are not exactly news, this book seeks to prove #3 by debunking all systems which claim to be able to predict these rare and risky \\"Black Swan\\" events, especially in the world of finance.     Most of this book is taken up with well-argued and mathematically-based attacks on predictive economic theories and economists, especially overrated Nobel-prize winners (I'll never be quite as much in awe of such people again). Taleb demonstrates again and again how these systems try to predict the future by extrapolating the past -- driving while looking in the rear-view mirror -- and are ultimately doomed to failure.     The real danger, though, is that these theories (based on the Econ 101 \\"Bell Curve\\" or Normal Distribution) unfortunately make unusual events (e.g., market crashes) seem more unlikely than they really are. We're not as safe as we think we are. Of course, after unexpected events happen, there are plenty of explanations as to why they were inevitable. So why didn't anybody say so beforehand?    The author is a colorful and entertaining character. He's certainly opinionated, but his opinions are backed by some serious credentials. He has a Wharton MBA and a PhD in mathematics. He's worked and written with Benoit Mandelbrot, the fractal guru. But he says he's learned more about how the world really works from cab drivers, con men, and in-the-trenches options traders, having spent several decades as a Wall Street trader himself. He hates ties and pompous academics. His advice for dealing with a overly-serious economist: \\"put a mouse down his shirt\\".    As a writer, he takes a deliberately confrontational/contrarian stance, though he also admits his weaknesses and uncertainties. He includes a legion of instructive stories and personal anecdotes, including those of fictional alter-egos, both male (a trader) and female (a writer). He can be annoying and repetitive, but he's nearly always engaging.    I'm left with a lingering disappointment that he doesn't give us much to do with this information. Maybe there isn't much we can do. He offers little in the way of investment strategies (he mentions that his own investment money goes mostly into government bonds -- it works for him, but it's bad advice for the average investor).     But after soaking up Taleb, when I now hear someone earnestly explaining with a straight face why a particular event occurred, a little skepticism bell goes off in my head, and I think, \\"Now wait a minute ...\\".  I'd say that's worth the price of the book.
0515142247|3.0|The review of Lee Child's books keep saying that the books are getting better.  I decided to start the series at the beginning and to work my way through.  Die Trying is number 2 and I do not see any improvement.  In fact I think that this book is a step back.  Others continue to summarize the plot so I will not do repeat the effort.   <br /> <br />I found in Die Trying several long segments that were boring.  The truck ride was never ending and really did not enhance the story.  In addition, the sniper scenes were overly technical.  Lastly as in many thrillers when the writer begins to discuss politics it is too unbelievable. <br /> <br />Putting all that aside, once it is accepted that Jack Reacher is super at all that he does and the reader suspends his knowledge of what is possible the book is very enjoyable.   <br /> <br />I said in my first review of a Jack Reacher book this is the closest to 24 I have ever experienced in print.  I will continue going forward with another installment in a few weeks.

B00005JMUA|5.0|All grown men have a little boy in their heart that still surfaces every now and again...some fellows more so than others, and it's always so much fun to go back.  That is one of the many reasons I enjoy having a son waiting to greet me when I come home from a day of work or a long business trip. On the flip side, Quentin Tarantino gets to go back to being a boy every time he goes to work, and I say good for him.<br /><br />The Kill Bill movies are a potent effusion of likely all the things Quentin grew up with.  Westerns, Kung-Fu movies, Samurai movies and other action films that helped mold and create his robust imagination.  Now, he can take the ideas that inspired him as a child and make them even better for the next generation of action-craving bloodthirsty little children.  Kill Bill volume 2 is more than a derivitive tribute film, it is an elicitation of massive nostalgia, excentuated keenly by incredible dialogue.  Other than function well as a conclusion to the series, it is actually quite different from Kill Bill volume 1 in a few ways.  Kill Bill volume 1 contained mostly introductions, followed by bloody action as Beatrix Kiddo took on and took out Vernita Green, O-Ren Ishii, Go-Go Yubari and of course the Crazy 88 (yes, all 88 of them).  But in Kill Bill volume 2, I felt like those were merely the supporting villains as Kiddo takes on the more resourceful and profound antagonists in this film; Elle Driver, Budd and of course Bill himself.  The sequel, unintentionally perhaps as the two were written and filmed together, possesses more depth than the first part.  There is more room for dialogue and that is of course a great thing because outrageous and unlikely dialogue is one of Quentin's strengths, and it serves here to make the characters even more unearthly and super-hero-like then in the first film.<br /><br />Overall, in volume 2 we get to see how Beatrix learned her skills and we learn more about the relationship between her and Bill.  It all leads up to an often criticized climax between Bill and Beatrix.  Between the dialogue and David Carradine's performance, the climax helped me enjoy this film a bit more than volume 1.  So, if you prefer action and violence you will like the first movie better, but if you just so happen to get caught up in the characters along the way and have an appreciation for the kind of concentrated cultural yearning crossed with mythical level characters that only a Tarantino film can deliver, then Kill Bill volume 2 is a great cap to the two films.  For me, simply put, together they make one amazing movie.ten criticized climax between Bill and Beatrix.

B000KGGLCU|5.0|I adore this Madonna feature of her Confessions Tour. It is filled with incredible talent, both musically and the DANCERS!! Her show team is absolutely amazing.It keeps moving and displays an invigorating image of both spiritual and political flavors.

Just grasping the amount of work and dedication that went into this Tour is awesome. A must see!!!
B000002UAO|5.0|Bob Dylan, the antiwar, civil-rights, Woody Guthrie-imitating darling of the folksingers, the Voice and Conscience of his Generation, after penning \\"Blowin in the Wind\\", stunned his followers with \\"Bringing it All Back Home\\". Electric instruments and a turn from trying to change the world by preaching at it to a bemused satire. This is one of the two most influential albums of the sixties, maybe of music history. I remember.<br /><br />The Beatles were wildly popular with younger listeners, but generally dismissed by music critics of the time as being a wildly sucessful but totally Pop phenominon. Dylan said they were \\"Bubblegum\\". Dylan's friend Al Aronowitz (sp?), said that the Beatles weren't that bad. Dylan and friend were introduced to the Beatles at a certain party in Manhattan AUG 64, wherein there was some smoking & intoxicants, still legal at that time. Dylan and Lennon talked and found they had a lot in common.  Dylan suggested Lennon should put more of his feelings into his songs. Following this party the Beatles became much more introspective, and a few months later \\"Rubber Soul\\". See DVD \\"No Direction Home\\" directed by Martin Scorsese for details, if you don't believe me.<br /><br />Reflecting popular intoxicants of the time, some then legal, the Beatles music changed and changed the course of popular music and culture forever (for better of for worse). This album and their masterpiece \\"Revolver\\" were the watershed events of the sixties. If one carefully looks at the release dates of ALL music before and after \\"Rubber Soul\\" / \\"Revolver\\" one can determine what a sea change this was. Most of the music explosion now associated with the sixties, The Doors, The Mamas and the Papas, Led Zeppelin, Cream, the better Rolling Stones albums starting with Aftermath, Jimi Hendrix, etc etc came AFTER this.<br /><br />Both lyrics and harmonies were much more elaborate than anything the Fab Four had done before. The critics who had been dismissive fell over each other praising.  Other groups covered these songs, overnight, even symphony orchestras.<br /><br />\\"Norwegian Wood\\", despite what meaning other critics have projected into it, is little more than a description of a Lennon one-night stand, a nice tune which seems to suggest more. Harrison plays the sitar. \\"Nowhere Man\\" is an in-depth Lennon existential statement more revealing than anything Beatles had done before. \\"Think for Yourself\\" is a song addressed to a Beatle wife who would soon be divorced. With Paul on fuzz bass. In \\"Michelle\\", McCartney digs deeper into his musing melodies than ever before, talking of the problems of having a French girlfriend and not speaking the language.<br /><br />A number of tunes explore said intoxicants. \\"The Word\\" talks of psychedelic epiphanies into the Nature of Reality they found and the importance of love. \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" points to instant insights the Fab four, esp John, found therein, a vision of looking down from above. \\"Wait\\" points to personal need changes wrought by their acid adventures. But the most heartfelt revelation comes from \\"In My Life\\", where Lennon, who led a pretty unhappy childhood, and supressed it into glib humour, started to come to terms with the changes and losses in his life (like the death of Stu Sutcliffe).<br /><br /> \\"There are places I remember, all my life, but some have Changed. Some, forever, not for better...\\" it was true for him then, it's true for us, now.<br /><br />The acid revolution would mostly start in \\"Revolver\\", but it's roots are here. This is one of the Four Great Beatle albums: \\"Revolver\\", \\"Sgt Pepper\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\". Wall-to-wall great songs, classic melodies you can hum, which burrow deep in your brain and will last forever. This album is less challenging, perhaps, than the others.<br /><br />Rumour has it a better quality remix, which better captures the original LP, is coming.<br /><br />BTW, this is NOT how this album, or \\"Revolver\\", were released in America in the sixites! The songs chosen for both albums changed and didn't come out like this until CD release in the late '87! Another great Beatle song, not included on this album, but from this period, is McCartney's \\"Ham and eggs, oh Baby, I really love your legs\\" or by it's better known later title, \\"Yesterday\\".<br /><br />The music of the Beatles stand up well against the the greatest melodies of the 20th century, even Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, Rogers and Hammerstein. \\"Yesterday\\" is THE most covered song of all time. People, kids, used to line up around the block overnight the day before a Beatles release, to get the first copies in the city! The Beatles will be remembered when all else from this century is forgotten.is until CD release in the late '87!

B000NA2BEU|1.0|Never have I seen a show rest so completely on its past laurels.  Was the first season of Veroinca Mars fine and compelling television?  Yes, it was.  The same cannot be said for the later years, with this final season being the most creatively bankrupt and oddly self-impressed.  Veronica Mars as a show and as a character are unrecognizable here.  Even putting the misogynistic, homophobic and nonsensical storylines aside, Veronica Mars still manages to commit the cardinal sin of all entertainment:  it is boring.  What a sad end to a promising series.
0345494768|5.0|Before the sequels, prequels, special editions and DVD releases there was the original.  The beauty of this book is that it is written from the perspective of the time in which the film was made.  Though this is a new book, much of the material comes from interviews conducted before, during, and shortly after the making of Star Wars in the 1970s.  The information conveyed from this perspective really fleshed out some things I had read previously and also corrected some misconceptions I had from incomplete accounts found elsewhere.  The material here is nearly exhaustive in its coverage.  It also includes many never-before-seen pictures.  The hardcover edition is a hefty well-made volume and has roughly the same dimensions as the book \\"The Cinema of George Lucas\\" published 2 years ago, so the two books look great together on a shelf.  This book truly revives a new, stronger appreciation for just how revolutionary this film was in so many more ways than just its special effects making it a worthwhile read for any student of cinema or enthusiast of Star Wars.

They must have thought Zappa and company were complete nuts. <br /> <br />Although it dates pretty heavily, some songs like, \\"Trouble Every Day\\" still resonate strongly to modern ears. In high school, I wanted a copy of the vinyl but the $100 asking price at the local used record store scared me away. Thank god for the invention of CDs! <br /> <br />Fun to listen to. Obviously, Frank achieved far greater stuff later on. This, however, is where it all began. Suzy Creamcheese, what's got into ya?
B000F3T3CS|5.0|This performance is a gem, fun to watch and beautifully sung. Rolando Villazon is an irresistible puppy, and Anna Netrebko is stunning visually and vocally. I've enjoyed an earlier Met video with Kathleen Battle and Luciano Pavarotti, but it was a \\"performance:\\" big stage, big cast, big stars. This one is intimate, frisky, nimble and light-hearted. Villazon and Netrebko have wonderful chemistry together, and the other principals inhabit their roles with similar gusto and enthusiasm. It's a happy, involving, and touching performance. The camera work is excellent, even showing us the glances between Villazon and the conductor before they repeat \\"una furtiva lagrima.\\" The sound is a little distant and seems to depend on which way the singers are facing, but it's adequate. All in all, the performance is a sparkling gem, guaranteed to generate smiles.
1400063515|4.0|I found The Black Swan very interesting, a bit formidable in parts, but entertaining and a great conversation piece at cocktail parties.

0156027321|4.0|Good novel but after reading the critics the book was a bit diappointing. I would give 3,5 stars if it would be possible but it's more 4 than 3.
0385340559|5.0|I find that sometimes thrillers begin to sound the same after awhile.  You usually have what is the \\"hot topic\\" at the time presented in new and different ways.  Right now, of course, that hot topic is terrorism.  Well, I have come to count on Lee Child giving me a different kind of thriller, since Jack Reacher is such a different type of hero.  In this book he does not disappoint.  I am sure that I have never read a book quite like this one.  Child deals with terrorism, but it's on a more subliminal level.  The books centres around Reacher and his past life as an MP in the Army.  One of his former colleagues reaches out to him in a rather unique way, and Reacher goes down to LA to try to find out who is torturing and killing some of his former Special Team members.  The book moves from LA to Las Vegas and back again, and Reacher and his remaining colleagues uncover a secret plot that puts the security of the US at risk.  I would recommend that you try to start this book early enough in the day that you can finish it in one sitting because you won't want to put it down.  It gives us another insight into Reacher's past life, and it's a page-turning thriller.
075640407X|4.0|I have to admit, up front, that I almost gave up on this book after the first hundred pages or so, but now I am glad that I stuck with it till the end.  The beginning is quite slow, the real story is told in a series of flashbacks by the main character, Kvothe.  It does take awhile for the set up, but you will be richly rewarded if you continue reading.  I espiecally liked his descriptions of the magic system.  So many fantasy stories have these highly implausible systems of magic, but in The Name of the Wind I found myself nodding along to author's explanations, as if, \\"A ha! So that's how magic is supposed to work!\\"
B000O75F7C|5.0|Back in 2001, I wrote a review of the Porcupine Tree album \\"Signify\\" in which I stated boldly that they were \\"The Best Band In The World.\\" In that review I covered the early works of Steve Wilson and his band, from \\"On The Sunday of Life\\" through \\"Lightbulb Sun\\" and I complimented the band on continually innovating and pushing the limits of progressive rock.<br /><br />Since 2001 P-Tree has released three more studio albums. I didn't immediately appreciate the album \\"In Absentia,\\" as the music took a decidedly harder and sharper edge than my older favorites, but with continual listening, the music seeped into my brain and really took hold. \\"Deadwing\\" was released in 2005 and immediately reinvigorated and heightening my enthusiasm for this band that already held an almost god-like status for me.<br /><br />Now with the latest offering, \\"Fear Of A Blank Planet,\\" I am firmly and forever convinced that Steve Wilson can do no wrong. A series of tunes that speak of the growing sense of alienation and isolation we feel in an ever more technological and media driven world. I had the great pleasure of seeing the band play recently (a must see show if you ever have the chance) and the videos that accompanied the music were stunning in their portrayals of youth searching for meaning and direction in an increasingly cold world.<br /><br />I think the older works will always hold a special spot in my heart, and I still list \\"Stupid Dream\\" as my favorite P-Tree album, but \\"Blank Planet\\" is easily the best new album I've heard by any band in many, many years. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Hopefully a DVD of the show will follow later this year, as the videos are equally astounding.<br /><br />So, even though I've said it before, I must continue to preach the word; Porcupine Tree is the best band playing music in the world today!

At age six, Ender is taken to Battle School, a training ground in outer space where he is rigerously prepared to become a formidible commander that will one day be able to finally defeat the dreaded buggers and save the human world. <br /> <br />But amidst the warfare, military strategy, and science fiction, Ender must deal with the everyday realities of being a kid in a world where the adults won't let him just be a kid.  His brilliance and cunning abilities make him the envy and enemy of just about every other student at the Battle School.  Ender must deal with conflicting emotions that come with wanting to belong and have friends versus the pressure to succeed and be the best regardless of how that makes others feel. <br /> <br />This is a brilliant first novel in a series that keeps the pages turning to the very end.  It is a book for everyone - science fiction lovers, students of the military and war, and readers looking for strong human emotion and long lasting relationships.  It is simply amazing to imagine putting a child through the stresses that Ender is put through in this novel.  The addition of a futuristic space setting just adds to the excitment and thrill of the story.  It is a novel that will be difficult to describe to others that have not read it, but describe it one must because it is a novel that anyone can learn from and all can enjoy.
0783114893|5.0|This movie is a tell-tale sign of Rutger Hauer's acting abilities.  At this time he was making a killing in the movie, he was giving us a mysterious character which we know nothing about.  Even so, the viewer is scared of him.  This movie made people quit picking up Hitchhikers, because this could really happen. It even spawned a TV series named after it and a ton of other Hitcher style movies.  If you haven't seen it, watch it before you see the remake, this one blows the new one out of the water.

B000NVIXDW|5.0|Michael Buble brings back the wonderful melodies of yesteryear.  We used to swoon at Frank Sinatra, but how wonderful that Michael is bringing all those songs back, singing them to us.  It's dancing-cheek-to-cheek kind of music!  You will just love this DVD.
1582701709|1.0|One of the contributors to The Secret wrote a book a few years back praising the promotion secrets of P.T. Barnum.  One of the quotations attributed to Barnum is:  \\"There's a sucker born every minute.\\" <br /> <br />As I read The Secret, all I could think about was how the 25 contributors are dividing up the royalty take on this bowser.  Much of this book is so preposterous I can't believe that some of these gurus were able to keep a straight face while doing it.  Is this a giant joke on gullible people?  I honestly can't tell. <br /> <br />As another reviewer said, this is NOT new stuff, and it's NOT a secret.  It doesn't have anything to do with aligning the forces of the Universe.  What it has to do with is self-image.  If you THINK you're a loser, you won't have the self-confidence to be assertive, go after what you want, and live a bold life.  It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, until you change your self-image.  For that, read Maxwell Maltz's Psycho-Cybernetics instead of this.  That book is reality based; The Secret is not. <br /> <br />C'mon folks.  You can visualize and wish and affirm and chant but without some WORK and perseverance and personal effort, it isn't going to happen.  Checks don't appear from nowhere, good health is a matter of right living (unless you're the victim of disease or disability), and right relationships usually happen when you practice the Golden Rule. <br /> <br />The voodoo science in this book won't hold up.  Balls of burning gas (stars), giant hunks of minerals (planets), and the vacuums and other matter that make up the rest of the Universe aren't going to \\"give\\" you anything.  I had an uncle who used to tell his kids, \\"The world doesn't owe you a living,\\" and contrary to what this book preaches, the \\"Universe\\" doesn't owe you anything either, no matter how many good thoughts you think. <br /> <br />If you're sincerely looking for the secret to peace and happiness, I recommend you read They Found the Secret, by V. Raymond Edman.  That's a book that can TRULY change your life. <br />
0393327345|5.0|Tyler Durden, he's in us all, that inner person waiting to come out. I've seen the movie many times before I had read the book, they are very simular. Both the book and the movie are attention grabers, make you think, and keep you guesing. Very intreging novel on finding your inner self, HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. If your to lazy to read the book I recommend you at least see the video, you won't be disappointed.
B000O174CM|1.0|Obviously I did not like this movie.  It has some of my favorite artists and actors in it, but it just never took off.  I was thinking that it would be something like \\"Ray\\", and be based upon the Supreme's motown hits, but the music was not fun and in short this was a boring film.  I gave up on it with 20 minutes to go, something that I rarely do.
B000003S5H|3.0|<br />   Some years ago I saw a hypnotic video on a music show [perhaps Rage, on ABC TV Australia]. The video is hypnotic because it featured a story about two girls, sisters perhaps, who grew up playing various tennis like games. The music and video combined was enchanting so I made a point of one day buying the song or album. Well, I got around to doing so within the last year. <br /> <br />   The music on this album features a mellow female singer in most songs, or, for one song, a heavily accented French man singing English lyrics. The album combines English and French lyrics. The synthesiser is dominant on this album, though you do hear keyboards, pianos, bass, violins, trumpets and tambourines, I think. <br /> <br />   A few of the tracks are instrumentals, but the standout tracks for mine are the poppy songs \\"Sexy boy\\" and \\"Kelly watch the stars\\"...the latter being the hypnotic song I mentioned earlier. In tracks like these you get a heavy bass sound from the keyboard and a groove perhaps like you get in the band Daft Punk [I'm not that familiar with Daft Punk, but to me there seems to be a similarity of sound with Air on occasion].  <br /> <br />   \\"Sexy boy\\" is probably my favourite track on this album. The title is spoken repetitively in this song by a honey voiced French female. Other lyrics are used, but it pretty much has vocal riff of \\"sexy boy\\". <br /> <br />   As for \\"Kelly watch the stars\\" this is a song which reminds me, in a way, of Metallica's \\"One\\". By that I mean the song's strenghts are magnified with the aid of a video, but, by themselves, are weaker without the video. This song does have its strengths though, despite having the title as the only lyrics of the song and repeated frequently. One of those strenghts is, again, the female vocalist's tone of voice. <br /> <br />   The track with the sole male voice appearing is \\"Remember\\" and this song is notable in that it samples the synth beat of my favourite Beach Boys song \\"Do it again\\". Anysong with such a beat/rhythym can't be all that bad...all the heavily accented voice isn't as seductive to this male as the female voices. <br /> <br />   Many tracks have a spacey feeling to them, and a couple, at least, even have sound effects reminescent of the kind of sound effects you hear for UFOs in those science fiction movies of a few decades ago. <br /> <br />   Track #7 on this album features a sythesiser effect which sounds to me like the wind blowing sand in a desert. If you like that part of the track, then check out Jean Michael-Jarre's album \\"Oxygene\\" which has longer passages in this vein. <br /> <br />   Track #1 features some ambient noise or synthesiser effects mimicking a running stream with some forest sounds, like crickets or what have you. <br /> <br />   In closing this album mixes up tracks with a spacey feel, to bass heavy rhythyms which sound cool and are overlayed with keyboard tinkling at the higher end of a keyboard. <br /> <br />   N.B. if you like this kind of music, or instrumentals, or more arty stuff, check out my reviews at this site of: <br /> <br />The Cocteau Twins: Blue belle knoll [not unlike this Air album] <br /> <br />Patti Smith: Horses [a poetic album, lyrically speaking] <br /> <br />Jean Michael Jarre: Oxygene [not reviewed here but highly recommended for instrumental tracks performed on synthesiser] <br /> <br />Midnight Oil: Bird noises [not reviewed here, but a very nice instrumental  features on this EP] <br /> <br />And, lastly, brace yourself: Metallica: Master of Puppets [for the spacey instrumental Orion. The rest of the album is mostly heavy metal. Reviewed here by me]. <br /> <br />
B000093BDX|4.0|Bill, I think you need to go back to school! to say this a better retrospect than Elvis's 30 No. 1 hit's is like saying Cherry Cheesecake is BETTER without the Cherry's. Sheesh.
0385340559|4.0|Ahem. Yes, he does. In this book, for the first time I can recall, we find Reacher comparing himself to others, specifically those men and women with whom he created a superb investigative unit many years before. I rather like this side of Reacher, one that reveals he isn't quite as uncaring about how much money or permanence he  has in his life. But I like him just fine as the wanderer he is. I wonder if that's not a large part of his appeal--the fact that he's so vastly different from most of us, that he exists with total disregard for all the \\"stuff\\" that you and I likely think so important. I suppose it's the contact with his former colleagues, people who matter to him on a much more significant level than any others with whom he comes into contact, that leads him to question his life a bit.<br /><br />In this book, we find Reacher embroiled in a search for some of his friends and colleagues, men who were as well-trained as Reacher, men who seem to be dying (and in pretty hideous ways) right and left. Reacher hooks up with the other members of his old team in order to find out what he can about first one dead friend and then, later, another.<br /><br />We dash about the country with Reacher. LA. Vegas. Parts in between. The whole time, he and his team are trying to piece together what they need in order to both stay alive and perhaps save the missing team members. Oh, did I mention that there's also the threat of some pretty nasty weapons getting into the hands of a nefarious terrorist? No? Well, there you go. So much for Reacher and his team to accomplish!<br /><br />I like the interaction between them; they know each other incredibly well, and it's a joy to see them working together, putting all their formidable skills together. Rarely is Reacher given such an opportunity to work with people who are his equals and whom he respects as much as he does these men and women.<br /><br />As formidable as their skills are, however, this team still makes some mistakes, all of them understandable, all of them due to having only bits and pieces of the whole story before them at any one given time. But they are superb at putting those pieces together, for the most part, and they learn from their mistakes.<br /><br />In the end, of course, Reacher does what he does so well: he saves the people who need saving and doles out payback to those who deserve it. You can count on him for that. What was so good about this book was that we got to see Reacher's self-examination  (as limited as it was) and his great  love for the people he'd worked with and respected.<br /><br />Excellent!istakes, all of them understandable, all of them due to having only bits and pieces of the whole story before them at any one given time.

B000002LVB|5.0|post john cale velvet underground tends to get rated a little lower - which makes sense Cale was one of the great innovators of the time.. but i actually listen to this more than the other albums... It may not explore uncharted territories but it is perfect in its own way.. not a bad track on this album!

B000002UAR|5.0|if there is one valid argument for the legalization of drugs it is the beatles 1966-1968 output and 'revolver' in particular.. The beatles were exploring new territory and making some of the greatest art of the century.. 'revolver' begins where rubber soul left off with a typical rocker 'taxman' and it ends with the groundbreaking 'tommorow never knows' there strangest and most transcendental song to date.. George's contributions are also picking up.. his indian influenced tracks really glue the album together.. paul is responsible for the most classic sounding tracks like elanor rigby, good day sunshine, for no one. and john is at his best the peak of his abilities.. with the aforementioned 'tommorow never knows', doctor robert, and the uncomparable she said she said... this was, perhaps, the bands greatest group effort of their career.. Not as conceptual as sgt pepper - revolver is nevertheless a seemless package that will last as long as rock lasts..

B000E6EJAC|4.0|mott the hoople has a glam sound that truly rocks.. whether covering tunes from lou reed or david bowie or playing originals their sound is original.. While not as innovative as t-rex, bowie, reed - they were able to charm the masses with their sound.. i would highly recommend this for any comprehensive glam collection.. Their version of all the young dudes is monumental..
B00005JPPL|3.0|Only a few comments:<br /><br />The music was quite good. I'd give the movie 3 1/2 stars. I think the scriptwriters struggled a bit. Nice idea... but I think they struggled to make it really interesting. Actors performed reasonably well. I think Nicolas Cage should play more serious roles. I loved him in Face Off, Con Air and The Rock. But one gets the idea he is too serious an actor for these light action movies. Loved to see Jessica Biel and Julianne Moore together on the big screen.

B000EJ9N6Y|4.0|I am familiar with about 95% of the original songs on this album, so I went into listening to this with the usual  scepticism. Turns out though, this album both pays homage to the originals, yet makes them their own. The actual music on this recording is extremely well played/recorded & you can hear all of the little nuances. Sometimes the singing & the music get a little washed out by their use of ambient noises, but all in all, it a well done album.  <br /> <br />I saw one reviewer saying all his female friends like it & I can see why it would be considered more of a \\"chick\\" album, but I think their are enough guys who can relate to the original (mostly from the 80s) songs & appreciate this album. It's not for everyone. I am the first to admit that it can grate on my nerves sometime in the fluffy washy kind of way the voice sings, but that's why I have so much music to choose from. <br /> <br />In general though, I am glad I got a random point in this direction.
B0009X766Y|5.0|THE STING is just a marvelous piece of storytelling.  I don't even know where to begin.  Since I really don't want to give away too many plot details and ruin it, I will say this: con artists provide some of the best plot scenarios in celluloid storytelling!  That is, if the story is as well-orchestrated and seamless as George Ray Hill's take on an unbelievable storyline, centered on two con men (Paul Newman and Robert Redford) seeking vengeance on the head of a mobster (Robert Shaw) who knocked off their colleague.  And, that's the only plot element I'm going to reveal.  If anything, you should see it for the marvelous Scott Joplin score.  You can't replicate this kind of brilliant filmmaking.  If you haven't fallen in love with Paul Newman already, you will after you see this!
0385336691|5.0|My sister left this for me to read at a time when I was really ready for another good reading marathon.  I'd never read any of Lee Child's work before, but dove in, went under and didn't want to come back up until I finished.  It was so good I went and bought 5 more of his Jack Reacher novels to gorge on, and am halfway through the first of the five. It looks like this one, \\"The Killing Floor\\", is at least as good as \\"The Hard Way\\". Guess I'll have a new collection of all of them before long.<br /><br />If you enjoy mystery thrillers, don't miss these!
0446310786|5.0|TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD was one of the most memorable I books I read as a young pre-teen.  For starters, Harper Lee wrote a wonderful account of very adult circumstances in the voice (and through the eyes) of a very astute young girl, Scout Finch.  How is that a young girl who has barely lived life seen so much?  Her father, Atticus Finch, is a very dedicated lawyer facing a very hard case ahead of him--a rape case that takes their town of Maycomb by storm.  This book takes a keen look at racism and integrity in a small town.<br /><br />This book is so wonderful and I am so glad that it still lives on as a great novel, in the hearts and eyes of a whole new generation of readers.

B000KQGP2G|5.0|In Pain Of Salvation, I have always found the antidote to popular music- a band which is intelligent, musically and lyrically adventurous, and always seems to push their own boundaries as well as those of their audience and fans with each new release. A rarity, indeed, in today's popular culture, and with this album Daniel Gildenlow and co. may have created more controversy than usual.<br /><br />In \\"Scarsick\\", POS continues the examination of an individual's role in society, and the responsibility of society for the shaping and influence of each citizen's life within it. Continuing or completing a sort of story arc arguably begun in \\"Remedy Lane\\" (or \\"The Perfect Element, Pt 1\\" if you prefer), this disc is an interesting, politically-and ethically-charged epic examination of life in modern society, and is quite vitriolic and accusatory at times, particularly condemning America's narcissistic and shallow capitalist culture and unwelcome influence in the world. Like it or not, I found Gildenlow's lengthy (and at times quite witty, sardonic and articulate) rantings thought-provoking and compelling. The music is equally diverse and experimental, and although POS are usually located in the \\"progressive metal\\" section (if you should be so lucky to have one in your local music store- *grin*), this band is becoming more and more experimental, diverse, and unpredictable....without ruining any of it (and quite frankly, most POS albums take a few spins to even begin to \\"understand\\"), this disc is an amalgamation of not only diverse musical styles, but also disparate genres used in clever and unusual ways to illustrate a point in the overall story arc of the album. Avant-garde, fascinating, stimulating, and truly creative. Thinking man's modern rock album, and a future classic. Thank you Daniel Gildenlow......
B000QYM6MU|5.0|I absolutely love this show. It has the best acting, writing and directing on TV today. Not to mention the coolest car ('67 Impala) and the greatest music (classic rock). And if you're worried about the \\"supernatural\\" theme, don't be. The show is more about family relationships than scary monsters. Buy [[ASIN:B000FP2OPY Supernatural - The Complete First Season]] or rent Season 1 and see if you don't get hooked.

1400049628|1.0|This book is a stiff, shambling, lifeless horror not unlike the zombies it portrays. <br /> <br />I don't know what gigantic practical joke over at Three Rivers Press convinced Mr Brooks that a book about fighting zombies should be serious, but the result is a section on \\"Setting a zombie on fire\\" so boring it makes me want to cry.  If you'd told me that was possible last week I would have laughed at you.  Now, I can only weep. <br /> <br />Understanding how this could have happened becomes a lot easier when you realise that fully 5% of the book is given over to advertising his 'serious novel', World War Z.  Which I won't be reading.  Painfully hilarious is the introductory section which spends a full page explaining that this book won't deal with silly \\"movie zombies\\" - you know, the ENTIRE REASON this book has a market.  Nope, Mr Brooks thinks its far better to stick with his own overspecific and very restrictive zombie description for the entire work. <br /> <br />I'm donating my copy of this tragedy to the local library, so that anyone else who wants to check it out doesn't have to buy it.  Because purchasing this from the 'humour' section of a bookstore would be funding the biggest categorisation error since the Titanic was labelled \\"unsinkable\\".  A zombie book stating that both shotguns and chainsaws are bad weapons simply doesn't understand it's own source material.

B00005JPLU|3.0|As a film in the purely entertaining role I think it deserves a 5 star rating, it is riveting, very well crafted and a very good adaptation of Miller's graphic novel.  But then and not trying to be pedantic I will say some details ruin the whole effect of the movie.  First the phalanx did not open to allow warriors to fight alone, the strength of this battle formation relies in its unity and they always fought in close formation, if the spartans fought as depicted in the movie they would have gotten killed in the first encounter.  I know it is an allegory but details go over the top, why depict monsters such as Ephialtes, the persian king executioners and even the inmortals when it is not needed, the sheer number of persians was enough to overwhelm any enemy why put some silly characters as it does not detract or add from the action but anyway it makes the movie silly.  The inmortals were bodyguards of the Persian King recruited from the best persian nobility and trained to fight as a greek phalanx, they were called as such because they were always 5000 men and when some of them died they were inmediately replaced and of course their numbers never shrunk thus were inmortals, but otherwise they were no monsters and did not fight in Ninja garb and with japanese swords as depicted in the movie.  Even though no live historian was actually there at the battle and can attest it I believe that is very unlikely that the Persians used elephants or rhinos in fighting the Thermopylae battle, why put these scenes there at all?.  About the spartans, they were never a democracy and did not defend any democratic ideals, the Athenians had a democracy in place but the Spartans were ruled by kings, a very selective aristocracy of warriors who practiced eugenics thus getting rid of lame or weak infants, and also held in slavery millions of helots which were not depicted in the movie.  The Spartan society was a military camp that produced very fine warriors and in some aspects was used as a model for youth training by some very totalitarian societies such as Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.  The first 10 minutes of the movie were the best as the Agoge or process of training of young spartan warriors was very well explained although with its cinematic exaggerations.  Then the weapons used by the spartans were all wrong, first  the spartans at that time used full panoply which means they wore cuirass, helmet, graeves and hoplite shield which was made of wood covered with bronze not as a full metal shield depicted in the movie which would be heavy and un-wieldly, then spartans relied in a heavier spear as the one shown in the movie as a main weapon usually killing the enemy with a the spear [...] as they passed over them in formation than stabbing the enemy, the battle was more a pushing and shoving contest and when you fell you were either trampled to death or dispatched by a noncombatant with a knife as you lay helpless on the ground, not as depicted in the movie as a swordplay. Anyway the spartans use scimitars in this movie which is all wrong, as spartans usually had a stabbing short sword called a xyphos that was needed to  fight at very closed quarters when you don't have room to maneuver a sable or longer sword, so the head chopping and arm cutting scenes were probably wrong.  The Persians were an aryan people whose resemblance would be more near to present day armenians, circasians than dark arabic or african types as depicted in the movie, I believe also King Xerxes was badly represented specially in the robes in which he is shown that resemble more an African warlord look than a Sixth century BC Persian noble.  So because of all the annoying details that were so unnecesary and because a superproduction with so much care in the technical aspects could take a little better care of the historic details without making it aboring movie I will have to substract 2 stars and give it a 3 -star rating.d as a model for youth training by some very totalitarian societies such as Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.

B00005JPAO|5.0|This movie portrays the time from the beginning of Tony Blair's era as Prime Minister through the difficult days of Princess Diana's death.  It shows the tenuous relationship between Queen Elizabeth II and the Prime Minister and traces the seeming indifference of the monarchy to the tragedy in Paris.  The Queen, Prince Philip, Charles, William, and Harry are at Balmoral Castle in Scotland when Diana is killed, and at first they do not respond to her death, calling it a \\"private, family matter\\" and assuming that the public would want them to handle it in a dignified and quiet manner.  Tony Blair (played brilliantly by Michael Sheen) has his hand on the pulse of the nation and he tries to warn the Queen that she is going against public opinion by staying silent.  Helen Mirren plays the queen with wonderful dignity and restraint and shows her to be the dutiful monarch that she is, but she also shows us flashes of the human side of her, such as when she admits to the Prime Minister that she has \\"never been so hated before\\".  It is very difficult to portray a contemporary occurrence in a movie, but the script-writer and actors get this one just right.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|I never write amazon reviews...but west wing is such a special show that I encourage absolutely everyone to check it out.  What a wild 7 years.  Even after Sorkin left, it was still one of the best shows on the air.  My only complaint was how little we get to see of the last 12 months of the Barlett administration in the final season, giving way instead to the Santos campaign.  Martin Sheen should have been given more time to contemplate the end of Bartlet's term.  Fantastic finish nonetheless.
B000H305U0|3.0|Justin Timberlake's second solo album \\"FutureSex/LoveSounds\\" again teamed him with the most sought-after producer of the day Timbaland (who just about at the same time joined forces with Nelly Furtado on her \\"Loose\\" album). Anyway, the by-the-number sex allusions on this record wear tiring and (pardon me - despite Timberlake's recent crown as the sexiest male celebrity) unrealistic. <br /> <br />The disc works as a whole, yet it lacks more good songs -- something you could rely on at \\"Justified\\". The Timbaland stamp on the \\"Sexy Back\\" first single and other two of the first three album tracks is solid. The power does not last long, though. The slower songs \\"My Love\\" and \\"What Goes Around\\" are very probably the best that this disc has to offer; however, even these never equal the first Timberlake/Timbaland hit, the stunner of \\"Cry Me a River\\" from \\"Justified\\". (When you listen closely, they sound rather alike). <br /> <br />I don't have any problem with crediting artists with praise when they deserve it (no problems for me with JT's boy-band past), but after the promising \\"Justified\\" full of classic-leaning grooves, this modern-sounding but ultimately unsexy album is a bit of a letdown. Justin is a great singer in his type of songs. But the time has come for him to spread the horizon. <br /> <br />The final word: although a big commercial hit (sometimes \\"sex\\" is enough for that), for me \\"FS/LS\\" came dangerously close to sophomore slump. If Justin wants to continue a big star and gain reputation as a lasting artist, next time he'll have to offer something big.
B000MNP2K8|1.0|The WORST ever of the series. <br />Everything is not Bond as Ian wished him to be, as well as the screenplay.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|But I'll add my 5 stars anyway. This album deserves them all. My wife kept telling me she wanted to get this new CD from an English lady she'd heard. She finally got it and the next time we got in the car she said \\"You've got to hear this.\\" I just rolled my eyes. I'm a grey beard, and although I like lots of different music, there's precious little mainstream new music that interests me. But I instantly fell in love with Rae's. Track after track, just plain great music. There's no filler on this CD. Every song makes you glad you have her CD.  Note: If you order this CD, make sure you buy the full album with all the songs, and not the CD that has just one or two songs.  Favorite tracks:  1. Enchantment  2. Put Your Records On  3. Breathless  4. Trouble Sleeping
B000N3ST7K|5.0|The movies were great - I went to see it 4 times and I am digging in my house to go see it again! <br /> <br />The sounds tracks are just as good - check out the book - it's has the dialogs in it..............Useless talent# 10!
B00000K3D4|5.0|I'm always surprised to hear that this movie did poorly in the box office when first released. It's an imaginative and entertaining fantasy movie that doesn't need CGI dragons or epic battles to pull it off. Instead it has the kind of goofy creatures and battles that thrill and make one smile. David Bowie influenced a generation of young girls with his various pants in this film.
0066620996|5.0|\\"Good to Great\\" by Jim Collins, is a very entertaining explanation of how to take a company from a profitable business to an icon.  Collins lays out a step-by-step process with great comparisons and clear examples.  His amazing ability to take unorganized data and form knowledgeable connections helps prove his ideas without doubt.  This book was a combined five year effort of Jim Collins and twenty team members to collect unarguable facts.  Their research is recorded, without bias, in this concise and easy to read book.  A must read for CEO's, managers or readers even loosely connected to an organization of any kind.
B00005MP58|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this mini series, despite having never read the books. I'm not sure how faithful it was to the author's intent. The story has a good pace and the cast does a fine job. I watched this after seeing the newer movie version and the only real difference seems to be budget. The scenes are the same (basically) and Knightly copies the actress in this version as much as possible. This is a better version for people who want a bit more length and plot.<br /><br />The tension between the two leads is drawn out so much more in this version. If you're looking for chemistry moments, this is the one.
B00005R62K|5.0|Stained Class is in many ways a groundbreaking album.It introduced in my opinion the beginning of speed/thrash(Exciter).Rob Halford's vocals are almost unbelievable,I've yet to hear anything that compares.The guitar soloing is 3 levels above anything else at that time.Thirty years later it still stands out as a phenomenal metal showcase of vocals and guitar .This might be the most influential metal album of all time!!P.S.The guitar solo on \\"Beyond the Realms of Death\\" is considered by many the best metal solo of all time.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|Stargate: Atlantis is an excellent and entertaining show that really stands above its parent show (Stargate: SG-1). This spin off not only has beautiful locations and solid writing, but a solid cast of characters. You really come to love each of them and episodes are dedicated into exploring their real issues and trials. This first season is my favorite (barely beating out the 3rd) because of some of the Rodney McKay centered episodes. All of the interactions between McKay and Sheppard are immensely entertaining. Nerd references and fun abound in this kick-off season.
B000M341QO|5.0|I'm not a words person so I'll give a rating of all the qualities of the movie. <br />Acting: 9/10 <br />Leonardo DiCaprio - 9/10, almost perfect performance <br />Matt Damon - 8/10, good but does not come off naturally <br />Mark Walberg - 9/10, very intense <br />Jack Nicholson - 6/10, pretentious, overacts many scenes <br />Baldwin - 8/10, very funny <br />Leading Lady - 7/10, very sexy  <br /> <br />Directing: 9/10 <br />Story - 9/10, great story, some parts might be hard to follow on first viewing <br />Setting - 9/10, captures Boston beautifully <br />Music - 9/10, awesome music, especially Shipping up to Boston <br /> <br />Overall - 9/10, incredible movie, only a handful of movies ever are better than this. Godfather, Good Will Hunting and only a few others are better than this. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00008RWRH|5.0|WOW! Could anyone ever think of Haydn as thrilling? If not, listen to this set! Jochum, who has now joined Furtwangler in my pantheon of godlike conductors, brings a fire and exhilaration that sweeps over every note. I am especially impressed and moved by his performance of no. 98, written in memory of the recently deceased Mozart (the slow movement really echos that of the \\"Jupiter\\", something I never noticed before hearing Jochum). The recorded sound is superb in its naturalness, and the LPO follows Jochum perfectly. As a bonus, the last CD contains earlier Jochum Haydn recordings, including his no. 98 with the Berlin Philharmonic. Although the BPO is my favorite orchestra of all, I find myself prefering the later LPO version for its even greater forcefulness. It seems that while other conductors mellowed with time, Jochum seemed to gain in fire and flame as he aged.
B000LC4ZF8|4.0|One of the most enjoyable films of the 80s is Big, in which Tom Hanks... well, you already know by now. <br /> <br />I liked almost everything about this 2-disc set. <br /> <br />One MAJOR gotcha, however.  Or maybe two, depending on how you look at it. <br /> <br />If you play the Extended Cut (Disc 1) with the Commentary set to On, you get a) no commentary, and b) a Spanish soundtrack. <br /> <br />If you play the Theatrical version with Commentary set to On, you get essentially nothing BUT commentary.  No dialog from the film can be heard, as far as I could tell. <br /> <br />Playing Theatrical or Extended versions with Commentary set to Off is just fine. <br /> <br />The Extras disc is nice, but the aforementioned flaws should truly be addressed.
B00005JPAO|3.0|i'm half afraid to give my opinion after reading many of the 5 star reivews ...lol..but, give me a chance here .    firstly i think ms. mirren is one of britains top actresses and i never missed any of her \\" prime suspect \\" series .  now having given her kudos ,  i must say ..i loved how ms. mirren looked so much like the real deal .  also the direction was good and scenery .  now here's where i make enemies ..lol    most of us were among the living when Diana died so, the only real truth were the edited, melded  in news  films of that shocking time .    what bothers me is ..how the heck does anyone know what the queen said in the privacy of her quarters with hubby and the queen mum ?  so, everyone who takes that as hard truth must believe in the easter bunny as well .   no way anyone could know ..if someone overheard ...she'd know and ...goodbye to them at the ole palace .off with their head .    well, i almost bought the dvd on the strength of ms. mirren being in title role BUT, was spared the money when it was first loaned to me .    yes, i guess it's worth watching once if you are among the curious or weren't near any t.v.'s when diana died or maybe believe in those  reality shows where cameras ( viewers can't see )  are all over the stars  house and some people actually  believe we are true voyeurs getting our very own private lookyloo  ...lol.    hellen mirren deserved the academy award ....acting good ...likeness near perfect . but, again , where did the private dialogue come from ?  not from the real queen , you bettcha.    anyone believe the prime minister  gave out secret conversations ?  I mean really ? and as for bonny prince charles , i'm guessing that after the initial shock of  hearing of Diana's death he and his then mistress were privately singing a couple choruses of \\" OH HAPPY DAY \\" !!!  rent the dvd ..once is plenty .
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Looking back on this album, this was how The Beatles really were. When these sessions were recorded around January 1969, they were a most fractuous \\"group\\". Nobody other than Paul, really wanted the The Beatles to continue on. John Lennon himself, at the time was so whacked out, that he could care less. Originally, they were going to release Let It Be/Get Back, in horribly recorded form. Along came Phil Spector-----who, without Paul's knowledge, added over produced nonsense, to their sound. Listen to \\" The Long and Winding Road\\"---before, and after. The reason why we have Abbey Road, is the group wanted to go out, on a better note, than the musical slop that was the fun and head games, played at Twickenham Studios/Apple.
B000002UAU|5.0|It is always interesting and amusing to read all of reviews written by mainly Kids that were never even around, when this recording was made. Lennon himself made no bones about this, at the time. He scoffed at the notion that this was a \\" Concept Album\\". He always said that it was a collection of Songs, and that it \\" didn't go anywhere, other than the Opening, and the Reprise, at the end\\". While I have always enjoyed it, It was Paul's concept, they got to play dress-up, and to do something that was at the time, different, from all of the other Pop songs out.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|So happy this arrived just before having to drive from the East Coast to Fla;)  It must have been 4 or 5 hours before I realized I had just listened to this album several times through.  Instant classic as it seems anything they release is.  Not as experimental or introverted as other releases, but timeless, and flows like a cool ocean breeze.
B000002UB3|5.0|Speaking with the authority of an old guy who was back then able to discover the wonder of each new Beatle release while the vinyl was still warm . . . this is their best album.  It's also one of the best albums ever made by ANY artist in the category of \\"There's Something On Here For Everybody\\".<br /><br />I'm of course fond of the old vinyl, but the CD sound stays sharp and the disc brushes off easier when you drop ashes on it.  Unfortunately, a typical drawback with the CD version of any of the Beatles work . . . I have not yet been able to successfully play the CD backwards (as part of my ongoing \\"Is Paul Dead?\\" project).  And the darn cover art is so small I had to use a magnifying glass to tell who all was wearing shoes.<br /><br /> *** Recommended ***
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|Frank Miller adaptations are on a roll. First we got \\"Sin City,\\" and now we have the story of three hundred Spartans who repelled a massive invasion.<br /><br />And the adaptation of \\"300\\" is a stunning one -- literally stunning, since it bombards the viewer with larger-than-life characters, smashing visuals and tight direction. It goes a bit too fast for its own good, but it's a truly epic film that takes the historical war movie to another level -- all the more so because it actually happened.<br /><br />As the introduction tells us, the Spartans were the ultimate warrior people. Babies were inspected for weakness or faults, and killed if they had any; as they were growing up, they were taught and toughened by a savage regimen. Their only true hope was to \\"die beautifully\\" for their land.<br /><br />A Persian messenger arrives, telling King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) that the god-king Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) wants the Spartans to bow to him. Leonidas' response: shove the Persians into a pit. But before he can go to war, he must consult the corrupt priesthood of Ephors and their beautiful Oracle. She predicts that Sparta will fall and the gods forbid war at the approach of the Carneaian festival -- courtesy of a hefty bribe from a Spartan traitor.<br /><br />So Leonidas takes out three hundred of his best men, along with their nervy Arcadian allies, and begin trouncing the Persians. But they are being sabotaged, both by a hunchbacked outcast and by a treacherous councilor, whom Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) is battling. And so at Thermopylae, Leonidas prepares for a final battle against the monstrous Persian Army -- knowing that their story of freedom will live on.<br /><br />This is not a \\"sensitive\\" movie where you have any appreciation for the bad guys -- it's a glorification of three hundred soldiers who died for their land and freedom. It just wouldn't work otherwise. It doesn't blindly adore the Spartans -- we see their darker side in their \\"weed out the weak\\" policy -- but it does appreciate them. They respect and care about each other, and Leonidas is as kind as he can be even to Ephialtes, the traitor.<br /><br />And it's done in a manner appropriate to its comic book origins -- grimy, bloody and epic, but with a stylized look that is almost like CGI. The battles are shockingly good, and full of fantasy-ish creations like the monstrous creatures or the silver-masked Immortals. Even a wall of corpses. But we also get some beautiful visuals as well -- roiling seas, sunlit battlefields, Spartan cities, and the drugged Oracle in her white veil.<br /><br />While the script gets a bit over-the-top at times, it's hard not to be moved by dialogue that can be darkly funny (\\"It's just an eye. The gods saw fit to grace me with a spare\\") or stirring (\\"He did not wish tribute, nor song, or monuments or poems of war and valor. His wish was simple: \\"Remember us.\\" That was his hope, should any free soul come across that place, in all the countless centuries yet to be\\").<br /><br />Butler and Headey are simply great as Leonidas and Gorgo -- they're both strong, passionate and fearless, and they both do a great job in their separate storylines. But the movie is filled with good performances -- David Wenham as the narrator, Dominic West as a disgusting traitor, Santoro as the decadent, arrogant god-king, and many others.<br /><br />This version contains both the regular and high-def versions, and apparently contains a small wealth of extras -- featurettes about the history of Thermopylae and the 300 Spartans, photo galleries, info on the Spartan culture, commentary, deleted scenes, and info on Frank Miller (who, of course, wrote the original graphic novel). It's sort of the decorative icing on a cake -- not necessary to enjoy the film, but it makes it just a bit better.<br /><br />\\"300\\" is a unique, stirring, stunning movie that pushes the action-movie envelope, and gives a thrilling edge to a real-life story of overwhelming power. A brilliant movie.
B00003A9QI|5.0|I'm not a music critic, but I love this album, perhaps even more than the movie! I have probably read (and written more!) academic papers while listening to it than anything else.  <br /> <br />Not sure why, but unlike many other recordings, I find that I'm able to still perform cognitively intense work while listening to it -- and it beautifully complements the view of the green hills and river from our engineering library!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I admit it.  I am absolutely hooked on this show.  It isn't simply because the main characters are fairly easy on the eyes.  There is some great storytelling in this series.  It's also the detail that goes into the stories, especially the little ones: Dean's goofy grin at the waitress in the episode \\"Dead in the Water\\" and Sam's obvious delight when Missouri berates his brother before he even opens his mouth in \\"Home\\" are only two such examples.<br /><br />My only gripe with this DVD set is about some of those little details.  A few of them have been trimmed.  Granted, you wouldn't miss them at all if you have never seen the stories and they didn't add anything to the storyline.  One was in the episode \\"Skin.\\"  There is a scene where Dean walks up to Sam in an alley after talking to the police and tells him that it is definitely their kind of job.  When the episode was broadcast, Dean did a goofy \\"Am I good or what?\\" thing reminiscent of the move Fonzie used to do on Happy Days (\\"Aaayyyyyyyy...\\")  On the DVD version, it is gone.  It's weird but I found myself missing that little thing.  It was one of the many little imperfections that humanizes these characters.<br /><br />Okay, maybe hooked isn't the right word.  Maybe borderline obsessive would be better.  In any case, this is great TV and well worth the purchase.
0143038419|3.0|After a devastating divorce and personal breakdown, the author received a nice advance from her publisher to travel for a year and write this book. Where do I sign up??? But seriously, Ms. Gilbert writes beautifully, and her book has a nice balance of entertainment and depth. I especially admire the way she tackled writing about the non-dual, transcendant, samadhi experience universally described as indescribable. <br /> <br />I have one big beef with the author however. She fails to mention that the Swamiji she speaks of in such glowing terms, Swami Muktananda, developed some quirky habits late in life, such as molesting young girls and women on a gynecological exam table he had built for that purpose. I can't accept that an intelligent and well-read journalist like Ms. Gilbert could be unaware of these abuses, which are well documented (check any of the numerous websites for Siddha Yoga ex-members). I feel she has made a deliberate omission of her beloved guru's checkered past, and not given her readers the full picture. Maybe she thinks it is no longer relevant, now that he is deceased. But trust me, while Ms. Gilbert was having all those beautiful experiences, there are victims out there who will spend the rest of their lives trying to understand what they went through. Has the Siddha Yoga organization ever apologized to them, or even acknowledged that abuses happened? What about the victims' spiritual growth? They deserve better.

B000OCXMAE|5.0|People, I know my english is terrible. but i think you need to read this review. <br /> <br />1. they climbing right path to being a successful band. <br />To people who loves Hybrid Theory or Meteora, this album has another vision of their musics. They wanted to produce new musics certainly, and they did it successfuly. Don't give a damn to their ballads, a good music could be valuable as an album, and this ablum has 12 of them. <br /> <br />2. My advice to you is, before rating this album, listen to it carefully. This album is the type that grows each time you play it. and each time it deserve more stars. <br /> <br />3. As a life time rock music fan, I have to say, The album is great. music technics in this ablum is 180 degree different from two last albums. <br /> <br />4.

1401302378|5.0|Note: I recently re-read this book, deleted my earlier review, and how share what follows.<br /><br />In the October 2004 issue of Wired magazine, Chris Anderson published an article in which he shared these observations: \\"(1) the tail of available variety is far longer than we realize; (2) it's now within reach economically; (3) all those niches, when aggregated, can make up a significant market - seemed indisputable, especially backed up with heretofore unseen data.\\" That is even truer today than it was three years ago. The era that Anderson characterizes as \\"a market of multitudes\\" continues to grow in terms of both its nature and extent. In this book, Anderson takes his reader on a guided tour of this market as he explains what the probable impact the new market will have and what will be required to prosper in it.<br /><br />According to Anderson, those who read the article saw the Long Tail everywhere, from politics to public relations, and from sheet music to college sports. \\"What people intuitively grasped was that new efficiencies in distribution, manufacturing, and marketing were changing the definition of what was commercially viable across the board. The best way to describe these forces is that they are turning unprofitable customers, products, and markets into profitable ones.\\" Therefore, the story of the Long Tail is really about the economics of abundance: \\"what happens when the bottlenecks that stand between supply and demand in our culture start to disappear and everything becomes available to everyone.\\"<br /><br />If I understand Anderson's most important points (and I may not), they include these:<br /><br />1. Make as much as possible available to as many people as possible.<br />2. Help them to locate what they need, quickly and easily.<br />3. Offer maximum inventory only online.<br />4. Customize supply chain in terms of niche markets<br />5. Maximize its efficiencies and economies (especially inventory control, order processing, and distribution,)<br />5. Be customer-driven in terms of \\"crowdsourcing\\"<br />6. Have strategy that separates content into its component parts (i.e. \\"microchunking\\")<br />7. Have a pricing strategy that is \\"elastic\\" (i.e. based on the ROI of fulfillment per product per niche).<br />8. Have an open source business model for information sharing.<br />9. In markets where scarcity exists, \\"guesstimate\\" costs, margins, sales, profits, etc.<br />10.Where there is abundant competition, let those markets \\"sort it all out.\\"<br /><br />These and other points can guide and inform decision makers as they struggle to compete profitably during the era of \\"long-tailed distributions,\\" when culture is unfiltered by economic scarcity and high technology is turning mass markets into millions of niches. Anderson provides invaluable advice with regard to how minimize the cost of reaching, penetrating, and then developing a multiple of niche markets. The paradigm has shifted from selling more in fewer markets to selling less in more markets but also, key point, selling as much as possible within as many segments as possible -- and prudent -- within those markets.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this volume are urged to check out two books by Henry Chesbrough, Open Innovation: The New Imperative for Creating and Profiting from Technology and Open Business Models: How to Thrive in the New Innovation Landscape. Also Geoffrey Moore's Dealing with Darwin: How Great Companies Innovate at Every Phase of Their Evolution, Howard Gardner's Five Minds for the Future, Richard Ogle's Smart World: Breakthrough Creativity and the New Science of Ideas, Gary Hamel's The Future of Management, Noel Tichy and Warren Bennis' Judgment: How Winning Managers Make Smart Calls, Steven Feinberg's The Advantage-Makers: How Exceptional Leaders Win by Creating Opportunities Others Don't, and Seeing What's Next: Using Theories of Innovation to Predict Industry Change co-authored by Clayton M.

0061150142|4.0|After reading Nick Hornby's \\"A Long Way Down\\", reading \\"The Pact: A Love Story\\" by Jodi Picoult put me on a suicide roll of sorts. A brilliant, beautiful and talented teenage girl dies violently in an apparent botched double suicide with the steady boyfriend she's know since almost birth. Ms. Picoult has a good ear for the voices and issues of young people. Her female adults (the mothers) are more sharply drawn than the males (maybe from personal experience), though she handles the crater that such an event would leave in the relationship between two close-knit families very well.  She'll keep you guessing most of the way about what really happened that night, though I more or less figured it out before the big revelation. I liked the other book I read by her (she's written many) \\"The Tenth Circle\\", probably because of the literary angle (the title refers to Dante's circles of hell). Picoult fans, based on Amazon ratings, seem to like \\"The Pact\\" better. Still I'd recommend this book to those who enjoy stories about contemporary American families with children (Joyce Carol Oates' [[ASIN:0452282829 We Were the Mulvaneys (Oprah's Book Club)]] being my favorite of this genre).
B000002I53|5.0|It's John Coltrane - what more do I have to say?  Five stars!
1594481938|4.0|\\"A Long Way Down\\" by Nick Hornby is a modern-day story of the \\"fun\\" side of suicide. Got your attention? The core event takes place in the very first chapter as four widely varied people (a scandalized TV host, a lonely single mother of an brain-damaged adult \\"child\\", a spoiled teenage daughter of a British government official, and a guitar player whose band and life have just broken up) find themselves on the roof of a London apartment building (a \\"tower block\\" in Brit-speak) on New Year's Eve all planning to do the same thing--throw themselves off. Could you commit suicide with other potential victims watching? I didn't think so, and neither could these folks. The rest of the book chronicles their mostly humorous efforts to keep living from day-to-day and month-to-month. Hornby has a way with character that he displays by having the four protagonists alternate as narrator. An enjoyable read recommended for adults--though who knows, it might help convince some suicidal teenager to give life another chance.
B0002V7OI8|5.0|Tea Leoni played a convincing character in this movie.  Morgan Freeman was nothing short of outstanding as President in this film.  Great story that makes you think!  Five stars!
B000EHRVP6|1.0|The thing that ruins this movie the most is how conveniently everything falls into place at the end.  All the loose ends are tied up nicely and all previous characters are revisited.  Lame.  Some of the worst writing ever.  Skip this.

0316018953|1.0|I'm a long time Connelly fan, but I think he's run out ideas.   <br /> <br />First, this is a very short book (note to publishers...using large print face and lots of space between the lines does not a book make).  Even given the brevity of the book, there are sections which do nothing to advance the plot but seem to have been included simply to add pages.  For example, the meeting with the police chief adds nothing to the plot, but does fill up a few pages. <br /> <br />Next, Connelly has managed to turn Bosch into a cardboard character...something that I would not have thought possible.  And the rest of the characters don't even have that much dimension. <br /> <br />And finally, the plot starts well but takes a ridiculous turn at the end starting with highly improbable events, and ending with a \\"solution\\" that has nothing to do with the rest of the story.  My feeling was that this was written with no real plan, that it had to be finished to meet a deadline, and that a \\"glued on\\" ending was contrived to finish the project. <br /> <br />Read the early Connelly books...but skip this one.

0767802470|4.0|The 3.5 hours watching it did not feel long to me, and it was a generally enjoyable production.  There was apparently considerable effort at accuracy and realism in portraying the way things were on a U-boot.  But, there were some things that distracted me from the realism. <br /> <br />The English subtitles are often not a translation of the German but a representation of what the translator assumed a typical, modern day American would say.  It wasn't a big distraction for me, but I think I would have preferred a more literal translation. <br /> <br />A bigger distraction for me was seeing all attempts at realism abandoned to show the U-boat magically surviving depth charges.  I kept wondering if this U-boat was made of Star Trek tritanium material. <br /> <br />The biggest disappointment was the ending.  I can understand wanting to end with something dramatic, but this was such an obvious gratuitous cheap shot out of left field trying to evoke an emotional response that it impressed me as an insult to reasonable intelligence rather than a dramatic twist.  One can look up the history of the U-96. <br />

B000002GQJ|5.0|To start off, what a topnotch remastering job on this splendid release! :)<br /><br />Here is where my favorite mix of \\"Question\\" can be found (I prefer this mix over the mixes featured on the \\"This Is The Moody Blues\\" and \\"Voices In The Sky\\" collections, because I was first introduced to the album mix). The loud and energetic introduction, with the crashing drums, mellotrons, and chanting vocal, really gets me psyched, whenever I hear it! Good for the 1996 compilation, \\"The Best Of The Moody Blues\\" (And 1998's \\"Moody Blues Anthology\\") featuring the album mix of this Justin Hayward hit, I might add. :)<br /><br />\\"How Is It (We Are Here)\\" features outstanding mellotrons, making me think back to the mellotron-driven sound of \\"To Our Children's Children's Children\\" ... This Mike Pinder track sounds more like a track from \\"Children's,\\" more than any other on \\"A Question Of Balance.\\" The instrumental break is out of this world, featuring the electric guitar (sounding like a prelude to the \\"bee buzz\\" electric guitar heard on \\"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\\" and onward) blending in with the mellotrons, as well as the super-cool high \\"squeaking\\" synthesizer effects, giving the song an otherworldly sound.<br /><br />\\"And The Tide Rushes In\\" makes for a calm and beautiful tune, and the instrumentation creates the setting of a tranquil seashore with waves \\"rushing in,\\" in the distance. :)<br /><br />\\"Don't You Feel Small\\" sounds a bit on the eerie side, with the whispered voice accompanying the singing (You can hear the same style of vocal overdubbing on The Doors' hit, \\"Riders On The Storm\\"). Ray Thomas plays the flute in a similar fashion to the solo heard in the middle of \\"Legend of A Mind,\\" from \\"In Search Of The Lost Chord,\\" and it sounds superb! You can also hear some deep haunting sounds from the mellotrons, near the end of the song, reminiscent of the mellotrons heard on the \\"Children's\\" track, \\"Eternity Road.\\" This is an unusual but cool sounding Moody Blues' track. :)<br /><br />The percussion sounds excellent on John Lodge's \\"Tortoise and the Hare,\\" and so do the rockin' double-tracked lead guitars, during the instrumental break ... Also, notice that John Lodge's voice is double-tracked (And also separated, slightly, from one another, in the stereo field, as heard through headphones), as he sings in two octaves during the \\"While you were sleeping\\" parts of the song.<br /><br />\\"It's Up To You\\" reminds me of \\"Lovely To See You,\\" from \\"On The Threshold Of A Dream,\\" only slightly more mellow. The double-tracked electric guitars sound wonderful, once again, and I like the \\"wave-like\\" effects from the drums during the \\"If they knew that we have got nothing to lose\\" parts of the song. :)<br /><br />\\"Minstrel's Song,\\" much like \\"Every Good Boy's\\" track \\"Nice To Be Here,\\" is an upbeat, cheerful tune, and the flutes and percussion really stand out, on this track. Justin Hayward's brief solo, \\"Listen to the One ... Who sings of love,\\" near the end of the song, is sung with perfection, and right on the beat!<br /><br />\\"Dawning Is The Day\\" reminds me of \\"Tuesday Afternoon,\\" from \\"Days Of Future Passed,\\" when listening to the combination of the flute, mellotron, and piano. Notice how, near the end of the song, the Moodies chant, \\"Listen, we think we have found you,\\" repeatedly, but right before the song fades into \\"Melancholy Man,\\" the lyrics switch over to \\"Listen, we think we can see you\\" ... How sneaky! :)<br /><br />Similar to the \\"Caught Live +5\\" track, \\"What Am I Doing Here?,\\" \\"Melancholy Man\\" makes for a beautifully dramatic dark Moody Blues' composition ... Just like \\"How Is It (We Are Here),\\" loads of interesting sounds and keyboard elements are featured on this particular Pinder tune. The combination of the wind (or \\"whirlwind\\") effects and the intense synthesizer sound, in the middle of the song, puts the \\"icing on the cake,\\" when it comes to following through with the theme of the song! Nice job with the backing vocals on thechoruses, mainly from Justin and Ray.<br /><br />\\"The Balance\\" made for the perfect poetic finale to the album ... The chorus is catchy and the instrumentation is arranged beautifully. Also, the individual band members' voices are heard, near the end of the song, as they take turns singing lines like, \\"Do you realize?,\\" \\"Yeah, yeah...,\\" and \\"Just open your heart.\\" Also, is that John singing in falsetto behind Mike's narration? :)<br /><br />In conclusion, ask no \\"questions\\" about adding this classic Moody Blues release to your audio library!

B000EHQ57Q|5.0|*The following comments are in regard to the bonus tracks on this release. To read my opinions on the original content of this album, check out my review under:<br /><br />\\"A Question of Balance\\" by The Moody Blues (Audio CD - 1997) - Original recording remastered<br /><br />Here is what I enjoyed about each of these outstanding bonus offerings...<br /><br />\\"Mike's Number One:\\"<br /><br />An upbeat and beautiful spiritual sounding Mike Pinder tune ... Based on the lyrics, this song could have been titled, \\"A Happening,\\" \\"Do You Know?,\\" or \\"See The Glory.\\" The track definitely has that \\"A Question Of Balance\\" sound to it, but it also would have made a fine addition to Mike's 1976 solo release, \\"The Promise,\\" or could have made a possible bonus track for that CD release. :)<br /><br />\\"Question\\" (alternate version):<br /><br />This mix is like an extended version of the single mix of the song ... The sound quality is outstanding on this mix, especially on the louder elements of the song. The track also comes to a full ending with somewhat of a Spanish-flavored guitar style, at the very end. :)<br /><br />\\"Minstrel's Song\\" (original mix):<br /><br />This is probably the least interesting of the bonus cuts, because the song fades in, on this occasion, with very faint vocals heard in the intro. The song also fades out in the exact same spot as the album mix, because while the final version fades into \\"Dawning Is The Day,\\" we can still hear The Moodies chanting \\"Around, around,\\" one last time, very faintly, at the beginning of \\"D.I.T.D.\\" The only positive side to this mix is that it is not cross-faded with the tracks that surround the song, on the final version.<br /><br />\\"It's Up To You\\" (original mix):<br /><br />Much like the single and \\"Best Of\\" (Ex: \\"The Best Of The Moody Blues,\\" \\"Gold\\") mixes of \\"The Story In Your Eyes,\\" from \\"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour,\\" this version of \\"It's Up To You\\" is similar to the original album version, but the instrumentation near the end of the track is carried on a little bit further, before the fadeout ... It's good \\"ear candy\\" which listeners haven't heard before. :)<br /><br />\\"Don't You Feel Small\\" (original mix):<br /><br />This version has an extended beginning AND ending to it! The instrumental lead-in, at the beginning, is awesome, and sounds similar to the instrumental fadeout, near the end of the song ... Nice job on the guitars, mellotrons, and percussion, all at the same time! :)<br /><br />\\"Dawning Is The Day\\" (full original mix):<br /><br />Same format as the previous mix (above), and the deleted material sounds just as great! :)<br /><br />In addition, the CD booklet, that accompanies this release, provides readers with the details on the controversial album cover to this LP (rear sleeve) ... Check out this release to get the full story (Page 13). Fans who own both this CD release and the 1997 CD remaster will notice that this version features the artwork that was changed while the 1997 version features the original artwork.<br /><br />Just like the 1997 CD remaster of \\"A Question of Balance,\\" this Deluxe Edition also featured a topnotch remastering job! I would recommend this release to any Moody Blues fan or collector. Thanks for reading! God Bless... :)track is carried on a little bit further, before the fadeout ...

B000001G16|4.0|After achieving so much with their band, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora decided to go their own ways and see what they could do as solo artists. Jon Bon Jovi's Blaze of Glory proved to be an immediate success, both musically and commercially; while Sambora released his debut a year later to mixed reviews. Although the average Bon Jovi fan took to the album right away, from a commercial standpoint, it didn't earn Sambora quite what he may have hoped for. Regardless, musically, Stranger in This Town is a terribly overlooked gem, and it exudes unadulterated songwriting brilliance.<br /><br />Behind Richie Sambora, there are two of his long-time band mates: David Bryan on keyboards and Tico Torres on drums. Torres' playing strictly serves the purpose of the songs; he doesn't really do any lengthy drum acrobatics, but there are pieces that allow him to shine through. Bryan, on the other hand, is integral to the overall sound of the album, as his keyboards are, at some point, the defining factors of the songs. Also, he co-wrote two tracks: the beautiful album intro \\"Rest in Peace\\", a wonderful song based on profound blues licks and Sambora's emotive vocals; and the ambitious title track, which sees the duo merging nifty acoustic guitars with delicate synth lines. Bryan is also highly audible on the truly moving ballad \\"Father Time\\", complete with Desmond Child's signature hooks, distant female vocals, and a warm melodic edge.<br /><br />Though a solo album, only three of the ten songs were written entirely by Richie Sambora. \\"Church of Desire\\" is the mid-paced piece, centred around moody keyboards and blues-inflected guitar riffs. The song is carried by a thick bass groove, and Sambora's guitar solo is truly heartfelt and emotional. On \\"River of Love\\", Tony Levin's bass arpeggios become central to the piece, especially when supported by Torres' spare drum beats. Finally, \\"Mr Bluesman\\", by many known as the album's minor hit, Sambora's greatest influence, Eric Clapton, makes a guest appearance playing an improvised blues solo where he rips it up. Despite its five-minute running time, even Torres gets to play a brief drum solo, yet it's all within the context of the song and the writing is truly impressive.<br /><br />That said, the album being more on the blues rock spectrum of things didn't really produce any radio hits. Actually, Sambora did collaborate with Desmond Child on two tracks, one of them being \\"Rosie\\", arguably the most popular cut off of this track. Also co-written by Jon Bon Jovi, the piece has a solid hook, but truth be told, it does not gel that well with the rest of the pieces, which seem more honest and from the heart. Likewise, \\"One Light Burning\\" might have been his take on poppier songwriting; he tries to merge cool beats and percussion work with Randy Jackson's bass playing whilst injecting the piece with a sing-along main chorus, but it doesn't really work -- Sambora is simply more of a blues-ridden rock guitarist than someone who can churn out easily accessible melodies. That's obviously Jon Bon Jovi's strong side.<br /><br />Stranger in This Town is in many ways better than most of the Bon Jovi catalog. Even after sixteen years, most of the songs are still timeless and still imbued with emotional power. It's also filled with material we'd normally never hear on a Bon Jovi release, so kudos to Sambora. He was totally right when he wrote that \\"listening instruction\\" in the liner notes: \\"Turn down the lights, light a candle... Welcome...\\"pearance playing an improvised blues solo where he rips it up.

B000002WYT|5.0|This was the first DMB album I listened and it just keeps suprinsing me. Every time I hear it, I find something new as if it was posible for each song to sound diferent each time. If you've never listen DMB, this is a sure bet!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This is a really classy album of hits.  I love the smooth mellowness of Michael's voice.  He has a way of making every song he sings sound perfect.  If you have been waiting for a classy singer and performer, wait no longer.  Buy this album and sit back for awhile.  I guarantee it will relax you and put you in a good mood.  You'll have a smile on your face!!
B00005A46U|4.0|As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\" I am often asked to give thoughts on various rock and roll recordings from the 60's and 70's.<br /><br />Caravan entered their golden period with this release (Their 2nd) in 1970.  This album and the next three:<br /><br />In The Land Of Grey And Pink<br /><br />Waterloo Lilly<br /><br />For Girls Who Grow Plump In The Night<br /><br />showed the group at their best.  While some would call them progressive rock it is closer to the Progressive/Psychedelic Canterbury Sound.<br /><br />You may have been told how strong a guitar-player Pye Hastings is but he should also be applauded along with bass-player Richard Sinclair for perfectly placed and phrased vocals.<br /><br />The album is consistant throughout.  The track that has been given the most notice since its release is \\"For Richard\\" but please don't think they are a one trick pony.  Caravan will grab your attention as soon as the opening cut is coming from your speakers and you'll receive some excellent bonus tracks to further bring you into the fold.<br /><br />Caravan can also be respected greatly because they had a sound in mind and weren't concerned with record company pressure to get them more airplay.<br /><br />Once the last notes play of this fine release you will be wanted the other three mentioned albums.<br /><br />Be well always,<br /><br />Craig Fenton<br /><br />Author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\"
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I come to review albums from an odd perspective:  First, the songwriting. I start by considering the worst, or my least favorite tracks.  My least favorite song at this point is probably \\"Good News First\\".  Of course, that's a relative statement, and having said that I think \\"Good News First\\" is a very good song.  If the worst (or more accurately \\"least favorite\\") song is very good, then what about the rest of the album?  Near perfect.      While I am a fan of every album Rush has ever released, there is usually a track or two I'm not that fond of on each album.  \\"Freeze\\" from Vapor Trails, and \\"You Bet Your Life\\" from Roll the Bones, serve as examples.  They're not BAD songs, but they don't do much for me.  That isn't the case at ALL with Snakes and Arrows.  Even the least attractive songs are NOT worth skipping.  And for those stuck in the 70's, there's no \\"Rivendell\\"  - arguably the worst song Rush ever recorded.      As for the production, I consider this to be yet another progressive reinvention of their sound.  This album is the only album I can think of that uses acoustic on nearly every song without making it seem like an acoustic album.  The use of texture in tone and the layering of guitar sounds on this album is about as immaculate as it can get.      Like most new albums, it has taken several listens to fully appreciate what Rush has produced.  This album is worth every star it can get!
B000056JYB|5.0|As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\" I am often asked to write or talk about various 60's and 70's rock and roll recordings.<br /><br />Although it was devastating that Cream had broken up, Two-thirds of the band Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker surfaced along with Steve Winwood and Ric Grech in Blind Faith.  Although there would only be one album it has left its mark as a must own for any fan of blues-rock and Clapton or Winwood.<br /><br />The deluxe issue has such intense bonus material that it had to be extended to a two CD set.  \\"Can't Find My Way Back Home\\" and \\"Presence Of The Lord\\" have so much soul and emotion it could give a heart to the Tin Man.<br /><br />There isn't a bad moment from the opening note to the final bonus track.  Although you'll feel like a kid in a candy store and want to experience a bit of this and that, listen to the first six tracks on CD 1 straight through.  This will enable you to experience the music the way it was in 1969 and in the best quality.  After you are able to digest the brilliance of the album if you have any energy left go for the bonus tracks.  Some may have had the pleasure of hearing \\"Sleeping In The Ground\\" previously.  When you get to the Jams it will reaffirm why Clapton's output from the Yardbirds through Derek & The Dominos was nothing short of Herculean.<br /><br />Be well always,<br /><br />Craig Fenton<br /><br />Author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\"

It will be in the time capsule for not only being one of the finest progressive rock albums ever, one of the best initial efforts, but being one of the finest collection of instrumental and vocal craftsmanship the world will ever see.<br /><br />Greg Lake's vocals are above human quality.  His voice is an instrument.  While you have heard about Robert Fripp's expertise (Without question) on the guitar, an album of this magnitude needed a singer of Lake's skill.<br /><br />Michael Giles (You should never have stayed so obscure)  is one of the most underrated drummers ever.  He offers up the perfect beat and fills to go with Fripp's world class guitar style.<br /><br />Each track is an epic.  21st Century Schizoid Man- comes at you without warning with the power of a tornado and it leaves nothing in its path.<br /><br />I Talk To The Wind- is gentle but even in the quiet moments of this stellar song the lyrics carry a big stick.<br /><br />Epitaph- has the lyrics that never escape the listener.  Almost 40 years after the fact people remember<br /><br />\\"Knowledge is a deadly friend when no one sets the rules.<br /><br />The fate of all mankind I see is in the hands of fools.\\"<br /><br />Moonchild- the forgotten tune on the record with words that are so intense you'll want to repeat the track several times to soak it all in<br /><br />\\"Dropping circle stones on a sun dial<br /><br />Playing hide and seek<br /><br />With the ghosts of dawn<br /><br />Waiting for a smile from a sun child.\\"<br /><br />The Court Of The Crimson King- ends the mythical journey with even more of Pete Sinfield's lyrical masterpieces.

B00005OM4K|5.0|As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\" I am always asked to write or discuss rock albums/bands from the 60's and 70's.<br /><br />John Fogerty is a type of genius with a twist.  He was able to invent an entire lifestyle about the American South/Southwest/Bayou- before he left Northern California.<br /><br />There are only a handful of groups that must have a specific singer.  CCR was one.  Fogerty must take the microphone.  Every word convinces you that he was born on the bayou.  His guitar licks are tremendous and always fit the structure of the song.<br /><br />If you heard people tell you that this release didn't have the sound quality they were looking for I would like to give a counter point of view.  When CD's were first issued almost all of them lacked punch or a sound you felt to be warm and sincere.  So many years after the fact almost all of the plants/record companies have corrected this.  The quality is fine for the rock and roll it presents.<br /><br />You'll love going through all the studio releases and understanding while numerous people thought of Fogerty as a hit writing machine (YES and very well) the CCR album output is terrific in its own right.  The non radio songs are very powerful.  Fogerty will take you through the swamp, sprinkle some blues, and pay homage to sounds of the 50's and 60's.<br /><br />If you are going to make an investment in the CCR releases, you'll be proud to own this collection!

B000002UAU|5.0|I love this album from the Beatles. I love the album cover.  It is so unique and colorful. Every time I look at the  album cover, I count how many people I can recognize on it.  It is fun to spot famous people like actor Marlon Brando and psychologist Sigmund Freud on it.  Every track is a beloved classic.  The title track really pumps me up.  \\"Lucy In The Diamonds\\"is a song that continues to dare me to dream and set new goals in life.  \\"When I'm Sixty Four\\" is a catchy funny tune. I never thought that Paul McCartney would be so active and vital in his sixties.  \\"Lovely Rita\\" is a tribute to the working woman.  The piano playing on this track is superb.  \\"With A Little Help From My Friends\\" is an excellent song about friendship.  This song always makes me feel better when I'm feeling sad.  \\"A Day In The Life\\" is another good song here. This song is a reminder that life goes on no matter what happens around the world.  \\"Fixing A Hole\\" is a quirky sounding song. I love Paul's vocals and guitar playing on this track.  This is the Beatles at their best.

0812550757|5.0|...or fiction, for that matter.  Orson Scott Card has described this as \\"anthropological sci-fi,\\" but this label does not do the book credit.  This is a novel of ideas that is only incidentally a sci-fi novel.  Although the main theme of the book is the collision of cultures, Speaker for the Dead is a critique of the value-neutral hermeneutic of traditional social science.  Card argues that any real study of foreign humanity must be a dialog between equals - the foreign culture is not an object of examination but a collective human \\"subject\\" to be engaged.  To examine the foreign from a God-like perspective, under the cold lens of objectivity, is to subordinate it.  This sort of anthropologist must either patronize the foreign culture (by blindly celebrating its \\"difference\\" - without regard to the value of that difference) or demonize it (by denying its moral agency).  It is therefore the diplomat, Card argues, and not the cultural anthropologist, who is the true bridge to foreign cultures.<br /><br />This would have been a trenchant criticism of the anthropology of 50 years ago.  Both Margaret Mead and Franz Boaz are clearly echoed in the more foolish characters in this book.  And Card's thesis was still pretty poignant when this book was released in 1986.  But cultural relativism is today out of fashion in the academy, and contemporary social scientists will probably bristle at this book's characterization of their discipline.  Nevertheless, Speaker for the Dead is a very powerful rebuttal to the popular delusion that we somehow do a service to primitive cultures when we isolate them, idealize them, and refuse to hold them morally accountable.<br /><br />There are some weak points.  Ender Wiggin is a bizarre and improbable character.  In attempting to create a Nietzschean ubermensch, Card has universalized Ender to the point that he retains few distinctive personal qualities.  The ones that remain are unappealling: he is pushy, arrogant and melodramatic.  He is aggresively tolerant and yet fiercely judgmental.  This makes Ender a rather unlikely messiah, but Card does not do much to explain his mysterious charisma with the other characters in the book.  And the plot is also pretty slow, especially if you come to this book quick on the heels of Ender's Game.  Speaker for the Dead consitutes an abrupt change of narrative gears.  While Ender's Game was fast-paced, violent and maybe too short, Speaker is methodical, meditative, and maybe too long.  Read it anyway, because there is nothing else like it.olerant and yet fiercely judgmental.

B000NA28HU|2.0|I have not read this series of books although after hearing my movie going companion moan about how the story was butchered I'm inclined to read the books to see what I've missed. <br /> <br />Since I haven't read the books I went into the movie with an open mind and was totally disappointed.   <br /> <br />All of the elements of a great story were there, the hero on the quest forced to make the decision to move forward into a great adventure.  The mentor to the hero that is trying to redeem himself from his real or imagined lack of honor/courage.  The fair young princess (read - love interest) that that hero must rescue but is a feisty wench in her own right.  The evil king who betrayed all that was noble and good to seize power for himself.  The son of the evil king trying to redeem himself from the family heritage that has blackened his name.  And the band of rebels holed up in their secret hide-out awaiting their hero to come when the time is right to strike.  All good elements of an action/adventure yarn to keep you on the edge of your seat.  Star Wars did it (well Chapter 3 did), LOTR did it, Robin Hood did it, several times. <br /> <br />Eragon missed, big time.  The story was slow, the character development - weak at best, no sympathy for any of the characters was developed.  When Brom died I was relieved for Jeremy Irons to finally be out of the slow torture that is this movie.  The FX on the dragon and the magic spells rocked, but that can't carry a whole movie.  The plot never explained who Princess Arya is and her relation to the king or the court.  And what's with that dragon?  Is it solar powered that flying into the sun for 5 minutes changes a cat sized lizard into a dragon that can seat a well built teenager?  There were a lot of story elements that didn't make sense to me but frankly, I just didn't care. <br /> <br />My suspension of disbelief snapped about 20 minutes into the film.  After that it was an endurance trial to see whether the movie would end before I started laughing out loud. <br /> <br />For what it could have been, this was a big disappointment for a movie.  Try the book instead - [[ASIN:044023848X Eragon (Inheritance, Book 1)]]
0316018953|3.0|First, my favorite author IS Michael Connelly. I have read every book that he has published and introduced numerous friends to his work.  All became hooked. One thing that has always set him far above the pack, is that he NEVER fails to deliver. Unlike other best-selling authors he remained consistently great... at least until I purchased \\"Crime Beat,\\" a collection of articles Connelly wrote while he was a working journalist and crime reporter. <br /> <br />As a newspaper publisher, I understand that when a reporter is doing a series of stories on any subject, he or she must repeat some information in each consecutive article.  That is necessary when writing for a newspaper, but makes for a somewhat tedious format when made into a book. (I'd rather read Ann Rule!) Although, \\"Crime Beat,\\" was not a particularly enjoyable read, I accepted it as \\"something different\\" and was glad to have it as part of Connelly's \\"roots.\\" <br /> <br />\\"The Overlook,\\" on the other hand, has me a little worried.  Yes, I liked it, but something was missing. It didn't feel exactly right, nor was it as satisfying as the other Bosch novels.  Sort of like getting a fast food burger when you were expecting one right off a backyard grill.  <br /> <br />Apparently, \\"The Overlook\\" was first a 16 chapter serial for the New York Times Sunday Magazine, and re-written to create this novel. That may explain my disappointment with a few of the characters and obviously the length. Some things simply are not as good when \\"re-heated.\\" <br /> <br />Surely, Mr. Connelly doesn't need to make a quick buck...and granted any Connelly is better than no Connelly, but I pray this does not become a trend for him.  What's next, \\"co-authored books,\\" so he can turn out several a year?  I want big, pure, totally fresh Connelly and I am willing to wait for it.  Hopefully, that is what he will deliver next.  The man is immensely talented and should continue his career by serving only the very best.
B00005JPD0|2.0|There's one certainty to Tony Scott's \\"Déjà Vu:\\" It makes sense in only one way, and the movie never really addresses it, which either means the filmmakers assume you'll figure it out, or they're willfully confusing us. Its final act is more or less inexplicable, and that makes it nearly impossible to recommend.\ <br /> <br />There are other ways to consider this science-fiction/thriller, I guess, because it's set in New Orleans, post-Katrina and post-9/11, because it involves terrorism mixed with toxic patriotism, because the letters ATF and FBI ignite some mixture of pride, fear, regret and anger in our collective memory. But you don't judge the quality of a steak dinner by the seasonal vegetables.  <br /> <br />A ferry explodes in the New Orleans port. ATF agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) investigates and quickly calls two shots: It was a bomb, and the man who planted in also killed a local woman named Claire (Paula Patton) for her Ford Bronco. Based one look at Claire in the morgue, Carlin falls in love with her.  <br /> <br />He falls even more in love when a secret FBI surveillance machine run by agent Przywarra (Val Kilmer) allows Carlin to look at Claire four-and-a-half days into the past in an attempt to find out when she came in contact with the terrorist.  <br /> <br />Written by Bill Marsilli and Terry Rossio, the first hour of \\"déjà vu\\" is thoughtful, compelling work. The writers devise a clever car chase 108 hours apart, as Carlin must follow the terrorist and dodge present-day cars as well, with mixed results. Washington is his typical cocky self, bellowing when pertinent, cracking a joke in the right spot. He's starting to enjoy the untucked shirt, Steven Seagal look too much, but he's an effective Everyman. Patton, the wife of singer Robin Thicke, makes a pretty damsel.   <br /> <br />But once Agent Carlin makes a key discovery about the machine, the script falls apart. Or, rather, it's been setting itself up for a hard fall since its firstscenes, and we're just realizing it. Events and evidence seen earlier in the movie are recycled in ways that seem, upon reflection, impossible unless - well, that's the secret of the movie.  <br /> <br />Good enough to say \\"déjà vu\\" plays the idea of changing the past without making enough of a commentary on (numerous, and possibly infinite) alternate realities; Marsilli and Rossio seem more intent on driving to a predictable, boring climax that's little more than a shootout.  An argument between two FBI technicians (Adam Goldberg and Erika Alexander) seems to hold the key to explaining movie last 30 minutes, but it doesn't do so with any real satisfaction.  <br /> <br />We, and a major character, are left with the idea that something's \\"weird.\\" That's not enough. The movie makes a choice to be more than its roots in voyeurism and crook-catching after-the-fact, and, so it can be clever in the most basic way - viewers are expected to think or say out loud \\"Ohhhhhhh yeaaaaah\\" several times, apparently - it cheats the parameters of its own logic. Why? Don't ask me. Just don't bother.
1582701709|4.0|I valued all the contributors who wrote content for this book.  I found the subject matter to be useful, relevant and timely to my life.  I used to think \\"positive thinking\\" was a superficial thing, but this book makes a compelling case for how deep and far-reaching it really is.
B000002OX3|3.0|This is one of those reissues on which the &#34;bonus tracks&#34; can really distract the listener. The original vinyl issues (in the States with the single version of &#34;Happy Jack&#34; -- not on this cd-- instead of the cover of &#34;Heatwave&#34;) was fun at the time even with the utter silliness of &#34;Cobwebs . . . &#34; The highlights at the time included a few tracks that could have been on the band's first lp (&#34;Run Run Run&#34; and &#34;So Sad About Us&#34;), two John Entwhistle tunes (&#34;Boris the Spider,&#34; if you can imagine, was part of the band's live set), and the melodramatic swamp of sexual retardation &#34;A Quick One.&#34; Despite its limitations and a few high points, that track did a lot to break the band and pop music out of its three minute or under stagnation. It may be difficult to take it too seriously today, but its presentation as a mini-opera raised the idea in young listeners' minds about the possibility of listening to opera (non-mini works by legitimate composers.) Now for the so-called bonus material . . . again some of it interesting (the demo of &#34;Happy Jack&#34;), some of it contemporary (the b-sides to some of the early singles), some it shyte (the &#34;Ready-Steady-Who&#34; ep.) If the original lp lacked cohesion (are they hard-hitting British mods or silly twats?), the added material to someone whose looking to understand the development of the band might decide on the latter rather than the former.  If you know the material, you might just think back to the early days when they were an opening act, &#34;I was young and they were The Who&#34;; if you're looking to understand the band, you're best programing your music player so you learn the original album before listening to the largely substandard extras.
B000LXH0AE|3.0|Two things lead me to believe that this movie would be funnier then it was. One, the fact that it starred Will Ferrell, though that can be blamed on my own assumptions, and two, the previews, which showed only the funny bits of the movie, and led me to believe that this was just a comedy. <br /> <br />It's not a comedy, it's a dramedy. There's a romance between Will Ferrell's character, and a baker his auditing. There's also what seems to be Natasha Richardson's character. <br /> <br />The movie drags by it's middle act, and the ending could be better.
B000301YY8|2.0|Great idea it was to get back at an old girlfriend by selling her memory, but did you have to get back at listeners with a pretty boring set of unmemorable songs?<br /><br />Endless.  Maybe I'll leave this disc on the subway.
B00007AJF8|5.0|There aren't many films that will force you to think differently. This is one of those rare exceptions, and a funny one to boot.<br /><br />It explores the age-old question of what it would be like to be inside someone else's head (and body, with riotous gender switches).<br /><br />Great quote from Cameron Diaz, who plays Lotte Schwartz in this film: \\"It's been said that in Hollywood there are only 14 different scripts. Well, this is number 15.\\"<br /><br />A film to be watched in one sitting, it is the perfect entertainment for a Friday evening, after a tough week.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Once you've seen it, read [[ASIN:044900371X The Orchid Thief: A True Story of Beauty and Obsession (Ballantine Reader's Circle)]] by Susan Orlean and then watch [[ASIN:B00005JLRE Adaptation (Superbit Collection)]], the follow-on film by Spike Jonze.
630542828X|4.0|This is an interesting and educational movie, and is a good portrayal of what happens to human health when environmental regulations are non-existent or not enforced.  I use this in my classes, but also enjoy the film from a recreational standpoint. It's worth a look!
0743277457|5.0|I bumped into josh a few times when he was going through some of his late formative experiences in the book, and it was great. we'd do this excercise like play combat called push hands, I would land dazed and confused on the mat wondering how I got thrown. I'd drive back to jersey convinced next time would be different, but it never was. With penetrating insight he rapidly mastered this stuff. He raised the bar in  class. I thought it was fun, but convinced myself it wasn't useful enough to fully invest in it. This book, in a sense, seems to be about full investment, first in chess, then in martial arts, then more broadly in life. It explores the pitfalls of labeling a talent instead of striving for it,  excess work without fun, of seeking to win instead of to learn, and many others. Some self help stuff is written in a mealy mouthed style that leaves you sleepy. This is not.  I bought one for myself, one for my bright teenage nephew. Very happy with it.   thanks for the book!!   -jb
B000ERU5EK|2.0|I have heard these guys play before live there are off the chain . It was a little to soft for me But ok . I think they put way to many vocal songs on the cd but over all they did a good job . It was ok but not the best cd over all put in 2006 far from it .
B000MXPE7O|1.0|This movie stank. It was boring, so boring I would rather have watched a cia agent pick their nose for three hours. the story was slow, some of the facts fictionalized, and the filming shakey. The skull and bones stuff is somewhat on target with the founding, i would argue, but the rest of it is just bad. There were too many possible storylines that could have been followed, but were not. They just hung there for a little bit and were ignored. simply very, very bad.
B00003CXMG|3.0|I truly enjoyed this film, over-enjoyed it in fact.  There are far too many wonderful scenes, great joints of dialogue, and an overflow of brooding young men and women.  I felt like I had no character on which to focus my sympathy.  I wanted to focus on the perspective of the young writer, William Miller (played expertly by Patrick Fugit), but the film wouldn't let me.  I wanted to envision Russell Hammond (played genuinely by Billy Crudup), but I couldn't decide if he was a rock star, a little boy trapped in a man's body, or a surrogate father to William.  I didn't understand Kate Hudson's Oscar nomination, but I understood Frances McDormand's.  And why the hell Philip Seymour Hoffman wasn't nominated, I'll never understand.  Something was going on in this movie that confused me. <br /> <br />I think the greatest flaw in this movie - the theatrical version, at least - is that there are simply too many great performances and too many fascinating characters for the film to center itself.  I'm positive that the director's cut is the version to see.  The theater cut was pieced together with an air of sadness in order to meet a marketable time limit.  I felt like I was missing a lot of back-story, supporting roles, and important moments.  If you have never seen this movie, avoid the theatrical version.  It is severely dismembered, and it's clear that the director (Cameron Crowe) had more to show the viewer.  The director's cut is over forty minutes longer, and I look forward to seeing it. <br /> <br />I probably should at least attempt to place this movie.  The film covers the 1973-74 tours of the band Stillwater.  There were an actual band back then, but the majority of their representation is fabricated for the sake of the movie.  Most of the music in the film is representative of the time period and not so much from the band.  Thus, this is not a true biopic, but an imagined biopic, a movie about a band that was, as the title states, almost famous.
B0002NRQTI|5.0|I completely agree with the reviewer named Chris. Counterparts is definitely one of Rush's finest albums. I also agree that the lyrics on this album are among Peart's best. I think it's definitely the best album since Moving Pictures. I don't really have anything interesting or original to say here. I just wanted to voice my agreement that this album is a rock masterpiece.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I don't know what's more incredible about Rush; The fact that they are in their mid-50's and still touring and putting on flawless 3 hour shows or the fact that they have delivered yet another modern day masterpiece akin to 2002's Vapor Trails, which remains one of the band's finest moments. <br /> <br />While VT has the slightly better songs, Snakes & Arrows delivers crisper sound quality and a better overall production and listening experience.  The lyrics are outstanding as always and deal with some of drummer/lyricist Neil Peart's favorite topics - war, religion, faith and a gamut of other emotions that make up the basis of the overall theme - humanity and trying to survive in these trying times. <br /> <br />Texturally, this is a very rich record, with plenty of acoustic guitars and layered vocals, however keyboards are once again used at a very minimum.  It is a very \\"moody\\" sounding record and Geddy's vocals range from urgent to melodious and at times very soulful.  I have heard complaints about the marriage of the lyrics to the vocals, but IMO Geddy only continues to get better at this as his sense of melody continues to grow. <br /> <br />Songwise, there are several standouts that qualify as modern day Rush masterpieces.  The lead track \\"Far Cry\\" is a powerful opener with a contagious chorus that sticks in your head for days.  \\"Armor & Sword\\" is a  moody mid-tempo piece that contains the unforgettable \\"Nobody gets to their heaven without a fight\\" lyric.  \\"Workin' Them Angels\\" is another lyrical highpoint as Neil thanks his spiritual guardians for allowing him to live on the edge for all these years, while Alex Lifeson provides the  <br />wall of guitars and then a mandola solo - the perfect Rush song. <br /> <br />Other highlights include \\"The Way The Wind Blows\\" which starts out with a  <br />killer blues riff from Lifeson before the band lock into a serious groove   <br />that shows them musically in peak form.  \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" is the best of the 3 instrumentals here however \\"Malignant Narcissism\\" could have been equally effective if not for it only being 2 minutes long. Both are not to be missed. <br /> <br />It truly is incredible that a band this deep into their career is making music as good as this.  A true sign that this is one of the most gifted rock bands of all-time.
B00005QCVY|5.0|This is a classic film and should be in everyone's holiday DVD collection. The 50th Anniversay Edition is superb with excellent sound and picture. The 60th Anniversay is the same print,but on the one I viewed,there were some annoying audio pops in a couple of spots! Buy the 50th Ann. Ed. it is well worth looking for. One of the best holiday movies ever made!
B00006LI26|5.0|Back when this album came out, I remember how some publications slagged it off by saying HELLOWEEN were ripping off METALLICA and IRON MAIDEN. Funny to see, some 20 years later, that their brand of Heavy Metal is the most aped formula in the Epic/Power Metal movement. Back in 1985, HELLOWEEN were a Thrash band with a huge knack for writing memorable melodies and devastating thrash riffs and harmonies. Unlike fellow German thrashers like DESTRUCTION or KREATOR, HELLOWEEN preserved a lot of traditional metal in their DNA, with virtually no punk or hardcore overtones (except, maybe, the frantic pace of most of the songs here in). <br />\\"Ride The Sky\\", \\"Heavy Metal is the Law\\" and the thrashing closer, \\"How many tears\\" are staples of speed/thrash metal. The vocals of Kai Hansen will please MAIDEN fans and the drumming of Ingo (R.I.P.), with its frenzied double bass mayhem, will surely please most thrashers. <br />The album has lost NONE of its impact and in no way does this sound dated (this is, after all, power metal defined!). <br /> <br />Do yourselves a favor and buy this album right now!!!
B000K7VHPU|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I saw this movie... I had heard nothing about it nor seen any trailers for it. From the first scene, I was a bit sceptical but I was quickly drawn in.  Ed Norton's Eisenheim was brilliant and the illusions were amazing. The love he had for Sophie (Jessica Biel) was  heart warming, this love he carried for her since they were kids.<br /><br />I was so caught up in the story that I didn't even see the end coming.  Great movie, great cast!
0743487761|5.0|I picked up this book largely due to fond memories of [[ASIN:0743487591 Pride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics)]], but I found Sense & Sensibility is an excellent novel in its own right.  I don't know why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry but the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and only get better as it goes along.<br /><br />The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness.  Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility).  How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book.  They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were.  The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good.  There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.<br /><br />I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending.  I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.<br /><br />In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading.  The Enriched Classic edition also has excellent notes to help you understand references or words that may be hard to decipher more than 200 years after the book was written and I found this very helpful.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|2007 is the year that Megadeth finally release an all out quality metal. All the songs have bits of classic Megadeth sound. The re-release of the \\"A tout le monde\\"(\\"Set me free\\") with Cristina Scabbia is quite better than the original. Recommended

6305736650|5.0|Casablanca, of course, doesn't require a review from me--the entire world knows about it.  So I'll make this short and to the point. <br /> <br />PROS: <br /> <br />1.  Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid and that darn French Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains) star.  That's two stars right there. <br /> <br />2.  Some of the best writing Hollywood (we called it Hollywood in those days instead of Harletwood) ever produced.  That's a star. <br /> <br />3.  Some of the best music ever mastered for a movie--the world still remembers it a zillion years later.  That's another star. <br /> <br />4.  When you consider the idea is actually a simple love triangle during World War Two how could it have attained such greatness...well of course anyone who has ever seen it already knows, it was the writing, directing, acting, and music.  Oh yes, Peter Lorre stars in it and several others you will reconize such as Sydney Greenstreet.  I could go on and on about this movie, take it apart and tell about how great the writing, and acting are, but have you seen how many reviews this thing has?  Besides, you all don't need this country boy to tell you about THIS movie.  Moving along, that's a star right there, a really low end idea that came out 'great'.  Proof once again, if you got the idea, writing, your actors can act, and your director can director, (and a fine song or two) nothing else really matters. <br /> <br />CONS: <br /> <br />1.  There are no CONS: in this movie, I can suggest no updating, no changing of script, idea, directing, acting or anything to make it better.  It's such a good thing Hollywood had a long list of actors to choose from--I don't think they could have pulled it off without them...I'm watching it again as I write this, that darn French Captain kind-a grows on you, and to think HE turns out to be a sentimentalist to! <br /> <br />I will add one last thing, Casablanca is not a popcorn movie like I usually watch (the old Science Fiction and monster movies).  It can not be watched like a regular popcorn movie.  No.  It's script, acting, directing goes too far for such trival things as simple entertainment.  You must listen to each word, study their body language, watch their eyes as you watch the movie.  And just remember...this movie was filmed and I believe shown as Casablance was \\"actually\\" being invaded by the darkest shadow this world had faced in its' ten thousand years of recorded history...and they almost won. <br /> <br />If I weren't a Christian I would have said you need a shot of gin and a cigarrette...but I am, and most snack foods just don't do credit to this movie.  You decide. <br /> <br />So there it is, rated as the second greatest movie ever made, and not one s--t, not one cuss or swear word, not one exploding head and almost no special effects.  Casablanca can only be described one way and with one word...Art.  Bye!
0446528056|5.0|I liked this book because it didn't have the typical ending.  From the minute I picked this book up I was hooked (as I am with most of his books I read).

B00000ILDF|1.0|I watched this movie at the theaters when I was a kid and I was a big fan of Aliens (2). I collected the Aliens 2 model kits, the Aliens movie poster, I collected the Dark Horse published Aliens comic book as a kid, played the Aliens arcade games, and Aliens vs Predator PC Games (later on as a college student). Aliens 3 ruined the entire series. They did not have to kill off Newt, Bishop, and Corporal Hicks. That is the worst thing to have happened in this movie. Everything that Ripley did in the Aliens (2) was in vane. I agree that this is a slap in the face to James Cameron's last movie.  Other people here giving this movie 3, 4 or 5 stars is just mind-boggling. This is a good example of what happens when some greedy studio executives (who doesn't have a clue and are only interested in making money through sequels) dictate how a movie should be made instead of the director himself. I hope those Fox executives got fired for ruining this series. I know it's not the director's fault (David Fincher) but they should have let Ridley Scott and/or James Cameron continue directing this series since the first two movies was their baby. Maybe they could have used the Aliens comic book mini-series published by Dark Horse to make an off shoot script for the movie. Or they could have stopped at Aliens 2 and gone on with Aliens vs Predator with Ridley Scott and/or James Cameron maybe directing it.

B00005JKNF|5.0|Well played and pleasant but absolutely sinister. D.H Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover in reverse. Lady Chatterley is in fact a Lord. And everything is different. The Lord has the right to have as many affairs with the female servants as he wants. He has the right to have as many children with these female servants as he wants and then to have the babies abandoned and sent to orphanages. Absolutely disgusting. And what's more he may keep the servants for further use eventually. When we know that we know the murder of the Lord will be accepted by everyone in his own social class as justified, that they will cover it up for the police not to find out the murderer. And what's more they will have been backboneless enough not to murder him themselves and let the servants murder him. Here Robert Altman imagines a thriller that becomes a vicious denunciation of the deepest hypocrisy you can imagine, that of the British aristocracy. There is little to add to this tale, except that all in all only the servants have the human dignity that provides them with some human feelings, including for the son that has managed to survive and is condemned to remain officially unknown. It is also the servants who have the liking and taste for the Hollywood sentimental and sentimentalese songs that are sung for the entertainment of the ladies and gentlemen who treat that music as some charming accompaniment for their simmering hatred of the world and themselves. Of course Altman also manages to put one note against the Americans in the two characters from California, one having a typically non-Anglo-Saxon name, viz. Weissman. They are vicious enough to infiltrate the servant quarters just for the sake of a film on the very same situation, hence to guarantee the realism of the servants' side of the film. But they are also gross enough to reveal the subterfuge before the end and that reveals too how much the servants hate this indiscretion that reveals their side of ,the household to someone from the other side of the household. The gap between the two social classes that live along to one another in this mansion is wider than the distance between the earth and the moon.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonnene from the other side of the household.

B000NA2BEU|1.0|I think it's kind of telling that the third season could barely pull two million viewers. A lot of the characters I enjoyed watching (Wallace, Weevil, Mac, Lamb, etc.) were relegated to appearing once every 6 episodes or so. Veronica's still snarky and bitter even though she's had no reason to be since Season 1. Jason Dohring puts in a performance as Veronica's doormat. All I can say for the third year is hey, the new opening credits looked nice, and maybe there are a good 3 or 4 episodes in the lot. Veronica might have been better off if it had been like Freaks & Geeks - brilliant but ended way too early after only one year. By the end of Season 3 it really was more like \\"Why is this show still on the air?\\"

B00003CWPL|5.0|I've watched several David Lynch films before and now that I've finally watched Eraserhead, I feel that I have a deeper understanding of Lynch and his films.    I think a lot of people who have watched Eraserhead have probably said, \\"What the hell was that?  That was boring, pointless, pretentious and made no sense whatsoever.\\"  On the other end of the spectrum, many people might try to find some meaning with the film and try to make sense of Eraserhead in terms of it's imagery and the narrative.    I think they're both missing the point.    Eraserhead is a film that you surrender yourself to and absorb.  It's a work of art, a dark, surreal painting with real people that has been committed to film.  It's a gateway into the psyche and unconsciousness of a young artist (at the time) named David Lynch.  The film is an experience - probably as close as you'll ever get to being able to watch someone's darkest, strangest dream unfold on your home theatre.    So is it good art?  I think so.  Good art should provoke a reaction in the person experiencing it, and Eraserhead certainly did that for me.  It left me feeling unsettled and bewildered but at the same time I had the thrill of knowing I had just watched something completely unique, haunting, funny and in it's own weird way, beautiful.    Of course, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Eraserhead certainly isn't for everyone, but I recommende it for film buffs, David Lynch fans and anyone who thinks movies can be more than just mindless entertainment.
B000O174CM|5.0|2006's \\"Dreamgirls\\" shares much in common with 1985's \\"The Color Purple\\": a film with a mostly-black cast helmed by a white director (the latter guided by Bill Condon and the former by Steven Spielberg), a story adapted from another medium (\\"Purple\\" from Alice Walker's bestseller and \\"Dreamgirls\\" from the Broadway hit), a running time of over two hours (\\"The Color Purple\\" at 154 minutes while \\"Dreamgirls\\" runs at only 131), and multiple Oscar nominations but with few or no wins (eleven for \\"Purple\\" with no wins, eight for \\"Dreamgirls\\" with only two wins).<br /><br />It is the latter reason that is the greatest injustice.  Though he was nominated for best supporting actor, Eddie Murphy lost to Alan Arkin in the category and that loss was one of Oscar's greatest blunders.  Murphy is spectacular as the over-the-top-soul-man James \\"Thunder\\" Early in what could truly be described as that proverbial \\"role of a lifetime.\\"  It's as though he was destined to play that part and he should have received an Oscar for his efforts.<br /><br />However, his is not the only ouststanding acting job in the film.  Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Anika Noni Rose, Keith Robinson, and, in a lesser yet pivotal role, Danny Glover, all deliver brilliant performances and, for that, the film presents one of the best ensembles of the year.<br /><br />This multi-disc compilation is a packaging wonder.  Sporting a version filled with an extended cut, featuring twelve not-in-the-theatrical-version songs, a plethora of bonus and entertaining features/featurettes, this, like the movie, is entertainment of the highest value.<br /><br />'Tis a shame that Oscar voters didn't quite see it that way.
B000002LMM|5.0|I love anything by Angelo Badalementi.  I bought this soundtrack in junior high.  It was my first all instrumental album.  I used to listen to it as I was falling asleep. <br /> <br />It's so eerie and melencholy.  I LOVE it!  All of the music from Twin Peaks was awesome!
1594489505|5.0|I read many books in a year.  Some I read for entertainment and others to increase my knowledge.  Then there is the rare book that does both of those things, plus touches your heart as well.  A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini does just that.  Hosseini's The Kite Runner was a magnificent book, and I enjoyed A Thousand Splendid Suns even more.<br /><br />Splendid Suns follows the lives of two Afghani women, Mariam and Laila, as they move from children to adults.  The book spans 30 years, beginning with the Soviet invasion and ending with the overthrow of the Taliban.  It's difficult to explain more of the story without spoiling the plot, but these two women go from being enemies to unlikely friends.  A Thousand Suns is a moving story about the power of love, the bonds of friendship, the love of country, and the struggle to survive.  I hated to see it end.<br /><br />I like books that teach me something, and there is a lot to learn in Splendid Suns.  Previously, I didn't know much about the political turmoil in Afghanistan and the various factions vying for power.  I knew women had an appalling time living under the Taliban regime, but I didn't realize how horrible conditions really were.  The childbirth section will fill you with horror.  I also learned of the natural beauty of Afghanistan and her fascinating history.<br /><br />I was especially moved by Hesseini's eloquent writing and observations.  In writing of friendship, \\"Boys, Laila came to see, treated friendship the way they treated the sun: its existence undisputed; its radiance best enjoyed, not beheld directly.\\"  There aren't too many writers who can produce back-to-back masterpieces.  Khaled Hosseini is one of those rare talents who can pull off such a feat.
0307010856|4.0|I bought this book for my daughter (age 2) who doesn't watch much sesame street and who has a fetish for cookie monster diapers.  So, to have her become more familiar with another character, I bought this book.  I remember reading it when I was little (and I'm over 40!).  Anyway, she LOVES this book.  Now, we refer to Grover as \\"the monster at the end of this book.\\"  My boys had to come see what all the excitement was about when I was reading it to her and the liked it alot, too (ages 7 and 5).  It is a fun book to read and the kids enjoy it, so that makes me happy.
0439813786|5.0|It was true serendipity;I was heading up a book club for 11-12 year old girls at the same time Al Roker started his. I purchased this book and distributed it to the girls at our first meeting.  Their eyes popped and jaws dropped when they saw the 2\\" spine, but the abundant illustrations got them hooked.  This book is perfect for the reluctant reader. Kids fly through it. You read a little, and then the next few pages tell the story through the beautifully detailed black and white illustrations. The following text picks up from where the illustrations (not the previous text) left off. The story is wonderfully told for adults as well as kids. The entire book club loved it and it proved to the reluctant readers that they could easily tackle a big book!
B00008977N|5.0|you know this concert was loaned to me by a friend after a shoulder surgery to watch while I recovered. I waited and waited to watch it. Well I just wasn't that excited about Peter Gabriel in concert. one night the wife and I finally popped it in the VCR and proceeded to wear out 5 VCR copies of this fabulous show! I waited for quite a few years to finally see it go to DVD While still recovering I got to see Paula cole  in Concert here locally and it too was a good show. This is right up there with \\"Pulse\\" Not in light wattage but in showmanship!!! It is simply great!! I have bought more of Peter's Concerts since and like them all!! <br />Our niece who was 7 at the time liked going to sleep every night to this concert the summer she stayed with us!!
0517123207|5.0|I liked the edition very much. Its legibility is very nice and it's a lightweighted version, dispite its 470 pages. I was just disapointed with the illustrations, that have very little relation to the text. But this fact doesnt compromise the quality of the whole. And the content... well, it's darwin world changing work, very readable.
B00005JLFC|5.0|I agree, why hasn't this awesome film been put on <br />DVD?  And even adapted for the broadway stage?  This <br />story and music is to good just to remain on film. <br />Bring it to the broadway stage and let the music <br />live on!  Talk about \\"moments you'd remember all <br />of your life\\"....seeing this on broadway and DVD... <br />....would be one of those moments!
B000IFQLSW|5.0|A great record of this thirty year old musician, which besides singing very well plays the guitar wonderfully although in this album Shepherd doesn't sing. Shepherd began playing guitar at five and at thirteen made his debut in a live concert with the singer and guitarist Bryan Lee (his reunion is recorded: \\"Bryan Lee - Live At The Old Absinthe House Bar....Saturday Night\\", and makes a very good record).  \\"10 Days Out\\" this sensational live album  contains great themes as by instance \\"Little Red Rooster\\" one of the better classical and outstanding Blues song ever composed by maecenas of Blues, Willie Dixon, that by the way The sensational Rolling Stones made an extraordinary cover in the first 60's, in addition to assembling a quantity of top musicians like  Cootie Stark and Neal \\"Big Daddy\\" Pattman, Jerry \\"Boogie\\" McCain, B.B.King, Bryan Lee, Clarence \\"Gatemouth\\" Brown (one of the better of all the times a true number one), Henry Townsend, Etta Baker, Henry Gray, Hubert Sumlin ( the permanent  guitarist of another monster, HOWLIN WOLF),  \\"Wild Child\\" Butler, Pinetop Perkins (one of the better Blues pianist alive and one of the better of all the times). It is perhaps the best of his discography and for sure the one with the purest Blues contents.   Highly recommended. I give it 5 stars.
B0002S947K|5.0|This album is soulful, deep and thick.  His voice will melt your worries away.
B000OCXFCO|3.0|The album is OK.  First song is good.  Boring overall.  OK album.  BUT...      THESE ARE NOT REAL DRUMS.      I'm SO tired of people using programs like \\"Drumkit From Hell\\" to program drums on metal albums.  They are INSTANTLY recognizable.  And, they suck.  Fake.    Other bands that have done this lately...Exodus, Black Label Society, and King Diamond.      Don't believe me?  Then you don't have the ears to tell the difference.    It's easiest to tell on the King Diamond albums, such as \\"The Puppet Master.\\"  King forgot to turn off the fake tambourine click track that goes along with EVERY song.  Combine this with the by the book drum beat and cymbal hits (cymbal hits which have NO variation in amplitude, pitch, modulation, or sound variance AT ALL) and this is a no-brainer.  Not real.  Not played.    Listen to the hi-hats on any more recent albums by these bands...every hit sounds exactly the same.  It's funny on the BLS songs...where the hi-hat is programmed to \\"close,\\" they mistakenly forgot to omit the actual \\"open\\" hi-hat sound sample after the \\"closed\\" hi-hat sound is triggered.  If this were a real hi-hat, the \\"open\\" sound would STOP completely when the hi-hat was \\"closed.\\"  This doesn't happen.  This is impossible on real drums.  Guitar players usually don't care...they care about the solo.  Clueless about the other instruments 90% of the time.    Also, the drums are programmed in the most basic way possible.  It's a ridiculous conundrum...the bass drums are programmed in this super fast super heavy double bass classic metal beat, but the hi-hats, snare, cymbals, and ride are programmed to do the most simple, trite, straight elementary beats that only a non-drummer would program (similar to a straight beat on a drum machine for guitar players to solo over).      Listen to the ridiculous drums in the first song on this album.  NO drummer would ever actually play like that.  Some amazing fill, then followed by the most basic beat, where cymbals hit ALWAYS atthe same time at the end of a measure (what drummer ONLY hits cymbals the SAME way in EVERY song at the END of EVERY measure?), snare rolls are totally mechanical with no feeling, and some fills are just SO basic that you think, \\"Wait, no GOOD drummer would EVER just do that.\\"  On this album, when the little blast beat fills occur...nothing short of hip-hop could sound any more fake.    The SOUND of the digital samples is decent...but they need to be programmed by a drummer who has a clue of HOW a real drummer plays in a thrash/metal context.      These bands will NEVER admit to using drum programmers/machines.  King still denies it (he even still tries to state the horrendous \\"drums\\" on \\"The Eye\\" were actually played on an electronic kit which is total BS...those drum sounds were programmed on a primitive digital machine).  The last several King albums (as well as Mercyful Fate's \\"In the Shadows\\" except \\"Return of the Vampire\\") have had programmed drums, and while 1000% better than the \\"Eye\\" drums, they still sound 100% fake...and King wonders why everyone lusts for the days of Mickey Dee's REAL drum fills. People CAN tell the difference...if they just think and LISTEN for themselves and not believe everything they are told and spoon-fed as fact.     It is MUCH cheaper to program the drums for an \\"artist.\\"  However, REAL drums can have just as much feel as a good soulful guitar solo.  A good analogy would be...what if the guitar solos were replaced by midi file programmed guitar solos that emulated amplified guitar sounds?  No feeling would result...and it's the same with all these bands using these cheezy programmed drums inserted via ProTools.      I yearn for the good old days when even if a band, album or a drummer sucked (i.e., someone like Randy Castillo, RIP), at least it was a REAL human with a REAL style (albeit a bad one) that you could IDENTIFY.      The new ProTools recording style and fake programmed drums RUIN music.  NO soul whatsoever.       How canhardly anyone else NOT be bothered by this?        Open your ears.  You'll be surprised by what you realize you are (and aren't) hearing.
B00005JPAO|3.0|It seems a little unfair to rate this movie with only three stars because the direction is assured, the script is intelligent, and the acting is workmanlike in all respects.  As other reviewers have noted, the movie covers the period between British Prime Minister Tony Blair's accession to 10 Downing Street (the home of the British leader) and the aftermath of the death of Princess Diana, formerly the wife of the British heir to the throne, Prince Charles.  The movie resists the temptation to score easy points.  Tony Blair is presented as a rounded character rather than the \\"Tony Blur\\" he was known as just prior to the 1997 election.  The Queen and the rest of the royal family and their retinue are clearly living in a time warp, utterly out of touch with the rest of humanity, yet the movie doesn't set them up just to knock them down.  In the end the Queen is seen as a tragic sort of character and Tony Blair develops a sincere admiration for her, even as he is frustrated by her inability to grasp the essentials of the situation she faces.<br /><br />So much, so good.  The drawbacks, however, are these: complex relationships have to be encapsulated and summed up in one scene or less.  Thus Prince Charles' resentment over his own childhood is force-fitted into a scene in a Land Rover where he implicitly criticises his mother the Queen by talking about how warm and loving and good a mother his ex-wife Diana was.  Likewise the Queen's sense of being trapped in a role she never wanted is summed up on a Scottish moor, where she sees a magnificent stag.  It represents the freedom she never knew.  No matter how well-intentioned these vignettes are, they are inevitably somewhat clumsy in a movie that is above all else trying to reconstruct real events.<br /><br />The second problem is that when the subjects of a movie are still very much alive and in place, any representation of them treads a fine line between caricature and irrelevance.  Actors have to mimic expressions and manners of speech rather than interpret roles according to their own strengths.  We are always uncomfortably conscious of the fact that the movie Queen looks very like, but not really exactly like, the real Queen.  Likewise the movie Blair is very like, but not really exactly like, the real Prime Minister.  This dissonance is reduced as much as possible by excellent direction, but it is never entirely absent.<br /><br />The result is a very enjoyable movie that brings real warmth and sympathy to almost all the characters we encounter, with the exception of Prince Phillip, husband to the Queen.  By all accounts the real Consort has few if any redeeming features so the movie reasonably enough doesn't stretch our credulity by trying to imply there might be some lurking deep out of sight.<br /><br />Definitely watch this movie if you have any interest at all in contemporary social events in Britain - it's probably as realistic a depiction of some fascinating people as we are likely to get.  But in the end, while it succeeds as a humanistic undertaking, it somehow just falls short as art.and manners of speech rather than interpret roles according to their own strengths.

B00004T8AC|1.0|Well I thought this might be good as I watch old black and white movies, tv shows ect....But it was not.  The thought of going back in time to the fifties is OK.  I realize that they needed to spice up the plot a little to appeal to a modern audience; but they chose to use casual sex, masturbation, and added a racist or racial overtone.  These choices did not make it a good movie at all.<br /><br />In addition to the crummy plot I was somewhat disturbed by the black and white town and people vs. the colored objects and people.  It's hard to describe my feelings here I guess.  But now whenever I see a commercial (or any video clip) that changes from black and white to color I am reminded of this horrible movie.  I would not recommend this movie.<br /><br />This was a long boring movie and casting Don Knots could not save this movie.  This plot is best viewed in a shorter half hour show like The Twilight Zone.
0312305060|4.0|The Hours is three narratives in one.  We have the tragic Virginia Woolf, Laura Brown, and the aptly named Clarissa.  Across generations, we witness one day in each of their lives.  I admit I was a bit disappointed in myself for not making the connections that were presented throughout the novel until the very final chapter.  The Hours is a poignant look at the beauty and tragedy of every day life.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Episode after episode, one thing is repeated while we watch...\\"that is amazing!\\"   <br /> <br />Huge bonus, my 3 year old loves it, so every now and then, rather than watching PBS Kids (which is also great, but can get a bit tired for an adult) before bed time, we watch Planet Earth.
B000MXPE74|5.0|This truly is an outstanding debut album. The writing is first rate; the best pop tunes are always hook-laden and fun and that's what is here. This is the most refreshing and exciting pop album in a very long time, in fact. If you like the energy of the early Beatles and the catchiness they had, this is for you. Every song is a lively, exciting pop confection. The band sounds like a cross between the Beatles, the Kinks and the Who and I say this as one who grew up with these bands. Bravo!
B000NA2776|1.0|I heard good things about this CD, and I liked the single \\"Grace Kelly\\". So, I decided to purchase the CD. When I listened to it I was very disappointed. The songs on it are weird, to say the least, and not in a good way. He is a self-admitted Freddy Mercury rip-off, and a VERY BAD one in my opinion.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|A fabulous collection of films.  This is nature in a way one rarely sees it as well as the 'behind the scenes' antics that resulted in the outstanding film. <br /> <br />Both entertaining and educational - hard to feel guilty about sitting in front of the television for an hour at a time.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I will start by saying that OK Computer is worth the money for the song \\"Let Down\\" alone.  In my opinion, this song is Radiohead's finest and I consider it one of the best songs recorded in the past 20 years.  Its complex layers of instrumentals and vocals build upon each other flawlessly to create the melancholy effect the Radiohead doubtlessly intended to create.  It is one of those rare songs that I never get sick of hearing.    That said, the rest of OK Computer is almost equally flawless in its complexity and moodiness.  Paranoid Android, Subterranean Homesick Alient, Exit Music, Airbag, and Lucky are all highlights for me, and this is definitely one album where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts--although the parts are great.  The album is very much a journey (corny, I know), and definitely makes a statement.  OK Computer represents one of those rare instances where an artist accomplishes, and in fact exceeds, what it set out to do.      If you don't own this album, buy it.  If you don't own any Radiohead albums, buy this and The Bends.  You won't be sorry.
B000N3ST7K|5.0|One listen and you're hooked.  At least 6 songs that are fantastic that there's no way I would have encountered without QT.  Thanks man, should I expect any less?

B000P2A256|4.0|\\"Drop the needle and pick a hit\\" thats how critics reviewed most of Blue Eyed Soul duo Hall & Oates 80's albums. That same quote would be a good way to sum up Grammy Award Winning Maroon 5's sophomore Album \\"it Won't Be Soon Before Long\\", the Follow-up to the Ten Million Selling \\"Songs About Jane\\".<br /><br />Following in the footsteps of THIS LOVE, MAKES ME WONDER is an upbeat danceable rock/ pop song that features a synthesizer accompanying a heavy bass line. MAKES ME WONDER is sure to be Maroon 5's first ever pop #1 hit and should climb to the top of the Adult top 40 and dance charts as well. MAKES ME WONDER is a song that takes 80's dance/rock elements that remind you of Prince, but also a song that is very modern sounding.<br /><br />Short and catchy, you will be singing MAKES ME WONDER all summer long.<br /><br />But there are alot more \\"potential single choices\\" all over the album. Maroon 5 stick to the 3 minute formula of recording short and catchy songs that are sure to be picked up by radio. There are only 2 songs on the album that clock in over 4 minutes (Good night Good night and Not Falling Apart).<br /><br />The one major differance between this album and Maroon 5's debut album is that Keyboards (digital synthesizers as well as Pianos) can be heard predominantly all over the album. It will be interesting to hear how some of the heavily produced songs will sound live without alot of the pre taped sounds conjured up in the studio to accompany the songs in concert.<br /><br />Besides MAKES ME WONDER, WAKE UP CALL is sure to become a huge hit off this album. The song with its heavy piano bass line accompanying the catchy chorus will have everyone singing and dancing along.<br /><br />If you are looking for a midtempo ballad/ pop song to follow in the footsteps of SHE WILL BE LOVED, NOT FALLING APART or WONT GO HOME WITHOUT YOU would be good single choices.<br /><br />LITTLE OF YOUR TIME could be HARDER TO BREATHE'S cousin with the song's fast paced spoken lyrics, choppy guitar riff's, and a catchy chorus.<br /><br />IF I NEVER SEE YOUR FACE AGAIN & CANT STOP are other songs that are more rock oriented than the first album but also have grooves that give both songs remix potential.<br /><br />Alot of artists worry about the SOPHOMORE JINX, Maroon 5 will not have to worry about that. This album will certainly be a big hit. Hopefully Maroon 5 fans will not have to wait as long for a 3rd album as they had to wait for this second effort.fast paced spoken lyrics, choppy guitar riff's, and a catchy chorus.   <br /> <br />IF I NEVER SEE YOUR FACE AGAIN & CANT STOP are other songs that are more rock oriented than the first album but also have grooves that give both songs remix potential. <br /> <br />Alot of artists worry about the SOPHOMORE JINX, Maroon 5 will not have to worry about that.

B00005YW4H|5.0|I see some reviews calling her Snorah Jones, and others which debate whether what she sings is truly jazz. Who cares! If it tastes good I eat it: if it sounds good I listen to it. This girl possesses a unique and expressive vocal instrument. It sounds good to me, facilitative for relaxing in a comfortable chair with a martini or cabernet after a hard day's work. If I were three or four decades younger, it would be perfect make out music.

B000MRAAJW|5.0|This is an amazing set. The reason i purchased this was to see the landscape in HD, and God it is beautiful. I have HD for the last 8 years and this is the best picture i ever seen. (played on a Mistubishi HD1000U/Toshiba HD-A1 setup). <br /> <br />But as good as the picture is, it's the quality of the documentary that is the best part of this Box-set. Narration is very interesting and you end up seing the world in a very different way, you will realise that humans are not that smart after all. <br /> <br />As for the compatibility issues that some poeple reffer to, you need to update the firmware of ANY hd-dvd player to see this movie, it use newer encoding, wich is more efficient than the oldest one, and it will become the new standard, so you'll have to do it some day anyway. It took 20 minutes on the toshiba hd-a1 over LAN. <br /> <br />I also own the blu-ray version of this series, wich i played on the PS3 with firmware 1.80 to display native 720p over HDMI, the picture quality is identical on both, nobody could tell the difference, exept that the HD-DVD have better menu operations (on-the-fly), but overall, there is no winner <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

Also, the cover was not the same as advertised.  I was expecting the cover shown but instead a different one came.  The other cover shows naked, headless, chopped up barbie dolls laying in whats looks like a thing you are supposed to throw up into.  I was dissapointed with this.
B000000OAC|4.0|News of the World is definitely one of Queen's best albums, featuring TWO of the best known songs in the history of rock, plus plenty of other top-notch songs, although I think the album is slightly sloppy, and has a few low spots. <br /> <br />Obviously, this album has We Will Rock You and We Are the Champions, which defy the very term \\"popular\\". You'd be hard pressed to find a single person in your life who hasn't heard either of these songs, which isn't something you can say about very many songs. They're followed by Roger's rocking Sheer Heart Attack, which is one of the few Roger songs that I fully enjoy (Fight From the Inside is too drawn out and irritating however, one of the lesser songs on the album in my opinion). All Dead, All Dead is possibly the best song on the album, it's a beautiful Brian song with a great melody, definitely a high point. <br /> <br />From the reviews I've read don't seem to agree with me on this point, but I HATE Spread Your Wings. This song made me really sit down and think about John Deacon's lyrical abilities, and I realized that just about every song he's written for Queen is incredibly juvenile and poorly done, and only Freddie's interpretation of the songs allows them to have any value. Spread Your Wings is one of the cheesiest, cliché songs I've ever heard, and I wince every time that \\"powerful\\" chorus comes up. \\"Spread your wings and fly away, fly away, far away, spread your little wings and fly away, fly away, far away\\". Truly poetic, John. <br /> <br />Get Down, Make Love can be a cool song, but the blatant sexuality gets old quickly. The chorus is a good break between the slow verses, and overall it's not a bad song. Sleeping on the Sidewalk is just straight-up blues from Brian, and a good song at that. I always tend to enjoy Brian's songs just as much as Freddie's, he's definitely an under-appreciated singer and songwriter. <br /> <br />Who Needs You is a fun, breezy song with a pleasant feel, and is a case where Freddie saves a song from its own stone-dumb lyrics (it's a John song, to be sure). It's Late has that big anthem, stadium feel, great Queen harmonies fill the chorus, and it's got strong and prominent guitar parts. <br /> <br />My Melancholy Blues is a regular lounge-style song, it's good, but it seems like Freddie hams it up a little too much. It's a nice ending to a varied album, unless you count the remix as the end to the CD, which is NOT a good ending. If you can make it through the whole We Will Rock You remix without trying to choke yourself with your own tongue, then you must not believe in artistic integrity of any type. It says \\"Ruined by Rick Rubin\\", but \\"ruined\\" doesn't begin to describe the horror of this song. I've only listened to it more than once to make sure I wasn't just imagining things, but I won't make that mistake again any time soon. <br /> <br />Overall, News of the World is a great album, though I'll admit that I liked it more on initial listens. Once I started digging deeper into the layers of the songs, they lost a little bit of their appeal, especially once I payed attention to the lyrics of Spread Your Wings. That song, along with Fight From the Inside and occasionally Get Down, Make Love convince me to rate this album at 4 stars instead of 5 (I won't count the remix as Queen's mistake). Apart from those songs though, the rest is very good, and it should easily be appreciated by any Queen fan.

He had just purchased the Monkees' Headquarters, which impressed us as they were evolving and actually playing most of their own instruments. The next Thursday he spotted this new Beatles album in J.C. Penney's and bought it. We immediately forgot all about the Monkees. We looked all over the cover on the way home and once we were there he put it on our parents' record player. Initially, I was a little disoriented. The first thing I heard was crowd noises and then a pulsating song with Paul in scream mode shouting about 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'. I thought, \\"Hey wait a minute. This is the Beatles, not some fictional band\\" but I was swept along for the ride. Not only were the Beatles playing the roles of Sgt. Pepper's band but they introduced another character, Billy Shears, played by Ringo. I had been prepared for the album to a certain extent by the 'Penny Lane/Strawberry Fields' single and I noticed that \\"Little Help from My Friends\\" had that same 'Penny Lane' tempo. What followed was the most bizarre John song I'd heard up to that time. In the beginning his voice is already distorted but then with \\"Cellophane flowers of yellow and green\\" he morphs into something completely different. I follow the journey through a trio of fascinating Paul songs. \\"Getting Better\\"announces its arrival with guitars plucking like the strings of \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" in a jaunty rhythm and an upbeat mood that announces rejuvenation. \\"Fixing a Hole\\" is more pensive and, in its own way, as profound as \\"Within You Without You\\". Then I feel like I've been transported into a Victorian parlor with \\"She's Leaving Home\\". I'm still in that last century visiting a bizarre circus in \\"Benefit of Mr. Kite\\". Flipping to the second side is the most bizarre song I've heard from George as well. The sitar with orchestra creates a cinematic tone and I feel like I'm bobbing on an elephant ride through India. Then it's back to vaudeville with \\"When I'm 64\\" and another bouncy Paul number, \\"Lovely Rita\\", the high energy \\"Good Morning\\" and then back full circle to \\"Sgt. Pepper\\". It's not quite the end though. There's the epic \\"Day in the Life\\", which puts me on another level altogether with the orgasmic orchestral crescendo hitting me full force before I even knew what 'orgasmic' meant. The total package--the amazing, adventurous music, the gaudy cover, the lyrics printed on the back and, for the kid in all of us, the cutouts. My brother and I could think of nothing else for quite a while after that. Everything else paled in comparison, even the other great music that was popping up in various places. Sgt. Pepper became a new baseline, a standard against which all other ambitious music would be judged. It certainly changed my life in a more profound way than the major events of that time. I was already a fanatic but the Beatles reached a new level and pulled me and millions of others onto that level with them. It opened a door that could never be opened again; nor could it be closed. It brought fresh air into life and I, for one, took it all in through one deep breath.
B000J103PC|3.0|This movie was \\"just all right\\". The point of high fashion escapes me, and the lectures in the film were not convincing - at least to me. I watched the movie because Meryl Streep can do no wrong, and this movie was no exception. I was reminded of Glenn Close in 101 Dalmations - not the way I like to see Meryl Streep, but she looked good as an unlikeable character. I far preferred her in \\"Sophie's Choice,\\" but perhaps that's just my taste in movies. I want a movie to say something meaningful, rock my world, make a difference. \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" made me want to go to sleep - and certainly not to work!<br /><br />[[ASIN:0784011710 Sophie's Choice]]
B0002YCVXI|5.0|I never thought Yo-Yo Ma would do Gabriel's Oboe (Track 1) from THE MISSION justice, but I was wrong.  There's a pureness to this version that makes it easier casual listening than the version(s) on the soundtrack CD itself.  So no matter how much I love the theatrical \\"largeness\\" of the Original Soundtrack (not to mention the full choir), this is the version I grab for the CD player/iPod/whatever. <br /> <br />My two other recommendations are Main Theme from ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST (Track 11) and Ecstasy of Gold from THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY (Track 12).  I suggest playing these consecutively as a single medley.  Track 11 *WILL* bring tears to the manliest among us --particularly if you remember in the movie where Sergio Leone pulls the camera up to reveal the town rising.   <br /> <br />I get the feeling \\"hardcore\\" classical fans would dismiss movie scores as commercial work.  I truly believe Ennio Morricone transcends that.  Even moreso than, say, John Williams, and on a different plane than a Danny Elfman.  And I can't say more about the emotion Yo-Yo Ma brings to the table than what's already been discussed.   <br /> <br />
B000OCXMAE|3.0|Musically, this is fabulous. I enjoyed the movements. Thumb up<br /><br />Lyrically, this is such a downer, a scream for help. You successfully got your point across and the lyrics reflect it well. I think many will be able to identify with the problems LP are singing about, but there is no positive message at the end of the day.<br /><br />I pray you find the One who can give you peace.
0393327655|2.0|I am very much an atheist. I believe that much of the world's remediable suffering and ignorance come from religious fanaticism. However, I found Sam Harris's book to be full of fallacious and hateful arguments that would not be out of place in a high school debate tournament.<br /><br />The main problem is that Harris treats pretty much all religions as being the same sort of thing. There is no difference for Harris between the lukewarm spirituality of the Sunday churchgoer, the fanatical ravings of an al Qaeda member, and the mystical ecstasies of Abraham Abulafia. For Harris, all are irrational, and thus evil.<br /><br />A second problem is Harris's rabid hatred for and unwillingness to research the Muslim faith. On pages 117-123, Harris provides a tedious list of verses from the Koran which he hopes will \\"convey the relentlessness with which unbelievers are vilified.\\" The point of this list is to show that all Muslims must certainly find the idea of jihad attractive. Each of these verses is provided on its own, with nothing of the verses which come before and after it, nothing of the commentary on these verses which has been produced by Muslim thinkers, and nothing of the situation which the verse in question is meant to address. One might as well say that Matthew 10:34-36 is an encouragement to Christians to constantly engage in warfare.<br /><br />Another problem is Harris's proposed solution: a one-world government which monitors countries for signs of religious fanaticism. Gee, a world-spanning totalitarian regime dedicated to ensuring ideological purity. I'm sure THAT wouldn't cause any new war, genocide, torture, or irrationality.<br /><br />Another issue is Harris's ridiculous arguments against counterexamples to his position. For example, Stalinism and Maoism were by no means  religious movements, and the largest number of suicidal terrorist attacks comes, not from a Muslim organization, but from the secular \\"Tamil Tigers.\\" Harris disposes of the last-mentioned counterexample in a shoddy footnote which basically says \\"Hey, a lot of those Tamil Tigers are Hindu, and you know how crazy Hindus get.\\" Stalinism and Maoism, on the other hand, are \\"political religion[s]\\" (p. 79). So if genocide weren't involved, would Harris be calling them \\"political secularisms\\"?<br /><br />Overall, this book opens some interesting discussions, but its author's  weak arguments and unwillingness to get his hands dirty with detail work make it hopelessly flawed. Perhaps more disturbingly, this poorly argued screed is ripe for use  as a pretext for anti-Muslim bigotry--exactly the sort of thing which, as we have seen, will NOT lead to a Renaissance of rationality and a decrease of human suffering.oddy footnote which basically says \\"Hey, a lot of those Tamil Tigers are Hindu, and you know how crazy Hindus get.\\" Stalinism and Maoism, on the other hand, are \\"political religion[s]\\" (p. 79).

B000N6TYLW|4.0|Well, Tuesday nights will never be the same. <br />This was a great show and I was a little sad how rushed the ending was.  One little kiss with luke and lor was not enough for fans who waited seven years.  I would have liked to see a wedding, however, everyone talks about a baby also, I didn't really care to see that! <br /> <br />I am glad to see Rory on the way in the world as a reporter, I would have loved some footage of  mother and daughter spending a bit of time together on their summer holiday before Rory rushed off to a last min. job offer.  I am SO glad that she did not get married.  Logan was not right for her and she has a lot of learning and growing to do yet.  As far as someone else said that she \\"couldn't do better\\"...please.  Rory is gorgeous, smart, funny and kind. She will find the perfect person when the time is right. <br /> <br />A great season, I think it just needed about 6 more epis to wrap things up right, how it would have been if the girls had signed on for a shortened season 8....sob! <br />Cheers from Canada!
B000002UUX|5.0|And so it arrives, the crowning achievement of the Megadeth catalogue, one of the contenders for album of the decade and really this is start of the art metal for 1990 and still sounds cutting edge at the time of writing. Produced by Mike Clink and Mustaine with mixing by Max Norman this is an album that can be listened to from beginning to end, there are just no dud tracks at all.<br /><br />Holy Wars...the Punishment Due kicks off proceedings with one of the finest slices of metal you'll hear anywhere. It moves through a number of sections and guitar attacks finally descending into a maelstrom of metallic fury. And a pretty cool video for it didn't hurt sales figures one little bit.<br /><br />Hanger 18's video was not so widely loved but was indicative of the sort of budget Megadeth now commanded. As for the song itself it consists of Mustaine and Friedman trading licks in a synchromeshed six string symphony, - awesome stuff. The trend continues with Take No Prisoners in that it's an excellent tune but, again, different to Holy Wars just as Hanger 18 had a different feel to it. And ultimately that is one of the main reasons this is such an excellent album, ie the tunes are different but each one is great metal. Five Magics is a simple rivethead workout, Poison was the Cure is a denser listening experience whereas Lucretia and Tornado of Souls hit the nail on the head with typical Mustaine lyrical and musical aggression.<br /><br />Things are slowed down considerably for Dawn Patrol which is almost totally dependant on a steady bass line and it's unsurprising this was one of the tunes co-written by Ellefson. The tune has a stripped back feel utterly different to the rest of the album and a thoroughly different pace. It essentially is a vision of a post apocolyptic world as envisaged by team Megadeth.<br /><br />Rounding out the album is Rust in Peace... Polaris. A tune where some of the lyrics don't seem to flow too well and the aggression seems somewhat forced providing for a jarring effect on the listener increased by the fact that the drumming is also riding a stop/start rhythm. After the bare bones Dawn Patrol it provides a different metal experience to finish the album.<br /><br />All up this entire album is pretty much the definitive Megadeth statement only challenged by Countdown to Extinction for supremacy in the bands catalogue. An album that showed the band had outgrown thrash and segued into pure metal built on the foundations of solid chops and a will to conquer. The ensure tour levelled cities.orced providing for a jarring effect on the listener increased by the fact that the drumming is also riding a stop/start rhythm.

0767802519|4.0|Here is the rare film that combines a ridiculous storyline with a fabulous cast, great overacting, action, tenderness, angst and pathos and creates a winner you can't take your eyes, ears, heart or attention from. It will have you rooting for a serial killer who is teaching a 12-year-old the tricks of the trade. No kidding!<br /><br />Jean Reno, who has probably never given a poor performance, is perfectly cast as an illiterate killer for hire. When Natalie Portman's family -- which lives in his building -- is murdered by bad cop-cocaine dealer Gary Oldman and crew, not yet teenager Portman survives and takes up housekeeping with the illiterate neighbor, a witness to the murders that is a full-time contractor to restaranteur Danny Aiello, playing the kind of gritty New York role that's made him famous.<br /><br />You've probably already figured out this movie contains a lot of profanity, killing, bloodletting, foul play, and good guy-bad guy technique that's typical in this kind of urban drug-induced \\"police\\" drama. What you haven't figured out -- and what you won't until you see this film -- is the affectionate relationship it creates between older than her years but still youthful Portman and her new father figure and the way this relationship will addict you to this film.<br /><br />Their relationship is about as connective as that torch you still carry for the high school sweetheart that got away. It sits beneath the surface eating up emotional bandwidth and retaining a place in your shattered psyche. The relationship between Portman and Reno (pronounced renn-Oh, not like the city in Nevada) will do the same thing to you.<br /><br />I had no idea this movie, now 13 years of age, had all this going for it. It's a film that catches you unprepared. You want to see all the killing and be neutralized by its brutality. Yet this tender relationship between two down and out figures draws you in like a wet kitten at your front door whose mother was just run over by a car in the street. It melts your heart. Meanwhile, Gary Oldman is the [erfect foil, the epitome of evil. He gets his later in a memorable scene with our hero, Reno.<br /><br />You have all this to look forward to as many times as you want by buying, renting, or borrowing this wonderful movie. My advice is to get on with it.by a car in the street. It melts your heart. Meanwhile, Gary Oldman is the [erfect foil, the epitome of evil.

1582405956|4.0|This book just have one problem... When you see the picture from the cover,  you will wait for this beautiful color inside. But the fact is... just Black and White inside.
0783229372|1.0|The movie itself rates maybe 3 stars; but I could barely watch it because the video quality was horrible.  Universal should be ashamed at the graininess of the picture.  I was so upset that I had been \\"taken\\" that I had trouble concentrating on the story.  Furthermore, the explosion of the vessel at the end of the movie was filmed in black and white.  I understand why -- it allowed for the interspersement of actual historical footage into the movie -- but it took away from what would have been a spectacular visual effect in color.  Of course, the video quality was so bad that maybe it would not have mattered.  I'm really angry that I bought this clunker.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|It is a remarkable view of our world.  My grade-school kid loves to watch it...but after an hour it is too much nature for too long.  Because of the wide variety of animals and scenery, these movies hold kids' attention much more than \\"March of the Penguins\\", which is a fine documentary in its own right. <br />

0066620996|5.0|For years, building a great company has been considered as a fuzzy art, which not many can master, not even learn. In Good to Great, Jim Collins has shed the light of empirical evidence into the area especially reserved for superhuman CEO and larger-than-life myths. Unlike many other books, all conclusions in Good to Great are derived from pure statistical facts. The book carries not only numbers and digits behind great success but also a strong encouraging voice defying mediocrity. Good to Great is well written and applicable to everyone. For those who strive to perfection, reading this is definitely a must. Yet, even for those who reckon greatness as a distant luxury, Good to Great is a harmless trial. If it cannot shake one out of apathy, it will at least bring attention to that very hidden corner of capability.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|I liked the movie. The story was a story about how things will always work out no matter what. On the other hand the movie just told the story like it was without any dramatic effect. Also as soon as things turned around for Chris the movie abruptly ended without telling how success pays off like they talked about on 60 minutes. Overall it was a good movie and I'm glad I got the DVD.
B000MRAAJW|3.0|I know that I will be in the extreme minority here based on what I'm about to say but here it goes. <br /> <br />I watched this series on Discovery HD and purchased the HD-DVD set shortly after it was released.  I read many reviews and forum posts about this set especially on Sigorny Weaver's narration.  (Most couldn't stand her narration and were applauding the Attenborough narration on the new sets). <br /> <br />While I don't dislike David Attenborough's narration, I really prefer Weaver's.  (I can't believe I said that!)  Attenborough does sound older, (naturally) and I have to turn the volume up to hear him as well, I just feel Weaver's narration is more \\"effortless\\" to listen to and understand.  This is not because of Attenborough's accent. <br /> <br />My remaining gripes about this set are in the Audio/Video quality, lack of features and the addition of the Weaver narration track if possible.  Although someone in the forum did give good reasons as to why that probably did not happen due to the editing for American TV. <br /> <br />I know everyone loves the quality of the picture on this set and it is HD, but I have had HD for a few years, and am used to looking at it.  I am very critical of picture quality and am disappointed...  There is a lot of noise in many of the scenes for HD quality.  I have 2 HD Televisions and basically the top of the line 1080p HD player as of this writing. (Toshiba XA-2) <br />I have hooked it up on HDMI and component, 1080p and 1080i, and the noise is there in many of the scenes.  Some scenes are jaw dropping with almost no noise whatsoever, 3D-ish with incredible \\"POP\\" and many are just downright disappointing and I'm not only talking about dark scenes which digital cameras will naturally show noise.  I feel that although this set was filmed mostly in HD, I'm sure they could have spent more time in the editing room cleaning up the picture in many scenes.  I am going to say that this version at 1080p didn't really look better than the broadcast in HD.  Although the broadcast is at lower resolution, 720p or 1080i, it did not look as noisy as the HD-DVD set.  This may be because at higher resolution, imperfections are amplified and easier to see.  Sitting 10-15+ feet away, many people will not even notice. <br /> <br />The audio quality of this set is not very good for an HD production.  It could have been much better and would have added even more to the viewing experience of the series. <br /> <br />I know many will disagree with my opinion here, but they could have spent more time and care on this HD set.  Just putting it on Blu-Ray or HD-DVD is not enough.  They spent an ungodly amount making this thing over 5 years, spend and extra 2-3 months cleaning it up and make it look even better before you release it.  I'm sure they were rushing to get this set commercial as soon as the initial airing was completed on Discovery Channel.  It is possible to realease a 1080p disc with poor video quality.  While I won't say the video quality is poor, I was expecting better and more consistant video quality. <br /> <br />I have come across other posts and reviews complaining of noise and grain in the picture.  I am hoping to find someone I know with the Blu-Ray version to see if it's exactly like this one. <br /> <br />I doubt my review will deter anyone from purchasing this set.  (It's not intended too.)  It's more of a heads up and know what to expect.  Don't pay the $99.99 retail like many stores have it for.
B0002NRRAG|4.0|I love the music of Madeleine Peyroux.  She certainly has her own style and anyone who enjoys jazz will feel fortunate to enjoy any of her music. I found this CD to be tops in every way.
B000LC55F2|4.0|The Prestige is a tale of professional rivalry gone haywire.  Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman star as two magicians pathologically obsessed with each other.  I don't know anything about magic, and I found the premise of the film innovative.  You get a glimpse into the world of professional magic, and showmanship, as Bale and Jackman try for years to outdo each other's careers due to a personal vendetta.  Michael Kane is their mentor and does a great supporting role - as always.  Like a good magic show, the film keeps the viewer constantly guessing, and slightly in the dark about what is really going on.  The film will hold your interest, especially when it takes a turn towards science fiction with the introduction of the physicist Tessla, who is asked to use science to create a new, and real, magic trick.  The outcome of physics meeting magic is surprising, and the final \\"prestige\\" - the secret revealed- of the film left me truly surprised.  The romantic role of Bale's wife takes an overly melodramatic turn, but if you can overlook that flaw, and the overwhelming need for the films two characters to just \\"let go\\", the film rewards with a most unusual mystery.
0800177177|5.0|Purists might hate this version of Dracula for the liberties it takes but I loved it. Gary Oldman's performance as Dracula was simply amazing...he brings romance to the role, a dark knight who is depicted more as a victim of fate than a true evil creature, and his love for Mina [whom he feels is the reincarnation of his long-dead wife] is altogether real and credible. Anthony Hopkins brings a certain level of zealousness to the role of Van Helsing, but I can't say Iwas very impressed by Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder's performances. Firstly there was no chemistry between them though they were supposed to be engaged, and similarly Winona's Mina seemed like a cold fish to me, especially in her love scenes with the Count [the actress who played Lucy on the other hand was pretty scintillating].But despite some of the flawed performances, the movie on the whole was beautifully filmed. The cinematography was lush and evoked decadent images, especially the seduction scenes, in particular Keanu's seduction by the three wives of Dracula, and also Lucy's seduction and attack by Dracula. The costumes are sumptuous to look at. The use of the color red throughout the movie [Lucy's dress, the scene where Dracula stalks Mina] is vivid and reminds us of the lust for blood. The score is haunting and serves to keep viewers' at the edge of their seats as the story unfolds. Overall, this is one of the best contemporary adaptations of Dracula, and a classic.
B000MV9026|5.0|Great movie for our kids. they loved it watch it at least twice a week
B000O178BY|5.0|It should be impossible for Year Zero to be as good as it is. The painstakingly orchestrated viral marketing campaign surrounding the album - hidden messages on t-shirts leading to a series of cryptic websites, telephone numbers leading to ominous recorded messages, and secret shows being shut down via staged SWAT raids - should have automatically made the album a disappointment; it was just too much hype for one album to live up to. <br /> <br />Surprisingly (or unsurprisingly), in typical Reznor fashion, expectations are both defied and exceeded with Year Zero. Heavily electronic (even by NIN standards), the album employs a virtual pallette of electronic noises in tandem with a sparse amount of organic instruments. The result is a noisy, abrasive, and yet compelling 63 minutes of avant-garde syth rock, as ahead of its time today as The Downward Spiral was in 1994. <br /> <br />Despite its corrosive sound and unconventional song structures (a Reznor trademark), Year Zero is an incredibly enjoyable listen. Beneath its layers of electronic noise is a constant undercurrent of melody that, while subtle, is sufficient to add a spark of vitality to the steril soundscapes of iMac generated blips and bloops. Case in point: there's not a song on Year Zero you can't bob your head to. <br /> <br />The electro-jazz of 'The Good Soldier' is NIN at its smoothest and most laid back, while 'Meet Your Master' is vintage electronic rock, layering rumbling basslines over sound effects and synths straight out of an 80s video arcade. The album even takes a turn toward unsettling and eery with the creepy atmospherics of 'The Greater Good' in which Reznor repeatedly whsipers \\"Breathe us in slowly\\" over dischordant piano keys and and a rythmic drum loop. And while the years have considerably deepend Reznor's voice, he finds interesting and effective ways to use it, complimenting or contrasting his music while never once letting it sound forced or contrived. <br /> <br />After 17 years asNine Inch Nails, Reznor is still at the very top of his game, constructing some of the most challenging, relevant, and thought-provoking music around. Year Zero stands as proof that there's still room left for creativity and ingenuity in a time when music is regarded and a commodity.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|I've enjoyed this disc since it came out and am still listening to it today in preparation for the upcoming tour. Jim Steinman and Desmond Child show that they have the songwriting chops that give Meat Loaf his voice.  <br />This newest installment of the \\"Bat\\" trilogy has all the drama and charismatic hooks as he's ever had yet feels like a rock musical and really like the last act of a musical epic. Performances by Steve Vai, Brian May, Tommy Lee and a host of other top talent give the songs bombastic weight.  <br />The mix of songs that predated the newest material blend well and the production is crisp and top notch. I was a kid when the 70's \\"Bat 1\\" came out, a rock fan for the 80's \\"Bat 2\\" but now a full fledged junkie about this disc, \\"Bat 3\\". It has that perfectly aged musical rock opera quality to it, great for the Millenium Meat Loaf. <br /> <br /> They few critics I've heard and read from don't seem to ever get the point about the intention of this music, to be over the top rock opera so their criticisms seem to also apply to all Meat Loaf's music. Point is: if you enjoyed the previous \\"Bat Out Of Hell\\" chapters, this one should rock your socks off!
B00000JG41|5.0|what a dumbass. the chanting has been around much longer than that.  mike just borrowed the idea and incorporated it into an amazing song.... kind of like the new tomahawk album... native american songs were around long long ago... but patton took the ideas and made them into a metal/alternative/electronic album. there's a difference between copying something, and being influenced by something and creating your own genius music with those influences. you're probably too dumb to realize that though if you had to post a review just to say something so incredibly dumb and ignorant.  <br /> <br />ps-california is a good album :)
B000OCXMAE|3.0|First off, it's my opinion that Linkin Park did the right thing by trying to go into a new direction.  I certainly did not want to hear another safe, 3-minute-per-song, radio-friendly album again (but that's not to knock \\"Hybrid Theory\\" or \\"Meteora\\").  Going into a new direction was the right thing to do; it was just executed wrong. Perhaps part of the problem is that there has been too much of a gap (4 years) between the last album and this album.  Therefore there was no real transition to at least help bridge the gap just a little bit.  However, respect must be given to the band for having the courage to break away from playing it safe, which I believe they have been doing their entire career until now.  \\"Meteora\\" was a carbon copy of \\"Hybrid Theory\\" (and just as short). \\"Reanimation\\" was in-between these albums and was unnecessary.  And then to do that album with Jay-Z to appeal to the hip-hop crowd, well...there's no reason to rape your own songs like that.<br /><br />I also don't believe it's a good thing when there are explanations to each song in the album booklet, because I think the work should speak for itself.  And speak for themselves the songs certainly do.  As has been mentioned, the songs are strong up until around track 8, where it is quite obvious that the songs sound like discarded B-sides.  As it turns out, they more or less actually are; that is that they were picked over other recorded songs which had more production.  I'm aware that the artists themselves usually see their work in a different light than the fans do.  Perhaps that is why they chose to put these weak, experimental tracks on the final cut of the album.  But, unfortunately it just doesn't work.  The lack of Mike Shinoda's rapping also cannot be overlooked here, but I don't think that's such a bad thing.  His rapping worked incredibly well on some past songs like \\"Papercut\\" and \\"In the End,\\" but it used to be on nearly every single track the band has done, which was too much.  With that said, here's a brief analysis of each song...<br /><br />The first track, \\"Wake,\\" is a complete waste of a track.  From there we are led straight to \\"Given Up,\\" which rocks and rocks hard. My personal favorite on the album is next, \\"Leave Out All the Rest,\\" which is your obligatory, radio-friendly ballad (but I like rock ballads so it's fine with me).  I didn't care much for \\"Bleed It Out\\" at first, but it grew on me after a few listens, and as the band says, it's most evident on this track that the band had fun recording this album.  Next, we have \\"Shadow Of the Day,\\" which is a good song, but not a great song.  It sounds exactly like U2's \\"With Or Without You\\" in terms of the pacing and musical cues.  The first single, \\"What I've Done,\\" I was personally tired of by the time I picked up this album, but is overall a pretty good song.  \\"Hands Held High\\" is arguably the most controversial song on this album, and I do have to say that it's completely overrated.  There's talk of this song containing the best two verses of Mike Shinoda's career.  Give me a break.  Anybody can complain or point out the problems in the world.  Believe me, we know all about it.  The \\"Amen\\" chorus is absolutely terrible as well, and I believe that this song may have been saved with an actual good chorus.  \\"No More Sorrow\\" continues the political rant; again, pointing out the obvious and speaking directly to President Bush, but offering no suggestions on how to fix world issues.  It's also very reminiscent of Metallica's \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls,\\" which is a good thing.<br /><br />After the above tracks, the album begins to fall short.  \\"Valentine's Day\\" is a mellow song, albeit not terrible, as it reminds me very much of an older song the band has done, \\"My December.\\"  However, it still left me wanting more.  Next, we have \\"In Between.\\" Oh, boy.  Just what the hell is this crap?  Easily the worst song on the album, Mike Shinoda actually sings, which is not a good thing.  Please, leave the singing to Chester; it's what he's there for!  It's obvious to me that this song was picked to make the cut to try something the band hasn't done yet.  But it doesn't work.  \\"In Pieces\\" is probably the equivalent to \\"Meteora's\\" \\"Breaking the Habit,\\" with the same almost danceable melodic tone.  Once again, I was left wanting more, and this song just isn't as good.  And finally, we have \\"The Little Things Give You Away,\\" which at least strays away from the 3-minute verse-chorus-verse-chrous formula that dominated most of the band's first two albums.  For that reason I respect this track, and quite frankly was hoping the band's songs would evolve into this style, only harder.  Most of this track is slow and weak, and ends with a decent guitar melody.  But it's definitely a track that belongs pushed way toward the end of an album.<br /><br />Perhaps a contributing factor to the band's major change was the musical freedom they found in doing their side projects.  Spending 4 years experimenting can probably only make you get sick of doing the same old thing and care less about playing it safe.  But Metallica shared a similar fate, and eventually lost touch with what their fans love best about them by the time they made \\"St. Anger,\\" which failed miserably on many levels.  Linkin Park seems to be following in the same footsteps (perhaps because of Rick Rubin's influence).  The minute bands start making the music *they* want to make, the less fans are likely to like it.<br /><br />All in all, this album shows a wide range of diversity, and will take many listens for the latter tracks to grow on the average fan., leave the singing to Chester; it's what he's there for!

B000NVIGC0|4.0|If there's one thing I can depend on with Wilco, it's that the band always knows how to make a record in which there you can count on one, maybe two songs that can be ignored.  To me, that's the sign of an awesome band.  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was definitely that way, especially with the painfully frustrating song `I'm the Man Who Loves You'. `Summerteeth' is just a brilliant, great piece of rock `n' roll, though `Pieholden Suite' didn't do much for me.   And `A Ghost is Born', without the minutes upon minutes of drone in `Less Than You Think' is sheer perfection.  I guess that is what I have resorted to with Wilco, pointing out my own minute criticisms with one of the most innovative bands around.  Otherwise, it would take too long to deliver praise. It's really no different with `Sky Blue Sky', as once again there are maybe two songs that I can skip (like `On and On and On', for instance).   <br /> <br />This album seems like a turning point in the band's tenure. Jeff Tweedy appears a little older, more mature, and the introspection definitely comes through.  Nels Cline is brilliant at guitar (as usual), though I fear his skills are slightly underused (this is probably not the album on which to unleash them).  The songwriting is solid and the whole album comes off as very polished.  For me, it's hard to top AGIB, but this doesn't try to.  Overall, it's a period piece, focusing on the present, the self-realization that despite life's hardships, all is not lost as long as that blue rests above your head.  Good album. <br />
B000NA1OXY|2.0|I agree with many others, and have trouble taking this album seriously...especially after her great freshman and sophmore efforts.
B000002BBY|5.0|Oasis is a superb band, and while they did enjoy moderate success in the United States with \\"Wonderwall\\" and a few other tunes, their popularity in the UK is immensely greater (in fact, this album itself is the number two selling album of all time in the UK, second only to The Beatles). And it is truly unfortunate that they never reached this level of success in America. Oasis could have been much more, and if time hadn't been wasted brawling and drinking, I believe these Brits could have even surpassed Nirvana in popularity in the States. A bold statement, I know, but just give this immaculate album a listen. (What's The Story) Morning Glory? is definitely one of the best albums of the nineties and possibly one of the best of all time.<br /><br />It is apparent that the lads of Oasis have put alot into every track. There is not one weak song on the album. Albeit it really isn't the most original stuff out there (the songs of The Beatles, T. Rex, etc. all come to mind when listening), but it is by far some of the most satisfying and enjoyable Britpop out there. The UK has always been a haven for excellent rock bands...Pink Floyd, Led Zep, The Who, The Clash...and with this album, Oasis can now be listed among those. Leading the wave of British rockers in the 90's, now looking back it is apparent that these guys were a blessing, the complete opposite of the grunge and lame pop dominating the airwaves in those days.<br /><br />On to the songs themselves, \\"Wonderwall\\", \\"Don't Look Back In Anger\\", \\"Cast No Shadow\\", and \\"Champagne Supernova\\" are all instantly recognizable as some of the most popular hits found on here. However, throughout there are many more gems. \\"Hello\\", which leads us off, is by far one of the rougher songs on this overall softer (for Oasis, at least) CD, more reminiscent of Definitely Maybe, and is a great way to lead things off. In the same vein as \\"Hello\\" lies \\"Morning Glory\\", a fantastic song with an incredibly catchy guitar riff. One of the most underrated songs on here, with clever lyrics and a unique rhythm is \\"She's Electric\\". Everything on here deserves a listen, as everything is just as good as the next.<br /><br />Overall, a must-have for those who wish to return to the good old days of rock and roll. This album is certainly a piece of the progression of Oasis, but musically it harks back to the days when an the entire album was true music, no filler included. A superb CD.ost underrated songs on here, with clever lyrics and a unique rhythm is \\"She's Electric\\".

B000HEWEDK|4.0|Forbidden Planet was the blueprint for Star Trek, Lost in Space, Star Wars, It was so influential that you may watch it, and see a whole new genre that popped up because of it. The movie is the first time the world saw the Robbie Robot character, the same robot give or take a few spare parts from Lost in Space. The crew of the space ship was a complete crew even down to a cook. Laser shooters were used in this movie as well, a Hollywood first. That being said it did have some flaws; the characters were all one dimensional. The story went no where at times. Such as the time where the cook got the robot to synthesize bourbon. Yes some of the plot just seemed like filler. I really got the feeling that Dr. Morbius was based on Captain Nemo from 20000 leagues Jules Verne story. The way how he gave the tour of his world and machinery just seemed so familiar to the 20000 leagues story. Overall this is a fine transfer to DVD, and has quite extras on this DVD package. If you love old science fiction campy films this is a must have.
B00005V9IJ|4.0|Tom Hanks has to carry this film pretty much on his own and he does an admirable job. A FedEx employee used to an insanely, fast-paced life, he has to adjust to the danger and abject isolation of life alone on a desert island when his plane goes down in bad weather (an excellent sequence). Meanwhile his family have given him up for dead and moved on with their lives.<br /><br />\\"Cast Away\\" turns many of the romantic notions - of being stranded on a desert island and then being rescued and reunited with his family - on their head.<br /><br />It is ultimately a sad film that offers no easy resolution.<br /><br />The film-makers should be commended for making such an off-beat and thoughtful film.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Supernatural Season 2 did what most shows fail to do in their sophmore year and that's deliver.  The first season was amazing and when shows are amazing the second season is put under a lot of pressure.  The show surpassed the first season with such ease.  Eric Kripke and company filled the season with funny episodes, scary episodes and heart wrenching episodes.  This season was also filled with outstanding guest actors.  And the lead actors showed just why they got the job.  Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki's acting was darn near perfect.  They each had their episodes where they shined but the season belonged to Ackles.  He showed why he's a former 3 time Emmy nominee especially in the gut-gripping, edge of your seat 2 part season finale.  In \\"All Hell Breaks Loose Part 2\\" the season ended with so much promise for season 3. No one is left disappointed just itching for more.
B00005JPGO|3.0|\\"Blood Diamond\\" highlights an important issue - diamonds being used to fund civil wars in this case the civil war in Sierra Leone in the late 1990's.<br /><br />The viewer is introduced to these issues via three characters - a South African diamond smuggler played by Leonardo di Caprio, an American journalist played by Jennifer Connelly, and a local whose family is torn apart.<br /><br />Sadly Leonardo is miscast in the \\"he-man\\" role - he's just too nice - although his attempt at a South African accent is pretty good. Connelly is also somewhat lightweight as the journalist although she it not helped by dialogue that largely leaves her spouting polemics. The villians are merely cardboard cutouts.<br /><br />The plot is all-too-contrived and cliched and builds to a predictable conclusion.<br /><br />The film-makers are to be commended for bringing an important issue to a mainstream film, however, they are all-too-obvious in making their point leaving the viewer feeling preached to rather than moved.
B000F6IOC0|2.0|If you like vampire and/or werewolf films, and aren't concerned about them making sense, you'll love this one. I say that because this, like its predecessor, took a cool concept and instead of fully exploring it made a Monster Movie meets The Wild West. <br /> <br />My main complaint (I have many more) is that there are two races, two races that are as interwoven into Western mythical culture as any - vampires and werewolves - and these two races evoke enormous emotion in any who follow them, fan and critic alike. They have boundless strengths and powers. They're even *mated* in this film, a sum that is greater than its parts (granted they're not very well defined). Am I to understand that the very best these guys could do in a Vampire vs. Werewolf film where they've *mated* is to include extremely (over)long shots of action that are staccatoed by automatic handguns and rifles? That when advanced weaponry is introduced (UV bullets, and bullets that contain silver oxide?!), that the best we get are regular bullets? If I'm Selene (Beckinsale), I'm loading up on BOTH of these bullets, not just the useless lead ones. <br /> <br />We're introduced to a much deeper mythology than we were introduced to in the first film. That's a wonderful thing - except they don't go anywhere with it other than to its inevitable conclusion. And in the end, it fails. After a very long battle between the good guys and the bad guys, with more bullets than magic or fists and claws and fangs, there is a resolution. It's a resolution that, when you examine the sum of its parts, doesn't add up. The mythology that I referred to earlier doesn't add up, or hold up, either. <br /> <br />I can say this: everything that went into making the film LOOK good paid off. It was gorgeous. Unfortunately, this was only skin deep - and when the sun rose at the end of the film, one had to wonder how deeply it would itch. <br /> <br />
B000OCXF0Q|2.0|I got this expecting her usual style of music, a little dark and a little pop rock and somehow it became \\"bubble gum pop rock\\".  I really liked her style from her previous two albums, but now it took a really odd turn.  Sounds like it was aimed at a teen demographic only.
B000FP2OPY|4.0|The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5, is because some of the episodes are so dark that its hard to see on a smaller TV. I've been avidly following the show since it premiered, and was more than happy with the DVD release. It seems like a lot of shows lately have been skimping on the extras, but there were some really good ones on this set.
B00005YU1O|4.0|This movie can be a barrage for the senses and can make you doubt what you might think is reality.  I was moved greatly by this movie and I have loved ith from the first time that I saw it.  Some of the theories in it may seem so far out there because you have never really thought about them that way before, but once they are presented to you they kinda make sense.  If you like to think outside of the box then give this movie a shot and you won't be disappointed.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|Have the DVD, bought the \\"soundtrack\\" for \\"Horse To Water\\" and guess what? IT'S NOT ON IT!!! What kind of \\"soundtrack\\" would eliminate, what to me, was one of the highlights of the concert (not to mention, \\"I'll See You In My Dreams\\"!) VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! This has ruined what would have been a \\"Classic CD\\" to me. Should have named this CD, \\"SELECTIONS from the CONCERT FOR GEORGE\\"... STILL 5 stars!
1599869470|5.0|Well I am into my third week with this book. It can not be read like a normal book since each chapter represents a lesson.So far I am having fun with the book. The exercises are very helpful  and I am learning all about how much we need to be able to control our thoughts. I am learning things about my self I never new. I think it is a great book and could  be of great help to those who want to have a more focus mind. God knows this is something we can all do with.
B000FGGE68|1.0|Admit it.  Milla Jovovich with purple hair is hot.  You're right, she is.  Well, you're not alone because that seemed to be the only idea behind this production.  Other than that, Ultraviolet is cold, stiff, shiny, cheap-looking, badly shot, and woodenly acted.<br /><br />Rent if you must!
B000O174CM|4.0|The performances in DreamGirls are all they were built up to be. Even though I've heard Jennifer Hudson sing \\"And I am Telling You I'm not Going\\" perhaps 50 times or more, when it came to the song in the story, it was very moving. The music and costumes are terrific. This DVD is definitely collector's material. <br /> <br />Even though we've all heard this is not based on Barry Gordy and the Supremes, it sure makes you wonder....
B00000260F|1.0|PU Jeff, If funk was where you wanted to be when you made this album you should have called Bootsy up and set a date. I've listened to Beck since '75,bought every thing I could find he plays on including this farce and seen him live many times but nothing can save this one. Stinko lyrics, cornball sound. Of course if your a fan of COMMERCIAL 80's pop/funk <br />aka madonna you probably would like this . And if you don't believe me check out how many copies of this CD are availabe used for 5 bucks, somebody knows something. If I could strip the guitar parts out and set it to different music I would because,yes I love HIS playing but man it's rough listening to the nonsense around it.
0385340559|3.0|Someone is killing Jack Reacher's old team.  This is a special investigative unit he formed when he was one of the army's top military policemen.  The squad was composed of the best of the best and strong bonds of fellowship, duty and affection bound them together.  When Reacher receives a coded message that trouble is afoot, he kicks into gear and with the remnants of the team, sets out to even the score. Not the best of Lee Child's \\"Reacher\\" series--while the team members brought a different dynamic to the series, I prefer when Reacher's the long wolf, exacting a solitary and brutal form of frontier justice. Child's research is impressive and his cinematic eye allows him to paint scenes vividly with few unnecessary details. A perfect summer read, engaging, vivid and compelling.
B0000C9JCM|5.0|I sort of think of myself as a Viginia Hillbillie... educated however.  I am not into classical music either.  There is, however, something about Pachelbel's Canon that does something miraculous to my mind. The music is beautiful...  very very beautiful.  I put the CD in my car, roll the windows up and turn up the sound and listen to it end-to-end over and over again.  It is so soothing... causing a rush of seratonin in your brain making the world seeming all part of your euphoria. <br /> <br />Even if you aren't into classical... buy this one and you will impress your friends with your new found sophistication... and you won't have to fake it either!!!
B000QUCNP4|5.0|After having become jaded over the years of watching thriller/horror movies. I was surprised but in a good way to feel how petrified with fear Ione Skye as Kathleen Johns was in her maybe 5 minute part within the movie. Her performance was brief but extraordinarily potent.    I went into The City to see it with a friend who grew up there within San Francisco itself during The Zodiac's spree. It was very eerie to see the actual sites within the movie that were really filmed there in SF. No backlot in LA with computer effects to enhance the SF scenery.    Davind Fincher himself grew up in the San Rafael area during the time of Zodiac. As he remembers having the CHP follow his school bus along its route for safety.     Brian Cox ate up his role as the colorful Melvin Belli. I never get tired of watching Robert Downey Jr. Everyone did an excellent job in getting the look and styles of the various decades just right.    This movie shows what can happen to people bent on obsession. Both in positive and negative directions. What the cost is in terms of time or to one's family and to the payoff when it ends. A brilliant and excellent film!    I can't wait for the dvd release. Hopefully with Fincher commentary, deleted scenes, and marketing stuff.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|An excellent movie/book that should convince even the doubters.  I really enjoyed it.
1591396190|4.0|Blue Ocean Strategy is described as the creation of new markets; where market space is uncontested; where the competition becomes irrelevant; and where the tendency to engage in value-cost trade-off is broken.   It was written by W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne. <br />The book takes the reader through a descriptive analysis of the Blue Ocean Strategy.  However, I feel it fails to make a convincing case for maintaining a competitive advantage in the long run, even though it attempts to do so in its conclusion \\"The sustainability and Renewal of Blue Ocean Strategy\\".    For example, it defends the Blue Ocean Strategy by demonstrating how CNN and its 24 hour news business model, was ridiculed by the major networks as an unsustainable business model.  The authors point out that \\"ridicule does not inspire rapid imitation\\".  Perhaps they are right, but for how long?  A few years later we now have MSNB, CNBC and the new ratings king, for now anyway, Fox News.   You could make a point that Fox News actually benefited from NOT being the Blue Ocean innovator. <br />Also, the risks of the Blue Ocean Strategy are not discussed extensively.   There is something to be said about joining a crowded market (red ocean) and competing by improving the value proposition minimally.   Most business people dream of creating this elusive \\"Blue Ocean\\" where there is no competition, however, I would venture to speculate that for every successful blue ocean strategy there are hundreds of failures that could have had a better result had they decided to compete in an established market.  <br />We all admire the Blue Ocean creators for their vision and value to the marketplace and this book describes some of the advantages of creating such an enterprise quite well.  The authors do get you thinking creatively and they do a fabulous job analyzing their Blue Ocean companies and how they broke from the status quo by their focus on value innovation. <br />Blue Ocean has made it into the vernacular of the business world.  I am surprised how often I have heard and used this term to describe the creation of a new market. <br />Enjoy! <br />
0066620996|5.0|Good to Great is an extensive research project condensed in an easy to read book.  This book is different from your average leadership book in that it doesn't use fad strategies but instead uses a few sound leadership ideas.  Collins found these ideas by searching for companies that made considerable long term gains compared to their competition and discovered what these great companies had in common.   A few of these ideas seem common sense but few business leaders follow these ideas.  This book might not be appear useful for someone who isn't high up in the executive food chain but this book might help you get their.  He uses a few cute metaphors such as Hedge Hog Concept and Rinsing the Cottage Cheese that might turn off some readers.
B000N3SS80|5.0|To be honest with you, I did not like her English songs. She sings better in Spanish.  I was impressed to hear that all her songs on the CD \\"Como Ama Una Mujer\\" were all knock-outs. I heard her husband Marc Anthony, in the back ground. I know his voice anywhere, and it sounded terrific. She can go a long way if she continue singing her songs in Spanish, even if she mixes a little bi-lingual It would be even better. I love them both and God has bless them together.  And this CD I feel that it was the root of there love for each other and a new beginning. No words can express how I feel about them and their songs.
B000P2A256|3.0|Maroon 5 (Adam Levine, James Valentine, Jesse Carmichael, Mickey Madden, Matt Flynn)  return with their sophomore studio album \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\" (2007).  The Los Angeles group propelled themselves to stardom with their groundbreaking studio debut \\"[[ASIN:B00006879E Songs About Jane]]\\" (2002). I was not surprised to see their cd being sold at Starbuck's. People reading this review should know I generally listen to different music genres. The first single \\"Makes Me Wonder\\" is an upbeat catchy tune which has blown up on the radio.  My personal favorite Maroon 5 track is \\"She Will Be Loved\\" - this album does not have anything that can compare with the track. Attempts are made in decent track's like \\"Won't Go Home Without You\\" and \\"Nothing Lasts Forever\\" (which uses the same Adam Levine chorus from his collaboration with Kayne West on \\"Heard Em Say\\"). I agree with reviewer A.D.D. who stated \\"The new disc is washed, scrubbed and polished to the point where you just want to hear some raw emotion out of Levine's voice but you never do\\". This album has been crafted to sell, and has a lot of material which will appeal to mainstream audiences. I can see how some people would find it unfair to compare this album to the last instead stating that is the way musical progression goes. I personally prefer a more low key Maroon 5, without all the glitz and fine tuning - less Hollywood, more heart. Overall \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\" is a decent release worth checking out.
B000M4RG4C|1.0|I love Eastwood movies. Especially Million Dollar Baby abd Mystic River. Before buying the<br /><br />DVD I was sure this would be another great one. This movie is just boring.

0452270073|5.0|Honestly, my teacher assigned the book.  I would never have picked up the book.  It just did not sound like \\"my thing.\\"  Reaccounting the horrors of war just plain worries me.  I guess I always fear the author will regurgitate cold, hard quasi-facts wrapped up in a political agenda.  Thankfully for me, my teacher has wonderful taste.  The book is emotional.  It focuses less on the physical and more the mental well-being and change in the war combattants.  Constant peaks into the characters' minds allows the reader to engage with the characters on a personal level and see them develop.  There are no clear cut answers.  They live in a perpetual grey, faced with hard decisions, and split loyalties.  This book will make the reader question what the reader thinks, and give a whole new spin on the evils of war.  Although, the book constantly has humorous moments; I'll never be able to look at a billygoat the same.  It's an emotional experience of a lifetime.
B000025OG6|4.0|'Kingdom of Desire' is the album that got me seriously listening to Toto for the first time. Previously I'd always seen them as a smooth light pop rock group of great musos who only occasionally stretched out. A friend bought me the album and told me to listen to the last track, 'Jake to the bone'. I put on the CD, listened, was shocked, grabbed the cover to ensure that it was indeed a Toto album and since then have been an avid Toto fan.<br /><br />This album rocks; has edge, yet still has the high production qualities, tight harmonies and soaring lead breaks that was typical of the best of their earlier albums.<br /><br />That first track I listened to,'Jake to the bone', is a blistering, lengthy rock fusion instrumental that sounds more like Dream Theater. This was Jeff Porcaro showing that not only was he the groovemeister but could thrash out in odd time signatures as well. How tragic that this final track was also to be his last with Toto. After hearing the track a few times I started to listen to the album from the beginning.<br /><br />I was blown away - 'Gypsy Train' sounds like a Van Halen flatout boogie. The drum sound is enormous, but most of all you get to hear a side of Steve Lukather that certainly was not evident on any previous Toto studio album. Whammy bar and flurries of tapping, he rocks with the best of them. I'd always heard that he was awesome live but at that time had not had the pleasure of seeing him play. I was stunned. And that is probably why many of the previous generations of Toto fans were disappointed as this was too in your face, too Toto ala Los Lobotomys  - the Garfield, Lukather, Colaiuta ad-hoc band. That's not to say that their expected ballads and funkier songs don't appear on this album - it's just that even on the most ordinary of songs there are always delightful segues to Luke solos unlike anything on all previous albums, plus Luke as the main vocalist!<br /><br />The penultimate track, 'Kingdom of Desire' starts with an overwhelming sense that something special is brewing. There is space and the gentle plucking of an overdriven  electric guitar and the crisp hi-hat beat. Each time I hear the beginning of this track I still get chills. Crank your amplifier to not only hear but feel this powerful anthem. This song typifies what I believe started with this album and that was Toto giving up on what the music industry expected and instead decided to play what they liked and how they wanted to.<br /><br />Sadly the album was the end of the Porcaro era, but already the harder more extended Toto approach to compositions had been set.  This landmark Toto album was the beginning of a new, exciting direction for Toto that has seen a resurgence of wonderful world tours and a spate of their best live recordings including their outstanding 25 year anniversary live DVD.with an overwhelming sense that something special is brewing.

B000MXPE7O|1.0|Never before have I been more disappointed in a movie than in this one.  The movie purports to be a fictionalized account of the early days of the CIA and its World War II predecessor, the OSS.  In the corpus of the film, it is difficult to determine what is fact and what is fiction.  Much of the presentation is simply implausible.  All of it is morally bankrupt.  And the movie is far too long, especially given that it is not particularly interesting.<br /><br />Matt Damon is cast as what appears to be a composite character, intended to represent some of the original CIA/OSS men.  He performs reasonably well in a poorly conceived role.  But the casting of the stunning and luminous Angelina Jolie as the stay-at-home wife who interests him not is patently absurd.  Be serious, folks.  Does Ms. Jolie, in her prime, really bore you?<br /><br />The early scenes of the Skull and Bones connection to the CIA are worthwhile in a historical sense.  But do we really need to see older Bonesmen urinating on the intitiates to appreciate their depravity?  We think not.<br /><br />This movie is far too long.  It is not well made.  The movie employs seemingly random flashbacks that make it nearly impossible to follow.  It is a morally bankrupt presentation that it is best ignored.  Robert De Niro should stick to acting.  This film is a major artistic failure.
0307277887|5.0|I am always looking for something new and fresh when I choose books.  This one did not disappoint.  I was hooked from beginning to end, and could not put the book down.   <br /> <br />One thing that did annoy me slightly was that the subject of Dexter's emotional capacity (or lack thereof) was repeated constantly.  Fortunately, in the last two chapters of the book this ended up becoming very important.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|I have been a Rush fan since they first appeared on the scene.  No band had had the guts to update, change, be progressive in their style and format as Rush.  I would venture to say this band does not progress, they evolve.  Every new album is an exploration forward.  Every new album moves the limits of progressive rock forward.  This is a great Rush album which takes us in a new direction (an acoustic foundation), but still, when you close your eyes, you know it is Rush.  The best lyricist in the business (Neal Peart) is on his game and familiar themes appear, i.e. working your way through life...  There is a reason Rush is one of my favorite bands of all time, Snakes & Arrows does not change that notion.

People who read a lot will enjoy this book, and squirrel away the name of Markus Zusak knowing that all of the signs are there that he could one day pull off an all around 5-star job.   <br /> <br />People who read at the pace of a book or two in as many months will probably feel a bit gipped, especially by the attempt at a \\"gotcha\\" ending that doesn't quite come off. <br /> <br />The book is not airtight, but it is still a real accomplishment and I look forward to Mr. Zusak's next title.

1591396190|1.0|Much of the theories and methods described in the book have been covered in listless marketing books.  <br /> <br />The line graphs that the argument is based on is based on an arbitrary positioning of the different factors along the chart.  You can make any companies look like one that has opened up a so-called \\"blue ocean of uncontested market space\\" on the line graphs by simply moving the factors along the line. <br /> <br />Secondly, the survey / research cited never offers clear definition of key terminologies used, no clear explanation on how the research sample was chosen and no clear list of when or where that research actually took place. <br /> <br />It is a book that is written to wow readers with a pleasing visual image with contents that are recycled from past marketing books and arbitrary use of statistics that will not even hold on an academic level. <br /> <br />A total waste of money.

However, I had to see it because it was written by Joss Whedon.  Needless to say, I've fallen and fallen hard for this great little story.  Heart-broken like the rest of you who yearn for more and seething at the short-sghted networks who cancelled it. <br /> <br />Watch this series and movie for its supberb writing, provacative plot-line and engaging characters.  It's imaginative, funny, suspensful and totally entertaining.

0375831002|5.0|Born in Sydney in 1975, Markus Zusak is the youngest of four children and the son of Austrian and German parents. He grew up hearing stories about Nazi Germany, two of which led to him writing \\"The Book Thief\\".     The story is told by Death, who tries not to take too much of an interest in humans - sometimes, however, he can't help himself. In \\"The Book Thief\\", Death follows the story of Liesel Meminger - a young German girl he first meets in January 1939. Liesel is nine years old and travelling by train to Munich with her mother and brother, Werner. Liesel's mother is having difficulty providing for her family and is constantly ill. In the hope of a better life for her children, she has arranged for them to be fostered with a family in Molching - a town close to Munich. Here, she hopes they will be fed and educated better than she could provide. Unfortunately, Werner doesn't make it - he dies and is buried on the journey, giving Death his first meeting with Liesel. Werner's funeral is where the Book Thief is born, when Liesel 'acquires' a copy of \\"The Gravediggers Handbook\\". Her pilfering, naturally, doesn't finish there - and it isn't always restricted to books.    Liesel's new family, the Hubermanns, live on Himmel Street in Molching. Liesel's new foster-mother is the foul-mouthed and (apparently) permanently cross Rosa Hubermann. Even worse, her cooking is as bad as her language. Hans, Liesel's 'new' father, is a different matter entirely. He's a kind, loving and patient man, who works as a painter and is a WW1 veteran. His main pleasures in life are centred around tobacco and playing the accordion. He also teaches Liesel read and write - something Liesel is very keen on - with \\"The Gravediggers Handbook\\" being used as the starting point in her education. After Hans, two other men play a big part in Liesel's life in Molching. One is her permanently hungry best friend Rudy Steiner, who is also a big fan of Jesse Owens. (This is just the sort of thing that couldget you in trouble in Nazi Germany). Although Rudy is always on the lookout for food, there's only one thing he's truly desperate for : a kiss from Liesel. The Book Thief's 'other' best friend isn't introduced until a little further into the book : a Jewish man by the name of Max, who - like Liesel - is a fairly useful fighter.     \\"The Book Thief\\" was published in Australia as an 'adult' title, but as a Young Adult novel in America. The truth is, both age ranges will enjoy this story - it's very easily read book, with very likeable characters - Liesel, Hans and Rudy particularly stood out for me. Death proves to be a sympathetic, likeable and even, occasionally, witty character - something this Death has in common with Terry Pratchett's Death. (Of course, there's a lot less silliness and a good deal more sadness here than in one of the Discworld books). A beautiful book, well worth reading.
B0001GL3K4|1.0|After 20 minutes of watching this film, I knew that I had had enough. Vulgarity for its own sake. Poorly directed. No respect for some fine actors, who should be ashamed of themselves. It's a far cry from Four Weddings and a Funeral.
B00008973A|1.0|I have seen the stage version 3 times and loved it every time. When I saw this film version I was thoroughly disappointed in the way Atteborough changed the plot. On the stage, Casie was already part pf the audition and Zack was trying very hard to discourage her. The song \\"what I did for love\\" was not sung by Cassie but by one of the girls after one of the dancers is injured, and Zack asks them how they feel. The song is about love of dancing, not for the love of 2 people. The best part of the movie is the finale, the rest is trash.
B00005214X|5.0|You don't have to believe in God to fall in love with album, but it helps.  Many of Harrison's wonderful songs are addressed directly to the Lord.  George's classic hit My Sweet Lord is here, and the seasoned ear can determine for themselves whether or not he ripped off He's So Fine by the Chiffons (he didn't.)  The Shy Beatle's gentle voice is wistful and spiritual, and Eric Clapton (uncredited, due to record label issues) tears up some elegiac and soulful guitar licks.  Just beautiful. The last third of the album is pretty much take it or leave it.  After a cohesive double album of spiritual, love, and playful songs, George rocks out on four long instrumental jams.  I don't listen to them very often.  But the bulk of the album is great.  There is a wonderful cover of Dylan's If Not For You on disc one, as well as the classic What Is Life, featured in Goodfellas.  The bonus songs new to this edition are also keepers, especially I Live For  You, which is a beautiful song that fits in perfectly with the other tracks.  Listen to this album and you'll dig love too.
1400063515|4.0|I'm not entirely certain what to make of this book. On one hand, it seemed like a fairly convincing rejection of a great deal of prominent statistical and economic theory. But let's face it, very few people are equipped to evaluate Taleb's assertions and decide for themselves whether he's right. It sounded reasonable enough to me, and at least from the standpoint of layman's logic it was enough to convince me that he's on to something, but beyond that there's simply no way on earth I can hope to understand the complex mathematical ideas he talks about in the book.<br /><br />The Black Swan is part of what seems to have become a popular trend lately, whereby people with grand ideas present them to the general public rather than to their peers (though Taleb doesn't seem to think he really has any peers - I'll get to that in a moment). Books like Freakonomics, The Tipping Point, and Blink are other examples of thinkers selling their ideas directly to laymen like myself (who are in no way qualified to judge the validity of their ideas) rather than subjecting them to academic scrutiny. Taleb insists that there's no point in doing that because the academic community is too narrow-minded or foolish to give his ideas a fair shake (or to even understand them). Again, I have no way of knowing whether that's true. Maybe it is. Or maybe it's just easier to hawk your ideas to the public for $27 a pop and bypass professional scrutiny altogether. I don't know.<br /><br />Another thing these books have in common is the everything-you-think-you-know-about-the-world-is-totally-wrong theme. I know it's thrilling to think that we have made a new discovery that will revolutionize the world, but these authors can't ALL be right. The problem is that there's really no way for the layperson to know who's right (if any of them are). Their ideas sound compelling enough, but how can we know they're any smarter than the people they say are wrong?<br /><br />On a more substantive level, one thing I disliked about The Black Swan was its seemingly scattershot approach to things and the author's tendency to ramble. It is mainly a book that covers sweeping concepts with few specifics, but then all of a sudden Taleb will do something like recommend precise allocations for your portfolio out of the blue without expanding on them (but don't get too excited even about the portfolio recommendation, because even it is far from being the kind of investment advice that you can do much with). The ending was also a bit odd. Taleb concludes by pulling a line straight out of the popular self-help book \\"Don't Sweat the Small Stuff\\" when he says, well, that you shouldn't sweat the small stuff. But that's not really what the book was about. Instead, Taleb consistently makes several dire warnings about the kinds of horrible things that can happen when we fail to take into the account of unforeseeable and random events - hardly \\"small stuff.\\"<br /><br />Finally, I have to say that Taleb comes off as somewhat of a jerk throughout the book. To say that he is arrogant is a bit of an understatement. He goes out of his way to pump himself up as one of the only truly enlightened people alive today. Along the way, he dismisses anyone who dares to disagree with him as a fool, a philistine, or worse.<br /><br />I actually did enjoy reading The Black Swan, and overall I found it compelling and intriguing - certainly food for thought. So I don't mean to disparage it. I'm actually surprised to read my own review and see how negative it is because I definitely think this book is worth reading. I just think it could have been significantly better if more thought had been put into making it more focused and if Taleb had resisted the temptation to engage in personal attacks on those who disagree with him. The issues he discusses are obviously extremely complex, so there's nothing wrong with simply admitting that reasonable minds can differ about them without someone being stupid or foolish.<br /><br />So, to sum it up, I recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject, but go into it with a skeptical mind, just as Taleb says he does when he approaches an idea.foolish. <br /> <br />So, to sum it up, I recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject, but go into it with a skeptical mind, just as Taleb says he does when he approaches an idea.

B00000I8UF|5.0|October 30, 1958. Those great days at the Rudy Van Gelder studio in his parents living room in Hackenack, New Jersey. This is ESSENTIAL JAZZ. So many people have given this a 5 star review, so I guess there isn't much more I can say about it. But Lee Morgan on trumpet and BENNY GOLSON on Tenor Sax will blow you away. Blakey of course is the KING as far as I'm concerned. I rarely missed the gigs he did at the Village Vanguard in the Seventies. Everyone plays better when Blakey is pushing them. Bobby Timmons is so great, and the great song \\"MOANIN'\\" by Timmons, really shines on here. 4 cuts written by Golson, the whole CD is up there with the greatest. This is ESSENTIAL jazz at its best.

068485743X|5.0|What a refreshing book. One of the only books that actually tries to improve your manuscripts by telling you how to fix the problems editors don't like. And it all makes sense. It won't tell you how to write. That's not the purpose of this book. But it will tell you what NOT to write. A honest, straighforward book that does not sugarcoat everything. Publishing your book is very hard and this book does its best to make sure you put all chances on your side.

B00006AFUR|5.0|When I first listened to this CD I was expecting something similar to their second CD.  Their second cd has some good songs on it, but overall it just isn't that unique and is completely different.  Anyways, this CD is like I said, Nothing at all like the first.  This is a good thing.  It has a really unique sound to it and really grows on you when you listen to it.  All I can say is they should have made their second cd more like this one, not emo garb that gives them a mediocre name to anyone without a flippy hairdue.  Most people have not listened to this and base the band soley off of their second album.  Give this one a chance.
0783233477|5.0|Today is the first time I have seen this movie and I must say I am amazed at the depth of the story and the love in the family.  I had no idea how deep and moving the story was.  Admittedly, I had no interest in seeing this movie when it first came out because I am not a Brad Pitt fan, but I have to admit he puts on an amazing performance in his ability to show his love for Susan through his facial expressions...just breathtaking. <br /> <br />Sir Anthony Hopkins also delivered an amazing performance, as always.  Regardless of what role he is playing in a movie, he always manages to take me breath away; I just love him.  He is one of few actors in Hollywood would actually enjoy meeting.
B0000025KI|3.0|I remember when this 2-record vinyl album came out in 1980.  I was still in college and thought it was just an awesome progression from Darkness On the Edge of Town and Born to Run.  But listening to The River today, some 27 years later, I've got more mixed feelings.   <br /> <br />Bear with me while we go down memory lane, track by track! <br /> <br />Ties That Bind -- It's a pretty good song for an album opener. Clarence (remember him?) gets off a swell sax solo. <br /> <br />Sherry Darling -- a kinda fun tune; frat rock indeed. <br /> <br />Jackson Cage -- Yeah, Boss, being in jail sucks.  Weak choice for your #3 song.  Danny's (Farfisa?) organ makes a big appearance here, 1 of MANY... <br /> <br />Two Hearts -- Starts out promising.  Max's drumming almost saves this fun albeit commercial tune.  \\"Two hearts are better than one/Two hearts girl get the job done.\\"  Okay...what about 3 hearts? <br /> <br />Independence Day -- Not bad; a classic Bruce lament. <br /> <br />Hungry Heart -- Bruce celebrates leaving \\"a wife and kids in Baltimore...\\" and going \\"out for a ride and I never went back.\\"  Okay, it's just a story.  Clarence gets to blow again here.  Cut from the same cloth as Two Hearts.  Another of many organ-dominated tunes here.  Yawn. <br /> <br />Out In the Street -- The first 5-star tune on this album imho.  Classic Bruceian imagery.  Looks back; moves forward to the next level. <br /> <br />Crush On You -- another Sherry Darling-type of \\"party\\" tune.  Clarence gets to make an appearance, but can't bring the tune out from beyond it's numbing repetitiveness. <br /> <br />You Can Look -- Fun Bruce at his best.  Why didn't Chuck Berry get a co-writing credit here? <br /> <br />I Wanna Marry You -- No, Bruce, no you don't!  But since you will record the amazing divorce album,  Tunnel Of Love some 7 years after this, go ahead, get married!  Forgetable dreck here.  Cheesy organ. <br /> <br />The River -- The 2nd amazing 5-star song on this record.  Bruce refineshis vivid storytelling taking it to the next level. <br /> <br />Point Blank -- Now he's talking.  Bruce played this at Winterland in 1978 right after the Moscone and Milk assassinations.  Still chilling. <br /> <br />Cadillac Ranch -- You gotta have a Car Song on any 2 record set and this 1 is still kinda fun. <br /> <br />I'm a Rocker -- Nice beat, Max, but forgetable lyrics, Boss... <br /> <br />Fade Away -- Typically uber-Sincere Bruce lament about not wanting his woman to ditch him.  Yawn. Move on, Bruce.  Sorry, Boss.  Danny's damn organ playing is getting to me.   <br /> <br />Stolen Car -- Nebraska-like, but in a boring contrived way.  Where's Clarence? <br /> <br />Ramrod -- Another Car = Sex song.  Cadillac Ranch was enough.  Oh here's BIG MAN... And that damn organ again, droning on... <br /> <br />The Price You Pay -- Sounds like Bruce can use some No-Doz on this one.  Or this listener. <br /> <br />Drive All Night -- This was actually a pretty good song, but at 8:33 probably 4 minutes too long.   <br />Bruce sounds so sincere...um, you can end the song now...\\"through the wind, through the rain, through the snow, the wind, the rain...\\"  Just like your friendly US Postal Delivery Man. <br /> <br />Wreck On the Highway -- Strange Bummer choice to end the album.  Another tune that didn't make it on Nebraska.  Zzzzz. <br /> <br />Conclusion: With a few exceptions, The River today simply sounds tired and dated.  There's more life in the Seeger Sessions, which I don't get totally, but I can tell Bruce was having fun there.  But here?  He was in another time and space, and for that matter, so am I.

B000P0J02E|5.0|At World's End, much like its counterparts, Dead Man's Chest and The Curse of the Black Pearl, is strong on powerful action pieces.  Hans Zimmer manages a very well balanced flavor of romantic melodies and heavy orchestra tracks that keep the listeners compelled all the way.  I loved the music in this soundtrack so much, especially \\"Up is Down\\" and \\"Drink up me Hearties\\", which have the adventurous main theme of the final film.   <br />As usual, the Jack Sparrow bits are fun cues, and the Davy Jones romance theme is just wonderful and spellbinding. Hans Zimmer delivers a strong finishing touch to the trilogy.  I highly recommend this excellent soundtrack.
B000MZHW40|4.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />\\"In America it's bling bling, but out here it's bling bang,\\" says Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) in this action-packed flick about Africa's corrupt diamond trade.\\" kevin O'Donnell<br /><br />This movie took awhile to become enmeshed in the story. Much could be edited but then, maybe that is what you need in order to survive the  violence of the film.  'Blood Diamond' takes place in 1999 Sierra Leone, when the country is involved in a civil war. It is difficult at times to decide which side is the most evil; the government or the rebels. It is the innocent farmers caught in between the fighting who pay the price. Diamonds, one of the country's largest moneymakers, are being smuggled out and purchased on the open market, There is a ban on purchasing these 'blood diamonds', but merchants prevail.<br /><br />Solomon Vandy, Djimon Hounsan, is a farmer. He educates his son for a better life. And then one day the rebels capture his son. Solomon is sent to sift for diamonds, and he  finds a 100-karat pink diamond. He meets a soldier of fortune, Danny Archer, Leonardo DiCaprio, who makes a deal for the diamond. Archer will help him find his wife and children for the diamond. They meet an American journalist, Maddy Brown, Jennifer Connelly, who agrees to help them if she can write about their experiences.  The violence and the bloodshed are so real and caused me to close my eyes. The boy solders who are taught to kill are so real and evil. Blood Diamond is as effective in depicting the corruption of innocent people as it is in showing the hell of war. It also highlights greed and manipulation.<br /><br />\\"Archer. Leonardo DiCaprio, has the most complete role. Thankfully, he never loses his \\"me first\\" attitude, but we come to understand how it has developed and we see a gradual softening of some of his morals. It's a solid performance from Leonardo DiCaprio, who has grown into this sort of \\"gritty\\" role and is more believable after having been seen dancing on the dark side in The Departed. This is not the same actor who set young female hearts aflutter ten years ago. He has discovered a measure of gravitas. Solomon's passion drives the movie forward; when Blood Diamond has urgency, it's because of him. Djimon Hounsou is volcanic in this role.\\" James Berardinelli<br /><br />This could have been the movie of the year were it not for the length and the tediousness of the first 45 minutes. The movie grabbed me for the last hour. It was rivieting and the story one that needs to be told.

Djimon Hounsou is volcanic in this role.\\" James Berardinelli     This could have been the movie of the year were it not for the length and the tediousness of the first 45 minutes. The movie grabbed me for the last hour. It was rivieting and the story one that needs to be told. The message, other than the sory of civil war and the diamond trade, is that Leonardo Di Caprio has found his measure.     Highly Recommended. prisrob 6-03-07    [[ASIN:B000M5AJQS The Departed (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]
B000NW681A|2.0|This is an odd movie. Half of the movie is devoted to the recording of the Rolling Stones song Sympathy for the Devil and half is devoted to Jean Luc Goddard's silly surealistic social commentary masquarading as absurdist farce. Historically the Stones's section is incredible. What you see are the Stones writing Sympathy in the studio, rearranging the song, with the results being radically different from the songs' initial form. You also get to see the by that time pathetic and drugged out Brian Jones limply playing acoustic guitar so out of it he doesn't even realize he's not miked and therefore not being recorded. This part of the film is facinating and of real interest to any Stones or rock fan, even those just interested in the creative process. Unfortunately the Stones in the studio sections are interupted with brief and whimsically absurdist skits that range from mildly interesting at best to irritating and inconsequential. Goddard tries cheaply to weave some sort of surrealistic social commentary around the Stones song and fails miserably. Both the onscreen antics and the trite thought behind them are both amateurish and poorly executed and have nothing whatsoever to do with the Rolling Stones. Which of course means that I found half of the film to be of little interest. I'd skip this one.
B000002UAU|3.0|Be prepared for a less than satisfying audio experience. Don't get me wrong, the music, performance, and production are everything you've already read about. It's just that this album (and the rest of the Beatles catalog for that matter) haven't been remastered in twenty some years. Back then, digital audio was still pretty new, and a lot of generations of computer technology have come and gone since then. We've seen what this technology can do with other releases, but none of this technological muscle has been used to clean up this or any other Beatles release. Why hasn't Pepper or any of the other essential albums of the Beatles catalog received the same audio upgrade that Pet Sounds has received? Aren't McCartney, Starr, and Martin embarrassed by how their records sound when compared with the remastered Stones or Dylan catalogs? It makes absolutely no sense that you have to wade through an inch of audio mud and tape hiss to listen to one of the most influential catalogs in the last fifty years of pop music, but there it is. Please guys, Martin isn't getting any younger and neither are your master tapes. Get it all remastered and put it out on SACD or DVD audio before its too late! Until that day happens though, put on your hip wading boots and dig in. It's still worth the mess.  <br />

B000KKPN5C|5.0|You wouldn't, or shouldn't, be reading this if you do not have a Nikon with iTTL. It is compact and works flawlessly if you do not want to eat up your camera's battery when using flash. Advantages of bounce over the direct flash on whichever Nikon body you own, is overwhelming. Do not expect a flash unit of this size to bounce off of a high ceiling, but a large index card overcomes that problem. There is not enough offset from the lens for fill flash with a large lens hood, but you can't expect everything from such a compact unit. Although I have many compact non-Nikon flashes, the proprietary electronics of the present day Nikons almost requires using their flash systems to get optimum metering.
B0004Z33G4|4.0|The Rambo trilogy was, for many, a symbol of the 1980s.  Following the story of former Green Beret and Vietnam vet John Rambo, each of the 3 Rambo movies was a bit different in flavor than the others.  For whatever reasons, the Rambo movies were co-opted by politics.  Reagan infamously declared \\"Rambo is a Republican\\", much the same way he tried to glom on to \\"Star Wars\\" and Springsteen's \\"Born In The USA\\" as symbols to boost his own popularity.  For others, the name \\"Rambo\\" became the symbol of what was seen as American ignorance and a \\"shoot first\\" attitude.  These attitudes do seem to indicate some misunderstanding of the Rambo character, and even the movies.  In any case, as the 1980s faded (and people began to react negatively to the Reagan era's now obvious facade of machismo), this association ended up hurting Sly Stallone's career, despite his ample abilities.  It was unfortunate really, as Stallone has generally proven to be dependable in most of his work, such as his portrayal of the likeable loser Freddy in \\"Copland\\".  It was Stallone's ability to infuse the Rambo character with a sense of humanity that was indicative of his work as an action star; this ability would prove useful in providing \\"Daylight\\" and \\"Cliffhanger\\" with somewhat believable action hero protagonists (but was sadly MIA in the turkey \\"Judge Dredd\\". <br /> <br />   The Rambo Trilogy was originally released on DVD, with a bonus disc chronicling the Rambo legacy.  Unfortunately, this \\"Ultimate Collection\\" fails to include that bonus material, instead giving us a \\"Metavision\\" gimmick, which ultimately proves a poor substitute.  The lack of extras is the biggest mark against this release.  Thankfully, Sylvester Stallone's commentary on First Blood remains intact, and provides a remarkable amount of insight into the movie's creation and backstory.  The commentary tracks on the other two movies, however, are not up to the same standards, in part due to the lack of any actor commentary. <br/> <br />    \\"First Blood\\" is probably the most different in tone of the trilogy, and focuses on Rambo's loss of identity after leaving the military.  Drifting from town to town, Rambo finds himself alone and unable to fit into peacetime society.  When small town sheriff Teagle (himself a veteran of the Korean War), played with consummate professionalism by Brian Dennehy, decides to throw Rambo in jail for vagrancy, Rambo's survival instincts are triggered by a flashback to his days in a Vietnamese POW camp.  As a result, Rambo escapes to the mountains in dramatic fashion, and is pursued by Teagle and his posse.  Naturally, the situation escalates as Rambo reverts to his commando training, and the well armed, but poorly trained locals end up over their heads.  Rambo's old commander, Trautman, shows up to try to bring Rambo in quietly and without bloodshed.  In the end, however, Rambo returns to town in explosive fashion, with the intent of making Teagle pay.  Trautman finally intervenes before Rambo can kill Teagle, and Rambo, in an emotional climax, breaks down in tears, and allows himself to be taken into custody.  \\"First Blood\\" is certainly more realistic and restrained than the later Rambo movies, and has an undercurrent of quiet tragedy in seeing a proud soldier being rejected not by \\"the commie left wing\\", but by Main Street America itself. <br /> <br />    While \\"First Blood\\" was more nuanced, \\"Rambo: First Blood Part 2\\" was was an attempt to create a sort of over-the-top, military piece writ mythic.  This time around, George Cosmatos took the director's chair, with the script being written by James Cameron (yes, THAT James Cameron)and Sylvester Stallone, based on a story by Kevin Jarre.  At the time, the Cold War had risen to a fever pitch.  The movie involves Rambo being sprung from military prison by the government and his old commander Trautman, in exchange for participation in a recon mission in Vietnam to look for POWs.  In Thailand, Rambo meets the shady bureaucrat Murdock, who is in charge of the mission.  Once back in the jungle (after a disastrous air drop), Rambo meets up with Vietnamese rebel Co Bao, played by the beautiful Julia Nickson.  Apparently, Ms. Nickson received a Razzie for worst debut performance in this movie; however, given the bad, stereotypical pidgeon English she was forced to recite, I doubt that Judi Dench could have done much better with the source material.  When Rambo actually finds and rescues a POW, and brings him back to the rendezvous point, Murdock pulls the plug and strands Rambo in the jungle, where he is captured, and is subsequently tortured by Padovsky, a Russian commander who is in Vietnam for some reason.  It's up to Co Bao to help Rambo escape, and before it's over, Rambo adds a few hundred notches to his kill count, and even blows up a Russian helicopter gunship.  <br /> <br />While the movie is pure Hollywood hyperbole, it is executed in a surprisingly epic fashion.  This was before action movies had required clever catch phrases, multiple slow-motion shots of the same milk truck exploding, and other overtly self-conscious cliches.  There is even a tidbit of criticism of the politics which led to the Vietnam War in the form of a veiled reference to the military-industrial complex, as well as some surprisingly artistic cinematography (such as the requisite tragic death scene).  But let's not fool ourselves: this was not meant to be high art, but rather a high action movie, and it succeeds.  Stallone's ability to effectively emote stands in bizarre contrast to Rambo's overly-muscled figure, and provides just the right amount of surreal affability to make the wholesale destruction watchable.  Of particular note is Jerry Goldsmith's outstanding musical score, which is probably one of the most epic soundtracks I've yet to see in a military action movie. <br /> <br />    \\"Rambo 3\\", the illogically titled third entry, was released at a time when big budget Hollywood movies werebecoming more formulaic and predictable, and it does show in the final product.  The conceit this time is that Rambo is reluctantly brought out of early retirement at a monastery (of all places), to rescue Colonel Trautman, who was captured by the Russians in Afghanistan.  This time, Rambo hooks up with Afghan freedom fighters to stop a ruthless Russian territorial commander.  This movie simultaneously tries to be more tongue-in-cheek, and yet also more serious, with its sermonizing about the Russian occupation of Afghanistan.  The movie works, but not as well as its predecessors.  What's even more bizarre, of course, is watching it in the context of post-9-11 geopolitics, as some of Rambo's allies may have well gone on to join the Taliban, and help Bin Laden's terrorist activities.  Fortunately, the action is still explosive, although by this point, it was starting to become a little too predictable. <br /> <br />   For the last few years, there have been rumors about a possible \\"Rambo 4\\", and it appears that a fourth installment, simply named \\"John Rambo\\", is finally officially on its way.  It's unclear whether it will be able to make an impact in this day and age, or whether it will have the same \\"sheen of consummate professionalism\\" as the first 3. In any case, the movies are what they are: well-executed action entertainment.  While the DVD extras are sparse (you know we all would love Stallone and Julia Nickson to be on the Rambo commentary track), the movies themselves work well.

B000O178BY|2.0|I've never been a fan of NIN, and this album just raises my dislike for Trent. This album is boring, repetitive, empty, and musically lacking.  <br /> <br />Trent should stop focusing on a fictional message and start focusing on making good music with depth and originality. Repeated distortions and one-note synth presses aren't going to cut it for me. In order for Trent to get my attention, he's going to have to pull something really, really great out of his hat for me for his next album.  <br /> <br />For now, I find NIN still repetitive and uninteresting. Not impressed at all.

0385484518|4.0|This book is about a former student's lessons on life as he visits a dying professor each week. Morrie, the professor sums up the value of these visits:<br /><br />\\"People see me as a bridge.\\" He says. \\"I'm not as alive as I used to be, but I'm not yet dead.\\"<br /><br />Other reviewers thought the book simplistic, and sometimes the awkward writing does get in the way (the reason for 4 stars instead of 5). But the simplicity makes the story more endearing, like having afternoon tea with your dear old grandfather. The conversation is relaxing, calming, uplifting. The old man's words comfort you. Platitudes? Perhaps, occasionally. But like an old familiar song or poem, it makes you remember, again, what life is about.<br /><br />\\"Look at the view out that window.\\" Morrie says. \\"I appreciate it more than you do. I appreciate it because I'm losing it . . . The living have it backwards. They value their work and their possessions and their money when in the end, it's only nature, and as I said before, love, that satisfies.\\"<br /><br />The book invites you to face your own death.<br /><br /> \\"Everyone knows they're going to die, but nobody believes it. . . . To know you're going to die, and to be prepared for it at any time, is better. That way you can be more involved in your life while you're living.\\"<br /><br />The end of the book is like the end of your visit with Grandpa.As you pick up your things to leave, your grandfather dies. You're sorry, but grateful to have had the time with him. Bittersweet. The book ends, a life is over, but the message lives on.<br /><br />\\"Death ends a life, not a relationship.\\" Morrie said to his student. \\"Our relationship will live on, but it will be different. Come to visit me at my grave. This time, you talk, I'll listen.\\"<br /><br />I recommend reading this book on a lazy afternoon when you can be alone without interruption. Bring a hanky, you're sure to cry.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|As a fan of Lost, Heroes, Grey's Anatomy, Prison Break, I have 2 say that this season of Supernatural surpass all of these shows. It has an a amazing cast. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles. Jensen has had the most amazing scenes this season and Jared has learned so much this season. Both there performances have been completely amazing!! I'm just in awe when I see there scenes together. The episodes, writing, directing has gotten better with every new episode. This second season is more emotional and darker than the first. This show doesn't get the promotion that it should get. It has held up it's own in ratings while being in the toughest time slot in tv history (Thrusdays at 9pm)and in The CW (A new network) This show is not a teeny bopper show, and I hate that ppl think that just because it's on the CW.<br /><br />Best episodes of season 2:<br /><br />In My Time Of Dying<br /><br />Simon Saids<br /><br />Hunted<br /><br />Croatron<br /><br />Night Shifter<br /><br />Born Under A Bad Sign<br /><br />Tall Tales<br /><br />Heart<br /><br />Folsem Prison Blues<br /><br />What is and What Should Never Be<br /><br />All Hell Breaks Loose PT 1<br /><br />All Hell Breaks Loose PT 2<br /><br />I personally loved them all, and it's really hard to find a show, where every episode is awesome!<br /><br />This show has humor, drama, action, horror, everything a story needs to be great. This isn't another show about a boy and girl with a Will they or won't they story. It's about 2 brothers, who would do anything 4 their family, even if they aren't always on the best of terms. It's a real relationship not some 7th heaven fake family. They go thru so much pain, that they really just want 2 give it up, but at the end realize that saving lives is worth all the pain they go thru even if it's not fair. They are real heroes.<br /><br />I haven't been completely in awe with a show since Roswell, so trust me when I say you'll fall in love with this show.<br /><br />It doesn't hurt that the only 2 regulars are completely hot 2!!<br /><br />A must-own DVD for die-hard TV FANS!!<br /> <br />A must-own DVD for die-hard TV FANS!!

I can understand why a record producer might get off on adding all that sound to \\"deepen\\" and \\"broaden\\" the sound, but I'm just a working stiff who likes the Beatles.

B00005JMYI|5.0|Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy<br /><br />Released on July 9, 2004<br /><br />Written by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay<br /><br />Directed by Adam McKay<br /><br />Anchorman is a very funny movie, but it is inconsistent in tone. They do anything for a laugh, and ad libbing was encouraged by director Adam McKay, but it often veers off track, and the story is pretty stupid. It just doesn't make sense, half the time. That being said, it has some of the funniest scenes ever filmed, and I'm sure there were a lot of laughs, on screen and off.<br /><br />It begins with the following narration, spoken by announcer Bill Lawson: \\"There was a time, a time before cable. When the local anchorman reigned supreme. When people believed everything they heard on TV. This was an age when only men were allowed to read the news. And in San Diego, one anchorman was more man then the rest. His name was Ron Burgundy. He was like a god walking amongst mere mortals. He had a voice that could make a wolverine purr and suits so fine they made Sinatra look like a hobo. In other words, Ron Burgundy was the balls.\\"<br /><br />There is the movie in a nutshell. It is very funny in spurts, but spins out of control just as often. The problem is that the funniest parts could also be the out of control ones. Will Ferrell is excellent as Ron Burgundy, all empty headed and puffed up with self importance. There are great scenes of the news team doing the purposeful walk, wearing 70s style suits, it is so right on and true to the period.<br /><br />Another problem is the theme of a woman breaking into the male dominated world of TV News. It tries to be too PC, and that gets in the way of the comedy. Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) doesn't know if she wants to play it as a professional or a conniving slattern. Does she loath Ron Burgundy or love him? If she is as intelligent as she appears, then how could she love someone as ignorant as Burgundy? Should the movie mock her, or should it just mock Ron and the other male chauvinists?<br /><br />I like the part where Ron Burgundy comes home and talks to his dog, Baxter. Also outstanding was the scene where Ron Burgundy jams at a jazz club with his flute. There is a running gag where the other news teams rumble, and one of them gets his arm ripped off. Later, when everyone is trying to cover the Panda being born at the San Diego Zoo, he is shown with one arm. I just wish they could have shown as much care for the other plot lines that led nowhere.<br /><br />I want to emphasize that I think this is a very funny movie, and I recommend it, but it gets silly at times. There are some very funny people in it. Paul Rudd, David Koechner, Steve Carrell, Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Fred Armisen, Vince Vaughn, Fred Willard, Owen Wilson, and Chris Parnell, as well as co-anchors Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate.

B000O77RLE|1.0|If you hate America, and ignore history, this is the movie for you.  First of all, the movie was extremely boring, mostly dialog (in Japanese with sub-titles), very little war action.  As the movie progresses, you see that it is really a thinly veiled attack on America, and on war in general.   <br />The movie takes a huge left turn, exemplified by two scenes.  In the first, the Japanese are shown to risk their own lives to run into enemy fire to recover a wounded US soldier, then they treat him with the last of their morphine.  This is in contrast to the scene showing a US soldier shooting 2 unarmed, captured POW's who surrendered so the Americans would give them a meal.   <br />Clint Eastwood must have lost his mind if he thinks my grandfater and his brothers in arms EVER shot an unarmed POW. <br />Please avoid this movie.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Stephen Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST is simply the finest motion picture ever made.<br /><br />The story brings us face to face with the most organized evil of which humanity has yet proven itself capable. Spielberg's direction and performances of Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes attain that level at which matters are simply beyond improvement. One merely stands in awe.<br /><br />After viewing the LIST for just the second time since its debut in 1993, this reviewer can think of no more adequate response than the exhortation to buy, rent, view, and then bow silently or in prayer before the fact of evil and the potency of good.<br /><br />Sadly, it takes a wickedness so vile as to require its own language to occasion a work of art so noble in its conception and execution that language fails to describe it.<br /><br />'The LIST', as Kingsley's Yitzhak Stern says with a different intent, 'is an absolute good.'

It's actually pretty cool. Don't get me wrong, both complete versions are of the albums are fine. It's...... well, I won't repeat myself. Just enjoy.
B00000I07R|5.0|After both Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora released solo albums and a four-year hiatus, the duo joined forces to release Keep the Faith, which was meant to be a more serious album right from the get-go. Besides carrying the band's arena rock anthems, it was also meant to be a nod to the working-class ethics of Bruce Springsteen, focusing heavily on thoughtout lyrics and messages -- and it became a success.<br /><br />The Springsteen influence is remarkable on the album opener \\"I Believe\\": it merges the signature Bon Jovi sound treated to a more updated version and the gospel revivalist feel of Springsteen songs. Sambora's guitar wail is carefully placed under the thick bass stomp and Bon Jovi's trademark screams, but the melody is gripping and infectious. As with earlier releases, Desmond Child helped them finish two other hits: the ambitious title track, driven by an amazing vocal delivery, profound lyrics, and Torres' drum syncopation; and the more upbeat number \\"I'll Sleep When I'm Dead\\", which revisits the band's earlier hook-laden cuts, chock full of catchy choruses and harmony vocals.<br /><br />The reason why Keep the Faith stands out from its predecessor is certainly the inclusion of songs exhibiting more maturity and depth. \\"Dry Country\\", at nearly minutes, is an amazing melodic hard rocker graced by a timeless melody. The piano theme that sets the tone of the piece is cleverly repeated during the pre-chorus and simultaneously as the lyrics are delivered -- it's a sign of Jon Bon Jovi's mastery of hook and songwriting. Even Richie Sambora, whose guitar work has always been behind the band's crushing rhythm section, gets to put his lead playing on display, cutting it loose for a good two minutes.<br /><br />Likewise, while still serving his pop-driven rock ballads in the form of \\"I Want You\\", Jon Bon Jovi also begins to show signs of artistic growth as both a lyricist and musician. The combination of \\"In These Arms\\" and \\"Bed of Roses\\" is easily the band's most powerful one-two punch ballad ever. The former sees considerable input by David Bryan; he injects neat keyboard work which introduces the main melody for Jon to sing over and add his own touch to it. The latter, on the other hand, is quite possibly the band's most moving song to date. Its beautiful guitar intro, piano motif, and the profoundly emotive vocal style are hard to match in the poppy spectrum of hard rock. Though they may have had bigger hits on the charts, \\"Bed of Roses\\" is the band at their most expressive, and Jon Bovi Jovi at his songwriting best.<br /><br />More guitar-based songs also appear on the CD, such as the bass-rich \\"If I Was Your Mother\\" with a cool chorus; the blues-inflected \\"Blame It on the Love of Rock & Roll\\" with its relentless rhythm groove; and the unapologetically loud \\"Woman in Love\\", driven by Jon Bon Jovi's repeated chorus shout.<br /><br />In many ways, Keep the Faith is the band's finest moment. Unlike their albums released in the 80's, it has a more timeless quality to it and crosses the boundaries of happy-go-lucky pop rock tunes that formed much of that era. Sadly, with the follow-up to this record, These Days, Bon Jovi would lose their appeal to many a long-time fan whilst winning over a whole new legion of followers.

They have always been a band that managed to keep up-to-date with what achieves stardom.
B000NA2BEU|1.0|\\"Veronica Mars\\" used to be a hard-to-miss show for me. While I was never one to consider it \\"the best ever\\" (this kind of hyperbole is cheap and basically untrue), I loved it for what it was: an entertaining and compelling mystery, heartbreaking, harrowing and funny all at once, with mostly complex and intriguing characters. The show was flawed from the start. Important emotional beats were sometimes dropped or glossed over, the view of the class struggle (and other difficult issues) appeared somewhat over-simplified, and there was too much ready reliance on \\"clever\\" twists instead of honest exploration. But the flaws never overshadowed the show's strong points. The easy to root for central character, Veronica Mars, was tough but compassionate, intelligent but prone to mistakes. A victim who refused to be victimized, who struggled, doubted but never gave up.  The supporting cast was top notch. Most notably Enrico Colantoni as Keith Mars (a loving if often clueless father trying to do his best by his daughter and to rebuild his life) and Jason Dohring as Logan Echolls (showing a remarkable range and depth as a contradictory, multi-dimensional, both rough and kind, troublesome and troubled kid with too-adult problems, secret pain, and less-than-healthy coping mechanisms). The over-arcing mysteries were interesting and mostly handled well, keeping the audience guessing and giving them a deserved pay-off in the end. And as an added bonus, the chemistry between several actors was a joy to behold. The father/daughter duo of Keith and Veronica simply delighted, and the unexpected but welcome spark between Veronica and Logan was irresistible.    That was then. This past season can be summed up with one word: disappointment. It's difficult to process the steep drop in quality and all the reasons behind it. Perhaps it was the move to another or the graduation from high school to college network that dictated some of the changes. Both difficult challenges for any show to overcome. But neither of those account for the most glaring problems that plagued this past (and, at this point, thankfully, last) season.     1. The writing. It's inevitable in the business of television that some people leave a writing team and some new ones join it. It's usually an adjustment. However, there's simply no excuse for the sheer laziness and incoherence we were treated to this year. Dropped story-lines, set ups with no follow-through, statements and events that utterly contradicted the established canon of the past two seasons, sweeping generalizations and cringe-worthy cliches, reused plots, incomprehensible reasoning, boring filler mysteries and more boring still filler guest stars. The level of humor on the show has dropped, as well. Always racy and teetering on the edge of a FCC fine, it nevertheless used to elicit laughter. This year it tumbled down to the groin level. No longer risqué but simply crude, a lot of jokes felt as if they were lifted from a frat house bulletin. Which would have at least made sense if the said jokes were made by any of the number of frat boys appearing this season. Instead, they were glibly uttered by Veronica.     2. The mysteries. Instead of one main mystery arc (or two, as in second season), it was decided to go with several shorter ones. Fair enough, and it sounded like an idea worth exploring, Fewer clues to scatter, less time to forget the ones already offered, and a more dynamic pace. Sadly, all we got was \\"less.\\" Less compelling cases, less attention to accuracy and details, less logic and motivation, less impact or meaning, less actual interest in seeing any of it through. What we had more of were the cliches. Cliched villains, cartoon version of feminists (bogey-woman edition to scare little frat boys at nights), wig-wearing \\"clever\\" criminal easily foiled by Veronica, insulting and harmful handling of sensitive and complex subjects. And a few victims impossible to care about. After two of these so-called arcs came the stand-alone episodes. Two of which were basically thinly disguised Public Service Announcements, and the remaining three blatantly recycling previously used plot lines. And in the end, there was no pay-off, only wasted potential, frustration, and fatigue.    3. The characters. The complex, established players the audience knew and cared about either sidelined, relegated to 3-minute appearances for the exposition purposes, or rendered unrecognizable by sudden personality changes. Keith Mars looked all season as if he lost a lot of IQ points during the summer (his utter blindness over his daughter's behavior and actions was incomprehensible and unlike Keith of the past). Logan, a fighter and a survivor, was presented as downtrodden and defeated for most of the season (downtrodden and defeated by Veronica, no less, made to audition for her tenuous good opinion again and again). Wallace became Waldo, a hard-to-find guy who popped up for 30 seconds to explain the obvious every three episodes or so. Weevil all but disappeared, too, and when he did appear, his actions were incomprehensible and contradicted each other from week to week. Instead, several new regulars were introduced (presumably to capture the elusive \\"new\\" viewers and failing at it spectacularly), taking up screen time but offering little. Underwritten and underwhelming, shoe-horned in and forgettable, impossible to take seriously (A trivial, moppet-haired, wide-eyed over-grown child named Piz that comes from Beaverton? It's as if the writers wanted him to be mocked mercilessly.). They may as well have been wearing T-shirts with \\"Plot Device\\" written on them. Yet time was dedicated to their presence. Time that could have been used for an interesting mystery, some actual character-development for the main heroine or for the exploration of all that potential set up in season 2. Most actors, old and new, did what they could with the poor material given to them, but they were handicapped from the start.\\"Veronica Mars\\" used to be lauded as the show that rewarded viewers who paid attention. Now it became the show that punished those with good memory. In its quest to attract new audience, the show alienated a large chunk of the old one that followed it from the start.      4. And then there was Veronica. Once sympathetic and strong, she suddenly became irritating and waffling. She acted more like a defensive victim this season than in previous two. From confident she graduated to smug. Where she used to be assertive, she became pushy. Once a seeker of justice, she now appeared simply vindictive and petty. Her aspiration was to join the FBI, yet she broke the law on a weekly basis without batting an eyelash. A victim of assault herself, she had no problem mocking a male victim of the same. She was touted as incredibly bright, yet she put herself in situations of mind-numbing stupidity that a child of five would have known to avoid. She was brittle and shrill. Her once touching relationship with Keith was reduced to hair-raisingly inappropriate series of slapstick and quips of sexual nature, lying and an occasional platitude. Maybe all of this would not have been so glaring or impossible to take, had some reason been given for her escalated behavior. It wasn't as if they couldn't find any. Veronica has had enough trauma in her short life to send ten people running to the nearest shrink. Yet nothing was acknowledged, so she marched through the season, uncalled on her behavior and lauded for her actions, as if they were something to be admired. Perhaps she's always been this way, but this year Kristen Bell's performance failed to deliver enough subtext, show enough of underlying vulnerability, for the outer shell not to be off-putting.    I am sad to see this promising and beloved series end with such a down season. It wasn't all bad; it had its share of flashes of great performances, unexpected moments, memorable lines and a compelling episode or two. But it was a far cry from season 1 (and even 2). So much so, it was a relief, not a disappointment, to see the show go when the cancellation was announced.

It touches on the preventable tragedies that cannot be blamed on any one person, but that lay the blame on every one of us who don't reach out to a suffering child. It is sad that we have to learn about this, but that is the only way to combat it.

0452282152|5.0|Tracy Chevalier's  narrative of Griet, Jan Vermeer's domestic servant, is an intriguing project. The fact that the book is so fascinating is simply marvelous. In the same manner that the artist's work glows and captures our imagination, so does this book spark curiousity and hold our interest.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|A marvelously bittersweet (and certainly five star) film which gets under your skin and doesn't let go.  I'm writing this review to say that if you enjoy reading, please buy the book and read it before experiencing the film.   Choices must always be made in what to bring to the screen and what to leave out; good choices were made here.  The film works incredibly well on its own.  For those who might want to read the book as well, a couple of off-hand remarks near the beginning of the book give away a major plot point of whose importance we are not yet aware.  Having already seen the film, it made the book much harder (and, sadly, less enjoyable) to read.
B00009Z574|5.0|Update- April 6, 2014<br /><br />I'm sorry but I STILL love Tormato!  *dodges rotten tomatoes*<br /><br />*dodges second batch due to horrible pun*<br /><br />Despite the initial shock of witnessing what appeared to be a very gross, horror-like album cover (haha, doesn't it remind you of someone committing a grisly murder or perhaps more accurately a comparison to the intentionally hilarious and now cult-famous movie Attack of the Killer Tomatoes?) the actual songwriting is really phenomenal, and repeated listens doesn't make me think any less of the music here.<br /><br />Truthfully, the reason I enjoy Tormato is because it really sounds like the band is taking their familiar style of progressive rock with the space rock guitars, the groovy bass work and odd time signatures and shortening the songs to make them more accessible to the listeners.  That's the only crime this album is committing in my opinion which is easily forgivable.  The exaggerated negativity surrounding this album is pretty astounding and has reached to outrageous proportions.  For me to totally disagree with the negative feelings so strongly just goes to show I have a different view of Yes than probably most people do.  Even Jon Anderson's robotic vocal melodies which I'm normally not a fan of, seem particularly memorable this time around.  The only issue I can see is that the lyrics are often noticeably cheesy and less adventurous.  That's the one criticism I can notice but seriously, I don't care at all.<br /><br />\\"Future Times/Rejoice\\" reminds me of an anthem of some kind with a very deliberate and memorable vocal melody that probably does repeat a few more times than it should (resulting in a song a couple minutes longer than it needs to be) but otherwise it's a highly exciting tune.  \\"Arriving UFO\\" is my favorite song for that one short and snappy synth part that repeats over and over (especially when it does so for an extended period of time near the end).  The vocal melody is pretty cooltoo.  I LOVE the line \\"I could not take it oh so seriously really when you called and said you've seen a UFO\\", lol.  A mockery of the UFO-influenced adventures the band took us on previously during the classic years (and especially on Tales From Topographic Oceans).  \\"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\\" is probably the second best song on the album because it wouldn't be out of place on an album like Relayer due to the many layers of spacey guitar bits that sail and soar throughout the song with an awesome vocal melody in between (especially when it momentarily slows down just for the vocal melody to make a dramatic appearance).<br /><br />\\"Release Release\\" is the one song I happen to hear more than the others- not on FM radio of course, but on XM radio occasionally.  It makes me think the majority agree it's the best song here.  I love the guitar playing in the intro and the speedy pace of the song with all the unusual tricks and time signature changes Yes are known for, with an awesome vocal melody that builds and becomes more intense as the song goes on.  Granted that can be a bad thing if you're someone who struggles to warm up to Jon Anderson's vocal style (me!) but the important thing here is that the song only gets better with repeated listens.  \\"Circus of Heaven\\" is probably the only song that features one questionable moment- that being the voice of a child heard at the end of the song pertaining to the wonderful carefree days a child would experience at the circus.  Then again these lyrics are sort of frightening the way the child says \\"But there were no clowns, lions, tigers or bears\\".  Makes me think of a perfect setting for a horror movie if you ask me!  The swirling-like vocal melody that takes up the first half is really charming and much happier than the creepy ending however.<br /><br />\\"Don't Kill the Whale\\" is pure funkiness with perhaps cheesy lyrics, but admittedly really enjoyable vocals.  \\"Onward\\" is one of the bands most touching ballads, thoughit's incredibly simplistic and straightforward, and \\"Madrigal\\" is based around a Renaissance-style folkish tune with beautiful and elegant harpsichords.  I have nothing but good things to say about all the songs featured on Tormato really.  If only Attack of the Killer Tomatoes used some of these songs for their movie, man, how awesome would THAT have been!
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|As the story opens, high school student and former drug dealer Brendan Frey (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) receives a cryptic message from his ex-girlfriend, Emily.  She dropped him when she started hanging out with the popular kids, and now she's missing.  Brendan's search leads him through a maze of nasty jocks and violent drug dealers and eventually leads to Emily's dead body.  Now Brendan must find the killer - is it the local drug lord, the drama queen, the hit man, or the enigmatic cheerleader?<br /><br />If you're looking for something really different, \\"Brick\\" is for you.  Rian Johnson wrote and directed \\"Brick\\" as an homage to the film noir style of the forties.  To call the characters and dialogue \\"hard-boiled\\" would be an understatement. They are all jaded and calloused and see little or no value in life.  They speak in a teen/drug code that is so unique I actually had to turn on the subtitles to understand it.  That didn't detract from the movie, however.  Once I figured out what the slang meant, it was a fascinating new language.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt has matured a lot since he was in [[ASIN:B000NQJPW0 3rd Rock From the Sun]].  He carries the movie with his James Dean-charisma and brooding charm.  Lukas Haas gives a subtle, eerie performance as a club-footed drug lord.  There is only one adult in the movie, making the teens seem even more alone and alienated from mainstream society.  This is a moody, intense, and unflinching look at the teen drug world (and it's interesting that there are no curse words, no drugs are mentioned by name, and no drugs are taken on camera.)  Highly recommended.
B000O599XK|4.0|As my birthday is creeping up and this film was released in 59 and I shall turn 59 in June (07) I felt like splurging for the Two Disc Ultimate Rio Bravo. Happy I did. I love westerns but didn't know this film that well, thought I had seen it but realized when I started to unspool it that I had never seen it all the way through. It's a terrific film, I have other westerns favorites that I feel are superior; The Searchers, Winchester 73 (I think that's the caliber), One Eyed Jack etc., but this is very good and the packaging is terrrific. You even get a re print of The Dell comic of the film (reduced in size of course) also there is the advertising circular that Warners sent out to theatre owners. As for the film, it's The Duke at his Dukest and Dean Martin is pretty good, Ricky Nelson could never act but looks good on screen...Angie Dickenson steals the picture...in black tights even. Happy with my purchase and you will be too.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|Neil Young's young voice is somewhat angelic and hauntingly beautiful. If you only purchase one Neil Young CD in your lifetime this should be the one. Pure and simple, he is at his greatest without any of the dubbing.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|There seems to be a gigantic division on this new release, between those who wanted more of what they'd come to expect and those who desired a big change. Some of the latter were still disappointed but it's clear that people generally feel fifty/fifty about the new direction. Instead of debating who they now sound like or anything pointless, I'll just review each track and hopefully that'll help someone make a decision about whether to purchase it amidst the controversy. <br /> <br />Wake - The intro, not a whole lot to say here except that it slowly builds and the tones seem to encapsulate what the album itself attempts. It makes you think of the \\"deep\\" side of Linkin Park, as in \\"Crawling\\" or \\"In The End\\" or \\"Breaking the Habit\\". Then it pops and unleashes rock upon the palette. Get used to this sequence of events. <br /> <br />Given Up - This is a pretty harsh rock song. It also goes for perhaps a cheap shock effect by throwing the f-bomb right in the listener's face, but it's still a well composed anger tune. And Chester's yelling has never sounded better in my opinion. He hits ridiculous amounts of notes throughout this CD and the chorus here sells it early. <br /> <br />Leave Out All The Rest - A slow and enriched ballad, with a fair amount of synth and rock power to accompany Chester's voice. The melodic element of this new musical style is brought forward on this track, also a trend that continues on the CD. The song keeps on rolling from start to finish and has a nice touch of cello supporting it. <br /> <br />Bleed It Out - Probably the closest thing to regular Linkin Park on the whole album. Both singers are clearly displayed, with Mike kicking it off rapping and bringing Chester in for the chorus. It also has lots of background clapping and yelling, providing an underground party atmosphere that is reminiscent of Sublime's fun element. <br /> <br />Shadow of the Day - A beautiful moment of the CD, drawn more closely to the tone of the intro than any other track. It is a ballad by all means, drenched in a wonderful building synth and emotion twisting guitar work. Chester's chorus is brilliant and the singing is absolutely flawless, along with the tune that accompanies it. Experiencing it's evolution as the song progresses is like nothing else. My personal favorite. <br /> <br />What I've Done - The big single. It has more trademark LP lyrics than the others, kind of abstract but easy for anyone to relate their life to. It has plenty of rock, bordering on another ballad but hits too hard for that monicker. Most people were appreciative of it as something they would expect to hear. <br /> <br />Hands Held High - Next to \\"Shadow of the Day\\", this is another enlightening moment of the album. Mike's rapping takes precedence as he rattles off on the United States' issues, bringing in a refreshing view on the problems of everyday people along with his own personal experience. Instead of outrightly targeting wars or involvements, he addresses what is happening inside the country and how the world is looking at our leadership. A boot camp worthy drum cadence teams up with a church organ and synthed out choir to bring an element of prophecy to the track. <br /> <br />No More Sorrow - The roughest rock song on the CD. Right from the beginning the deep and grinding guitars let you know where it's going, and the song doesn't disappoint any cravings for harshness. Those who heard about cursing on the album probably would expect it here, but smartly Chester gets his message out without a single one. The song addresses the more aggressive aspect of discontent, where \\"Hands Held High\\" was more thoughtful and introspective. <br /> <br />Valentine's Day - Almost sickeningly indulgent, this song brings forward a very real and personal pain. The lyrics are sung rather softly and with air to it, like someone out of breath with desperation. It's a definite ballad and totally seperates the link between rap-rock and this CD. It makes a nicetransition for the more roots oriented spin of the last few tracks. <br /> <br />In Between - A nice tune that brought images of much older groups to my mind. Mike sings throughout and never pushes it hard, just lets his message softly drift out with wisdom and ecclectic taste. I imagine the Beatles would be impressed by the abilities showcased here, and reminds us that Mike has now made two largely impactful songs and is not as some say gone from the album. <br /> <br />In Pieces - Rather bizarre song with a ballad beginning that ends up pushing at the edges of a powerful rock anthem but never quite crosses over and puts the voltage necessary to make it actually harsh. This is not a bad thing; the anxious waiting to see where it leads makes the song worth the fun, and his bitter lyrics set us up for the realizations of the transcendant ending. <br /> <br />The Little Things Give You Away - A remarkable ode to Katrina victims, outrightly expressing frustration at how easily people forget the pain of others in favor of furthering their own continuing success. It's message is clear but is something anyone could level with, and the folk shades on the track make it a quite unique and respectable turn for Linkin Park.  <br /> <br />To conclude I think the experiment is genius. Meteora felt like a remixed version of Hybrid Theory to me, and this CD stands out as having good effort put into it. Too many artists pump out rehashed junk and nobody can accuse them of playing it safe with this album. I highly recommend it.
B00005JLEX|5.0|This show ranks up there with the greatest tv shows of all time. These early episodes are interesting,even if the show had not hit it's peak yet. The episodes plus lots of extras makes this a worthy purchase.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I love all things of the occult and the supernatural and this show Supernatural delivers it all. If you like anything horroesque you will love this series. It does one thing I think above all of it's other amazing qualities is that at times you as a viewer really can't see a happy ending for the brothers, it delivers a sense of hopelessness. I mean come on they're practically fighting HELL all on their own. and the odds are not on their side. the FBI opened a special investigating team just to get them off the streets for christ sakes. Everybody has got it out for them! I just don't know how they are both going to survive another season. I think they need some backup other than Bobby. I personally give it a 10 of 5 stars.
6305291446|4.0|This entry into the halloween series is probably about as good as it is gonna get! After two really really bad installments(parts 5 and 6) we get a pretty darn good sequel \\"Halloween H20\\". The best thing about the movie is that Jamie Lee Curtis is back and it makes all the difference. I still don't understand why they keep changing Michael's mask? It looked great in the first movie...why fix what ain't broke? This movie is really a 3 and 1/2 star movie,but they don't have that option. The DVD transfer is good,but I would like to see a 16X9 upgrade someday.

B0000B1OFL|4.0|I live right around the corner from a Mini Coop dealership and I'm an Italian-American, so I thought it fitting that I finally rented this movie.  It's a remake of the 1969 original starring Michael Caine.  Whereas that film took place in Italy, the remake stays there only for the introduction and then swiftly moves to California.<br /><br />I love heist films.  Like Ocean's Eleven or Heat, it's all about the cast.  You can see a pattern in the characters:<br /><br />THE WHEELMAN: This is the guy who mans the getaway vehicle, be it helicopter, jet, or car.  Handsome Rob (Jason Statham, my favorite action hero) plays a decidedly scrappy, suave wheelman.  This also happens to be almost the exact character from The Transporter.  Hopefully, Statham will move beyond this type of character, but it's a testament to action tropes that he can actually be typecast as \\"the wheelman.\\"<br /><br />THE TECH: This guy is almost always a nerd and usually the comic relief.  Lyle (Seth Green) nails this role and actually steals the show with his jokes.  One ad-libbed sequence of Lyle mocking Handsome Rob is the funniest part of the movie.  Of course, the challenge with this sort of character is that he needs to be able to pull off seemingly magical feats of technological wizardry without overshadowing the expertise involved.  When Lyle manages to take control of the entire traffic system, you really have to wonder if he couldn't be better off striking out on his own.  He's almost too good for the movie.<br /><br />THE DEMOLITIONIST: The demolitionist's job is to blow things up.  Sometimes he's a homicidal maniac, other times he's cool and collected.  Left Ear (Mos Def) is a cool customer. And he doesn't like dogs. He gives Lyle competition for the funniest line in the movie:<br /><br />Left Ear: This dude got dogs. I don't do dogs... I had a real bad experience, man.<br /><br />Charlie Croker: What happened?<br /><br />Left Ear: I had. A bad. Experience.<br /><br />THE OLD MAN: You've seen this guy before.  He's probably the former leader of the group.  He's seen too much, been around the block too many times, and he knows his days are numbered.  He just wants one last, big heist so he can retire forever.  He almost always dies in the film.  That pretty much sums up John Bridger (Donald Sutherland).<br /><br />THE HOT CHICK: A recent invention, the hot chick's purpose is to keep men interested.  She can have a variety of roles (tech, wheel-err-woman, demolitionist).  Sometimes she has her own unique set of skills as safecracker.  That's John's daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron), who competes admirably in the sea of testosterone.<br /><br />THE LEADER: Handsome, smart, a safecracker himself, this guy is the one who pulls off a sneaky job right under the bad guys' noses. Unfortunately, Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) is more narrator than anything else.  He seems to have very little to do, and that's a shame, because Wahlberg's talented enough to do much more.<br /><br />The villain is Steve (Edward Norton) a thief turned bad. He knows all of our protagonists' tricks, so he knows how to counter them.  And since he stole the gold from the original Italian Job, he's the perfect foil.  Norton plays him with just the right amount of shifty-eyed sleaze.<br /><br />The Italian Job has lots of cool car chases, lots of near misses, and a lot of twists and turns (literally and figuratively) that make it a brisk, entertaining movie.  You get quickly caught up in the machinations of the characters, which allows the film to get away with a lot of unbelievable nonsense.  But who cares? From the funky flashbacks to the quippy asides, it's clear that Italian Job doesn't take itself too seriously.<br /><br />Although it's more Job than Italian, the Italian Job is still a fun ride.AN: You've seen this guy before.  He's probably the former leader of the group.  He's seen too much, been around the block too many times, and he knows his days are numbered.  He just wants one last, big heist so he can retire forever.  He almost always dies in the film.  That pretty much sums up John Bridger (Donald Sutherland). <br /> <br />THE HOT CHICK: A recent invention, the hot chick's purpose is to keep men interested.  She can have a variety of roles (tech, wheel-err-woman, demolitionist).  Sometimes she has her own unique set of skills as safecracker.  That's John's daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron), who competes admirably in the sea of testosterone.  <br /> <br />THE LEADER: Handsome, smart, a safecracker himself, this guy is the one who pulls off a sneaky job right under the bad guys' noses. Unfortunately, Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) is more narrator than anything else.  He seems to have very little to do, and that's a shame, because Wahlberg's talented enough to do much more.  <br /> <br />The villain is Steve (Edward Norton) a thief turned bad. He knows all of our protagonists' tricks, so he knows how to counter them.  And since he stole the gold from the original Italian Job, he's the perfect foil.  Norton plays him with just the right amount of shifty-eyed sleaze.  <br /> <br />The Italian Job has lots of cool car chases, lots of near misses, and a lot of twists and turns (literally and figuratively) that make it a brisk, entertaining movie.  You get quickly caught up in the machinations of the characters, which allows the film to get away with a lot of unbelievable nonsense.  But who cares? From the funky flashbacks to the quippy asides, it's clear that Italian Job doesn't take itself too seriously.  <br /> <br />Although it's more Job than Italian, the Italian Job is still a fun ride.  <br />
B000FSME1A|5.0|I bought this from the U.K. because the version we had over here was in a word s**t, the packaging is a great extra in the form of a folder and the fact that it features both versions of the films plus commentaries from thw always informative Coppola plus some great extras. throughly worth the money I shed out on it.
